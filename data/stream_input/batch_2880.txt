B00A11AN6O|5.0|This is really nice to have, as it uploads your phone camera photos and then you can delete them, but still have them later to share on your phone or computer.  Great idea.,
0307891372|5.0|Unless you're a hardcore Elder Scrolls fan and you wanna have the special edition guide then this has you covered. There's so many stuff to go through in this game this guide is a must.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|PURCHASED and did play it for a few hours non stop, n<br />ow it doesn't work&hellip;sadly disappointed!! Would just LOVE to be able to play it again!!
B000063DFN|5.0|Just plain awesome and music to the ears . I believe as this y-gen runs it's course with its throw away music they may discover this mighty metal Juggernaut for hard hitting riffs and vocally understood lyrical masterpieces.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I liked this book because it made me think about live and being present.  It's not about how much you get done every day but that you enjoy each moment.  I hope I can enjoy my life more and appreciate each moment because it will go by so fast.  I love books that make me think!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Scary really how it does guess what you'll say, but does making typing easy when you just select the words that this program tells you that you are going to say next... Good visuals, easier to use than Swype and much more intuitive. Good product for the price of free!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Having never listened to Amon Amarth before, I didn't really know what to expect. What I got was some really awesome metal devoid of any shredding, a far simpler approach than my usual tastes. But you know what, it works. The lyrics are all about the Vikings' exploits and stories steeped in Norse mythology. All of the songs have this &#34;epic&#34; feel to them. Maybe it's the liberal use of triplet time, or the lyrics, or the scales, or all of it. Whatever. The point is, this is some really fun metal, and if you're like me and used to highly technical, dissonant metal, give this a shot anyway. You might find it's a surprising breath of fresh air.
B00BRUPICM|1.0|If I may be so bold, I'd like to begin at the end and say there's definitely a \\"disturbance in the creative force.\\" Or at least that was my first thought after completing this novel.<br /><br />If I didn't want to embrace books with a warm hug and proceed to shove them out into the world by talking about them, promoting them, and engaging in lively discussions with informed readers across the space and time continuum for the rest of my life without fail, I could very easily just write ALEX off and move on with my life, rubbing my palms together, and then ducking under an overpass while the train rocks the tracks above my head. But that wouldn't be okay, and it certainly isn't a productive use of my time. Maybe I'm half-sensitive, half-crazy, prone to second-guessing, and have enough of an ego that I feel like I need to somehow be a productive member of society and make some sort of contribution before I dissipate off this Earth faster than a fart in the New Mexican wind, so here we are, wonderful reader and I, dancing the tango over yet another book review. Where I hope to impart a few thoughts, informed opinions, and constructive criticisms, and you can pretend that you actually give a flying fart.<br /><br />Here are a few of the issues:<br />Constant telling to the point that I wanted to rip my hair out? Check.<br />Inside Alex's head way too much, to the point that I could set up camp, read a newspaper, and smoke a cigarette while balancing a tumbler on my left knee? Check.<br />Shaggy dialogue? Check.<br />Exclamation point minefields? Check.<br />Not getting to the point? Check.<br />Am I making myself clear? No.<br />Piss-poor similes and metaphors? Check.<br />Overstated, redundant, bloated prose? Check.<br />Stilted, stiff, wooden, overformal, mannered, and pretentious dialogue? Check.<br />Overemphasis on ellipses? Check.<br />Repetitious to the point that I thought I had developed CRS disease? Check.<br />Drama and heightened tension sucked out of the prose faster than a Hoover by mediocre writing? Check.<br />Excessive stammering to the point that I wanted to offer speech lessons? Check.<br />Mystery? Possibly but it was a side car on this happy train.<br />A supposed thriller minus most of the thrills? Check.<br />Plenty of clich&eacute;s? Check.<br />Immediate and unexplained epiphanies? Check.<br />Brings words like pussyfooting to the foray? Check.<br />Penchant for passive voice? Check.<br />Almost seemed to switch POV in the middle of a few scenes? Check.<br />Editing comments that were both annoying and frustrating and over explained the difference between French and English? Check. (This should be fixed upon the official release, otherwise readers are in for a real treat.)<br /><br />For the first two-thirds or so of this tale, Alex Prevost just might have been my least favorite character of all time. I'm not sure I could have looked at her, or even been in the same room with her, and being in her head for so long proved rather torturous, corrupting me on more than one level. *BEGIN SPOILER* But once I did understand the motivations for her actions, she did grow on me however slightly, even though it was probably a bit too late in the game for me to come full circle in my way of thinking. And the ending itself proved a bit farfetched even for this roller-coaster-induced tale. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />If I didn't already have some sort of complex where I tend to question myself, ponder the meaning of life, and seek out both the good in people and books, I might be perfectly fine with writing two one-star reviews in a row. But I can't help but feel as though I have somehow failed the universe.<br /><br />Upon finishing ALEX, I don't really feel anger or frustration or fury or annoyance, I feel a lingering, profound sadness that hangs over me like the sun, a sense of defeat and loss and despair that clings to me like a wet t-shirt, and then I don't really feel much of anything at all.<br /><br />I received this book for free through NetGalley.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorfor free through NetGalley.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely like this game...need more apps like this one. Myst is one of my favorite games and this has the same game thrill.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Love this game. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. The graphics are great, and just a fun game all around.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did a fantastic job keeping me as the reader on my toes during this book. It was romantic and intense all in one story.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|This movie was ridiculous in its premise and did a terrible job with the development of the characters. Apart from the cinematography being stunning, Tom Cruise delivers another self indulgent performance complete with a scene where he fights himself. I feel confident that if the director would have allowed it Tom would have tried to play every part in the movie. All in all way too hard to follow and has a real lack of character(s) you can root for. If sleep is what you need, rent it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a great read - engaging, sad, funny, smart, real, and touching. It approaches a very serious topic with wit and humor, while not negating the importance of the situation for the main characters. I would highly recommend it (with a box of tissues) to anyone, not just teens.
B004P7CN5O|5.0|This was for a friend. He never saw this movie and wanted to see it. He was very happy to receive the gift.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome!! its so fun and entertaining especially for horse lovers and the best part is that its not just for young children, its for anyone who loves horses and enjoys fun games that never seem to end:)
0634022296|5.0|This was for a friend who is practicing to play the guitar. He was very happy to receive the book. He'll have plenty of songs to practice with.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|So far, the game is interesting. I like the different locations, but the tutorial can be a little annoying &amp; redundant. The story line is fun, and being patient it's your best bet to enjoy the game without spending any REAL money.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|TeamViewer  is perfect for those of us that  need remote technical assistance to access our computer in order to help us work on complex programs . It is also perfect for remote troubleshooting problems by remote control.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i really love this show, i realky like shows that arecset in the old british times. i cant wait for the next season.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not bad pretty fun to play kind of like the facebook apps. Runs fast on my kindle and even better that its free.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|loved it all in all it was second best of the year and would buy it when I have the money
B00AHDXTIK|2.0|Hello, I purchased this item almost 2 weeks ago and yesterday it arrived, however that wasn't the problem. Upon using the cable yesterday for the first it worked perfectly. Then i used the cable again however this time the tip where it gets connected to the iphone simply broke, who should i talk to about this problem. Kindly assist me, i have pictures to prove it too.
B00688628M|5.0|The sacrifice of these men and the life lessons they teach through this epic series are the reason any of us are even able to purchase items when we want and how we want. Band of Brothers is the top of the line in how a story should be told.
140006922X|5.0|the book is a winner, once you start reading it, you don'nt want to put it down. I have learned more about jesus then I have in the last 60yrs. of my life.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is an awesome app no flaws!!! If you are reading this...do it..click that button. Multiple alarms and u can set ur own tune and I love the feature that lets you dim the lights and the multiple clock settings.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The most well-crafted and riveting TV Series Saga I've ever seen. Acting, screenplay and production all excellent. Modern day America.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a simple spirit lifting story. It give hope to all those who have fallen to despair that the world can be a better place.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|The most well-crafted and riveting TV Series Saga I've ever seen. Acting, screenplay and production all excellent. Modern day America.
B008602KQI|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel. Loved the movie but I don't have time to read the books so I will wait for the hopefully many sequels to come
B00DP8XSQ2|2.0|Not a good app on the Kindle - display is confusing - may run better on other 'droids. I understand that IPad has one that is sensational, but then that is a sensational gadget.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Super fun game for horse like myself!!! :) would recommend this game to all my friends. I love the graphics on this game as well.
B0012GTZFC|5.0|A great perspective on leadership that I will now be adding to the list of readings I give my leadership students.
B002RSU9PY|5.0|Great movie. Timeless. This is a movie that can be shared with the family (older kids) and enjoyed by all. This is not a horror film but is full of suspense. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore.
B008ROF114|3.0|If you like westerns, and John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Rick Nelson, you will like this film.  It is what it is, and for an evenings entertainment that is sometimes enough.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard that I have used. I love how accurate the predictions are. Hard to go back to standard keyboard after using this one.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|Who couldn't love a movie with a young buff Keanu Reeves and handsome as always Patrick Swayze?  This movie is action packed and has beautiful scenes with the beaches and the skydiving.  Sure its a movie, and no one really jumps out of a plane with no parachute...but it makes for good tv.  I will always enjoy this movie on a rainy afternoon.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I enjoyed this more than book one, for sure.  I look forward to continuing to read the remainder of the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Wish there were more floors.  We need an update as soon as possible please. Would pay for more levels.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Interesting theories and assumptions but its just that, theories and assumption. I enjoyed the history of the time and the insight but that link didn't seem to be there. I did enjoy the book.
1451627297|5.0|Not the normal Stephen King novel.  Nothing scary or mind boggeling; just a trip down memory lane in the 60s.  Remember when gasoline was 30 cents a gallon?  Hard to believe that was only 50 years ago.  Remember colored versus white entrances?  What if President Kennedy was never assinated?  What would the world be like if that was prevented?  Stephen King did a great job with all of the tiny things in that era and is such a good writer that you want to read every word.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved this book! All the experiments are so interesting and worked within the time frame. I would definitely recommend it if you liked The Secret and are interested in the law of attraction.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Easy read. Great story and futuristic ideas that obviously inspired a lot of modern day day books and movies. Couldn't put this down!
B009G41CG2|5.0|numerous tile layouts to choose from. I found this to be very challenging to do. I would recommend this download if you are looking for a challenging game.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is great hidden picture and puzzle game.  The only down side is that it will take a long time to complete the game unless you are willing to fork out money to buy extra tools and crystals.  Also, everything is timed.  So, when you use some of your talismen to help increase the number  of coins, crystals and experience you earn; they are on a time limit too.  So this game all boils down to which is more important to you: time or money?
B000093BDX|5.0|Price was very good!! It was all the good hits that they sang in the concert we saw at the Mohegan Sun this summer!!!!!!!Great sound-great songs!!!!!!!Thanks!
B002KDUDG6|3.0|CD in great condition - Awesome Music - Communication was excellent - Timely delivery as promised - Only problem it doesn't play on my computer!
B00CXQL828|5.0|What a great band! Stellar musicians. Get it! Best Rock album in years! Great song and great great playing and singing...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love playing Mahjong. This is fun to have on the Kindle and be able to play when I'm stuck in a line somewhere.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Enjoyed the show and the acting was excellent.  The writing was a bit sketchy at times. Very easy to download on my amazon cloud.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have always loved this wonderful classic. I bought this book to remember the joy I felt as a child reading about a secret place.
0062255657|3.0|I read this book at the prompting of a friend.  It's really not my kind of book.  I'd rather stay in the world of reality.  While I wasn't really enjoying it, there was something about it that enticed me to keep going.  I like his writing style and I guess I wanted to see how it would end.  But the story didn't do much for me. If there was a point in it, I missed it.  All the while I was reading I was wondering if I should be seeing some deeper meaning in the story or if there was some real life analogy I should be getting and learning from.  The bottom line is that I can't decide if I liked it or didn't like it.  If I had to sum it up in a few words I would say that it's somewhat entertaining and weird.
B0086700CM|2.0|This game wasn't one for me. I'm sure others will find it fun and exciting. I just didn't find it as a challenge.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works well with the other devices but the programs are very limited. So it isn't something that will replace roku or apple tv. If you only have netflix then this is the product for you.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I wasn't sure what I expected with this program. I wasn't overly impressed with it. I don't play it any more.
B0039O8AQK|1.0|boring stupid lame dumb not worth seeing read the book watch with french subtitles drink something to alter the mind
B004SBQGHS|3.0|This is a fun game more for children. I didn't find anything captivating about it as an adult. I guess you can be entertained if you like repetition.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Money well spent. Would recommend this app to anyone if they are looking for something of this nature. Have fun, drink beer,GO SOONERS.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is just the basic solitaire game that is on every computer. I like having it on the Kindle to play when I'm away from home.
145210655X|4.0|I love it, but the sheets were glue, and i tear the sheets when i tried to remove the glue. :(
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As always, David Baldacci writes a fantastic book! I love everyone that he writes. He makes the characters so believable and the story moves right along. I am always disappointed when I come to the end of one of his books because I want it to go on!
1552091090|5.0|I had this for my daughters and now made sure I bought a new one for my granddaughters. Such a beautiful story athat touches the heart of every parent.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I haven't really played many of these games. You have to win certain ones to open up other games to play. Some of them are confusing and so I just didn't bother.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Please note my review of the DVD for information on the movie itself.<br /><br />While I have the DVD, I downloaded the movie as part of an experiment to see if I could transfer it to my laptop which doesn't have a DVD player.  (It's old and creaky just like me.)  This worked so I plan to get more TV shows and movies to follow it to that machine.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the video quality since I don't tend to favor WMV format however my fears were not born out; the quality compares quite well to the DVD.  Overall, if you have a DVD player, get the DVD.  If not, get this.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|This was a good movie. I didn't like it as much as I liked the book and wish I would have just rented it instead of buying it.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Decent action footage but over all it's kind of sad to see this collection of over the hill action stars throughout the film
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Like all the other Nicholas Spark Movies, this one is no exception. It's a great movie to watch again and again!
B00687Q0VC|5.0|For a TV Mini-series, this is about as good as it gets.  A Revolutionary War era version of Band of Brothers
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game it is great I recommend it to lots of people. It's is fun and a blast
B00BQ83TMG|5.0|I hope Uhtred's story never ends! It's very refreshing to read about a pagan hero and to see Christianity portrayed from it's proper perspective.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Because of this movie, my husband now bears the responsibility for picking the worst movie we've ever seen (a burden I've carried for a long time).  Best of all, this film was so masterfully horrific, there's virtually no chance I will ever carry that dubious distinction again.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|This will keep you on the edge of your seat with the great movie and the music, which is a perfect match. For best results, watch it on a HD TV with surround sound and turn it up. You will feel like you are in the movie.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I am obsessed with this show and needed the limited edition for my collection. The item looks really cool, and I'm sure the blu ray is also nice.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|I thought this movie was just hilarious. Usual clueless typecast college teenagers camping in woods and then meeting scruffy local rednecks plot - - only this plot is reversed as the local guys are really the good guys and many clever and humorous hijinks occur. An excellent &#34;B&#34; movie all around. Watch clueless college kids die in funny ways...Rank's up there with Bruce Campbell's &#34;Army of Darkness&#34; as one of the best of its &#34;B&#34; genre.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was fantastic!  I don't know why people are complaining about it being short, I mean yes it's shorter than some of his other books, but it's its own story for heaven's sake!  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is frankly terrifying at times, but the boy is just very real and the Hempstock family is so magical and I just want more of them!  This is a great fantasy/fairy tale kind of story and I recommend it to anyone who reads that type of thing.
1444777556|5.0|Excellent read! I read it in one night. I love the frank honesty of the writer. I absolutely love James & Street Cat Bob.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game to play. Lots to do. I make money very quick it's wonderful! I recommend it to all the people who want to get it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I usually spend a few weeks reading a book, but I literally couldn't put &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; down!  Fantastic story; loved the writing style of this incredibly engaging author!
B0082Z447U|4.0|Wilkie Collins wrote the book on how to write a murder mystery...He really did..<br />He was a very close friend of Charles Dickens, and I believe influenced him quite a bit...
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Four stars because this is a good series but I am growing tired of sequels...be done with the story, please.  Scenes are still sizzling and the luxury lifestyle still there but I'm ready to have an ending to the story.
098478280X|5.0|I bought the book, spent quite a while reading and working through the problems, went for the interview, and got the job!  This book left me well prepared for my technical interview, and I hadn't even gotten to the hard questions yet.  This book is an excellent interview prep tool full of knowledge and good questions, with very good solutions and followup points.  I recommend it whole-heartedly; a keeper for sure.  Easily worth the price of admission!
B008US4PBY|4.0|Shipping was fantastic, it arrived 2 days earlier than the expected date.<br />The only problem I have with this is that occasionally, my XB360 controller loses reception (Wireless controller) and I can't reconnect it without unplugging the cronus from my PS3. That doesn't happen more than once per playing session though and sometimes doesn't happen.<br /><br />Everything other than that one issue works as advertised. XB360 Controller on PS3 and vice versa, wired and wireless. all 3rd party controllers I have worked too.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I just love NCIS and I had bought every series up through the 9th year and couldn't wait for tenth season to release.  I have a lot of different TV series and have to admit that NCIS from the 1st year through the 10th has never disappointed me!
1781162646|5.0|I have read Stephen King books for the last 25 years.  He has such a great imagination and write them to where you don't want to put the book down!!
B008P9M614|5.0|I have just recently become a &#34;House&#34; fan and after trying to watch re-runs way out of sequence, I decided to order the series.  Although it will take me several months to get through them all, they seem to be well packaged, there were no loose or scratched discs.  Glad I bought this set.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a must read for anyone interested in the story of Jesus, and how and why we have the scriptures that we have today.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|I'm a huge Stevie Nicks fan so I wasn't really sure I would get into this. After watching I've got to say Great Video. It covered Stevie, Fleetwood Mac and more. Got to see some of how things were done back in the day. Got to say it's worth the watch.
B008P9M614|5.0|I loved the House T.V. series and plan on getting the complete series soon. It is hard to believe (as of this writing) it has been a little over a year since the last episode aired. The series is a medical drama but different than ones like St. Elsewhere or ER. Most of it centers on House, a maverick, antisocial doctor with great diagnostic skills who works with a team of three or so. It has been mentioned a number of times during the series that House likes the puzzle more than the patient but I'm not sure he would go to the lengths he does for every patient if he weren't a truly dedicated doctor.<br /><br />  I liked House's daily verbal assaults, flouting of hospital rules and general hijinks. House kind of reminds me of what Chef Ramsey would be like if he entered the medical profession. You might think initially that House is easy to analyze but if you watch the entire series, especially with the series finale, you'll see he is a difficult act to follow. I won't spoil anything but I enjoyed the series finale, especially the last five and a half minutes. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend buying the complete series of House !!!
1452126577|5.0|Grumpy Cat always makes me laugh! This cute little kitty who, by all reports, is a sweetheart, has words put into her mouth that just give me a lift on the dreariest of days! Great book to give as a present!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great app for kindle fire. Functions as it should &amp; suits its purpose. Ad space is small and at the top of the screen so it is not distracting and you can hold your device without accidentally triggering a pop-up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a well-written book, which I thoroughly enjoyed and I hereby recommend it to<br />Any one who enjoys a mystery.  I think, Gillian Flynn is a good up-and-coming writer and I hope she will have a long writing career ahead of her.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Overall great album. There were a couple of songs I didn't care for because they seemed out of place. I.e. - Touch
0385720920|3.0|I'm kind of happy to have this book done and over with. Not that it was a poorly written book, or hard story to follow...but that it was such a bizarre tale to follow. This was my first Palahniuk book, only ever having seen Fight Club, and I'm intrigued enough to explore more of his creations.<br /><br />Starting, &#34;Damned&#34; next... Then onto, &#34;Doomed&#34;.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to others?<br /> - This book is NOT for children. I feel as though those in the college/ post-college age range will enjoy some of the stories.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting intro into Chuck's writing style.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book it was great. I would suggest this book to people who like reading books then watching a movie. I gab  the book this rating because I thought it was a good book and I wouldn't change anything.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|I enjoyed this game. If the game did not waste my time with ads I might have given the game 5 stars.
B004JHYRDQ|4.0|It is fun to have a mystery story wherein the robot is the suspect even with Asimov's first law of robotics -- 'a robot cannot harm a human being.'
B00992CF6W|5.0|it has so many up dates and it is worth the money get it now it has allmoast everything you could wish for
B008SGMPVU|5.0|This blue Ray is STACKED with extras. Everything from a 3D rendering of the ship to interviews and a Documentary on the film. They are really well presented and go really well with the off beat nature of the film. The Presentation is exquisite and is the Blue Ray. Money well spent. BTW One of the actors and would after this film co-write Alien. A kind of wacky send off on 2001.
B00AG297GK|1.0|This movie is not funny. I couldn't wait for it to be over. There was nothing funny in this movie. I was waiting for this to be over
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The most important parts of this book had to do with the relationship between Paul and the Apostles James, Peter and John, and most importantly explaining the true importance of James (the brother of Jesus).  Another thing that makes this book so interesting is that Aslan writes about the &#34;miracles&#34; as a response by the Gospel writers to what was going on when they wrote the Gospels.  I have read many books about the historical Jesus and this one does fill in some additional plausible gaps.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|well done<br />not as exciting as the book but well worth the experience!<br />Excellent acting and scenery<br />will want to see the next chapter when it comes out soon
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book and so easy to read on the kindle...even my husband is reading it and say it was great
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Samsara is a very touching, powerful movie. There are so many images and shots that are only visible through this movie as they are rare moments captures. A powerful capturing and contrasting of the cycles of life and death.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the book and so easy to read on the kindle...even my husband is reading it and say it was great
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the original movie and was worried about the remake.  But in my opinion the movie does a great job paying tribute to the original Evil Dead while at the same time updating it for the modern horror genre.  Jane Levy is just brilliant in her role as Mia.  The Blu-Ray has some cool special features, mostly the &#34;making of&#34; documentary.  I wish they had included the rumored Director's Cut on this disc but I'm guessing there will be a future release with that on it.
1577314808|5.0|I originally borrowed this book on my Kindle. I found it so thought-provoking and wonderful that I had to buy the paperback version so I could more easily flip through the pages and reread sections. This is the only book by this author I have read to date, but  recommend this one highly.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I wanted the movie because it was made in Lawrence Kansas not far from where I grew up . I remember watching it as a. 14 year old. It was very scary to me back then. But it gave a good insist to what could have happened. And I just wanted it because it was made in Lawrence Kansas
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie is fantastic. Rotten Tomatoes does it justice with an 87%, mutually confirmed by the public's 91%. I'm definitely in agreement with the public, as this movie was visually and intellectually captivating. Enough intrigue to keep you glued to the screen, paired with an equal amount of endearing character development, stunning visuals, and plot twists to make this one definite a \\"Re-Watcher.\\" As most Negative reviews focus on a \\"hating of the man\\" perspective, directed at JJ Abrams and Bad Robot, you can rest assured that this movie will not disappoint if you actually are watching it as a theatrical film, and not with a conspiracy theorist's or hippie's chip on your shoulder.<br /><br />As a long-time Trekkie, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this series mature. Sure it skips over the hard-core geek stuff, but in the end, it helps spread the world of Star Trek to our non-geek friends, without letting us down in the important areas. Again, 10 out of 10. A definite owner.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It's somewhat believable. It moves along. It's not to predictable. Acting is great. Characters are likable.  No commercial s. Good clean show
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|The Chicago Head Cutter proves once again why he is still the most electrifying axe slinger around! Fantastic album, ranks right up with the best of his entire career!<br /><br />BUDDY RULES!
B008645YXA|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums in high school. So, I had to get it on CD. Can't beat the price!
B007SGM084|4.0|NOT EXACTLY MY TYPE OF BOOK BUT ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING AND REVEALING IN THE SUBJECT OF SEX AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR .
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|Great story of the barriers to overcoming fear but the want to be reconciled to each other and the beauty and power of love that creates change. Great acting and celebs.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is very hard to put down once you start doing it! I found several hours had gone by so quickly while playing!
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Loved it! Good movie! Great way to start out this Marvel character for future movies. That is enough of a review. Amazon, you require too many words!
1934609625|3.0|Campion's involvement in this mystery is very minimal.  Instead of starting with the mystery of who did it, the reader is immediately introduced to the murderer and then the plot follows him through other crimes, making Albert's usual surprise revelation of the villain and presentation of the facts of the case totally unnecessary.  I prefer the books where he is the main character; also, I personally dislike spending so much time in the mind of the killer.  For those who don't mind these facts, the mystery should be fine.
0061900656|4.0|We started reading this to my son (19 months old) about 1 month before his baby sister was born.  It really helped with starting the conversation to prepare him for the changes coming.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie!  It is lively, animated, and seems more natural<br />than previous versions.  Matthew Macfadyen is so unaffected as Mr.<br />Darcy, and seems to get beyond the arrogance to portray him as<br />someone uncomfortable reaching beyond his own class.  Keira<br />Knightly is beautiful as Lizzie.  The supporting actors are good<br />as well.  Donald Sutherland is great as the long-suffering Mr. Bennett<br />trying to cope with a houseful of women.  Tom Hollander is superbly<br />droll as Mr. Collins.  The scenery, the music, the costumes enhance<br />the story beautifully.  A  must see!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|An enjoyable, corny and fun film to watch once--not much substance but has an interesting story line and acceptable special effects.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I liked the movie, it's good. But the movie is nothing like the original.<br />It is a completely different movie with the same title.
0143124544|2.0|You will wonder why the two stars when I say that the novel was a page turner. But here's the problem: most of the novel is told by Louise, a young woman who becomes the care-taker of a quadriplegic named Will who had accumulated a small fortune before being mowed over by a motorcycle. There is little evidence that Louise would have had the education to narrate the story was well as she does. Then other characters in the novel such as the medic who works with Will (Nathan), each of Will's parents and Lou's sister narrate little pieces. But their voices are all the same as hers. It doesn't work well, at least not for me. Then there is the ending that is really melodramatic. Yet I have to admit that the story line is so very compelling.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Loved the books...Can't wait for the next one to come out.<br />Everyone has been extra nice with questions and help with my zip code.<br />Thank you....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. Took me about four hours to play off and on. Kept me interested the whole way through. And wasn't so complicated that I couldn't figure out the next step.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Best novel I've read in five years!  The technical details are astounding and accurate.  Buy it, read it, you won't regret it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked the story,  it was very SVU-esque!!!  The ending was a shocker...and there were a few other surprises...overall, I would say it's worth the kindle price!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so hard and i found out on line there is cheats that will tell you how to escape
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Great movie, I've watched this so many times.  I'm waiting for RED 2 to come out on DVD to add to my Bruce Willis collection.
0399226907|5.0|I got this book for my kids, as they are in a huge book stage. I got the board book because they are ages 3 and 1, so I thought it would last longer! They LOVE the book! I get requested to read it multiple times a day! It is perfect for my 3 year old to go alone with and count with!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!!! This one of the best shows on TV right now.I love it and I'm telling all of my friends to watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0425098478|3.0|I purchased these for our sales team. The cover look like it was photo copied.  I will not buy again, I would rather spend the extra money and get a book that looks professional.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|There is never a dull moment on these shows.  I watch them over and over.  They are great. Don't just take my word for it, try it.  Watch an episode and rate it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Book was a \\"can't wait to read what happens next\\".  Once I started, it trumped all other forms of entertainment for me.  It took me down memory lane with all the 80's references and into the future with the virtual world inside the book.  Get it.  Read it.  LOVE IT.
B0007939NO|1.0|this is a cheep product....you get what you pay for....bad ....not clear edited parts  were in the original movie...but not in this version.....i would not purchase anything from this place
B00A27X972|4.0|The story pulls you in and becomes voyeuristic, sneaking peaks at what we are truly like as humans.  The characters are rich and well thought out, and the details transform an otherwise potentially silly concept into an endearing model for all the good within humanity.  I only wish it were longer!  I could have kept reading for days and days.  I want to know more!  A very good choice and highly recommended.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I purchased this and the last two disks didn't even work. The final movie barely worked at all, I'm extremely disappointed
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Another CD referred to by a friend who likes Robert Glasper so i bought this from listening to the samples and liked it..
B00COGXX7A|2.0|Was looking for a romantic movie to watch with my wife. This poor stab at the much better \\"sleeping with the enemy\\" Julia Roberts movie fell short.  Way too much cheesy, Hollywood style romance to keep my attention. At least the ending had an interesting twist to earn it a second star.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome game, love to pretend I am winning money! A wholesome game the whole family can enjoy. Best part ... it's free
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's ok. Only did the tutorial.  Need more time to get the whole picture.  WhY I did seemed like fun but need more time to really assess.
0515153656|3.0|First, I should say that this is not the sort of book I typically read. I'm not really into the real world action/adventure/intrigue plots when it comes to novels. So why did I do it? Because it's hubby's kind of book and I agreed to read it because he agreed to read the first book in a series that I enjoy.<br /><br />I can understand why hubby likes this series. Lots of fight scenes, reasonably believable plotting and, aside from the spelling and grammar errors that stood out to me, it's a pretty smooth read. I can't say that I particularly liked the main character, Jack Reacher - the fact that the image of Tom Cruise was stuck in my head at the beginning didn't help. Then again, I'm not sure he's supposed to be all that likable.<br /><br />Why does it get only two stars? It just wasn't that interesting a novel for me. The plot got boring and I put the book down a couple times, leaving it for a few days before going back to it. I really wasn't all that concerned with making it to the end and finding out who did what and how. And the author's writing style got on my nerves pretty early on. I'm not a fan of overly descriptive prose - it's why I stopped reading Stephen King and Anne Rice years ago. I don't need to know every little detail about a location or a person, yet Lee Child gives it to you anyway. Yes, I know it's Reacher's nature to pay attention to detail, but it just didn't work for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it needs an update horses maybe they need a free skins app though. but I mean battling zombies creepers and my fab skeletons omg FN awesome love mojang
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed The Room. I found it challenging and difficult to put down. If you want to try something different this is it.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Today I tested about 6 YouTube viewers. Taking 1st was Tubemate!! Having minor glitches that could easily be fixed didn't stop the app from having a great use to our daily lives. It loads the videos quickly and shows the textures of the videos perfectly performing stuff that couldn't be done by all the other apps. Though it could use a bit more organization overall, I highly recommend this app!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Lots of challenges and upgrades to keep you coming back for more. Unleashing your hero into battle is a lot of fun. The epic modes are really tough with more planning and strategy required.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the characters on this show, the writing is great and the story lines are great! I highly recommend!
0743270754|5.0|The best histories should be able to make the reader feel as though they are in the time period of the subject matter. Team of Rivals not only puts the reader inside Lincoln's shoes from birth to death, but the shoes of his principal rivals for the Presidential nomination who would become his friends, colleagues, and sources of irritation within his administration.This isn't just another biography of Lincoln, but an intimate look at a presidential administration that bent and threatened to rupture during one the most perilous moments of the young republics history.<br /><br />Doris Kearns Goodwin is a master wordsmith in Team of Rivals. Just to offer two examples,because of her vivid descriptions and eye for detail, the reader almost feels the excitement and disappointment of the Republican convention that made Lincoln a presidential nominee and left William Seward gravely disappointed as though they were on the convention floor themselves. Later, the intensity with which Salomon Chase pursued the presidency for himself just bleeds off the page and enters the readers' consciousness. In these moments, you are effectively Seward and Chase. This spirit extends throughout the entire book.<br /><br />The administration of Abraham Lincoln depicted in Team of Rivals is an administration of highly competent individuals, who were flawed by ambitions and personal rivalries, yet seemed to be the right men at the right time. These rivalries are also depicted in biting and vicious detail that leads to ultimate takeaway that Abraham Lincoln was a political genius to have achieved any meaningful action during his presidency. Yet, while Lincoln is depicted as above the fray of the complexities of his administration, his cabinet is not merely written as a group of petty three year olds fighting over power.<br /><br />To summarize, the reader is transported directly into the 1860's and into the minds of Lincoln and his \\"Team of Rivals\\" as they confronted the challenges of the Civil War. The prose and the imagery cut so deeply that this reader felt as though he was physically running for president or sitting in the cabinet meeting with all these different personalities who frankly didn't always mesh well together. The friendships and hatreds dotted each page.<br /><br />A masterful work of historical scholarship.
B008M721MS|5.0|This new kindle hd I recently bought is really nice! And this Skype app keeps me in thought with my immediate family in Florida all the way from NY! Thanks guys awesome job!!! :)
B000EHNEDO|5.0|I bought this DVD because I knew my son liked magical and adventurous movies like Harry Potter, so I knew he'd love the heroism and adventure in this movie!
6305428042|5.0|Cute and not to scary, this is a great movie for Halloween season!  The story is good and the cast is great!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|All the likeable characters dying is feeling a bit contrived.  The British version of the 70's show Dynasty ( but period and better acting ) needs to tame the writing a bit before it becomes a runaway train that loses coherency.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|I have always loved to read - the escape to other places, other lives has always appealed to me.  \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" is my favorite book (novella), and I've read thousands of books.  Now to get Helen Mirren to bring this to stage or screen would be my dream.  We'll never know what exactly Her Majesty thinks, but Bennett has given it a good shot, and it's totally believeable.  Combine this with Bennett's \\"A Question of Attribution\\" (best watched on YouTube clips from a BBC broadcast) and you feel that you know The Queen.
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|The movie is great. This DVD had a skip in the middle which was annoying, but the price was so low, I did not mind.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|It is bittersweet to see the Bee Gees on stage together, but you can feel the love from the audience and see the joy in the faces of the Brothers Gibb as they soak in the approval of the audience.  It is obvious they could have played all night and the audience would have stayed routed to their seats.  I wish I had been there.
0812550706|5.0|I am not a teen, but I wish I had read this when it first came out as a teen. It is being turned into a movie I understand. I will definitely go and see it.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|This version of Dredd was Awesome if you liked the original graphic novel then you will love it Extremly graphic
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Love the hidden object games, I only wish it the energy would recharged faster so could play without waiting or spending money.
B004R0V53K|4.0|This great American novel, available again in a wonderful hardcover edition is a no brainier for my library. Can' believe how long it has been--I understand it better now.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Not at all what I was expecting. There's a twist I didn't know was coming. Had me wanting to keep reading.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love it. It is very informative. It tells me what I need to know about the weather. I especially like being able to earn points for a chance to win gift cards.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|The writing is so poor I can't finish the book. I want to like it but the overuse of unnecessary descriptive words and lack of sophistication in storytelling makes me wonder if the author really cares about the art of writing. Do not waste time or money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We only just a few weeks ago started watching and trying to get up to speed so when season four starts we'll be up to date.<br />So far we gave watched both season one and two and about half of season three! We are really into it. We love it!<br /><br />Thanks for making it available on amazon!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The prediction on this keyboard is beyond compare when all the options are turned on.  And the smooth interface with the option to hold the keys down for numbers and symbols is amazing.  I really have not seen any keyboard that compares.  And for those that use Swype, SwiftKey has a &#34;swype&#34; like function (I just don't use it because of the way I like to use the keyboard).
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|There is enough detail in this book for four Ultimate Guides. I loved this and can't wait for more books. Please do one on `Heat'!
B004OZZ624|5.0|We love this movie. Perfect amount of romance and tense action. It's a must see, over and over again. :)
B00CEF014E|5.0|Whoa what a bizarrely beautiful thriller. It's like an intricate time piece with all the cogs and wheels gyrating in perfect harmony. I honestly can't think of anything similar this book - it's got a reality and quality that is truly unique. I wish it was longer. I am praying to the book gods that the author writes a sequel!!
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Its so funny so many cats that i love i liked the story i will watch it again and again
B007AR7OGE|5.0|An amazing collection of Ella Fitzgerald material, but it is, by no means complete.  Even so, if you're a fan of Ella and are missing some of the many albums in this set, it is well worth consideration.  At only a dollar per CD, you're not likely to find a better price for such a collection.  The sound quality is extremely good on most of the CDs.  The exceptions are the first threeCDs which contain material from about 1935 to 1945.  Virtually all of the tracks on thoseCDs had some level of static in the background, but was only on a few tracks that it was a bit too much in evidence.  Still, I'd Rather that the engineers stop attempting to clean up the sound when going further begins to degrade the quality of the desired material.<br /><br />The included albums are listed below.  The notations in brackets offer comments or supply the name as discovered in FreeDB or offers a US name for the album.<br /><br />1 All My Life (with additional track1, I'll Chase the Blues Away), 2 Holiday in Harlem; 3 If Dreams Come True; 4 Woe Is Me; 5 Stairway To The Stars; 6 Taking A Chance On Love; 7 Traffic Jam; 8 Sing Song Swing; 9 When My Sugar Walks Down The Street;<br /><br />10 (It`s Only A) Paper Moon [propriatary variation on Time Alone Will Tell]; 11 I`m Just A Lucky So-And-So; 12 Basin Street Blues; 13 Dream A Litt le Dream Of Me; 14 Goody Goody; 15 Crying In The Chapel; 16 Ella Sings Gershwin; 17 Songs In Mellow Mood; 18 Lullabies Of Birdland [Smooth Sailing]; 19 Careless;<br /><br />20 For Sentimental Reasons; 21 Miss Ella Fitzgerald & Mr Gordon Jenkins Invite You To Listen [I Wished On The Moon]; 22 Sweet and Hot [Moanin' Low]; 23 Swingin` Shepherd Blues Verve Singles; 24 Cole Porter Songbook CD 1; 25 Cole Porter Songbook CD2; 26 Rodgers and Hart Vol 1; 27 Rodgers and Hart Vol 2; 28 Duke Ellington Songbook Vol 1; 29 Duke Ellington Songbook Vol 2;<br /><br />30 Duke Ellington Songbook Vol 3; 31 Ella At The Opera House; 32 Like Someone In Love; 33 Billie Holiday At Newport;34 Ella Swings Lightly; 35 Irving Berlin Songbook Vol 1; 36 Irving Berlin Vol 2; 37 Get Happy!; 38 Ella Fitzgerald Sings Sweet Songs For Swingers [Out of this World]; 39 The Man I Love Gershwin Songbook Vol 1;<br /><br />40 A Foggy Day Gershwin Songbook Vol 2; 41 Mack The Knife - Ella In Berlin; 42 Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas; 43 Hello Love [You Go To My Head]; 44 From Let No Man Write My Epitaph; 45 Ella And Louis Decca [Ella And Louis]; 46 Ella & Louis [Ella And Louis]; 47 Ella And Louis Again [Ella And Louis]; 48 Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong Porgy & Bess<br /><br />Yes, the three Ella And Louis CDs appear in FreeDB with a single album name, so if you are ripping these CDS, you'll need to correct the Mp3 tags and the folder names.<br /><br />Most of these 48 CDs are included in FreeDB under the album names \\"CD ##, but those entries are flawed. The artist tag is not used.  Instead, the title tag is composed of a two digit track number, the track title, a dash and the artist.  As I ripped these CDs, I had MP3Tag running in another window.<br /><br />As soon as ripping was complete, I used MP3Tag to get the correct information from FreeDB, allowing it to construct the CD ID from the CD.  In all cases, except CD 10, it found the information for the albums under their original names.  I used that information to modify the MP3 tags from the rip and to correct the file names.<br /><br />The tracks for that missing CD 10 are:<br />01: Who Are You; 02: I'm Thrilled; 03: Make Love To Me; 04: I'm Gettin' Mighty Lonesome For You; 05: When I Come Back Crying (Will You Be Laughing At Me); 06: All I Need Is You; 07: Mama Come Home; 08: My Heart And I Decided; 09: (I Put) A Four Leaf Clover In Your Pocket; 10: He's My Guy;<br /><br />11: Cow Cow Boogie; 12: Once Too Often; 13: Time Alone Will Tell; 14: Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall; 15: I'm Making Believe; 16: And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine; 17: I'm Beginning To See The Light; 18: That's The Way It Is; 19: (It's Only A) Paper Moon; 20: (Gonna) Cry You Out Of My Heart<br /><br />I reconstructed that list from the bad FreeDB information.<br /><br />For the record, I tried two different levels of MediaMonkey to rip this set, but both only found the CD ## descriptions when ripping.  Other software may find the alternatigve descriptions and let you choose better descriptors.  MediaMonkey usually does this, but for some reason beyond me, it didn't do it for this set.
B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|I thought that the ratings given for the product were decent enough to justify buying this moderately priced mouse. I was wrong. The mouse was used in a normal environment, on a mouse pad and was never banged around at all. In the month that followed buying this product, it would occasionally lock up. At first i thought nothing of it, unplugged it, replugged it back in, worked fine. But now its to the point that it's happening every hour. I just tried to play 2 hours of gaming with some friends, during both games, i would scroll to the left of the screen and it would lock in place. I would be unable to move my mouse, my character would be stuck running in one direction, and the mouse which is usually lit was completely dark. I have had to dig out my old mouse from Asus that ive had for over 2 years previous to buying this one and use that again because this Anker mouse refuses to work properly. Be wary of buying from random brands at reasonable prices. Its quite clear they are able to sell at such a low cost due to shotty parts or manufacturing. Overall i am very displeased with this product.
0345803485|1.0|As much as I love a steamy book from time to time, I may not be able to finish this one.  In addition to the \\"Jeezes\\" and lip-biting and \\"inner goddesses,\\" their ages make it all completely unbelievable from the start.  The sex writing doesn't match the non-sex writing (what with the Jeezes and all).  Without knowing anything about the author, I guessed her age right off the bat; like me, she clearly saw Nine and a Half Weeks, Pretty Woman, Indecent Proposal, etc., and she steals from all of them.  If you're in your mid-40's, just think about those films for a minute.  I'm so annoyed that this \\"author\\" is rich, rich, rich and I'm not.  There, I said it.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I still use these headphones over a year later, and nothing is wrong with them. People hear me just fine, and the sound is ok for the price i paid. I recommend these headphones for the gamer on a budget.
B000FA675C|5.0|Layers upon layers of intrigue and puzzles.  Definitely more approachable and compelling than Inferno or Angels and Demons.  Good read.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Love the CD!  Saw the show & now can have the music anytime.  I bought 4 total. One for me & also for the others that went to the show with me!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This movie was truly enjoyable to watch.  The costumes, story line, and of course the music and characters light up the screen.<br />although it may not be as good as the book, it truly was well done.  I enjoyed this film with my 14 year old daughter who watched it<br />a second time...without any ideas pre notioned she truly attached herself to the story, and honestly we talked about the movie<br />for days after.  I don't think many of today's movies move me much, not to mention most movies are being cut short timewise,<br />leave little converstion afterwards and by no means are worth the 15 dollar ticket price, but this one in my personal opinion was<br />worth it.  The acting was done very well by leonardo Dicaprio, and he has grown into the roll very well.  My daughter ended up disliking the character of Daisy due to her selfish ways and heart made of greed...I think she really thought things out here and hopefully walked away with a new view of how money can change people not always for the better in life.  I would recommend this to others to see...it does make you stop and think when too much of anything can turn everything ugly and sour...and make people very empty, lonely, selfish, greedy and always looking for more...great material, great music and overall great cast.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|THE MOVIE IS GREAT BUT THE DISC I PURCHASED IS DAMAGED  SO THAT MAKES IT A ONE STAR. THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR WAITING TO LOOK AT THE MOVIE AFTER THE MONTH IS UP.
1781162646|5.0|GREAT book - wonderful character development, as always, by Stephen King.  A great story that I really wish was longer!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|When I miss it on TV or want to watch a particular episode, I turn to Amazon! Watch it on my tablet immediately and it's there whenever I need my fix of this witty & sophisticated show! Love it!
B00821OX98|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the show. The subject of alien invasion requires some skill to not insult viewer's intelligence and in my humble opinion Falling Skies does good job of the former and is quite entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 5 year old son loves the horse!!  The interaction is great...he really enjoys scratching him :) This is not a game he can play on his own..  I would like to find one similar that is more  for his age group
B007TKT2SK|5.0|For us fraction challenged folks you cannot beat it makes quick work of dealing with fractions this is a must have
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It is so sad Robert Jordan could not realize this incredible achievement. This story belongs in an honored place in science fiction and fantasy writing. He was truly a gifted and masterful author!  Anyone who loves epic fantasy adventure will love this collection!
B005LAIHPE|2.0|Warning - Spoilers will follow<br /><br />The movie starts off with a decent enough premise - a bunch of common sense lacking eggheads sending out a message to a planet with the potential for intelligent life, without stopping to consider the consequences.<br /><br />We then switch to a completely useless scene where we meet our hero, a loser attempting to steal a chicken burrito from a convenience store. Said loser is then forced to enlist in the Navy by his older brother (who would have made for a better lead) and, miraculously, is an officer in the chain of command next we see him. (To be an officer, he would have had to go through the Naval Academy, or, having enlisted, gone through Officer Training School.) He then goes through the rest of the movie trying to channel is inner Kirk.<br /><br />The aliens are little better. They manage to fly light years to Earth, and then have their communications ship get destroyed when hitting a satellite on their final approach. So their goal is to re-establish communications with their home world, but we do not learn this right away. First, we are left guessing at what motivates the invaders. After all, they only fire upon ships that first fired upon them. (But then they we learn that they somehow cannot \\"see\\" the ships that are not actually firing upon them - which of course is all lead up to the scene in which they are actually \\"playing\\" Battleship with the aliens by anticipating blind shots and calling out \\"hit\\" or \\"miss\\".) We find out that the conflict is not a simple misunderstanding when the main character has some sort of mind meld with an alien they just happen to find floating in the sea. He sees a vision of them conducting an all out invasion, when he looks into the aliens lizard like eyes (which is how we learn they don't like bright light, but still gives no insight as to why they cannot \\"see\\" anything not presenting an immediate threat).<br /><br />Back to their goal of getting communications established with their home world. Why is this such a concern for either side? Obviously, the aliens already know where the Earth is.  Are they not able to send more ships without the advance scouts (if that's what they are) reporting back first? And why do the main characters think that the threat is ended if the aliens cannot transfer their message? It's not like this was a random encounter. They followed the instructions given them in the beginning of the movie. Given such a situation, you cannot assume that following waves are not forthcoming.<br /><br />In the end, though it has some interesting action sequences, this movie requires a much greater suspension of disbelief than virtually all big budget alien invasion movies that have come before it. Any alien invasion movie that doesn't have the enemy simply bombard the planet from space requires suspension of disbelief, but this one simply has too many elements that are just not well thought out.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Loved the story as it is the first  time ever having read it. Always loved the movie there have been many but my favorite was filmed in 1951 with Alastair Sim as  Scrooge.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Adults and kids can enjoy this game. Hard enough to keep the adults entertained and easy enough to keep the kids occupied.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read it in just a few hours. My favorite book by far out of the three! The word limit sucks.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is very interesting, funny, and a great watch! Great cast of characters! Loved that it was available on amazon prime!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is fun to play. I would love to see more food items to feed the dragons, and less time to remove trees.
1439153663|5.0|Beautifully written pre civil war story of slavery with alternating narration and point of view, by the two main characters.
B00AG297GK|5.0|This movie was Freak'n Hilarious!!!!!  We laughed almost all the way thru.  They are requiring me to write more so there I did.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Wonderful, wistful, magical movie for all ages.  Friends have been telling me forever that I should see this movie. Now I know why. I watched it with my mom, who recently visited for a month.  We both loved it so much, and I haven't seen my mom laugh that much in a long time.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This book is pretty much what the blurb says it is: a rollicking Bond-like story about how 007 author Ian Fleming failed to negotiate the purchase of France's navy in June 1940 and along the way came up with some ideas that would later go into `Casino Royale,' `Thunderball' and `From Russia With Love.' I loved the wealth of allusions to the Bond books and the sly hijacking of history to tell what is essentially a popcorn action movie. The writing is slick and stylish and almost every chapter reads like a mini movie. Very well done. Recommended for fans of Alan Furst and Daniel Silva and, of course, Ian Fleming!
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Ok action, silly narrative, ok sets and costumes but the original was better as it was even more silly otherwise enjoty
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I am a huge Science Fiction fan!!!  So I am a huge judge on these types of books.  This book really did not let me down at all.  I felt like I was there and experiencing everything myself.  I encourage everybody to read this book.  It is GREAT!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I have this game on my home computer and was more fun and easier to follow the characters than this version on my kindle. I've tried to go back to it every so often but get frustrated with it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game. It's fun for all ages.  It continues to challenge you and there are many  to get money without actually having to spend real money.  The only thing is the good things cost allot of nuts making it hard to get them. In all very fun and entertaining.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|this angry birds episode is okay but I enjoyed the rio and seasons better, it was hard to follow each of the tasks that was required to get to the next level.
B00000DG1R|5.0|loving all their greatest hits in music of our decade and never get tired of listening to their music... it;s so awesome terrific
B004SBS8LA|4.0|rio was a fun game to play of the angry birds versions. I had fun getting thru the tasks and have gone back to try to improve my scores
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Young and old we laughed ourselves silly. The younger kids watched it twice! They want to come back to Grans house to watch it again! What more could you want from a movie?
B0058VW36U|3.0|my grandchildren downloaded this game to play but they seem to get bored with it quick. I've played a few times and and feel about the same
B0057VY45O|5.0|I came across this show by accident while looking for TV series that are included free of charge for Amazon Prime members. I must say that this is one of the best written series that I've ever had the pleasure to watch. The writing is exemplary, the plots are riveting and the acting is nothing short of superb. Labelled as a drama/comedy; I would have to say that the drama aspect comes first, but the dark humor is absolutely first rate. This show is better than just about anything I've seen on TV and I can't wait to resume watching the next season and beyond.
B001LF347E|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this first series and it was all due to Colin Morgan and his character development as he nteractis with Arthur and Gaius, especially.  The stories were wonderful, as only BBC can present them, and casting a bit of genius. -- well worth the money!!
B00BESCJII|5.0|A touching coming of age story, very well-told.  Kudos to the writer, the director, and the young cast.  Highly recommended.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Some music is on her other albums but still wonderful to listen to.  I am a big fan of hers and love anything she puts forth.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I actually thought this was a very good movie. For those who aren't familiar with the franchise, it introduced everyone brilliantly and for open minded fans it gives a cool twist. But if you are a hard core trekkie you may not be as happy with this. All in all I recommend this movie.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Heard about him on 60 minutes, so ordered his CD.  What great music--reminds me of Bob Dylan.  His songs all have a message.  worth buying if you like kind of bluesy rock music.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy works I have read in years. The plot is fresh, the character development is strong and you feel the world building.
B000000I3O|5.0|I rediscovered punk.  I almost forgot how awesome this music is.  This stuff is when Glen Danzig used to be cool.  LOL!
B000HL09SA|5.0|I think that everyone growing up with a special dog has a Skip story to tell...a feel good tearjerker which was just what I needed!
B000005IU1|5.0|Iggy Pop is a god!  I can't stop listening to &#34;I Wanna Be Your Dog.&#34;  Every cover of it doesn't do the original justice!
B000006NUW|5.0|This is an excellent collection! We recently visited Hitsville USA in Detroit and to think that so many of these iconic sounds came from  this unassuming building on West Grand Boulevard made having them assembled in one collection all the more enjoyable!
1476729719|5.0|It  had a good message for all young people.  I recommended it to my son as a must read for his high school freshman English class.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is a little challenging, but tons of fun for teenage readers. I would definitely recommend this book to readers 12 and older.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My great-niece who just turned 3 loved it and said she wants to be a Mermaid just like in the movie.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I am all for paying an acceptable amount of money for an entertaining app, but this app and Amazon scammed my 9 year old out of 70 dollars for very little in return.  Unfortunately, my 9 year old daughter was not aware of the fine print when she purchased some small add ons for the game and was left with a 70 dollar bill.  While I do believe this is my responsibility as well as I did not monitor her enough for a few hours, I believe this game scams young children and would be careful about supporting this app.  LOOK AT OTHER REVIEWERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE.  Beware of this scam.
B00371XIJE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but it made me ball my eyes out.  I recommend it, just be prepared to cry if you are a crier.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Excellent rendition of a classic! Leonardo Dicaprio nails the role of Gatsby and brings this ageless classic to life. Additionally I am a fan of the director Baz Lurhmann and love how he captures the craziness, vibrance and wildness of the roaring twenties! In my opinion, this was a book that was made for his unique talent of making a film become three dimentional in its color, music and landscape! Highly recommend this movie!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I don't mind free apps with ads, but I don't like ads in paid apps. Also auto start in the background. I chose to uninstall.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It is awesome to be able to get to photos on the Cloud!<br />Since I have not purchased the Newer HD .<br />.this allows my to at least see photos and show them to others...
B005M5PENG|5.0|This is a great show! I would definitely recommend it to people who watch crime shows. It has interesting characters and a good plot that is easy to follow.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|... it is directed by korean director kim jee woon who has a great record of making exciting movies.<br /><br />tired old plot. arnie looks like an ancient decommissioned terminator robot. but the highly talented kim jee woon breathes new life into all this and comes up with a stylish and (almost) riveting thriller.<br /><br />if it were not for kim and some standard american director was at the helm, i doubt if the movie would have been half as exciting.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|When I first got my Kindle Fire for Mother's Day 2012 my son got the Grey/Black one-- It was so great that I saw Amazon selling them for 9.99 and I bought 4 new colors.  This green is great -- I carry it everyday in my pocketbook and the protection if just FAB!!!
B00AFEX83C|5.0|My toddler loves this movie! It starts out a little scary for her, but then quickly turns funny. Another great movie from Disney/Pixar.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you're into your whiteness or blackness this is probably not the movie for you. If your German, you might appreciate it. This is a hard hitting movie about the depravities of power and arrogance during slavery's heyday. It has plenty of blood for you Quentin Tarantino fans, and it has hero's and villains for.all you action adventure fans.<br /><br />The only downside is that you might have a hard time living with yourself after you've watched a portrayal of slavery at its worst...at least I hope it's the worst. You can't help but like the two main characters, and hate the primary villain,but after the movie I began to wonder how evil some plantation owners might have been. Give a man that much power over other people and you're bound to have some who will abuse men and women without mercy.<br /><br />I liked the movie, but I fear its truth.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|If you, like many TNG fans, are interested in learning about Data and the whole AI part of TNG, this book is for you. It starts pretty slow but once it gets going it is very interesting. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I'll just leave it at that.
B00008AY3L|5.0|this is one fantastic album, in my opinion, some of ben harpers best stuff, you will enjoy this album for sure!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This film was a lot of fun, romantic and very compelling. A great interpretation of the novel. The chemistry between the actors was very good. The performances were excellent, particularly that of Toby McGuire.<br /><br />Jennifer Leigh Wells<br />Author of Knight of the Purple Ribbon
B00A81MV3U|1.0|I am just stunned that this movie has so many positive reviews, wow! I watched it and thought it sucked. It was very boring and the movie had no flow what so ever. The positive reviews are once again, stunning.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's extremely convenient - can check on the weather any time!!<br /><br />LOVE IT - LOVE IT - LOVE IT - (Just FYI.....it's a real pain REQUIRING a certain number of words for the comment)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I'm having fun in the game. Wish there were more battles. Just got started playing but it does kill some time. Fun.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|At long last someone has written the story of Ian Fleming's role in World War 2.  I've always wondered why no one has done a movie about the man who created James Bond. Ian Fleming's Wikipedia entry has been growing lately as more and more information becomes declassified so I guess it was only a matter of time. Kudos to Damian Stevenson to crafting a detailed, thoroughly researched narrative to do Mr. Fleming's life story the intelligent literary treatment it deserves. Stevenson writes like a budding Alan Furst or Daniel Silva. I am excited to read `Operation Parsifal' when it hits stores!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think we need a few updates on the game but my horse is cute and I only need 7 more medals for vectors horse
B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight club 10th anniversary blu-ray edition brings you the movie you love with better blood, better bruises and better fist to face clarity.  Everything you love about fight club is here and enhanced to pure awesomeness.  Everything about this item is better from the case to the title screen and cut outs.  This is a need to have for all movie collections.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Found game to very enjoyable and would recommend to friends . A very simple way to relax and have some fun. Can't wait for next level every time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I buy few books at retail e-book price, but this one was a must-read. As an avid amateur student of history, I found Dr. Aslam's book a vivid, fascinating description of the life and times of a person around whom so much myth and legend has grown, and around whose life and teachings a major world religion has blossomed. The author's impressive scholarly credentials come through very well here, yet his writing is direct, straightforward, and aimed at the non-scholarly world. His conclusions are well-documented and rational, as is his painting of the society, culture, and politics of Jesus' world, and the events surrounding his disciples after Jesus' death. The author also lends insight into the puzzling question regarding how religious movements take root and grow, first regionally, and then internationally.<br />For anyone interested in the historical Jesus stripped of mythology and legend, I highly recommend this book.
1594744475|5.0|i never knew there was so many ways to make lunches so cute the steps were easy to follow and the kids love it
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a great book.  Until I read this I had no idea that this was going on in our country.  I consider myself somewhat of a history buff but never had I heard of anything like this.  How sad and scary it must have been for these poor kids.<br />Kline did a great job right from page one connecting you to the characters and the story behind each of them. Excellent read, this one is a re-read!
B008M721MS|3.0|It likely to occur a error like that: when I log in my account on skype( use kindle fire hd 7). If i log out then I can not log in again. I thought may be i forgot my password. But I have tried to recover my password and then try log in. But it still doesn't work!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A good time killer.  Easy to get upgrades and advance through the game.  Lots of fun to play.  Even my wife to play.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|But it shoud be improved more. More brushes, more effect (ex color mixing ). Thank programmers who have made this application!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Incredible photography! Not only is the subject matter fascinating but time and again I found myself marveling at the ingenuity and dedication required to do the filming. Of course, David Attenborough's narration is icing on the cake with BBC Orchestra music the sprinkles.
B000I5X824|5.0|I love these guys and this album has almost every great song of theirs, I can listen to every single song
B005XQLBU4|4.0|If you like the old Missile Command type of games then this is for you! Plays great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can say for all my days of during a kindle this is my favorite I recommend for anyone who loves horses.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Sounds is amazing. How wonderful to have all of these materials in one unique presentation. If you love Paul or The Beatles, it's a must.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Simple to use and good enough for utility blades. This has made it easier to sharpen my curved blades while in the field.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|What can you say about Ringo Starr? Fantastic musician that always provides a great show with his many versions of the All Starr Band. A must have.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Very good entertainment when you're in waiting rooms, airport terminals and etc. A well done app. I look forward to putting out some fires during my next detainment.
B00DXP0QX0|2.0|Two interesting versions of Maggie May, and a whole lot of drivel.  At this point, I should have known that Rod had fully mined his back catalog.  There's nothing to see here.  Move along.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I could not get past level 4 in this game before the app suggested I make an in app purchase of &#34;superpowers&#34;. What a shame! Amazon is giving this away as a great FREE game. Nothing FREE about it.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|I guess I was expecting more of an Oceans Eleven with magic but that's not really what this movie is.  I don't like to give away spoilers so I won't get into specifics but this is one of the few movies that I can honestly say surprised me at the very end.  The special effects were believable and entertaining.  Great job with the casting with the exception of Jesse Eisenberg, I think he is a wonderful actor but I would have thought that his role would've been more along the lines of Zac Efron, Logan Lerman or maybe even Tom Felton.  Not that Eisenberg didn't do a great job, the look of the character just didn't seem to &#34;fit&#34; him.  All in all, I'm glad that this was a purchase rather than a rental because I will definitely watch it again.
159514188X|5.0|Love love love this book. Lost my first copy so I had to buy another one. Only took me a day to read because I was so hooked
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|I was looking forward to watching this and comparing it to the original from 1981.  Of course the special effects were much better this time around and maybe I just don't remember the details of the original but this  version seemed to have an overabundance of blood and guts and gore.  It was a good movie with an engaging plot and wonderful casting but probably could have done without at least SOME of the gore.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Somebody who is into the zombie fiction recommended this read to me.  I didn't expect the format.  Still it was an entertaining read.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I'm glad I only rented rather than purchased this movie - I don't think I would watch it again.  I have the book but have never read it.  I am (shamefully, at my age) a fan of the Twilight Saga books by Stephenie Meyer as well as the movie adaptations so I thought I would give The Host a try.  The general premise is a solid one (alien takeover through mind/body &#34;invasion&#34;) but I guess it was just too much teen-angst-love-story for me.  Not that there isn't plenty of that in the Twilight Saga but that series has enough action and intrigue to balance it out.  Not enough of an edge to keep me engaged and the end was quite predictable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great! And I can't wait until the next season starts. I hope Matthew doesn't die. That would be so very sad.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As with a good book, we could not put it down.  We had one defective disc and couldn't wait to watch those episodes until the exchange came through, so we tuned in to the free cloud video.  The entire series is wonderfully filmed and cast, and every historical detail is painstakingly correct.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved it before they changed it. Wish I could have chosen to upgrade or not. Now I find it not interesting.
1883010039|5.0|would recommend this book to everyone from the starter to the experienced!!! Learn to weave, and I did, Thank you
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I love this movie and it is a favorite.  My son and I watched it together and we can really relate!  Very funny and entertaining.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the neatest gadgets out there, I think everyone should have one. It works well with all my computers
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This is a great TV show. Katharine McPhee is amazing in it. I would recommend to anyone who watches TV.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Was first hooked by the show and had to check out the book. Was attracted to the story because I was a crazy teenager and in my 20's. Now I am a law abiding, tax paying citizen.  I could see how your past mistakes can easily haunt your future.<br />**spoilers** The show seemed much darker than her experience in the book. Which I feel takes away from her point. The women jail correctional system is not just about fighting,sex, being rapped and racism. There were a lot of sister /mother relationships. That a crime like hers would have been better served working with drug attacks instead of sitting in a cell wasting tax payers money. I was a little disappointed she did not write a chapter on life after jail. Otherwise, a great quick read. Gives you a little more insight on her experience.
0786888628|5.0|I was looking for a book on the Korean War that would tell me how and why the United States got involved and how the war was prosecuted.  I wanted to know both the domestic and international politics of both fighting parties.  I also wanted to know the military strategy of all the waring parties.  The book did give some details on some of the significant battles, some first-person battle accounts, but what this book really delivers is more of a big picture of events.  This book in fact did answer my questions on the Korean War.  I highly recommend this book if you are trying to understand the Korean War, what went right and what went wrong.
B008GM1FPI|5.0|By far my second favorite from Linklater. In my review for Slacker, I described it as a film defining life itself. This film is very similar to Slacker excepts it focuses on one theme, and that is how life can be a dream. The rotoscope animation really does visual wonders for a very unsettling, yet vibrant picture as this. It's a film some would appreciate if you have the meaning of life on your mind. One thing I've noticed about this film is how uncomfortable it can feel. The character that Wiley Wiggins plays is probably himself. Very mellow and troubled. You'll find others who feel the need to skip the world because they all are going to die anyway. So, if your in the mood for a jazzy, unexpected, and thought provoking film, Richard Linklater's Waking Life is for you. It deserves to be marked as one of the first films of it's time to present life in this form.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I love how Tom Hanks makes this film work. Without him this would not work.<br />The Director maintained great pacing.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|it was nice to see Barbara Streisand in a funny movie again. Nice and light feel good movie. She still has it.
0385535139|5.0|Grisham books always captivate me so that I cannot put them down until I finish!!  His mind is a bottomless pit!
B005LAII4E|4.0|I really liked the movie.  However, it would have been better if Channing Tatum had not been killed off so soon after the movie started.  That means he can not be in any future GI JOE movies.  ARGH!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great cast, script, and wonderful british humor and drama!  wonderful set with attention to detail that most will appreciate! Fabulous!
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Great album... not one song I dont like... I am a big fan of bass and every song on this album sounds amazing pumpin through my subs
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Oh. My. Gawd.<br /><br />Normally with cover tunes, I always end up wishing the band left well enough alone -- the originals are usually SO much better. Not so with Adrenaline Mob.<br /><br />This album absolutely ROCKS. I'm stunned at how tightly these guys have nailed these cover tunes and completely taken them over as their own. All the members play like musicial chameleons, seamlessly switching from such a spot-on \\"Stand Up and Shout\\" and \\"Kill the King\\" that I swear they borrowed Ronnie James, to a shockingly soulful rendition of Zep's \\"Lemon Song\\" complete with John Moyer's faithful and skillful rendition of the famous bass line. And this remains the only band, male or female, that I've ever heard doing a version of Heart's Barracuda that stood up to the original. And while I'm a huge prog fan, you won't find any here: All of these songs are raw rock & roll at it's bloody best.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Loved it and is a very different sound from the usual stuff John MAyer puts out, def more folk in this.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love this calendar app!  It displays enough information in the month view so that you can view your schedule easily.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|My 11 year old loves this movie, so I rated it based on her opinion.  They did give the heroine some self motivation and a more active role.  Of course she's a naive, impressionable blonde with cleavage who likes shiny things and falls for the first amoral idiot she meets.  So glad for the positive messages.  Yay.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I enjoyed Jack the Giant Slayer.  It was like many others described - fun for kids, but a lot of computer graphics that were obvious.  It is a decent retelling of an old story, so that part was enjoyable.
1400052181|5.0|Incredible how a violation of a persons rights by today's standards led to sooo many great discoveries and overall progression of science.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|it is awesome I can see myself playing it 24/7 I love it just like gta4 its also fun too just watch somebody play it its tottally addicting
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really moved me.. And I don't really like books but.. I guess I like reading now because of this book, so cool :)
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Great mix of action and comedy - I look forward to seeing RED 2 and I hope that it is available on Amazon Prime!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|The Goonies is one of those movies everyone saw as a child. We grew up quoting it, doing the truffle shuffle, and wishing we would stumble upon a lost treasure map. I highly recommend this movie for parents and kids. Its filled with adventure and many jokes that will go over your kids head but will crack you up.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Just ok movie...disappointing ending...not worth rental really. Ending was not great. disappointing overall. not recommend. look else ware  bye now
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It a pretty awesome game I like it it's about horses you could get tired of it it takes up some time lol kinda like a real one so have fun sometimes I do and I don't know what fun is anyway hahaha lol I. Jus kidding. Well I'm off this thing.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|The plot and the story behind the stories, the suspense, and the waiting for the next book just show, that Jeffrey Archer remains a story teller who is hard to beat most enjoyable reading with an in depth historical view of old England and the English way of living .
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great game. Need to try it. I play this type of game pretty regular and its pretty kool. Get the app now and try it...You will like it.
B00989ZX8I|5.0|As a diver, I found this extremely cool (especially on a 3D TV).  I watched this with my daughter on our 3D TV and she loved it too so much that we watched it twice.  The next morning when she awoke, she asked me to play it again.  I was very happy to accommodate her as she had many &#34;movies&#34; from which to choose but this was her #1 choice!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is great. Easy intuitive controls. No need to purchase in game currency Although I am sure it would help if your into that. Fun Maps and great selection of vehicles.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Unfortunately, a movie can never live up to the book; Michael Connelly being one of my favorite authors.  McConaughey portrays the smart aleck lawyer character well.
B0094M30I4|5.0|Great acting with a ton of eye candy great for the whole family! Beautiful sets and great CGI. Lots of color to make the movie pop off the screen.
B00634GHJA|5.0|this app works great.  I can put the camera pictures on both my mac and my pc and I can also upload to the camera and then download to the other computer.  LOVE IT!
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|It's a pretty good game! Definitely worth buying it! Only cons are 1.you can't change the body 2. 2nd upgrade cost a little bit to much. But very good!
0751517089|3.0|Some passages have lot of not worthed details about his life, in the other hand a good look to the mind of a bribe
0767817664|4.0|This film won a Saturn Award, received a sequel and got a remake (and it looks like a direct-to-video sequel for the remake is in the works). My only complaint is that the extras are light on this DVD. A deluxe Blu-ray with 3 hours of bonus content would be a worthy addition to your library. Fright Night is stuck on DVD for now. It was released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time but went out of print Dec/2011. It does have a multi-region Blu-ray that can be imported.
B000V39KDO|5.0|This movie flippin rocks!  The CG is awesome like comic book pages coming alive.  War in watercolor.  Imagine Gerard Butler yelling Molon Labe!
B0053FANS6|2.0|You get The Mummy Trilogy on 3 discs in this set (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Tomb of the Dragon Emperor). All three films star Brendan Fraser but the original is the strongest by far. This trilogy is so much fun because it has a Raiders of the Lost Ark feel. Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio is even better. The real problem is that there is roughly 3 hours of total bonus content but they are fairly bland and mostly identical to the DVD supplements. The franchise really needs a decent 3-hour making of documentary. The DVD Trilogy was a 4 star release at the time but more is expected for Blu-ray. These are 4 star films in a 2 star package. Fans who already own the DVD or Blu-ray stand-alone releases may not want to purchase this package.
1400052173|5.0|I was fascinated to read about Mrs. Lacks and her family after seeing their story on an African American website. Mrs. Lacks no doubt has saved countless lives and led to medical breakthroughs. It was wrong the way that she and her family were treated; however, if this had not happened; medical science would not be what it is today. Johns Hopkins needs to do right by this family as well as every laboratory that benefited from the use of HeLa cells. I applaud Deborah's quest to find out the truth regarding her mother. She was a strong woman. I also applaud Rebecca Skloot's for uncovering the truth and writing this book. It is truly great African American history.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|Labyrinth is an original work featuring a young girl who must traverse a maze to retrieve her baby brother who has been captured by the goblin king.

0812993845|5.0|Awesome book, love this author she always makes me laugh. Wedding night is a classic Sophie kinsella novel, definitely worth buying.
B003NS1JHY|4.0|This was not what I expected. I thought it would be more like the old TV series, which I remember as being a lot more humorous It was somewhat entertaining, but violent. No swearing or overt sex.
B005PK56TA|4.0|A Refreshingly unique, well scripted, plot with great actors.  Lots of twists along the way. Look forward to season two.
B008KPDYQY|3.0|There are a lot of really funny bits in this movie and a cast full of funny performances. That said, I think a good 30 minutes worth of scenes that go on too long or go nowhere special would have made it better.
0345803485|1.0|This book is nothing to rave about. I can't believe I bought into the hype (*eye roll*).<br /><br />It was interesting at first, but became real boring FAST. Anyone who thinks this is hot and a masterpiece has a screw loose and completely deprived.<br /><br />The story line and title had potential (especially the title). However, the writing was shoddy and the characters lack depth. The first half of the book was okay, but  getting through the rest was almost impossible. I had to stop reading it for a few weeks because the female lead was getting more and more annoying with every turn of the page. The worst thing about the book is that it's so redundant/repetitive to the point of feeling like the author is doing this just to annoy the reader. Words you will see over and over and over and over again:  lip biting, \\"Oh my!\\", \\"eat\\", \\"Holy sh-\\", \\"Holy f-\\".<br /><br />*Spoiler alert*<br /><br />Synopsis of the book: college girl with low self esteem meets incredibly handsome rich young guy who finds that she's special in some way - though the reader will never see it; when they finally hook up, she finds out he is a sexual deviant - but she sticks around to find out how deviant; they do it like rabbits because they're both horn dogs; she's always biting her lip and he's always commanding her to eat (she's got to be all skin and bones); girl gets jealous of guy's past female bedfellows; they take a break.<br /><br />I thought Fifty Shades would be comparable to Harlequins romance. What a big fat disappointment! Too bad I bought the set. Now I have to go to Book 2. I hope it gets better.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Even after almost nine decades, F. W. Murnau's film remains a classic of horror cinema.  The film contains some genuinely shocking moments, especially when Hutter (Gustav v. Wangenheim) comes to visit Graf Orlok (aka Nosferatu's) lair.  Played by Max Schreck, Nosferatu is a genuinely creepy monster; with adept use of - at that time radical - cinematic techniques, director Murnau shows how he can reappear and disappear at will.  No one appears to be able to resist him; his demise at the end of the film is mostly due to hubris - the belief that he is somehow indestructible.  MOSFERATU also contains some memorable images: the rats moving in and around Nosferatu's coffin; the plague-ridden street, with coffins coming out of various doors; the lonely dog-cart moving slowly across a desolate landscape towards Nosferatu's castle.  The version I saw had been recently restores (2010), with a new score and the original German title-cards (with English translations).  Happily enough, the translations do not attempt to popularize the film by renaming Nosferatu Dracula.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I need to know what happens next! A read that will keep you obsessed. Definitely recommend to 50 shades fans
034552554X|5.0|Beautifully written. I love flowers all the more. They have more meaning to me know. I thought for the authors first book she did an amazing job.
B008XGW1CI|3.0|This book seemed like J.K. Rowling was trying too hard to write for adults. The book is about a town no one would want to live in and all the messed up people who live there. Apparently the one &#34;good&#34; person has died creating the Casual Vacancy on the town board which causes everyone's secrets to be exposed. Not something I would recommend reading.
0425166805|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to put down. I recommend it to anyone who thinks they may be interested.<br /><br />Cons: The photos were black and white. They were not of good quality. (but you can always look stuff up online and see it, when you know what you are looking for)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|theater quality w/viera t.v. and active glasses. amazing! good for a &#34;message&#34;movie and 3d is pretty cool for our family.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this app only has certain levels, not all of them<br />i found it useless do not buy this app at all
B003NS1JHY|5.0|This movie had a lot of fun kick butt action in it, and beautiful women. It wasn't too long, neither was it too short. The actors were great Will Smith was comedic, charming and cool, while Kevin Kline was genius and thoughtful. Salma Hyack was elegant and sexy. The best compliment for a cowboy shooter. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was a great show.
B0073V7YTY|2.0|I opened this App as I wanted to get some idea of the noise level of a rather large bar near to my home.<br /><br />I was unable to pick on my precise phone as the choice is rather limited. Consequently it may well be working fine but the calibration is way off.<br /><br />I am unable to get a reading below 60dB even in a totally quiet room. If I breathe out  gently near the microphone it records around 82dB which is listed as a busy street or an alarm clock. A good idea if I could calibrate it to my phone.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game....I can't put it down! Neither can my kids or my wife! SO Addicting and fun. Would def. recommend.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Beautiful clean UI, pleasant music, easy to understand, fun to operate.<br />Tip: when you have no more moves, tap to reshuffle left over pieces.
140006922X|5.0|While what might be called the plot line breezes along (as one might expect from a professor of creative writing), the extensive discussion of important points in the notes (especially where others differ from the author's conclusions) makes this book quite convincing.  Despite what some so=called pundits have said, he does provide support for what might be called the central tenet of Christianity.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's rather hard to aim and time my missiles correctly and accurately.<br />Bombs come too fast that I cannot react in time.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Not that this movie needs another 5 star review, but ok yes, it's a great movie.  I'm not going to explain why.  Just watch it and you'll see why.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Great series Kevin Spacey is wonderful in this netflix series..I am only on my 6th episode and can't wait to see the rest!! looking forward to Season 2 of House of cards
B00AYF5SRG|5.0|I was extremely pleased with this recording and the solo violinist Giuliano Carmignola.  This music of Vivaldi's is not as well-known as most of his works.  I was taken with the music and also the violinist's performance as well as the Academia Bizantina.  The group works exceeding well together - it is one of the best groups I have ever heard.  As a former professional violinist I was enchanted with Mr. Carmignola's musical renditions and his wonderful exacting technique.  A very sensitive, musical performance - he is one of the best violinists I have ever heard play Vivaldi.  He knows exactly what to do in tonal shading and emotion to bring out the best in Vivaldi - I am sure Vivaldi would have been pleased with Mr. Carmignola's rendition which I feel is as close as possible to the original scores.  The Academia Bizantina is a wonderfully sensitive group, balancing the violinist's performance extremely well.  The recording itself is very good - the highs and lows come across well on my Bose.  I cannot say enough about this cd - I will be listening to this many times and am interested in purchasing more cd's by Academia Bizantina and performances by the fabulous violinist Giuliano Carmignola.  I highly recommend the purchase of this cd - listening to it will be an enjoyable experience.
B002XXPNXG|1.0|Hawke and Delpy are both attractive people.  Their interplay in this movie lacked everything that makes me want to watch a movie.  It was awful.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Okay, I'm not sure if it's just me, but when I'm scrolling through my newsfeed and there's 10+ status updates, it never lets me like/comment on pictures or status'. Like, there's a bar at the top saying how much updates from other people and once that comes up I have to click on it to like or comment on something. It's seriously frustrating.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|I gave this movie one star because I didn't like it.  Here's why. Movie makers these days have made movies from Graphic Novels.  Baz Luhrman makes a Graphic Novel out of a movie.  His energetic CGI infused style works in some cases but not in all. In my opinion, it didn't work for Gatsby.  The hot, hazy, at times, sultry summer was depicted as a sharp, clear constant party wherein the characters were lost.  Perhaps it's the clarity of CGI and High Def that turned me off.  But the casting didn't seem to fit as well.  I think Leonardo DiCaprio is a terrific actor and I love most of his films.  But this one...not so much.  He looked and sounded very uncomfortable when ending his sentences with the signature words \\"old sport\\".  I cringed with each utterance.  The words didn't seem natural for him.  I'm not a fan of Tobey Macguire and don't understand Hollywoods fascination with him.  I didn't even like him in Spiderman. But again, just my opinion.  The rest of the cast, as far as I'm concerned, were forgettable.  The 1974 Robert Redford film, while not the best of movies, was much better than this one.  Except for Bruce Dern, the cast fit easily into the 20's era. Finally, some movie remakes should not be made.  Time to leave this one alone and move on to a fresh original story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Wow it's great. This is the most trendy game today.I think there is no other game better than this . This is the greatest mean of pass time. I recommend you to play this game.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|If you have been collecting Dylan's studio albums, you could argue that there's no need to hear this batch of alternates and unreleased takes from sessions around 1969-71, but ask yourself -- suppose you had had a chance to sit in and listen to these songs being tried out.  How many of you would say, \\"No thanks, I'll wait for the finished disc\\"?  Unless you would say that, you should feel alright about getting this.  The sound is good, the settings are (for the most part) spare, and Bob is in fine voice, often singing with a directness and a tonal allure that sometimes disappears in the personae on the finished products.  Here too we hear some of the beauty of the lower part of his voice, which I don't usually associate with his production.  I enjoy hearing again the balladeer -- \\"Pretty Saro,\\" \\"Spanish is the loving tongue,\\" \\"Thirsty Roots,\\" \\"Days of '49\\" are all well done.  \\"Annie's going to sing her song\\" is very funny, and the odd \\"Tattle O'Day\\" is a charmer.  But it's good too to hear the one or two standards: \\"When I paint my masterpiece\\" with Bob self-accompanying on the piano, is nice, and from a live concert with the Band on the Isle of Wight are \\"I'll be your Baby Tonight\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" and both come across well.  The accompanying booklet has all the details of the accompanying musicians, as well as the dates.  It also has an essay by Griel Marcus which doesn't exactly take back his negative response to the original \\"Self Portrait\\" but which gives individual songs here the dignity of attention.  It all sounds good, and while it's not an album that you absolutely have to have (if you have the songs on other albums), it's good to hear a great artist trying stuff out, especially when the stuff itself is fine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the best games ever when I first found out about minecraft I was immediately hooked in creative u get to do whatever u want in survival u have to survive from all the monsters but don't worry there's a peaceful mode.  It has come a long way since it first came out. If u like this version buy the xbox and computer version.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I love everything about this trilogy so far - the story and the writing are amazing.  I can't wait for the final book to come out.
1781162646|5.0|This is old school cool, and a soon to be classic by one of the best of our time, King has out done himself on this book!!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Everyone is unsure of the main character or the hatred aimed towards this film. It was a great movie and provoked some thought. Is there anything wrong with that?
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Funny enough, this book was given to me as a gift by a high ranking male executive where I work - he said he thought of me when he read it.  For whatever reason, I put off reading it a few months (I'm kind of limited on time with a demanding full time job, plus small children at home, etc. and opted for other types of books to read during my spare time), even though I'm a pretty avid reader.  As time passed, it was recommended to me by other male colleagues that I would never have imagined would have read it or cared enough to mention it to me.  So, I read it and was amazed at how close to home this book hit me.  It was not only full of personal experiences that have universal appeal for any overachieving working professional, it was backed by thoughtful research that support a woman who wants to have it all.  Sheryl managed to keep it real, and cover some serious topics with humor and honesty.  I have recommended this book to every woman I know.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Hosseini proves talent, this is a beautifully written book with multiple stories touching upon several cultures. I can't wait for the next book!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|From the minute I picked up this book I was mesmerized by all that was going on in the lives of these people.  Each character is someone in our own lives whether close to us or a family member who moved away.  I know a Tess and a Celine and probably a Felicity too.  Of course all their moms are our friends mothers too.<br /><br />Indulge yourself for 2 days of reading!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|BEST SHOW EVER, ALL THE ACTORS A PERFECT FIT IN THIS SHOW, BUT ONE THING THAT IS  UPSETTING IS THAT  ZIVA IS  LEAVING,  THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET SOMEONE REALLY BIG TO FILL HER SHOES, WHY CAN'T THEY  GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS, WHEN SHE FIRST CAME ON THE SHOW IT INSTANTLY BECAME A FAMILY, A PERFECT FIT. VERY SAID.

0345525558|3.0|The book started slow, I almost stopped reading after the first couple of chapters, but it got better.  At some point I was waiting for Victoria to drop the attitude.  Most of her problems were self-inflicted.  The part that really got on my nerves was the whole breastfeeding scenario. Now really - a new mom can not go almost 36 hours with no food, barely any sleep, while breastfeeding the entire 36 hours....very unrealistic. And like any woman would let their baby nurse off of nipples bleeding so bad that they had to wipe the blood off of the baby's lips...seriously - at that point it's time to try something new.  Overall the book was OK!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the BEST books I have read in awhile.  It's one of those books you think about all day at work and can't wait to come home to and read.  Hugh Howey has moved up to one of my favorite authors. Looking forward to his next installment of this series.
B00000D9TQ|1.0|The tape skiips something terrible.  In fact it's just as bad as my 8 year old tape.  I would like to return it but I cannot remember from whom I purchased it.<br /><br />Thumps down.
B007L5LD9O|4.0|Great adaptation of the book. The ending could have finished a little better, though.  The characters were cased very well.
0525478817|5.0|When I first read the reviews for this book I was expecting a non stop water works fest. John green is an excellent writer having just finished looking for Alaska I was excited to read more of his work.  The fault in our stars is very touching, but written in a way that is realistic and not just depressing. It's an excellent read and you can't help but feeling grateful for being alive after reading it
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great playing with people on line.  Just like playing at table setting. Wish you get more free coins more once a day.
1439170045|5.0|I read the book during a time period I was in contact with a relative with Alzheimer's disease and I was so much affected by this book that I was living in Allice's world for a while. The author has done a terrific job describing the story form Allice's perception of the world around and still managed to provide the reader with a lot of valuable and easy to understand information about the disease. Great read!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan has written a scholarly book examining Jesus of Nazareth, the man,and the enormous impact he has had on the lives of billions of people, knowingly and unknowingly.  Fifty years ago, I asked my mother, a scholar of ancient Greek and Latin what was actually known comtemporaneously about Jesus. She replied, \\"very little\\".  Fifty years later, Aslan confirms her assessment.  Nevertheless through an exhaustive study of ancient and modern texts, he puts together a compelling portrait of this remarkable man.  He separates Jesus the man from Jesus, the pillar of Christianity without being dismissive of anyone's beliefs or promoting any agenda.  In a required reading of the endnotes, he presents all the scholars who agree and disagree with him.  We should not be afraid to examine history; faith is in an entirely different realm, it exists and thrives on its own and cannot be threatened by honest inquiry and discussion.  Reza Aslan's book on the Muslim world, \\"No God But God\\" informed an entire generation of Westerners who knew nothing about one of the major religions of the world and the source of centuries of conflict, which will affect our lives for centuries to come.  Knowledge is power - I welcome any and all legitimate searchers, whether they support my views or not.  They still empower me!
B00013F35I|4.0|Would definitely recommend to any Bruce Springsteen fan.  It is the only video recorded concert that Springsteen has done, and he doesn't disappoint. Even though the sound seems a little muffled at time, it doesn't take away too much from the experience.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I usually disdain all of the &#34;relaunches&#34; Hollywood does but this is OK. With the apparent like of any original storytelling in Hollywood at least they are remaking a genre of movie I like. Nobody is going to beat the original but this is a fun popcorn movie.

B00DGNOMB6|5.0|The movies that address the concerns and realities of aging and doing it with great aplomb give me hope for this the last third of my life.  This was a pleasant journey into the choices that I may have to deal with in the years ahead.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|I remember being...bemused...when the original Self Portrait came out.  It was definitely not what I (or most of the rock critics) expected...some of it I really liked, and some of it seemed a bit...lost.  I actually felt sorry for the artist, particularly when the reviewers all but accused him of cultural betrayal--and responsibility, somehow, for the Nixon years, to boot!  Over the time, an odd thing happened--this record, like an old flannel shirt or pair of jeans--became a favorite to listen to when I was doing a carpentry project or canning vegetables--or putting my kids to bed on a hot summer night--\\"OK--if you're quiet, I'll put on \\"Tired Horses\\"--by \\"Alberta #2\\" they'd be fast asleep.<br /><br />This new issue of Another Self Portrait is a great perspective on American music, on our collective and individual attempts to grasp, embrace, survive, and pass along our culture.  I happen to have been a fan of the Isle of Wight concert from old bootlegs, and this new issue is masterfully produced--Dylan and The Band making great music.<br /><br />The irony here is that this artist never sang sweeter or more melodically--he didn't want to as a young man, and, now, as an old man, he cannot.  So here he is, not the Son Of Guthrie, nor the Conscience of a Generation, not the Acid King, not even the Poet Laureate of the last 100 Years.  He's just the guy on the Nashville Skyline cover, tipping his hat, holding on to a big old Gibson Hummingbird and saying hello.  And that's just fine by me.  Great to see you; great to have you, even in a complicated way, as a friend.
B001A5HBAG|3.0|I watched this series because a good number of my friends told me that I should see it and that is what I did.  I feel that in order to have a better reaction to the series I need to view a few more.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My sister introduced me to this game when she got her iPad, and I love it. Each level presents a fun challenge, and it's very entertaining.
B0042ESTQW|4.0|This case is very good product except only one thing.<br /><br />It looks dust friendly product.<br /><br />I recommend this product to somebody who does not care dust.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I purchased this stroller organizer with the intention of using it on our future trip to WDW, but I find myself using it with our single stroller a Contours-Lite since it only came with a removable cup holder.  I love this organizer because it holds so much! I can keep a sippy cup, a can of soda, my keys and my cell phone all in the compartments at one time.  I usually keep a small lysol wipes in there as well to clean tables and door handles as needed.  This is easy on and off, so if you have multiple strollers you can switch between strollers often, very easily. We plan to use this with our stroller rental (Citi Mini Double) when we travel to Disney World fall of 2014. You can use it on one side of the double.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Probably one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend this to boys and girls 8-100!!!!!!<br />Very good book
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very good APP to have. You can set it for your home town and every time you pull it up, you have a five day forecast at your finger tips. If you are traveling, just change the city to any city you with and get the weather there. I use this almost daily..
B009CQMZ6K|2.0|The product was just perfect for about 2 weeks and after that the suction device fell appart and now is unusable.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Storyline got too unrealistic and drawn out as the end approached.  Still a fine writer and I'll try some of his other work.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|This movie has it all- action, budding romance, plot twists and plenty of excitement to keep fans on the edges of their seats. The cast is terrific.  These actors are so perfectly cast that I can really see a young Kirk, Spock and McCoy on the screen. The plot is new and yet familiar.  Old enemies are introduced in new ways, and there are plenty of surprises and plot twists to keep the adrenalin flowing.  A terrorist attacks Earth and once again the Enterprise and her crew are assigned to deal with the threat. On the way, relationships that will become lifelong friendships develop between the main characters, and we see the young crew maturing into solid young officers. I won't say why this is a prequel so as not to spoil the big reveal, but I was blown away.  It was just as fun watching it a second time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I've read both book one and two of this series. I'm getting ready to download the third book again, onto my Kindle to finish out the trilogy. Got to go...

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Character developement and human tendencies make this a classic King read.

Once you start you race through, the only disappointment being when you are finished, and want more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I purchased this for my son in late May.  It's now early September.  He has played it non-stop.  There are so many areas to this game and ways for people to be creative.  His friends and neighbors all play it and the conversations between everyone about what you can do with this game can get pretty interesting sometimes.  I love it.  It encourages the young and not so young to get creative with what is presented to them.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Love the movie. Loved it when I saw it in the theater and love that I can show it to my three year old grand daughter. Performances and production are flawless. Wish there were more films like this.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Thanks, the DVD is as good as new, and the case the disc was in did not have a nick or or mark of any kind=Great!

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am a die hard mahjong fan, so when this was Amazon's free app of the day, I jumped on it without batting an eye!  I've only been playing for a few minutes, but I can tell you, it's love!  There are a couple of ways to play this game including story mode &amp; endless.  Anyway, if you love mahjong, this is a definite keeper.  Enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The personalities are the same as the real thing I am amazed that they finally made a game outta it.The graphics are just right this game has everything.you can even watch a clip from some of there movies.This is so far the funniest and most addictive game I played on my kindle fire HD
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|After the Kite Runner I had high expectations but found this book to be slow going and hard work, could not really feel engaged with the characters and was relieved to finish it.
B00846REIS|4.0|It definitely keeps your attention with the sex scenes but I wish the story would have progressed a little faster than the sex scenes being the majority of the book.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|This book immediately hit it off on a good start for me when the poem '15 minutes' actually added up to fifteen (Yes, I counted it to check!) I was initially quite disappointed based on this, despite my nitpicky counting, because of the lack of rhyme and the tameness of this first piece. It's a good thing I kept reading!<br />What this first poem lacks is definitely made up for by others. 15 Minutes is a gentle lulling into the anthology with a poem that is about not owning rather than being able to claim - something that is a repeated theme throughout the book. For every explicit, sensual piece there is another that tugs at the heartstrings and impacts you with so much loneliness and/or guilt at the infidelity or want. In the second poem, Lip Gloss and Undergarments, GPA manages to tell a story beautifully in poem form, with well created dialogue, even without needing speech marks. The mood is created well enough that any extra detail would just be surplus to requirements. It is incredibly visual and very sensual. This sensual feel is repeated in Fog.<br />Westin Incident, Forbidden Dance and Carnal Conversation are erotic - and definitely accept the title of this book! Great job, GPA! I would definitely recommend this book! It is versatile and well-written!

B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Vicious villain...heroic heroes...yum.Brings back the days of comic books and free floating fantasy unconstrained by the rules of a cyberworld
159413586X|4.0|I know that 10K+ people have made a review but I need a forum to have my say.....I am dissapointed by the ending.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />I think I would have preferred if Katniss died....or didn't marry either.  I understand what each character represented but for her to end up with Peeta was so sad.  I was still never \\"convinced\\" that she loved Peeta.  It seemed like her relationship with him was staged.  It was for the cameras.  The kids totally threw me.  I wouldn't have expected her to have kids.  I wouldn't have expected a victor having been to hell and back, having kids. Her true foundation was with Gale.  Not the \\"love story\\", but the one who supported her, who had her back.  He stuck with her through it all.  I would have preferred her with Gale, hunting and going to the lake for clarity but still having an emptyness.  I felt like the characters in this book betrayed who they have been through the first 2 books.  I liked the idea of Peeta and Delly, who both lost all of their family in the destruction of District 12.  I would have liked to see Peeta develop into a stronger character and that he would have the high ranking position in at the end of the story.  Gale seemed like he was most comfortable hunting, setting traps and providing for his family.  I can see the natural progression of his characters from animals to humans but he didn't seem to seek higher responsibility.  I expected it but was sad that Finnick died when he was only just recently reunited with Annie.  Probably too much of the parent in me but why would Annie, who was half out of her mind have a child..I felt this was so irresponsible.<br /><br />I really didn't like that Katniss killed Coin instead of Snow when she had the chance.  From the point in which Boggs dies....page 286...it just went down hill for me.  I didn't feel the terror of the sewer/underground mutts.  I felt rushed.  It just seemed to fall apart.  People died so hurriedly.  I have vowed to re-read from this page on again but sorry to say it all lost me from there.  I didn't expect Prim to die.  I never saw her coming to the front lines even in her medical capacity.  She was 13/14.  I always felt that she was the hopefullness of the story.  How her generation would have thoughts and opportunities that those fighting the war wouldn't have imagined.<br /><br />Oh well.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I bought this CD for just a couple of the songs.  It's an okay album.  First JT album I ever purchased.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I think it is very sci fi and entertaining. I enjoyed it. I wouldn't mind to see a sequel of it maybe more stories developed
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|It was fun but what was promised to be \\"hours\\" spent playing really wasnt.  I finished in under an hour and was really disappointed
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton is truly addictive. Even my husband watches it.  I can not wait for season 4, is it January yet???????
140006922X|5.0|Very clear and exciting. Whole new look at Jesus the man. The history of the time was great. Not trying to convert, just the historical facts. Loved it
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Very well written and easy to read. I liked the tone and writing style a lot, but never got into the story. My mind would wander- the plot never pulled me in. I didn't really care about the characters or what happened to them. I did not end up finishing the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.I always get addicted to subway surfers. My mom gets mad<br /> if I play to much.Know I'm going to continue playing.
B000I186FW|5.0|Dialogue is all to often substandard or altogether missing, quite refreshing to hear once again. Particularly when an ideology is espoused.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|The game starts out really easy. Then the fun kicks in with really challenging clues. Some of the clues even had me stumped. Love to play this game round robin with the family.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I was very excited to read this because it was hyped in all the magazine reviews. No spoilers here but I guessed it 4 chapters into the book. It wasn't that good honestly and I was very disappointed.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|Great quality toy. Very realistic details of this real predator Dino. My son loves it! Highly recommend it. Looks great
0452257743|5.0|omgosh!!  i never thought id see this book again.  i read it years ago and somehow somewhere it got misplaced.  i am so glad to have it back!!  was a wonderful surprise in my mailbox!!
0321544080|5.0|A friend ad this as a wish gift so I bought it. He really was excited over it. So I can't say to much because I never looked at it myself.
B00640UICA|4.0|I agree with most reviewers who has diligently gave their honest feedback. This game is indeed cute to look at and game-play is near perfect. It responds to touch nicely and graphics are well presented. The puzzles are nice and challenging. There are some modules that do mobile 'analytics' and 'monetization' seen even in the paid version of this game (Flurry Analytics) which I personally do not like and could be of some privacy concerns to users who play this game with Wi-Fi ON.<br /><br />I have seen these types of modules in very popular games before and even from trusted developers and no one really cares, But the real reason for losing 1 star is the price. I think it will be fair if developer & Amazon releases this with revised price of 99c.<br /><br />Four stars from me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am always amused at shallow reviews from those who can't grasp a subject so they trash the story.  Stick with poo bear folks its a much easier read.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|The game was obtained when it was free app of the day on Amazon recently and attempted on [[ASIN:B00E0EY7Z6 ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch 16 GB Tablet, Blue (ME173X-A1-BL)]]. I did not find any suspicious permissions during the install (May be developer and Amazon removed those suspicious permissions as FAOTD) Having said. the graphics looks pretty good on the ASUS tablet and fits perfectly in Portrait mode.<br /><br />I do have some feature enhancement requests, Developer needs to add a PAUSE feature, Also make provisions to change the positions of the towers once the game-play is in progress to make it fair with the AI. The AI seems to be powerful and is tailored to win too quickly thereby discouraging long play time.<br /><br />For the price @ $2.99 people do expect more from a app like this. With all the considerations I am rating this game with 3 respectable stars.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|This is the last in the sequel...it's sad not to look forward to the next one! Had a great time reading it...I just found the end too predictable, somehow ... but then again, this is an expected feature in the shopaholic saga.
B000TEPKS4|5.0|one of the great ones i wish the original album art came with the purchase I hav no more words
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Roald Dahl never disappoints.<br />This movie brought his impossible<br />world to life.  The vulnerabilities of<br />Children before adult wrath was so clear and the choice of passivity or action in the face of evil was brilliantly portrayed.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|When this game was first released it was great. But in the last year Buffalo Studios has taken almost all the fun away. Players lose collection items,  coins, hard earned credits, gifts, and their customer support is the absolute worst!!! They encourage you to invite friends as players, but only allow you to collect a small fraction of gifts you receive. Now, they are limiting what items you win can be giftted! So save your $$$ and find another bingo game to play...
B005MLOKXA|3.0|Really good story line, interesting legal cases and good acting.<br />I have dropped it by two stars because of the obscene homosexual content.
B003VANOFY|2.0|wireless function is excellent, mic quality is very good but picks up on a lot of ambient high frequencies which can be grating for people listening, good range and battery. headphone sound is just okay, main problem with sound is random electronics noise that shows up here and there while plugged in (beeps and pops). as others have stated the unit is a bit frustrating to turn on at times, but I haven't experienced serious show-stopper problems in that regard. there seems to be L-R balance issues if sending surround sound to the headset. the entire package just feels clunky and unfinished.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I had been anticipating Ariana Grande's album all summer long and now that it's here, it is absolutely amazing. I had a feeling Ariana's album would become a hit.<br /><br />The album starts out with \\"Honeymoon Avenue.\\" It may sound different from the original version heard on YouTube, but in my opinion, this version is much better especially with the violin strings in it.<br /><br />The tracks \\"The Way,\\" \\"Baby I,\\" \\"Right There,\\" \\"You'll Never Know\\" and \\"Lovin' It\\" have that '90s throwback R&B vibe to it which makes the album sound magnificent.<br /><br />The songs \\"Tattooed Heart\\" and \\"Daydreamin\\" has that '50s\'60s throwback style and Ariana's beautiful vocals make them sound amazing!<br /><br />\\"Almost is Never Enough\\" with the Wanted's Nathan Sykes has to be the best song on the album. This ballad is so beautiful, you just want to listen to it over and over again.<br /><br />Ariana is one talented young woman and also a rising, shining star. If you're a fan of Ariana Grande's music, then you don't want to miss out on her debut album.
B003MC5N28|1.0|Terrible book don't waste your money on unless you have to or you accidentally buy it but If I were you I wouldn't waste my time or money on this book
B0007OCG56|4.0|Adam Sandler does a fantastic job in this drama comedy! Family friendly, good story line and Cloris Leachman rocks her role!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|At first i thoght it was dumb but it turned out cooler than ever. I walked around looking for pages and ran into slender who when i looked at him made the screen go all weird. I also tried other slenderman games but most oder them really suck bad (sorry if i spell things wrong) they should make another one itz awesome ^-^ pls find this helpful
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Game is great! Easy to follow just right for beginners and experienced players!!!<br />Play it every night.<br /> Daughter and son play
B004ATL0NS|5.0|A very good collection of old and fairly new songs. A little bit for everybody wish it will have more duets.
1416955070|3.0|I did enjoy reading this book for all the creativity, suspense, and humor.  Lots of funny lines that make the main characters believeable teenagers, and the main character Clary is quite likeable.  As the first book in the series it reads like an introduction to the fantasty world including all different types of species and characters (there are Shadowhunters, vampires, demons, super demons, werewolves, warlocks to name a few).  It is difficult to keep all the backstories and information straight by the time you get to the end and the book felt overly ambitious.  I didn't like the ending of the first book so I may not read more but I did think this first book was worth reading.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|Needs more work, and HD. It was really slow and I was quite frustrated on how the actual app loaded. I had to restart the app several times for channels to appear.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Truly makes a person wonder if the plot is more true than known, in this world of government cover ups.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have always had my loves, likes, obsessions, and deep interests.  The Pinterest App allows me to share all of the above with people all over the USA-as well as open up new avenues of interests I have just discovered.  I used to think that NO ONE ELSE thought about things the way I did only to find out hundreds of people do.  My Supernatural board is the best example of this.  Go to my boards on Pinterest if you like weird, humor, amazing photos, food, books, movies, Dean and Sam and Cas, etc.  But get this App first.
B003GK2216|5.0|I LOVED this book as &#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34; was already incredible-I read the book approximately 15 years ago and to read this was just a continuation of an absolutely FANTASTIC story.  I &#34;went missing&#34; until the book was finished.  Now I need to read it again to re absorb things I may have missed!!! I would HIGHLY recommend it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is one of the best version 1.0 products I have ever seen.  Very easy to connect provided you know what an HDMI port is and where it is located on you TV.  You will also need to know your WIFI password.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't talk about my findings though.  But by no means will this stop me from putting them on every TV I have at my house, work, and at every sporting event we host.<br /><br />A con:<br />When casting from a tab at very high resolution the tv display seems to get worse.  It is small and grainy...very strange.  Tried several different exceptionally hi-res configurations and never could get it to correct.  This may have been a local network limitation as well.  I wouldn't worry about this actually as very few will use it as I tested it.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00CEF014E|3.0|This book was good but it is definitely not for everyone. It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat though. I would not go as far as saying it was great but it certainly wasn't terrible either.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent account of what it's like to be an elite SEAL.... Amazing for the homefront to read and learn just what these guys go through to keep us safe.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I like gangstar Vegas so bad!!! . Never get gangstar Rio stupid game<br />Gangstar Vegas has so much to do it has a big city a big desert in the airport you could drive free helicopters and water planes
B0049J2CKE|1.0|We bought the movie but Amazon was unable to stream it despite several attempts.  We were still able to stream from Netflix just fine and our high speed internet (100mbps) was working fine.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|My favorite movie series, i dont know what i would do with out harry potter in my life!!! Great buy!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I love the pump action. Right from the opening scene to the elimination of &#34;Ma-ma&#34; it was action galore and Judge Dredd was simply spectacular. I also love the fact that Rookie Anderson braced up to the reality on ground by getting in the game!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I know it is cliche, but the book is better than the show. I watched the show first and the book filled in the missing piece  and really brought it all together.  The cast is spot on. Great read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Simple, fun, and fast. I like knocking people down (on games! I swear that's what I mean) so I love it.
B003WUYP56|4.0|I like his open-minded approach to science, physics specifically, on why theories must be taken with a grain of salt. When he states that that speed can go faster than light's, I tend to agree with this heretical thought. Light travels NOT in constant speed, all because light has different wave length components. And I maintain that entropy does NOT increase with time, that in theory the universe in entirety aims for perfection; that the &#34;destruction&#34; or &#34;mess&#34; created in the universal individualistic processes create the stages for the next spiral for &#34;greater glory&#34; without implicating any religious meaning to this assertion. Nowadays, another U-turn is taking place: that the Black Hole is not an inescapable locale, that in theory Black Holes are picky devourers, that only a minuscule of the matter and energy that pass through a Black Hole (about 5%) are kept. I expect that before man can come to A Grand Theory, many of what science accepts now as theory is just the seminal start of a hypothesis.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|good app, runs with impressive stability on my Gingerbread Android phone, although I would have preferred an option to reduce screen paper brightness to avoid fatigue.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Coelho takes on the big questions in life, and answers them in an entertaining, although slightly simple, story. His introduction is brilliant, and is worth reading even if you never touch the novel itself.
0071766588|5.0|I was hopping that this Item contain more like &#34;tricks&#34; to get a better grade, but even so this material is very usefull I think is better that I was hopping, I actual studing and getting more and more interest about it. It is a great guide for people whos preparing for first time to the test
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is the best game ever!!!!!! It is like Mario bros but with a lepracan and is much funner. The graphics are great and the controls are easy. Whoever made this game deserves a reward I have been waiting for a game like this since I got my kindle.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love to find craft ideas I can do with the children or new ideas for dinner. keep on crafting :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is a wide variety of games you can play and they are all fun. A lot of games are locked but you can use points you get by playing games to unlock them the games are fun and challenging but not so much it's  frustrating. I don't know why there are so much one star reviews this app is fun and there is a lot of games so you won't get bored do I recommend that you get this app. If you need  help pause the game and press help.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I very rarely buy games because I always see to feel they eat into my productivity, but for some reason I felt like this game was honing my senses and preparing me to take on the world ;)
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have enjoyed watching the dynamic of the two main characters.  They offset each other very well.  I like the messages that come across that doing the right thing usually works out the best.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I found myself caught up in the story and caring about the characters, experiencing suspense even thought the historical events are well known.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Midnight in Paris is one of Woody Allen's more playful and fantastical films that just tickles the fancies but keeps its New Yorker sensibilities about it.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I'd say that while this is not the best epic series I've ever read, it is quite good. I would say that unlike some of the better ones I've read I can step away from this series and not pick it up again for a month or two. It is though, very well written with very in depth descriptions of characters as they transform over the course of time and a deep backstory. The plot is engaging and while it does have moments that are quite slow, during these times, there are pepperings of intrigue to keep the reader ensnared.
0062020056|5.0|I had to read this for a college class and was not looking forward to it to say the least.  I'm the type of person when I'm assigned a book to read, I immediately have this preconceived notation that the book is going to be super boring. However, when I started reading it I was pleasantly surprised! It was a really inspirational story and an easy read! I was so entertained I finished the book in 6 days! SO worth every penny! Go William!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It glitches every once in a while but otherwise is great! If you restart it the glitches go away. Works on cheap tablets too
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful photography, excellent writing and an outstanding cast - an all around wonderful show!  With so much on TV that's just trash, this is a real treasure.
1433537419|4.0|This edition is simply sumptuous; you just want to rub its soft brown cover for hours. The notes are extensive, and cover many issues in a depth unusual for Bible notes; they also offer summaries of all major points of view about disputed passages, suggesting which is best but not insisting on it. They are accompanied by maps, drawings, or charts on nearly every page of this luxurious volume. There is also an introduction to each book featuring chronology, outline, and notes on authorship, dating, and content. There is an an extensive concordance at the end. In keeping with he essentially literal focus of the ESV, the notes tend toward conservative, inerrantist interpretations. If your theology leans that way, this is the Bible for you.<br />  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the translation, which is perhaps unfair to this very attractive edition. It renders a crucial part of 1 Tim. 3:15 as &#34;the church, 'a' (sic) pillar and buttress of the truth&#34;, thus obscuring, for what I can only conclude are controversial reasons, a key ecclesiastical teaching. Every other version I consulted, the KJV, NKJV, RSV, NRSV, NIV, Good News, NAB, even the Moffat translation, says that the church is THE bulwark, not just one among many. This obvious slanting of the text toward a particular theology makes me wonder how many other distortions there may be. But if that doesn't bother you, this study Bible is hard to beat.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Lots of fun , makes you smile and laugh when his neck gets squished ;) not bad for a free app.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My niece love it.  The material is good and it can be assembled easily. However, She wishes there was a cover at the top of bathroom.
1476715904|4.0|I usually don't read the romance models but this is a good book.  I laughed, cried and bonded with the group.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Nice looking keyboard app with themes to customize look and feel. Also settings page allows to control many keyboard preferences.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's a simple remake of an old classic,  but this to be with a leveling system. That's pretty much it.  The latter levels get annoyingly hard.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|This is a funny series and the music is great.  The actors have really good voices, dancing, and acting abilities. This is such a fun show.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Gangster Squad never really found it's center as it weaved its way from action, drama, comedy, dramedy, and outright 1950's campiness.  A great cast is let down by poor writing, and the cinematography leaves a lot to be desired as it is a cross between the Batman TV Series (think &#34;Pow&#34; and &#34;Bam&#34;) and Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy.  The movie is worth sitting through, but nothing I would see twice.
0785153942|3.0|Loved Pacific Rim, and I'm glad to see an expansion on that universe. I liked the stories but it was drawn pretty horribly. The Jaegers and Kaiju looked cool but the artist doesn't do basic human facial expressions so well, to the point where it was actually distracting. It's a nice addition to my collection of Pacific Rim stuff, but I could've done with just borrowing it from a friend.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|The charger works fine, almost no difference compared to the standard Apple AC adapter. The cable is quite rigid though, especially for a car charger that's supposed to be extended.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|This was highly recommended to me by a friend; and I agree it's an excellent movie.  Denzel Washington does his usual job of wonderful acting; and the storyline is very interesting!  It's great entertainment!<br />Phyllis A.
B00AMS38YU|4.0|Good movie, nice plot and story line. It was a good movie the story line was different, not what I was expecting.  Overall good movie, lots of bike tricks which I thought were pretty cool.
B00BMR5HOO|3.0|The app updated fine, I just was lokking for something with more graphic, the board looking background just did not do much for me.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|Like the app, I just wish you could write on a larger portion of the screen instead of a comment size box at the bottom
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I have this on my kindle.  Reminder what you may have forgot to  do today.  Exercises are diversified and you can put in the length of time you want to do the whole one.  I use the Full Exercise
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Having grown older and lived through all of this music, life and times it has been a real treat and revelation to find a common denominator to so much of what I have experienced and relished through those years. Glad to have found this jewell to help fill in the blanks and my soul with smiles and warmth.
B00CMQX84A|4.0|When I originally watched the movie and noticed it was a musical I almost turned it off, but I kept watching.  Another point that almost made me turn it off was it was basically about two characters dating in the beginning of the film and that doesn't fly with me so I almost turned it off.  But I kept watching and this turned out to be a really good movie.  The music is neat.  As the story goes on it's about a pair of teenagers being stuck in a movie from 1962.  The actors that were in this part did a really great job.  It seemed to really be like a 1960's era movie going by how the girls talked.  I was really surprised by it.  I would recommend it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The title says it all. While I realize there are weather geeks out there, I am not one of them. It gives what I need on the front page, an easy draw down page. Does anyone need 5 pages of ( really detailed, excellent scientific) information, the predicted wind speed and direction for the next 5 days?<br /><br />It's a great app. And too much is better than not enough. Just be warned, if you have a Dad who gets a hold of this app, your conversations will be about the weather in Des Moines, while you live in So Cal.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|this controller is easy to use and the batteries that come with it are long lasting but it needs more games to be compatible with it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I truly loved this book.  It was so refreshing to read from a man's point of view. I don't know how she did it but it was like a guy wrote it. That's talent. This book was so much fun to read. And don't forget about the romance and sex, WOW.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Awesome for the price!  Well wealth the purchase, I haven't had any issues since I originally purchase this device! Get it!
B002QEXN2K|3.0|The more I hear Mayer's music the less I like it. I loved everything of his up to Continnum, then it seems something changed in his voice and deliverance. The fire went out.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Acting alittle weak but the story made up for it and the special effects were very good.  I enjoyed all the action and fun parts too.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Like the versatility. Multiple alarm tones and multiple alarms for just about any occasion. Would reccommend it to anyone. Loud enough for my spouse too. Like the options for sound volume.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|It was hard to follow. They switched without much meaning or connection to each scene.  I love Tom Hanks but was not sure what they were trying to get across.
B001NHNG64|4.0|It was very entertaining and it had good twist that kept me intrigued. I am reading my way through the series. So far it's good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is fun easy. I thank it would be good for all kids. If you where me I would get it for ever one in your family. It is like Temple Run 1&amp;2
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Just a sweetly charming movie with beautiful acted characters, glorious music and wonderful English countryside scenes. Truly inspired combination of actors.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|Acting by Matt Damon and Danny de Vito was perfect. The story line engaging and convincing. Good movie at a great time altogether.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter and spent the entire movie laughing as hard as she did!  Very clever use of the actors who did the voice-overs.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Clever story of competition set within a circus environment. Magic is the game and it is feigned, yet real. Entertaining!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did learn many things about the life of Afghans. Too much of the story was about other places in the world. It was worth my time and effort
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Already had app.  Selected again by mistake.  It is okay, but nothing special for my needs at this particular time.
B00C6F624K|5.0|I forget how toucjhing and funny this movie is.  As I get older myself it becomes mre relevant.  Kathleen Turner has never been better and that beautiful music.  Lovew it
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Selected by mistake.  Don't have time for this type of stuff right now.  Deleted from my Kindle.  Better choice will be made next time.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It is a great movie! I love that it has Spanish as a language, my dad was able to watch it and he loved it!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I really enjoy this album, I've already listened to it more than 8 times. I originally bought because I really liked counting stars. As I listened to the tracks I also fell in love with preacher (the other tracks as well). The lyrics to these songs are very touching.
B0072IUZUS|5.0|Like all the other Schleich products we have purchased, great attention to detail, and very sturdy action figure.  Our son plays with them for hours.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Being  a SciFi geek from before it was popular, I was glad to see that BBC revamped the Dr. Who series. It is a great show that is family friendly.
B006S01GH2|5.0|The story is nice and happy, but the true joy of this movie for me is that it's a feast for the eyes. The scenes are so beautifully set up that it is like browsing through a coffee table book. I could watch this over and over. (And does it ever look good on the Kindle Fire HD!)
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I don't know what the Fox network was thinking, this show was one of the best things to come out of 2000. Great actors, great story lines, I mean come on, Space and Cowboys does it get much better than this? Browncoats unite and demand something be done to get this show back to us in some media form or another.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|I had a great time watching this movies before I went out to watch part 2. I think it's a real easy movie to like and enjoy.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|I found this game terrible.  It won't let you do moves that ARE definitely good moves.  Can't even find a help area.  Only played it twice.
B000002KXV|5.0|I love Steely Dan so I thought I'd give this solo effort a try. It's great; if you're a fan of Steely Dan you'll enjoy this CD.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I stumbled across this show while browsing Prime Instant Video. For whatever reason neither of us had ever heard of this show. The ratings were very good so we gave it a shot. I AM SO GLAD WE DID! We finished season 1 in less than a week and only have 3 episodes of season 2 left. The characters in this show are fantastic. The show is funny with a serious side that is always lurking in the background.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Boz Scaggs has mellowed a bit with age and is getting back to his blues roots. This is a really excellent CD- also just saw him in concert at Longwood Gardens and his voice is still outstanding.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|the photos taken with a Polaroid 600 look like a sepia print.  There is no color in any of the photos taken.
B00821OX98|5.0|This movie shows a community of people overcoming oppression from creatures of another planet. I enjoyed and still have to finish the series.
0143123173|5.0|This is a first read for me of Craig Johnson.  I was leery at first, but the minute I started reading I was hooked.  The descriptions of the surrounding mountains and landscape were breathtaking.  The humor was great and helped move the story and plot along.  Walt and his cronies held my attention throughout the book.  My only complaint was that I was cheering for Walt and Vonnie.
0062238310|5.0|Loved this book! I would highly recommend it to any Downton Abbey Fan. The scripts are complete, as Julian Fellowes wrote them, so the book contains many scenes that never made it in the episodes. It adds tremendously to the stories and includes Fellowes' commentary on much of the characters and dialogue. It is also a wonderful antidote to those Downton Abbey withdrawals when you cant watch the episodes themselves!
B00D23GXB2|4.0|This book was gifted to me in exchange of an honest opinion, so here it goes :<br /><br />Revenge of the Orgasm is a book of poetry...I've always loved to read poetry and I often write them myself, but I had never read a sensual poetry book before...I'll have to say that it really was an enjoyable read...I finished it under 30 minutes...that's just how intriguing it was...after each poem I would say `'This is the last one'' but kept on reading anyway until the book was finished...GPA knows what he's talking/writing about and he managed to pull his readers into a world of seduction with each and every poem in his book. And what I loved the most about it was that he did it tastefully...
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|This is my song review one by one  just in my own opinion. Buy the album and check em' out.<br /><br />Fast In My Car: 7/10<br /><br />Now: 8/10 This reminds of me their old stuff, it brings back memories but also with something new in it.<br /><br />Grow Up: 7/10 Upbeat song, its cute<br /><br />Daydreaming: 8/10 Its a really catchy song, Not my favorite on the album but i always find myself singing it out loud.<br /><br />Interlude: Moving On: 10/10 I love all the interludes, they're great and wish they could all be longer.<br /><br />Ain't it fun: 9/10 Great song to just dance in your room to<br /><br />Part II: 10/10 My opinion, best song on the album. Its just beautiful and lovely hearing the contrast between Let The Flames Begin on the Riot album and Part II of the song which is this one.<br /><br />Last Hope: 10/10 Slow song, but awesome lyrics and really nice to listen to<br /><br />Still into you: 10/10 First song i heard from the album, and i loved how Paramore-y it sounded and how different it sounded at the same time. SUPER upbeat, and such a change but i loved it.<br /><br />Anklebiters: 8/10 Not bad, catchy again but not my favorite<br /><br />Interlude:Holiday 10/10 Love the interludes.<br /><br />Proof: 8/10 Pretty soft rock, not much to say about this one<br /><br />Hate to see your heart break: 8/10 One of those soft songs, its nice and sweet and sad. i like her voice in this one<br /><br />Interlude: I'm not angry anymore: 10/10 INTERLUDE!<br /><br />Be alone: 9/10 love to sing to this song!<br /><br />Future: 10/10 One of my favorite songs. Its long but its beautiful. its a lot of instrumental, but worth it. its soft and melodic, the sound it just so great!<br /><br />The album is definitely worth it. GO AND BUY IT! :)
B0064W667Y|5.0|I read this series years ago when I worked at a comic bookstore. It was well drawn and intoxicatingly good reading. Even knowing how everything turns out, I still yearned to OWN Fables, and when the first graphic novel went on sale for $1.99, I jumped at the chance. Once again it has not disappointed!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I thought no one could come close to The Sopranos, but this show is at least as good.  At the end of every episode I think, &#34;Wow, what is he going to do now?&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|stopped working 1 hour after install. followed directions; subscribed to netflix watched one 45 minute movie &#34;hell on wheels&#34; then in went tits up; talked to the manufacturer for four hours. six different IT's no joy. This thing sucks.
B002I8PVQA|4.0|Saw it twice and liked it both times.  It's not a movie that will stick with you over time, but it is good entertainment for an evening.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was an amazing mystery story with surprises around every chapter. The main characters were convoluted and it had a surprising end.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book<br />This book is awesome I love it I prefere you download it also read the new one that's coming out
1574216988|5.0|Lots of new tangles in an easy-learn format, and great ideas for applications. A great zentangle resource. A go- to book!
B000V39KDO|5.0|Awesome detail, luved the fighting scenes!  Definitely not a movie you can get up from and not miss any details
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I picked this up a while back as the free app of the day when it ran before.  Since then I've completed it,  which is rare for me,  Mr. Bored-and-moves-on.  In this game you play through a story and acquire the pieces you're seeking by aging the mahjong board that is offered,  in which there are two gold coins that you must match to win.  Those are usually way at the bottom of the pile.  You play through different phases,  a series of boards in each phase,  and each has its own set of tiles and series of layouts.  The story and series of different boards make this a great deal of fun vs standard mahjong.<br /><br />Also,  the ads are only before you start aging.  I see this as much different than banners or pop-ups throughout a game as the bad sort of ads tend to do.  A promotion of a developer's own stuff briefly before the game and then you never see it while playing isn't really that big of a deal...  Ads inside the game as I'm playing would be.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was such a wonderful book. I didn't want to put it down. Very inspiring. Everyone should read this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love this book.  Super interesting and thought provoking. I have always loved Steven King and this is another reason why.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|If you came of age in the 60's or 70's, you were there.  This one is for you.  Enjoy! Enjoy!
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you're a child of the 90s, this is the movie to watch.  Dave Grohl is a master story teller.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I saw the film when it was released and then again recently.  So many details missed the first time.  good to watch it again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was a lifesaver.  Struggling with the loss of my beloved lab, Misha, after 12 years I was in a world of hurt.  Nothing helped and I kept sinking deeper into my sadness.<br /><br />Bless my dear friend, Jamie, who sent me the book.  If you've ever loved a dog, wanted a dog, or know the pain of losing your four-legged alter-ego it's a great read.<br /><br />Others will fill in the details of this wonderful story but it was my lifeline when I truly needed one.  It helped me laugh and, most importantly, it gave me permission to cry.  And it gave me the courage to stand up again.<br /><br />Bless you, Garth Stein.  Bless you Jamie for throwing me a lifeline.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|The amplification is good but unfortunately all the sounds in the room are ampliiied.  That means if you are wanting to listen to tv but there are others in the room talking you are still going to have trouble hearing. One thing i have not tried yet is put a \\"cone\\" around the receiver microphone to minimize the influence of outside noise. A good thing is you dont have to use the \\"cheapy\\" headphones supplied with it, you could use your favorite ones.
B007UK83S4|5.0|I am an avid fan of 60's, 70's and 80's music and have read many biographies and autobiographies from and about musicians from these eras. This is a fabulous read. Any journey of success always has an element of torment and tragedy, and it is with Pete Townshend's story. A man who came from a childhood during the war and the relationships that bridged his family, bands and friendships over the years that shaped one of the great musicians of the rock era. You will be surprised by his frank and unabashed descriptions of his life and all that went to make his musical career such a success. Thanks for your story Pete!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Any game conning out of  Gameloft is sure to be the best in its genre. Finally a company that makes games for tablets that are not arcade games.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|Twisted. Disturbing. It's a great read for the right audience, but it's definitely not for everyone. I thoroughly enjoyed every page.
1419705644|4.0|Adventure Time is a unique animated series that appeals to kids and adults like. This encycloaedia carries on in that same vein. Ostensibly written by Hunson Abadeer (demonic Lord of Nightosphere) it covers characters, places, and things, in the land of Ooo, giving the self-styled Lord of Evil's caustic take on them. Notes are scrawled in my various other characters.<br /><br />A straight-forward encyclopedia might have been more informative, but the internet well covers basic facts up the show. This is a humorous addition the the mythos in its own right.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this ap does more then I though it would. I can keep over 1000 books separated and organized. I can add and delete very easily. also best feature I have found was that it has a voice read out option. this has come in handy when I lost my voice and I had to teach a class. yes the voice talked fast but yet you could keep up. I don't like that if u have to pause for a moment it starts back up from the beginning. however I did find that all voice readers do that so I guess its not a big deal. now to create a checklist too and I can loose another ap. something to think about.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Some episodes slower than others, but overall entertaining.  Show is not for the young or Squimish, lots of blood violence.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Ever since I read Relic. I have always looked forward to new Pendergast novels. This one was great as always.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|These are great! Perfect white light, stay on just the right amount of time and look nice :) Great for places hard to light.
0062255657|5.0|Wonderfully written and very heart felt. It helps to reflect on your own life and think, has my life been worth it?
0394800184|5.0|Another wonderful read for our great grandson. We got the book for his 5th birthday and it was an instant hit. Over and over we were asked to read the book. Our first granddaughter loved this book. So happy we were able to find a copy and make memories.
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|On a recent road trip, I was able to bring my portable hard drive along with my ipad and play any movie I wanted using this wonderful device. It made my trip much more enjoyable to be able to watch all my movies, since my Ipad has limited disk space. And I was able to transfer photos from my camera and look at them on the ipad, which was super helpful.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The comic character is more appropriately brought to life in the context of a short story with a simple but brilliantly performed plot. The dialogue was good, the acting was better, and this vision of the future was more aligned with the comic's original concept.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is an awesome show. You never know what's going to happen next. I love the interactions between Harvey and Mike, the sexual tension between Mike and Rachel, and the wittiness of Donna.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I have read th his book every summer since my Junior year of high school and I never get tired of this incredible book.  I often find that it affects me differently with each reading.  This is as must read!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Ray has a very unique, haunting voice.  Lyrics can be sort of odd, but the beats and the sounds are great.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got hooked when I played the free version and had to buy the full version. For $0.99 is cheap for a game this fun. I would recommend for anyone and has you get further in days it get lil challenging. I enjoy the story and puzzles as well.
B003U4UPTE|2.0|1st season was great....then....<br />I will blindly push a button FOREVER for no good reason.......ok, that makes perfect sense. (remember, the characters are not supposed to here the ominous background music, if they could - I suppose there would be a tiny reason to keep pushing...)
B003D5X3VM|5.0|I'm having a love affair with each track!  I would highly recommend to all and I am currently sharing my CD with a friend, who MUST return shortly!
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|This story has a lot of history of the early days of Scotland and England.  It also gives you a view of the class system they had to endure in those days.  Very exciting movie to watch.... you won't get bored!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read.  Quick and easy.  Liked the story and flowed really well.  The story could have got more involved but it didn't.
B0053TMP24|4.0|It took me from 10:30 one day and finished this report at 11:03 the next but its one of the best books I have ever read I would suggest the lost hero or sea of monsters there good to. Thank you for your time enjoy reading.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife Is An Awesome Show! Can't Wait Until The Next Season Begins! Juliana Is A Gem On The Screen! She Literally Makes The Cast Come Alive! September29Th!!
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|I was really surprised at how good this movie was. I was expecting it to be &#34;B&#34;ish but old Arnie came through again with a pretty solid movie...especially for an old action guy.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|can't wait for part 2 hope they do not take 3 years to come with i want to still have good vision when it is out.
0812550706|5.0|One of my all time favorite books this is truly a joy to read. Not sure how the new movie coming out is going to be but I figured I don't have this in my collection and its an all time favorite I figured I would pick up a copy finally.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I am just a sucker for these Planet of the Apes movies. Some interesting points and ethics come into play as well.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|FIRST INSTALLMENT WAS MUCH BETTER. WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE POOR SCRIPT.  GREAT CAST OF ACTORS - BUT NEEDED BETTER WRITERS.
B0025KVLTM|3.0|Some good songs are found here in this album. Good as a collector item and do not miss it. Worthy of keeping.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful look at what life was like in high society in England not so long ago.  The characters are great, and the acting is great.  I am hooked!
B00EKJWS1Q|5.0|Absolutely a great app! I installed this app because I was very unhappy with the email program that came with my Kindle Fire HD. When I would go into the program it would just give me the subject of the email but not the rest of the email such as the body or even the attachments which I get every once in awhile. And if I was lucky enough to get the body of the email and it had a link and I would click on it I wasn't ever taken anywhere and it never would let me open the attachment. Since installing Outlook Web Lite I've been able to get all of my emails - subject, body, links and attachments. I click on the links and it takes me to the sites and it even lets me open the attachments without a problem. I really like this app and I'm so glad I installed it.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|By far, one of the best books I've read in a while.  It came as a recommendation and I have since highly recommended it to others.  Great!
6300216748|5.0|great to see these two megastars when they were on the ascent in their powerful youth and beauty.  It's also fun to see how far technology has developed since that time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Along the same lines as other Hosseini books.  He's an amazing author.  I like how he develops the characters before diving into the story line.
0470913029|4.0|I have MS and have been on this diet for about 2 months.  Notice a big difference in my legs.  Feel years younger. I believe it is the lack of inflammation. Between the Paleo diet and stretching exercises, I feel like I did 15 or 20 years ago at least!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|This is a great app for all of my devices. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I like using the web albums and the fact that they are available from anywhere.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|Good sleeve does what its job but will probably get a case that has a stand.  I do love the coral color.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book extremely interesting.  The fact that it is written by a neurosurgeon makes it very compelling.  The doctor considers every possible explanation for his experience and ends up convinced that he truly did experience life beyond death and that he also was in the presence of God.  He doesn't seem to be the sort of person who would benefit from making up such a story nor does it seem likely that he would settle on this explanation if there was an alternative that made any sense.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Instead of a traditional review, I present you with the following: my attempt at a poem. Slam poetry plays a major role in Colleen Hoover's Slammed. Everything touched upon in the poem is what I took from the novel. Please note the bold sections come directly from Lake's poem, \\"Schooled,\\" and it's the poem she reads Will regarding her feelings. You can read the full blurb here. I absolutely adore this book and I think you will too.<br /><br />\\"By a Book\\"<br />I got schooled this year<br />By a book<br />A book that left me feeling<br />Love, hope, and sadness<br />I learned about life<br />And about death<br />How we wish we could plan<br />And prevent<br />But when he comes knocking<br />We can't pretend we're not home<br />We'd love to carve pumpkins<br />And eat basgna all day<br />But that's just it<br />We can deny and deny, but in the end<br />We all die<br />I got schooled this year<br />By a book<br />A book about a girl<br />Who meets a boy<br />A boy who chose the Lake<br />I learned to go out and be it<br />When I miss to do my best<br />I found a band to love<br />To accept others<br />And to never judge<br />I learned to question<br />To push boundaries<br />To laugh and to love<br />And to never regret<br /><br />I learned this in a book<br />One I believe you should read<br />I got schooled this year<br />By the author Colleen Hoover<br />By Will and Lake<br />And by Eddie who in the end quite didn't give a damn<br />This book is Slammed.<br /><br />**This review appears on my blog**
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Thas a great game, yet as everyone said the dev puts a lot of annoying ads. This is a paid app no need for that. Fix this. Take clean them all together or just make it way less intrusive.
0761536434|5.0|Steven Kent's history of video games is enormously engaging, wholly complete, and just a bunch of fun from beginning to end.<br /><br />If you grew up with video games--ESPECIALLY if you're a child of the 80's who was too young to properly appreciate the movements in the industry in the 8-bit and 16-bit days--this book is a must-read. Having cultural context and behind-the-scenes understanding of the movers and shakers in games development will inform your whole understanding of your place in gaming culture.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who appreciates games as a medium, both as an art form and as popular entertainment. Recommended, too, for anyone who is interested in the current trends in the games industry. This book is illuminating in both areas.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|The size, performance and quality is as I expected<br />I orderd it from amazon a week ago<br />Thank you anker
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I give it a five star rating because it is an awesome app. Plus I got it for free when it was promotional. Two days back.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh Groban is hands down one of my favorite male singers of all time. This c.d & d.v.d collection is a very worthy investment & I have thoroughly enjoyed not only listening to his stunning vocals while driving along in my car but also watching his d.v.d while in the comfort of my own home. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who is a fan of this genre of music!
B001CDZZI6|3.0|This was a required book for my company and I bought it &#34;used&#34;.  Unfortunately, I did not realize that the entire purpose of the book is the &#34;code&#34; enclosed in the back for the web based assessment.  Without the code, the book is not very useful. So I ended up paying again for a new book to take the assessment. With the code and the assessment, though, the book is a good tool to understanding personal strengths and those of others.  And yes, as the book indicates, my strengths were not what I would have originally thought.
B00CATONCA|5.0|so happy when I got this yesterday. planning to use this as a prop on my desk to scare my workers kids...
B005G4TJUC|5.0|a great continuation to the story! waiting for t4!! just wish shia was in it!!! hopefully it will be as good!!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This standing case for the Kindle Fire HD is an excellent purchase and one you would enjoy. It does all a casae must do to protect your Kindle plus you can stand the Kindle up and read hands free. Buy it now.

B005544V6A|5.0|What a fun series.  It has everything you could want.  Lots of suspense, comedy, drama, and just a plethora of plot !!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Love it!!! All Dawson's Creek fans should buy this ! Brings back old memories and still has relevant and current topics.
034580709X|4.0|Good read.  Having read all the others I wanted to fill it out with the first. Really? 4 more words required?
1484847148|5.0|i really like these stories with lexy and her unusual &#34;posse&#34;grandma and her geriatric girlfriends. This is the first where lexy meets Jack who lives behind her and is a police homicide detective investigating the murder of lexy's ex. suspense,romance and hilarity ensue. All this and recipes too.
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|My little girl absolutely loves Monster High and the doll line. Twyla is a perfect addition to her collection. The doll is super cute and comes with a pet dust bunny and her own stand. I know my daughter is going to get tons of fun from playing with her ^_^
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|While the graphics are great and it's easy to play, you don't really need all the hand holding to get through the steps in the game.  It ruins a lot of the fun when you are led through things step by painful step.  It's ok, but not as much fun as others.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I guess Piggies don't like Angry Birds, but that what they get for stealing their eggs.  Great game, hours of fun.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Bought this book after hearing her speak on the moth.  She told a wonderful story and I wanted to hear more.  The show is fun, but the book is marginal at best.  She's a wonderful speaker, but her writing is dull and uninteresting.  Couldn't get through it.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|she enjoyed the story very much. think she read in two days. she is 13 years old. we do recommend!
B00004YTIQ|1.0|To big and lose on my pool, created mold, and now is garbage, the best thing to do is to put a sheet with elastic on the pool and can be washed any time.....
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Great read ... excellent characters and laugh out loud adventures!  The history lesson comes lightly and adds so much to the story without taking away from the fun of the read.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The plot of the book depended on the interpretation of the language of flowers, which in itself was interesting and very different from anything else I have read.  The plot was finely drawn and the characters were unusual but believable.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Long and detailed, the novel leaves you wanting more. It's an epic adventure filled with interesting, robust characters both evil and pure.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I couldn't believe that the person who had such a wonderful way with language and plot could have written this novel.  I had to force myself to finish it, and then I wondered why I actually read the whole thing,  It never got better.
B009WUBERW|3.0|This is a high action spoof with just about every action actor that is still alive, including: Stallone, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Arnold, and others. They must have had a lot of fun making the movie.
B00AX6KNOY|3.0|It wasn't a great plot or movie.  I was a little entertained by the movie but it is one I would not watch again.
6305433909|5.0|I watched this movie several years ago and wanted to own it. It is fun, full of a lot of good music, and, I think, cleaner than the first one. I loved watching it again and the disc was in excellent condition. Thank you.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Loved the show a lot. Tatiana Maslany does a great job. You totally forget that she is playing all of the characters.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|One of the best movie ever, I'll buy the 3rd part soon, the special edition is more than awesome! !
B0058VW36U|5.0|Even though this game is a bit old I still enjoy playing it. It works well with no crashes yet.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is perhaps one of the reasons why dystopian novels are suddenly gaining popularity these days.<br /><br />The Giver gives us a break from the usual fantasy adventure, sci-fi and thriller books that we've come to love. The Giver brings us into a whole new world wherein the community just feels creepy and alien.<br /><br />In the Giver, we follow the story of Jonas, an ordinary boy who got the initial shock of his life when he was appointed as the successor of the \\"The Receiver of Memories.\\" Jonas and all the members of the perfect community do not feel pain nor the depth of emotions nor experience dreams. They were like robots trapped in a human's body where everything is just perfectly organized. Their roles in the community are dictated not by their choices but by the community officials. Although, they do not hurt each other and piously follow the rules of the officials, they do not know the real feeling of love, anger, sadness and most of all, the feeling of real happiness. All they have is a superficial emotion, dictated by the rules of the Society.<br /><br />As Jonas trains to become the Receiver of the Memories, his life suddenly took an interesting turn as he explored the depths and complexity of human life.  It is then that Jonas realized what he and the community are missing. The past memories that have been given to him by The Giver were like a breath of new life.

1423140605|4.0|This review is long overdue.  Can't help it, there are just so many things to do like stalking Rick R. for example.  Now that the release of House of Hades is looming nearer, I felt that it is only but proper to write a review for the preceding sequel which is the Mark of Athena.<br /><br />If you have managed to read the Son of Neptune (SoN), you can definitely relate to how I desperately waited for this book to come out. Son of Neptune, though excellent ended with a big cliffhanger that it made me want to read the next book right there and then.  I am happy to report that MOA answered the major questions in SoN nicely.  Annabeth was finally reunited with Percy and the seven demigods were introduced to each other.<br /><br />Rick Riordan's brand of humor was absolutely present in this book that it was hard to get bored even after reading a lot of pages. What's more is that the humor was multiplied seven times as MOA was told from the POVs of seven demigods. For some books, this approach might confuse the readers but it worked quite well in MOA since for me, it is important to connect intimately with our heroes and heroines.  What I admire most in Rick's character building is that he can manage to make all the seven demigods unique in their own ways.  There are no duplicates; each one has his or her own individuality. And how Rick managed to make them all loveable and appealing, I don't know.  That's still a mystery that I would like to ask Rick if ever I get that kind of opportunity. Amongst all the seven demigods, I think Leo Valdez really shone out in this book with his awesomeness and confidence in beating Narcissus for the \\"Coolness and Gorgeousness\\" award.<br /><br />A lot of things are happening in MOA that I didn't get bored even for a minute.  Its subplots were as engaging as the main plot that I can't complain about \\"lack of action scenes.\\" And the nice thing about it is that every sub-plot connected to the main plot to create an ambitious story such as this one. It neatly integrated the story of the gods into the modern world which makes the story more exciting than ever. Even the world building remained consistent transporting me to the places of so long ago where the godly battles occurred.<br /><br />Like the previous books, MoA also has its share of interesting entourage of gods and goddesses. And while it is almost impossible to introduce a lot of gods and goddesses in one book without sacrificing their characterization, Rick has managed to pull it off with a flourishing grace. This is perhaps why I love Rick's version of Greek mythology because he made these gods unforgettable by giving them personalities that the average person can relate to.is one.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Why do I have to write a review? I gave it 4 stars which means I like it. If this continues I won't rate things again.
0440418569|4.0|Yay. After days of poring over this series, I think the book fairy has finally let my soul found some peace.  And what's more beautiful is that, I can truly announce that this book is one of the most memorable must-read series for 2013. Yes, bookish addicts. After a year of hating this series, I've found myself falling inlove with it.  How did that freakin' happen? Find out!<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass started days after where the second book left off.  Will, who was separated from Lyra, was sought by two rebel angels who pledged their help to look for the latter in exchange for his help to Lord Asriel's cause.  Meanwhile, Lyra was put into an (almost) endless slumber by Mrs. Coulter for reasons that only her wickedness can answer. And this is where the fun had started since it wasn't only Will who was looking for her but also Lord Asriel's forces, the Magisterium (Church) and the Authority's arsenal of angels headed by Metatron. In this battle of tactics and race against time, Philip Pullman allures us once again into a kaleidoscope of worlds where everything is overwhelmingly possible. The convergence of Pullman's different worlds made a great setting for this story of such magnitude to unfold wonderfully and yet, it was sensible and compelling.<br /><br />Interwoven with this setting was a story of two ordinary children whose lives will dictate the undoing or the continuance of the very pillars of humanity. The Amber Spyglass does not only talk about war to gain power over the worlds but it delves into the realm of metaphysics, a journey to search the truth about God, His existence and whether He solely created the world. Then it followed the first downfall of man when Eve took to the temptation of the serpent but in exchange for consciousness her descendants. Next, there was the mystery of death, does the paradise of heaven really existed or departed souls just go into an inescapable prison of void? Amidst all these, there was the subject of growing up, of being conscious of the world, of the surroundings, of the people around you, of yourself and of other discoveries; and whether being conscious should be suppressed or one should break free from the dictates of the Church? The Amber Spyglass is a story that puts our faith into another perspective and our religious beliefs into a series of questions. All these told through a fantastical journey of an epic battle brought about by armored bears, Gallivespians, witch clans, rebel angels, the forces of the Church, Spectres, Souls of the dead and ordinary people... all fighting to either destroy or save God and His Kingdom of Heaven.<br />To determine the outcome of that battle, Lyra, who had been prophesized as the reincarnation of Eve, must undertake the test--the one that had been the downfall of the Mother of All--in the form of Will Parry.  And this is the part where I cried because I couldn't bear the pain of seeing Lyra and Will deciding that they must part ways in order to create the Republic of Heaven.  It was bittersweet because you can feel in your heart how they love each other and yet, they must set aside their feelings for the salvation of the world. Lyra succeeds in fighting the temptation at the cost of losing Will but it meant that consciousness or Dust will be saved. I take my hat off for these two heroic souls who had shown outstanding maturity and bravery despite their ages.<br /><br />Furthermore, aside from the central plot, there were other bits and pieces that I loved about this book. First, the corruption and brutality of the Church was a controversial one and it did make me wonder whether Philip was trying to tell us something about the real Church? Second, Philip's portrayal of the world of the dead really intrigued me because being a believer; it did open my mind to a lot of possibilities. And lastly, Mrs. Coulter's and Asriel's deed of bravery was just so unexpected that I was quite speechless. The power of redemptive love is just way tooo amazing.<br /><br />I would have given this book a five if only:<br /><br />1. Philip did not give lengthy descriptions about this and that. There were times that a page seemed to drag like forever.<br />The Amber Spyglass, for me, was not an apt title for the book since it didn't really play a significant role as compared to the subtle knife or the alethiometer.<br /><br />2. Philip failed to put a dramatic bit about Lyra's feelings towards her parents' death. I think that was a loose end because the book shouldn't have ended without Lyra knowing the sacrifices her parents had made and whether she mourned or forgave them afterwards.<br /><br />3.Philip took an effort to have the other significant characters play a more important role rather than appearing at the end of the book to fetch Lyra and Will. I am referring to the gyptians of course. The way they were mentioned in the book was like their presence was just inserted in an attempt to make us remember that they're still alive and kicking. It wasn't so subtle.<br /><br />4. If Philip found a way to give Lyra and Will the smallest chance of a happily ever after... like being together once in a while.<br /><br />In an overall note, the Amber Spyglass is an enticing read that will challenge your faith and at the same time teaching a thing or two about the struggles of growing up.  A must read for all fantasy lovers out there who wanted to explore an unrivalled story of fiction woven with realistic elements..<br /><br />I would have given this book a five if only:<br /><br />1.

B00DHNBPA6|5.0|My family and I have always enjoyed the Evil Dead movies and thsi one was a great addition to the Evil Dead line.
1451696191|2.0|Before anything else, I'd like to inform you that the sole reason I've read this book is that it was sent to me by my sister as a surprise gift--it wasn't my birthday though--and I don't have the heart to ignore it knowing that she paid a significant amount for its shipping.<br /><br />I don't have any problem reading epistolary novels. In fact, Daddy Long Legs and the Diary of a Wimpy Kid are favorites of mine.  But this book, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, has made it into my list of most hated books for 2013. I don't care if it has been made into a movie or Emma Watson was the star.  It was dry and dismal... absolutely unconvincing about the coming-of-age thingy. You wanna know why? Read on, bloggy friends.<br /><br />So we are introduced to the life of Charlie and how he came out of his shell when he befriended a senior named Patrick and eventually, the latter's sister, Sam. And then Charlie saw the world of how it is being in high school with the wild parties, drug use, premarital sex, violence, and shallow relationships. In the middle of these experiences, Charlie is also keeping a dark secret of his childhood which has left him traumatized until his high school years.<br /><br />So okay, I did understand what Stephen is trying to convey in this book.  What I can't understand is that why did he title this one as the perks of being a wallflower? I've read the whole book and I'm sorry if I sound like blabbering imbecile but I didn't see what kind perks Charlie got after being a wallflower.  The whole story just failed to connect to the title.<br /><br />And there were the characters that were as boring as our old chopping board.  Charlie was the most annoying of all. He seemed detached, clueless, naïve...a sort of person who was born yesterday. His teacher was all praises for him... being smart and all that.  I can't just get it because Charlie wasn't smart at all... he likes reading and yet, it's as if he's not learning from all the books that he read with the way he's acting. For goodness sake, he's 15 years old but Stephen depicts him like an eight year old kid. He is even confused on how to handle his relationship with Mary Elizabeth like he completely had no idea on why he was in that kind of situation at all. Whatever. It turned out later that he's a troubled kid after suffering from an abuse when he was a child. But that's exactly my point, how can he act so naïve when he had experienced firsthand the ugliness of human nature? I would really like to dissect Charlie's character in this review but I think that would give too many spoilers.<br /><br />Aside from the wild parties, etc. that I've mentioned in the second paragraph, TPBW also included rape and gay relationships creating an enchilada of human ugliness.  While I do appreciate those things being the subject of some books, I can't bring myself to like this book for that.  Clueless Stephen went throwing all those ingredients without thoroughly blending it with the whole story.  It made the book one-sided. It did not delve into why or how the other teenagers got into that kind of mess. To put it simply, it was superficial and a mockery to those people who experienced being in those situations.  Stephen definitely poked his nose into a subject matter that he clearly does not understand.  Otherwise, he would have written this book with great cautiousness.<br /><br />Stephen's manner of writing TPBW was also mediocre which failed to transport me into the hellish world of teenage chaos. It was even very monotonous using the same words over and over again which is somewhat unbelievable if you think of Charlie being \\"a wide reader.\\" It lacked the right emotion and the X-factor to keep the readers aching for more.<br /><br />As much as I would like waste my time to write a novella review for this book, I don't think I could go on.  TPBW has already used up a significant amount of my time with me reading it. There's no way I'd spend that much for writing a review for this joke of a book. Enough is enough. Would I recommend this book? Sure, if you think being extremely annoyed is the perfect way to spend a glorious day.r this joke of a book. Enough is enough. Would I recommend this book?

B009DH2PP4|5.0|This book got me going. Tons of information on brewing to get you started as well. The history and anecdotes are welcomed. Very easy and fun to read. The images look great on tablet screen but I don't read this book on my kindle so I can comment on the e-ink resolution. No information about kegging. Great recommendations on further reading on most topics. Still re-reading and will use this book as a resource in the future.
0142410373|4.0|I don't know about you but my Y/A years have been in a way shaped by Roald Dahl and his stories. Roald Dahl may have come late into my life--with me preferring to spend my childhood playing under the sun rather than read book indoors--but they never failed to remind me of the importance of goodness and that unpleasant deeds would always reap retribution either directly or indirectly.  And this perhaps is best conveyed by Roald Dahl's Matilda.<br /><br />The story of Matilda brings us to the lives of the Wormwood family members who--except for Matilda--were not only crooked but cruel as well. Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood were so immersed in their world of crookedness that they failed to see that they have been blessed with a gifted child, Matilda.  Instead of praising Matilda's feat of brilliance, they thought that she was an ignorant little twit. And as if the gods are conspiring against her, Matilda's headmistress--the Trunchbull--at school was ten times more horrible and whose favorite plaything were kids. Matilda must rise up to the challenge and get rid of the Trunchbull for good.<br /><br />While full of engaging and humorous scenes, Matilda is an honest story about the two faces of human nature, the good and the bad. The early chapters gave us a clear picture that cruelty starts at home. Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood's refusal or more likely ignorance of Matilda's gift and chastising her for being an annoying chatterbox are already tantamount to child abuse. And this became even clearer when they decided to leave Matilda behind without a qualm. Then there's the ugly side of leadership represented by the menacing Trunchbull who was not only a usurper but a big time bully as well who will definitely ruin a kid's childhood.<br /><br />On the other hand, despite growing up in a dysfunctional household, Matilda remained pure and rose from the baser nature of human ugliness.  Her principle as a young girl is no mean feat as she refused to be corrupted by her parents' shady ways. Instead, she assertively took actions to ensure that the bullies got their own dose of medicine. Matilda's ingenuity, courage and compassion are the things that really draw me to it.  The laughter and the fluffiness were just an added bonus.nstead, she assertively took actions to ensure that the bullies got their own dose of medicine.

0240815807|3.0|I don't know why this book receives such high marks, as the material is blandly presented and annoyingly paced. In fact, the author makes a point to fill many introductory paragraphs with yards of verbiage to \\"prepare\\" the reader for something that doesn't require the hype, and then spends much too long trying to drive home a very simple point by walking cleanly around it. His \\"cut to the chase\\" sections at the end of each chapter include only the most obvious information, so it's just more text to slog through as you search for missing insights.<br /><br />The information within the book is very valuable, but you have to pry it from mounds of useless words. It's barely useful as a reference with all the \\"personality\\" fat injected between all the points of interest, so expect a long, boring journey through the work of an author who knows what they're talking about, but not how to put it to text.
014241039X|4.0|Did I ever mention that Roald Dahl had been a favorite author of mine ever since Matilda? If not, then I am telling you now that I am.  For the past couple of months, I've already published reviews about the two books written by him, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and The Witches. Today, I am back with another book of Roald Dahl which have made a straightforward impression on me as a growing individual.  Why? Read on, pals!<br /><br />The Twits is a humorous story of a vindictive and dysfunctional couple, Mr. and Mrs. Twit. They're childless which apparently suits them right for I can't imagine someone growing up with that kind of parents. Mrs. Twit, who had been pretty once, succumbed to the level of hideously ugly after thinking of horrible thoughts over time. While Mr. Twit is a horrible person whose love for hygiene and sanitation is nil.  With these similarities in personality, you would have thought that they made the perfect match but surprise, surprise...apart from getting fun out of mistreating their pet monkeys, Mr. and Mrs. Twit absolutely revel in playing sick jokes against each other.<br /><br />On the surface, the story of the Twits, with its absurd humor and cracked up characters, is a perfect break from the usual monotony of a day's work.  It carries Roald Dahl's brand of bringing scenes into vibrant pictures of outrageousness. Mr and Mrs Twits' jokes might be sick but they were authentically appealing. I certainly read it with relish not that I am sadistic but I just can't help laughing my heart out.<br /><br />On a deeper level, The Twits is not just about cruel jokes but it gives us insight to the other facet of human nature...cruelty to animals and children, the damaging effects of bad disposition and karma.  While I enjoy the scenes of the Twits complemented with illustrations, I was also moved with the lessons that it conveyed especially the subject of karma.<br /><br />The Twits, for its sheer fun and creativity knitted with important life lessons, deserves a read from audiences of different ages.lessons, deserves a read from audiences of different ages.

B00CSCJ09K|5.0|I had never heard of David Garrett until I saw his concert on PBS during Fund Week in August, 2013. I was captivated the moment he started to play. I watched the concert seven times that week. The CD Music is based on that concert. I checked him out on Amazon and bought this CD and two others thereby eliminating P&H. The CD is not completely true to the concert, the Bond music, the Beatles and Corelli are absent but other pieces are as good. Half the CD is classical - if not exactly traditional, and the rest transitional. He plays brilliantly with passion and speed. I was exposed to classical music growing up but never realized a violin could sound so beautiful.

0307476073|1.0|This book deserves less than one star. Written by a woman so self-indulgent, whiny, promiscuous, lacking a moral compass of any kind, impulsive, reckless, overly dramatic, and ill adjusted that you will be sick to your stomach. She lives in la-la land and blames anyone but herself for living based off her emotions.<br />This book is a \\"memoir\\" on events that happened in 1995, never once quoting her over-sized and heavy journal she took with her. The details she gives are simply unbelievable.<br />Her mom dies and she plunges herself in her own little grief world and makes that her excuse to commit depraved things:<br />Lets her beloved horse starve and go uncared for and instead of humanely putting it down by a veterinarian, has a botched execution graphically portraying this horse's misery. She trys to paint this picture that she's showing sympathy for the horse by having it killed by people it knows....what she did was criminal.<br />Destroys her marriage by sleeping around with other men claiming she is \\"still in love with her husband.\\"<br />Delves in hardcore drugs (heroine).<br />She aborts her bastard child she has with a heroine addict and is unremorseful.<br />She eats her mom's ashes because \\"she wasn't ready to part with her.\\"<br /><br />On a whim, without any real preparation, decides she's going to hike the PCT. Ooh, she sees a bear and a few rattlesnakes. And because she didn't take her husband's advice and try out her boots before leaving, loses 6 toenails. The prologue that hooks you is she loses a boot off a cliff. When you come to that part in the book, it isn't dramatic at all, you learn she has other boots waiting for her at the next stop.<br /><br />There's no relating to this author, she cannot take her head out of her ass for ten seconds and she's 26 at the time. Grown woman blaming her marriage's destruction on being too young and naive. Nope, she just gave in, shut down and became even more self absorbed. Her mother and her husband catered tothis indulgence, one out of wanting to keep her around and the other out of naivety. He should have sent her to hell, IMHO. Not getting a tattoo celebrating their divorce.<br /><br />This book is a complete waste of time, I was hoping for a Pacific Crest Trail story, what I got was a stupid girl with stupid thoughts pity partying the entire time, she didn't even hike the whole thing! She hitchhiked more often than not.

0525423842|4.0|MINOR SPOILERS:<br /><br />Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer is a good book. It's not amazing, though. It tells you the story of a boy who sets out to find the REAL culprit of a murder case.<br /><br />Theodore, A 13 year old boy, is a lawyer. Well, not really. But, his parents are. From that he knows everything he needs to about law. He even gets his class a trip to a big trial. During that trial, Theodore and his class learn about a recent murder case. Theodore knows the suspect is lying, but he doesn't have the evidence to prove it. So, Theodore sets out to find evidence that proves the suspect did it.<br /><br />This book was somewhat entertaining, but didn't have much action at all. The end was practically yelling for a sequel. I found this book to be a bit boring because of the sections where they lecture you about law.

B003JTHWJQ|4.0|I think that it may sway those that want to give up on religion and assure those that already have, since this book is above all polemical; a reasoned attack on the truth and value of religion. The book gives the impression that the author is addressing the reader directly perhaps partly because he read it aloud twice to his wife (of Dr. Who fame) and because some of it is from speeches he has given (which can be viewed on YouTube).<br /><br />First of all I should admit am myself a bit of a Buddhist, deist or even theist in some ways (the latter from an \\"other power Buddhist\\" standpoint). Despite this fact I found myself in agreement with a lot of what Dawkins had to say, especially towards the end.<br /><br />My greatest disappointment was that he appeared to be as convinced of the preposterousness of religion as those that believe in it are of its verity, and so did not do as much as I would have preferred to explore the middle ground. Particularly glaring omissions in this regard were the lack of a discussion of the evolution of religion. This gets only a brief mention towards the end. It is as if he does not want to sully his preferred faith - evolution - with having created that which he seems to despise so much. But assuming Darwin and Dawkins are right (as I do), then religion clearly evolved allowing, as he mentions in the specific case of his institution New College Cambridge, for people such as him self the means and leisure to as it were, destroy their own foundations.<br /><br />The other glaring omission from my point of view was that, despite the wealth of literature outside his own field he was prepared to read when it supported the atheistic case, he made little mention of what might be called scientific theories of god other than that of Julian Jaynes. Particularly with reference to \\"imaginary friends,\\" he only quotes Jaynes and a fiction author, whereas he was clearly at least dimly aware of other theories of \\"imaginary friends,\\" or intra-psychicothers.<br /><br />These include, with varying degrees of scientific-ness, Adam Smith's \\"impartial spectator,\\" Freud's Superego, Bakhtin's \\"super-addressee,\\" Jung's \\"Animus\\", George Herbert Mead's \\"Generalised Other,\\" Jacque Lacan's \\"Other,\\" and Hermans & Kempen's intra-psychic others (based upon the work of Bakhtin). Dawkins discusses the possibility that \\"imaginary friends\\" may be needed to console humans -- needed in an emotional way. He does not however seem to include the possibility that that they may be needed to sustain the existence or believe in self - a far stronger possibility, argued by most of the above authors. I would particularly recommend George Herbert Mead and Bakhtin for fairly down to earth renditions of the need for an other in mind to support self cognition.<br /><br />To what extent to we need interlocutors, and is it sufficient that they all be external? Dawkins has a wide public, and as already mentioned, a very accommodating wife, but does he need or believe in anyone else, anyone in his mind to listen? I suggest that he does since he mentions (in one the several places that he states he was moved) by the words of Jefferson who recommends that we run everything by our \\"reason\\" who Jefferson personifies as a she.<br /><br />Finally towards the end, Dawkins says many thing with which I would agree, particularly that we have a model of our world that is quite limited but I would refute that this model is \\"inside our head\\" as Dawkins states, since our head is part of the model. He also claims that we have a very limited view of the world, which as an evolutionary biologist he should be painfully aware, being as we are in large part earth worm and even sharing much of our DNA with a banana. But despite being aware of our simplicity and insignificance he seems to think that somehow we can overcome it, know the constants of the universe, and looking out through our minuscule pin whole on the world we can somehow turn ourselves to see ourselves,to see everything. This strikes me as preposterous vanity.<br /><br />Planetary bacilli that we are, our model of the world is and will always be immeasurably more simple than that which - he seems to almost profess - we can not begin to imagine. And yet, and yet, we look out upon the world and believe that it is full of matter. Worse, we believe ourselves to be \\"Richard,\\" the model and not \\"head\\" or \\"little boy\\" that is pretending to be Richard. The author knew that he could not complete this loop on his own once apparently, but he has since forgotten.<br /><br />All this vitriol and forgetting makes me wonder whether his brush with Catholic Priest may not have been rather worse than \\"embarrassing.\\" Or perhaps he was traumatised by his surname an abbreviation of which in the UK is used to be school children to refer to fools and the male sex organ. Am I being nasty now? At times I found his book to be rather too aggressive to be motivated by the awe and wonder that he claims to feel towards science.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Every Sunday night it was Ed Sullivan & the Cartwright family. I watched in both amazement & dismay. Beatles were of course amazing but I don't think I ever saw my step father more outraged. I was afraid he would turn it off but much to my relief he settled down & rode it out. It is important that these shows continue to be available but if you already bought the version a few years back you probably don't need to buy it again unless like me your copy was lost or damaged. The only thing I would have liked would be to have the Beatles performances alone as well as the complete shows for the times you just can't stomach the entire show & want to just kick back & let it roll. Still anybody that loves the Beatles owes it to themself to ad this to their collection

0399159347|5.0|Very original, gripping and well-written. There is a lot of insight on several relationships of the people whose destinies interlock in the storyline. One of the books that you are sorry to finish. You would like to see how things develop for each of the characters, and if the power of forgiveness (ultimately one of the central themes) makes their relationships last.
B0070R40V6|4.0|I'm not going to review the book, because if you have not heard of it by now, you have your eyes shut and your hands over your ears. The world is so complex and vibrant that the enhanced edition really makes for a multi-layered experience. By tapping on various words or icons you can look up who's who in Westeros or listen to a narration of the text. Definitely a more involved experience.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It's cheesy one-liner, contrived story line, in your face action.

If you expect something groundbreaking or good dialogue and character development, then why did you click watch now after reading the plot summary :)

B00AQMQBKK|3.0|I enjoyed this game at first because of how well it translated the board game. But then in later levels, the game becomes obscenely difficult. I don't mind getting killed because I got screwed on a doom counter or bested on a challenge. But when my entire party wipes simply because a particular rune doesn't show up for sixteen turns straight, that kind of takes the fun away.<br />A way to make the game more palatable would be if there were a mode that didn't use the shops as a turn.<br />These are a few ideas. Then you would have a fun game with multiple levels, instead of Yig or OH MY GOD MAKE THE HURTING STOP. ;-)

1401207529|5.0|You know the classics of literature - War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, Middlemarch? There are aspects to them to appreciate and patient readers can be rewarded greatly with those books. But let's be honest - most of us view classics as a bit of a chore. But what about classic comics? Kind of the same thing, but not for so many. Some classic comics, Marvel and DC especially, are tough to read because the stories from the 40s and 50s are so badly written and cheesy, and the art is hit or miss, though most of them possess a guileless charm to them that makes them easier to stomach. When it comes to comics, no character stands taller than Batman, and no Batman book has more of a reputation than Year One. Is it a chore to read? No. Has it aged poorly? Not even a bit. Does it deserve it's title as a true bona fide classic? (Austin Powers voice) Yeah, baby!<br /><br />Year One is Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli's retelling of Batman's origin and through their retelling they set the tone and standard for all other Batman books that followed. A 25 year old Bruce Wayne returns to a nightmarish Gotham City riddled with crime at the same time as an older but still young James Gordon, recently transferred to the GCPD and entering Gotham City for the first time. Both men have a clear mission: to clean up the streets of crime and make Gotham habitable for decent, hardworking folks.<br /><br />Some readers have wondered why Gordon gets as much space - maybe more - as Bruce Wayne in this book and the answer is simple: they're both two sides of the same coin. The very first Batman story opens with Bruce and Jim sitting, talking about crime, and Jim is arguably Batman's best friend. Batman's origin would tie in with Gordon's as their lives will be linked forever once they dig their heels in and bring justice to Gotham.<br /><br />It's been a few years since I read Year One and I really hoped it would hold up - and it did. Whatever your feelings are about Frank Miller today (and he has unfortunately gone from genius writer to crackpot old man), his work in the 80s ranks amongst the best the comics medium has ever produced, and Year One is arguably the pinnacle of that work. He went from telling the last Batman story ever with The Dark Knight Returns to, with his next book, going back to the very beginning and telling the first Batman story ever - and both are masterpieces.<br /><br />In just four issues, we see Bruce get into his first fight as an unmasked vigilante, to realising he must don a disguise, to the famous \\"Yes. Father. I will become a bat\\" scene, to his fledgling first missions to clear up corrupt police, mob bosses, and the iconic dinner party scene where he appears to Gotham's most powerful and evil to inform them they have eaten well but from now on none of them are safe. And the scene when Batman takes down the SWAT team? Brilliant. Still tense, exciting, and fantastic to read.<br /><br />It's a testament to Miller's writing that he's able to take Gordon, who for many is little more than a one-note background character, and makes you care about him as much as you do Batman. Gordon becomes Gotham's first non-corrupt officer, fighting his own colleagues (literally and figuratively) to uphold the law and become better than the criminals they chase, while his wife is pregnant with James Jr. (see Batman: The Black Mirror for what happened to James Jr. when he grew up) and the stresses of the job leading to him make some bad decisions.<br /><br />We also meet Selina Kyle for the first time, working as a dominatrix in Gotham's red light district, as she decides to become her own costumed character, Catwoman, after first seeing Batman. Mazzuchelli's art in this book is flawless but my one criticism of the book is Catwoman's outfit - I hate the whiskers and tail! What use are either to a cat burglar? And it just looks stupid.<br /><br />Anyway, Year One is a must-read for all Batman fans - as if you didn't already know! Everyone whohas even a cursory knowledge of Batman comics knows Year One is one of the first to read. And it is - but it's also one to re-read and come back to again and again because there are a LOT of Batman books, but few of such high quality as Year One. A great beginning for the Dark Knight and the man who would be Commissioner. Just don't read Year Two!has even a cursory knowledge of Batman comics knows Year One is one of the first to read.

B00DCP0082|4.0|Annihilator has always been one of my favorite bands. Seeing the fact no one knows them in the metal word is disappointing so hopefully this review will shine some light on this obscure band from Canada. 2013's \\"Feast\\" isn't the best album of all time, but it is a great surprise. At times it may be inconsistent but somehow, Jeff Waters makes it work.<br /><br />\\"Deadlock\\" is an old school speed metal track reminiscent of the old Alice In Hell days. The bass work is audible and the drums are powerful. Water's solo is good (as always) \\"No Way Out\\" Strange intro, but it builds steam and releases yet again another thrashterpiece of a song. The opening solo is great. The lyrics are thought provoking. Quite possibly the best song on the album. \\"Smear Campaign\\" Good head banging track. It gives your neck a break after the opening two tracks. \\"No Surrender\\" A jazzy bass intro starts things off (like an old Megadeth feel) The main riff is something you would hear from King Of The Kill (I love that). \\"Wrapped\\" NWOBHM intro. Incredibly old school. The low point of this track, lyrics are corny and popish. \\"Perfect Angel Eyes\\" Intro will remind the listener of something from Never Neverland. I will say I do like this song, the lyrics are strange especially for a metal band and for Annihilator but Jeff's guitar work makes it stick somehow. \\"Demon Code\\" Return the thrash. Highlight of the album, the lyrics deal with insanity, demons etc. Riffs are melodic and catchy and the main riff causes me to destroy random objects around town when I drive. \\"Fight The World\\" another hauntingly beautiful intro. Depressing with intricate bass work. The drum kit is demolished in the making of this track. The solo is killer. \\"One fall, Two Rise\\" Another melodic intro. Then will pick up to become a testosterone fueled thrash song.<br /><br />Overall, Annihilator has managed to release an album that surpasses the last one and (in my mind, ranks up in their top 5) Not saying that \\"Feast\\" is better than the classics as the lead singer is weak compared to the likes of the older guys. But he does manage to carry the weight of this technical thrash juggernaut of a band. Jeff has proven that time only increases his guitar mastership. And we also have an impressive showing from Mike Harshaw, the new fella on the drum kit.

B0049JPU8A|5.0|I've listened to this album upwards of two dozen times. It's probably the best pop album since the days of Foreigner or Boston's debut albums. This is unbelievably great pop unlike the current crop of Maroon Five or One Republic and their ilk where you have a couple of good singles mixed up with a load of mediocrity. This is a true album the way albums are supposed to be, start to finish just fantastic. We older folk who grew up in the seventies still like to sit down and put a record on and listen to a full set of songs from one artist without cringing. I can't sit back and listen to Maroon Five's latest even though I like a few of the songs. I can't listen to The Script's debut, either, but this is CLASSIC!
0307719774|4.0|I really like this journal, I like the prompts that it gives and I am excited to have this as a time capsule of 5 years of my life. It's such a cool idea! However...<br /><br />It's tiny! It's way smaller than I thought it would be. It's just smaller than my hand (if i put the heel of my palm on the bottom I can curl the top knuckle of my middle finger over the top. I have piano fingers but still). So that was a bit surprising but okay, it's easier to carry in a purse or something.<br /><br />I was definitely expecting 365*5 questions with a page for each answer, but it's 365 questions with 5 spots to write your answer. The spaces are 4 lines long. Not very much space to write.<br /><br />I really wish it were the size of a regular book, so that I could have more space to write in it. My handwriting suffers because it feels so cramped, and I hate not being able to get all my ideas on to the page.<br /><br />It's a very nice looking book and a fabulous idea but those things were a real bummer to me.

1250012570|5.0|This is one of those oh too rare books that you never, ever want to end.  In fact, towards the end, I found myself rationing out the ending pages as I knew it would soon be time to say goodbye!<br /><br />Set in 1986 (my coming of age era), I immediately related to the awkwardness, the quirkiness and ultimately the serendipity when things come together the way they should.  Full of witty dialogue, relevant cultural references and believable angst, teenage and otherwise, this book rings genuine on a number of levels.  I originally bought this so that my middle-schooler would have it on his shelf when he needed a book for an English assignment, but I quickly over-rode that need and grabbed it for my own.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell has a voice that rings true with absolutely no feeling of artificiality or sentimentality.  As two eccentric teenagers bumble their way through life, school and finding their first love, we are taken on a variety of adventures back through the difficult high school years.  I could literally smell my old school in some of the passages! I also literally re-experienced some of my awkward adolescence through some of the passages.<br /><br />With no spoilers here, let me tell you I was absolutely delighted with the way it ended.  It could have gone in so many different directions, and the author chose perfectly!  I can't wait for her next book and am going to pick up her first, Attachments, as soon as I can.

B006IDG2T6|2.0|I thought it was a very weird introduction.  Somehow gross.  I got the impression that it created an excuse for people who lack mental control and protects adhering to good values which are necessary for good societal behavior.  It also provides poor role modeling for our youths especially at a time and season of school shootings.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is fun, but time consuming.  I am not fond of games that make you have friends to progress. There is a lot of push to make you buy gems as well making some goals near impossible to complete without paying money for them. I understand that the need to make money too, but a free game should be free to play too.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The story was different to my normal choice of books. It piqued my interest because of the approach it took to a relationship between the two main characters. I became caught up in trying to work out actually what was going on! I did not like the characters very much but at the same time I was fascinated and had to keep reading. There were particular aspects of the book that struck a chord with me as the book unfolded. The question ' How much do we really know about the person we live with  ?' It  made me think about my relationship and others I know. It was thought provoking. As the story built to its climax I found aspects of it terrifying. I believe that there is an assumption in society, in general, that if you have done nothing wrong in life that contravenes the law, you will not be a suspect or assumed guilty by the police. However, as recent high profile cases have proven in the UK and this story explores, beware that assumption and its consequences.  A thriller that challenges and explores the minds of the the two main characters which , although not likeable in my opinion, I found i had to read to the end to find out what happens. For me a surprise, even though I kept picking up clues that did sign post me to the conclusion. A Tad long in places but I am glad I kept reading! A good read.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't read YA novels as a general rule.  I tried a different popular YA love story novel for a book group and was infuriated at the lack of true introspection and the stagnant dialogue.  The Fault in our Stars is another book group pick, and I will admit that I groaned when I heard the subject, expecting a cancer story that shied away from adult topics to \\"spare\\" teens.<br /><br />Teenagers are smarter than we give them credit for, and this novel has renewed my faith in YA fiction.  At first the dialogue seemed a little accelerated, but I would much rather read a book with very clever (or \\"too\\" clever) characters than flat dialogue from unintelligent characters.
0399215921|5.0|My one-year-old son reaches for this book again and again - he loves all the animal noises and we also make some ASL signs to go along.  But most fun of all is making the \\"pesky fly\\" real with sound effects and gestures.  He grabs and swats at the fly on the same page that the spider catches it in her new web.  He understands that at the end of the book the spider has done everyone a favor by catching the fly.  This book is great because it doesn't underestimate what such young children can comprehend.  My son notices spiders and webs outdoors now and points them out to me!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can You Escape is an interesting game.  You use logic thinking skills and it challenges your brain to think more.
0399226907|5.0|My one-year-old son reaches for Eric Carle's \\"Very Busy Spider\\" again and again but he is coming to really enjoy this one as well.  He is still a little too young to understand that the butterfly IS the caterpillar from the previous pages but he loves counting the fruits eaten and especially loves the page with all the other foods.  This book is one he will enjoy for many more months especially after he has a better understanding of the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush is a fun game. My two year old nephew love to play this game all the time.
1609613937|5.0|The most encouraging writing to stay on such a sensible eating plan (for life!) and I've shared it with many others
B002361MLA|5.0|Put him to the test. I speak only for myself, of course, and with saying that I offer the small suggestion that you read it, couple it with his Youtube meditations, breathe in the freedom, and smile with joy as you recognize that with baby steps you are becoming the observer. Or not, it depends on where each of us is as we wander in around in this forest of magnificent Redwoods and decide which one we want to climb. It's all OK. Eventually, maybe  ...
B00CXQL828|5.0|this is a great combination for mr.big, dream theater and RK fans!<br />all is as expected.thx amazon!<br />looking forward to next order.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I have yet had time to listen to the Concert For George but I am looking forward to hearing it. Thanks for having it!
B004SKHJF2|3.0|The overall UI of the app seems extremely outdated (Gingerbread standards). Also there are no goodies like lyrics/Live Lyrics as there are in SoundHound!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|A different view of the same reality makes you see some things different. Easy to read and straight forward. Helps build a wider picture.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs. All have come fast and when they said they would come.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Very addicting fun game.  It is hard to figure out your strategy because you are constantly upgrading and changing your driving ability.  It is easy to pick up and play without a lot of rules.  Cute simple graphics but runs smoothly on my Kindle fire.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This drew me in immediately. I wish a few of the other characters had been explored more but other than that I really enjoyed the trip.
B006PAV1XO|4.0|I liked it because it had subtle humor moments that kept me laughing for the majority of the film. Enjoy
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is amazing. Reminds me of SimCity and rollercoaster tycoon. And it's free can't beat that. I wish it was easier to get investor tickets that's why I gave it 4 stars
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Still one of my favorites after so many years, had a good movie night with the wife. Would rent again.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I read the books some time ago and had heard of the tv series.  I finally decided to watch the first one and was hooked.  Good show.
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this because i can talk to my friends and people you may never get to see or just wanna talk about anything
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This story ,about WW2 may have happened or not but keeps a reader wanting to see the end. Good read.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|The kids say: Very well made movie, with an engaging plot - very Spielberg. The animation was amazing. The story was a little confusing for those who are not already familiar with Tintin.
0385528787|4.0|The final book in the \\"MaddAddam\\" trilogy merges Oryx and Crake with the Year of the Flood in both style and storyline. Here Toby, Amanda, and Ren have joined a colony of the surviving God's Gardeners, bringing with them an unconscious Jimmy and his Craker followers. The present sections largely follow the point of view of Toby, who must now take up Jimmy's position as official storyteller and preacher to the Crakers.<br /><br />The sermons and present day sections are interspersed with the story of Zeb, Toby's lover and God's Gardeners strongman. Zeb's story connects nearly every plot thread and character, and explains the origin of God's Gardeners, the plague \\"flood\\", and even how the group knew to prepare for this coming catastrophe. There's also a few new things added to Atwood's world of unchecked corporations, including a bizarre church that tries to use Christianity to justify fossil fuel consumption.<br /><br />This was definitely a satisfying conclusion, wrapping both books together and closing all loose ends of the story, although there's definitely room for future installments. There's also an amusing new character, a curious little Cracker boy named Blackbeard, who latches onto a somewhat exasperated Toby. Maddaddam is a good book and a better read than Year of the Flood, even strengthening the previous installment.<br /><br />A review copy was provided by the publisher.
B006IND5M8|3.0|I was intrigued by the trailer of this movie, but missed it at the theaters and kept forgetting to watch it.  Finally remembered this weekend and was a bit disappointed.  Maybe it was my fault for how I'd envisioned what line the plot would follow and I was not close.<br />Of course it could have been the script that was disappointing (that's my guess).<br /><br />Casting was good and the actors seemed to execute exactly what the script requested.  However, to me, the script was sort of half-hearted and did not do a good enough job of explaining much about the aliens or exploring how the people of late 1800's would react to flying vehicles and aliens.  The script seemed to be trying too hard to capture the feel of the old westerns while pulling off a sci-fi movie at the same time and it was difficult for the two to co-exist.<br /><br />Probably the most interesting thing about the movie was that Clancy Brown was in it and I'd heard him voice Lex Luther in most of the DC animated T.V. series but never seen him acting in anything.  He was very smooth and comfortable in his role.  Good voice and best Lex Luther voice ever.<br /><br />If you like Daniel Craig and/or Harrison Ford (who probably had the best role in the movie), then this is worth watching; otherwise, it's a bit of a toss up.  Just don't over-expect and you should be fine.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It was a good movie.  I usually do not like Tom Curise by I have to say it was good.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game makes your feelings more strong than ever. And you never need to take off your eyes by your phone. Your life will never be the same!
B004LWZW24|5.0|My movie arrived in great shape, fast also. i enjoyed viewing now i must see chapter two. the company i ordered from got it to me on time i give them 100 thanks much. if you order this movie be prepared to want to see chapter 2
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|One of the absolute best movies out there! It's also not easy to find, I am very happy with it!
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|I am a huge fan if this band. I am listening to the album now. This album sounds good. You should buy the album. You will enjoy it. Good job NIN.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The best single word to describe this book is `cool.' It is written in that hip, terse, detached style that speaks to the reader's inner coolness. You just want to be the main character, to act like him, talk like him and sound like him. I read the book twice. The author can really write. I can't wait for the next book `Operation Parsifal.'
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was beautifully written. It's almost like a fairytale with all of its imaginings. The story seems to have many levels childhood fears and adult thoughts. There are some wonderful heroines they are magical...I couldn't put this book down.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|This device seems to be pretty accurate on the steps, heart rate, sleep.  The only place it falls short is on other activity like weigh lifting.  It just can't give an accurate calorie burn, but the only device that can is the heart rate monitor.  The problem with the heart rate monitor is that it doens't sync with any other apps.  I have been using this device for just about exactly one month and the clip case is already starting to tear in the corner.  I fear the device will fall out.  I am going to try contacting Withings and see if I can get a replacement.  At any rate, I like the device, but I fear that it will end up in the wash.
0425263908|5.0|It was awesome.  Great trilogy. Can't wait to read 4th book.  Think it had better story line that 50 shades!!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I threw this on for the hell of it. And I gotta say, it was quite good. Not a blockbuster triple A title but quite worth watching for a light evening.
140006922X|5.0|I would recommend it to everyone.It helps to explain and illucidate  all the events of the day.<br />Buy it today.
1451683405|1.0|I suggest readers instead explore Dennett's \\"Intuition Pumps\\", after which the flaws in Harris's logic jump right off the page.<br />But don't let this put you off Harris's \\"The End of Faith\\", where he writes with much more compelling judgment, not to mention highly elegant prose!
0307743721|5.0|It's a collection of stories about situations in life and relationships.  Each ends with an open interpretation, which is the fascinating part.  Some people didn't like this book.  For example, one reader thought the main character in the story \\"Train\\" was just a loner running away from relationships.  The question is why he was running away.  The answer is in the story!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is not the entire facebook page, it contains only the mobile app of it which is exactly like what I have on my iPhone.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The addiction started with Season 1 and carries through Season 3 with a vengeance.  I breathed a sigh of relief when Season 4 hit &#34;Prime&#34; this week.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A predictable, smutty read.  It's not hard to figure out where this is heading when you start reading it, but it's alright.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is such a fun game and it's great to see your stickman come to life that you draw. I had fun drawing kooky weapons as well. I was sad when I beat the game so I hope they make another!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I truly enjoyed the characters and the flow of the plot, a very good balance of description and action. I'm looking forward to more from Mr. Ryan!
0321934318|5.0|I love Kelby's style of instruction.  He gets down to the nuts and bolts, discards the theories and tells you what you need to do to achieve the effect you want.  I am new to Lightroom, having a great deal of experience with Photoshop.  I see the writing on the wall with Adobe's Creative Cloud where the casual photographer will eventually be priced out of the game.  I decided that I had better get comfortable with Lightroom and turned to Kelby for the way to get up to speed.  I haven't regretted my decision.
B005USZYDU|3.0|This book way crazy yet satisfying because everything came out of no where and really why would a kid want to be a lawyer that what I thought of this book
B00AALHW6Y|3.0|I LOVE Darius Rucker's voice, but some of the songs fall flat and aren't up to his abilities.  Was excited about &#34;Wagon Wheel&#34;, but it's too smooth and polished.  The song is better on the rough side.  Do better next time Darius!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|The set arrived very quickly and seems to be in perfect condition.  Since it will be a future gift it hasn't been opened yet.
B00B19H2KU|4.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Totally scary and way creepy. If you like scary, you'll like this one.
B00338QENI|5.0|An amazing true story, and well written.  So sad it took so long for her family to hear the truth.
B005HEPN06|5.0|What an amazing ensemblage of cast, storied crew, and denizens of plots!  Great work to watch!  I would but whole 7 Seasons!
B0014I4KH6|5.0|She loves this CD. She sings and dances to all the songs on this CD every day. Well worth the purchase.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun game easy good for all ages fun to pass time with fun to figure out with friends I recommend this game
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Excellent book following on from the BBC Doco &#34;Eat, Fast & Live&#34;. I am 5 weeks in & 5 kg down. Feeling sharper & more energetic. Look forward to the fast days every week.... wierd I know but true.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I thought the movie was great. You add the Rock to any franchise it turns results. Lady Jaye's outfits were a bonus.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is rad cool and fun I am going to give this five stars cant wait till I buy this. also might buy 2k14 cost 0.99 for kindle fire
B00COCY67A|4.0|It is good to have all the Stax recordings in one collection. It should have been done that way from the beginning. My only complaint is the various takes that were selected were not in order on the CD's to match the information in the booklet. Side note, some of the takes, were better than the master (background sound and voices - over produced). Good purchase.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|My husband loves superhero movies.  We both watched it and enjoyed it.  The ending caught us by surprise.  It wasn't what we'd thought it was going to be.  It was definitely a good movie to watch.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Amazing, fun, wholesome show. For the whole family! It is great that shows like this are available to watch. Loved it!
B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie was a hard sell for me.  I've always enjoyed mythology, but turning ancient God's into aliens was quite a leap.  However, the movie was well done and turned out very good.  We look forward to seeing the new Thor movie.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|I love this album. Emmy has a beautiful voice for singing music of this era. You won't be disappointed buying this album.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|according to my calculation I love it works great on ipad too also on other android devices God gave me a great game luv it<br />:)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this book, so sad that the movie come up really bad. I believe that Valentine did a wonderful comeback
B00ANGRQJY|5.0|Ecellent album.  Just came aware of this band and their music.  Excellent stuff here, where you can really get lost in the music.  5 stars
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun and incredibly addicting.  it's very easy to rank up without having to spend real money.  The slot games are very realistic.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed the story and I haven't read most of King 's books. The whole story of how a man travels back in time to change the course of history and the ensuing results leads to a truly adrenalin fueled adventure. It's a long book, but a short read. 5 stars!
B00DHHFKE4|4.0|This is an entertaining holiday read.  It kept me captivated while on the beach.<br />Interesting look into the women's prison system.<br />Enjoyable and easy.
B00CO8TA4I|4.0|Really fast processor. Coming from a Core2Duo on my laptop it's night and day. I just wish I could OC it. Although, I think it's plenty powerful as is.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Much better than the Stallone version. Gore gore gore! Not over the top at all. I might buy this title on blu-ray.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I only used one clip and I slide the flashlight from the top down..and it does a decent job holding it in. Using two clamps made it tough pulling it out against the wall.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book really takes you into the psychology of a boy with more responsibility than one can handle.  Throughout the course of the book you watch the innocence fade, paved over by cold reality and purpose.  Great read that can be accomplished in a day or two given the motivation.  The book itself can be treated as a standalone from the series so don't shy away if you feel like you'll need to read all five to understand the story.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I can't get the game to work on my kindle at all. Have tried everything I can think of to get it to work and no luck what so ever.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I thought this was a great read and I was surprised by some of the twists and turns the story took.  I was very disappointed in the ending though - I felt the author should have come down on one side or the other.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie of the old classic.  It was very artfully done and the music was fantastic!  I recommend this movie.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|The movie was very good. My daughter has watched it many times. The picture was very clear even on an old laptop.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Love Club EP is overall very good love her voice and I can't wait to hear more from the band
B00E193TM2|5.0|This is a awesome album very glad I purchesed it! Highly recomend to everyone.  Cant wait to learn all the badasss guitar parts !!
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|Do you like the Fog?  If so, BUY THIS!!!  It looks AMAZING on Blu-ray!  The movie hasn't looked any better than this and the extra interviews with John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis make this disc THE one to buy!  Scream Factory are GODS when it comes to horror releases and this one does not disappoint!
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I love every aspect of the movie and the purchase on Amazon Prime, but the credits music was.. not Iron Man.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|Season 4 of ST: TNG on Blu-ray is a must for any Trek fan.  The episodes are crystal clear...the menu is user friendly...the special features are PRIMO!!!  You'd be a Regulan Blood Worm NOT to purchase this awesome set!!!  Make it so!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|If you are reading this review, I can't help you. Start at the beginning. Read them all. If you make it this far, then you will buy this book. I waited years for the conclusion, you don't have to.<br /><br />It.<br />Is.<br />Epic.<br /><br />Remember to breathe.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am delighted to have this to study with. Especially<br />Having different versions of the bible. Easy to navigate around.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin's first book in this series is very well done. It leaves you scratching your head and anything that you think you know, you are probably wrong. There is an amazing amount of depth in this series and book one just scratches the surface. Read the book and you'll be hooked. It's not like every other fantasy out there where the good guys always win and the bad guys are the epitome of evil. It's real life, winners and losers, shades of good and evil.<br /><br />You'll find yourself loving, hating, loathing and pitying, and that's all on one character.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|I waited and waited for this album to be released and it is incredible.  Made Up Mind, from beginning to end...fantastic!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Martin's books in this series builds upon the story from book 1. Anything you learned from book one will be tested and you'll feel your heart clench as characters continue to develop. It's not like every other fantasy out there where the good guys always win and the bad guys are the epitome of evil. It's real life, winners and losers, shades of good and evil.<br /><br />You'll find yourself loving, hating, loathing and pitying, and that's all on one character.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Although I do like Mahjong, having ads in a paid app is just plain WRONG. These developers are getting out of control with the ads, greed, and total disrespect for their customers. I could also do without the cheesy cartoon screens in between each board. Now, as far as the game itself, it is decent, but I find it nearly impossible to overlook the outright disrespect of paying customers by placing ads in this app. Afterall, the main reason people get PAID APPS, is to AVOID ADS.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin's fifth book in this series is more of the same. It builds upon characters you think you know. There is an amazing amount of depth in this series and book five begins to reveal some of my favorite characters, especially Arya. It's not like every other fantasy out there where the good guys always win and the bad guys are the epitome of evil. It's real life, winners and losers, shades of good and evil.<br /><br />You'll find yourself loving, hating, loathing and pitying, and that's all on one character.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0063GORYU|3.0|Did you know the apple version can be bought to lose the ads? Feel like a second class android citizen.
B008Y5Q7SW|4.0|I Love it. Such a fun movie to watch. Better to watch 2nd & 3rd times to catch little nuances.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The script can be a little cheesy and/or predictable at times, but overall this is a great show to get into.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Honestly I had not thought much about North Korea.  In history class we learned a little bit but mostly this country was lumped in with other Communist countries and not much was known.<br />This book gave a personal view from a series of interviews with individuals.  I was able to see inside the lives of real people and it was very moving.<br />I am glad I read this.  A friend recommended this book and described the heart wrenching conflicts it contains; I was engaged and fascinated the entire time.  A good read.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Based on a true story this movie was both sad and touching. If you're into watching based on true events and this movie is very moving.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Just read this, don't wait.  It is a slim volume containing vast riches.  The words written down on the page by Victor Frankl are words that all must hear in order to live a full life in this world.  If you have ever entertained a doubt about the value of your existence, you deserve to take in the profound message contained in Man's Search For Meaning.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|this movies was awesome and i don't even like collin farell....suspense and keeps you on your toes action is crazy. if you like action and crazy...this is a movie to watch
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie is a non stop action movie with good acting, a decent story and it continues a great comeback for the franchise.  The new cast certainly has the chemistry, and they are believable as the younger versions of the beloved cast.  I saw it in the 3d iMAX and wow that was pretty amazing.  Bought this the moment it came out just to see the movie without all the bells and whistles.  And it held up.  For me it is just pure fun, and I look forward to more.  Gosh, it the reboot the next generation, who could play Pichard?
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie is funny and crazy...lol...its your typical falling in love type of movie and was a good watch. recommended
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's a very fun game, for all age's. if u like timplerun u will fall in love with this game.
B003B02OOG|4.0|I enjoyed reading this even though I had read Ford County.  I remembered most of the stories and laughed out loud a few times. Can't go wrong with John Grisham books, even if you have read them before.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|When I started these books I had never read anything by this particular author and now I can't get enough. I didn't ever want to put it down and I read all 3 in just about a week. Amazing read!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game.....I already own this game on my pc.  Would  recommended this game to any one. Can play timed or not. Looking forward to more like this game.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|Great movie in the vein of mad max, blade runner and other post apocalyptic sci-fi classics. Another great movie with Kurt Russell is big trouble in little china.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Great Album!  Great follow up to Black Gives Way to Blue. Takes a few listens, but give it a chance.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got this app about two years ago. Well worth it especially if you like puzzles or Mahjong. I wish more apps of this quality were the free app of the day.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album really goes back to the first album. Heavy blues. Killer riffs from Tony Iommi. Thundering bass from Geezer. Good vocals from Ozzy. Would have liked to have Bill Ward play on it, but Brad Wilk gets the job done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It had all of the ingredients needed in a good read to grip your attention and hold it.  The characters were visually crisp and interesting.  The dialogue, on point, and the plot unpredictable.  A VERY GOOD READ!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|For those of you who like masterpiece theatre or any shows that are from different historical eras then you will like this one.  This takes place at a time when the industrial age was changing things really fast.  Class is not as apparent as it once was and the lower working class is not necessarily staying in its place.  I love this series because it shows us the incredible changes these people went through particularly with regard to the social changes from servant class to upper class/ruling class. It explores the changes in women's roles as well.  The acting is amazing.  Love this show!
B001F4UHGC|3.0|This movie had a lot of action, suspense, and a chase scene on the streets of San Francisco that was exciting and impressive knowing there were no computer graphics used in movies of this time period. It is more of a guys' movie, I think. My husband and i watched it together and I personally, didn't like the PG-13 type of  violence in it.. There isn't as much captivating dialogue as there is intrigue.. There's a lot of good guy/bad guy action and interaction.  We are pretty conservative in our movie choices, so the next comments might interest those who are concerned with content.  I don't recall a lot of profanity, though there may have been some, and and I don't think it had sexual content either. There was implied sensuality, but I think the persons were married. Overall, an entertaining movie if you like stories of witness protection, secret police missions, and fighting corruption etc.  .
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book held my interest. I liked it even better than Ender's Game (the first in the quintet). The series turns into a bit of a &#34;mystery&#34; series,but that just gives readers more to look forward to in the rest of the series.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I really didn't find this book that funny.  I was expecting something that would make me laugh out loud, but really I just &#34;heh&#34;ed a few times.  It was alright, and probably Tina Fey fans that have followed her through the years would enjoy it more than I did.  I barely knew who she was.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|Excrllent app!!!! Very fast taggin and many options after you tag a song love this a p p! !<br /><br />Thx Amazon!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing I love it so much. One of the best! I recommend it so much yay lol
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing story of the future with a cliffhanger that grabbed me from the start.  I love this book and the way the characters are unforgettable. I hope there are many more books in this genre. LOVE IT..
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Were this the only work by McEwan one would wonder what all the fuss were about, put it aside and blissfully forget it.  Initially, it appears to be a novel of a late pubescent young woman's sexual exploits.  She's constantly hopping in and out of bed or thinking about or discussing  having made love. It ends with a major cheat akin to the writer waking up from a dream.<br /><br />McEwan's much too good a writer for this to be considered part of his &#34;oeuvre.&#34;
B001NB5BA4|5.0|Outstanding break-up music.  If your heart is broken and you really want to peg it down to feel sorry for yourself, this is the music for you..  Great for running too.  Good rhythm and beat.
B00DW36G32|5.0|Very interesting story line. Denario and Travolta made this an even better movie than expected. Kept us guessing until the very end. Highly recommended.
B000NGTJTY|2.0|It's a complete copy of another asian movie called Internal Affairs with Andy lau, Tony Leung. It's a joke that people are allowed to just steal the ideas from another movie and not even mention it.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|An enjoyable book with a great message about all the roadblocks and turns life presents to us all.  Determination is important, no matter what stage of our lives.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This movie is such a good one...anyone could watch this movie.  It is clean and has a great theme and exciting.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's simple but fun to play this game. The game gets more challenging on each increasing level. You can buy upgrades to make it more exciting.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like the game but just wish it had longer energy or infinite energy.<br />I don't want to spend money on a game that I'm not sure I will continue to play. This game does keep you going and gives you a variety of things to do, but the whole running out of energy kinda gets annoying.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Love this show. Really like this show it is a lot of fun to watch. They do an excellent job of tying together things from multiple seasons to tell an excellent story.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I rarely listen to rap, and although I liked the \\"thrift shop\\" song after hearing it on SNL, it wasn't until my kids demanded I get this for them (and made them pay with their own allowance money), that I actually ordered it and ended up downloading it into my amazon cloud player.  The first time I heard this album, I was completely hooked.  My husband loves it too, and yes, my kids.  The \\"explicit\\" part is not really an issue in our household, and the powerful lyrics make up for it anyhow (IMO).  This album will make you think!  If it doesn't, there something wrong with you. :)  The various backup vocals keep the tunes interesting.  Great album!
B00AB55BS0|4.0|Great season, I only wish it were more....., more of everything.  Everything was very well done. It was excellent.  Great acting, great characters, a classic.  It leaves you wanting more, bigger sets and a longer story line.
B008XCJ03K|4.0|This album has an upbeat tempo. I actually liked the album more than I originally expected. It helps put a pep in my step.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Loved it!! Great movie. Totally exceeded my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone. I will definitely be buying the blu ray.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This was already a free app of the day!  It's bad enough when these \\"premium\\" versions have ads and suck battery life by continuously running, but repeating FAOTD is poor style on Amazon's part (not that I want to look a gift horse in the mouth).<br /><br />But the game gets high marks from me; I played it quite a bit when it was first offered; my wife still plays it.  Finish levels, collect artifacts... the problem is that it seems like you can go forever and not get all the artifacts.  But it adds a bit of novelty to the game to have some incentive to play the different levels.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|Man how did i miss this group? i must of been hiding under a rock. I love this CD from start to finish !! Pick this one up people you won't be disappointed !!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Interesting novel. I see a lot of Diana Wynne Jones here and I like it. I had to read it a couple of times, (not a hardship I can assure you) to truly understand what was going on. You need to have a bit of myth history in you to appreciate what he does here. And if you end up reading it a couple of times I can tell you it will be a good thing.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|another great release from airbourne, maybe not as raw as their other CD's but this is still a solid offering.
B00AW57L96|4.0|Very easy reading,and some twist and turns throughout the novel. I judge a good book on how quickly I get interested in it and it got me straight from the word go.

I just wish it would have come with the slipcover but i will deffinetly be ordering from seller again. Im a very happy customer

B00742BVW8|5.0|This is one of the greatest martial arts movies every made. The cinematography alone makes this one of the most beautiful movies shot to date. If your a fan of martial arts, cinematographical beauty, and a story that will twist you around, this movie is for you.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Terms and Conditions:  Use of the material below is ... just kidding...<br /><br />This book sat for a while until the time was right. I plugged the iPad into the charger and picked up my Kindle... today was the day.  I'm off work for a few days and one of my goals is to read a book or two... first up \\"Anything You Want\\".  I previously had just peeked at the first couple pages on the iPad with the Kindle App, but I was going to read cover to cover and for that I prefer the Kindle.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. Creating a little utopia; in a world so messed up what could be more satisfying?  Is it more about philosophy or the building of a distribution company?  You'll learn that the author never really separated the two.  It's all about the soul of CD Baby.  With a little editing, time compression, and a few more anecdotes it would make a good story for The Moth.<br /><br />The writing is very clear and concise. The fat has been well trimmed and the author provides some real insights that are refreshing, and I believe generally applicable to one's life.  Honest and thought provoking I'm sure many will be nodding their heads in agreement with more than one of the analogies presented. I was easily able to read it all the way through with a brief stop for Crispy Pad Thai about mid way, but I was reading again while I ate.<br /><br />I bought this book because of my love for CD Baby and my respect for their success, but it would be a great book for the young entrepreneur, and it might even help the not so young become the entrepreneur they've dreamed of. This book has the potential to invoke change in the reader, and thus the world.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was huge fan of CD Baby, no one other than maybe another  true CD Baby lover would understand how much I loved CD Baby and the concepts behind it.  I really miss it, even though it still lives on in another form.  I did smile the other day buying a CD; \\"sold by CD Baby Fulfilled by Amazon\\". F*%^$ Apple
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very well detailed game it is the only rpg game that I having had a problem with ever it's awesome.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the way all the characters were all linked to each other.and the the the possibility of what if? A great read
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is one of the funnest games I have ever played. It is also really, really,addicting. I just want to say thank you to the creator of Subway Surfers. Thank you!! :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the story line,especially when the series is watched in continuity.  The characters become friends,may I add friends that keep me up to late.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|We found this movie to be unnecessarily violent. It had lots of action but not an interesting plot. Not one I want to see i want to see again.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I found this to be a great method for finding the 'free channel' area of the crowded bands in the neighborhoods where I work on networks and configure wireless routers.  Very graphical, and it shows relative signal strength!  Handy tool in my 'toolbox' of Android software.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is an amazing improvement over the Android keyboard.  Apart from the cosmetics (lots of choices of keyboard colors, for example), I like being able to select taller keys, the special characters (British pounds, Euros, etc.) that are part of the basic layout, and each key having two functions (holding one down for half a second puts the second function in).  I also appreciate that if I'm using the numeric keyboard, it doesn't revert to an alphabetical mode when I hit the space bar.  Just a great step forward.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Once again the idiots at TV programming took the big chance on a new Sci Fi program and, since it was rich in content, character development and plot, as well as a heck of an exciting show, canned it.  This should have gone on at least as the first Star Trek series, (which almost met the same fate).
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am an Apple and Steve Jobs fan, so I found this book to be very moving. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to be innovative. I see myself as a lot like Steve, hopefully a little less abrasive. I see how corporate culture in most companies breeds mediocrity, and I love how Steve drove people and products to greatness. I became teary many, many times while reading this book, and I think it was because Steve really did impact all of humanity and human history with the tremendous innovations he developed. If you are an Apple fan you will love this book. God bless you Steve. Thank you for making the world a better place.
B00A3VLJCE|1.0|This $9.99 app has proved to be frustrating for me.  I have some familiarity with Coral Paint Shop but none with Photoshop.  This may contribute to my ineptitude figuring this.  I've been playing Round with it for a few weeks yet and have yet to create a piece.  Where do I save a working piece? Undo an effect. Other than the user forums which are sometimes vague and confusing and there is no manual.  Would recommend for seasoned Adobe Photoshop connoisseurs only.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Love dance music . . . just never was a fan of Daft Punk in fact I simply viewed them as a novelty act.  I begrudgingly decided to purchase the CD after hearing stellar reviews of the music to at least give this CD an opportunity.  I expected to hear some soulless electronic music . . . I was stunned by what I heard.  Simply put . . . a Masterpiece.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Enjoyable action without too much stress or blood; great movie for relaxing Friday nite at home with pizza and beer!
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider is awesome, requires you to use the brain, getting it out of the cob webs. LOL Once you get the haring of the game it's a rush.
0143143492|5.0|This is the first Eckhart Tolle book I've read, but certainly not the last.  I read it and then listened to the audio and got more out of it second time around.  Can't wait to read the Power of Now.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|It is obvious that this is her early work and she is getting her chops for the later stuff.  It is good, but her later work is great!
0385536828|4.0|&#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; is just that - a touch of the sweet.  Ian McEwan has created another story plot of suffering and love, sorrow and joy;suspense and intrigue.  As you begin to get into the tale, you know what is going to happen.  But then, surprise.  Turns and twists keep you on your toes until the final page.<br /><br />&#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; is up to Ian McEwan usual high standard.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|So far I love it, bought it because I watched the first season on Netflix.  It's funny and sad and heart warming.  I can't wait to see how it ends.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Worked perfectly and I liked it so much I download its other versions for my PC and Android Cell Phone.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I have read several Jane Austen novels and I think this would be my second favorite compared to Pride and Prejudice. It has similar storylines in that Captain Wentwork is prideful and doesn't pursue Anne at first due to feeling hurt from how they weren't considered an appropriate match several years before his return from the navy. Mr Elliot appears one way, but is to be revealed as another way. I would highly recommend this book if you love Jane Austen
B005K17RU0|1.0|Takes too long to load and then you wind up viewing someone's else data. If I wanted to access a website's data I would just go to the website on the internet connection.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app. Several weeks ago we lost power overnight due to an electrical storm. I was glad to have this alarm clock. Easy to set.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I am a bit older than the targeted audience but still found the book to be a wonderful read. I have always been fascinated with Greek gods since junior high and thought this book did a great job of bringing them into present day.  I had actually watched the movie first and being a huge lover of reading decided to see how it would be as a book.  This book deviates from the film but not so much so that it makes either story unlike able.  With this first book I sped right through it and loved it so much that I ended up reading the entire series plus the Heros of Olympus series that ties in with these books as well. I think it's a great read and not just for kids.<br /><br />The set up for these books is pretty cool.  Basically gods are apparently a real thing not just stories and they are up to their usual tricks of hooking up with mortals and thus creating Demi god children.  In this and the other Percy Jackson books they center around one such Demi god from the god of Poseidon and his adventures at camp half blood( which is a summer type camp that trains and teaches these young kids about there parents and how to survive in the world.) and his adventures out in the real world on quests along with his friends Annabeth and Grover.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I like having multiple alarms, and being able to select different songs. It is easy to use, and set up, I have one work day alarm and another for other occasions that I turn as needed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I ended up watching all 3 seasons in less than a week because I was so enchanted by it! Downton Abbey is an amazing series with amazing actors. The scenery is breathtaking and the writing is phenomenal! And now that I am all caught up I just can hardly wait for season 4!
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This is one of the only solutions that is stable yet supporting Microsoft almost perfect with RTL and objects that other apps havehardtime to open propproperly .<br />Only thing getting it to 4 star is the poor gui.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy playing this game! Have 4other bingo games loaded on my kindle. This is my favorite. Enjoy all the rooms!

B00CHI5B7A|3.0|seems like it didn't quite find it's place between a serious gangster movie and a throwback 40s flick. Overall entertaining
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have loved this version since I saw them playing it on PBS. I adore when all of the Jean Valjean actors sing &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;. Makes me cry every time!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are now among my favorite artists and with good cause too. This album is socially conscious in an exhilarating and fresh manner. Macklemore is an amazing rapper and Ryan Lewis is an incredible DJ and producer. These two have so much potential and I'm looking forward to seeing them at MSG!
B00640UICA|5.0|This is my favorite game so far!  Very cute &amp; very challenging.  I highly recommend you get it! I love how each level introduces new characters.  They all do different things.  You never get bored playing it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Brilliant job ppl. Helped me throughout high school. And it's also good for other things like estimating a paycheck. I highly recommend getting this app
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love this book can't wait to read the next one for sure and see what happens next with these two kids
B0058VW36U|2.0|I don't know why they think that being sold something after practically ever level is a good thing, but I do not agree.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Pleasantly entertaining and a good read.  I will read the next stories of Bob the street cat. Go Bob go!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I now have it on every device I have that supports it.  Now I have it on my phone so I don't have to share
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Just twisted enough to keep me wanting more without questioning my own moral compass. Meaning I don't want to dislike any of the characters for choices made thus far. Can't wait to finish series.
0061780308|5.0|I read the Art of Racing in the Rain a couple of years ago, and thought it was the best dog story I have read. I loved Marley and Me, and Mearle's Door, but Racing in the Rain tops them. And that's saying alot. The story is told from the perspective of Enzo, the race car loving dog. It doesn't hurt that Denny, his owner, is a struggling racer.<br /><br />The audiobook version, though an abridgment of the print version, is even better--because of the reader--Christopher Evan Welch. He brings Enzo to life with his enthusiastic reading of the book. The listener is enveloped in Enzo. There's a part in the book where Enzo tears up a stuffed zebra because he thinks it's evil. In the print version I didn't pay that much attention to Enzo's rational for &#34;killing&#34; the zebra. Listening to it, however, his sense of fear of the zebra and his reaction to are believable.<br /><br />We listen to audiobooks when we travel, and I was pretty sure my wife wasn't going to like this book. Was I wrong! She loved the story and loved Enzo.<br /><br />Even if you've read The Art of Racing in the Rain, I recommend you listen to it, too.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|good story.. unusual role for McConaughey. Nice to see Sam Shephard too! The s word was pretty common but still good to watch with my preteens.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|Main profile H.264 video wouldn't play back smoothly, no support for embedded metadata or SRT subtitles in MP4/M4V files, initial configuration required. Honestly I prefer the stock Amazon video player to this app.
6304697961|4.0|I just bought this copy of Halloween today a Bookmans and when I watched it at home, I really liked it. It was the original movie and not the stupid Rob Zombie remake. I recommend any horror fan to get this movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun diversion for a while, but after you figure out how to solve these puzzles in a methodical way they become a little too easy.
B00005R24K|4.0|I just bought this copy of The Evil Dead today a Bookmans and when I watched it at home, I really liked it. It was the original movie and not the stupid remake. I recommend any horror fan to get this movie.
B007JVJ3C4|3.0|This film is well , not a good movie in a lot of ways.  The guys who did 'rrank' did it. and they decided to go over the top. They even nick cage to act in a most nutty way. This was a disaster for this franchise. The ghost rider is not a campy , nutty character.  I did like the explosive action in this though but you should never encourage nick cage to go over the top, unless it's a scene or two and not every line. In the really good 'vampires' kiss' movie it worked because the character was going mad. (That's a nick cage flick from the 80's). But not in this one. The first movie was played more serious. Now if the Ghost Rider was a character that is going mad then all the weird and wacky scenes might work, but he's not , he's tormented and dark. Well we got wacky here. still this is a high budget movie and not the worst movie ever made. Seriously , people who say that have not seen the many b movies I have, or c movies, or d movies. NOthing is as bad a d movie. (people with camera and no experience), this is rather a schlocky version of the ghost rider and that's a shame.  There is a documentary on this one and some previews. The villain here was a good one , a carrion man, but they did a strange bubble effect that wasn't needed when he attacks. This movie may have ended the careers of the filmmakers, It's happened before. But they do make some good action camp flicks. They just weren't real fans of the ghost rider probably. Comics are cool and these guys strayed into a rather comedic approach sometimes.  Buy this for the great 3d conversion. And it does look great. Unlike lets say 'I robot'.  Which is not a good conversion. Or even worse the many german 3d conversions of films like 'daybreakers'. So this is entertaining , but it's also very campy and such.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Love this cd.  I first heard Joe Bonamassa on PBS - during this live performance and had to have it.
0156528207|5.0|A very sweet story recommended by a very sweet friend. This person wears a chain around their neck with a single small star, such as the one on the last page in the book. I was told it reminds them 'to see the Boa instead of the hat.' No regrets in buying this book. Absolutely adorable, love it.
B000I8G5NA|4.0|I liked the first Men In Black, and this was good as well. The combination of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones works very well especially in an action comedy.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|i love both buck and merle and vince and paul did an outstanding job. I would recomend this to everybody.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I love this show; it’s a science fiction western (not like Cowboys and Aliens, it’s a western in space) that sounds like a hard combination to pull off but they hit it right on the money. The writing and cast fit together perfectly and made for very enjoyable viewing. Like so many others my only complaint is that they only made one season.
B0064UPU4G|2.0|MP3 album has very low sound quality. The files purport to be around 225 kb/s, but they sound really bad. Not sure what the issue is.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Great movie!! Great plot!! Great acting!!! It was exciting from the opening scene. Great villain as well!!! I was off the edge of my seat the entire movie.
B000BKHL1K|2.0|Not so great,bottles nest upward not perfectly horizontal. They need to rethink this one. It also said German made in the description. the box it came in said made in China. What's up with that?? I will use for now. But, $50.00 was too much. Should be half the price.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game all round.  Graphics awesome and having challenging levels makes you want to keep playing.  Keep up the good work
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I have never used this!  I do not intend to use it.  I have nothing of value to say!  Oh, well!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|To my surprise there are scenes in the DVD that were not on TV.  It is a huge bonus to see the older seasons with NEW scenes.  One of the very best Series on TV.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|I loved this and was so glad I didn't pass it up.  The first EP was beautiful, but I felt like it was Trent's words coming out of an utterly spellbinding voice; however, the spell was not powerfull enough to cover the way I experienced the songs. It was painful because I could hear in my head how it would have sounded had Trent done the singing.  This time, it felt like they found their joint balance lyrically and vocally. For me at least, it helped that there was much more of Trent's vocal presence, even if it was softer and in the background.  I ended up catching two shows during their tour, and they are, unsurprisingly, even better live!

0307352153|5.0|This world is overrun with white noise and people who love to hear themselves talk.  There are too many needy people bothering other people with their problems, and too few books like this one, stressing the importance of solitude.  A beautiful, original work.  Those who appreciate this book should also read a new e-book called DEBUNKING THE FITNES MYTH (an e-book for $3.99), where solitude is mentioned as an essential component of happiness and worldy success.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00EWSLDCA DEBUNKING THE FITNESS MYTH]]

0385349947|5.0|This is a great book for promoting the empowerment of women.  Despite the author's relatively posh background, she provides much helpful advice that applies to all women.  I have to say I admire her personal strength. I also recommend a new e-book for $3.99, about personal empowerment for women AND men, called DEBUNKING THE FITNESS MYTH - A groundbreaking approach to health wealth and happiness.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00EWSLDCA DEBUNKING THE FITNESS MYTH]]
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|The hype made this out to be THE book to read; supposidly beautifuly written, srikingly independent and adventerous. If you liked &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34; or the imfamous &#34;Bridges of Madison County&#34; then you'll like this. It's junk food for the real reader but not a  meal. The character grows tiresome. Not much about the actually hiking journey iteself and certainly no  Annie Dilliard - for someone spending this much time in the wild, the resolutions barely occur in her head and not once in what nature could have revealed. I was disappointed with her evident immaturity, lack of real insight and so called wild lifestyle. I've seen and read worse with much more spiritual clarity in the end that this. Felt nothing at all for this character and certainly no feeling that she'd wrestled demons and overcome her past. I think she just grew up over the years and this hiking trip just happened along the way. Bet the movie will be better/.
159562015X|5.0|This is a fine book for showing readers how to accentuate the positives and minimize weaknesses.  Who doesn't want to be stronger, after all?

B00E97AZZK|3.0|Now You See Me features a pretty impressive cast, including Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Melanie Laurent, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, David Franco, and Isla Fisher. The story begins with each of the magicians showcasing their skills on their own. They are all mysteriously brought together, and the story jumps forward one year to an amazing bank heist. I think this would have worked better as a heist movie, rather than a \\"whodunit,\\" as it ended up being. All along, the story wants you to figure out who brought them all together, and why. The third act doesn't quite pull everything together like it should. There's enough in here to make it worth a rental. Woody Harrelson is fantastic as a mentalist. Eiseneberg does his usual thing very well, and Isla Fisher does very well in her role. There is a decent amount of humor in the film as well, but it just isn't quite as magical as it could be.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game and very simple, slight lag occasionally but easily fixed by closing app or moving back a screen in-game. Would recommend this to a friend.
B00005YJMX|3.0|This film assumes you already know the basic vampire story so it takes it's time focusing on the motives and instincts of each character.  The symbolism is obvious but not overstated.  When a man ignores warnings and climbs the steep rocky path to a place where evil lives, trouble will be waiting for him at home.  Unfortunately Herzog held the camera on Kinski so long as to diminish the effect.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Raising the ordinary to extraordinary, indeed. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about so I bought the book. Fifty Shades of Grey proved itself to be more than the average BDSM books in that it actually has a strong story line and there is so much depth to the characters. It's modern and realistic, soulful and edgy.<br /><br />At the outset I thought the novel was an out and out romance one but then the layers to Grey started to reveal themselves so that what you see is not entirely what you get.<br /><br />This is my favourite of the trilogy. Let me tell you this, once you buy book 1 you are going to want to buy the others.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bond makes a \\"Rocky\\" style comeback from being in a rut.  This time a villain with personal motives gets him on the case.  There is just enough time in an exotic location, an escape from henchmen, and showdowns with the villain on his own turf, then in a neutral location, then finally on Bond's turf.  It's a formula that works and keeps things moving more like the earlier films did.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|More kinky sex but with a ring this time. You have to finish the series because that's where all the loose ends get tied up. New romances, someone expecting and how Grey reacted as well as the ends that people will go to for revenge are revealed in the final installment of Fifty Shades. Grey is now freed of his past's prolonged hold on his and is now on the path of recovery with his Anna's help.<br /><br />Tragedy after tragedy was a tad bit unrealistic though especially so close to the other.<br /><br />I bought this book for closure. There's a little present at the end of the novel though that I particularly enjoyed.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|If you've seen the trailer then you pretty much know it all.  This boy appears to be turning human again so fast that survivors may have to re-examine who the real enemy is.  I prefer \\"Zombieland\\" but there's enough laughs and action to make it mildly watchable.  The last CGI shot of the city makes you think about Israel and the hordes of armed arabs surrounding it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fouls rush in. Book 2 starts by reuniting our two main characters and favourite couple. More layers to Grey are revealed and the relationship between Christian and Anna grows. In book 2 I particularly liked the showdown between Anna and Mrs. Robinson at the end and how Anna's slimy boss got what he deserved.<br /><br />Grey's past is catching up with the present and it is a struggle between the couple to reconcile them. Grey has lived this ordered life for so long as a means of coping with his misconceptions bout himself. Will he change for Anna? Will it be enough?
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|You don't really mind some of the plot holes in this story because they keep the momentum going.  Killing more and more people is not the way to deflect attention from your original motive.  I can't tell if Herzog is playing the villain straight or if he feels it's a parody of all tortured movie psychos.  There are enough fights, chases, and shootouts to make any action fan happy.
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|This show is perfect for the over worked mom!  It holds your child in a trance like state and does so with few words/sounds!  Put it in and catch a quick nap on the couch!  When you awake your child will be sitting quietly watching sheep, chickens, and pigs!  There are no silly catch phrases for your child to scream in your ear all day. If my kid watches one minute of nickelodeon he runs around like he just drank a two liter of Mt.Dew, not with this wonderful show!!  When I awaken he climbs into my lap to cuddle while the birds sing and squirrels play outside our windows!!  It is truly a WONDERFUL show!
0064471837|5.0|I picked up Sabriel when I was around 13 and it has been my favourite book (and then series) ever since. This was my first foray into the fantasy genre and I felt like I had discovered something so special, so amazing that I think I read only it over and over for an entire summer.<br /><br />The characters are so brilliantly well written and well rounded that the book reads like a dream. It's such a smooth and enjoyable read that you hardly find time passing while you're engrossed. The lore and the way Nix introduces the magical aspect of the world is so fascinating that it will captivate any reader regardless of their age.<br /><br />Nix was writing 'strong female characters' before it became a thing. The women of this series are powerful, mighty, soft and decisive and more often than not, they end up saving the world. Having Sabriel in your (or your child's) life can do nothing but good.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|The first one (while not very good) was somewhat better.  This Dredd follows the recent action thriller theme of the hero battling his way through several floors of a building.
0439023491|4.0|it was package very well i will recommend it to my friends<br />and family to you and everyone else<br />thank you/
B000LXQVA4|5.0|purchased this for my 5 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it. can jump and play from 30 mins to an hour in one sitting. very safe and colorful to keep her entertained.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|It was better than Thor!  I had to watch this to tie it into the Avengers movie.  It was worth watching!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For all ages. Cute fun something to love on down times!!  Only downside don't like go add friends to play. Don't have many friends that would like to play at my age!!
B00AYLTMMM|3.0|A very awkward film.  While it was based on a true story, obviously liberties were definitely taken with the truth.
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|The castle was 60 dollars the family was another 39 dollars , so basically a hundred dollars.<br />The castle broke the second day and is irreparable.<br />The heads pop off the dolls , the boy dolls will stand, momentarily, the castle has a sound board where you press the feet of the dolls and you get sentences or music, depending on the doll.<br />The dolls are not anywhere near being worth 8 bucks apiece and Disney has made this deal so every time you order one thing your kiddo is going to want something else because the pieces are sold in such a way that demands you buy something else to have what you need to make the toy a set that is fun to play with. What a rip off and a cheaply made rip off on top of that. With aprox. 99 dollars invested I have a doll house now in the trash and a set of poorly made overpriced dolls , I salvaged the platform that takes four triple A batteries so my kiddos can at least have that much .  Basically money in the trash and very unhappy grand daughters.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Everyone needs something to live for. Sometimes its a tiny scrap of life that needs you too. It was fate for Bob to turn up when he did. Somewhere in our narrators story he picked up Karma that sent him Bob. The level of non judgmental empathy and understanding which came from Bob is not found in many humans. Our Narrator has failed the people in his life and they had painfully let him slip away with regret. Bob is the piece of the emotional puzzle which fits them all together again. Thank goodness it was not another animal story where the dog or in this case cat dies in a tear jerking ending. A book to really enjoy and rejoice in the fact there are lots of second chances and sometimes they come in odd packages..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book! I just can't say that enough. This book kept me reading and most importantly, it kept me guessing! Just when I thought I knew for certain what would happen, bam! I was completely wrong. I loved it! And I loved the epilogue too! Such a different style of boo  than I'm used to but I can't wait to see what other books this author has written. I'm sure they are just as great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I cant beleive they removd herobrine but i want a hunger bar because<br />I have so much food i make because iv got big house and lots of chests
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I needed a dictionary and I chose this one because of the name.  I will be using it a lot in the near future.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Game plot was good and puzzles were challenging.  I would have liked to have more of the picture puzzles where you have to figure out how the picture goes together.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I don't know what else to say. I think by now I have made it pretty clear I love this series and love watching the show over and over because the disks aren't at risk of breaking. Thanks for being awesome.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|After all these years, I'm still impressed with Sissy Spacek's performance. So sweet in the scenes with William Katt and so terrifying with those eyes surrounded by blood. I can't imagine any of the remakes will ever hit this level of greatness.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Shipped promptly<br />It's TBBT, one of my favorite seasons too.<br />Great condition and reasonable price.<br />Love watching this season as much as I can.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I got this because of a suggestion for opening a certain type of file, but I ended up deleting it because I couldn't figure out how to use it. Not really for your every-day Kindle User.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I don't know what else to say. I think by now I have made it pretty clear I love this series and love watching the show over and over because the disks aren't at risk of breaking.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I have used better Mahjong apps before. This one is fine, no problems to speak of, just not as user friendly as others.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Um it's TBBT. was shipped promptly and was in Great condition. Plus the disks are actually holding together, unlike the disks I got in season 5 from walmart.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Good story, no complaints.  This is your classic story of the Wizard of Oz. If you know the story you know what I mean.
B00CJCHJ8S|4.0|This represents almost a complete showcase of Harry Nilsson's work, with lots of extra outtakes, radio spot promos, etc. and is fun to listen to from start to finish.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the app for the Weather Channel. It has had no problems and it is easy to use. Good app.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.<br /><br />It's the story of the rise and fall of Charlie, a mentally challenged man who through either luck or misfortune finds himself the recipient of an experimental surgery to increase his intellect.<br /><br />The story is written in the form of journals Charlie must write for the researchers to be able to chart his progress. He becomes more than anyone thought possible but then he loses it. It was a painful progression and regression to watch. You cannot help but feel the joys and horrors he experiences as he goes through this evolution.<br /><br />It will be a while before I can shake this feeling I have from reading it. Horribly sad but also incredibly joyful.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is just one of those apps you need if you're planning on doing any serious work, and if you have any PDF documents.
B003G4W49C|3.0|This is a hard book to rate. I couldn't decide if I even liked it for most of the story. It wasn't until I was into the final 1/5 that I decided it was good, which also happened to coincide with the first bit of real science fiction in the book. Some would argue that the whole book was sci-fi but it would depend on your interpretation of sci-fi. I believe that in a true science fiction, the story could not exist without the science. Most of this book wasn't really about the science - it was about bullying, manipulation, child abuse, war, sibling rivalry and relationships (or the lack thereof) between friends and family.<br /><br />There wasn't much depth in the characters but for the most part they were all young children who were taken by the Government to build into the greatest soldiers. They don't have the life experience to be 'deep'. As brilliant as Ender and the others are, they really don't know anything...not until the end anyhow. This was when I felt Ender really grew as a person. When he shows understanding and true empathy.<br /><br />I don't really have a whole lot more to say on this book. I would encourage others to read it but I wouldn't necessarily say for certain that they would like it. I think it depends on how you read it - as an adult looking at what is done to the children in this story or as a child looking at the greatness they could achieve. I can see it from both angles and I suppose that is why I cannot truly decide how I feel about it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What is there not to love about Solitaire? It is classic, it is easy, and it is nice to play if you don't have that buddy to play with.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Review after reading all three books in series:<br /><br />I originally had no intentions of reading this book (series) but frankly every girl I know is talking about it and I just had to be in on the discussion. What actually cinched the deal was when I saw a spoof on Saturday Night Live - OK, if it's so popular that they are making fun of it, I have to read it.<br /><br />My genre of choice is YA dystopian, which is pretty far off from what this series is, so I was sure I was going to hate it but I was pleasantly surprised. It actually had an interesting story to it and it was an incredibly easy read.<br /><br />The reason there are so many women who love the book isn't just for the sex. After some discussions with friends, most skimmed through the sex parts like I did but they just couldn't get enough of Christian....and here is why:<br />-He's gorgeous<br />-He's got a perfect body<br />-He's intelligent<br />-He's super wealthy<br />-He is mentally broken and what woman can pass up the chance to \\"fix\\" a guy.<br />Women just have an inborn need to fix and nurture. I don't know why that is. After 40 years on this planet and meeting so many screwed up men, I've determined we apparently aren't that good at it. Maybe it's time to find a new hobby.<br /><br />My issues with the book are the following:<br />1. The author could have developed the story lines a bit more and taken some of the sex out.<br />2. I got a bit tired of the same words and sayings being used over and over. (yes, yes, we know he was beguiled and if I hear Laters baby one more time I will scream)<br />3. The book should have been edited and if it was, the editor should be on the unemployment line.<br />4. The author will not win any literary awards - the writing wasn't great, but she does keep you interested and isn't that what is really important?<br /><br />The first issue above was the biggest problem for me - I could have really gotten lost in Ana's \\"sooo-never-gonna-happen-to-me\\" life. I almost felt by the middle of book two that I could justify spending $3,250 on a pair of shoes. It could have been so much more (did I mention the editor should have been fired?), but in retrospect, this was a really terrific series for someone who is not an author by profession and who am I to judge - I've never written a book either. Good work Mrs. James!!st felt by the middle of book two that I could justify spending $3,250 on a pair of shoes.

B008FRFN7A|1.0|I  tried using this app to print but couldn't get it to work. It's not very user-friendly and I wouldn't use it again.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|If this were any other book, I would think it was too predictable, but this is a futuristic Cinderella - the basic plot has to be predictable. I applaud Marissa Meyer with what she did with it. I've read or watched many versions of this story and this was the most unique. A cyborg Cinderella...from the moon. This story does differ in one major aspect in that it doesn't end in a \\"happily ever after\\" moment. Not yet anyhow. I'm looking forward to reading more of the series to see how the rest of the story plays out.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|This app didn't do what it promised it would do, which is analyze my wi-fi. It seems a bit pointless when the wi-fi connection strengths are already shown on your list of available networks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a blast. I have lots of fun and I love the fluffy unicorn upgrade, and the best battle is the vector battle.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is the Android version of the Draw Something game. It is easy to use and navigate. I have had no problems with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was one of the best books I've ever read I just loved and hated the suspense in here I just loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you use Pinterest, this app is a must-have for your kindle. It is easy to use and I have had no problems with it to date.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't wait for season three to come out on dvd so I started reading the books.Wow, I am so glad I did. I could not put it down. Read it and see for yourself
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is easy to use and does the job. Therefore, I must give it 5 stars. I have had no problems with it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's.  Really cool game I love it but it does get challenging at times but it's worth it and fun I would get
B009IF8CH6|5.0|If you're a BBT fan, you don't need to read reviews - and if you haven't seen this show before, and love zany, funny, off-the-wall humor, this show is definitely for you! I bought all the seasons and watched them all within a few days. I couldn't stop.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin are obviously two outstanding musicians.  Without Gill's guitar work and Franklin's pedal steel work, BAKERSFIELD wouldn't be half as great as it is.  They took some of Buck Owens' finest songs and some of Merle Haggard's finest songs and made them their own without straying far from the essence of any of the originals.  If you want a real country album that was released in 2013, BAKERSFIELD should be high on your list.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Friend loan me this book and I can't put the book down.  Awesome reading.  CAN'T wait until the movie comes out.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome Movie, nice movie, good graphics and sound Looking forward for part two with all supper heroes , Need more of HULK :)
B001EC3JME|4.0|i have had this holster for over 7 months and is still holding. i wear it everyday as i do guard services and constantly using it and moving. it has loosen a bit but not too much to worry that my $50 led flashlight will fall out. i recommend this holster to anyone looking for a well built product that will last a while.
0060794410|5.0|I wish I would have done this years ago.  I listen to them in the car all the time and need to buy a new book!
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Yep, it's a great movie...my wife saw it in the theatres but I waited to rent the Blu-Ray. So, I rented the HD version on Prime and the quality was terrible. It was so grainy that it distracted me during the movie. I eventually got used to it, like would eventually get used to not wearing my glasses but I had a headache after the movie. 4 stars for the movie but barely 2 stars for picture quality.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So many beautiful sounds and very calming. Would love to use it to sleep... I actually got this as a \\"cool down\\" for my 3 yo and 4 yo daughters. Time out does not work for us so I am trying a new approach that keeps their mind off of \\"punishment\\" (no stewing and getting angrier! from my 4 yo) and has a timer that can't be broken (R.I.P. egg timer)
B001XCWPAM|5.0|Better than James Bond. Bought the blu ray to go with new tv. Amazed at the clarity of the picture.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book - terrfic character development (as usual) and just a &#34;hint&#34; of the supernatural - enough to make it a SK book but not enough to make it hokey.  It was an emotional book too...I was reading  on the train - mistake, as it made me cry. I know people are complaining about this not being in ebook format but get over it and read this one. It's a great story!
B002BEXF5A|5.0|So many good times were spent with this album as the backing soundtrack in my days as an art student!<br /><br />One of the most excellent live albums ever recorded!!  Top British progressive rock musicians of the 70's blowing peoples minds not only live, but through the recoding of their performance!<br /><br />And the collectors edition gets the Cd of their rehearsal material!!
B007GE2H3G|3.0|The kids (ages 3-10) enjoyed this one, and we adults were mildly entertained, but it was a bit slow at times for me and I think the kids didn't quite follow the plot line (as we had to explain things a few times). Still, a nice family movie night pick.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is Addictive fun. Be careful or you will spend way too much time playing. Get it but but don't lose sleep over it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was more than I had expected. I've watched all the versions so far and have been pleased with them all, but the quality, of course, with the newest version made this experience very special. Happy that I did purchase this packet, I am very satisfied with buying movies from Amazon and I will continue to buy from them and continue to be well-pleased, I'm sure.~
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great comic book movie.  I am not a comic book fan, so I do not know how faithful the movie is to the comics, but I thought this was well-done: good balance of action, humor and drama and of course, Robert Downey Jr. was his usual fantastic self.  Parenting comment: Watched it with my 15 year old daughter and nothing objectionable here they don't have in prime time network TV, probably less in fact.
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|This longtime Film Advocate was appalled by Session 1 to the point that I have no intention of watching the other 14 segments.  On the entertainment level, the bland unimpressive voice of Mark Cousins was sleep inducing.  The never ending insults he made towards American Cinema were tasteless and nonfactual.  The irony was that not moments after saying inappropriate and incorrect evaluations about Hollywood, he then showed some segments of US films followed by praising terms.  This made the comments more that hypocritical in the philosophical aspects as well as the overall project's tone (and his voice, as mentioned previously, was toneless as well).  More importantly, the nasty anti-US attitude were not followed up by showing, in any depth, better films from other nations. Thus, his attempts to disparage American Movie production was not followed up to prove his point(s) that other places were equal to and better than what came forth from California.<br /><br />In addition, the overall focus of the program was confusing in structure.  Cousins went rambling around timelines with 1980 films superimposed with 1896 movies.  This wound up making the whole concept of the session non-chronological despite the title -  \\"The Story of Film:  An Odyssey.\\"  Had it been focused upon film techniques and/or cinematic grammar it might have been fine.  However, his constant jumping around on concept, timeframe, and failure to illustrate his ideas were another severe lack (and, to repeat, his bland voice was less than catching).<br /><br />As a result, this longtime Film Historian - lecturer at MoMA, Festival Lecturer, who also was acquainted with both Blanche Sweet and Lillian Gish found the time watching a real waste.  As a result, over the next 14 weeks, I spend Monday evenings either re-reading my Citadel Film History Books, Scribner's History of Cinema and, in terms of first hand, Linda Arvidson's (Mrs. Griffith) \\"When the Movies Were Young\\" (1925), as well as watching DVDs asanything is better rather than listening to the diatribe of someone who seems to have the concepts of a 15 year old while trying to sound knowledgable via an ill-informed speech of misinformation.
B00BSBUZPK|1.0|Yes I am an EAGLES fan. I liked this doco as a publicity stunt snow job on Henley & Frey but I felt that Don Felder was not given enough screen time. This includes Glenn Frey saying Don Felder can't sing. HOGWASH! In talking about Felder singing. They NEVER put his vocals up for US to hear, to judge. Most unfair of all involved. Randy Meisner came to the EAGLES via Rick Nelson's Stone Canyon Band. That is not mentioned. They say he came from POCO to the EAGLES,,,Not true at all. Meisner quit POCO to join Rick Nelson's band then onto the EAGLES.<br /><br />I would have liked to have more of Randy Meisner & Bernie Leadon talk more in the newer interviews. No it was the Henley & Frey show. Okay, Yeah they are the main men of that band. Now Felder wasn't too wise at handling band situations and Frey was a powder keg with a short fuse. Although Frey wouldn't mess with Bernie Leadon ( Because Bernie would wipe the bloody floor with Frey. Bullies are like that you know. They stay away from anyone who can rally give them a serious fight.)<br /><br />Still it is a great band. They should have shown the full Rock N Roll Hall of Fame clip along with all the boys playing their 2 songs as a DVD extra and added as an extra longer interviews with Walsh, Schmit, Meisner, Leadon and Don Felder. Buy Felder's Solo CD \\"Road to Forever.\\" but do NOT purchase it from the crooks at Import CD's in Irvine Ca.
B00004Z4SD|3.0|This movie was a little slow moving and didn't seem to be a very high produced movie! I liked the story of it and that it was based on a true story but I think it could have been a lot shorter. I liked it because I knew the area it was filmed in. A one time watch movie!!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|i really liked this book, until the end. easy read. and i liked the twists and turns.  i liked the format. but i was completely let down by the ending.  so many ways this book could have ended and that's it?!?!  eh, what a let down.
0060531053|5.0|Bought this before my first brew.  Even if you are buying a kit, get this book.  It explains the science and terminology in a very friendly manner that will stick with you.  After I'd done about 10 brews, I picked it up and read it again.  I caught all sorts of tips that were over my head before I brewed.  Really, if you have one brewing book, this should be it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Only buy this app as a quick transportable rather than getting your computer if you don't have a computer buy this app OTHERWISE BUY THE ******* PC VERSION SPEND 20 MORE BUCKS FOR SOMETHING<br />20 TIMES BETTER! SO DON'T BE A ********
B0036S4B6M|3.0|THe stories are interesting but a bit short and choppy.  Too much jumping from one topic to another, not enough of a central theme to really hold your attention.
0393316041|5.0|Heard of this book before but only after started reading it I realized how funny and mischievous a great mind can be. It is amazing to get to know the incidents, experiences and deeds of a curious Physicist.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I never realised when I got my Kindle Fire HD you'd be able to get a game like this. I'm in heaven :-)
0345803485|1.0|This is the worst \\"prose\\" I have ever read in my brief 62 years.  Could not wrap a fish in it.  Would love to see a throwdown with Styron, Marquez, or some random 8th grader.  Only for fans of cliche, redundancy, and the absurd (without the wink).
B00271DNP4|5.0|Best movie in the Harry potter series. I love the fact that I could rent it for the day. Great way to watch a movie on short notice.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to setup, almost plug and play.<br /><br />I was able to stream videos from my iPad within 5 minutes of opening the box that the product came in.<br /><br />You should definitely use the extender that comes with the product, it distances Chromecast from the shielding in the TV and improves its connection.<br /><br />Definitely happy with this product.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Just enjoyed the idea of a change involving yourself with kids can make.  I thought it was pretty well done.
0792165020|5.0|This is another plot that I think is unique and original...Jude Law is absolutely gorgeous and as ever, an excellent actor, Matt Damon and Gweneth Palthrow are fantastic...a must see, it's twists and turns will have you totally engrossed, wondering what the ultimate outcome will be in the midst of so many deceptions.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Shines in this movie, everyone wants him to give them answers to which he just brings up more questions. Ex Military police officer Jack Reacher shows up after a man he tried to prosecute before, ends up being accused of 5 murders. I wont give it away but this is a good movie to sit and watch at least 2 or 3 times to get the full picture.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I went in not expecting much. I like Baz Luhrmann films well enough, and really anticipated only watching it for its cinematography. This movie was beautiful aesthetically as well as a beautiful story line. The acting on everyone's part was brilliant. I know the current music in it bothered some, but I enjoyed it. It was true to a Luhrmann film in that regard. DiCaprio and Mulligan are wonderful, and truly the sheer beauty in all of it is breathtaking. You really feel for Gatsby even though he may not be all sane. I would recommend this to anyone without giving it a second thought!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|It was a good movie.  Liked how they brought all the characters together. I think the action was good, and the acting as well.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!! It's so fun! It's better than Candy Crush or any of those game, it's awesome. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I love it!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I got this app for my children to play but they kept having problems with app crashing. They even uninstalled it from their devices. Good thing it was free.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The album was great! In awesome condition. Couldn't have ask for any better. Thanks! Would recommend to any one to use this site.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app for my children because all of their friends play this game. They love it. I find them playing the game whenever they can. It certainly keeps their interest.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Uno is one of my favorite card games and I really enjoy being able to pay online against friends and random people. It keeps freezing every time I try to start a new game causing me to force quit the game and i still lose 2 tokens even though I had to force quit. Also it freezes up from time to time as I'm playing and doesn't let me play my turn. All in all its a great game but it freezes up a lot and it is very annoying losing tokens when you don't even get to play the round.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I rented this movie because I enjoy reading the books. I thought this movie was pretty true to the original story and was entertaining to watch.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|The plot was interesting but it could have better written. It was somewhat predictable. The acting was good--especially Denzel Washington and John Goodman. In fact, John Goodman's performance as the quirky drug supplier stole the show, as far as I'm concerned. It's certainly worth the price for viewing.
B0055S348W|5.0|It worked the first time, and continues to work well with my galaxy 10 inch notepad and my HP printer.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|For those that love STNG, season six has it all. From Troy in a see thru nightie, to Worf in combat, to Beverly with a case of horns... it's all good!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is such a fun game to play..  The graphics and audio are good.  The difficulty is a gradual change!!!
B00DHHFKE4|5.0|Very real -  the reader takes the journey with the author from misspent youth to mature, thoughtful and &#34;rehabilitated&#34; adult.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Not as much fun as Solitaire Blitz.  Boring graphics.  My daughter downloaded this for me and there are many more solitaire games with better graphics that are more fun to play.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|If my product was shipped securely and didn't have scratches all over the discs i could recommend this film from seeing it in the theater but i am not writing this to be mean, i just dont want this to happen to anyone else. i just do not want anyone to expect a quality product or even one that can be used or watched. Basically this company sent me scratched discs that a cleaner and resurface cant fix. My son and i waited a week for something to throw in the trash. Make sure to never buy from this third party company. Unless u need small shiny Frisbee. They wouldn't even send me the code that is supposed to come with the insert so we could at least watch the digital copy on our computer. Just 4 scratched disks. The third party company (exclusive_company_entertainment) should not be  allowed to sell on amazon. Buy amazon only for excellent quality and unbroken products.
B005AUWY90|5.0|My 3-year-old grandson liked Cars so much that I decided to get Cars2. The animation in these movies is outstanding.
B002UPQ1P6|3.0|A good selection of songs from the first 3 Twisted Sister albums, and some cool live tracks. The photos of the band throughout their history are fun. However, I was a bit annoyed that Come Out and Play and Love is for Suckers are both completely ignored. These albums may not have been as successful, but each had some strong tracks that were worthy of inclusion in CD like this one.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I chose this rating for the book because it had many morals and life lessons. I actually starts reading this book for my ninth grade honors summer reading, this book even though slow at the beginning it sped up into an enjoyable book that took you on a journey with a young Spanish shepherd boy and his path to find his own treasure.
0525478817|5.0|Why is it that adults often put down teen love as just a phase and somehow not real? All love is real. The pain is real. This book captures something few others have. Not since reading Deborah Hersh is a Liar have I found an author who is so genuine. This is a must read. Enjoy.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|If you're into Victorian style literature, this book series is for you. I love it. It's amazing. I recommend to everyone who likes to read.
0743216385|5.0|Anyone will love this book. Please enjoy it! I did. It filled in numerous &#34;holes&#34; from the movie. You will be happy with your purchase.
1476733953|5.0|I initially bought this book A. because it was cheap, and B. Because of the 4 1/2 star review.  I am a huge fan of the dystopian genre, but haev never experienced a read quite like this.  From the very beginning the author keeps you glued to the pages with dozens of questions arrising out of the first few chapters.  They are each slowly answered but with the perfect story leading up to each of these answers.  I loved the characters and love how the author focuses the story on numerous viewpoints and doesnt rely on one main character. Contrary to other reviews i particulary loved the details the author gave especially as the kind of environment described I have never encountered in a book before. I think this series has already proven itself a timeless classic and I've only just finished the first book.  Let me mention that upon finishing i bought the second set of Books within 30 seconds. I guarantee anyone else who starts this series will do the same.  BUY THIS AND YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY. Congrats to Hugh Howey on this writing.  I believe he has accomplished so much in a genre that in my opinion has been diluted over the past few years following the Hunger Games.  Read and Enjoy! Now excuse me while I start the next chapter of the saga.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Highly entertaining and the music is wonderful.  Underlying theme is how to overcome fear and reach your full potential (and find love)!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|If you've ever worked in Corrections or been subjected to the system as an inmate or loved-one, you will recognize the accuracy of this book. Very different from the Netflix series, but very worthwhile reading.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Good way to end the book series in my never to be humble opinion. Nice twist on who the leaves Sookie with that should leave all the pathetic Eric-shippers pulling their hair out.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Chews up the battery a little bit but I guess it's necessary in order to keep time and alarm synchronized.  Much better than the other alarm apps I've tried and deleted (which all sucks up a lot more of the battery).  Gives you multiple alarms and days of the week to choose from as well.  Does exactly what you need an alarm to do with lots of ring tones to set your mood to.  Great app.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|It's fun to use ,and to know the names of the stars.and to see we're they are, and we're the North Star is
B004K58GSO|4.0|Always enjoy watching this star and good story line. Will look for more of his movies and thanks for having this service.
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|it is really cool  I can get into people wifi our famliy. likes to travel a lot so much easier. than free nettwork
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Product much better than the one that came with the new kindle.  Heavier duty and more sturdy.  Thanks for sending.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|I'm a fan of the book. Always has been one of my favorite stories. So I stayed away from this in the theater after reading all the negative reviews.<br /><br />I finally rented it here from Amazon and I was wishing I had bought a Bluray copy at the end. It starts out big. All the fanfare of Hollywood and the roaring twenties, that's the first hour.<br /><br />Like the book, all the glitz and glamour wears off in the second half when you learn who Gatzby is. That's when it becomes less about glamour and more of a drama to tell the actual story.<br /><br />It follows the book religiously, as it should. I'm not a film buff, but this deserves a lot more credit. I'd watch it again and again.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Sometimes you want to hit the main character, but honestly this show is a lot deeper than just Piper-- none of the support characters are necessarily what they first seem to be. Be warned, the first episode has a lot more sex/ nudity than in general. (Yes the series does have some sexual themes but the first episode is just not representative). I really liked the writing and I like that you never know what's going to happen. This show explores some of the power dynamics between the guards and the prisoners (and abuses thereof), how people from different backgrounds end up in prison, and also how the prisoners get along while they are there. I am super psyched for the next season!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Saw this last year & wanted watch it while traveling so I bought it and put it on my iPad!
B008M721MS|1.0|For my kindle HD, it doesn't work properly. Seriously. I hate that I can't rotate the screen, and something is wrong with the keyboard every time pops up to type.
