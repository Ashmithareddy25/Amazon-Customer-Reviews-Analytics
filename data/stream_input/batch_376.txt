B0000CFWZA|5.0|These Vancouver boys out-did themselves with this cd!!!  As far as I'm concerned, all of the songs are hits.  Each one hits you with its meaning.  All 11 tracks are edgy.   I never get tired of hearing it!!  I really look forward to hear more of these talented guys!!!!
B000001EAQ|3.0|U2's Pop; it's the album that some fans, including myself, tend to want to forget ever happened when you consider the success that U2 has experienced over the years.<BR>Pop is a mockery in more ways than one.  The songs themselves, are decently solid yet mixed in a way attempting to explode sonic color into otherwise dark songs.  This is where U2 abandons the idea of letting the song be (which they demonstrated in the past as one of their strong-points), instead trying to give it a sound that's not natural to the song.  Ironically, the lyrics seem to mock the world (or people of the world) of doing the same thing in life - trying to fill the darkness of life with things that don't naturally fit and fulfill you.  Possibly the production of the music was demonstrating what the lyrics were saying.  If this was the case, U2 sacrificed good music to prove a point, which leaves the U2 fan disatisfied.  Even though the songs are strong in themselves(while ignoring some of the sounds), none can match their previous hits such as \\"Stay\\" and many other songs from \\"Actung Baby\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\".
0312263120|1.0|I picked this book up for some beach reading while on vacation.  Unfortunately, for the author, I was just finishing \\"Whirlwind, the last book in Clavell's \\"Asia Series\\" (ie - \\"Shogun\\", \\"Tai Pan\\", \\"Noble House\\", \\"Gai Jin\\", \\"King Rat\\" and \\"Whirlwind\\").  I couldn't help but compare Clavell's incredible level of detail, research, character richness and the mastery of his plot twists with Mr. Brown's work.  Clavell transports you to another place and time, Mr. Brown transports you to a below average comic book.<br />The dialogue is absolutely predictable and flat.  The story begins with an interesting premise - what if someone created an encryption algorithm that the most massive code breaking computer could not break?  The story and characters are unworthy of the premise.<br />Mr. Brown demonstrates an almost absolute ignorance of a procedurally oriented universe.  Who would leave a $2 Billion dollar computer virtually unguarded?  What security official in his right mind would send an amateur to retrieve the \\"pass key\\" to the ultimate encrypter - alone, without support?  What amateur in his right mind would accept such an assignment?  And, Mr. Brown, anti-viral experts are rarely the people that handle soldering equipment in the real world of IT, unless (like me) they are IT managers of small companies.  In big operations, there's a huge gulf between hardware technicians and software technicians, and never do the twain meet.<br />Don't waste your time on this book or money on this book - no doubt, with the success of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", this book will be turned into a forgettable movie that you can rent sometime within the next two years...
B000056Q81|5.0|Some say that Francoise recorded her best music after she left Vogue in 1967, but this compilation covering her early music from 1962 to 1967 is of a consistently high quality with presentation to match. Regardless of the quality of her later music, the music here is what she is best remembered for. Francoise wrote most of her own material. Her voice had a limited range but Francoise knew that and wrote her songs accordingly and any lack of range was compensated by quality. She recorded English versions of some of her songs but none of those are included here. All fifty songs here are in French. Because I don't know any French, I don't understand the words but when music is this good, it's worth hearing anyway.<br />Francoise was clearly influenced by many different styles. Folk-pop is perhaps the main style but you will also hear elements of rock'n'roll, R+B and country here and there, as well as the influences of her own French heritage. The set opens with her debut hit, Tous les garcons et les filles, which sold over two million copes in France. In those days, France did not bother much with singles or albums - records were four-track EP's. Subsequent EP's all did well without matching the success of her debut. In 1964, Francoise moved to London and was rewarded with a UK top twenty hit - All over the world - here in its French version as Danse le monde entire, which opens the second CD. The Seekers also recorded the song and I wonder how big a hit it would have been if their version had been released as a single instead of Francoise's.<br />In the sixties, Francoise spent some time socializing with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. While her music is not as important as theirs, it has a certain Gallic charm all of its own.
0385512104|5.0|I devoured this book in two sittings, allowing less than 24 hours to pass between the first and last pages.<br />I think the trick is the use of autistic narritive.  The chapters are very short, even the long ones.  Also, almost every other chapter is a tangent to what's happening, \\"downtime,\\" as it were.  The pacing is very close to the way autistic people pace themselves.  It prevents the reader from being overstimulated by the action taking place, yet is also interesting enough on its own to prevent the reader from being understimulated.  I would recommend this book to both autists and neurotypicals alike.
B000002UAI|5.0|This, their fourth album, is similar to Please please me and With the Beatles in its general style, featuring a mix of covers and originals. The covers remind us all of the singers who inspired the Beatles - this time it's Carl Perkins, Little Richard, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry.<br />The original songs include three songs that were considered for UK singles release but weren't. Eight days a week was released as a single in America, where it went to number one. The other two, No reply and I'm a loser, were not released as singles anywhere as far as I know. I don't want to spoil the party is (by Beatles standards) generally overlooked, but Rosanne Cash covered it and took it to the top of the country charts in the eighties. It was the first cover of a Beatles song to top the country charts and may still be the only one. I'll follow the sun and Baby's in black are other brilliant originals.<br />This album was the last of its kind. Subsequent album took the Beatles away from their roots as they experimented with different sounds and styles. To some people, that's when the Beatles became interesting, but I enjoy all their music. If you enjoy their early music, you'll love this album.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I was extremely disappointed that season five ran only eight episodes.  I was especially unhappy to learn this only AFTER I bought the DVD.  However, I did get it on sale, and considering the price of renting at Blockbuster helped me to stay relatively calm.  After getting over my disappointment at the length, I savored each and every episode.  I thought all of them were magnificent; this season I began to really see inside the characters.  The actresses have come such a long way; watching season one episodes and comparing them to season five, I could see such a growth in their acting abilities.  The writers seem to have found the perfect balance in season five, as well.  They balance just the perfect amount of bawdy sexuality with heart-wrenching emotion in these episodes.  And watching Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon glow in their pregnancies (and struggle to hide them on screen), I was perfectly happy to give them a break.  They don't owe us episodes of our favorite show.  I was just happy to be able to enjoy them, and grateful to them for bringing us even eight episodes, considering all they were juggling.  A true Sex and the City lover will savor season five all the more for its brevity.
B000093BDX|5.0|So many of their songs are well known, and not just to those who were raised on this music, but to people of all ages. Part of the reason may be that surf music is inextricably linked with the sixties - you won't find any modern equivalent.<br />On this American compilation, you get the classic songs they wrote themselves - California girls, Fun fun fun, Good vibrations, Little deuce coupe, Help me Rhonda, God only knows, Darlin', I get around and Wouldn't it be nice to name just a few - together with songs that they covered in their own unique way - Do you wanna dance and Sloop John B.<br />There have been plenty of compilations of their music down the years and will be many more. Given the number of classic songs they recorded, picking just thirty inevitably means that some great songs get left out. A 30 track compilation released in the UK in 2003 contained 24 of the 30 tracks available here - the other six tracks being Little Honda, Then I kissed her, Caroline no, Break away, Cotton fields and Lady Lynda, instead of Shut down, Be true to your school, In your room, Getcha back, Come go with me and Good timing. Clearly, there isn't a lot to choose between the two, so I recommend that you just buy your local version.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys had a lofty start with grammys and sales and airplay out the ying yang in 2001 with her Debut Songs in A Minor.  However besides the wildly popular singles Fallin and A Womans Worth and Girlfriend, the album lacked flucidness.  It bored me to tears and apparantly the NARAS thought so too as she was nominated for all of the major Grammy awards except Album of the Year.  Well Alicia appears to have attempted to correct that problem with her second release The Diary of . . . <BR>OK so this concept has been done before and honestly as i listened to the album I didnt feel it was a diary as much as a bunch of personal songs nonetheless, She has some very strong moments here.  The intro is carboned from her 1st album which i loved anyway so i was happy skip tracks two and three and then . . . If I were your woman . . . She doesnt attempt to outsing or better Gladys Knight or Stephanie Mills and in fact sounds a little hoarse, but that adds character to the song which comes through as feeling and realness and for that the song gets a 10.  Then the first single which took a while to grow on me but by the time i saw the video . . . It became a constant on my playlist.  You Don't Know My Name is a very relaxed and creative song.  Go on Alicia.  If I Aint Got You is the best song on the album.  The lyrics, The Vocals, and the production are A+ work.  This is Alicia at her absolute best and why she is among the leading talents today.  Go on Alicia The Next song, I think is called secrets . . . Awesome and ends as a dueling duet with some dude awesome song.  The rest of the album is . . . alright at best but those four songs are very strong and in an emerging era where you buy a CD and 2 tracks are worth listening to 5 very strong tracks is considered a good job<br />8 out of 10

B000002H33|5.0|After listening to this CD from start to finish, its easy to see how Metallica got to be the metal Gods they are. Its hard to come up with any other bands that come close musically, lyrically, and in all out metal. My personal favorite on this album is, \\"Damage Inc.,\\" but \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Disposable Heros,\\" are close seconds--very close. If you want the best, the hardest, and the most rockin', then go for the best--Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\"!
B0000C5RQF|5.0|This production of Mozart's masterpiece is a very refreshing and innovative concept. Veteran British conductor Sir Colin Davis leads his orchestra in a live performance at London's celebrated Covent Garden. In my personal opinion, this interpretation of The Magic Flute ranks alongside the high-quality Bergman opera film which was made in Stockholm and sung in Danish the 70's. This production seems to be either 80's or 90's. The sets and costumes were designed to look 18th century (the time of Mozart) and many of the Enlightenment/Freemason iconography is conveniently used. Sarastro (Selig)looks like a majestic Benjamin Franklin, the Temple looks like a Masonic Temple, there are models of the solar system and hot-air balloons, not to mention the costumes and wigs appear authentic to the period this opera was first composed. Anyhow, it's obvious there are limits to the use of creativity in this production (probably due to a low budget)- the Serpent that persues Tamino as the opera opens is nothing more than a large puppet visably operated by people. This would be like the discovery of the Wizard Of Oz' fake illusion-machine at the end of The Wizard of Oz. Disappointing also is the finale in which the Queen of the Night is not killed or visably destroyed (in other versions she melts with the sun's rays or simply drops dead) but in this production she simply exits stage left.<br /> There is very little lighting and much of the opera is pitched against Rembrandt-like darkness. Light is cast only on the focus of certain scenes- the pillars of the Temple, the bed Pamina is sleeping in, etc. A fog machine is used to make the Three Ladies mysteriously appear. The Queen of the Night is welcomed with a prop of a mooon and stars. Even like this, the opera is enjoyable. It is avant-garde and theatrical. The singers are in good shape, even the nearly retired bass Richard Van Allan. Dorothea Roschmann performs a beautifully mature Pamina, passive but strong when necessary (remember she says to Tamino during the Trial of Fire and Water that SHE will lead the way while he plays his magic flute) and she is glorified along with him at the end of the ordeal. Diana Damrau sings a terric Queen of the Night. Her acting combines with her singing so blissfully that she is one of the rare interpreters of the role that don't look bad playing the Queen. Other than Damrau, Edda Moser does a superior job. Damrau's coloratura is dead-on in the high F's, and her villainous scheming and vindictive persona is almost cartoonish what with her costume and make up. Tamino (tenor Hartmann) does a good job with what he has- as far as lyric German singing and the little acting he has to do as the heroic and romantic lead. This DVD comes with commentary by Sir Colin Davis as he talks about The Magic Flute and its significance in music as well as a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of this production. This opera is visually striking. Get it if you are a fan of The Magic Flute and if you want to look at the little visual displays that make this a delightful rendition. Examples I can give are the funny moments that include Papageno-especially his final scene in which he meets Papagena, who comes to him looking like a rather fat Madonna or Cindy Lauper on a rotating bed. Loads of fun.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|This was not my first SACD purchase, but it's the one I'm most satisfied with to date. I'll assume you're familiar with the original recording, agree with me that it is one of the most significant rock albums of all time and give you the reasons why I think should you pick this up in addition to your vinyl or '96 CD remaster. First and foremost, there's the superb 5.1 surround mix. (Some performances were just meant to be heard in surround sound, and probably would have been mixed that way had the technology been available.) Done by Pete Townshend himself using the original 8-track master, this new mix has startling clarity and definition, and presents most of the vocals without reverb or echo. Listening to it, I felt as if I were sitting on the studio floor while the band was recording around me. The wealth of additional material on the second disc includes a studio version of \\"Young Man Blues\\" as well as songs left off the original release, alternate takes and instrumental only tracks. Also included are several of Townshend's laboriously made home demos, which give greater insight into the creative process behind the Who's repetoire and the development of this milestone album. The booklet provided features an informative essay and candid snapshots of the band and producer Kit Lambert taken during the recording sessions.<br />Something I learned reading the essay that might be of interest to those of you who don't own a SACD capable system is that the original master of \\"Tommy\\" had been missing and presumed destroyed, and that previous CDs had been mastered from an alternate 'sweetened' by Kit Lambert. While remixing this project, Townshend discovered the original master tape, and used it for the stereo SACD and CD mixes included here, so for the first time on CD, you can now hear the mix the band signed off on back in 1969.
B000001FMX|5.0|Some of these reviews make me sick. \\"only buy this for historical value\\"...\\"if you like glam or punk buy this\\". Listen,do you like your rock raunchy or clean?--that's all you need to know.As for glam,someone who loves Bowie and T Rex wouldn't necessarily give this album more than one spin. Also, if the power pop side of \\"punk\\" is your thing-Jam,Clash(yes Clash--sorry there's not a lot of serious rockin' goin' on there)- this may seem unpolished and hard to swallow. However, if you are a fan of rock you can strut and dance to like the Stones' \\"brown sugar\\" , or \\"jumpin'jack flash\\"(and the nasty guitar runs and leads)you could dig this music a lot and find that it is the coolest thing you've come across in quite a while. Yes,it is similar to the Stooges(especially the ultra raunchiness of RAW POWER and the other recently released stuff from 1972),-but if you know that then chances are you know this and \\"understand\\" it. The problem is that some people don't know much about \\"music\\",they know what they like,but they don't know what it's about.
B00005LOLD|5.0|4 1/2 stars<br />Shakespeare's rule - \\"happy ending, comedy; unhappy ending, tragedy\\" - does not apply to Sayonara. It is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.<br />Set in Japan in 1951, towards the end of the U.S. occupation, and during the Korean War, Sayonara tells of American men thousands of miles away from home, and the forbidden Japanese women they meet, and fall in love with.<br />At the time, servicemen were forbidden from fraternizing with Japanese women, but like the song says, \\"If you can't be/With the one you love/Well, then, love the one you're with.\\" And in all fairness, many a G.I. met the love of his life while in uniform on foreign soil.<br />The story sets up a parallel between two rigidly hierarchical, intolerant societies: The U.S. Army and Japan.<br />Marlon Brando plays Maj. Lloyd \\"Ace\\" Gruver, the reigning ace and golden boy of the Army Air Force. \\"Ace\\" is the son of a four-star general, and destined himself for general officer status, as long as he plays by the rules. Gruver is an amiably racist Southerner whose world is about to be turned upside down. (One glaring historical error in Sayonara, is its making Gruver a flier in the Army Air Force. The Army Air Force ceased to exist in 1947, when it became the fully independent branch, the U.S. Air Force. The error may have been deliberate, since a brand, spanking new service branch could not be depicted as bound to tradition.)<br />Gruver is confronted with racial conflict through one of his men, Airman Joe \\"Red\\" Kelly (played by carrot-topped Jew, Red Buttons). Red asks Gruver, his C.O., to witness his marriage. Gruver does not seek to hide his racism, and as per Army regulations, seeks to talk Kelly out of the union. He emphasizes that Kelly will not be able to take his wife stateside with him, should he be assigned to return home. Kelly says he will never leave the woman he loves, and demands and receives an apology from the officer. This scene is designed to set up the conflict to come, and to show Gruver's profound decency, and the loyalty he feels to his men. In Japan, Gruver witnesses the wedding, and even kisses the bride.<br />Japan is a traditional society and Gruver, the product of Army tradition, is himself locked in a semi-arranged marriage to a three-star general's daughter, a wonderful, intelligent, beautiful young woman (\\"Eileen Webster,\\" played by Patricia Owens). But is he really in love with her?<br />Gruver becomes smitten with Japan's most famous musical actress, \\"Hana-ogi\\" (Miiko Taka), and pursues her. Meanwhile, his fiancé becomes attracted to the country's greatest kabuki actor (\\"Nakamura,\\" played by Ricardo Montalban, an Hispanic; imagine the reaction by Asian ethnic hustlers to such casting today!).<br />Meanwhile, a racist colonel decides to make the lives of soldiers who have fallen in love with Japanese girls a living hell.<br />Sayonara was up for a heap of Oscars, but only won two. It lost out on most of the awards, because it was up against The Bridge on the River Kwai, another movie about the collision of Japan and the West, which happened to be one of the greatest movies ever made. The two Oscars Sayonara did win, went to Red Buttons and Miyeshi Umeki (as Red Kelly's Japanese bride, \\"Katsumi\\"), as Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. As moving as these two performers were, I'm not sure Buttons deserved the award over Sessue Hayakawa's performance as Col. Saito in Kwai. However, without giving away too much, the circumstances of Buttons and Umeki's performances won them their Oscars, just as much as their performances did.<br />Sayonara is filled out by a congenial performance by a young James Garner, as Marine Corps \\"Capt. Mike Bailey,\\" who befriends Gruver, and workmanlike performances by Martha Scott and Kent Smith as Gruver's prospective mother-in-law and her spineless husband, and Douglass Watson as the racist colonel, respectively. While modestly effective in her more intimate scenes, Miiko Taka performs with much more self-assurance in her musical stage numbers.<br />In 1957, Marlon Brando was on top of the world. Having not yet suffered the egotistical meltdown that would make him both personally and professionally unreliable for the rest of his career (see Apocalypse Now, etc.), at the time he could play anything but Shakespeare.<br />There is clearly a liberal message here: We can triumph over racism, if we can reach through to the core decency of people who were raised in a racist culture. And I believe that Sayonara went too easy on the Japanese, who at their best were as racist as we were, at our worst.<br />Either you will feel bullied by Sayonara's underlying liberal pieties, or it will break your heart. It broke mine.<br />P.S. The barebones DVD contains only the 1957 theatrical trailer.<br />Originally published on November 29, 2003, in The Critical Critic.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop Doggy Dogg took us on a journey in this record. He goes everywhere. All of the songs are good, and some don't get the props they deserve simply because they are next to the songs that are so revolutionary. Dr. Dre's beats and Snoop's style were a combination that has never been duplicated. The bar is set so high that Dre and Snoop haven't even been able to get back to this rare air. <br />A cocky young Snoop Dogg with a smooth style is your tour guide. This is the best Snoop. This is the realest Snoop. This is Snoop minus the bullsh *t He has no cornrows, no straightened hair, no funky experimental rap styles - only the Dogg. He does it so well. Not only are the songs some of the best ever, but Doggytyle's videos changed the rap music in a way that The Chronic's really didn't. <br />Back in '94, Snoop penetrated with \\"Gin and Juice\\". The song and the video are some of the best ever. I half-heartedly looked for the CD with no success. Nonetheless the song had a powerful affect. The video, even more so. The chorus and the beat is smooth as hell, and Snoop puts it down flawlessly. While it's just a party song, it's a fu* king anthem. Additionally, the video is still hilarious to this day. Snoop comes off as the ultimate g. It's also the first appearance of Lil' Bow Wow. (I only wish it were the last). I'm not going to diagnose it for you. If you don't get it, I don't know what to tell you.<br />\\"Murder was the Case\\" is the song where Snoop goes a bit further. The song is one of the greatest ever. It's my favorite song on the CD, and I would argue that Snoop never made it past this level. The beat is so ominous and the lyrics are tight. The ominous voice from the beyond and Snoop's cocky youthful rapping make this song one for the ages.<br />The \\"Who Am I (What's My Name)\\" video and the song come together as a package deal with the album. Using technology in a rap video was a huge step. This is one of the first truly advanced rap video. It features Snoop turning into a dog, and him running from the 'Doggcatchers'. The flashy in your face beat along with Snoop's mocking taunts puts him on the map. The song's beat is one of Dre's best ever (I just LOVE it), lyrics are meaningful, and the rhyming is tight as hell. This is simply an amazingly definitive song. <br />Those are all of the absolutely mind blowing songs. Other songs that would be considered major efforts if they were on other albums are: \\"Tha Shiznit\\", \\"Ain't No Fun\\", \\"Doggy Dogg World\\", and \\"Serial Killa\\". When I put this CD in I just sit back and let it play. It's an experience and it never gets old. This is my, rap_lunatic's, favorite album of all time. I look forward to so many tracks. There is never a time when I want to skip a few tracks ahead to get to the track I really want to hear.<br />I think this is stronger than Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\", overall. I prefer this album to most anything. While there are absolutely no social value in this album, you can't blame Snoop for it. Snoop is not a political rapper. If that's what you are looking for on a Snoop's record, you don't feel him.<br />Doggystyle is just possibly the greatest album ever. All I can do is stand back and applaud this record. I still hear it blaring out of my car to this day. <br />So, if I have to tell you why you sould buy this album, you must be on an isolated island eating through raw fishes.<br />P.S. Snoop's underrated but very tight album, \\"Tha Doggfather\\", is also not to be forgotten.
B00007E8V4|5.0|The world of heavy metal has fallen on dark times. That much is true. Artists forget the true meaning of metal and have wandered into alternative. System of a Down breathes life back into the forgotten ruins with their new album. For those offended by the cursing, I have a message. Metal was never meant to be safe. These guys have a lot to say. With creativity and inordinate musical talent, SOAD blends heavy, heavy rock with a message. A message against war. Don't worry, it's not pressuring opinion, it's just expressing it. Absolutely perfect music. Genious. Pure Genious.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|After a few years aways from her music career, Sarah is a bit of rusty in songwriting and production.  If you are trying to find substantially new sound or even the same level of music creativity, you would be disappointed.  If you are a die-hard Sarah fan who wants the CD to complete your collection, like me, buy it.  If not, just listen to the ones played on the radio.
B00005JMCT|2.0|American Wedding is the third film in this series of comedies and in this episode Jim (Jason Biggs) is tying to tie the knot with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan).  Knowing Jim from the previous films, the story is about to go wrong somewhere and it does so right from the beginning when Jim is about to pop the question.  In the shadow of continuous blunders, Jim's father (Eugene Levy) is spicing up the slap-stick humor with his intentional good-will.  Despite the jokes, the story falls flat on it's face because it consists of one silly joke on top of another which prevents it from taking off.  In the end the audience will have had several belly-aching laughs, but is left with an empty cinematic experience.

B00007LL7O|4.0|So you can understand my view, I'm a \\"true\\" metal/power metal fan, but this is my first Stratovarius album.  I cannot compare this to Stratovarius' other albums, so my opinion on this is unbiased.  My first impression of this album was that it was just OK.  Now if I'm not totally hooked on an album right away, I tend to not listen to it too often.  But the more I listened to it the more I liked it.  Kotipelto's vocals are very good, and absolutly amazing when he is singing Kiske era Helloween-esqe songs like Find Your Own Voice and Learning To Fly.  The guitar work is also amazing.  Now this album is definetly not perfect.  It's either amazing or not very good, fortunatly it's very good most of the time.  The only song that I really don't like is Fantasia.  Papillon, Elements, and A Drop In The Ocean are good, but not anything to rave about.  Stratofortress is a great instrumental track and Soul Of A Vagabond is also on the same plane.  The real gems are Eagleheart, Find Your Own Voice, and Learning to Fly.  Find Your Own Voice and Learning To fly being my favorites (probably due to them resembling Helloween so much, and god knows I love Helloween), these songs are amazing and touch your soul like Power Metal should.  <br />All in all, it's worth the buy.  I enjoy it very much and am looking forward to more Stratovarius, especially since I heard that other albums are much better than this.
B00003CXE7|2.0|\\"Gladiator\\" is an astonishing success -- and by that I mean that I am astonished by the level of success this mediocre flick has attained.<br />Why are people so enamored of this film? Why was it even made? Clearly spurred on by the fortunes of the ultra-realistic \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (which is infinitely better than this movie), \\"Gladiator\\" is a long, dull, boring slog through action sequences we've seen before in other, better movies.<br />The obvious CGI is ugly, the photography dank and dark, the script ridden with cliches and the performances as stiff as nails -- including the lead performance of Russell Crowe, who is about as dour, joyless and inert as any actor I've ever seen in any movie. Mel Gibson played a similar character in \\"Braveheart\\" (lone man takes on the aristocracy to avenge the death of his wife), but with much more verve and energy than Crowe musters here. Crowe is a complete flop in this movie.<br />But, people love it. It won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (over \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger\\"!). I remain baffled by the money and the kudos spent on this movie.
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is a wonderfully written thriller that seeks to excite the senses of its reader. The story weaving is both flowing and interesting at the same time. In this book, Brown also managed to combine important details within a fast moving, action packed book.<br />Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor, receives a telephone call late at night while on business in Paris. It is revealed that the curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, has been murdered in a brutal fashion. This single incident ignites an electrifying chain of events - and Robert finds himself in the middle of all of it. Together with a French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, he sets out on a trail of discovery and back into the very roots of history.<br />Fact or fiction? Readers need to discern for themselves the actual facts within this book. Fact and fiction are so cleverly blended together by the author as he creates scenarios that will take his readers for a ride throughout the streets of France and London. I had to check up on various things in the book to make sure they were true - and many of them were.<br />I personally found the book very interesting, with all its riddles, works of art (by Da Vinci) and edge of the seat plot. However, some parts of the story are too far fetched to be true to real-life scenarios. For example, it seems far too incredible that Langdon and Sophie manage to escape the vices of the French police at every turn - with all their sophisticated technologies and such. But of course, I tend to ignore that flaw because a part of it is a work of fiction. Secondly, the author tends to repeat the same idea over and over again. Readers are given doses of the importance of the \\"Sacred Feminine\\" every few chapters and it gets worse towards the end. Is the need to enforce the \\"Sacred Feminine\\" so important that it needs to be spoon fed? I think not. Also, the connections made with the feminine `chalice' and various existent icons become more vague and incoherent towards the end of this book. Thirdly, Brown makes some claims that cannot be regarded as real evidence. After all Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Sion, and what he believed had happened two thousand years ago cannot be regarded as historic fact yet.<br />All in all, this book is still a great read. The factual references are great - I have to say I've learnt quite a bit about iconology in history and the links that it has with today. It's a book not to be taken too seriously, but purely as a fantastic thriller not to be missed.end of this book. Thirdly, Brown makes some claims that cannot be regarded as real evidence.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Similar to \\"Spun\\" and \\"Salton Sea\\", this film depicts the harrowing lives of drug addicts.  The plot centers around three people whose lives are slowly shattered by their addictions.  The direction is moody and intense, with brilliant imagery which was copied in the more mainstream \\"Spun\\".<br />This film has some extremely disturbing parts and should not be viewed by kids.  I wholly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys intense and realistic dramas.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Of course, true Gabriel fans would never be content with a random compilation of new and old Gabriel songs with very little album coherance. I bought the album after being influenced by a combination of sndtrks. Hearing 'Solsbury Hill' on the 2 sndtrks it was featured on in the past couple of years and watching John Cusack hold the boombox over his head blaring \\"In Your Eyes\\" and standing underneath of his girl's second story window (I think Gabriel's found a friend in Cameron Crowe). Between these two, I couldn't possibly live in ignorance of Peter Gabriel music any longer. Anyway, this is a good record to help you get acquainted with him. Then after that, you'll fall in love and just keep buying records.
B00005JMCN|4.0|This was a decent movie. Somewhat predictable, but enjoyable. Take \\"Chariots of Fire\\" and mix in a little \\"Black Beauty\\" and you get the drift. The acting is good, but not remarkable. The sound is good, as is the editing. A good \\"little engine that could\\" movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Sci-fi and this was fun! The characters are well rounded and have background that is not just added at that last second. The stories are well done and keep you watching til the end. I really hope that they make more :)
B00005JMGL|5.0|This was a very good movie. It is by far the closest rendition of J.M. Barrie's original story of Peter Pan. I went to see this movie because I wanted to see Jason Isaacs characterizations of Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. He was flawless. Jeremy Sumpter was perfectly cast as Peter Pan. To me the book is about growing up. The fight between Captain Hook and Peter Pan is really about Wendy's fears of this. Had Captain Hook won, the Wendy as a child would have died. Neverland would cease to exist. When she returns home Peter Pan won't return with her.  This is the only way the story could end. Wendy is the one that is making the choice to let go of her childhood fantasies. But of course she doesn't totally let go of it. Peter Pan is still alive.<BR>The movie shows the fantasy of Neverland beautifully. It has Indians, Pirates, Fairies, Mermaids, and a Ticking Crocodile. Plus there is a dog as a nanny. The characters have more depth and emotion to them than the other versions that have been made. All of the Peter Pans have been good to watch and are entertaining. However, this movie is the best at depicting the story of Peter Pan. There are moments of the book that have been left out of the movie that I had hoped were there. But the story is still fantastic to watch.  I would recommend seeing this movie.

B00006CXXU|5.0|When you first look at this album you think &quot;stripped how convenient just what Christina Aguilera would call her album&quot;.  However this assumption about this album is not true it is more like her emotions are being stripped down and shown to the world this is a very powerful and touching album.  Which, uncovers her true feelings about her life that has sad aspects to it.  Christina Aguilera's voice is also original and her music has a flare of her own that she puts into her song.  This is her best album yet and should be appreciated by audiences the world over.
0385504209|5.0|I encourage anyone who reads this book to do so with an open mind.  Whether the historical facts related within are actual truth or not, that does not take away from the fact that this is a good book.  The pace is fast and what Brown relates interesting.  I particularly like the idea of the sacred feminine and the secrets behind Da Vinci's paintings. As a Christian, this did encourage me to explore further the history of Christianity and the Catholic faith.
B00005JMTN|4.0|I have to say I really enjoyed Big Fish.  And I don't normally enjoy movies that make me cry!  There were some parts I didn't quite like, but overall I thought it was a great movie - one of Tim Burton's better movies (way better than Planet of the Apes, by far!).<br />The basic story is that Edward Bloom (young version played by Ewan Mcgregor, old version played by Albert Finney) is a story-teller.  He's always got a tall tale to tell.  He's loved his adventurous life and tells everyone about it whenever he can.  This has driven his son, William (Billy Crudup) crazy over the years.  He feels like he doesn't know who his father is.  The movie takes place during the time when Edward is dying and William has to come to terms with it.  William wants to know who his father really is, but can't seem to get Edward to tell him the \\"truth.\\"  William is frustrated by Edward's tall tales, thinking they're just a bunch of lies.<br />William's young pregnant wife comes with him to visit while Edward is dying, so he starts spinning tales for her about his life story. This is the other half of the movie, where you get to see Edward's life as he is growing up and going on all sorts of crazy adventures.  The flashbacks and stories of Edward's life are so intruging and beautifully filmed.  Edward runs in to all sorts of crazy people including a witch with a glass eye that shows you how you will die, a town where everyone is barefoot and happy, a giant named Karl, siamese twin sisters who sing and all sorts of other interesting characters.  Again, the fantasy scenes of this movie are incredibly moving and visually stunning.<br />The acting was phenominal as well in this movie - I especially enjoyed Ewan McGregor as the adventurous young Edward.  He was completely believeable and created such a fun and interesting character to watch on screen.  Albert Finney was also wonderful as the older Edward, spinning tall tales to anyone who would listen.  Several supporting actors/actresses did a great job as well, especially Jessica Lange as older Edward's wife, Danny DeVito as the eccentric carnival owner, Helena Bonham-Carter as the witch/Jenny from Spectre and so many others.<br />While I did enjoy the film, I didn't quite understand the son, William.  I have relatives who spin tall tales all the time and I find it charming and fun.  William was stuffy and completely unlikeable, even at the end of the movie.  While I thought the acting by Billy Crudup was good, I just plain didn't like the character and didn't really believe that a son would have that much animosity towards his dad just because his dad was a storyteller.<br />Other than that, I thought the movie was wonderful.  I still highly recommend seeing it, it's just a beautiful fun story, despite being a bit of a tear-jerker at some points.  The acting is superb, the music is great, the sets and cinematography are wonderful.  It's a great film, one of the best I've seen this year.d a great job as well, especially Jessica Lange as older Edward's wife, Danny DeVito as the eccentric carnival owner, Helena Bonham-Carter as the witch/Jenny from Spectre and so many others.<br />While I did enjoy the film, I didn't quite understand the son, William.

B00005221M|5.0|I've been shocked to read some of the negative many reviews of the Extended DVD version of this amazing film.  I'm a great admirer of Michael Mann's work and find it incredible that he would knowingly sully his own reputation by the alleged butchery that has been perpetrated on the movie in this particular release.<BR>However, those disappointed viewers will be pleased to hear that Warner Home Video released the original uncut, un-added-to theatrical version (as far as I can tell) of &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; on DVD in Australia in November 2001 (of which I own a treasured copy).<BR>It is in Dolby Surround 5.1 with interactive menus, subtitles, a music only track and runs 108 minutes.<BR>It is still available from several reputable Australian online stores such as ezydvd.com.au and hmv.com.au.  So, if you have a multi-region player and don't mind a Region 4 copy, then you should now be able to assuage the frustration of not having the original version.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|&quot;Memento&quot; can obviously be described in many ways.  I see it pretty much as a mind boggling and extremely original movie that is extraordinarily inventive in how it's told.  From the very beginning or should I say the very end of this film to the end or was it the beginning, this film will lead you in the process of here's how it ended and now let's work out how we got there.  I simply cannot think of any other film that I've seen that has been portrayed in such a manner and oddly enough, it works wonderfully for this thriller.<br />Simply put, to make this movie work, it had to take some of Hollywood's best on screen talents and that is exactly what the producers of this film came up with.  Guy Pearce's performance as a man who cannot make new memories is stunning to say the least.  The ever beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss of &quot;Matrix&quot; fame performs brilliantly, showing that she definitely has talents outside of the &quot;Matrix.&quot;  Joe Pantoliano, most recently acclaimed for his performance during his stint on &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; performs exceptionally well in this film, just showing that he gets better and better with every role.<br />The movie was based on an original short story by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan took it and ran with it, culminating in this extremely intriguing revenge thriller.  Christopher Nolan most certainly deserves all the praise and accolades he has and continues to receive for the originality of concept in the screenplay and his directing performance of this film.<br />The Premise:<br />Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a rather odd individual who at one point seemingly had the perfect life with his wife yet one day that came crashing down on him when he awoke and found men attempting to rape and kill his wife.  During that incident he struck his head on the wall and has, since that time, not been able to make any new memories.  What follows from there is an intriguing tale in which Leonard, who is constantlytaking Polaroid snapshots, making notes and doing self tattoo's to remind him of the &quot;facts,&quot; attempts to seek revenge upon the person responsible for his wife's death...<br />I would definitely recommend this mind boggling, well told revenge thriller for any and all who are interested in this type of film, Guy Pearce's performance alone makes this film one to watch!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan<BR>-Theatrical Trailer and TV Spot<BR>-&quot;Following&quot; Trailer<BR>-Tattoo Gallery<BR>-Director &amp; Cast Biographies
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I read the reviews.  I was discouraged.  I thought it over.  I eventually bought the album anyway.  I smacked myself for almost missing out on DT's most honest and intense album since &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; - their first album (that most here have probably never even heard of).  Those who have panned the CD just don't understand DT.  Those are undoubtedly the same people who loved the pseudo-pop tracks on Images and Awake.  It simply does not matter that the guitar is a little grungier, or the pace a little thrashier - it's all about the delicious and glorious merger of beauty and complexity.  It is true, the riffs are hard.  But if you can get over that, you will realize that they describe all of the same (if not better) off-time harmony and precision that DT is master of.<br />Since their first album, after having lost their lead singer, it seems to me as if they have tried (with varying degrees of success) to cram LaBrie into a role that he is clearly not suited for - progressive rock singer.  Here is an album that finally suits LaBrie...that I can actually listen to without cringing every time he tries to screech falsetto over progressive melodies.  That is why I call this album &quot;honest.&quot;  I think it is DT finally playing as a complete band, and not a prog-metal band with a thrash singer.<br />If you call yourself a prog-metal fan this one simply can not be missed.<br />PS - it's great for exercising to as well ;)
B00003CX95|5.0|&quot;Braveheart&quot; is quite simply, one of the best and most successful movies ever created and a huge part of that success comes from the efforts extended by Mel Gibson, as he wore three different hats for this masterpiece, those being producer, director and star.  The one oddity about this movie for me was that I pretty much wore out my VHS copy of it and had, a couple years ago, purchased the DVD but only just recently took the opportunity to watch it again and no matter how many times you watch this movie, it is still a stunning, compelling and extraordinarily intriguing film that draws you in to the life of William Wallace despite already knowing how it's going to end.<br />The one thing that drives this movie is the spirit that Mel Gibson puts into his character of William Wallace and it is of no surprise that &quot;Braveheart&quot; won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 1995 and Best Director for Mel Gibson.  The only true surprise was that he wasn't among the top five nominated for or won the Best Actor award.  <br />High praise also goes to the long list of supporting actors and actresses that starred in this superb film!  Most notable was the performance by Sophie Marceau, one of the most beautiful women on the planet.  Patrick McGoohan was absolutely incredible in the role of the villain Longshanks, King Edward I, delivering a memorable performance.<br />One of the most notable performances in this film, among the many, was the work done by James Horner who was responsible for the score.  As is normally the case when his name appears in the credits, everything about the score, from the first reel to the last, is incredibly well blended into the movie and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of the movie.<br />The Premise:<br />As the old saying goes, is it Hollywood or History?  The truth is, of course it's a bit of history, put together Hollywood style to make one of the best films ever presented to an audience.  The truth behind it is that we'll never know as recorded history from this era is circumspect as best.  Where a huge portion of the credit for this film lays is in the hands of Randall Wallace, a descendant of William Wallace's.<br />As this historic film opens, we see a young William Wallace in Scotland as he's learning the harsh lessons of life in his era.  After his family is killed in battle he's fortunate enough to have his Uncle Argyle (played brilliantly by Brian Cox) take him under his wing!  Several years later he returns home to find that his countrymen are still suffering under the yoke of English oppression but he didn't come home for that, he came home for Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), seeking her hand in marriage.  Unfortunate events unfold from there and William loses the love of his life and goes on a rampage not only to avenge his love but to free his country...<br />What follows from there is not only one of the best films of the nineties but one of the best films of all times.  I highly recommend &quot;Braveheart&quot; to any and all who are interested in seeing what true movie making is about!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-2 Theatrical Trailers<BR>-Commentary by Director Mel Gibson<BR>-A Filmmaker's Passion:  The Making of Braveheart

B0000VAFO0|4.0|I missed this one when it was in the theaters and was patiently awaiting its arrival on the DVD racks and to say the very least, I was not disappointed by it.  \\"Underworld\\" is an outstanding, sleek action thriller with extremely dark undertones that I highly enjoyed watching.  The only detractor for me was the prosthetics and CGI used for the Lycans (werewolves).  Outside of that minor detractor, this films scores on all points, from the overall dark atmosphere to the story telling and to the acting.  <br />While I've seen and read that the professional critics and many others have pretty much panned this movie, if you've not seen it yet, I urge you to give it an open minded try as I believe you will be as surprised by it as I was!  As far as stories go that involve vampires and werewolves, \\"Underworld\\" takes a completely new, intriguing and compelling approach that will hopefully spawn a sequel.<br />Prior to \\"Underworld,\\" the only movie I've ever seen Kate Beckinsale in was \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and I thought her performance in that film was, just what it was, a supporting role that was noticeable but not notable.  Her performance as the lead in an action film of this magnitude is, to say the least, incredible.  She is an extremely gorgeous woman and given the makeup and costumes she's wearing in this film, they only serve to greater enhance her beauty.  Her future performances are definitely to be looked forward to with anticipation.<br />This highly conceptual story was written by Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBride and directed by Len Wiseman.  All of which deserve high praise for their efforts in creating this new spin in the Vampire/Werewolves genre.  The score for the film greatly enhances the overall dark feeling of the movie!<br />The Premise:<br />Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire who is one of the lead warriors in the battle between the vampires and the Lycans (werewolves).  Known as a death bringer by the Lycans, she makes a disturbing discovery while on a mission to bring death to some of the Lycans, a discovery that will lead her down the path to of a highly adventuresome story that is extremely rich in its telling...<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films from this particular genre.  This new spin on the Vampires & Werewolves mythology and Kate Beckinsale's performance makes this film an instant classic in the genre!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Director and Writer Commentary<br />-Technical Commentary<BR>-Creature Effects Featurette<BR>-Music Video:  Finch:  \\"Worms of the Earth\\"<BR>-Making of Underworld<BR>-Sights + Sounds Featurette<BR>-Stunts Featurette<BR>-Storyboard Comparison<BR>-Bonus Trailers (Within these bonus trailers it's wonderful to see that we will be treated to \\"Resident Evil 2\\" sometime during this coming year!)<BR>-TV Spots
0800196767|3.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was about twelve, and loved it. I read the book, and liked it as much, maybe even better. Recently, I rented the movie to see if I would still like it; I didn't. I'm now a lot older, and usually still enjoy the children's literature and films that I read on occation. Not this one. Yes, Mara Wilson is cute, and Danny DeVito does an excellent job, very humorous, too, and Pam Ferris is truly frightening as Miss Trunchbull. Miss Honey is lovable also; I simply didn't experience the sense of magic and wonderment that I'd had as a child. I'd give this film a try, but don't expect to feel as much triumph or hatred, or anything else, as you would if you were ten again.
B000002BE9|5.0|Wow, fabulous debut album for a young girl! I really miss her music and I treasure this album. It's my favorite Fiona album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In The Zone, Britney's 4th album and quite possibly the best 1! Below is my opinion of each track on the album including 3 International Bonus Tracks!<br />1. Me Against The Music - 9/10 - A great first release going no.1 in a few countries, and is all round a great dance song that will get you dancing!<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - 8/10 - Initially a song i didn't like, but it is a grower, giving it time you will see that it is a hot R &amp; B tune that will also get you dancing!<br />3. Showdown - 10/10 - My favourite song on the album, very much a pop song, it has a very cool and catchy chorus and infectious music to go with it.<br />4. Breathe On Me - 8/10 - This is 1 that alot of fans like, but its not really 1 of mine, indeed the only real dance song on the album.... this song tends to get boring after a few listens.<br />5. Early Mornin' - 4/10 - This is the only song on the album i don't like and always skip, a tune produced by moby about the mornin after a hang over, it is not something i enjoy listening too.<br />6. Toxic - 9/10 - My 2nd favourite song on the album, a very good song, but the reason it didn't get 10/10 is because the last set of choruses arn't very long, so the climax is short lived and isn't something that sticks in your head.<br />7. Outrageous - 7/10 - This song full on R &amp; B and has some pretty smart lyrics, but its a shame its so short.<br />8. Touch Of My Hand - 6/10 - the 1 thing letting this song down are the vocals for the chorus, very off putting and make you not wanna listen to the song over and over.<br />9. The Hook Up - 5/10 - It took me a long time to get to like this song, and a short time to not like it again, 2nd worst song on the album besides &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;.<br />10. Shadow - 8/10 - Very Nice ballad, with a nice climax at the end, showing britney's vocal ability.<br />11. Brave New Girl - 7/10 - Many ppl don't believe this song fits on this album... but i think its one of the funkier 1's to dance too, although abit girly, its a fun song to sing along to.<br />12. Everytime - 9/10 - One of britney's best ballads ever, and a potential release, this song proves not only her vocals but writing ability, its a very nice song that is fun to sing along to.<br />13. The Answer - 6/10 - The P.Diddy produced song that is 1 you would like at first, but you tend to get sick of it after a while.<br />14. Don't Hang Up - 6/10 - The most mellow song on the album and is quite reminisant of &quot;Thats Where You Take Me&quot; a nice song to listen to to calm you down.<br />15. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) - 8/10 - A real funky song, that i'm my opinion should have been on the album...

0634049011|5.0|I have read countless testimonials about guitar books that guarantee results I never was able to achieve.  This book actually delivered for me, and it has done so in a big way.  My ambition, which previously eluded me entirely, has been to become fluent on the fretboard--to be able to improvise, follow changes, structure complex chords on the fly and the like.  I tried so long in vain I decided I must just lack the necessary ability.  <br />This book changed all that for me.  I am doing things now I only dreamed of before.  I don't know how the author figured it out, but he has come up with a way to communicate an understanding of music and the fretboard to both your head and, probably more important, your hands.  Simple things like combining diagram exercises and playing, reinforced by having you speak the information out loud, really work to imprint the material on your fingers.  The book walks you one step at a time, fairly painlessly, from simple to very complex.  This thing is a gold mine.  No kidding.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|Wow I was surprised this latino could sing, and good beats to back it up. Good work!
0451191153|5.0|Truthfully, when I opened this book, I had no idea what to <BR>expect. I had heard Ayn Rand and history of writing revolutionary and radical themes, but nothing can really prepare<BR>you for what this story has to offer. The idea is some what<BR>controversial and will either cause the reader to love it or hate it. Personally, I whink this book is masterpiece, otherwise<BR>it wouldn't have lasted all these years without being forgotten like so many other empty and pointless pieces of literature. It is simply a Story of the Glory of Man and shouldn't be critized for any other reason.<BR>      The pertinent characters, Howard Raork, Peter Keatings, Ellsworth Toohey and Domonique are like no characters you will ever read about. Despite there somewhat cold and strange manner <BR>towards life, you can't help but feel fascination towards these <BR>people. They are the extremes of the human nature portrayed in <BR>single individuals and show the reader what human are truly capable of, whether beatiful or truly disgusting. Out of these <BR>characters, one by the name of Howard Roark shines through.<BR>He is the one who symbolizes the glory of human acheivment and how we reached it. This is what the story attempts to and succeeds in portraying. I actually feel sorry for people<BR>who criticize this book becasue they believe characters are cold or the portrayal of love is sick and inaccurate. First of all, Nothing is inaccurate about this book, it's human nature at it's darkest. Secondly this book wasn't written to please people but<BR>to portray a theme about society.<BR>     All I say is give this book a try. If you make it through <BR>the first chapter, then you won't be able to put it down. If you don't without hating it, then don't waste your time.
B000003CMB|2.0|Save your money. It's shamefully sinful that one of the greatest live rock albums ever has been reissued with such total disregard for the form. AFE \\"deluxe\\" reissue--released by Mercury September 2003 & produced by Bill Levenson--can be<BR>nearly unlistenable for those of us who have considered this set the holy grail of live albums. Here's the problem:  Virtually every track is faded out, with no feel of \\"live\\" continuity. I nearly caused a traffic accident when \\"Trouble No More\\" was closing and the final notes were faded out! Then I quickly<BR>scanned through the rest of both discs and found the same treatment throughout. This has got to be right up there with the worst reissuing SNAFUs of all time. Despite some criticism about the mix of the 1992 double-cd _The Fillmore Concerts_ or the edited-out crowd requests before \\"Whipping Post\\" (or was this an alternate version of the song?)or the composite version of \\"...Liz Reed\\", at least that set (which the new reissue<br />mirrors, adding only \\"Midnight Rider\\" and some slight resequencing) felt like a truly live experience from one of the greatest truly live bands.  It's too bad because the recent remastering for \\"deluxe\\" (sic) does seem to capture the thunder and lightning of rock's tightest rhythm section better than most previous versions. Don't waste your money on the overpriced new one ($25-30) unless you're willing to edit, fix, and burn<BR>your own \\"deluxe\\" version. And that won't be easy, either, because of the criminally quick fade-outs and fade-ins that the new set has suffered.  Stick with: 1) Your original 1971 vinyl two-LP release, 2) the hard-to-find (and expensive) half-speed<BR>master vinyl version, 3) the nearly as hard to find--but truest sounding of all--Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab double-cd, 4) the late-90s \\"Capricorn Classics\\" single-disc reissues of _At Fillmore East_ and _Eat a Peach_ or, 5) if you really need most of the songs from these Fillmore East shows in one set, _The Fillmore Concerts_ double disc. Better yet...since most of you probably have this in one form or another already, use the savings from this for gas and beer the next time the Brothers play near your town.
0385504209|2.0|I received this book as a gift, and plowed through it in one week.  Maybe I'm wrong in thinking this, but I think a good book should take a little longer.  It certainly shouldn't take me only a week to read and STILL feel like a chore.  This book should have the subtitle &quot;Alternate History for Dummies&quot;.  It presents a sketchy take on history as fact, and it does so in such a patronizing way that I was just bored.  It is poorly written and poorly plotted.  The action takes place in what should be some very interesting locales, but the author's poor writing ability make London indistinguishable from Paris, and the environments come off bland and uninteresting.  The action may as well take place in an empty warehouse.  I didn't care about the characters or their fates.  The author followed the formula of &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; to an appalling degree, and the result is a book that is weak in comparison (and that book wasn't great, either).  I was not in suspense, and I cannot forgive how patronizing and didactic it was.  The idea that people will use this as a place to get their history scares me.  Why don't I give it one star?  Because I didn't quite hate it.  But I don't like it, either.  Read something else.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I've been awaiting this release since I first heard that this incredible book was being made into a musical by Stephen Schwartz.  Then Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth were announced as the witches and I thought that this could not POSSIBLY fail.  Well, it hasn't failed, but it surely doesn't live up to the reputation of these three artists.<br />The music and lyrics are often uninspired and seem to be stolen melodies from other shows.  The one notable exception to this is &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;.  Idina Menzel's voice is amazing and this song really showcases her talent.  Most of the rest of the music is &quot;cute&quot; but not amazing.  Performers like Chenoweth and Norbert Leo Butz are wasted.  And Joel Grey is a legend, but was a complete disappointment in this recording.<br />I am reviewing this as someone who has not had the opportunity to see the show, but has read this fantastic book by Gregory Maguire.  I was relying on the recording to determine whether I should rush to NY to see this before the Tony's determine whether or not it stays open.  Idina Menzel was the only impressive thing here.
0385504209|4.0|For whatever it's worth!  After much discussion about Dan Brown's hot bestselling novel, I'd like to add some summary statements based upon having read the book.  There's no point in being verbose about this. Yes, I enjoyed the book with reservations. Here are my observations - by Juliana L'Heureux:<br />1.  The Da Vinci Code is an entertaining murder mystery.<br />2.  It's a novel; therefore, it's fiction.<br />3.  Dan Brown is a clever novelist so there's several unexpected twists to the plot, almost all the intrigue stretches to pass the &quot;straight face test&quot; (clever, nonetheless). 4.  Although Dan Brown claims the art history, etc. described is based upon his FACT, he doesn't explain why the paradoxes in The Da Vinci Code were never exposed by the Protestant Reformation.<br />Surely, some people at this point may have made up their mind about The Da Vinci code based upon the reviews and spin off discussions about the book, but without reading it for themselves. Almost everyone who reads The Da Vinci Code enjoys the story. For skeptics who feel the book is<br />(a) too hyped or (2) too heavily weighted towards the sacred feminine- I'd say, &quot;lighten up&quot; and read it for the story value; or- just wait for the movie to be released.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|this moovie was acually very good and it deserves more credit!!!
0807219533|5.0|Our entire family has absolutely loved listening to the unabridged tape of this novel.  The story is engaging, filled with subtle and unexpected humor.  My 17 year old daughter and I enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old son.  The narrator's voice is rich and full of expression.  The tape brought the story to life and provided several terrific hours of enjoyable listening.  We highly recommend it.
6305308659|5.0|\\"Pleasantville\\" is by far one of the most inventive, original, funny, and thought-provoking films to come along in the past decade.  Written and directed by Gary Ross (Seabiscuit, Big) and boasting an all-star cast including Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, Paul Walker, and Jane Kaczmarek \\"Pleasantville\\" hits all the right notes.  Never too preachy, but effectively conveying its timeless message of acceptance and the importance of those who refuse to conform to the society norm.<br />David (Maguire) a dorky, lonely teenager finds safe haven in watching \\"Pleasantville\\", a 1950's black and white soap opera, \\"where everything is just...pleasant\\". His sister Jennifer (Witherspoon) is far more social, and, err, promiscuous than her brother.<br />One night, the two get into a fight over the remote and end up breaking it (David wants to watch the \\"Pleasantville\\" marathon and Jennifer has a hot date).   Just seconds later, a very odd looking repairman shows up and replaces their remote with a very odd-looking one.<br />The two resume their fighting over the new remote and soon find themselves in Pleasantville, as the teenage stars of the show, Bud and Mary-Sue Parker.  They're black and white, living with the show's parents, and are decked out in the traditional 50's garb.  They have actually become characters Pleasantville!<br />David wants to get out of the situation as well as his sister, but whereas he tries to blend in (effortlessly, with his knowledge), she does what she likes (which involves some unspeakable acts at Lover's Lane. One event leads to the other, and suddenly there is a red rose growing in Pleasantville. The more the rules are \\"broken\\" and the more the realization of an outside world grows, the more color begins to seep into Pleasantville.  Books, music, freedom, love, rain... all of these are soon being experienced by the reluctant citizens.  Soon, even people are changing colors!<br />At first, it is all quite comical when you see how Bud and Mary Sue interact with (and disrupt) the people of Pleasantville.  Soon, the close-minded citizens of Pleasantville become uncomfortable with the spreading colors and begin to fear and ostracize those who are in color (a restaurant sign reads \\"No Coloreds\\").  This is where \\"Pleasantville\\" succeeds.  Scenes reminiscent of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", and maybe even \\"The Pianist\\" soon follow.  I do not want to reveal any more than I already have in this review, but let me just say that this is a fascinating and meaningful film not to be missed!
B00005U122|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I was one of those who thought it was arrogant of Waters to try and unilaterally disband Pink Floyd. And I was (and still am) glad they went on without him. But I've got to say that after watching this DVD it becomes clear that Waters was the one with the creative vision for the band. This concert has a certain vitality that seems to be lacking in the glossier Thunder and Pulse videos. I even liked the concert's emphasis on the music rather than the light show. And the cuts from his post Floyd era come across surprisingly well. I say this as someone who never cared much for Roger Waters' solo efforts. However, in light of recent world events, his post Floyd songs seem especially relevant today. Of course it's always been apparent that Pink Floyd never had the same lyrical depth after Roger left the band. The contrast seems even greater in light of this video.<br />If Roger Waters was trying to make a point - Okay, I've got it. Point taken!
B00005Y7AW|5.0|I thought the 90's and the 00's (have we come up with a shortcut-nickname for this decade yet?) would never see the end of rehashed, overdone, and ANNOYING deep gurgly vocals in the new wave of rock/leftover-grunge music.  Now, FINALLY, we get Rufus Wainwright.  Original melodies, interesting chord progressions and creative use of instrumentation are what this recording is all about.  This album is far from predictable.  I still marvel at the interesting variations he uses in both melody and harmony.  The former may be a result of his operatic influence (he's an avid opera fan if you didn't know) though I think that hearing Renee Fleming screaming out any Eb7 cadenzas would be a bit over-the-top on this recording ;-)   I hope Rufus continues in this direction - he's a definite breath of fresh air.  Strongly recommend this album!
B0000VAFNQ|2.0|I thought this would be as good as the Blade movies, but it definitly is NOT. The acting made me sleepy and it was not scary at all.<br />THIS IS A BRITISH MOVIE. So if you didn't like the Tomb Radier movies, then you sure won't like Underworld.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I saw the trailer for this film a few months back, and although I didn't know much about it, I was genuinely impressed. As Big Fish finally came out in theaters, I knew that I'd have to see it. I am so happy that I did.<BR>This beautiful film tells the story of a dying man (Albert Finney) whose son (Billy Crudup) feels as if everything the old man had told him about his life was phoney. As his son tries to piece together all the stories that he was told when he was younger, he begins to figure out that is maybe not all a myth.<BR>When the stories are told, Ewan McGregor plays a younger version of this man, during the 1950s and 1960s. In his fantasy-like adventures, he tells how he encountered a gentle giant, saved the town that he lived in, and met his true love (Alison Lohman) through months of work in a circus to get the ringmaster (Danny DeVito) to tell him more about the girl that he'd seen but did not know. The whole thing ties together in a beautiful way, and this movie you will be sure to love! It is a modern day Wizard of Oz! My Rating-9.2/10!
B00005MP58|5.0|Great movie!  It is the best version of the book that I have ever seen.
0553260111|5.0|First of all: If you don't like this book, I think you're crazy!<BR>Next: Don't expect this book to be like the movie (the book is much better!)<BR>  Okay, this book has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It is about this man, Jason Bourne, who loses his memory and slowly gains it back with the help of this girl, Marie St. Jacques. <BR>   The book is full of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. In fact, I was up past my bedtime by at least three hours every time I tried reading this book!<BR>   However, if you absolutely love this book, I would not recommend watching the movie. It completely ruins the book because it has only two things in common with the book: Jason and Marie.(That's why you shouldn't get dissapointed if you watch the movie and then read the book.)
0385504209|4.0|a tale of anamolous convention that molests the notion of unequivical sanctimonious congruity, but does so with a passion that nearly eclipses that wondrous and loving book titled &quot;what life is all about&quot; by MO.  both, though entirely different, reach and strike at the heart of the human condition. if you don't own both correct your err now.
076790592X|4.0|You can read this book in a few short hours, and it will be one of the best few hours of your life. The book is about how the author, Mitch Albom, reconnected with his favorite college professor when he accidentally came across a Nightline story about the professor, Morrie Schwartz. Morrie had contracted ALS - Lou Gehrig's disease. <br />Albom does a wonderful job of relating his feelings for his professor and relays exactly what Morrie Schwartz wanted him to say. The book teaches you to accept what life gives you, and seek and give love, which is more important than material things. <br />My only problem with the tome is that I am not quite sure that Albom truly believes his beloved teacher. It almost seems at times that Albom was merely reported what Morrie said, rather than agreeing with him. The book comes off as if you are supposed to believe that Morrie was able to change Albom's life, but he has not convinced me that was the case. However, it may very well help you change yours.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a great CD that I think really reflects Christina Aguilera as a person.  She's not doing the pop princess thing or doing what her agent or any exec is saying will sell.  She's just being herself.<br />I love this CD and you'll very find it not in my CD player.  There's something there for anything you are in the mood for, whether it's hip hop or something that's got more of a rock n roll vibe.  And best of all her wonderful voice is heard in every song.  I hope that everything else is as wonderful and real as this is.<br />You can tell in these songs that she's really putting herself out there.  I can't wait to see all the awards this CD is going to get in the future. <br />Oh, and Alicia Keys worked with Christina on #9, Impossible.  It's fantastic and my favorite song on the CD.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Songs In The Key Of Life is an album that will stand the test of time. In my opinion, this was more sprawling than Innervisions, Talking Book, Music Of My Mind, and Fulfillingness' First Finale. On Songs In The Key Of Life, Stevie talks about everything that is going on in the world. He talks about love, racism, violence, and feelings. I feel that it is the almighty peak of his career. If you listen to every track on this album, you can visualize everything he says. I think that \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"I Wish\\", \\"Isn't She Lonely\\" and \\"As\\" are the popular songs on here, possibly the best on here. There is a lot of filler here, though. For instance, \\"Love's In Need Of Love Today\\", \\"Have A Talk With God\\", and \\"Black Man\\" are just for your listening pleasure. My favorite song is \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\". It's maybe the most romantic songs on this masterpiece. There are a lot of guest appearances. Herbie Hancock plays keyboards on \\"As\\", Geogre Benson plays guitar and sings background vocals on \\"Another Star\\", and more artists make appearances. This is maybe one of my favorite double albums. Songs In The Key Of Life explains why Stevie Wonder is considered a genuis. It might be overrated, but it's the greatest Stevie Wonder album of all-time. It has influenced me a whole lot.
B00006BTCA|4.0|After considering Obstacle 1 one of the best songs of the last year and something that made the band seem promissing I included TOTBL in a bundle of cd's I recently bought. Of the group (which also included Tool: Lateralus, The Used, Queens of the Stoneage: Songs for the Deef, AFI: Sing the Sorrow and Cold Play: A Rush of Blood to the Head) I considered this one the best of the bunch. There isn't really a track on here that I didn't like, and that's one of the things that makes this cd so good, but other standouts on the cd include NYC, Untitled, The New, and Leif Erikson. No doubt this is a solid debut and easily one of the best cd's of last year, of course now I will be eagerly anticipating their next effort. If you really like Obstacle 1 or PDA you are almost sure to like the rest of this cd.
6305718954|5.0|This movie is breathtaking and beautiful. The camera work is stunning and the story line is great! I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller's and a good movie! This movie is not for kids because it contains graphic violent sequenes and some sexual content.
B0000E64TR|5.0|If you entered high school in the early seventies, as I did, you will remember how completely Elton John's music permeated the world at that time. When I was fifteen, Elton's early records were so much a part of my life that I could scarcely imagine the universe without them. Although all the early albums were wonderful, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" a massive, two-record set with every song a gem, was the jewel in the crown, the holy grail of every teenaged record collector. It meant to us then, I think, what \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" had meant to kids a few years older than ourselves, in the late sixties. I have owned this album on many different formats during the thirty years since, and heard it literally hundreds of times. Never has it sounded so pristine, so vibrant, and so beautifully defined as it does now. After all this time, I find myself noticing nuances on this reissue that I have never heard before. The thirtieth anniversary edition is a triumph, and a worthy tribute to a timeless classic.
B00005JLR2|1.0|Certainly a much better film than I had anticipated, I thought it was gonna be awful from the look of the trailer. But I was very surprised. I actually didn't mind it in the end, but unlike the previous release, Lilo and Stitch, Treasure Planet lacked the urge to make me want to buy it or watch it again. I love to watch any Disney film that's designed to make people laugh, except for Finding Nemo-that was rubbish, so this film lacked humour, and B.E.N. was more irritable than funny, especially his voice. The rest of the cast is good though, the animation is visually great, as is the soundtrack. But unfortunately, I loved Lilo and Stitch, and this wasn't nearly as good. But I doubt this was ever going to be in the first place.<br />Lilo and Stitch: Excellent, worth buying now!<br />Treasure Planet: Entertaining, worth a rent, but not worth watching more than once.
0790732254|5.0|If one were an actress, Martha would be the meatiest, bitchiest, sexiest, foulest, richest, tastiest, most appalling role she could ever play.<BR>And Elizabeth Taylor plays her to perfection.<br />This is the movie about a middle aged couple (Liz and Richard Burtain)  who love to play strange games.  They thrive on it. They delight in it. Their marriage appears to be based on it.<br />But one night when they have a young couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over for a few cocktails, their little Phychological games get a little dangerous, outrageous, sexually kinky.  <br />I found myself gasping at times, because I could not belive what was unfolding before my eyes...Martha and George find the weakness in people and then begin tearing them apart (Little by Little) until nothing is left. Words can be like razors and cut, cut, cut.  And they do this exceptionally well.<br /> The venom rushes out of their pink mouths as if they are creating a web and then there is no stopping them ....Even sleeping with their sweet, young guests is not out of the question. <br />Martha and Goerge are dysfunction at the highest level, but the writing and acting is so excellent that the audience will feel for them, want to see them redeem themselves, and hope that their marriage will work.<br />Stunning performances by Burtain,Taylor, Dennis, and Segal...But Taylor shines beyond words.
B000001DU5|4.0|I prefer this album to the new VERY BEST OF collection, because that album, although it nicely encompases, but still misses one of the best songs of the post-Curt Smith era songs in \\"God's Mistake\\" as well, that particular album drops the ball on a few particular items.<br />To find out what that might be, check out my review of that album.<br />This album came out at the end of the Roland/Curt partnership and covered all thier very best work of their 80s heyday. One of the very best bands to come out of genre populated by horrible bands as Flock of Seagulls, Duran Duran and Human League, you know, think back to early-mid 80s pop on the charts...yuck..Anyway Tears For Fears was always at thier very best, and on the whole this collection accurately represents that fact. <br />For years I've owned the cassette version and I am currently looking for the CD. I have long losed the liner notes for the cassette but was impressed that they did contain the lyrics to all songs, and I find that very impressive in a Greatest Hits album. As for the songs, all your favs are here, the #1 \\"Everybody Wants To...\\" yes everyone knows the name of this song. \\"Sowing The Seeds\\" one of thier heavier songs, very cool, \\"Shout\\", also a standard, and who could live without \\"Woman In Chains\\", \\"Pale Shelter\\" and \\"I Believe\\" (THE ORIGINAL!)? Playing these songs will literally take you and make you feel like you are back in the 80s, for me it associates with some very good times in my life, times I miss, and these are songs that will never age, and although may sound a bit dated, it is that very thing that makes them so good.<br />Besides a couple of low-key songs, this compilation suffers from two other things, one fault it can't help, the other it definately might have. \\"Mother's Talk\\" is not the better U.S. Remix version, which made the song less jumpy and electronic, gave it more a nice jazzy feel. In other words, I find it to be a whole lot better, and since this album was released in NorthAmerica, I really believe it should be here and not the original. And It's not often that I say this when it comes to placing originals on a \\"Greatest\\" album. I'm sure U.K. fans liked the original, but I am glad North America has it's own mix. I still do enjoy the version that is here, but I much prefer the remix. The other fault which isn't really is the missing \\"Break it Down Again\\" but since that song came a year after this album (1993) this album is not at fault. I know the VERY BEST makes up for these two but it still has that one major flaw that is inexcusable and is very indicative to greatest hits packages. Again, read that review for more info. <br />I'm not the die-hard, so I don't own all the albums. But this is a great album for anyone who likes strong and great music that has great hooks and melodies and strong lyrics, songs you will love for years after they are produced. Towards the end of the album there are a couple of filler songs, which is a bit of shame because before this, track for track this album was very consistent. They should have put \\"Suffer The Children\\" on here instead of on that other collection. Ah well. <br />And don't forget, TFF is supposed to be releasing a new album soon, Roland/Curt team is back. Pick up this album for an a great overview of this great band with the original songs intact. For the songs released after this collection, pick up the actual albums too. 10/12
B000005DQR|5.0|This album is one of the most beautiful pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I have been a full time musician, and as such have listened to a wide variety of good and not so good music, but this album is just...phenomenal. DJ Shadow has the mind of a musical genius. Also being a Massive Attack fan, I find the production side of it intriguing. It almost seems minimalistic; cutting and pasting, putting samples on top of beats and mixing, but the whole album comes together so perfectly! DJ Shadow is an inspirational musician. I find his music uplifting, and suitable for any situation. Changeling is probably my favourite track. DJ Shadow has the phattest beats ever! Just the drum tracks alone could be an album worthy of buying.<BR>I am the proud owner of many CDs, but Endtroducing and Private Press are almost all I listen to these days. Not much music I hear actually gets me dancing, but Changeling, The Number Song, and Mutual Slump make me get up and boogie. So much GROOVE! I can't say enough good things about this album or the artist. Can't categorise him either. He's called DJ Shadow, but he's not your average scratch-break DJ. Ambience I think, is his thing.<BR>If you don't own a DJ Shadow album, buy one today. You'll be a better person for it.<BR>Also, don't rip him off, buy his album, don't burn it.
B000002KMY|4.0|I know what they're going to say: \\"There's no way 'Mob Rules' is better than 'Heaven & Hell'\\".  Let me explain.<br />Simply put, \\"Mob Rules\\" is a harder, more edgy effort than \\"Heaven & Hell\\".  The album opens with a fast, churning rocker, \\"Turn up the Night\\".  We then move into a more \\"typical\\" Sabbath sound with the bluesy \\"Voodoo\\".  The third piece is one of the best on the album: \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\".  It's an epic worthy of a Black Sabbath Greatest Hits album.  It also shows Dio's voice as we'll never hear it again on any other effort - Soft, serene, soothing (only to be shattered by a strategically placed power chord to introduce the rest of the band).  E5150 is, well, dumb - and the low point of the album.  I'm not sure what Sabbath was toying with here, but I do know that \\"5150\\" is the American Police Code for the criminally insane.  The title track is the hardest song on the album, and another one of my faves.  Also a contribution to the soundtrack for 1981's \\"Heavy Metal: The Movie\\", \\"The Mob Rules\\" makes you want to really stand up and shout (no pun intended).  I call the next two songs, \\"Country Girl\\" & \\"Slipping Away\\", twin songs for obvious reasons.  Though many fans overlook these two, I really like the blues-metal, foot-stomping \\"Slipping Away\\".  It comes complete with guitar rests to show off Vinny Appice's drumming, & an echo effect on Dio's vocals for some added attitude.  This song also shows a glimpse of some chops from Geezer Butler & Tony Iommi.  I don't think the album ends well with the last two cuts, \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\" & \\"Over and Over\\".  These last two songs sound much like an afterthought, and as a result, they are rather forgettable.<br />The album cover is one of the best \\"traditional\\" heavy metal covers I've seen, whose hooded figures look like inner city dregs stalking thier next victim.  Martin Birch's production is clean and crisp, especially for the 1980's.<br />On the downside, E5150 is a waste of time & the last two cuts are weak.  I wish the CD had photos and lyrics...<br />After listening to this album, (I know this may be blasphemy to some) I think Dio-era Sabbath is better than the traditional line-up with Ozzy.  Either way, the album is a must have for any fans of the \\"Golden Age\\" of traditional heavy metal.me & the last two cuts are weak.  I wish the CD had photos and lyrics...<br />After listening to this album, (I know this may be blasphemy to some) I think Dio-era Sabbath is better than the traditional line-up with Ozzy.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|As in toxic WASTE! <br />I'll never fully comprehend what is so appealing about this girl. Her music is just so unbelieveably awful it makes you want to cry. Cry in shame about how horrible the music industry is today. People these days must think that just because someone is attractive that it must mean they can also sing aswell. WRONG! This girl couldnt carry a tune if Aretha Franklin gave it to her! Please, give me a break. Stop buying this junk just because she looks oh so \\"pretty\\" in trendy, shallow, magazines. Until then, we're stuck with these talentless popstars who sing about \\"manufactured\\" love.
0767818040|5.0|Heres the story. Once upon there was a man who had this movie in his living room. Then his step-son brought it to his step-brothers and brothers room and watched it. After he FINISHED he put it in his brothers cupboard and left it there. Then his step-brother and brother found it and wondered where it came from. Baffled they decided to go sneak out onto a shut down bridge and leave it in the middle of it. Not long after that a construction team was brought in and they tore down the bridge. Legend has it that a crazy middle aged construction worker found it there moments before the bridge was blown away. He gave his life running back onto the bridge in hopes of retrieving it. Unfortunally neither came out alive and he lies at the bottom of the river in the most unbelievable peace known to man.
B00005JM20|5.0|This was the funniest movie in 2003! I laughed so hard that I almost started to cry. I don't like vulgarity and sex in movies; this was a welcome relief and more than satisfied me. I have seen it 5 times since I first watched it.<br />Highly recommended!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|This film was fairly heavily panned by the critics when it opened in September 2003 and I feel undeservedly so, for it is a highly watchable, if uninventive piece of cinema.<br />Kate Beckinsale plays a Vampire whose job is to hunt and kill Lychens (Werewolves) the sworn enemy of her coven, and her kind. The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled. A little heavy on the Matrix style fight sequences, with the usual ammunition flying in all directions, it is however, more than a reworked vampire tale of good vs evil, or eveil vs evil (whichever you take) - with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre. Without giving too much away, the art direction is gothic but modern and the new Sfx meets old world macabre well, even if there aren't too many suprises along the way. A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled &quot;human touch&quot; portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles. Highly enjoyable romp, with some nice extra's on the DVD, and certainly worth a second look.
B00005AQE8|5.0|That's 105 stars.  Yeah, this is the greatest cd of all time, no matter what type of music.  This is the greatest mc of all time on his best ever cd.  There isn't a song on here that I wouldn't put among the greatest tracks of all time.  He has features from the Outlawz, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Redman, KCi &amp; JoJo, and others.  Like I said, all the tracks crack, but the top five are Ambitions Az A Ridah, 2 of Americaz Most Wanted, Picture Me Rollin, When We Ride, and Life Goes On.  If you don't have this, go get it, I don't care if it's 2 in the morning and you gotta break into Sam Goody to jack it.  GO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!
B00000K19E|3.0|Superbly made as this film is, I'm getting sick of people suggesting that it's original.<BR>It isn't.<BR>The idea of the Matrix itself appears to be stolen off &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The virtual-realty thingy on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was even CALLED the Matrix. <BR>And the idea that our whole percieved environment is actually run by machines isn't knew either.<BR>However, these ideas are used superbly in this film, and the scenario they are put in makes for a very thought-provoking action film.
B000127LW2|5.0|In late 1993, prior to the beginning of what would become Star Trek: The Next Generation's last season, Rick Berman was given a phone call from Paramount Studios to begin work on a new Star Trek television series.<BR>However, this series would be unlike any previous created version.  The studio had decided that this show would be the first creation for the United Paramount Network (later to become UPN or Paramount Network), as the show's tagline stated, it simply \\"was the show that launched a network\\".<BR>Early on, Berman decided that not only would he executive produce, but he would share that role with Jeri Taylor and Michael Piller who were primarily running The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine respectively, while Berman was creating Star Trek: Generations.  As the three met in secret meetings for months, they eventually decided on a rich cast of characters in a unique setting, Star Trek was truly going into the unknown, even moreso than in The Original Series, to the complete other end of the galaxy (wonder why we never encountered the question \\"What does God need with a Starship\\" on this show), and created a rich environment.<BR>The first season of this show was amazingly written, and it by far is the most pollished Star Trek debut to date.  Yes, this series is not your perfect modern drama, if you want that, go to the store and pick up Deep Space Nine.  yes this show does not have the big recognition that others want, if you want that, go to the store and pick up the original or TNG.  However, if you want an amazingly pollished, written, acted show with characters that had an unbelieveable chemistry right from the beginning, (unlike Deep Space Nine which in time did become the best acted series) and with this season specifically, will show to you contemporary issues, but not preach or put blame upon you, then I wholeheardedly recommend Star Trek: Voyager's first season.  Pick up the first, second,third, fourth, and seventh for sure as they come out, and ifyou find you like them you may want five and six, five especially was amazingly written at times, but has several obvious flounders of the writing staff trying to figure out what to do.  As for the first season, you won't be dissapointed.
B00005JJX8|5.0|If you have not seen the film yet, I am very surprised about other reviews that claim there was no chemistry between Grant and Kelly --- there seemed to be a playfulness between them, very obvious when she first kisses him with a sultry look leaving him with a silly grin.  <br />The story, as a classic Hitchcock, is tightly knit (and as such you need to keep your eye on the story or you may get lost).<br />This one of our Hitchcock favorites.
0876852630|5.0|Factotum is a good Bukowski novel. I think Ham on Rye, Post Office, and Women are his better novels, but Factotum has its own somber character, and it fills in an autobiographical gap between his school days and his time at the post office. It carries over a lot of the themes and the lifestyle pictured in Down and Out in Paris and London by Orwell.
B00005JME0|2.0|In a room full of excited college students, the film began. An awesome screenshot, proudly displaying a quote from the chaos theory graces the screen as a small blue butterlfy appears and flies away. Kutcher appears, panting, disheveled. Dimly lighted with a tint of royal, the scene takes off in a fury with the beginnings of the wonderful soundtrack that the film proudly displays. <br />But it is downhill from there...<br />And don't be fooled - the trailer is decieving. <br />While I still maintain that the music saved the film (trust me, it was AMAZING), I almost felt like leaving. Not only were some of the most serious parts of the film laughable (and trust me, the room was laughing), but some parts were just darn lame. The dialogue was badly written, even if the script itself had potential. And that is the story of this film, uncarried out potential. The Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect (within the Chaos theory), which both state the if you change one thing, it changes everything, are both ambiguous and hardly discussable topics. It is no wonder that the film leaves the viewer with a yearning for something more. <br />I have a severe problem with a previous reviewer's comparison to Memento and the Sixth Sense. If you have seen and liked Memento (one of the best films ever made, in my opinion), you will probably find the idea of The Butterfly Effect to be, at least, interesting. BUT, the two films are not even comparable. The Sixth Sense is also one of my favorite films. However, both Memento and The Sixth Sense have resolute, yet wonderfully ambiguous endings that will make you cringe and smile at the same time. The Butterfly Effect fails at this in all respects. It gets to the point where the viewer wonders how any ending could possibly save this movie. And the ending is as blase as one would think.<br />Now, I'm not saying that the film was horrible - it was just bad. The acting is mediocre (despite a few horrendous miscasts, including Kutcher's character's mother), and the characters that you feel the closest to are not even main characters. While I almost cried for Kailey's (Amy Smart) brother, I did not once feel compassion for Ashton Kutcher. <br />But the idea was so wonderful! <br />If you are intrigued by the premise, give this film a shot. Maybe it has something going for that I am just completely missing. However, don't expect too much. It's nothing more than a step in the right direction for Ashton Kutcher and nothing less than a somewhat intriguing B movie. Just have fun and take it for what it is.
B00003W8NM|5.0|What can I say about this movie that has'nt already been said? It's beautifuly directed, spectacularly acted and wonderfuly quotable. So any one who downs this movie just is'nt thinking straight or they dont get it (and they do have that excuse), but it does need exmination if your mind is boggled. Perhaps one of the best parts about this film is that it keeps you thinking three days after you've seen it, and that's the idea. Before viewing this picture prepare to be blown away with dark humor, some blood, a little bit of grossness, and of course, Tyler Durden.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Amazing debut album. This one lives up to the hype. One of my favorite albums of the past 3 years.
6305212112|5.0|On DVD that is. When I heard this movie was coming out on DVD, I was more than overwhelmed. I had so badly been wanting to own this movie, and now I do. Don't think once about buying this movie, it'll keep you wanting to watch again and again. It gives you a sense of comedy and drama without ever dropping either category.<br />Evelyn Couch (The always wonderful Kathy Bates) has a pretty routine life. Go to marriage counseling, make her husbands dinner, and go to bed. That is until she meets Ninny (Jessica Tandy) an elderly lady living in a rest home near her house. Evelyns curiosity is growing as Ninny tells a story about two women she knew in time. The story is about stubborn Idgie (Mary Stuart-Masterson) who has stayed away from home ever since her older brothers death. Her and Ruth (Mary Louise-Parker) a family friend come to visit for the summer start to hit it off, and son become the best of friends. While Idgie the bee charmer collects honey, Ruth gets out more and learns to have fun. As the two become even closer, they decided, why not start a business? In the sleepy town of Whistle Stop, Ruth and Idgies cafe shall add a little spice to the town, and even attract some out of town visitors. Whether welcome, or unwelcome, the customers will play a big role in the story. Through everything, abusive husbands, Ku Klux Klansman, Trains, and deaths, the two will stay close friends. Evelyn is soon also giving herself more self respect, and is coming back more and more to hear Niny's story, even becoming part of the story herself. Ninny and Evelyn soon become close friends too, and learn the valuable lesson to like things while they last.<br />Impeccable. Everything about this movie is flawless. With the directors commentary on the DVD, you find out new information about the film that interesting, and funny. You even get Sipseys recipes from the Whistle Stop Cafe itself. 5 stars for a movie to be cherished forever.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead never cease to amaze me. With every album, something new comes into they're music. Go and buy this album. My Pick for best of 2003.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I have to agree with every one of you. My thought is this ... these are songs that were all written at the same time as those featured on Surfacing ... but they didn't fit, manager didn't want to make a double CD, whatever. Ergo, new album, &quot;...let's wait six years and hope no one notices. At the very least, all our die-hard fans will buy it and we'll have enough money for our next project.&quot;
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|This album can be summed up in the title I have given it. It has the exact same sound as the Strokes debut album, Is This It, but still amazes. The guitar work on Room On Fire, is much more sophisticated, as it is catchy. The clever little riffs included in each song are a delight to the ears. The Lyrics, are where Julian shows a true progression. My favorite is I can't win.
B000002VMH|5.0|When my Dad died in 2000, I stopped at Gravelly Point along the Potomac River where the planes take off, on my way back from a job. I popped \\"Diva\\" into the CD player and bawled my head off.<br />For a \\"tuff\\" old dude like me who cries maybe once a decade, this album gave me access to emotional release that I really needed at the time.<br />I really don't know any other album that gives me straight and true emotion like this one. The album, for me is singular and unique, and is a great contribution, not just to music, but to compassionate and intelligent human expression in general.
B00005JN02|5.0|Excellent review and inside to how it was living in East Germany, I grew up there and find the film very realistic. Excellent film und fun to watch!
0385504209|1.0|The DaVinci Code has a compelling premise but an uninspired delivery.  I wonder why fans of this book don't realize how poorly written it is.<br />Dan Brown has the same problem as his counterparts on the opposite side of the religious spectrum who write the Left Behind series -- lazy writing.  Brown's characters have nothing memorable to offer.  The villains are simply implausible, (a common enough problem in many current thrillers) and the violence is graphic and contrived.  There are too many overtly clever riddles, the time line is ridiculous and Brown's descriptions lack impact of any kind.<br />I do admit that I found Brown's biblical arguments interesting, which is really the only reason to read this book.
B00002SWEM|5.0|If you have never been to Cuba, this is a mildly amusing documentary about a chapter in the history of carribean music. If, however,  you have walked through the neigborhood of Buena Vista on 70th Street in La Habana or watched the sun go down from the Malec&oacute;n at the mouth of the Rio Almendares this film will make your mouth go dry and your eyes water. Vim Wenders and Ry Cooder, quite by accident discovered a cache of musicians who had played in  the forties in a Cabaret called the Buena Vista Social Club that is now long gone. They have common characteristics, they are old, they were forgotten and they were and are incredibly gifted. Some have now died in their eighties and nineties. They were rescued and recorded in the nick of time. The film is apolitical and was shot digitally without apology. The CD from the sound track sold gozillions of copies and raised the export of Cuban music and musicians to be a world treasure. The type of music is called &quot;son&quot; and arose from the Danzon (the big dance) of the early part of the century. Played by three to six musician with uncomplicated instruments, you get to meet each of them individually. Collectively, son is &quot;guajiro&quot; or country boy music. The stars, including Compay Segundo, Eliades Ochoa and the charming Ibrahim Ferrar will become perpetually embedded in your memory. Until this country comes to its senses you will be deprived of the experience of this touching world, but until then you can enjoy it vicariously at the Buena Vista Social Club.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been listening to DT since IAW, and I've always considered &quot;Awake&quot; to be the pinnacle of their progressiveness.  Their career to me has always had parallels with Rush's.  To whit:<br />When Dream and Day Unite - Rush<BR>The same kind of collection of songs, both by bands that hadn't really found a critical member (in the case of Rush, Neil Peart, in the case of DT, James Labrie)<br />Images and Words - Fly By Night<BR>You can easily see the similarities in two bands trying to &quot;out-prog&quot; themselves on both &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; and &quot;Learning To Live&quot;<br />Awake - Caress of Steel<BR>You can REALLY hear shades of &quot;Didacts and Narpets&quot; in the drum solo that opens &quot;6:00&quot;.<br />A Change of Seasons - 2112<BR>Same idea:  First you get the concept album side, then the filler.  <br />Falling Into Infinity - A Farewell to Kings<BR>Both bands stretching themselves a little too far, but in each case you get a real beautiful ballad:  &quot;Anna Lee&quot; and &quot;Closer To the Heart&quot;<br />Scenes From a Memory - Hemispheres<BR>The parallel again is perfect, here.  SFAM continues a theme from an earlier song, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, quoting heavily from it, and building it into a concept.  &quot;Hemispheres&quot; continues the theme from &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; and quotes heavily from it, building it into a concept.<br />6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence - Permanent Waves<BR>&quot;Natural Science,&quot; compares well to any of the prog-pieces of 6DOIT.  Although it's more as if Rush had made an album's worth of &quot;Natural Science&quot; type pieces.<br />Which brings us to <br />Train of Thought - Moving Pictures<BR>Moving Pictures is highly thought of as Rush's big &quot;Metal&quot; album.  And yet, here is where the big move to keyboards for them began.  But still, probably their heaviest album at that point.  And it also alienated a whole lot of their long-time fans because of it, and because it wasn't &quot;progressive&quot; enough.  But even then, it also brought in new fans who would never have listened to Rush before then.  It's quite amazing when you think about it; it was the absolute PEAK of Rush. And in the same sense, I think this will 20 years later (as we are now 20 years+ removed from Moving Pictures) be considered the PEAK of DT.  This is their best album, to my ears, since &quot;Awake.&quot;  &quot;In the Name of God&quot; is destined to be a piece they will still play in 2024, one of those songs that becomes synonymous with it's album like &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; is with &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;.<br />I guess the saddest thing is, we have yet to see DT's &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; or &quot;Test For Echo.&quot;  Enjoy this album while you can.  Chances are, if history serves, it's going to be the last good one from DT.<br />But oh, WHAT A F***ing great album it is.
0792106989|4.0|This is about as close as you can get to a perfect film, with one serious exception: James Stewart and John Wayne were twenty years too old for their parts.  This can only be attributed to director John Ford, whose introversion made it harder and harder for him to deal with new actors and technicians as he got older.  That aside, it's a riveting Western meditation about the nature of law and order and the uses of force to establish civilization.
6303407188|5.0|THE PEOPLE THAT DONT LIKE THIS MOVIE, ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT THINK \\" NAVY SEALS \\"  IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.. IF YOU ARE COMMON, THEN ED WOOD ISNT FOR YOU. ED WOOD IS A MOVIE FOR PEOPLE WHO VIEW MOVIES WITH THEIR MINDS, NOT THEIR EYES ( IF YOU ARE THAT KIND OF PERSON, THEN THE FILMING IN B&W SHOULD OF ADDED TO THE EXPERIENCE ). ED WOOD  IS PURE ART AND TIM BURTON IS AN INCREDIBLE ARTIST. HE TOOK HIS PASSION, WENT AGAINST ALL ODDS AND MADE THIS MASTERPIECE OF A MOVIE. THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS MOVIE, I COULDNT BELIEVE HOW MUCH I ENJOYED IT . I HAVE TO SAY TO MARTIN LANDAU ( IF YOU ARE LISTENING ), THAT YOU DESERVED EVERY INCH OF THAT OSCAR.. YOU WERE BRILLANT AS BELA LAGOUSI. THE FUNNIEST LINE IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN ED SAYS TO BELA IN THE CAR, \\" BUT YOURE A BIG STAR \\" AND BELA ANSWERS BACK, THAT WAS THE OLD DAYS, NOW NO ONE GIVES TWO [cents] FOR BELA.  PLEASE, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
B000002KCI|4.0|I truly loved Zuma back in 1974 when it was released, and I've continued to play it regularly since that time. For the true fan of Neil and the Horse it's an absolute classic, with the right mix of extended guitar jams like \\"Danger Bird\\" \\"Drive Back\\" and  the classic \\"Cortez the Killer\\" showing how Neil and the Boys could rock with the best of them!  The latter two are practically standards of any Neil Yougn & Crazy Horse concert I've seen.   \\"Barstool Blues\\" is a truly inspired song,too. with a bluesy sound. As well, the more laid back songs like \\"Pardon My Heart\\" and \\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" have that essential Neil and Crazy Horse spark.  Many of the songs reflect the personal pain of Neil's breaking up with his lover, Carrie Snodgress (the actress of \\"I fell in love with the actress\\" fame from Harvest's \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\"( This is especially true lyrically of \\"Pardon My Heart\\", \\"Danger Bird\\" and \\"Stupid Girl\\" and even the lovely personal \\"I know she's out there somewhere and she loves me to this day\\" ending of one of his all time  great songs, \\"Cortez the Killer\\". It's true also of his \\"friend's\\" lost love in \\"Barstool Blues\\". The album also has it's light folky songs, the optimistic \\"Looking for a Love\\" (after Carrie) and the Crosby-Stills-Nash and Young out-take \\"Through my Sails\\".  To sum up, one of the best Neil Young and Crazy Horse albums, which has stood the test of time for over a quarter of a century. A must buy for anyone who considers themselves a true \\"Rustie'!!
B00005JLK1|2.0|I was conflicted with how to rate this film. After letting it sink in after viewing it, I knew it was a pretty lousy film and was probably a one star film. But I do enjoy a ghost story, even if it's one that is typical, predictable, and filled with as many cliches as one could imagine being in one film, which pretty much sums up this film. But, because of the creep factor that the film possesses, the great looking ship itself, and the decrepid abyss that eats up the crew inside, I found myself enjoying the look and atmosphere. I always enjoy that kind of stuff. It made for a completely un-surprising film, but there were enough good looking scenes and moments of ghostly activity and kills that made it the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. The film opens with a rather bloody mess. A scene that, while looking incredibly fake and computer generated, was still pretty cool and gruesome. This bloody scene takes place on the italian cruise ship, the Antonia Graza. Skip ahead 40 years and we meet a rag tag salvage crew, captained by Gabriel Byrne. Why was he in this?. Certainly his distinguished career is above doing this movie?. &quot;ER&quot; alumnus Juliana Margulies is also part of the crew, as is Ron Eldard, who is Margulies' real life squeeze. They get an offer from a stranger, played by Desmond Harrington, who has stumbled upon the ghostly wreckage of the Antonia Graza. He convinces the crew to go and salvage the ship. Once they get there, it is obvious from the get go that the place hasn't lost any of it's passengers. Even though the ship has been there, in the Bering Sea, for 40 years. There is nothing new that comes thereafter. Typical hauntings here and there, some rather cool looking and fun, but in the end, expected. The effects are rather underwhelming as well. Nothing special, nothing new. It's one big cliche after another, but darnit, the ciches were okay to look at!. The acting is better than you would normally get in a cheap, cheesy flick like this. Mainly because, for some reason, they actually got name people, and real actors to fill their cast. Juliana does the Sigourney thing and she more or less gets the job done. Byrne, like I said, has had a nice and respectful career, and he does fine with what he has. But why did he agree to do it?!. All the others are adequate as well. This movie is pure camp all the way, but the look of the movie is fun, and there is always something kind of endearing about little pieces of thriller fluff like this.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Your reaction to this cinematically lovely film will rely on your frame of mind when you sit down to watch it.  You can either be swept up in the lush sentimentality, or you will roll your eyes at the schmaltz-appeal.  Either way, it is an impressive adaptation of the popular bestseller and successfully recreates the look of the early 20th Century with exacting detail (The Wardrobe Designer is to be especially lauded, although whoever was in charge of hair made some curious choices with wigs and pieces).  Tobey McGuire is typically excellent (he is also an Executive Producer)as is Chris Carter.  Jeff Bridges is charming as ever, but somehow doesn't manage to convey the chemistry with his male costars that the moviemakers and press representatives relentlessly touted.  Elizabeth Banks, looking lovely, has virtually nothing to do and is relegated to a lot of &quot;Go Biscuit!&quot; cheers, but in the filmmakers' defense--there probably wasn't much else for the ladies to do. William H. Macy is appropriately over the top in his campy cameo, making you realize that only in big-budget studio productions could you have someone of his celebrity play such a small role.<br />As for the DVD, the bonus materials are noteworthy.  Producer/Screenwriter/Director Gary Ross is an interesting and articulate guy with an obvious passion for his subject matter.<br />Why PG-13?  In my opinion, PG would have sufficed...
B000000WA4|5.0|Like I Said...Otherworldly.  That alone is enough for me to be satisfied with this album.  Now go buy it, and see what I mean.
B0000A9GLS|2.0|This is really a mess.  One wonders how such movies get made.  James Mangold, who was off to such fine start in his directorial career with the critically acclaimed Heavy (1995) and the superior psychodrama Girl, Interrupted (1999), and even the slightly offbeat but intriguing Cop Land (1997), really loses it here with this bizarro attempt at something like Psycho and David and Lisa meet Agatha Christie's \\"Ten Little Indians.\\"<br />The premise is ridiculous and the resolution just plain silly.  Without revealing anything (the denouement of the obtuse plot being perhaps the only thing that might keep the thumb of most intelligent viewers over the age of, say, fourteen, off the stop button) let me say that when it's over you just might feel cheated.<br />John Cusack stars as an ex-cop, now a chauffeur, who can suture wounds.  The scene is the Nevada/California desert during a savage downpour that traps ten (+1) people at an isolated motel where bloody mayhem of the most inexplicable sort ensues as one by one the guests turn up dead.  The action consists of wet people screaming and staring with horror at such sights as a dead man with a baseball bat shoved three-quarters of the way down his throat, etc.  They insult each other a lot.  Prostitutes don't like cops; little guys who never got any, hate prostitutes, and the little boy doesn't really love his mommy, etc.  As the coincidences pile up (as the motel proprietor remarked, with the odds against being \\"trillions to one\\") we begin to realize that either something supernatural is going on or...  You guessed it.  It's all a....<br />But I can't say.  We do get a hint of how everything will turn out when Mangold flash-forwards to a group of shrinks and other interested parties who are holding a kind of seance around what seems to be John Cusack's character.<br />Anyway, even the acting is not that good with the usually very fine Cusack seemingly infected by the deficiencies of the other players, or the stupidities of the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold.  (I don't think the actors wanted too many takes in all that water, and it shows.)  At any rate if you want to see a little kid and some mediocre actors overact or a lot of people deadpan the horror their eyes spy while barking at each other or you just like seeing Hollywood players have to make a living while wet, go for it.  Otherwise, hit the off button and watch reruns of \\"That 70's Show.\\"the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold.

B000002IJA|5.0|So far AC/DC has never put out a \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Best of...\\"album, unless you count \\"AC/DC Live\\" As the title says \\"Who Made Who\\" is a good, albeit quick, overview of AC/DC. There are two songs from \\"Back in Black\\", two from \\"Fly on the Wall\\", one from \\"For Those About to Rock (We sulute You)\\", one from \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" and three new songs (Chase the Ace, title track, and DT) It is good place to start if you are not that familiar with AC/DC. But there are a number of AC/DC essentials that are ommitted. There is only one song from the Bon Scott era. And don't forget that this album came out in the mid 80s and misses out on some of the of their more resent material.
0553381407|5.0|Finally, someone who understands that there are other types of abuse besides physical and sexual -- and that they are just as damaging!<br />The first part of the book explores ways that parents can abuse their children.  I found it helpful, because hearing examples and reading stories gives the reader a clear understanding of the difference between occasional parental mistakes and flat-out abuse/neglect.  It also prevents the reader from descending into denial.  One word of warning however: while not graphic, many of the stories are detailed enough to trigger.  If this is an issue, I *strongly* recommend checking with a therapist before reading the book.<br />The second part of the book talks about practical ways to reverse one's emotional enmeshment with toxic parents.  Dr. Forward recommends formal therapy in all cases, and states unequivocally that it is absolutely essential in certain situations.  Readers should pay attention to this advice!  Many of the solutions are not going to be pleasant.<br />The most refreshing solution included the blunt statement that forgiveness is not necessary.  This is not to say that one should not let go of the past.  Dr. Forward is saying that the traditional idea of \\"forgiveness\\" involves treating the situation as if it were minor and easily corrected.  This devalidates the trauma.  A story included in this section points out that this is not contrary to the Christian ideal of forgiveness -- God wants the abused to get better, too.<br />Dr. Forward also leads the reader through a series of exercises that helps the reader internalize the idea that while the abuse was not their fault, their response is completely a matter of their own control.  The exercises are practical and useful.<br />My only complaint about this book is that there is no information, and only one brief mention, concerning situations of no contact between parents and abused children (when the parent relationship is still an issue, as it is in some).  The book would be improved if that were included.<br />This book would be extraordinarily helpful at some point for everyone going through therapy to deal with childhood traumas.  It might not be right early in the therapy program, but there will come a time when it is.would be improved if that were included.<br />This book would be extraordinarily helpful at some point for everyone going through therapy to deal with childhood traumas.

B00005JMTQ|5.0|As a 'mature aged' person I related heavily on many different levels to 'Something's Gotta Give'. Jack Nicholson, as much as he is older, overweight and wearing increased wrinkles..this is life, it happens to all of us.  Diane Keaton is the same (but not overweight). 'Unfortunate' camera angles that were deliberate were ingenious, thoughtful and provided the honest picture of 'mature aged' persons in all our glory.  This film is life, life as I have experienced, life as many of us have experienced.  'Something's Gotta Give' stimulates self-reflection.  I went home stimulated and reflective with many long forgotten personal life episodes coming to mind (and will continue coming to mind).  I am remembering things in my past, considering my future and reflecting on the road I have trod and the road I am following.  Paris for my and my partners birthday next year perhaps? Throughout the film the sound track is brilliant and it was so pleasing to enjoy the same music I listen to at home instead of roaring and aurally abusing music that is predominant in so many other films.  A 'Must See' Movie.  Well Done!
B00003CXDD|5.0|Anyone with real knowledge about good films knows that Willow is a classic. To compare it to films like Lord of the Rings is unfair because Willow was made years ago DUH!( before special effects took over Hollywood). &quot; Lord of the Rings &quot; may be a good film but Willow has a generation of fans and is one film that lasts a lifetime. Come five years from now when all the hype about &quot; Lord &quot; is gone will we ever hear about it again? Maybe, maybe not. &quot; Lord of the Rings &quot; wouldn't be anything without loads of costly special effects. Willow beats the film in acting hands down. Willow has already been around almost twenty years so that should say something for its worth. True fans of good films and exciting fantasy tales should enjoy this movie. Willow lives on in the hearts of many grown ups who were once children during the time of this film. I suggest everyone see this movie at least once. And if you already love it such as many do, enjoy this super DVD and ignore unfair comparisons to other films. Willow was a great film for its time and still is. At least take the advice of someone who can spell before making your final decision.  This movie rocks!
B000088E6D|5.0|The next superstar of the 21st century. Great CD, and I mean every track.  Looking forward to hearing some original songs of his own.  Great talent.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As if the first two weren't good enough... Howard Shore had to go and create an even BETTER score.  If you like music period, then you must buy this score.  There's not a dull moment.  From the creepy Shelob's Lair to the beautiful Into the West, this is a must-have CD.  I strongly recommend it to anyone.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Ann Blyth who plays Veda, in this movie based losely on the novel, steals the show with an outstanding performance and makes the movie work.  I don't think the dynamics between her character and Joan Crawford (who plays her mother Mildred Pierce) would have worked as well with a different actress!<br />The sparks and tension portrayed in such a sublime fashion are what made this a great movie!
B00000JMQE|5.0|I love this movie. It is more in the spirit of L.Frank Baums books and sticks to the book so closley. The characters such as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, the Lion, Tik Tok, Jack, and Gump look more like they should from the covers of the original books(not people in make-up and colorful clothes). If you are thinking of getting this and have silly ideas of it being like the classic musical DON'T! It's much different, but in my mind better. Tik Tok is my favorite character and he looks and sounds so cool. Hope this helps anyone interested in this movie. Being from Kansas i should know right? -LOL
B00005JMCN|4.0|There is a lot of unreedeming, worthless trash coming out of Hollywood these days. With that in mind, I recommend Seabiscuit as an antidote to said trash. Nowadays, anything with heart and a good message that doesn't shock, offend, or annoy should be encouraged, even though the negative comments about this film are mostly valid. Yes, it is confusing at the start as you wind up awash in characters, but it all settles down and gives you something to cheer about, which is what Seabiscuit evidently did for the Americans in the Depression. Yes, it is refrigerator magnet-like in its earnestness. Dont let that stop you from renting or buying this mostly wholesome, uplifting movie.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Rather then repeating everything previous reviewers have said on here, I will just say one thing:  Believe the reviews you read on here and not the critics reviews.  For some reason this movie got knocked by critics big time.  The only way I would compare it to the Matrix sequels is to say it's a much better movie then either of them were.  This is a great, original movie.  It's a sci-fi movie with some plot and substance which is something a lot of new sci-fi movies are lacking.
B00000JGHM|5.0|It is very sad how some people still just can't get it.  This film explores the true definitions of honor and respect, and what do some people say about it?  &quot;uh.... it should have been more like dirty harry... uh uh...&quot;  Oh, how profound an individual you are my friend.<br />It is intellects like these that leave the world in pieces, never to fix or change anything that is wrong. I guarantee you these are the same people who think &quot;The Fast and The Furious&quot; is an award worthy film, watch &quot;reality&quot; tv shows (i.e. Average Joe), and vote the new Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears songs onto the Billboard top ten.<br />Bottom line, &quot;Heat&quot; is an epic.  Pacino and De Niro are epic.  The film is about character.  It is about true REALITY, what the world is really like out there.  Life isn't a big bowl of cherries 24/7 like our culture tries to depict (especially to our youth) today.  We all don't have the golden life, we all don't have our rich mommies and daddies to live off of.<br />There bad things out there, and people who have to deal with them to protect all the happy shiny people. The decisions these people make are based on them having the qualities that are portrayed in this film.  The &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; buffs need to crawl back under their rock because its a bunch of B/S.  Doesn't work that way holmes. In the real world these &quot;tough&quot; guys get the long kiss goodnight. You do what is honorable without letting love or friendship stand in your way. That is what makes the difference.<br />After having said all of that, I will conclude with saying this is a must see but only for mature individuals who have depth of perception and the ability to think outside of what has become the box.  If you think &quot;The Fast and The Furious&quot; is academy award worthy material, &quot;reality&quot; tv shows are classic, and vote for teeny music on the billboard... stay away from this.  Stick with what you can handle, this will only overwhelm you.ll only overwhelm you.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I really enjoy this CD.  It is meant to be played LOUD!  It is like his work with his former group(Soundgarden), which I liked alot, and not much like the Rage Against the Machine songs that I had heard, which I didn't like.
B000099T2L|5.0|OK, so what if some people are saying that this album is not pop but that it is R&amp;B.  PUHLEASE!  Pop is just R&amp;B with a little extra bubble gum and blond hair! Beyonce has a very, very soulful voice so of course it won't sound like Britney or Jessica.  This is a very good album and yes there are alot of ballads, but that's because she has the pipes to pull it off.  Take it from some one who is a die hard pop and R&amp;B fan....Buy this CD!
B000089RVX|4.0|I like this album but it's not cheerful stuff.  Kind of makes me want to put on alot of black eyeliner. The songs are not overtly depressing, though!! If you have heard any of their songs on the radio or seen videos on MTV/VH1, then you should know what to expect on this CD, and you won't be disappointed.
B00004R99J|4.0|This is a beautiful film, the music is good and well recorded, I have the LaserDisc, and will wait for the special edition on DVD, the LD is stunning and the next edition on DVD should be as well, Disney Movies, be they based on Fairy Tales, Myth/Ledgend, History, or Music (Fantasia) are all imaginative expanded versions of the original story, and meant to entertain, not to be held up as examples of the original book, however don't you think that a parent could use any of these films to get the younger ones to read the original storys?, have discussions about the differences, and if they matter in the long run?, and when it comes to Fairy Tales which version is better, and why?.
0517548232|4.0|Of the positive reveiews, they seem to be amazed that someone can define economics.  It's not really rocket science, and, in an age of plenty, it's not really about scarcity.  It's about individuals making choices to maximize value.  They may be bad choices, uniformed choices or perverse choices, but they have, in the final analysis, impact limited to the individual.  And in most cases result in some level of increased individual satisfaction.<BR>The real danger, according to Hazlitt, is when the choices of a few people, with same kinds of fallacies noted above, are coercive, enforced by government or monopolies.  Which leads us to to the negative reviews.<BR>The negatives, if we can be allowed to throw out the obvious loser rants, seem to be concerned mainly with rapacious corporations, free trade among inequal countries and natural monopolies.  While these are certainly provide distortions of individual choice and informed consent, they do in the long run tend to be self correcting -- see government-sanctioned coal and oil monopolies.  The real interest is in how to minimize the effects of these diseconomies.<BR>Hazlitt would argue that they are self-correcting via the collective effect of individual choices.  The Marxists would argue that action based upon the sceeding of individual choice to a collective power is the solution.  Surely, if we can assume there is no absolute, theoretical winner in this debate, we can look to the real world, based upon the actions of multiple forms of government and millions of individuals to provide some guidance on which path leads to the most for the most.<BR>To that end, I would challenge you to read Hazlitt's book and a Marxist equivalent like Ivan Ilich's &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and then, accepting both as plausibly complete and material, match them against your experience of recent history and your hopes for your personal future.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember... Obviously the title of this book tells us what is going to happen after we have read this book. A Walk to Remember did not only capture our hearts but it's also a book you won't soon forget. <BR>  This book written by Nicholas Sparks had reveled true love that had change the main character Landon Carter's life. Landon Carter was simply nothing at first. He had nothing good to write on his University application. So he had to run for the student body president. After than his life starts to change. Then he was in the school play which also made him see more things in a different way. Finally what had change his point of view most was Jamie Sullivan, the girl who he least want to fall in love with. <BR>  Jamie Sullivan was like an angel who always sees life beautiful. She had showed Landon how happiness and pain of life is. People always see her weird, including Landon (at first) but finally Landon see the inner Jamie and finally fall in love with her. <BR>  Landon after fell in love with Jamie had decided to scarify himself to her but then he found out she was dieing. He had done everything to keep his best memories with her. After they had married, eventhough she was gone. To him she will always be there till the last day of his life.<BR>  This book had touched me in everyway. This book had made me cry again and again. Nicholas Sparks have the skills to build your emotions to climax then your tears will run through you face. I'm inspired by this book. Then i look back to my own life. Infact along the path that i had walked i have met good and bad people. They are the ones who teach me the good and bad of life. <BR>  The movie is not 100 percent like the book which is good because it gives you passion to want to read how the book is as well. Even though the movie did not make you cry again and again it sure does make you cry and want to watch again.
B00008K78M|5.0|Laura's voice is beautiful.  I don't understand italian but even though her voice can be appreciated.  The concert is well performed, with excellent musicians, backup singers and good takes.  I'm a big fan of Laura and this concert is a must-have to all her fans.
B00005JM02|5.0|We loved it.  My 19 month old was mesmerized for most of the movie as was I and my wife.<br />Awesome visuals, a very good story and ... just great on a Widescreen.  I'd recommend this enthusiastically.
B00000JCOV|3.0|Well, this is definatly an acquired taste. If you are not a fan of extremely heavy metal, stay away from the CD. Slipknot kicks off their first large album with a quick, repetative, computer-generated voice saying &quot;The whole thing I think is (sic).&quot; Then they jump immeadiatly into the song (Sic) which sets up the rest of the album: Heavy, in your face, fast paced, and dark... very dark. The song &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; is their best, and oddly enough one of the calmest they've done. I didn't like &quot;Spit it Out&quot; very much, it's more rap than anything else. The second half of the album is much better, more energetic and fast paced. I wouldn't reccomend the CD for anyone who thinks Korn is hard rock.
6305696071|4.0|Everyone knows this story, whether they've experienced certain parts of it, or just love it pure &amp; simply because it's terrific. And if you haven't seen it, why not?! Go out and get it now. Go on!<br />This is the one Julia Roberts film that can never be out-done. No amount of Erin Brockovich's can beat this movie. This catapulted Julia into the big-time, mainstream movies, and she's now one of the highest paid actresses. I dunno whether something like Pretty Woman was never done before this, or whether I'm just sick of Julia Roberts now, but she won't come across a script as good as this again. Not even the supposed &quot;sequel&quot;, with Richard Gere &amp; Julia reteaming (they could go all the way and do a Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks) with Garry Marshall and Hector Elizondo for Runaway Bride. Nowhere near as good. But that's a different movie.<br />The actors are great, and I think it's the only Richard Gere movie I've ever seen - apart from Runaway Bride. The night elevator operator's face (Patrick Richwood) is an absolute picture most of the time, and he makes you laugh just by looking at him.<br />Of course, everyone knows that Julia's character, Vivian, turns from a poor hooker, into a rich lady. I much prefer Vivian as the hooker. When you first meets Edward (Richard Gere), she's fine, she's cute, and he gives her all this money, and she turns into a frumpy, awkward lady. The clothes are ill-fitting and really don't suit her.<br />In a few years, when Julia Roberts is old and grey (Richard Gere already was old &amp; grey in this!), this will be considered a classic.<br />Watch out for a very much blink and you'll miss him role of the detective, played by Hank Azaria. I've seen this movie a hundred times, and it's the first time I noticed him!<br />The songs are terrific in this, from Roy Orbison's &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; to Natalie Cole's &quot;Wild Women Do&quot; (the video is not impressive though). The best song is of course, Roxette's &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, played as Vivian leaves Edward. It's a very poignant scene, and I always play this song if I'm feeling down about something. The lyrics match any relationship problem perfectly, and matches the scene in Pretty Woman.Been Love&quot;, played as Vivian leaves Edward. It's a very poignant scene, and I always play this song if I'm feeling down about something. The lyrics match any relationship problem perfectly, and matches the scene in Pretty Woman.

B0000DZ3EA|5.0|The cover photo inside of Peter Gabriel holding his balding head as if he is perplexed perfectly captures my feelings about this career retrospective. Peter Gabriel changes musical styles almost as often as most folks change their socks; he absorbs whatever musical area has lately caught his fancy and incorporates it into his own unique songwriting. Hit provides a superior overview of his career to date and includes a number of tracks not collected on a PG disc before. But Hit isn't definitive by any stretch of the imagination; it focuses on--surprise--his hit singles and key album tracks from most of his albums starting with Peter Gabriel 3 (aka Melt). While that was the album that helped him breakthrough to a new audience, it wasn't the start of his solo career and, as such, this collection gives short shift to two key recordings that helped set the stage for more musical invention.<br />The new track (which was originally intended for \\"Up\\" but dropped at the last minute)is a terrific slice of classic PG. Co-written with Karl Wallinger from World Party, it's superior to much of the material that ended up on the last album. The first CD closes with the acoustic re-recording of Here Comes the Flood which debuted on 16 Golden Greats. No unusual choices here and much of Hit is found on Shaking The Tree. The remastering sounds great. There's absolutely nothing from Gabriel's second solo album which is a pity.<br />The second disc Miss focuses more on the album tracks (many of which received radio airplay but weren't released as singles).  The real gems here for long time fans are the tunes Downside Up and Lovetown. Downside Up is a live recording of the song from OVO and Lovetown originally appeared on the soundtrack to Philadelphia. There's also a taste from his soundtrack Rabbit-Proof Fence (Cloudless) as well. Many of these tracks, though also appeared on 16 Golden Greats. It should also be noted that some of the tracks here are edited versions.<br />What's missing are--for me--two of the best tracks on 16 Golden Greats. The remix of I Have The Touch (originally a B-Side for a single)and Shaking the Tree. With so much overlap, I'm really surprised that Gabriel didn't throw in more surprises. His last 4 albums are pretty well represented here. The Tower That Ate People and Father, Son are two fairly strong tracks from Gabriel's Ovo CD (which never got an offical US release).<br /> Hit is a pretty comprehensive collection even if Gabriel chose to skip Peter Gabriel 2 (aka Scratch)entirely when compiling this set. As to why his second album is missing--it's pretty well known that he felt the sessions were rushed and he wasn't happy with the finished product compared to his first and third albums.<br />I'd recommend Hit for fans who wish to have the soundtrack contribution included here and the live recording of Downside Up as well as Burn You Up, Burn You Down. These 3 tracks along with the key tracks from Ovo make this worthwhile for fans although this probably could have been pared down to a single disc focusing on those tracks and key singles/album tracks from Gabriel's other albums not included on Shaking The Tree.are--for me--two of the best tracks on 16 Golden Greats.

0790749998|2.0|This movie is nothing special, a week after u seen it u don't remember anything about the movie except for a lot of Kung-Fu kicks and that DMX was hardly in the movie...<br />U can watch RUMBLE IN THE BRONX (Jackie Chan) if u want a kung-fu movie...<br />The movie isn't bad but it isn't good either
6305546789|5.0|This was probaly the best of the Halloweens and I thoguht it stunk the first time around. Then the second time I started to appreciate Michael in a different way. I thought of him as a good guy not a bad brutal serial killer. I've seen all of them except 3,4 and ressurection but people say 3 and ressurection don't count anyway. Dr. Loomis doesn't have such a big role in this one but he sure does in the next few one's. Out of the 3 huge killers Michael's my second fave next to Freddy but Halloween's plot is so rich I could watch them all day. Jamie was good in this and she was good in 2 and H20 but this series really belongs to Donald Plesence.
B000021YQV|4.0|It's just Narley.  Only for those days when you're just in the mood for some energetic and bugged out tunes.  Inervision and Toxicity are the best song they've ever made yet in my opinion and based on what I've heard from SOAD.  I personally agree with some of the reviewers about heavy metal.  I feel that it's a way of expressing your feelings on life and it's more passionate and positive then rap.  Heavy metal gives me so much motivation at a level where it's consistent about different things and it's very unlike the bullcrap which is possibly the most listened to source of music out there called rap.  I usually listen to jazz, but I would rather prefer this over rap any day because you won't have to worry about hearing money, sex, drugs and b*tches all the time.  Although, you may also find negativity in this kind of music.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This movie is super funny but really crude. Still it's hilarious.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|First of all, let me say that I love Rush and have listened to them for years, both live and on CD.  That said, this is the worst sounding CD they have ever put out, and not because they're getting old or can't play anymore.  <br />The mix on the CD is horrible.  There's too much bass, the sound is muddy, the vocals and guitars get lost, and there's WAY WAY WAY too much crowd noise.  I can't believe this CD was professionally engineered.  It actually sounds like someone stood in the crowd with a P.O.S. DAT recorder and held up a microphone.  Actually, that is too kind...I think he was sitting on the mic for 3 hours.<br />I've tried this CD in 2 cars and on 2 home steroes and no fiddling with the EQ can bring out Geddy's vocals, Alex's guitar, or quiet the crowd.  Pity too as there are some great songs in the set. I've played this CD for others and the comments were the same: \\"where's the band?  Where's Geddy?  Are Neil and the crowd the only ones who showed up?\\"<br />If you want to hear Rush live, save your money on this one and buy Exit Stage Left or A Show of Hands.  Rush in Rio is best left in Rio.<br />What a disappointment!<br />{Update: June '04- I bought the DVD on a whim and WHAT a difference.  The DVD is great, esp. in Dolby 5.1. Maybe I'll give the CD another chance.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This collection has some of the greatest b-sides and rarities available.  I had heard a great deal of it as I spent a fortune in the early 90's buying the European Maxi-singles that harbored many of the great b-sides.  It surprises me that some of these songs never made it to any of the records themselves. . . Pearl Jam does not have notoriously long albums, so there is room for more, and much of this would have been worthy of being included. <br />In my opinion there really was not anything missing that I had heard and loved. (except \\"Crazy Mary\\" but I have it on a dozen of the \\"Official Bootlegs\\")<br />Highlights are many in this ragtag group of 30 tracks that span more than a decade's body of work.  Staples like \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" and \\"Footsteps\\"(which has been altered to include a harmonica, very nice!) are present and sound as good as they ever have.  It is interesting that a great deal of the B-sides have aged a better than the records.   The first two Pearl Jam records while classic, have a distinct \\"fuzzy grunge\\" style in their instrumentation.  This makes them sound time specific as many artists of the time used similar effects.  It is nice that some of said effects have been removed from the album tracks in the live performance and they no longer sound dated. The early B-sides are less \\"finished\\" than the albums were, so they lack some of the slight overproduction of the early albums.<br />The inclusion of some of the tracks from the annual fanclub Christmas singles was a great choice.  I am really happy that I now have a copy of \\"Let Me Sleep (It's Christmas Time)\\" that doesn't sound like it was recorded in a tin can under water.  Several others from the Christmas Singles include \\"Last Kiss,\\" \\"Strangest Tribe,\\" and \\"Drifting.\\" All great songs.  I was not all that impressed with the version of \\"wash\\" that was used.  The one from the single was better, but it is always nice to hear something different.  \\"Alone\\" was a solid version but again, different fromthe \\"Go\\" b-side.<br />I would have to say that \\"Fatal\\" is the gem of the records.  It is one of the finest songs in Pearl Jam's history.  Simple and melodic, it has an amazing amount of feeling.  There are songs on Lost Dogs that I do not care all that much for, but there are so many that are great that I could not imagine giving this less than five stars.  It is a definitive collection of Pearl Jam's unreleased material.<br />epc
B00004ZAV3|3.0|No one will argue that many of the Beatles most popular songs can be found on this album.  When putting together any compilation of Beatles songs there are two immediate problems.  The first is that there the Beatles created too much good music to include on any one compilation album.  The second is that the record labels feel the need to 'digitally remaster' the songs.  I think, to some degree, that music, like movies, are meant to be listened to in their originally sound.  A film director puts together a very different story if filming in black and white as oppossed to color.  I think the Beatles also directed much of their music (especially their early music) to the recording and playback technologies available in the 1960's and 70's.  I would love for a collection of Beatles tunes to be released that includes the faint hiss and occaisional pop of a needle on vinyl.  We have all the digitally remastered versions we need.  Now its time for someone to release a Beatles compilation album that lets us hear the music in the same way we heard it that first time, scratches, pops, hisses and all!!!!!!
B00000JG41|5.0|No one is ever going to talk me out of saying that this is album truly is one of the greatest musical experiences of all time.  It is different and psychotic and unusual, but is also genius, eclectic and beautiful.  Musicality is boundless on this album.  It seems like these guys listed to every album on the planet and then sat down and put this masterpiece together.  Man, I'm rambling because the joy this album brings me causes me to babble on and on about it ad naseum.  So, here's a song by song:<BR>Sweet Charity - A great opener.  Beautiful Beach Boys like song that just makes you feel happy as hell. A sing=a=long if there ever was one, and the guitars are awesome.  Makes the title California valid.<BR>None of Them Knew they were Robots - Manic, chaotic swing that always seems on the verge of falling apart.  But that's part of what makes it great.  It's insane genius exploding everywhere on this track.  The guitars seem to twist swing into a depraved mockery of itself.  <br />Retrovertigo - A quiet, dreamy song with great chord changes and great Patton vocals.  The climax at the end is earht shatteringly beautiful.<BR>THe Air Conditioned Nightmare - Another really catchy Beachy BOys type of song that has been Bungleized into something completely original.  Great lyrics and great vocal harmonies really make this song something special.<BR>Ars Moriendi - A cartoonish type of song with almost Arabic melodies.  This song is so depraved and great that it leaves you feeling spent but wanting another listen, just to make sure you actually heard something that cool.  Some of the best music on the album.<BR>Pink Cigarette - my favorite on the album.  It is a slower track with great instrumental melodies and a truly moving vocal.  There is a great musical push and pull in this song that pushes this song from climax to climax, ending with an emotionally wreching finale.<BR>Golem II - QUirky, funny, and funky.  Sounds like first album bungle updated and twisted.  Cool, coolsong to get up and funk out to.<BR>The Holy Filament - A lush musical soundscape makes this song go over the top, with spare but good vocals.  Almost New Age keyboards but much, much better.<BR>Vanity Fair - A gospel type song with great melodies in the vocal and saxophone parts.  Short and sweet, but great nonetheless.<BR>Goodbye Sober Day - A song for all who are losing their minds.  This one is nuts.  It goes all over the place with chanting and a crushing ending.  The perfect conclusion.<br />An album to put on whenever wherever, it does what all great things are supposed to do; challenge and excite you.  It's a musical experience not to be missed.
B000000643|3.0|I love early Fairport Convention and Sandy Denny.  &quot;What We Did On Our Holidays&quot; is still one of my favorite albums ever.<br />This album, Unhalfbricking, has never really reached that level for me.  After many, many listenings, I still find it to be a weaker effort in many ways.  I know that this album is revered over &quot;Holidays&quot; as being their finest moment, but I will have to disagree with that assessment.  The problems for me are:<br />1.  Too many covers, not enough originals.  Three Dylan covers (and fairly bizarre choices at that), and one traditional song.  I would rather have more Thompson and Denny originals.<br />2.  The Dylan covers aren't that special.  &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot; is raucous, unpolished and fun enough, but lack's Dylan's bite.  &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot; is a nothing more than a curious novelty -- &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; sung in French.  It doesn't do much for me.  And &quot;Percy's Song&quot; is nice, FOR A WHILE.  But then it hits the third problem...<br />3.  Some of the songs are just too long.  &quot;Percy's Song&quot; is about seven minutes of repetitiveness.  Verse after verse after verse.  Dylan's song was a big long story, and I frankly get mighty sick of it about halfway through.  It needs a bridge, a key change, *something.*  But it just keeps going on and on in the same way, through a ton of verses.  And &quot;A Sailor's Life&quot; has a repetitive instrumental passage that is much, much too long.<br />4.  There are only eight songs.  Too bad they didn't truncate or eliminate some of the longer ones altogether in order to provide more songs.<br />5.  The track sequencing is schizophrenic.  Sort of hops around stylistically, and doesn't really hit a good flow.<br />That said, the 3 star rating is only for the album overall.  But &quot;Who Knows Where The Time Goes?&quot; is such a 5-star classic song, you simply MUST own this album just to have that song.  And don't get me wrong, the restof the album is not bad -- it's just not on par with &quot;Holidays,&quot; and has a few problems as mentioned above, so it gets less stars.
B0000630BT|1.0|What ... is this? It's like Spinal tap turned into a reality! I don't like any of Judas priest's music, but this is just plain [bad]. This album contains almost every Metal cliche you can possibly think of. Listen to this if you want to know WHY the market for traditional Metal dried up by the end of 1991. The only saving grace is Halford's voice.<br />Oh, and I have something to say to all the metalheads out there: Wearing Judas priest tee shirts, obnoxiously shouting \\"Up the irons!\\" every five minutes, and mindlessly bashing Death metal and Black metal all the time does not make you \\"real\\" or \\"true\\". It just makes you a tool. Later.
B00005OADE|4.0|If 1974 was a difficult year for Uriah Heep, 1976 would prove even more disastrous. Former bassist Gary Thain would be found dead of a drug overdose in December 1975, an omen of things to come; relations between the band and manager/producer Gerry Bron grew sour, resulting in the band self-producing that year's largely ill-conceived \\"High and Mighty\\" album; and finally, what appeared to be the crushing and irrecoverable blow: singer David Byron, whose incredible voice practically defined the band, was spiralling down into a tragic abyss of alcohol abuse and increasingly erratic drunken  behavior (including cursing out the stunned audience at one show), which finally resulted in his firing. (Byron would go on to attempt an unsuccessful solo career, before drinking himself to death in 1985). Recently hired bassist John Wetton, who was dissatisfied with the musical direction of \\"High and Mighty\\", and who was close to Byron personally, would quit shortly afterward, leaving the band in a state of near-collapse.    Miraculously, the remaining members, organist and primary writer Ken Hensley, guitarist Mick Box, and drummer Lee Kerslake, were not only able to resurrect the band phoenix-like from the ashes, but produce an excellent first effort from the new lineup, which would be rounded out by Trevor Bolder, who had played with David Bowie's Spiders From Mars, on bass, and former Lucifer's Friend vocalist John Lawton. (Bolder was a particularly inspired choice; except for a brief period in the early 1980s, he has remained in the band to this day). \\"Firefly\\", recorded in 1977, is an impressive debut, with some of Ken's best songwriting, and a much tighter and more focused approach with Gerry Bron back in the producer's chair.    Particular standouts (although every track is excellent) are \\"Who Needs Me\\", a rare (and fun) songwriting contribution from Kerslake, \\"Wise Man\\", one of Ken's prettiest and most inspiring ballads, with an absolutely amazing vocal from Lawton, who insome ways has a more powerful voice than Byron, although not as unique and emotionally moving, \\"Do You Know\\", a fun, fast-paced hard rocker, the moody \\"Rollin' On\\", \\"Sympathy\\", where Lawton practically conjures the spirit of David Byron near the end, and the epic multi-sectional closing title track, with Ken handling much of the lead vocals. Guitarist Mick Box particularly shines throughout the album, with tasteful and tasty guitar work on every song.    The bottom line: a surprising comeback that ranks as an excellent album; if not quite at the level of, say \\"Sweet Freedom\\", it certainly stands comfortably alongside, say, \\"Return to Fantasy\\". A must for Heepsters, and highly recommended to everyone else as well. 4 1/2 stars.
B0000035E7|5.0|So go buy it. The whole album is hard, heavy, and rockin'. The best songs on the album would have to be Scoff, Blew, and About A Girl, but they are all really good. Thanks for the great music Kurt.
B00008OWZC|5.0|In response to boogaloojef who says that JPJ could not play bass and keyboards at the same time in concert, he actually did. He had foot pedals for bass lines. Also used this when he played mandolin. Check out the cd and you can see and hear the bass. No much I can say about the CD, it speaks for itself.
B0000BWVCM|3.0|Granted, I'm coming late to the party, having just viewed X2 for the first time. But I was so frustrated and disappointed with one aspect of the movie, the mishandling of the Cyclops/Scott Summers character, that I was unable to enjoy an otherwise solid effort. I was initially surprised with the minimal role this character played in Brian Singer's first XMen movie, but understood that because of the exposition required in a first movie, the popularity of the Wolverine character, and the need to appeal to non-comic book fans it was necessary to focus on other areas. But this is ridiculous. Cyclops/Summers has an even smaller role in this second movie and is completely emasculated in an effort to make the Wolverine character more appealing. Has Singer even read the comic book? The Cyclops/Summers character is the first XMan, is one of the three or four most popular characters over the years and has been more than a match for the Wolverine character; they are perfect foils for each other. Obviously, Singer needs to please a wider film-going audience, but he also has a responsibility to be true to the source material. To relegate a complex, dynamic character to an also-ran role is to contradict forty plus years of comics. X2 teases us with the possibility (likelihood?) of a third movie in the series. Here would be a good place to right this wrong. The casting of James Marsden as Cyclops might also merit some reconsideration. While Marsden does no real wrong, he simply does not have the onscreen presence to match Hugh Jackman, nor does he have any chemistry with Famke Janssen. In the Cyclops-Jean Grey-Wolverine troika, Marsden is clearly the weak link, and may have something to do with the focus away from his character. Here's hoping Brian Singer addresses this error and gives the audience a movie that reflects the real XMen. Third time could be the charm.
B000001OAA|5.0|I came to this album only very late in the game, and I have to say:  better late than never.  I knew Garbage by reputation, a reputation that was strengthened when I agreed to take into my home two completely black cats, sisters named Tori (after Tori Amos) and Shirley (after Shirley Manson).  Finally, to learn more about my kitty's namesake I gave this album a try, and I was absolutely shocked at how great it is.<br />The amazing thing about this album is that on the surface it is almost a punk album, with a tough exterior, hard driving rhythms, edgy production, and extraordinary arrangements.  But somehow, partly because of the stunningly musical nature of each cut and partly because of the breathy, almost girlish quality of the vocals by my cat's namesake, the songs comes across as more pop than alternative.<br />There really isn't a bad cut on the album, and several of them are quite exceptional.  The album begins on a strong note with the rasping, gritty \\"Supervixen\\" before moving into the spectacular \\"Queer, \\" which is one of the greatest songs on the album.  It proceeds on to such marvelous pop masterpieces, as \\"I'm Only Happy When It Rains \\"and\\" Vow.\\"  Not all of the songs are as good as they appear to be.  \\"Not My Idea\\" for instance is a decent song that is made memorable by stunning arrangement.  The care and crafting that goes into every song is remarkable in this way.<br />I'm still not certain that I would have been inspired to name my cat after Shirley Manson had I gotten her as a kitten, but I am now definitely a fan of the band.  This is one those discs that is going to spin significant time in the future in my CD player.
0061015725|1.0|The first one hundred pages of this book focused primarily on the protagonist's suspicion that his wife was having an affair.  Incredibly, he shrugs off his son's claim that his wife had men in the house while he was at the hospital having his desperately ill child treated for a suspicious illness.  The book is unbelievably slow and boring.  I gave up after the first one hundred pages.  Pass on this one.

B000063DFN|4.0|Iron Maiden, along with Judas Priest and Motorhead, were among the founders of the &quot;New Wave Of British Metal&quot; (NWOBM) movement, an offshoot of heavy metal that took the blues-based hard rock of Black Sabbath and Deep Purple and the minimalist uptempo rock of the punk movement and combined them into a new form, from which the thrash, power metal, and death/black metal genres were derived.<br />1984's Powerslave was third in a brilliant series of albums featuring the one and only &quot;Air Raid Siren&quot;--Bruce Dickinson. His soaring, powerful vocal is perhaps the most distinctive and best in metal. Dickinson's voice varies from near-operatic high ranges to a pleasingly aggressive growl. Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are wonderful guitarists, managing fluid and fast dual guitar harmonies (always a Maiden trademark) with ease, and Steve Harris is a fine bassist whose prominence in the mix is always welcome.<br />Iron Maiden was never a master of subtlety, from the silly cover art usually featuring the band's skeletonized mascot Eddie to the lyrics, which are full of big epic subject matter (usually historical events and mythology), and the music is made to suit. While occassionally Powerslave suffers from a small amount of Iron Maiden Cheese (TM), if melodic, driving metal is your thing Iron Maiden always delivers with power and consistency.<br />The album opens up on a strong note with Aces High, the breakneck ode to WWII air combat. Other highlights include the apocalyptic imagery of 2 Minutes To Midnight, two songs dedicated to swordfighting (Flash Of The Blade, The Dualists) which are chock full of cool instrumental passages, and the killer Egyptian-themed title track which is perhaps my all-time favorite Maiden song. The album concludes with the famous epic Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, a 14-minute masterpiece dedicated to the Coleridge poem of the same name.<br />Powerslave is absolutely essential to the metal conoisseur. Also reccommended are Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind...hell, pretty much everything up to and including Seventh Son Of Seventh Son. In addition, check out Bruce Dickinson's solo material as well, which is vastly underrated.er Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind...hell, pretty much everything up to and including Seventh Son Of Seventh Son.

B00000ILDE|5.0|My sons, who are now in the mid to later teens, have attached themselves to the Aliens thing due to this movie and the first original \\"Alien\\". They have brought them to school where the first reaction from this high school generation is, \\"Huh? What's Aliens about?\\" Well like we found out back in the day, they find out now in the 21st century and are hooked just the same. Awesome Sci-Fi flick in a class by itself that holds up to todays computer generated stuff in spades. Well done, well acted and action and tension filled. My kids only regrets are the same as mine, after Alien and Aliens the others in the series took a dive, what a shame. Buy the first two in the Alien series and hang onto your seats (and plasma rifles)!! <br />\\"Semper Fi\\" Colonial Marines!

B000002G7E|4.0|When I first started reviewing music last year, my opinion of White Light/White Heat was of the utmost hatred. Why did it have to be so noisy, so inaccessible? Where's the pretty, folky melodies of the self-titled album, or the unique avant-garage pop of VU & Nico? Why did it have to sound like it was recorded in a tin can? I sold my copy after the first two listens.<br />Well, over the year my tastes in music have broadened dramatically, expanding to include punk, indie, metal, jazz, fusion, prog, and so on. As such, when I went back and gave the second VU album another chance, to my surprise I found it listenable, at times catchy even. So much for first impressions. Still, this album is definitely not for the casual VU fan (maybe it's better that way). This is raw, violent, dense, harsh. This is night music, as dark as the pitch-black album cover and the eerie photos of the band suggest.<br />Sure, White Light/White Heat was recorded as lo-fi as can be, but I found that this gave it an intensity and spikiness that was generally lacking from the more genteel VU & Nico. The melodies are buried under intense feedback that sear the synapses. Lou Reed's singing and guitarwork are manic and sloppy (listen to that completely unhinged solo at the end of I Heard Her Call My Name), Moe Tucker's drums pound away in a tribal manner, and John Cale's instrumentation (viola, electric organ) is skilled yet hidden in the chaos.<br />The album's title track is a catchy '50s-style rocker (complete with piano) and the only thing on here approaching a pop song. While this a great song, there is a better-recorded and longer version on the 1969 live album. The Gift is a really weird spoken word piece, with Cale's cool, affected voice reciting a urban poem (which ends in a really dark and surprising twist, listen for it) while the band jams away in the other channel. Lady Godiva's Operation is the extremely effed-up and effectively creepy tale of a sex change operation. Here She Comes Now is a snide, gritty Lou ballad which sets the listener up for the frantic feedback blowout of I Heard Her Call My Name.<br />Then there's Sister Ray. A 17-minute jam of total sonic debauchery, with a very drugged-up Lou sneering the lyrics while the rest of the band turns up their respective instruments to be heard above the din and confusion. It spirals outward to a fuzzed-out, furious climax. NOBODY is ambivalent about this song. You either learn to appreciate its seemingly chaotic grooves or completely despise it. It makes the previous album's noisy, droning jam European Son pale in comparison.<br />After listening to this album over and over for the past week, I keep finding new sounds and grooves within each song, and realize that my previous opinions about this release were gravely mistaken. As such, I can finally appreciate White Light/White Heat's place within the Velvet Underground canon and its influence on punk and indie music. Just start with VU & Nico first before coming here, and be prepared for a truly challenging experience.es Now is a snide, gritty Lou ballad which sets the listener up for the frantic feedback blowout of I Heard Her Call My Name. <br />Then there's Sister Ray.

0679720200|3.0|Without a doubt one of the most important books of the 20th century, The Stranger is a classic piece of literature and one of the literary pillars of existentialism, a movement that continues to color the way we see the world.<br />The storyline is very simple: a young and aimless Algerian immigrant to France, Meursault, unmoved by his mother's death, becomes involved in petty events beyond his control and ends up killing someone. The trial is a ridiculous farce, and the real art comes from the way Meursault dispassionately describes the events overtaking him: the funeral, the trial, the sentencing. The story is at once beautiful and unsettling.<br />Of course, none of this is anything that hasn't already been said among the other reviews here. What prompted me to write a review about this now (after all, I had first read this story more than 20 years ago and have only re-read parts of it recently) is the new and much-heralded translation from Matthew Ward. Mr. Ward's work has been almost universally praised by critics, who have called it an essential update and a production that will make the book more accessible to American audiences.<br />That may be so, but I can't escape the feeling that it also cheapens this great book. I realize that some traditionalists will always accuse a modern translator of a classic piece of literature of tampering with art. But even if I keep that in mind as I read The Stranger in its newest form, I still get that sinking feeling.<br />Take the opening paragraph, for example. I have always considered the opening lines in The Stranger among the best in the western literary cannon, and they seem to lose firepower in Mr. Ward's version of the story: \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe. I don't know. I got a telegram from the home: `Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn't mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday.\\"<br />Compare that to the classic Stuart Gilbert translation that is familiar to most English speakers to have read this book: \\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. The telegram from the Home says: `Your mother passed away. Funeral tomorrow. Deep sympathy.' Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\\"<br />Don't the short and choppy sentences of the telegram contrast strongly to the emotionless as-a-matter-of-fact narrative from Meursault in the second example? And isn't that lost in the newer version when both Meursault and the telegram have the same tone? The Meursault from Mr. Ward's translation always talks that way, giving the impression that he actually puts a bit of thought into what should be his dispassionate commentary, rather than just speaking in meandering run-on sentences as someone simply going through the motions would (and the way author Albert Camus described Meursault in later years).<br />Also, who is Maman? I'm not sure I would recognize the word as a form of \\"mother\\" if I weren't already familiar with the story.<br />In sum, the value of The Stranger is beyond doubt. But consider the issue of the translations strongly, and, if possible, consider one of the older translations that create a story closer to what I believe Mr. Camus intended and not something that may have been crafted to subtly reshape the story for modern audiences.s to have read this book: \\"Mother died today.

B0000A9GLS|5.0|My son brought this film home from the local rental place  and, though having never heard of it, I decided to watch it on the strength of the cast, which is stellar. I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric,  and intriguing  thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy  motel in the middle of nowhere.<br />There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently  a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that  opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues.<br />There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, &quot;Gotcha!&quot;.<br />This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy.  There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep even the most jaded viewers on their toes. While the performances of the entire cast are uniformly excellent, special kudos go to John Cusack for a truly powerful, memorable performance. Bravo!
B00006AW2G|5.0|At least thats what the group should have been called at this particular juncture. However they still came out with their best album. The music and the songs are both exceptional. Due to Brian Jones being sacked by Jagger/Richards for being too stoned for even the stones and the replacement Mick Taylor only sitting in on a couple of numbers the guitar work is handled almost exclusively by Keith Richards and it's a revalation. The way Jimmy Miller produces Richards' electric guitar and Jagger's harp give the album a unique sound. There are two outstanding blues numbers, Johnson's Love in Vain and the Richards' vocal (there he is again) You Got the Silver. The other songs Jagger populates with weird characters like something from a B horror movie. There is the country bum in Country Honk, the demented lord of the manor in Live With Me, the drop out hippy in Let it Bleed (a parody on the Beatles Let it Be), the jester in Monkey Man and of course Jack the Ripper in Midnight Rambler. An unsavoury bunch if ever there was. All this is sandwiched between the classic Gimmie Shelter and like all good sinners  they reach repentance at the end with You Can't Always Get What You Want which has an appearance by the London Bach Choir, probably the only people who weren't stoned on this particular recording. By the way did you notice the difference in theology with the Beatles saying let it be and the stones saying you can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you get what you need?  <br />Honkey Tonk Women from these sessions was their last UK number one and marked the beginning of their decline there. The question always was who do like, the Beatles or the Stones? After the Beatles broke up in 1970 the question was already who do like, Led Zep or 10 Years After. They had a slight return to form spurned on by the punk movement at the end of the 70's but never really recaptured their 60's greatness.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|No offense intended (well, maybe some), but it's really hard for me to take seriously anyone's opinion regarding this release who refers to Paul McCartney as &quot;Sir Paul.&quot;  I realize he has been knighted, but your inclusion of this title really makes some of you folks sound like total dorks.  You don't have to suck up in this forum, people.  I realize this issue is somewhat irrelevant to the discussion, but it bugs me, A LOT.
B000000OE7|4.0|Yes, I love Queen's 70s. Yes, I love Innuendo like crazy. Still, this album is so worth buying... even if it makes you think of what more would have flown out of Freddie if he were only alive today.<br />The best song here, I think, is &quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot;. Yes, it is a pop-style, yes it sounds like a solo rather than Queen, but it really reveals Freddie's undying genius and delivery. <br />A Winter's Tale, Freddie's last song, is of course beautiful. Others such as Let Me Live and My Life Has Been Saved are tear-inducing. When it gets to Mother Love, however, I sort of get angry... I understand this is posthumous album, but the production did not have to be indicative of the fact to this obvious state. <br />Just because it broke my heart again and again and again (and still now) I can't be insensitive to my never-ending assumptions - what if Freddie were still alive... what if? what if? I keep asking and get sick of it.<br />In all, you will not regret buying it, but you will be really sad. And this album was made to do exactly that.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is simply the greatest fictionalization of World War II ever put down on film and deserves the highest praise for its grit, depth, and realism.  Grueling at times and light as a feather at others, this miniseries will run you through the ringer of emotions and you'll leave feeling a stronger person so involved in the trials and tribulations of Easy Company that you'll feel you're actually an intimate part of this band of brothers - they will enter your consciousness and stick with you.  I am by no means a WWII buff, I just like good movies with good stories and this is one of the best I've ever seen.
B00003CXE7|5.0|whoa---this was my reaction after seeing this movie...at first, i wasn't thrilled about it, cuz i thought it was a story of just a bunch of gladiators hacking and slashing each other in the colosseum---but its way more than that!!! it has such an amazing story, and not to mention an awesome cast!! russell crowe is such an amazing actor, and i also thought joaquin phoenix was awesome too (even though he played an evil character, he did a good job on doing his part).the battle scene in the beginning is awesome and so are the fights in the colosseum---you feel as if you're one of the colosseum spectators!!! if you wanna good action movie with a good story, BUY THIS!!! definitely worth the money. the extras are good too.<br />ps---get the soundtrack, its just as good as the movie!!!!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is an enjoyable, easy to read book.  It is classified as a SciFi book, although it does not suffer from long, technical explanations.  As soon as I started to read it, I found it very difficult to put the book down.  Although the book is short, it has a good morale to it.  There is a lot of great action in the book, although the book is based on the character, not fighting.<br />The main character in the book is Ender, a young boy that is training to be a military officer.  Unfortunately for him, he has been chosen to become a great commander, and must go through trials his other peers do not have to face.  This book follows Ender from the age of six to right before starting adolescence.  The reader will experience the significant trials Ender most go from, from both his teachers, and his fellow peers.<br />The only flaw with the book is that the ending was a bit dry.  It did fit in with the rest of the story, but in my opinion, it could have been a little bit more developed.  The ending was horrible however, and the book only suffers very slightly for it.  I would recommend everyone that is looking for a short, great book to read Ender's Game.
B000000OAA|5.0|Sheer Heart Attack, with A Night At the Opera and Queen II, will entertain anyone and everyone for the rest of their lives. Every single song is where it should be. <br />Brighton Rock boasts Freddie Mercury's very feminine (or childlike) falsetto in the beginning, and Brian May's guitar is dazzling and astounding. This song is also May's favourite guitar solo repertoire in concerts.<br />Killer Queen is, in my very personal opinion, the essence of Mercury's finesse in its purest form. From the beginning to end it is slick, graceful, light yet tense at the same time, like a wound-up cat. The lyric is decadant, yet amusing and very connotative.<br />Tenement Funster is one of Roger Taylor's best vocals in Queen albums. The guitar is harmonious yet strangely touching. Roger's heavy and stony voice is a very good contrast to Freddie's jem-like one. A great song.<br />Flick Of The Wrist... (gasp out) This song will knock out anyone with its sheer masterful instruments (Piano, drum, guitar, bass.... perfect) and delicate yet powerful vocal. In my mind a song as great an epic as Bohemian Rhapsody, March of the Black Queen or Prophet's Song. Can't say this is closer to the earlier Queen style... but how can anyone resist this masterpiece?<br />Lily Of The Valley is as lovely and beautiful as the Love of My Life and as philosophical as... well... anything! The lyric of this song is very Biblical, yet one can detect the fundamental depth into self-reflection and understanding of the speaker's own persona.<br />Now I'm Here starts with a simplistic staccato guitar playing and Mercury's soft vocal, and delightfully surprises the listener with Mercury's \\"elastic\\" voice and heavy instrument. A good concert material and a pleasing song.<br />In The Lap Of The Gods... What can I say more about this most underrated song... Just listen and you will enter a new world in itself. Possibly one of shortest and most \\"diverse\\" songs of Queen. True, a difficult to song to stomach at first... (for me, at least) Listen to other songs and come back to it a little while later. The world will look differently.<br />Stone Cold Crazy is one of the more \\"80's\\" attempts of Queen's... Although it is a rock song, it is a precursor to Sheer Heart Attack the song, but that is simply my opinion. (Ironic that the actual song is not in the album of the same title.) \\"Machine-like\\" sounds in the beginning, but sophisticated guitar playing combined with Mercury's incomparable vocal makes the song enjoyable.<br />Dear Friends... this is what \\"God Save the Queen\\" is to A Night In the Opera, but 1000000 times better because of Mercury's voice. I have no idea why this song isn't as popular as it should be... perhaps it is too short.<br />Misfire is John Deacon's pleasant and funny song. Light-hearted, acoustic, romantic (or erotically comical, if you so insist). Mercury's falsetto is impossibly high, clean and pleasing to anyone.<br />Bring Back That Leroy Brown is one of my personal favourites. A 20's style, yet so Queen... I don't even know how a rock band can sound like this. This is one of the songs that hooked me (a jazz fan) into rock.<br />She Makes Me is an enjoyable song... well, personally I tend to think that May's vocal is a little weak, especially compared to Mercury's. (But who can even compare to Mercury?) Still, a delightful nice song.<br />Although I can name many other good songs from their earlier and even later albums, this album is actually my most favourite. Queen II, although grand and gorgeous, is a little heavy for casual listening. (Strangely, March of the Black Queen is one song that is not heavy to me) A Night At the Opera is a bijou, but some of the songs are not too much of my taste. This album suits any of my mood like a perfect fit. Mercury's voice is at his height. (Although I also love his more \\"musical-like\\" voice in the 80's.) <br />OK, people out there, just buy it. This album deserves 100000 stars.
B00005JMCW|5.0|You know one of those movies were when you get out of the theater and all you here is I can't waite till this move comes out on DVD. Well Freaky Friday is one of those movies! It's a movie were a daughter and mother swich bodies with a mysterious fortune cookie and every thing gets wacky! It is also very heartwarming at the end so if you like wack and heatwarming Freaky Friday is the movie for you. Don't forget that the DVD has Bloopers that are pretty funny and other Special Features!!
B00004YC2F|5.0|I consider the Rach Third Piano Concerto to be my favorite romantic concerto. I have heard many recordings of this piece, including the Horowitz version with Philiadelphia Orch, and the video with Zubin Mehta. Volodos's command of the piece is Astonishing to say the least. I feel Volodos pulls off every facet needed to play this great piece. He has the virtoustic power of Horowitz and the needed sensitivity to bring out the concerto's darker and more expressive sides.<BR>All in all a truely fantastic recording worthy of all praise.
0780020685|5.0|A serious contender for &quot;best film ever made&quot;.<br />In spite of being 3+ hours long, Kurosawa handles the pace so deftly that it scarcely seems that long at all. About as perfectly balanced as you could hope a film to be; the humourous, lighthearted aspects complement the starker, unromantic depictions of peasant existence, which in turn are meshed expertly with the adeptlt-filmed action sequences. Emotional and compelling, stylish and profound, all at once. If there were a rating above 5-stars, I'd award it.
B000000OA6|5.0|We can ask ourselves a question: if Freddie Mercury were still alive now, would Queen have continued? Or would they have broken up like the Beatles? Which one is more heartaching - watching your idol and legend step down from the pedestal and break up, or watching your idol die? <br />Some people say that Innuendo was great because it was Queen's swan song - perhaps so, and perhaps not. The album is very poignant, and to fans, very sad. Yet, I feel that Freddie's approaching death, or desperation, may have been a factor that really tightened the unity that was Queen.<br />I was checking out some reviews of Queen albums today, and saw an interesting review that said that Innuendo was rather rough, relaxed and not well arranged enough. It's up to the individual judgment to decide that. I'm no musical expert, and I admit that I rely on other people's insights in order to study the musical structure of the songs. Yet, to me at least (and to many other people), Queen really did bring it and reached up there with this album. To say that it is not so is too careless a remark.<br />Innuendo greets the listener with a furious intensity. Mercury's vocal is clearer than ever in this album, with an incredibly high head voice. This song traces back to the non-repetitive epic numbers featured often in the 70s albums and once in the Miracle (Was It Worth It - the most wondrous 80s song). The purcussion and the Spanish guitar are striking. <br />I'm Going Slightly Mad is certainly very bizarre - both in melody and little sounds that accompany. Yet, this song is one of my personal Queen favorites and certainly its music video is the best of Queen except Save Me and These Are the Days of Our Lives. The vocal is haunting and low, and the bass, simply gorgeous - I go mad listening to it.<br />Headlong - currently the track I listen to most often. I'm so glad Brian decided to use this song for Queen instead of his solo album. This song works way better with Freddie's vocal. An interesting arrangement with interesting lyric.<br />I Can't Live With You - First I thought it was the worst song of the album, and now it's one of the tops. Unfortunately Roger did not play the drum - it was programmed. The structure is quite simplistic, but the melody really grows on you. <br />Don't Try So Hard - simply the best ballad, I like this song even better than the earlier ballads such as Nevermore. Synth works really really well with the vocal. And the guitar - simply beautiful. It's not even complicated, yet it's so stately and emotional. The drum culminates the climax.<br />Ride the Wild Wind - A very fascinating drumming. Roger's side remarks are quite amusing, and Freddie vocal again is flawlessly low. <br />All God's People - I really didn't like this song from the start (maybe because it had so little Freddie solo vocal). Yet, it inherits the gospel tradition all the way from Somebody to Love (which is a great song itself.) A simpler arrangement would be more interesting...<br />These Are the Days of Our Lives - Roger's absolute masterpiece, and honestly, although I do like George Michael, his tribute vocal doesn't do justice.<br />Delilah - many fans hate this song. I understand why, but I still like this song - very very Freddie and cute. Even Brian's guitar sounds like a cat. <br />The Hitman - A wonderful, heavy metal number. Brian's play is really... enjoyable (I can't put it any other way: the solos are not exceptionally complicated yet very catchy), especially in the middle solo. <br />Bijou: truly a bijou. A very very short but crystal clear Freddie vocal with Brian's classical and solemn guitar solo.<br />And as to the last song, The Show Must Go On, I'll just quote Brian on this.<br />\\"My tribute really was The Show Must Go On. There's a lot in there. I remember writing this line -- 'my soul is painted like the wings of butterflies' -- and I brought it to him one morning, a little worried about what he would think of it. I said, 'Do you think that's okay? Can you sing that?' And he went, 'Darling, I can sing that and I will give it my all.' Because he knew what it was all about and it didn't need to be said.\\"<br />Long Live my Queen.
1878424319|4.0|I'm not much of a New Age fanatic, but this book was good. One of my favorite pieces of advice from the book was how you shouldn't worry about what other people think, because they live in their own distorted versions of reality and you have to create your own version to make it heaven. A cool book.
B000001F7R|1.0|Run for the hills, stay clear of this cd, nothing on hear that even resembles the Leppard of the mid 80's and above.  Production is horrible as well as the playing, singing and song writing.  RUN,RUN, RUN.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|britney who is britney is what they'll be saying shortly. Its sad that you have to take off you clothes to sell music.

0385507755|5.0|I haven't read a novel in 15 years, and I am so glad that I pick-up this book.  Frey describes feelings, emotions and physical anguish so distinctly that it felt like it was the one in detox.  I literally could not put it down at times.  A very engaging, real and dramatic story.
B00005JKNF|5.0|because you miss most of the film the first time around!<br />On the surface this appears to be a very formulistic murder mystery.  It has the classic setting, 1930's period, an isolated English manor house filled with guests for a weekend shooting party, and all of the servants both resident and visiting.  Everybody has secrets, the tension is so thick it could be cut with a knife and there is conveniently one missing from the kitchen.  For more than half the film we see motives offered and wait for the murder and yet after it occurs it becomes evident that this is NOT a murder mystery at all!<br />The film has been compared to Upstairs Downstairs and it does involve the lives of those both above and below stairs, but it is much more than that.  The various stories are added layer by layer some, such as the imposter in the servants' hall are obvious while others like the secret abortion are only alluded in a couple of lines.  The various stories are, while interesting, not really the point of the film either.  This is a beautifully drawn portrait of a way of life that is long gone and will probably never return.  Almost everyone has read about or seen depictions of English Country Life in the '20's and '30's. It is a setting that has been used in drama, comedy, romance and of course mystery genres for years but Gosford Park makes it clear that we have only the faintest ideas of what that life was really like.  The genius of this film is that it takes all the information that could have been spread out in a PBS documentary series and used fiction to illustrate the same points in a much more effective and enjoyable way.<br />The cast is huge and filled with actors, both well known and soon to be well known.  No one is given such a large role that it becomes their film and yet each performer manages to turn their scenes into a polished little gem.<br />The extras included in the DVD are wonderful.  They include deleted scenes (with commentary), features on the makingof, and authenticity of the movies as well as Q &amp; A with cast and filmakers.  The best of the extras by far are the commentaries with the director, Robert Altman and screenwriter, Julian Oscar.<br />I highly recommend the purchase (as opposed to the renting) of this film.  It is so packed with detail that it would be impossible to absorb it all in just one or two viewings.
B000001DVD|3.0|Def's HIGH-N-DRY, should be named low-n-damp.  The cd only on one occasion rises above the metal of that day, and that is on the classic BRINGIN ON THE HEARTBREAK.  Rest of the time there is nothing to seperate them from all the other metal hopefulls of that day.  Playing is average and writing below.  Skip this cd and by there hits cd, the VAULT.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This man is amazing. I was fortunate enough to be introduced to this band's music by seeing them live. Andrew W K treats the fans like old friends. Between performing the songs with amazing amounts of head banging energy he stops to share his philosophy on life and welcome the crowd onto the stage en masse. This guy deserves every good thing that can come to him. After buying his CD and listening to it, I felt like I had been given an infusion of energy and good vibes. This album is for all of us that need to be reminded to live & love like tomorrow might not come. Don't let life get you down! Buy this CD! And turn it up!
1582432678|4.0|Maximum devastation...<br />Upon finishing this book I knew that any preconceived notions or ideas that I had about motherhood and unconditional love had been sent out the proverbial window.<br />Other reviews have rehashed the description of the story so I will not bother with that.  Let me simply say that this book is devastating (there's that word again), shocking, decidedly un-PC and very, very honest.<br />I am disturbed however by the blurb on the back of my galley copy that describes \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" as an \\"undergound feminist hit\\".  What in God's name does that mean?  Why feminist?  Because a strong woman serves as the narrator (love or hate her you must admit that Eva is a strong woman)?  Because it is \\"feminist\\" to admit that you don't always like-let-alone-love your children?  I think this label detracts from the amazing story told within this book's pages...don't read this book because it is a \\"feminist story\\"; read it because it is an AMAZING story!
6305657947|5.0|This remake of the highly rated Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway film is that rarest of all films, a remake that is as good if not better than the origninal.  The plot centers on Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), a Donald Trump like businessman who indulges in many exciting and expensive hobbies - racing catamarans, sail planes, golf (with huge side bets) and art theft.  He sets up and pulls off an elaborate theft that sets the NYPD and insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) on his trail.  She quickly sees through his innocent bystander pose and focuses her attentions, both personal and professional, on Crown.  Their affair escalates and vies with the action of the art theft/investigation for the viewers attention.  The tension from both sides of the story continues until the last scene.<br />The style of the film is reminiscent of the original, quick cuts, split screens, rapid pace driven by powerful background music.  Brosnan quickly establishes the character of Crown as powerful, arrogant and wealthy with only a few words of incidental dialogue.  Russo quickly establishes herself as his equal which changes the film from a slick heist film to a romance.  The cinematography is breath takingly beautiful and is backed by a lush music score.<br />The DVD includes both wide-screen and standard formats, English and French subtitles and dubbing, and trailers from both the '68 and '99 versions.  There is also an audio commentary that brings even more to the film.  <br />This is definitely a DVD that is worth buying (as opposed to renting) it is one of those films that merits watching again and again, though it is not one for family watching as it is very definitely and deservedly an R rated film.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Yes, I bought it, enjoyed it, and recognize that I've been suckered. But unlike a good many of my fellow Amazon customers, I find it hard to get too hot and bothered about this latest bit of stealth merchandising by Macca. The tres moderne digital sound is a plus when it comes to \\"Two of Us,\\" \\"For You Blue,\\" and several other cuts. As for \\"The Long and Winding Road\\"--c'mon, folks, it's a piece of schmaltz to begin with, and so is \\"Let It Be\\" (with an extra dose of Mariolatry). It's top-quality schmaltz, I should say, written by a real pro. But when you lean too hard on stuff like this--which is what Phil Spector did when he added the choirs and strings--it turns into something worse: kitsch. So I prefer the stripped-down versions. A pox, however, on the crappy second disk, and on inserting an inferior version of \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and on the general miserliness of the whole package, which should have included a second disk of outtakes and discards.
B00005JMGC|2.0|Okay, so in most movies that strive for enlightenment, they spend the whole movie conveying why this character is so amazing (i.e. Erin Brockovich). In this movie, there exists only one scene to prove to the audience how great this woman is. What about the rest of the movie? Boring.....All those good names, and it made me feel no emotion towards anyone at the end. Usually when I see movies, I feel different at the end, but when i saw this one I was like \\"okay, now what?\\" Should have had many different levels with this character. I was VERY disappointed. Two stars because Maggie G did a great job.
B00005JL3A|2.0|The directer Paul Anderson (MK/ Soldier/ Event Horrizon/) said this in the Making Of RE on the DVD. The question I have is, at what point in this movie does he &quot;hold true to the Video Game&quot;? Who the heck is this &quot;Alice&quot; person? Where is the mansion? Where are the S.T.A.R.S.? Where is the Tyrant? Where is the music? Where is the &quot;world of survival horror? This movie is everything the VG is not. Which is exactly why I gave it two generous stars. People say, &quot;you can't expect the same thing, you can't expect all the puzzles and gadgets, you can't expect the same characters. Huh? What's that? Why call it Resident Evil? Paul Anderson has done great in the past, Mortal Kombat is a peach of flick if you ask me, and Event Horrizon was more scary than this and it was Sci-Fi. I don't get it either. <br />Paul, I know your a big director and I'm one of the little angry viewers that didn't &quot;get it&quot;, but take some advice. Whenever you adapt something, be it a book or a video game, the idea is to truly stay true to the original by re-creating that atmosphere that made us jump at the zombies and the dogs crashing through those windows. The erie music that played over the vast rooms of the mansion and basements. The darkness that followed you everywhere. You did a good job with MK and I respect you for that. But I can't forgive you for what you did to a classic game and genre of Resident Evil. <br />Paul is now at the helm of Aliens Vs. Predator coming out later this year. I'll cross my fingers.
B00004W52U|5.0|Thia is truy an inspirational album, one of my personal favorites, its what got me started on the punk scene. It's 27 tracks of raw energy, amazing lyrics and it makes you wanna skank for hours after listenin to it. Operation Ivy started influenced many bands today with their unique ska punk sound. This is the type of album you can listen to all the way through, each song is as good as the next. If you're a Rancid fan then definately pick this up. It's Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman like you've never heard them before. Its a definate 5 outta 5, it compares to the ramones, the misfits, the clash, NOFX, any of the greatest punk bands.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|This is incredible. When I rented this from Movie Gallery, I just wanted to make a copy of it at a cheap price. I thought I could get the movie without spending $12.99 but this is something you don't just copy. If you want top quality action, get it on the original DVD. Kate Beckinsale delivers blood rippling action and she looks good while doing it. She could even beat Trinity (from the Matrix) in any contest.<br />When you see the movie, it looks like they are building up to a sequal. Just pay attention in the last 12 minutes of this. Better yet, watch it uninterrupted and enjoy it.
B000055X3U|5.0|There is so much sadness that resonates from this album, from the melancholy lyrics to the piercing and emotive guitars, that it echoes in my mind for days afterward.  I keep returning for more with the knowledge that something special is about to unfold.  While there is an obvious Pink Floyd influence here, it only adds to sustain the mood, to lift the songs high into the cold sky.  &quot;Emotional Winter&quot; is both beautiful and saddening, while &quot;Judgement&quot; builds to a grand crescendo and ends abruptly, magnificently.  While there are no songs here to invoke happiness, the bliss one feels from merely encountering such emotional music is fulfilling.  I highly recommend this album for those who enjoy melancholy mixed with fluid songcraft.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I quite enjoyed a number of songs on this CD, and it may be a good place to start, but trust me, its a total waste of money. Many mediocre at best songs were on the album just because they were their most famous song, and some of their greatest songs such as a day in the life and Strawberry fields are not on this CD. Id reccomend pretty much any beatles album over this one.
B000084T18|1.0|Oh my God this is filled with complete garbage. Just a bunch of pop culture phrases and made up nonsense words in rhyme, whenever two quarters here talks about guns it just makes you think about committing suicide. It is really sad when this album makes mc hammer, vanilla ice, marky mark, millie vanillie, and even N sync look like gods.<br />If you listen to it you may lose so many IQ points that you make Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton look smart!
B0000E2FLC|5.0|No matter how many times you watch this DVD, it never gets old. I am a huge AC/DC fan, and my stamp of approval goes out to this DVD. I only wish that I had been there at the Donnington Castle when this concert actually happened. The concert has a great lineup. However, I was very upset to hear the band's version of &quot;The Jack&quot; from when Brian Johnson was the singer instead of Bon Scott's version. This is mostly due to the fact that I had never heard the newer version, and was quite suprised when all the words I was singing didn't match that of the DVD's at all. Not only is the main attraction great, but the extras include many features. For example, Angus and Malcolm have their own commentaries for EVERY album ever put together. Well, all I can say is BUY THIS DVD. I'm off to go watch it again.
B000002UDB|5.0|Classic, the Beatles at the height of their songwriting and creativity
078681859X|5.0|It was great. I couldn't stop reading it because of the plot and detail that he puts in. Also, the way that he switches points of view was terrific. I really liked the little blurbs on the bottom that made me laugh. It was great how the back cover told you a little and alot about the plot and character without acctuallt telling you. The characters involed made me think that they were acctually there from the detail and the way the the main characters related to them during the story.You should definitly read this book if you haven't already.
B0000024JA|4.0|After the phenomenal \\"Enter the Wu Tang: 36 Chambers\\" was released, the next goal of the clan was to get the members on individually, and Meth was first out of the gate. Being the first post \\"Enter the Wu\\" release, this album does not disapoint. It is Rza as a producer, and Meth has an Emcee, in their rawest and ruggedest form. The beats on this album touch all different types of sounds with the rawness attached to it, and the final result was a bizarre twist of dark funk and strange noises which flow with Meth's signature raspy voice and style. Though it wouldn't be terrible if the album was filled with the whole clan making guest appearences, it is perhaps better you only get a few, making this mostly a Meth + Rza production, both in top form.<br />Perhaps the albums difining moment is on \\"Bring the Pain\\", the simple humming with the signature Rza cords make it an excellent beat allowing Meth to spit fire over the track. This is Meth in top-top form where it is more apparent he is a gifted lyracist and not just a blazed out rapper who has a unique style. Although it was mentioned there are only a few collabo's, one of the best tag team/square off Wu records is on here which showcases the groups two most popular members, Meth and Raekwon on \\"Meth vs. Chef\\". The two emcees square off in a semi battle rap where both are able to display their different styles and different techniques of word play.<br />Another one of the top tracks on the album is the \\"All I Need\\" which would be a scary \\"love\\" song for any other rap act to touch. It is not a pianoed out love ballad with an R&B chorus, it is one of the most raw songs on the entire album due to it's daring beat from Rza. More famous for it's remix featuring Mary J Blige, the original is obviously more for the hardcore fans and I find it to be amazing for it's rawness and creativity. <br />There are funky parts of \\"Tical\\" however and I find them to be two of my favorite on the album, and possibly two of my favorite all time Wu records. \\"Release Yo Delf\\" starts of with a modernized and ghetto version of \\"I Will Survive\\", the goes into the semi funkiness and reved up trumpet drawn Rza beat. An instant pump up joint with loud lyrics and a screaming chorus. The funkiest song on the album is \\"P.L.O. Style\\" which another insane tracks. A horn sounding instrument chimes in from time to time and the flow over the track is laid back which makes it more of an easy listen, but not to easy, enough to keep it raw.<br />This album in the end goes just south under the 5 star rating, probably due to a couple of tracks being a little too out there. However, the album is one of my personal favorites and easily one of the best Wu joints of all time. Rza in top form, Meth in top form, that is a ridiculous combination and it shows on this records. Maybe one of the best producer/rapper tandoms in all of hip hop. \\"Tical\\" is definately an insane record with a raw funk unseen today.
B000001BZT|2.0|Title track is great, on the whole though the songs are pretty weak.
B0000931QA|4.0|Okay, so I'd probably give this 4.5 stars, but anyways, this album is great.  It's kind of a cross between Iron Maiden and Dream Theater, and little more commercial as well.  The story of the album is great, creating a good story and it's easy to see what's going on as well (unlike Iron Maiden's 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son', still a great album though).  Some songs have great parts in it, and then some not so great parts, but anyways.<BR>1, 2, 10, 13 and 14 are all short instrumentals/some talking.<br />3. Revolution Calling: An almost perfect song, with a great riff after the intro, and Geoff Tate's strong lyrics also as well.  A good mid paced rocker.<BR>Rating: A<br />4. Operation: Mindcrime: The title track is pretty good as well, with the great chorus.  The verse may be lacking a little bit, but that doesn't take away too much from the song.<BR>Rating: B<br />5. Speak: The intro is an absolutely spectacular riff, the best on the album.  The verse is also great with a good and an awesome vocal melody as well.  The chorus is good, but the part with 'speak the word...' is not very good at all in my opinion.  The beginning of the solo is great as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />6. Spreading the Disease: A solid, standard rock song.  Nothing wrong here.<BR>Rating: B+<br />7. The Mission: In my opinion, the masterpiece of the album.  Starts off with a great soft verse, and then the heavy verse comes in.  This song is packed with emotion everywhere, and should not be missed.<BR>Rating: A+<br />8: Suite Sister Mary: This being the longest song on the album, with many soft and heavy parts.  I personally dislike the soft parts, but the heavier parts are great.<BR>Rating: C+<br />9. The Needle Lies: This one almost feels like a filler, but it is still a great song.  A nice riff, good lyrics, good beat, good everything.<BR>Rating: B+<br />11. Breaking the Silence: A good song with a great whole intro section, but the verse really seems to annoy me.  The chorus is great, though.<BR>Rating: B<br />12. I Don't Believe in Love: Another good intro, but the chorus seems somewhat too commercial for me.  A solid rocker, nothing bad.<BR>Rating: B<br />15. After the slow, soft beginning, the song breaks into an absolutely amazing riff with really captivates the entire song.  The chorus is great as usual, and the verse seems better as well.<BR>Rating: A-
B000002J1H|5.0|This is possibly my favorite album of all time. The opening track gives me chills each time, as a musician I appreciate the complexity of the chord changes. It's simply genius. \\"Awaken\\" and \\"Parallels\\" are also amazing tracks, and the entire album is incomparable. The emotion Jon Anderson pours into his vocals on this LP is amazing. Prog-rock at its best.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Michael Jackson is still #1 to a lot of music lovers, and \\"NUMBER ONES\\" quickly shows you why! His vocal versatility and unique creativity cannot be denied. This CD has something for everyone, and \\"One More Chance\\" is at the top of the list. Jackson faves like \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Black or White,\\" \\"You Are Not Alone,\\" \\"The Earth Song,\\" and \\"You Rock My World\\" are also included for good measure, and this Michael Jackson effort may be one of his very best yet. Buy it; you'll be glad you did!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I like this movie, It was really good for those who could understand it. But I would like to say one thing to the jack#ss Eric T Miller who just wrote that review about everyone who likes this movie being losers. Listen dude, keep your idiot comments to yourself. If you have nothing better than to write a review of a movie you hate, then don't make fun of everyone else. It's a stupid generalization that everyone who likes this movie is a glasses wearing acne faced nerd. By the way, the fact that you go out of the way to say that you have a great dating life kind of makes me think you have none at all. Dumba##.
0811821846|5.0|This beautifully illustrated, spiral-bound, hardcover book is a must buy for any serious Star Wars fan who wants to add a touch of The Force to his or her life with the delicious recipes featured in it.  The book is divided into five sections for easy reference: Breakfasts, Beverages, Snacks and Sides, Main Courses and Desserts. Each Star Wars themed recipe is fully and clearly explained (ingredient measurements and preparation instructions) for easy understanding. The book also comes with a few foil stickers for storage and gift labeling and an introduction that contains practical advise on cooking safety and a guide of the cooking tools you'll need. As an added bonus, the pages of the book are laminated for easy, stain-free cleaning.  You will love all the recipes, and will probably recreate, the wonderfully photographed serving suggestions given in the book like the Han-Burgers, Crazy Cantina Chili and the Jabba Jiggle, which are decorated with the action figures of known characters of the original Star Wars movie trilogy. Other recipes' presentations feature enjoyable visual puns like the TIE Fighter Ties, the Twin Sun Toast and the R2-D2 Treats. Some are even very basic, but really tasty, recipes that have been given clever Star Wars-sounding names like Oola-la French Toast, Hoth Chocolate, Yoda Soda and Boba Fett-uccine.  Buy this book, and share the joy of cooking and your love of everything Star Wars with kids and adults, family and friends. And May The Force Be With You.  I would also recommend buying the Star Wars Cookbook II and The Star Wars Party Book along with this one as they all make a complete, excellent and fun idea source book for everyday cooking and Star Wars themed parties.  --Reviewed by M. E. Volmar
B0000VCZKM|3.0|I think that the people who originally produced this wonderful movie deserve more respect for their effort. And the public in general deserve more respect for the money they spend in fakes like this. I bag to companies that produce DVDs with art like this one to use WIDE SCREEN formats with the best technology possible. In my opinion, it is a matter of justice and honesty. After all we are already well in the 21st century, (except, perhaps, in the minds of some people for whom &quot;money&quot; is the only art they know).
B00008DDSC|4.0|Secretary is indeed an oddity.  A watchable engaging one, but nevertheless an oddity.<br />I suppose Steven Shainberg has taken a difficult subject and humanized it quite nicely.  Lee Holloway, played deftly by Maggie Gyllenhaal, has a self-deprecating personality that she takes out upon herself in careful sharp and cutting means.  It doesn't seem too healthy and may be disturbing by the general Joe and Jill Q. Public to watch.  E. Edward Grey, also well-played, by James Spader, is a neat-freak lawyer that seems equally isolated and disturbed.  Just about all the characters in this flick (and they aren't many), have issues of the emotional kind.<br />Though it might not be a film for everyone, in the end we know the twisted people and oddly enough find them human wanting in the needs that all human want, connection, meaning, compassion.  It is odd that it comes to this.<br />Don't miss the belly-aching laugh of Gyllenhaal's character attempting to delve into the world of S&amp;M by throwing tomatoes at a furtive and bound soul (bound to a oven no less).  It is a hoot.<br />If your squeamish or your taste are on the slightly prude side, steer clear of Secretary.  If not, and you possess an open-mind, by all means give Secretary a watch.  You will find it less about S&amp;M and more about a character study of the human condition.<br />-MMW
B0000AZT72|4.0|This is a great movie for those who want to have a mind-numbing moment with soccer, special effects, good humour, and why not, man's greatest invention: football!
0465011020|4.0|I had the chance to meet with the author, Kang Chol Hwan, this past summer in Seoul. Having spent ten years in a gulag for a crime his grandfather committed, he is among the lucky ones who survived. He took the risk and escaped because he felt it was his only option. In North Korea, political oppression is so severe that entire bloodlines, (normally two generations or more), are thrown in labor camps if one member is accused of \\"disloyalty\\" toward the regime. Kang's book is full of powerful images. The eyewitness account brings a detailed accuracy to a dark world unimaginable to those who haven't experienced it for themselves. Kang emphasized during our interview that every incident mentioned in his book was true and free of exaggeration. Kang, now a reporter for the Chosun Daily, continues to write editorial pieces about the atrocious human rights situation in the North.
B00018D3RI|4.0|The first season of Starsky and Hutch was the best one.  This season had incorporated some humor (in the form of Huggy Bear) and was a fair buddy-cop show.  Later seasons lost the humor and the stars both wanted to not be buddy-buddy, and so the show developed into something less than what it was originally.<br />In any case, the first season DVD is something worth purchasing and has my recommendation.
B000002I99|5.0|After the release of 1973's Billion Dollar Babies, most were inclined to think Alice Cooper group would never top it. They were arguably correct since A.C. spit up in '74 (The Alice Cooper band had trouble since Alice was not getting up for rehearsals and his anger and drinking had gotten out of hand), but that doesn't mean Alice couldn't come darn close again through his first ambitious solo debut. Initially, one would not compare the signatures of a group and solo career but with 1975's \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\", Alice Cooper preserved the same garage style sound which accomodated his recently broken group. This was a good thing though, for fans of Blue Oyster Cult, Kiss, and Ted Nugent since Alice retained the same punkish-rock of the early 70's. The same comparisons may be concluded with Phil Collins' solo career versus the sound of Genesis or Tom Petty's solo career versus the sound of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.<br />Alice keeps his reliable producer Bob Ezrin on board for the voyage and a strange, yet fun one it is since it is jammed with some horrific sound effects. The basis is on a a nasty dream alice can't escape (though one may assume you can't solidify a theme on something so ficticious as a nightmare). It works whether you believe it or not. The title track opens with a horror-laced, fantasy-paved invitation into Alice's alchoholic-post psychedelic (and moderately horrific) atmosphere.<br />\\"Devil's Food\\" is a highlighted track with vincent price as a guest dicussing the ironically pleasurable danger's of venomous spider. Price would also come to guest for the title track of Michael Jackson's 1982 hit Thriller.<br />\\"Cold Ethyl\\" is a driving track where the ethyl is metaphorically a women (more specifically-audio clips from a pleasured women) and Alice discusses the not-so-hidden  alchoholic demons which haunted him until 1986's \\"Constrictor\\".<br />\\"Only women Bleed\\" is a sad ballad, but a memorable track which really has more to do Alice's self-blame for not attending to his girlfriend and soon-to-be-wife when he suffered from alchoholism.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I've always loved Nickelback since I picked up their album Curb and everything they've done since then is amazing so I knew I would love this album. Chads voice is so amazing and can honestly cut through you when you listen to his lyrics.  I can safely say that these 4 guys sound as great as Alice In Chains did on all their cds.
0767805712|4.0|I was in 8th grade when this film was released. I went to the movies often as that was the only thing I could do then. I watched Gattaca thinking it was  some sci-fi action film but in the end I was dissappointed to see it wasn't, as were my friends who watched. My teacher loved it and i teased her how much it sucked. I eventually wrote a review for it for my school newspaper, although personally i thought it was ok, i expected something else. Years later, I felt compelled to watch it again and being a little older and mature, I really enjoyed it. My only dissappointment was that it ended. I would've liked to see more interaction between the two brothers but overall the tone of the movie is both dark and hopeful. Eugene burning himself at the end was very chilling indeed and everything works so well in the movie. The love aspect was very well done, although it was like how did these 2 hook up again? but both actors performance was soo good it carried it.. they are married in real life. This movie made me think, something i sometimes forget to do.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Evan though I have always loved reading, including fantasy, I had a terrible time reading the Lord Of the Ring series.  Never did finish it, but the movie is wonderful, holds your attention. The photography is wonderful. the characters are so believable, and I find everyone one in our family that has seen it loved it. From the grandmother to the 7 year old grandson, and every age group in between.   Wish we had more like this.
0385504209|2.0|Maybe after hearing so much about this book, I'd set my expectations too high. But upon finishing this remarkably mediocre book, I couldn't help but scratch my head and wonder how in the hell this &quot;novel&quot; continues to top the best-sellers list. As others have mentioned, this clunker reads as if the author is absolutely itching to sign on for the movie. The chapters are so short, you wonder if the target audience has A.D.D.<br />The concepts are interesting, yes...but the prose is jerky, the characters remarkably flat and completely unengaging. All Dan Brown has done is find an absorbing topic and convert it into what is ultimately a very lame &quot;thriller.&quot; I never have been impressed with the genre; thrillers are for those who don't have the capacity to appreciate REAL literature.<br />Don't waste your time on this book. Even a common idiot could figure out the &quot;clues&quot; that our supposedly &quot;genius&quot; characters puzzle over like dumb dogs for chapters. Examples: wow, could the ten-digit code to the vault possibly be the ten numbers Grandpa wrote on the floor in his dying moments? Could the password to the cryptex possibly be - gasp! - his granddaughter's name? And honestly, what moron wouldn't recognize Leonardo Da Vinci's famous backwards handwriting? I thought these characters were supposed to be SMART.<br />Bottom line: skip it. You're not missing much.
B00009TB5G|2.0|Peter Jackson's &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is a film adaptation of the second volume of Tolkien's classic fantasy masterpiece by the same name.  As in the first film in this series, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, it's an excellent swords and sorcery flick, featuring even more combat - everything from one on one fistfights to battle scenes of 10,000, all using the best in live action and realistic computer graphics animation.<br />For those who truly love the books, though, the movie may fall short.  As in &quot;Fellowship&quot;, not enough time is spent on characterization, leaving many of the characters one or two dimensional; in some cases they bear only a superficial resemblance to their namesakes from the book.  In addition, one of Jackson's departures from Tolkien - presentation of Saruman as a mere minion of the evil Sauron, rather than as a would be competitor - grows from a minor annoyance in &quot;Fellowship&quot; to a major failing in &quot;Towers&quot;, as it's the suppressed rivalry between Sauron and Saruman that drives much of the plot in this portion of the original novel.  As a result of this departure, for example, the orcs' conflict over where to take the captive Merry and Pippin in the original book is reduced to an argument over food, and one is left wondering why the bad guys fail to coordinate their attacks on Gondor and Rohan, rather than understanding that the uncoordinated timing results from differing goals.<br />Unlike the special edition of &quot;Fellowship&quot;, the extended version of &quot;Towers&quot; does little to ameliorate these flaws; while the added scenes do tend to focus on characterization, Theoden still comes across as craven and Treebeard as hasty, contrary to the books.  Some of the added scenes, particularly the ones with Merry and Pippin, are quite humorous, though.<br />Note that there doesn't seem to be a way to view the shorter theatrical cut from this set of DVDs, so if you're primarily interested in fight scenes and don't care too much about Tolkien, you might want to stick with one of the other editions. If you're interested in more than fighting and patient enough to watch for four hours, this edition may be the one to get; if you're a Tolkien fan, the excellent packaging of this edition will make it look much better on the bookshelf, which is where these DVDs will spend most of their time.ly interested in fight scenes and don't care too much about Tolkien, you might want to stick with one of the other editions.

B000060P79|4.0|I enjoyed it.Wow people are very touchy on here. They get upset at people for liking something they hate. What one person may relate to or enjoy listening to may be very different from the next person, it's common. Don't get your feelings hurt because someone connects with an artist in a way that you don't. All you true-to-your-genre fanatics who get so worked up about what is or isn't punk or whatever, please, get over yourselves. Music is about what makes you feel good, what you can relate to and what gets you, who cares what it's label is..you &quot;punk&quot; fans aren't supposed to be into labeling anyway right? Well I enjoy the CD, it's fun to listen to, not one of the more profound Albums I own but it's nice when the mood is right. Good Stuff.
B000002P5W|5.0|I'm not quite sure exactly what the axis is, all I know is that this album provides more stylishness than you can shake a stick at. No one can be called a Hendrix fan if they don't own this album. It is a pure masterpiece!<BR>It is superb from start to finish and what a front cover, Amazing.<br />There may be 13 tracks, but only 12 are actual songs. Track 1, `EXP' is a radio station announcement by which Mitch Mitchell; the radio announcer is interviewing a very unusual character, voiced by Hendrix. It is a very funny and weird experiment, but it does used Hendrix's love for sci-fi fantasy to inject a stifling sound into our ears.<br />Track 2, `Up From The Skies' is a tremendous jazzy, funky pick up with flashy brushwork from Mitchell. Psychedelic splendour is found in songs such as `If 6 Was 9', Redding's `She's So Fine' and `You Got Me Floatin'. Though I would class the whole album as psychedelic, there is more psychedelica in certain songs than others. The use or texture that Hendrix's guitar produces helps lift the tracks from typical rock to ultra groovy 60's mantra. Most of these songs are below the three minute radio air play limit, all but three songs, `If 6 was 9', `Bold as Love' and `One Rainy Wish'. My view is that these tracks deserve to be a little longer, because the songs get better and better towards the end, as the title track demonstrates. The use technology makes it sound as though Hendrix is playing under water, which was what he dreamt about and managed to produce that sound which totally shakes the walls.<BR>Elements of funk are found in `Little Miss Lover' and `Ain't No Telling', with their fast, rock and roll pace. Uplifting music.   <br />`Little Wing' is soft and delicate with the very complex intro and smooth lyrics taking over your body and soul. `Castles made Of Sand' also demonstrates Hendrix's fancy fretwork and it's smooth, lulling texture. No one could ever write a ballad as well as good old Jimi. <BR>Not as long as Are You Experienced or Electric Ladyland, but none the less, this album provides enough power to send your head revving with sound and diversity.<br />One word to describe this album, outstanding! I'm sure I have said enough. Enjoy!
B000056JYC|2.0|THANKS PETER FOR THIS GREAT MASTERPIECE. I HAD TOO RATE IT 2. BECAUSE OF THEM USEING THE HDCD. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE DECODER ON YOUR EQUITMENT TO HEAR THE TRUE SOUND. ALSO I NOTICED SOME DROP OUTS IN THE RECORDING. THE BEST WAY TO GO IS GET THE MFSL RECORDING. NO DROP OUTS. SHARP CRISP SOUND. I HOPE THIS REVIEW HELPED.
B000002O3I|5.0|This disc, which is a compilation of two early Howlin Wolf albums minus one track, I believe, is one of those seminal precursors to the music of the next four and a half decades (and counting). It's got that raw edge that's missing from so much of the music that followed it, and a depth and power that's frightening at times. Really, this is one-in-a-million stuff that might scare you. If you really dig on this kind of sound, you might enjoy &quot;Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot&quot; by Captain Beefheart, who picked up on this eccentric electric blues thread and ran with it past the endzone and out into the street.  Tom Waits also has this feel in his bluesier material. But this will never be topped.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Everyone seems to have their own idea of what should have been included on this compilation - and everyone seems to have different choices - so maybe they got it right - as theres no pleasing everyone. But for what its worth, if I could change it I would:<br />Chop out all of the rubbish that came out after The Floyd stopped operating as a 4 piece (before Waters ego went into overdrive aka circa The Wall and the Gilmour (aka George Melly)  led pipe and slippers drone filled the last 2 efforts)<br />And replace with: Interstellar Overdrive / Careful with that Axe Eugene / Cirrus Minor / Fat Old Sun / and maybe Dogs (You gotta be Crazy!) - and they could have bunged Brain Damage on with the brill Gilmour solos featured on Live at Pompeii included ontop<br />So there we go - but I still like it for what it is
B000002UJQ|5.0|Can only reinforce your review,OK computer SUPERB album, Radiohead one of best bands for a long time,and'let down' I play time and time again and never tire of it,DEFINATELY one of the best songs ever written,Julie,Carlisle,Cumbria,UK.
1400049628|5.0|I picked up this book expected to chuckle. I thoght it would be along the lines of the Worse Case books. It starts out with that droll, almost English tounge in cheek humor and rapidly gets serious. It's obvious Max Brooks did some research. Everything you ever wanted to know about zombie lore plus a dollop of human history and nature is thrown in. <br />The first half of the book talks about dealing with a class 1 through 4 zombie outbreak and offers advice such as don't go down in the basement, don't go to the hospital--there's dead and dying folks there to begin with, keep moving, don't let the zombie get close enough to touch you, and keep quiet until you reach safety. <br />The second half describes recorded attacks from ancient time until today and it's actually scary. If Max Brooks ever decides to write straight horror fiction I'll buy it. The story about the slave ship full of zombies gave me genuine chills. <br />Another very amusing and clever touch is the way Brooks never breaks away from the tone of the book. The dedication, introduction, about the author page and acknowlegement pages all <BR>stick to the book's theme. All in all, I'm delighted with this book. It's funny and scary and that is very difficult to pull off. Head to your secure location, turn the lights down, turn the radio off and read this little thriller.  Max Brooks, take a bow!
B0000X61UU|5.0|i have done alot of workout vidoes and this is still my all time favorite dispite the fact that it is older than most videos i own.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|After watching Kill Bill I had to have the soundtrack. It is near perfect. With a couple of exceptions listening to each song recreated the movie in my mind and it made me curious about the artists. After hearing Nancy Sinatra doing Bang Bang (her's was better than the Cher version) I went out and bought more of her stuff. After hearing the amazing Green Hornet solo by Al Hirt--it actually sounds like an angry hornet on the move--I ordered a CD of his greatest hits. Santa Esmerelda is fantantastic doing Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. Lonely Shepard, Flower of Carnage and Grand Duel are incredible. <br />There is however, one heaping pile of ...mistake on this album. The RZA cut stinks. It wasn't in the movie, has lousy lyrics,(As a reviewer pointed out earlier how can Oren be HALF Japanese, HALF Chinese and HALF American? Somebody flunked third grade math.) And it doesn't seem to go with the rest of the album. Also the \\"bonus\\" FX tracks seemed like filler. Otherwise this is just so great.

0671799320|5.0|This book is no doubt a great book, and the most comprehensive history of the oil industry.  I hope the author updates the book every 25 years or so because once again this industry is going through another cycle.  Also a lot of previously classified documents are becoming publicly available such as in 2004 the British released papers stating Nixon was willing to occupy OPEC oil fields with military force because of their embargo.<BR>    But the book does have faults mainly with Daniel Yergin put way to many of his opinions in this book (maybe that is inevitable).  For example he says in the Epiloge that Iraqi soldiers commits certain crimes while in Kuwait, that information is know known to be completly wrong, so i hope the next printing of this book updates that.  Also he says that Saddam Hussein had ambitions for Arab-conquest, maybe he is right but i feel his opinion is wrong...it would have been nice if he said that was his opinion, and another possible ansewer excists for him trieng to take over Iran and Kuwait.<BR>   Also this book does a great job of telling the story of Saudi, Iran, and Venezuala.  But much is desired with Iraq, Libya, the North Sea, and Nigeria.<BR>   Maybe i am demanding too much from this book, it is already a 800+ page book.<BR>   I found the best way to complete it is: read one chapter a day, so you will finish it in about a month....it takes disipline but it worked for me.<BR>   This is a must read, everyone in high school or college should be required to read this book.
1573226521|2.0|Alex Garland has plenty of talent, but for some reason he couldn't finish the book the way it started. The creative flow  ran out of fuel when Richard found the beach.(Advice, That would be the ideal spot to move onto another book.) If you are interested in fishing and gardening, then continue with the last half. Basically the book turns into lord of the flies in the last chapter. It even has a the same story plot as Treasure Island in the begining, it makes me wonder sometimes.  I still can't believe it was made into a movie!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I've adored Josh Groban's rich tenor voice from the first time I heard it a few years back. I was floored by his first record, and on \\"Closer\\", the singer is back - and better than ever. <br />It's obvious that Josh has matured over the last few years, and the inclusion of so many Italian - language pieces are a testament to his growth. Hearing the beautifully - pronounced lyrics only adds richness to the deepness found on English - language songs.<br />Every track on this record is amazing, but some simply deserve spotlight recognition. In no particular order:<br />'All Improvviso Amore': This is easily my favorite piece on the album. It is both fiesty and uplifting, and brings to mind images of ships on the high seas. There is a vitality and rawness to the song, yet it is still gentle.<br />'My Confession': Reminiscent of a Spanish love song, 'My Confession' is heartfelt, passionate, and even sensual in its lyrics and message. Josh's tender vocals only add to the emotion.<br />'Oceano': The first track on the record, 'Oceano' makes Josh's maturity immediately recognizable. His comfort and fluency with the Italian language is evident here, as is the power his voice has.<br />'Remember When It Rained': Written by Josh, it is a heart - breaking song of love lost. This one may well be his next big hit, as it is tender, soft, and so beautiful it's nearly painful.<br />'You Raise Me Up': His current radio hit, 'You Raise Me Up' is a beautiful cross between southern gospel and Irish mysticism. It is a warm song detailing the greatest of all relationships.<br />As amazing as his debut album was, Josh Groban has outdone himself with \\"Closer\\". It is a record that will go down as one of the best ever made, full of beauty, passion, and a tremendous voice.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I don't realy have much to say about this cd, it's the best rap cd ever if you like that stuff, my personal fav. is The way I am. Because it rocks and Marilyn Manson appears on the video wich makes the song 100x better and it was good to start with. Eminems best work ever.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|From the first time I heard Gavin DeGraw on the radio, I was mesmerized.  I have seen him in concert twice now and both times I have been totally blown away.  He caught my attention as a singer and songwriter because not only does he have so much range and control with his smooth, sultry voice, but he also writes every bit of his great lyrics and he can play the piano and guitar like nobody's business.  I would recommend this CD a thousand times over because it's something I can put in the CD player and it never gets old.  If you enjoy it half as much as I do, your ten dollars will have been well spent.

It's campy, for sure, and a bit dated now, but the actors did such a fine job you can totally get drawn into the story- and that is really all that matters.<br />No one believes Charlie Brewster when he states that the neighbor is a vampire- and believe me, Charlie, the goofy high school student, has tried everything: telling his friends, his mom, and even the police. Unfortunately, Mr. Dandridge, the vampire, is extremely charming and everyone is so taken with him-even poor Charlie's girlfriend- that they think Charlie needs to stop watching horror films and get a life.<br />When he manages to get the  washed up and cowardly horror film actor who hosts his favorite show (&quot;Fright Night&quot;- the snippets shown of the fictional TV show are hilarious) involved things really start cracking...and it's about time, because Dandridge is intent on winning the popularity contest; he tranforms buddy Evil into his minion, and next on the list is girlfriend Amy. It's up to bumbling Charlie and his Hollywood buddy to save the day...and it's no easy task given that no one under Dandridge's spell wants to be saved...<br />Given how seductive Chris Sarandon was in this, I wouldn't have wanted to be saved either...In Amy's own words: He's really &quot;NEAT!&quot;<br />For vampy fun with camp and humor, but with some sophisticated effects, this movie is a good watch.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a excellant DVD, something like two hours of Shania Twain at her best, her counrty /pop style of music along with her charismatic stage presence, makes this DVD and concert a must have for any Shania Twain fan.  22 preformances along with some fan interaction surprizes, make the two hour or so show<BR>very entertaining.  Old Shania to new Shania you get it all here<BR>in a way that only Shaina can deliver it.<BR>I saw the &quot;UP&quot; tour here in St.Louis, it was in the round, this concert is on a large stage, so it will slightly different form<BR>the offical tour, but a awesome concert none the less.<BR>I highly recommend this entertaining DVD.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|Bryan Singer is to be credited for turning out a sequel every bit as good and in some ways better than the original.  Without recapitulating the involved plot, suffice to say, there's a lot of action, some great special effects and superb acting.<br />Famke Janssen - continues to solidify her acting chops as Jean.  After twenty some films, Ms. Janssen is a strong focus of this film and pulls it off quite well, especially in the finale.<br />James Marsden - Cyclops isn't used a lot in this film, which is a shame.  He too is showing some depth and growth in his portrayal.<br />Alan Cummings - Night Crawler--what a great addition.  A super hero who says the rosary and the Lord's Prayer?  Quite unique and refreshing.<br />Halle Berry - Oscar winner continues to show there's nothing wrong with continuing in the series in a &quot;lesser&quot; role.  She's good and it's too bad she's not coming back for more.  After &quot;Gothika,&quot; though who knows?<br />Brian Cox as the villainous Stryker is commanding and quite despicable as the man out to rid the world of all mutants.<br />Shawn Ashmore as Bobby, the iceman is also a talented young man, whom we should be seeing more of.<br />Rebecca Stamos as Mystique is given more time in this one and does a commendable job too.<br />Hugh Jackman - a strong leading man type even with the weird hairdo.  This man is showing his versatility both on screen and stage.<br />Now, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great actors; they just seem so wooden and disinterested at times.  Enliven them a bit!<br />Cotter Smith as the President does a very good job too in a rather thankless role.  Remember him from a lot of B-movies of the eighties and nineties.<br />This is an action-packed, entertaining movie!<br />RECOMMENDED.
B00005JM02|4.0|I would give this movie 5 stars because the animation was awesome, but I have learned to expect nothing but the best from Pixar.  Instead, I gave it 4 stars because the storyline, although interesting, was just missing something.  I didn't like this nearly as much as Monsters, Inc.  Ellen Degeneres as Dori the fish, was perfect.  There is also a jelly fish scene, where I learned something about them I never knew before.<br />Admittedly, I probably would have liked this more too if it hadn't had the typical Disney opening trauma of having something/someone die, and then building a story/moral around that.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Yes, Adrian's acting was a bit dry in this film, but maybe that was Wladyslaw Szpilman for you.  The movie is about him, and if his demeanor was that way so be it; but no one can deny that the ordeal and pain this man endured for approximately 5 years of his life is not intriguing and worthy of a film.  This person managed to survive the impossible, lost his family, his home, was in the warsaw ghetto (very low survival rate) and managed to escape, his profession and ultimate love (that of the piano) was stripped away from him, and even without these things to keep him going, he SURVIVED?  This movie was amazing, and the fact that it was a true story is absolutely incredible.<br />This film also brings to light the struggles of non-jewish Poles in Nazi occupied territories.  The resistance of the warsaw ghetto and the poles, the Russian army.  It's an excellent movie for history buffs.  I own the DVD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical films.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just saw Schindler's List - Both movies are tied in my book.
B00005JKC3|1.0|I like comics.  I like superhero movies.  I don't like this one.  The story lost control of itself somewhere.  Plot lines were left just dangling in the wind.  And for some reason, the hulk chooses bouncing around as his mode of transportation.  Did he fill up on gummy berry juice?  Great actors were wasted.  And apparently the transition between scenes is more important than the scene itself.  There was a story here, but I don't know what happened to it.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Ever After is the REAL cinderella story, as it would've most likely occured.  Not only is the setting beautiful, and the acting superb, but the script in this film is amazing.  This film is funny, charming, witty and very romantic.  There is drama, comedy, action, romance, betrayal, everything you could ever ask for in a good movie.  You'll have no regrets.
0156027321|5.0|Read this in my wine...er..book club.   All the women enjoyed it but it got some mixed reviews.  Everyone agreed hands down that the first 100 pages were a chore.  My advise is get through those pages because once that ship goes down it's an amazing tale.  Many in the group were wondering where fact left off and fiction began.  All I'll say is - that was kind of the point.  This book at its heart is about the love of story telling.  It's a great book to read and an even better book to discuss with your friends.
B000089CJI|5.0|Some records you own, you call &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;genius&quot; and &quot;important,&quot; and you never ever listen to them.<BR>And then some records, when pressed, you might describe as &quot;pretty good,&quot; or &quot;fun,&quot; or (in this case) &quot;kind of like the guy from Death Cab For Cutie doing Erasure,&quot; and other mild positives--and you listen to those records ALL THE TIME.<br />I was going to give this four stars. Then I decided that I was going to rearrange my opinions based on actual man-hours spent listening to given songs, records and bands. I'm starting with this record. So, five stars it is.

B00003CXB4|5.0|What can I say?  I am a huge Disney fan and especially have always loved this movie and music!  My brother just purchased this for me and I love it!<br />This DVD has adorable extras including two version of the movie.  It has the original released in the theater version along with the version that I saw in the IMAX theater which included a new song, &quot;Morning Report&quot;.  This is a song which was included also in the Broadway version of this story (which if you even just like the Lion King, or love seeing brilliant productions...YOU MUST SEE THE BROADWAY SHOW)  And this DVD gives the behind the scenes, broadway preview to wet everyone's appetite.<br />Also, on the DVD are games like What Character Are you?  which is cute.<br />The story of the Lion King is one that you may have to tell little ones about before they see.  There is a scary part where Simba's father is killed.  When I first saw it in the theaters, my little cousin came with me, she was about 5.  Her mom had talked to her beforehand about what happened and when the music got intense she leaned up and asked, &quot;Did he died yet?&quot;.  She did get scared and I had to put her on my lap for a few minutes, but as the next scene included &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;, she turned to me and said, &quot;I can go back to my seat now.&quot;  With some warning, it is a movie that the young ones will enjoy too.<br />    I can't wait to someday share this DVD with my children and this special edition is a great keepsake.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|I agree that the full screen version otherwise distracts the viewer from what should be a great viewing experience. If there was any value in John Huston directing this movie, it is in the scope of the sets and the dance scences.  In this version, it sometimes looks like some amateur put down their camcorder accidentally leaving it on--like when Molly sings &quot;You're NEver Fully Dressed&quot; there is a shot of the ceiling and you only see Molly out of the lower corner of the screen!  Bizarre, and I hope they come out with a widescreen version.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie was incredible.  Of course, the reviews of our family members is tuly mixed, so while I really loved it, my husband's parents and sister hated it.  Well, each to their own.<br />I had no idea what I was in for and the beginning of the movie has a lot of quick change filmed angles and is very fast paced, I found that I enjoyed it more and more as I watched.  In my opinion the most amazing part of this movie is the creative use of present day pop songs in a musical.  I had to start hysterically laughing when I recognized the characters singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.  It totally fit into the movie and was perfect.  In fact, all of the actors sang beautifully which was a terrific surprise.<br />This is a modern day love story which is beautifully written, delivered, filmed and sung.  In fact, my husband and I have really fallen in love with several songs in the movie and danced the first dance at our wedding to a version of &quot;Come What May&quot; on the Moulin Rouge II Soundtrack.  Many of our guests kept asking what song that was and it really created a beautiful moment for us as husband and wife.<br />I guarantee that if you get this movie, you will either love it or hate it.  I hope you love it as much as I did and can appreciate Baz's genius in this masterpiece.

B00000JLWW|4.0|I haven't made up my mind about this film. This is a 3 1/2 hour long soap opera nevertheless. <br />What I Like<br />-Attention to accurate detail in recreating history<BR>-Special effects (example.. the breath in the cold air)<BR>-The musical score (except Celine Dion's solo)<BR>-The costumes and representing the time period (Gilded/Edwardian/Georgian Age)<BR>-The contrast between the rich and poor, social classes<BR>-&quot;Nearer My God to Thee&quot; and the depth of emotion within those final scenes<BR>-Real and actual footage of the real Titanic<br />What I Hate<br />-The melodrama and the love story<BR>-Celine Dion's solo My Heart Will Go On<BR>-The fact that as a third class passenger, Jack Dawson would never have been allowed on the 1st class decks!<br />Grade B+
B0000BYM3K|5.0|One day, I was at my cousins, when he told me he bought this CD. So we sat down and listened to the whole thing. I was amazed.<br />Previously, Metallica and Linkin Park had been my favorite bands. This CD changed my mind. IRON MAIDEN RULES!!!<br />Now if only I could refund St. Anger...
0064400557|5.0|My first memories of this book are way back when I was too young to read myself,my mother sister and I had just moved out of an abuse family situation and my mother used to read bits of this to us every night before we fell asleep.I've carried this book with me throughout my entire life.It's written beautifully and is soo jam packed with meaning for every age imaginable.Respect all creatures,they all have souls and hearts and minds.I now,am reading this book to the children I teach from time to time and they adore it.I am an animal rights activist and I believe this book truly gives meaning to everything I do.READ IT,BUY IT,GIVE IT AS A GIFT TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!!!
B0000X61VE|5.0|This video has three great workouts.  The music and artistic feel will keep you from getting bored, time after time.  Overall it is a stylish video and a fabulous overall workout.  You will feel it the next day!  Cindy is motivating.  Her 2nd video, The Next Challenge is also highly recommended.  It truly is more of a challenge and continues with the artsy, stylish theme of Shape Your Body.
B0000CFW87|5.0|WOW, I knew his 2nd CD would be great and is it ever.  For years Barbra has been the best singer male or female in the world as far as I'm concerned but I believe Josh's incredible voice is every bit as good.  Every song on this CD is beautiful.  It doesn't matter if you don't understand the languages, you fall in love anyway.  I just envy those who do understand every word!
B00000JNNY|5.0|You know as I listen to this cd, one thing becomes clear. Etta James is raw, real, powerful, strong and to the point. None of today's singers can hold a finger to her. She is of the last great jazz/blues singers. Bessie, Billie, Ella, Sarah, Dinah, and Nina are gone. Only Etta is left....people need to show her more respect. Claps for Xtina for trying to keep Etta's legacy alive by talking about her on interviews and at her concerts. One listen to this gem and you will know why SOME call her &quot;Queen of the Blues&quot;.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Excellent movie! ( I can't praise it enough!!) This is what great movies are for and about.  Filmmaking at its finest; where the intersection of great direction, acting, writing and wonderful story telling through powerful images all meet.  I can't think of anyone but Tim Burton could have made such a wonderful film.  I have never laughed and cried so hard in the same movie before in all my life. I do like Burton's other work, but often find hat it needs to grow on me over time for me to appreciate it.  \\"Beattlejuice\\" is a prime example of this.  However I fell in love with \\"Batman\\" and \\"A Nightmare Before Christmas\\" at first sight.<br />Son \\"William\\" (Billy Crudup) is distant to his father, \\"Edward Bloom\\" (Albert Finney) a man he claims now he never knew. William struggles to figure out Edward whom is now dying of cancer.  Who is (was) he really?  William figures that all the great stories that his father has told him as he was growing up, are nothing more than lies and fabrications and slowly he makes the journey and researches these \\"tall tales\\"; finding the truth among the fiction.  (The similarity in terms of  appearance between the \\"young\\" Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor) and the \\"old\\" Edward (Albert Finney) is astounding!  Kudos to both for their brilliant acting. Finally finding the love in his father's stories among the harsh reality of the world.  For Edward Bloom is (was) the big fish swimming in the even bigger ocean of the world.<br />There are some amazing romantic moments in the film for all of us hopeless romantics.  The love between Edward and his wife (played by Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman) seem so honest, real and true.  The \\"drying out\\" bath tub sequence, the field of daffodils and finally the Big Fish being released in the river of life, sealed with a kiss brought many of tear to my eye.  As son tells a final story for his father, a gift is passed from one generation to the other.<br />I want so bad for this movie to walk away with Oscar gold for there hasn't been a movie which has touched me so touched and moved me so deeply in years. (\\"American Beauty\\" being the last.)  Still I'm afraid the epic \\"Lord of the Rings:  Return of the King\\" will walk way with all this years Oscar gold and justifiably so there hasn't been epic storytelling this good since the \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy.  Still why I realize that \\"The Return of the King\\" (and the other two \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films) are great I can't really say I was moved by them in.  Touched yes, moved no.  Which is just the opposite with \\"Big Fish,\\" I hope that good word of mouth will catch this tall (fantastic) tale some awards, hook line and sinker or shall I say line and wedding ring.gold for there hasn't been a movie which has touched me so touched and moved me so deeply in years.

B000002B1M|5.0|This album proves that he is the best.When listening to this album you can't just listen to the beats you have to listen to the lyrics espescially his song I gave you power, this song not only has a nice beat but the lyrics speak to you.In this song nas acts as if he was a gun and tells his life and paths as a gun and what it felt like to be in the hands of  killers but then at the end realizes that he himself is he killer and not the men  so overall I give this album a 5 because nas not only teaches you about the street but in every song brings you into the street.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love this CD, I listen to it when I do yoga.  It's great... relaxing.  I highly recommend it.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Great! Did leave the plot line of the book a few times, but a beautiful story!!! Excellently done and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. Enough said, this is a fantastic pick for any horse lover or anyone in general at all!
B00005JL2O|3.0|Goldmember is the third in the series of the tales of the legendary Austin Powers-who makes women everywhere swoon despite his apparent ghastly looks, who can crack any mystery, and is the overly-emphasized embodiment of the 1960's hippie-ideals as they appear to the later generations: free love and lots of bright colors for everyone. Albeit one must admit the flamboyant hippish flair of the movies have given way to downright rude and uncouth sex and bathroom jokes. Funny-as-ever British humor? Or well on its way to becoming a worn-out cliché? It's something that depends entirely on the mood and whims of the viewer. For tried-and-true Mike Myers fans, from Wayne's World to Austin Powers and Shrek, Goldmember is a sure laugh. For those who are tired of the same jokes in every movie, as Ozzy Osbourne himself complains, the trademark fun is likely to be a bore.<br />Mr. Powers is out to save the world again in his third box office hit with lots of naughty innuendo. His father, Nigel Powers (Sir Michael Caine), has been kidnapped by Dr. Evil, Austin's arch-enemy. This time Dr. Evil's collaborator is Goldmember, the Dutch maniac who had a tragic smelting accident and thus, metonymically as it must be in Austin Powers, has \\"gilded tallywhackers\\" and his \\"meat and two veg painted goooold\\". Austin Powers is hard-pressed to overcome the traumas created by a bad father-son relationship as he has to discover the whereabouts of his father and rescue the world from another attempt of its destruction. In the end, it turns out that Dr. Evil and Austin are long-lost brethren, and all enmity and animosity between them is forgotten. Scotty (Seth Green), who once opposed his father's world-conquering aims, now declares his father a \\"sissy\\" and begins to show disturbing signs of inheriting the Evil-associated traits, yearning to take over the world being one of them. All of the other evil sidekicks return in Goldmember: Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mini Me (Verne J. Troyer), Number Two (Robert Wagner), not to mention Fat Bastard, who is played by none other than Mike Myers himself. These multiple roles of Mike Myers (Austin himself, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember) are reminiscent of Eddie Murphy's The Nutty Professor, which was also a hit comedy.<br />Goldmember is for those who revel in traditional British humor, which has not changed a bit in the years. Dr. Evil, welcoming Austin to his \\"underground lair\\", a submarine, describes it as \\"long and hard and full of seamen\\". Another joke that is simultaneously very British and very Austin, is the name of the newest mission to destroy the world, and all comments related to it. [Dr. Evil:] \\"Yes, Frau, on the whole Preparation H feels good.\\" [Scotty:] \\"Yes, Preparation H does feel good on the hole.\\" This repetition of the same themes that comedians have been using for years is the key to the success of Austin Powers. He is Americanized, yes, by tying his jokes into everyday American products-the hemorrhoid cream Preparation H being one of them-but nevertheless he is doubtless British at heart. Austin Powers has developed his own signature scenes and jokes, without which the movie would lack the intangible something-the mojo-that makes the outrageous Austin Powers world what it is. The repetition of the same jokes has created well-known Austin Powers trademarks, and it's tying the slightly altered jokes to the previous ones that makes them funny. But by far the best scenes in the movie are the ones lacking the uncouth bathroom jokes and sexual overtones that are no longer playful hinting and suggesting, but downright crude.<br /> A ludicrous opening dance scene that portrays the multiple talents of the leading actor is a must-have element of the movies, and it's a scene, by being unspoiled by repetitive sexual jokes, that depicts Austin Powers at his best. The Dr. Evil and Mini Me sing-and-dance scene is legendary: this time it's the Evilized version of Puff Daddy's \\"Hard Knock Life\\", whilein the previous episode it was Will Smith's song that was given the honor. Another scene that can be classified as one of the rare, truly good ones in the movie, is one that delves a bit deeper into the mind of Austin Powers. It's a flashback into the boyhood of Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Number Two as they are all in the academy in which international men of mystery are trained. We learn that bold and brave sex symbol Austin may not be as gallant a knight as we have been lead to believe. Although the father-son relationship is made into a joke, it's a subtle way of taking a stand against the evils of society. The same goes for Fat Bastard, who talks about how hard it is being \\"a fat kid in a society that demands perfection\\". Despite this deep insight being turned into another fart joke, truth can be found in his words. <br />It's comforting that, although nothing seems to be holy enough for the British to not be laughed at, serious insight can be squeezed in amidst all the parody.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that every age will love! With Nemo, the rebellious yet naive little clown fish, Dory the crazy walk-on-the-wild-side character that everyone loves, and Marlin the overprotective dad that many can relate to. The tank gang was hilarious as well. Wonderful wonderful wonderful! A must-see!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|Words can't describe how lame this movie is.  Some movies can pull off a low budget and still look good, but this isn't one of them.  If you saw the commercial, you literally saw every special effects shot in the movie.  The story makes no sense whatsoever.  The concept of vampires and werewolves fighting each other with guns is pointless.  Why have monsters at all if everyone's just going to shoot at each other?
0345440900|3.0|I read this book whil pregnant with my first child. I was really encouraged by the EASY plan as it seemed so logical. But trying to implement it was a whole lot harder than I thought. My son wanted to eat every 2 hours and he didn't want to sleep longer than 30 min. I tried the tips in this book but just didn't have much luck.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|Hardcore Star Trek fans are funny. When the original series went off the air they cried, moaned, screeched, and shrieked at Paramount for ten years to give them back their Trek. In 1979 Paramount gave in and gave them Star Trek-The Motion Picture. A movie I loved and I am by no means a Trekkie. Star Trek TMP was the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1979 and it came out in December! Thats big money. Yet, for going on 25 years now, I've had to read and listen to people tell me how \\"bad or slow\\" TMP was. But when they understand that the story was original and keeping with Roddenberrys vision they lighten up. This is the case with Star Trek V. For some reason if a Trekkie has to deal with an original story they have a hard time digesting it. They start picking it apart and take it literal. Yes, I love Star Treks II, III, and IV...but they are not original stories. Trek II borrows from an episode of the original series. Trek III (my personal favorite Trek movie) continues on the borrowing from Trek II, and Trek IV blatantly rips off Star Trek The Motion Picture. Basic story line to Trek IV and TMP is there is a probe that will destroy Earth if it is not communicated with and the cast has to figure out how to answer the probe so it goes away. See? TMP=original. II, III, IV=unoriginal. This is a pattern for Trekkies. They love The Next Generation, Voyager, and whatever that new show is called that is running now. Yet they are all unoriginal. Even the TNG movies borrow from the original cast plot lines. Generations even needed Kirk in it because they had no idea had to be original. First contact borrowed the time travel premise, Nemesis basically remade Star Trek II, etc, etc. <BR>Star Trek V is a VERY ORIGINAL STORY. The basic premise is a renegade Vulcan (itself an original idea) thinks God is calling to him and he has to go find him. Great idea! Throw in the fact that the renegade Vulcan is Spocks brother and a Klingon subplot and you have the makings of a fun Trek movie!And it IS a fun Trek movie! The only thing I will concede is the effects are not up to par with the other films. It looks like they were trying early CGI (computer images) and it didn't come off too well. But I still accept it. I also believe that Shatner did a great job of directing. Shatner gets a bad rap for no reason. The guy was known as being \\"difficult\\" but all he did was fight for his characters integrity when he didn't agree with something in a script. So what. <br />This 2 DVD set is awesome as well! Tons of extras and deleted scenes! Excellent commentary by Shatner! Notably missing from the commentary was Nimoy. Why? Shatner helped Nimoy with the commentary on IV. Why didn't Nimoy return the favor? <BR>So, don't believe these picky Trekkers. A picky Trekker would put down even Mickey Mouse and not like him because mice can't speak. Check this movie out. If you have been hating on this movie for 15 years, then read my review again and remember this is an ORIGINAL story. Maybe you'll see it in a different way.<BR>I sell more merchandise for TMP and V than I do for ANY other Star Trek movie or TV series. What does that tell you? Tells me there are alot of fans in the closet when it comes to the most original Trek movies ever made!<BR>Finally, the best line ever muttered in any Trek movie occurs in Star Trek V when McCoy is referring to Spock and says \\"I liked him better before he died!\\" Very funny!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A wonderful gentle movie that I'm still enjoying after several viewings.  Clearly Mr Lynch is not afraid to experiment and deliver something different and this is so unlike his previous output.  Judging from some of the reviews this is not a movie for everyone but fortunately the one or two stars are in a minority.  Most of  the others, like me, appreciated the slow moving (just like five mph Deere mower) unfolding of Alvin's big adventure and the folks he met.  Where else other than the Midwest, where honesty comes as standard, could this story take place.<br />There is so much to enjoy!  Angelo Badalamenti creates the perfect bluegrass style theme music, cinematographer Freddie Francis captures the gorgeous colors of the Midwest, the actors and especially Richard Farnsworth sparkle.  Great lines, too, Alvin says to a hitchhiker, who has run away from home and shares a meal with him around the campfire, &quot;A warm bed in a house sounds a mite better than eating a hot dog on a stick with an old geezer travelling on a lawn mower&quot;.<br />The 'Straight Story' is a little gem and I bet I'll still be enjoying its warmth and honesty for a long time.
B00006G8HX|5.0|Gather 'round! I'm going to make a believer out of you and convince you that this is the BEST ST Movie ever made! This is the second movie of what I like to call the \\"Star Trek trilogy\\". ST II, III, IV are all one long contiuous movie. However, this one stands out, while it is not original because it is continuing from ST II, it does present a lot of new and creative ideas that have been recycled for other Trek movies! <BR>This movie introduces us to the modern day Klingon! Without THIS MOVIE the Klingons would not be the same. The Klingon language, while not invented in this movie, is expanded upon brilliantly! The \\"new\\" Klingon and language was introduced in ST-The Motion Picture. If you own this DVD then you already know how they came up with the new look for the Klingons and the language! Just one of the many great featurettes on this DVD!<BR> Without THIS MOVIE we would not have the coolest ship in all of Star Trek, the Klingon Bird of Prey! No question, the Bird of Prey is awesome!<BR> Without THIS MOVIE we would not have the cloaking device! Engenious! The cloaking device sets up the entire plot of ST VI. With out THIS MOVIE there is no plot for ST VI as we know it!<BR> As a lot of you may know, there is an actual Klingon camp that people can go to and dress up like Klingons and learn to speak the language and learn the Klingon ways! Without THIS MOVIE you have no Klingon Camps!<BR> Christopher Loyd is absolutely magnificent as Kruge! I love his performance! He even outdoes Khan as a bad guy! No question! Yes, Khan is a great bad guy for Kirk to handle but they never even share one scene in the movie. Kruge not only outwits Kirk but he also, albeit inadvertently, kills Kirks son. Then he keeps coming at Kirk even while the Genesis planet is blowing up all around them! Can't see Khan doing that!<BR> Again we see yet another thing THIS MOVIE brings to later movies. Without THIS MOVIE the Klingon empire would'nt be obsessed with Kirk. In Star Trek V the Klingonswant to catch him for murdering Kruge and stealing the Bird of Prey and the Klingon obsession with Kirk carries over in Star Trek VI.  Note: Right after this movie Christopher Loyd went to work on a little movie called Back to the Future! <BR>Without THIS MOVIE you have no Excelsior. Again, another pivotal thing in Star Trek VI.<BR>THIS MOVIE was one of the first to tinker with DNA. You had to be there, but in between Star Trek II and III one had to wonder and debate how are they going to bring Spock back? The guy is dead. It not only makes sense, how they bring him back, but it is the most ingenious idea of the ENTIRE ST movie franchise. It also dips into an essence ingredient of Science Fiction and that is Terra Forming. Genetically altering an environment. I saw this movie in a packed, sold out, theater and when Saavik discovers there is \\"life\\" coming from Spocks tube/casket...you could here a collective gasp from the audience. Again, you had to be there. It's completely believable in the Star Trek realm.<BR>THIS MOVIE has the single greatest on-screen moment of ANY ST movie and that is when Kirks son, David, is murdered. Shatner is brilliant. NO OTHER ST Captain could EVER pull off such a moment. Can anyone see Picard or Janeway in a moment like that? Nope. Can you imagine Picard trying to deal with Kruge? He would want to talk his ear off rather than fight him! That brings me to the last greatest moment of this film...<BR>Kruge has clearly KO'd Kirk. But what does Kirk do? He blows up the Enterprise! Fantastic! The shot of the Enterprise blowing up is incredible! Here is this iconic ship, a ship that in Star Trek-The Motion Picture they took great care to show you all of the detail and splendor of this new and improved Enterprise, and in ST III it is just obliterated! Awesome!<BR> McCoy delivers the second greatest line of any ST movie and he describes Kirk to a T when they beam down to Genesis and watch fireball that was the Enterprise streak across the sky.Kirk says \\"My God, Bones, what have I done?\\" and McCoy says \\"What you always do...turn death into a fighting chance to live.\\" So without THIS MOVIE the Enterprise would never have been destroyed! How many times does TNG rip that off?<BR>THIS FILM was Nimoys first Directing job and he does a brilliant job! This DVD features tons of great stuff! Namely, the directors commentary from Nimoy. The only drawback, to Nimoys commentary, is he kind of comes off like an old grandpa telling you the same story you've heard him tell about 100 times. Example: between the featurettes and the directors commentary Leonard tells us no less than FOUR TIMES the story of how Michael Eisner was not going to let him direct the film because of a supposed claus in Nimoys contract that he would only come back if can direct the film. <BR>Shatner, on the other hand, is great in the featurettes as he tells of how he put out a fire on the set and how he doesn't \\"trust\\" Nimoy. Funny stuff, you'll have to buy the DVD to see what I mean.<BR>So, if you're not convinced that this is the greatest ST film ever, then you need to look at my review again and see all of the history this movie has created! Enjoy the show!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the only album that i've ever bought which was worth listening. Every song on this record has it's own unique style and versatility. I mean all the songs are good. I wonder which tracks she's going to make as a single, because all of the songs should be singles. Anyways here are the ratings of the songs:<br />1)Me against the music- A- great song and beats<BR>2)(I got that) Boom Boom- A Awesome collaboration. Perfect song which should become a single.<BR>3)Showdown- B+. Another song that has a reggea vibe to it. <BR>4)Breathe on me- A- Another amazing song with a techno feel to it. It sounds a lot like what Madonna or Kylie Minogue would do.<BR>5)Early mornin'-Worst song on the album. Moby did a bad job on it. A filler type of song. C-<BR>6)Toxic-A++ Besst song on the album. It has an awesome beat. Probably one of the best beats out there. It has violins and a techno vibe to it. Love the video as well!!!<BR>7)Outrageous- A- Good song. It was produced by R.Kelly. Great sing-along.<BR>8)Touch of my hand- Between B+ and A-. Good song with the chinese violins in the background. It's a song about masturbation. OHHHHH!!! HOT HOT SONG!!<BR>9)The Hook up- B  a reggea song. I love her jamaican accent. It's a good song for the clubs.<BR>10)Shadow- First ballad on the album.It was produced by the Matrix. Awesome ballad that showcases Britneys vocal talent. Her voice is not that great. But it suits the song. Grade= A<BR>11)Brave new girl- A- a bubblegum pop track. It's a really good song that you can sing along to. It has an 80's feel to it.<BR>12)Everytime- A+ Second best song that i will guarantee will be her next single. An awesome and touching ballad that makes a lot of people cry cause it's about relationships. This song was for britney's ex Justin.<BR>13)Me against the music(remix)- C+ Not a good remix. I'm not a fan of remixes and Indian music cause this remix adds indian beats to it.<br />This album is amazing. Words can't explain how good it is. Awsome just awsome. Get this album right now. <br />Predicted singles: First 4 singles<br />1)Me against the music<BR>2)Toxic<BR>3)Everytime<BR>4)(I got that) Boom Boom
B0000683DH|5.0|It's funny how the entire Star Trek franchise owes it's life to a guy who was never a fan! This is just one fact of many you will learn from this awesome 2 disc set! Nicholas Meyer, the director of this landmark movie, brought a new vision and look to the franchise when he signed on to direct this movie. I never knew a thing about this guy but from watching all the extras and listening to his commentary he seems like a brilliant director. He also has a quirky sense of explaining his vision, but you'll have to see and hear for yourself!<BR>After the success of Star Trek-The Motion Picture (yes SUCCESS. Released in December, it was the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1979.) Paramount decided to use a new director and a new vision to try and top the first movie. They found it in Nicholas Meyer! However, Star Trek II is not an original story as it borrows an old concept from the original series. But it does work! Ricardo Montalban is incredible in this movie! (Ricardo has been so underused by Hollywood) When I was a kid I saw this movie in a packed, sold out, theater and everyone was cheering when the Enterprise disabled the Reliant and everyone was crying when Spock died. I can still see peoples faces in the crowds crying. It was like he was ET or something! (yes, Trekkies, I know...Spock IS an ET...) <BR>Just like with TMP, getting Leonard Nimoy (Spock) onboard was like pulling teeth. They had to fly to Isarael and literally get on their hands and knees and beg Nimoy to do this film! (Don't believe me? It's in the featurettes.)At first Nimoy didn't want to do this movie...until he found out they killed off Spock! He admits this in the featurettes. Kind of a slap in the face to fans, but as the movie was almost completed he was having second thoughts. So they put in the &quot;Remember&quot; line with McCoy at the end in case this movie was a hit. Shatner is awesome in this movie as well! Him yelling &quot;KHAN!!!&quot; has got to be one of the all time classic moments inmovie history! <BR>Fortunately this movie was a huge hit. (made less than TMP, but generated new enthusiasm for the series and Paramount knew this) <BR>I like how they added in the new scenes for this DVD and I also see why they were taken out for the original theatrical release. The part with the bugs in the ear still gets me to this day and the effects still hold up! Excellent movie! Excellent casting! Excellent direction! <BR>Star Trek II unfortunately did not produce half the merchandise TMP did and I wonder why to this day.<BR>I love the old cast the best. No question about it. This cast can only be poorly imitated and never replaced. True fans can write off all that is not from the original series and the original cast movies because it is all unoriginal and repetitive. This is coming from a person who was not even born when the original series went off the air! I just know what I see.<BR>There are very few MUST OWN DVD's, but this IS a must own!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Awesome cd!!! This is definetely the best album of 2003. It is so unique and versatile. Britney has really matured. &quot;Toxic&quot; clearly is the highlight of the album. Amazing song with amazing beats. Love the video too. &quot;Early mornin is the worst song on the album. It's so boring and it just doesn't suit my taste. Britney's gonna have a hard time picking out her singles because all the songs are good. Get this album right now. You won't regret it.<br />Predictions for the first four singles:<br />1)Me against the music f. Madonna<BR>2)Toxic<BR>3)Everytime<BR>4)(I got that) Boom Boom
B00005JKC3|4.0|Firstly, let me say that 4 stars does not mean that I watch this movie every night, but my rating represents my overall feelings towards the film and DVD (because we're in the business of rating DVDs here, right?). My guess is also that most of those who reviewed the film had certain expectations that they feel were not met. Well if you knew that it was Ang Lee directing, then I suspect you atleast gave your expectations some thought. Because if you were hoping this movie to resemble a Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Pearl Harbour) picture then you obviously were going to be disappointed. This movie isn't supposed to be like all the other comic book hero remakes.<br />I thought the ACTING was all around good. I really believed Eric Bana in his role, because he isn't playing a cartoon cut-out...he's playing a complex character. I think he handled the inner conflicts and emotions really well. Jennifer Connelly and Sam Shepard are excellent too. You believe right away that Shepard could be a high ranking military official, and yet like in Big Lobowski, he has a twinkle in his eye, and you sense he isn't as ice cold as most movies depict their 'army bad guys' to being. As for Nick Nolte, well, I don't know the last time I saw this guy not look hungover, so I don't think this role was much of a stretch. Anyway, you learn very quickly to dislike him (the character). <br />The CINEMATOGRAPHY was really fascinating at times, and this usually went hand in hand with the excellent Danny Elfman SCORE. Remember, Elfman is the same guy who scored Spiderman. But he's a lot more adventurous this time around. The scenes with the desert landscape, vegetation and close ups of rocks are accompanied by some gorgeous doudouk (Armenian wind instrument) music. <br />The EDITING was totally unique, utilising various types of split screen tricks reminding you of the movie's Comic Book origins. We're not used to this style of scene transitions, so it can feel a bit weird -- I applaud the idea, becauseof it's originality, but I don't know if I like it. Maybe it's a bit too clever for its own good.<br />The EFFECTS for the Hulk are pretty good. They're better than I expected. But people will disagree. It's inevitable, because nearly every other scene is atleast based on reality, so you instantly notice this big green Hulk in contrast, and are easily tempted to cry foul. The battle in the desert is pretty spectacular though. Great action sequences.<br />DISLIKES: The opening credit sequence - while helpful in explaining the backstory - is about 4 minutes long. I think it could have been rushed along a bit more. The pacing isn't always that comfortable either, but I can see past that. The showdown between father and son makes logical sense to me (in the storytelling sense), but I would have preferred the father to retire from the story earlier on in the movie. <br />The DVD: I liked the Making Ofs, expecially my usual favourites (casting &amp; music/sound). Also, it was amusing to see Ang Lee in the blue suit acting out how he felt the Hulk should move. Good extras. Ang Lee's commentary was low-key, but insightful.<br />The movie didn't do as well at the Box Office as desired (though $130 million US Domestic is hardly a flop), so there are talks of there not being a sequel. But that's fine by me. Why does every movie have to have a sequel? What's wrong with a good idea done once? <br />OVERALL ... Textured. Unexpected. Emotional. I find it hard to sum up. It's Ang Lee, so it's not going to float everyone's boat. But I'm a fairly non-superficial guy, and I liked that this film, the story, the characters, the dynamics between the characters, that all of this was not shallow. It has a soul. I think that if you give it a chance, you'll find things to like.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Hey!  K,i swear that this movie is soooooooooooooo awesome...i guess it's kinda a chick-flick...but, hey, I'm a Chick (my b-friend says a hot one too!) No, seriously, this is my altime fav movie
B00005YW4H|3.0|I listened to this twice, put it on my shelf, and haven't picked it up since.  It's pleasant, but not the least bit memorable.  Normally, I only rate albums that strike me at the \\"5-star\\" or \\"4-star\\" level, but I make an exception here for this reason:  I can name you 7 women jazz singers who display better musicianship and are more stunning:  Not necessarily in this order, Tierney Sutton; Jackie Ryan; Kendra Shank; Kate McGarry; Barbara Sfraga; Laurie Wheeler; and Katie Bull.  Chances are great that all of the albums of all 7 of these women don't add up to the number of sales of this one.  But if Norah Jones leads you to these 7, and in turn leads you to Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Betty Carter and Sarah Vaughan, then it's worth it.  I.e., if Norah Jones proves to be the \\"Blood Sweat and Tears\\" of the Y-Generation, then this album served its purpose.
0452282152|1.0|I really wish publishers would start stating on the book cover whether or not the novel contained within has a plot.  This one does not, or at least not much of one.  <br />I'm not interested in reading character studies, and if I was, this wouldn't be one I had liked. An untrained, uneducated serving girl has the know how to fix the arrangement of a master artist's paintings so they become great.  Uh huh.  I don't think so.  And even worse, I didn't care about her, the artist, or anyone else in the book.  <br />Don't waste your money.  Find something with a plot.
B0000C8ARD|5.0|I heard this before Diana Krall got really big, and I loved it.  In retrospect, I still love it.  Her turn on Frishberg's \\"Peel Me a Grape\\" is probably the most sultry jazz tune ever--and that includes Peggy Lee's \\"Fever.\\"  Speaking of that, you'll find yourself humming Miss Lee's signature tune when you hear Ms. Krall cover the neglected Mayfield '50's classic, \\"My Love Is A Mountainside.\\"  The set-ender \\"Garden in the Rain\\" shows the lyrical side of this artist.  Alas, she hasn't since equalled or topped this wonderful album; but, there's still time.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|I was a fan of the old TV series 'Wild, Wild West' - full of action, adventure, pretty women, weird plots and advanced super-weapons - what more could you want?  How about Will Smith and Kevin Kline as James West and Artemus Gordon?  How about Salma Hayek in a corset?  How about Kenneth Branagh with 20th century weapons?  Tanks, trains and airplanes!<br />This film is LOTS of fun and full of humor.  For example, near the end of the film, The giant spider even blows up half the town of Silverado, which in fact is the set made for the movie \\"Silverado\\".  So they saved money AND recycled.<br />The DVD has lots of extras, from the commentary by the director, to behind-the-scenes documentaries, to the music videos!
B000099T2L|5.0|Oh My! This CD is exceptional. The lyrics, the beats, the whole cd shouts &quot;excellent&quot;. All the songs, from Crazy in love to the soulful, &quot;daddy&quot; gives us a lot to ponder on; like i said, buying albums for me is not a hobby, its if its something worth listening to, and something that is just not words with a beat, and this definitely fits that description. Beyonce is a diva, and this cd reflects that.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I purchased this album on the recommendation of a fellow coworker and I must say that the CD is incredible.  The CD invites you to listen from the begining to the end with music that inspires.  <br />Highly recommended.
0385504209|1.0|The book is a fast paced thriller that would probably make a great movie.  The core problem is that is presents &quot;facts&quot; throughout the book regarding the origins of Christianity.  If you review any published commentary on the book, you will find that it is poorly researched and most &quot;facts&quot; in the books are just warmed over theories, most of which are not based on any historical facts.  Reader beware - DO NOT READ anything in the book as a true fact!  With that in mind, where is the outrage regarding The Da Vinci Code?  Where are the pundits on Fox, CNN and MSNBC decrying the No.1 bestseller that mixes &quot;fact&quot; and fiction in such irresponsible manner, leaving the reader with the impression that Christianity is just hoax?  Where are those people who vehemently objected to Mel Gibson's movie, &quot;The Passion&quot; but who apparently have no problem with a book (and a movie) that questions whether there is any legitimate basis to Christian beliefs?  This is not just an attack on the Christian religion, it is attack on all organized religions including Judaism and Islam.  The book is both anti-Catholic and anti-religion, and in wierd way - pro-pagan.  The mainstream media has used the book as opportunity to explore the role of woman in early Christianity.  That is just a sideshow, the book is a frontal assault on most Americans' core beliefs. The misinformation contained in the book will only spread further once the movie is released which is sure to be a blockbuster.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|i am so sick and tired of comparing this album to FTE!  people claim the lyrics here are badly written, but they're no worse than the lyrics on FTE!  i prefer the arrangements here to FTE and i really believe this is a better album.  just listen to her voice on dirty little secret:  has she ever sounded so beautiful?  if you can get over the fact that this is not FTE, you'll probably love it.  if you're still stuck in the past, continue listening to FTE and quit dissing this album!
B00005V9HH|5.0|I bought this dvd based on suggestions from some friends...I didn't realize how much I was gonna love it until I watched it the 2nd & 3rd time{by which I used the 2 commentaries available} I still feel the need to rediscover stuff I never noticed & even rewatch the other special features. This is a definate keeper.
B000000OQF|2.0|This is Guns'n'Roses best album according to most.  I'd agree, but it still sucks.  Guns'n'Roses are white trash; their music is so stupid.  People argue that the 80's were a horrible time for rock.  The truth is it was one of the best times for rock, the problem is the mainstream music blew.  People were listening to Guns'n'Roses or The Motley Crue, instead of good music like Stiff Little Fingers, The Clash, Gun Club etc.  Not into punk?  There was still plenty, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Pixies etc.  Yet people waste their time with bands like Guns'n'Roses.
B00005YW4H|5.0|There's not much else to say about this.  It had to grow on me for a while before I fell in love with it.  Now, I'm a fan.  You probably will be too if you give it a chance.
0061015725|5.0|I picked up this book, and started reading it and i just seriously could not stop.  It kept my attention the whole time, there were no dull parts to me, if you end up buying this book, the minute you pick it up you will find yourself not wanting to put it down until you hear what happens.<br />Great book<BR>highly recomended
0800177177|3.0|This version of Dracula is by far the most extravagant of all its incarnations, and its visual decadence is really what the makes the film. The Count Dracula (Gary Oldman), after battling Muslim invaders, returns home to find his true love (Winona Ryder) dead, a suicide in reaction to false reports that the count himself was dead. Four hundred years later, in late 19th century London, his love has apparently been reincarnated in the form of Mina, a young girl engaged to the man who has been sent to investigate him (Keanu Reeves). Once Dracula realizes that Mina is the living form of his true love, he sets out to claim her, and chaos and violence ensues. The actually story is really too complicated to fully explain here, and the script is really only a framework for the dazzling visual aspects of the film. The limited space here cannot contain descriptions of the artistic direction and cinematography of the movie and do them justice. <br /> <br />As far as the acting, Ryder is the one to watch. Although Anthony Hopkins does well as the doctor who believes in Dracula's existence, it is Ryder's Mina who is the most complex. She is the only one who makes you care about her character as the others only seem like attractive props. Oldman is scary but I think that his makeup did most of the acting for him. And Keanu Reeves is, well, Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that while the most intense chemistry should have taken place between Oldman and Ryder, it is the tension between Ryder and Reeves that is the most believable. Their wedding scene is more erotically charged than anything between Dracula and his lost bride, when the opposite should have been true. If Mina is supposed to be so seduced by this stranger, you'd never know it. Actually, I read somewhere that Ryder and Oldman hated each other so much that all of the more intimate scenes were filmed in one take. And you can definitely tell. <br /> <br />It's a long movie and the characters, except for Mina, aren't very likeable. But every frame of this movie is a work of Gothic art, which may be enough for some audiences.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's new album \\"In The Zone\\" is by far her best work. I have been a fan of Britney's since her 1999 single and CD \\"...Baby One More Time\\". This CD has many club, dancing tracks and a few slow songs.<br />1. (10/10) Me Against The Music (featuring Madonna): When the single first was release I was very dissapointed and didn't like the song at all. After I listened to it a few times, I really came to like the fast chorus lyrics and how Madonna sung with her. The video is awesome!<br />2. (9/10) (I Got That) Boom Boom (featuring Ying Yang Twins): Not the best song on the album but definatly has hip beats and great lyrics. Ying Yang Twins callaborated with Britney well. <br />3. (10/10) Showdown: Love this song, one of my favorites, very sexy lyrics in here. Britney sounds really good and her singing/talking really turns you on! Awesome beats throughout the whole song.<br />4. (10/10) Breathe On Me: When I first heard this song, it sounded so much like a Kylie Minogue song and I loved it. The lyrics and the way Britney's voice sounds is unbelievable and very sexy. Love this song, especially when blasting in the car!<br />5. (9.5/10) Early Mornin': I never liked Moby but this song is by far the best song he's ever written, or will ever write for that matter. I love this song and I can totally relate to it. Awesome beats to dance to. \\"Call all your friends..\\"<br />6. (12/10) Toxic: The best song of Britney's ever! This is my favorite song on the album and I listen to it constantly because it is so good. The beat just makes you want to get up and dance. When I first heard it, it reminded me of a spy kind of song, from James Bond or something. So glad it's the second single off the album<br />7. (10/10) Outrageous: Written by R. Kelly, Britney sounds so good and the chorus is very catchy. This is almost like a hip-hop side of Britney which sounds really cool. Love the lyrics.<br />8. (10/10) The Touch Of My Hand: Britney sings about masturbation. Didn't realize that when I first heard about it. Has a chinese-like beat that really sounds good and goes perfect with the song. I think everyone can relate to this song, male or female.<br />9. (10/10) The Hook Up: A great party song to dance to! Great beats and awesome lyrics that actually make you want to \\"Hook Up\\". The chorus is very catchy and you'll want to listen to it over and over.<br />10. (9/10) Shadow: This song has a really nice slow beat at first that is very relaxing. What can I say? Another good song.<br />11. (10/10) Brave New Girl: Britney sings really fast in this song that makes you want to know the lyrics and sing along. The song sounds like it should be in a movie, like Legally Blonde or something.<br />12. (10/10) Everytime: One of my favorite. Haunting ballad, very sad. Everyone is saying that this is the song about Britney's bad break-up with Justin Timberlake, but never jump to conclusions. This song actually kind of makes you want to cry.. but I still love it, no doubt.<br />13. (9/10) BONUS REMIX: Me Against The Music (featuring Madonna): A good remix, but not as near good as the original. I don't think any remix can compare to the original, but I still like to listen to the song, a different 'Me Against The Music' flavor. <br />In a nutshell, this is the best album and I love all the songs on it. I listen to it pretty much everyday since the first day it came out. If you listen to the entire album, it is kind of like a story. Britney co-wrote 8 of the 12 songs. I guarentee, Britney fanatic, or not, that you will love this album as much as I did.
B00000IREA|3.0|Barbarella is a bad film on so many levels that I cannot even begin to pick it apart. But in an age when the recent Charlie's Angels movies are considered \\"empowering\\" for women and video game heroines offer more than any human vixen can, Barbarella looks almost classy. It is a movie that makes no apologies; everything is gratuitious and no one tries to justify its atrocities of political incorrectness. To those who were not around when it was originally released (myself being 16 years too late), picture an Austin Powers movie but replace Mike Myers with--all right, Jane Fonda has no modern equivalent--but it's the same kind of camp without the irony. I wish movies like this could be made today without the pretense of insisting that scantily clad heroines are \\"positive female role models.\\" It's so sleazy and witty at the same time. It's truly awful and yet that's what makes it endearing.
B00005ATQF|2.0|This is a fantastic movie, but please read other reviews regarding the acting, camera work, plot, storyline, etc. This review is only about the DVD version.<br />The DVD itself is a major disappointment. Poor transfer, no extras, no surround sound, full screen only, and hardly even a menu or chapter selection. Like the other Stanley Kubrick DVDs in this white-box series, this Full Metal Jacket is pretty much a VHS dub of the movie - only thrown together onto a DVD. I'm suprised that it's not double sided like the original commercial DVDs were. <br />Given the advances in DVD technology when this disk was released there was no need to sell such a lackluster product, besides trying to get as many Stanley Kubrick movies as possible into one big boxed set before Christmas of 1999. This movie, The Shining, and to a lesser extent, A Clockwork Orange all suffer from this same exceedingly poor DVD treatment.<br />Hopefully soon this movie will be re-released in a better DVD package, much like Goodfellas or The Shining needs. Until then, buy this DVD only if you're a huge fan or if it's laying in the bargain bin.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|David Bowie's output remains surprisingly frequent. Only a year after the \\"Heathen\\" album\\" comes the latest, \\"Reality\\". The good news is that this album is the first Bowie album in a LONG time that is thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end, and achieves a cohesion that lacked in recent albums.<br />\\"Reality\\" (11 tracks, 49 min.) sounds like it could have been released in the \\"Let's Dance\\" era. It is full of arena-sized rockers. Opener \\"New Killer Star\\" immediately takes to you (reminding me of \\"Heroes\\"). Other highlights include \\"Pablo Picasso, \\"Never Get Old\\", \\"Looking for Water\\", and the title track. The piece-de-resistance is the almost 8 min. \\"Bring Me the Disco King\\", not the \\"disco\\" song you might expect, but instead a jazzy-like piano-based tune, reminiscent of Depeche Mode's \\"Death's Door\\". The only oddity on the album is the George Harrison cover \\"Try Some Buy Some\\", which sounds very close to the 1973 original and musically just doen't fit in with the rest of the album.<br />I had the chance to see Bowie on the recent \\"A Reality\\" tour, and when Bowie sings \\"And I'm Never Gonna Get Old\\", boy, does he mean it! I mean, Bowie literally looks younger now (age 56) than he did, say, 10 years ago. Cool also that he still has some good songs in him, as this album amply demonstrates.
6302720419|2.0|This film actually begins quite well, although the little kid narrating it kind of made it lose the creepy feeling you had in the opening credits.  The movie is actually fairly entertaining until after our two main characers enter the house of our youthful narrator and his sister.  Up until this sour turn in events, it's a fairly noble adaption.  And then the story is wrecked, from the, al I can think of is: \\"toned down\\" ending, tothe lame interpretation of \\"He who walks Behind The rows\\".  Why do screenplay writers feel they must always change the master of horror's story around?  Everytime they do it trashes what could've been a promising film.  I've seen it in Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers, although this sucked already anyway.  It also brings to mind:  Why did they feel inclined to make a sequel?  Hollywood sickens me sometimes.
6303637493|5.0|I have eclectic tastes--I watch Fellini, Altman, Halstrom, Eastwood, and Campion with equal enjoyment.  But I have never been more impressed with a film than with &quot;Farinelli.&quot;<br />This is a character-driven story, not a plot-driven one.  In &quot;Farinelli&quot; the essential debate in all art is fully played out on film:  From whence does artistic beauty spring?  From the interpretive vehicle or the creative one?  From the source of the inspiration or from the one who is inspired?  It even dares to ask whether there is an element of destruction in the act of creation.  The triangles outlining this debate abound.  Handel-Broschi-Farinelli is underscored by the relationships between Farinelli-Broschi-Alexandra and between Performer-Composer-Audience.  I have seen this film 6 or 7 times and I still rediscover parallels along these themes.  It is an impressive achievement to use art to outline art's own tensions without ever once losing sight of the overriding storyline or forcing your actors into unnatural posturing for the sake of making a debate point.<br />Others have praised the sets, acting, music, lighting--in short, the ambience and opulence of the film.  All that is here.  And yet all that is also in &quot;Amadeus&quot; and &quot;Immortal Beloved.&quot;  What this offers that the others does not is the insider's take:  If you watch this movie, you will feel Farinelli's emotions, Broschi's emotions and Handel's emotions as they strive for recognition through their art.  This is not a movie from which you walk away sympathizing with one character or another.  This is a movie from which you walk away knowing you have lived someone else's experience for a brief time.

B000002MTR|5.0|This album is amazing, it was probably one of the best albums in 1995, and dave's guitar fit the chili pepper's style, just not the BSSM style, more like the uplift mofo party plan, the chili peppers have always changed style when a new guitarist has joined the band.
B000000OAN|5.0|If you are not sure where to begin when you decide to buy one of Queen's albums, buy &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; along with &quot;A Day At The Races&quot;.  Both of these albums deserve to be in any music fan's collection.  You will not be disappointed.
1586212222|5.0|If anyone thinks that they own the title of World's Worst Christmas Elf, buying this book is a must!  The selections are short and sweet-bittersweet that is.  I hate the holidays; I hate spending time in \\"lockdown\\" with my family, but this book is worth all of the suffering.  Sedaris is a must, from the fun of \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\", to the ghastly family newsletters every spunky family feels they must send me, \\"Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family\\".  I picked this baby up at a white elephant grabbag. It is, by far, superior to the pretzels my uncle selected or the chocolates snatched up by my mother.  If anyone out there is a sarcastic, humorous, realist-this is the book to go for.
B0000CFW87|1.0|So I'm not the sort of person qualified to review this pile of... anyways, I'm getting off track. I only listened to five minutes of this and shut it off in pure embarrasment. I hope no one heard me listening to it, or I'd have to let them beat me with a rake. As for the CD. It's a pure exercise in sucking out any true emotion out of music, smearing it with cheez, then overprocessing it's corpse until it's just a metallically rendered monument to exactly WHY the music industry will eat itself. <br />There was a reason this music became out of style in the first place. This isn't music. I don't know what this is. If you make crap smell like roses, it's still crap. Do yourself a favor, pick up music with some soul in it. You'll thank yourself later. Cheers.

B00005JKG9|1.0|This movie was just awful.  I kept waiting for something to happen and then the movie just ended.  A star studded cast sitting around an office dropping F-bombs.  That is about the sum of the movie.  It ranks up there with some of the worst movies I have ever seen.
0783228457|5.0|After the disappointing misstep of Scanners, one would have been hard pressed to predict that David Cronenberg would rebound with the quantumn leap of filmmaking that is Videodrome. After more than 20 years it is still one of the most daring and original sci-fi thrillers ever made. A dark, kinky, complex nightmare of paranoia and mind control. Cronenberg strikes a perfect balance between sensuality and depravity, hallucinations and reality, ideas and imagery. James Woods is perfectly cast as the oily Max Renn, Debbie Harry brings a vacant sexuality to Nikki Brand and the effects, while somewhat dated, are still quite distrubing. As you watch this film - and it is one that truly benefits from multiple viewings - you will actually see the moment where a filmmaker hits his stride, and it's a wonder to behold. This is the definitive Cronenberg movie.
B00006CXXU|2.0|stipped isnt a memorable album at all!! christina has lost her touch with funky songs all this is just whiney. boring and silly material and i was her i wouldnt sing about them i would keep it secret!! britney is the only mousekettier with real talent and not aguilera or jacko wannabe timberlake!! christinas first album was brilliant and she brought it out again in spanish for some random reason!! but stripped is stripped without meaning!! its boring!!! and she ruins da songs by over doing her voice!!!!! your not a fighter your a loser!!!

B00005JM20|2.0|The best part of this movie had to be the Aston Martin Vantage.  I will admit the chase scene with the car was unique.<br />I had high expectations after learning of the involvement of the writers of the last two Bond movies.  I had expected a lot more subtle humor than slapstick.<br />The movie is ok and certainly acceptable for a family evening film. Oh yeah, and Natalie would make a good Bond girl too!
0790729725|5.0|Some day this film will be recognised as one of the five or six greatest films of the 1990s.<BR>I watched this film practically by accident, only half interested in the film that was famous for being one of the best of the gangster films.<BR>I watched the first scene - the scene with the Mafia guys driving around with a corpse in a car - mildly interesting, and certainly a gangster film.<BR>But then - all of a sudden - the film freezes in a view of Henry Hill's face. And the unforgettable first line of narration is spoken: &quot;As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster&quot;.<BR>From that point on the film is an absolute joy - a procession of scenes that are incredibly inventive and whimsical in style, over the most amazingly perfect soundtrack. <BR>Although it is a masterpiece, it is also incredibly, unbelieveably funny. And not just in terms of gags or one-liners. The whole film has this cynical and anarchistic joy - such as whenever Henry Hill narrates. I believe the narration in this film, by Ray Liotta, is the funniest and best I have heard (Fight Club a close second). He is always ready with smart comments: when the mob beats up a mailman for delivering truancy notices to his house, he remarks calmly: &quot;That was it. No more letters from school - no more letters from teachers - in fact no more letters from anybody. Finally my mother had to go down to the post office and complain!&quot;<BR>First person narration in films is the hardest kind of dialogue to write, because the narrator is essentially talking to nobody - except the audience. The narration in Goodfellas is particularly noteworthy because it isn't actually written, at all. Actually, almost every word spoken by the narrator comes directly from the words of the testimony of Henry Hill as recorded by Pileggi in &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, the book upon which this film is based! The charming bit of dialogue about the mailman is directly from Henry Hill's mouth. <BR>There are countlessmemorable scenes in this film; the whole childhood montage; the scene showing wiseguys getting lobsters and red wine in jail; the montage showing Jimmy Conway's murders (including Frankie Carbone in the freezer truck!). The film's style is made more amazing because, like the narration, it is extremely realistic. The detail is incredible; and very true to the reality. Like Band of Brothers, the extreme attention to detail is carefully wedded to a masterly sense of drama. Real life, even for a gangster or paratrooper, has to be very carefully manipulated to be interesting. Scorsese does the impossible and makes a film that is at once baldly realistic, and highly contrived. It shouldn't work so well - but it does.<br />Overall, Goodfellas is a masterpiece of cinema that will probably be recognised more as such in the future.
B000127LW2|3.0|Finally ! I'll get to see Star Trek Voyager !!! Local cable did not offer a UPN or FOX channel while Voyager was being aired. ABC station carried the 1st 5 episodes and then dropped it. This will be great ! Can watch ST Enterprise and VOYAGER..like 2 new ST shows at same time ! Now just hope that ENTERPRISE will be released in a few years !
B00006EXDM|1.0|First, let me say that these songs are <BR>incredible; there's no denying how good <BR>these songs are. That's not what I'm here to <BR>write about. I'm absolutely outraged that <BR>Virgin can remaster these discs for the second <BR>time and charge 18-19 bucks a disc for the <BR>Stones ABKCO catalog ! This stuff has been <BR>around for over 30 years and has made tons <BR>and tons and tons of cash for everyone involved, <BR>except Virgin which bought these masters from <BR>ABKCO a few years ago. Further, most of the <BR>early studio albums are about 30 minutes long. <BR>These could and should have been two-fers, priced <BR>at around 15 bucks. But this sickening greed will <BR>prevent me from every upgrading the 1989 ABKCO <BR>remasters. Even If I could afford it, I wouldn't <BR>give a dime to these weasals. The Stones, themselves, <BR>are somewhat to blame for seeking more piles of <BR>hundred dollar bills to burn in their fireplaces <BR>each night when they signed a new contract with <BR>Virgin in 1996. But in the end it's the fans who <BR>get the shaft. I've bought about a dozen Stones <BR>records once or twice on vinyl and once again <BR>on CD, and It royally pisses me off that these <BR>dirtbags want 36 bucks for &quot; Hot Rocks &quot;. I hope <BR>these greedhead record companies all burn in a <BR>very special hell ! In a few years, they'll regret <BR>doing this because they will be obsolete. We'll <BR>be buying music directly from the artists. Boo <BR>hooo and good riddance EMI/Virgin !
6304140711|5.0|This movie is the most terrifying movie that I have ever seen.(And I am a horror-movie buff) This movie is so creepy, so electrifying that it is scary(please excuse that punn) This movie has a hot young cast of some  extremely talented actors, including the  beautiful Alyssa Milano and Reese Witherspoon, and a young fellow of the name Mark Wahlberg. I can pretty much tell what is going to happen with movies. I couldn't tell a thing in this movie. This is not just your  run of the mill teen hororr/suspence/thiller/Mystery type of movie. This movie is a great movie to enjoy and a great life-lesson  (or moral, if you will) wihout actually living it. I won't tell what the lesson is, but Reese Witherspoon is generally in movies that teach something at the end, so be sure to look for it at the end and during this film.  This movie is so great in every way possible. By far the best[for me] hororr film of them all! Great movie!!! Very similar to \\"Fatal Attraction\\" But, geared towards a teen auidence. Both films are great, but also both have cerin material that DIDN'T have to be in there. VERY realsitic, in the sense that there are teens who choose to...ummm...well spend \\"quality\\" time with each other, and do live to regret that \\"quality\\" time spent. Alot of the time, that person that you spent the time with, ISN'T the person you thought they were. Very creepy. \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and \\"Fear\\" are similar, and different at the same time. \\"Fear\\" is pratically a re-make of \\"Fatal Attraction\\" which it sortta is...
B00005JMF6|4.0|This movie is so well done. I loved this movie. You know when Hallie Berry is in a movie, you know that it has to be good. Remember, she is an Oscar-Winner, so she CAN act and is taken seriously as an actress. This movie is more Thiller, than hororr, but still, very good! A tad on the predictable, but a very good occult movie. I gave this movie four stars, because  of it's predictablity. But, I have always been able to guess what was coming next with movies though, so maybe it won't be as predictable for you, as it was for me(which byt he way, was not much) I could barely guess what was coing next. This movie is fast pase, and never slows down for air. I could predict, I know I said that before, but just as a reminder. Hallie Berrie Fan? Then this movie, you'll love.Although, not sually her genre, she does a terrific job!!
B000002KIE|1.0|Basically if you think you're punk cuz you listen to this, well you're nothing but a stupid trendy poseur who says all the punk things, listen to all the punk things, and conforms to all the punk things. These guys were manufactured and told what to sing and what to wear and I can't stand poseurs like them or all of you that think this is punk. No! This isn't punk. Manufactured poseur cr@p!
0446310786|1.0|I read this book recently in class because it was requred reading. I love reading, and read several books a week. TKaM however was terrible. There is almost no plot, and the charecters were poorly developed and obviously fake. It gets boring after a few minutes, and is never all that exciting. It is also hard to follow what is going on near the end. It may be a classic, but it sure is not a good one!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I'm not going to lie, this cd probably should have been made in the late eighties, during the van halen, guns n roses era.  It has an old sound of classic rock and you can't help but love it.  Classic beats, straight drums and guitar solos the works.  Rock on Jet, Rock on.
B00000373U|5.0|Countless reviews have analyzed Smith's records, including this one, with perception, accuracy, and an effective summary of the album, Smith's talents, etc. However, just listen to it.<br />Are you a pretty average human being? Have you felt doubt? Confusion? Heartache? Fear? Frustration? Well, I'm betting that when you listen to Elliott, you're gonna say &quot;Yeah man, that's what it feels like&quot;. Unless you're some unreal fabricated person like a schwing-athon 19 year old on those WB network shows, you're probably gonna feel touched when you listen to Elliott.<br />Only a few of the best reviews I've seen really hit the nail on the head, when it comes to his work. You can't really break it down - yeah there are great lyrics, yeah his voice is awesome, yeah the music is good. But it's not just the pieces - it's the WHOLE THING. I won't even quote lyrics here, 'cause even though they often look impressive on paper, that's just robbing them of their true value when you hear them in the songs.<br />Yeah, Elliott incorporated elements from lots of earlier musicians. Yet, I like his stuff better than most of theirs. It all depends on whether his blend of elements and his &quot;touch&quot; hits you. But, like I said, unless you're not really a human, you'll probably feel it. He might not have the &quot;masterful&quot; touch of giants like, say, the Beatles or the Beach Boys. Whatever - Elliott's stuff WORKS. Who needs an arrow to be immaculately polished in order to feel its sweet sting?<br />I can more or less say the same stuff for Elliott's &quot;XO&quot;. But this one is EVEN BETTER. Anyway, it's pointless to compare them - you need BOTH. :) &quot;Roman Candle&quot; and &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; are quite great too - they're a bit different in sound, though, than this and &quot;XO&quot;. This and &quot;XO&quot; are probably more &quot;accessible&quot; to his lesser fans.<br />He'll probably never make it onto any of those daft &quot;Rock's 100 Best Albums&quot;or other inane pop music hype &quot;countdown&quot; lists. Whatever - his stuff is great - and in any evolved world, Elliott would rise way above that other crap.<br />If you decide not to listen to him, well... in life, sometimes you're just gonna make bad decisions.<br />Smith's &quot;suicide&quot; death wasn't really tragic, because he already left something great for this world.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I went to see this movie with many doubts, but it was the first Christmas themed movie of the season and I was ready to be excited. I was one hundred percent wrapped up in the entire film from the moment it started to the moment it ended. This movie is brilliant and is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I highly suggest this movie to anyone.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I love this CD the rhythm is calming and has a small element of jazz.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt her other CD is better.  I would recommend buying her other CD.  This CD was very overlooked when it came out and deserves more recognition.  All the songs are beautiful and her voice seems to fit the melody perfectly.
B0000640VO|5.0|First off the visuals are some of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Audrey Tautou is the second best part of this film. She was very lovable and very cute I might add. She carried the film and kept me fixed on her puppy dog eyes and beautiful features. If you don't mind reading subtitles and want to get in a good mood, check out this wonderful French film everyone is talking about.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I can kind of see what the idea is supposed to be here. This is supposed to be like a young person's guide to the Beatles. A whole lot of really good Beatles songs in one place for a good price. Great idea. Its about time that those youngster listen to some good music. But this good idea has a bad exectution. I used to work in the record store and had to hear this album A LOT. Now a lot of these songs are great, but ALOT of my favorites are missing. And there is a defenite problem with pacing. (Problems that a 2 disc package could solve.) A lot of Beatles singles were double a-sides. The b-sides were as good as the a sides. I would direct newbies to the Past Masters collection rather than this, becuase you get all the a and b sides of the Beatles non-album singles in one place. <br />But maybe, you don't want that. Past Masters misses out on things like &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and material from the White album (as does 1, because there were no singles off it, leaving a group called Mortimer to have a hit with a sound-alike version of &quot;Oblidi-Oblida.&quot;) There is a collection that solves this problem, the famous red and blue albums. However this might shy away young people for a few reasons: the packaging is very 70's, the mixes leave ALOT to be desired, the whole package is four discs and they aren't even full lenght. A Forty Licks package would have worked much better; 2 80 minute discs with excellent refurbished songs. This would allow the Beatles most popular hits to intermingle with equally good (if not even better) fan favorites, b-sides, album tracks and covers. (I mean come on, how can you have a Beatles collection without &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; I mean really.) <br />Other things The Beatles could learn from the Stones: the Beatles entire UK and US catalouges should be issued on hybrid CD/SACDs. (this might even mean including 'The Early Beatles' and 'Rarities' (this should be supplimented with more [and better] outtakes.)OR all the British cds could at least be reissued with better mixes packaging and extra stuff (the non-album UK singles maybe put together with their coresponding albums, and add in some out-takes, alternates, live cuts and mono mixes ala Rhino's reissue packages.)<br />The Beatles made some of the best Pop and Rock music of the 20th Century and desrves to be presented to the world that way, not crappy overpriced 70s/80s quality reisses and poorly thought out best ofs.
B00006AW2G|5.0|No sense writing a review for Stones fans, 'cause they already know LET IT BLEED is one of their best ever.  (My personal order of their best is 1. LET IT BLEED  2. STICKY FINGERS  3. BEGGAR'S BANQUET  4. EXILE ON MAIN STREET, all from their 1968-1972 era.)  This is for the casual or newer fan who thinks they've got the Stones covered by owning FORTY LICKS.  You can't appreciate how good the Stones were unless you listen to some of the tracks that never made it to FORTY LICKS.  &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; is a track that only the 1969 Stones could have done. (Notice it's never been covered by another band?) That song and &quot;Monkey Man&quot; are so good that Iggy Pop wishes his old Stooges were good enough to even be the roadies for the Stones, much less write something that good.  And as for &quot;Let it Bleed&quot;?  With Stu on the piano, this track is about as good as the Stones got.  &quot;You got the Silver&quot; is Keith at his open tuning best, and &quot;Love in Vain&quot; is the Stones as old bluesmen that no rock band could hope to match.  Those 5 tracks never made it to FORTY LICKS like the great &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; but they helped define the reason that the Rolling Stones started calling themselves the &quot;greatest rock n roll band in the world&quot; on tour later that year.
0062502174|5.0|The Alchemist is a fairy tale - a new fable reminding its reader of the simple lessons of life along the way.  The young shepherd is a boy in search of his Personal Legend, his dream, and his place in this life.  He learns to pay attention to the world around him, and to use this attention to detail to help him make his own decisions.   Above all, he listens to his heart.  He understands that foresight is not a gift.<br />It's an awesome novel that will take just a few hours of your time, but remind you that life is easier to understand when you pay attention and you follow your heart.  I will read The Alchemist again.
B000000W5N|5.0|The casual Stones fan who owns FORTY LICKS may think he's got all the best Stones tracks covered.  But not if he doesn't own these tracks: &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Mile.&quot; Sure, the great &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; gets its deserved attention, and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; is one of the best Stones ballads ever (somehow left off their 1969 LET IT BLEED release.) But &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; doesn't get the attention it warrants, as perhaps the BEST Stones ballad ever released. (With &quot;Ruby Tuesday,&quot; &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; &quot;As Tears Go By,&quot; &quot;Angie,&quot; &quot;Play with Fire,&quot; and &quot;Fool to Cry&quot; as other obvious greats.) It's a haunting builder with strings included, and released the same year as Zep's &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, I never understood why it didn't become a classic the same way.  As for &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking,&quot; it showcases the '70s Stones (with Bobby Keyes, Mick Taylor, and Stu) and what made them different and better than their peers, Led Zeppelin and the Who. The Stones could be a little bit Zep, a bit Santana, a bit Creedence, a bit Allmans, and mix it all together in their unique way.  I put STICKY FINGERS right behind LET IT BLEED as the best the Stones ever had to offer.
0920668372|5.0|I remember having this book read in my Older Adults class and found it very heart-warming.  It never once dawned on me that it was inappropriate or creepy.  I was so disappointed to read some of the comments made by the other readers who thought it was so \\"creepy\\".  The \\"Well-Adjusted Mom,\\" was so insensitive to say that she would not have it read at someones funeral after one of the readers said she had in read at her son's.  I understand that everyone has their own opinions, but at least be sensitive to someone else's personal tragedy that found this book comforting in times of sorrow.  I would recommend this book to anyone...young and old.  It is about a parents love for their children.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book when I was in elementary school.  I am now a sophmore in college, and have brought my copy with me- my roommate has her's too.  The Giver is one of the first books that really made me think about the world and wonder about the fairness of it all.  This isn't just a children's book.  Anyone can find pleasure in it because it never gets old!
B00005T30L|4.0|yes i admit to hating Thora Birch. the reason i watched this was because Steve Buscemi was in it and he was great in this movie. this movie is really funny and i have a question. does anyone know who played the karate dude?
B00008OLYN|5.0|I once fell victim to the adherrence that all Opeth albums must contain darkness and light.  At that time I recall thinking that &quot;Damnation&quot; was a good but unusual addition to the magnificent Opeth canon.  While it certainly is not my personal favorite CD of theirs, how could I not give this outstanding CD 5 stars?  It's great to hear these guys branching out and exploring new avenues of musical expression.  The production is extraordinary, via Steve Wilson.  The instrumentation is both dynamic and emotional, their impressive talent evident on each track.  What else could I possibly add to elevate the lofty grandeur of Opeth?  This is another fine chapter in their grand career. Another superb CD.
048622709X|5.0|There are two excellent books that I know of that focus specifically on the anatomy of the hand for the artist. I was given this book early in my aspiring art career by my grandmother (an accomplished artist) but lost it some while later. I had forgotten the title and ended up buying Hogarth's &quot;Drawing Dynamic Hands&quot; as a guide after failed attempts to locate this book again. I would actually recommend getting them both, but start with this book first. In the end I got alot out of both, but there were many times using the Hogarth book that I missed &quot;Hundred Hands&quot;.<br />Hogarth's style of illustration in all of his books is much more imbellished by his use of soft shading to illustrate volume. His look is extremely useful but it can also be an obstacle to a beginning to intermediate student since end result is a more stylized appearance. With Hogarth's books, the student can find themselves inadvertently adopting the look of his images in their own style. <br />Bridgeman's illustrations are much more loose and sketch-like. He uses little or no shading but his understanding of volume and structure rivals Hogarth's. The simplicity of his examples are much easier to get started with. He accomplishes just as much if not more with a few loose lines as Hogarth's vivid shading. More importantly the sketch-like quality can be much less intimidating early on.<br />While it's true Hogarth's book is definitely nicer to look at, I believe Bridgeman's is a much better learning guide for starters. The price of this book also makes it affordable to use them as compliments to one another if you decide get both.
B000002JKA|3.0|To all the people who like Prog. Rock.-- Just because music is different doesn't mean its good. I'm not saying that all different and prog. bands suck-- I love bands such as Primus and many songs from Genesis and Yes. It's just when i listen to a CD like Awake, i get bored. Many of the songs are 6 minutes+. Many of the parts in the songs sound like they belong in a disney movie, such as some parts in Voices. They have talent, but they should produce more shorter songs to keep more people (yes i know that have many fans, but people like me) interested.
0676973779|5.0|All I can say is you simply MUST read this book!  It is unique, spiritual, humourous, and heart-breaking.  It will melt you and make you want more.......I love this book!   LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
0790729393|5.0|Sleepers is a phenominal movie that shows a group of boys growing up and the loyalty they have for each other. All they have is each other and their neighborhood. They protect each other and witness the protection of their neighborhood. The book is one of the best written and the movie follows suit with the spectacular word for word narration of Jason Patric which seems pull the movie into the classic realm. Pay particular attention to the acting job done by Robert Deniro. This is quite possibly his best acting job to date. A good movie with great acting in a well presented package. A+
B00006AW2J|5.0|I don't know why people are knocking the new SACD releases of the earlier Stones' albums.  First of all, they are stereo (right/left front speakers), so there is no multichannel playback.  However, it is my belief that these older recordings (as well as those of the Beatles, etc.) are meant for stereo only.  What's the point of surround?  Multichannel SACDs only make sense for live music and for highly composed bands like Pink Floyd, where there are many subtle layers and textures.  For evidence of this look no further than the Dark Side of The Moon multichannel SACD.  In the case of the Stone's, there is no added value in a multichannel mix.  This is the same reason why the Bob Dylan SACDs are stereo (with a few multichannel exceptions.)  Second, while the sound could be better, these are without a doubt the best remastered versions available.  Nothing is perfect.  Do yourself a favor and buy as many of these Stones' SACDs as you can.  An excellent place to start, especially for newer fans, is the Hot Rocks 1964-1971 double-SACD set.  Simply fantastic.
6305128952|4.0|I love this movie sooo much I thought it was so moving. The love story the scenery, THE HORSES! Almost everything about it was just perfect. The one thing I did not find perfect was how they dealed with Scarlet Johansons horse. Robert Redford had no gift as far as I could see. Almost every method he used was the usual way of breaking a horse western style. Now they can do it that way, but you can do it much kinder and gentler and find the same results. If they wanted him to seem like a real Horse Whisperer They should have used Monty Roberts methods...He has a real gift. Now with all that aside I think everything else they portrayed with the horses was great and even though I dont agree with what Robert Redford was doing in the movie, I believe he Played the part well. Plus the end Result...when Scarlet Johansons character was able to ride again really gives you a good feeling. I really loved music as well it really came together with the movie. All and all I liked this movie so much I cried at the end (which I have only done in this movie and cold mountain...in otherwords I dont cry...EVER!) and afterwards I wanted to see it again right away.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is pretty good, but they cut way too much out to get a PG-13 and to keep it short so they could get it on more movie screens and make more money opening weekend. The movie is thus good, but uneven as a result. Plenty of killer moments, and a great cast make this version definitely worth watching, but the coming Directors Cut will be much better and I can't wait.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|American IV: The Man Comes Around is a must have CD.<BR>It is also available with the Hurt video included and that's the version I'd suggest that you get. <BR>I bought it without the video and then had to turn around and buy it again.<BR>The video for Hurt is a magnificent tribute to Cash and Amazon.com has both versions of The Man Comes Around CD at good prices.
0441172717|5.0|This book is great.  Its got a good story that explores many political principles through a sci-fi atmosphere.  If you are a sci-fi fan, pick it up.
0385504209|1.0|After all the media acclaim and recommendations from friends, I was really looking forward to reading this book.  And was *sorely* disappointed.  In the first place, I think Katherine Neville, Umberto Eco and others have dealt with the subject matter much more skillfully - not to mention coherently.  And in the second place, I found it to be simply a poorly written novel.  Yes, I admit that it's plot devices were entertaining but the book is one plot device after another with absolutely no character development.  The novel's ending I found to be ridiculous and to render the entire novel pointless.
0805062971|4.0|This book is almost word for word with the movie...the ending is different though so fans should check out at least the last few chapters.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Train of Thought may not be Dream Theater's high-point of their carrer, but it comes damn close. Train of Thought is not much of a prog album, but more metal. The songs are long, the riffs fast and dirty, and James LiBrie's vocals match the songs perfectly. The highlights of this little album are &quot;Honor Thy Father, Endless Sacrifice, This Dying Soul and In The Name of God&quot; Each one is a monster, ripping and tearing through the minds of people who can enjoy such a good effort by the best band out there today. Nothing will ever match DT's &quot;Images and Words&quot; or their &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; but it can come close. Train of Thought does that. One of the best metal albums out there today.
1573225517|3.0|If you are like me, you somtimes hate the way directors take a story and mutilate it with their own version of a script.  I watched High Fidelity, the movie before I read the book, but half way through I realized that it is the exact same as the movie.  My recomendation is to save the time laboring over the British slang in the book and watch the movie which is an Americanized version of the same thing.
0800177177|2.0|It begins well.  By connecting Dracula the vampire with the historic Vlad Dracula (1431-1476), also known as Vlad Tepes (&quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot;), the film promises quite a lot.  The special effects in the opening are not so much bad as they are stylized; Coppola's stated intent was to invoke the techniques of classic silent cinema.  I bought it.<br />But then Keannu Reeves showed up and everything went south in a hurry.  It's not his fault; he is an actor of limited range.  His Neo in The Matrix works.  His Jonathon Harker doesn't - even for a moment.  Neither does Winona Ryder's Mina. Her presence is too slight to hold the screen. Gary Oldman is a fine actor, but in the presence of an overly indulgent director (as he had here), tends to go over the top.  His Dracula should have felt quite sated on all the scenery he mercilessly feasted upon.  And, finally, the much-praised Anthony Hopkins - another fine actor - chose to phone in his Van Helsing as though he were impersonating the character for a group of attentive children.<br />Bram Stoker's Dracula's fatal flaw, though, is its screenplay.  The &quot;reimagining&quot; of the relationship between Dracula and Mina as star-crossed lovers seeking each other across the barriers of time and death is just silly.  Not that the whole concept of the Vampire isn't, mind you, but that's a level of silliness we're willing to buy into when we watch a Dracula film in the first place.  Stoker's Dracula was a thoroughly malignant character. Vastly intelligent and noble though he was, let's not forget he was based on a sadistic 15th century Wallachian prince who got his jollies impaling thousands of people on pikes - usually through the most painful orifice you can think of!  This film turns him into a weepy, sentimental type whose villainous actions are pardonable because they are fueled by his search for True Love.  Ick!  Does anybody who knows anything about the real Vlad Tepes (who the film has defintely established as our hero) really believe this possible?<br />Despite this bizarre shift in the Dracula-Mina dynamic, the film then works very hard to include everything - absolutely everything - from the book, by compressing it to the point where anyone who went to the bathroom in its thatrical run might well have missed the equivalent of 150 pages of the novel. Lucy didn't actually need three suitors, dramatically speaking. By including them, what we get is two too many characters with nothing to do but stand around and look chivalrous.  That's why the process of turning a novel into a screenplay is called &quot;adaptation&quot;.  It would have been better to take a lesson from other tellings of the story: chuck what you don't really need, then polish and pace what's essential until it works dramatically.<br />The art-direction and cinematography in Bram Stoker's Dracula is first-rate, without ever being really appropriate.  There is a distincly Japanese flavor to the design work that, while striking, is completely at odds with the period and place.  And Coppola's camera style, so disciplined and unerring in films like The Godfather and Apocalypse Now!, is ludicrously overwrought here.  The film looks like a two-hour music video - and a mediocre one at that.<br />The definitive film version of Dracula has yet to be made.  It is a classic novel, without quite acending to the status of classic literature.  As such, it requires fairly liberal adaptation, but an equal measure of respect for Bram Stoker's integrity in its telling.  He was in top form with Dracula, and spun a crackling good yarn.  His best work deserves better film-making.r hero) really believe this possible?  <br />Despite this bizarre shift in the Dracula-Mina dynamic, the film then works very hard to include everything - absolutely everything - from the book, by compressing it to the point where anyone who went to the bathroom in its thatrical run might well have missed the equivalent of 150 pages of the novel.

0767830555|5.0|And I mean that, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially to ganster movie lovers.  Although this isn't really a &quot;gangster movie&quot;, it does appeal to the same crowd.  Great movie, and really good acting from DeNiro as Travis.  This is one of the greatest movies of all time, please do yourself a favor and buy a copy!
B00005JMGL|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as much as my chldren did!  It was like \\"Peter Pan Meets the Pirates of the Carribean\\"--much more exciting than the Disney cartoon!  There is some violence (Captain Hook is a bad guy, afterall), but it isn't dwelt on, and didn't bother my kids at all.<br />A very good movie, indeed!
B00005AXEL|4.0|After the abysmal 1994 album, Street Angel, Stevie Nicks waited 7 years before her next solo release.  What we get is a more stripped-down, older, and wiser Stevie, with the same emotional and personal lyrics her fans have grown to love.  Stevie brings in Sheryl Crow (who produces some of the tracks), Sarah McLachlan, Macy Gray, Lindsey Buckingham, and Natalie Mains as guest artists.  The only true duet is with Maines, on the country-tinged &quot;Too Far From Texas.&quot;  Stand-out tracks include the title cut, Love Is, Bombay Sapphires, and Sorcerer.  There are a few throw-aways here (Love Changes, That Made me Stronger), but overall, solid work and perhaps her best album since Bella Donna.
0790734850|5.0|Truley one of the best film noirs ever made. This breathtaking film takes place in the curruption of 1940s Hollywood with an unforgettable cast including Danny DeVito, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, and James Cromwell and a marvelous direction by Cutis Hanson. This movie should not be missed by anyone especially by movie buffs it is a truley remarkable film.
0156027321|4.0|That was exactly how I felt once I finished reading this book. Started with a curious child story finding the meaning of life, reminded myself that I once was practising Buddhism and Christianity at the same time.<br />Nicely crafted piece of work, with 'Pi' as a castaway, reminded me how strong human courage and spirit can be.<br />Nicely twisted piece of work, with animals as his companions in the lifeboat, ended with clever replica of the story with human companions, leaves you pondering which one is true, flipping through the book cover, wondering if it's based on true story or fiction.
B00009RDG9|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro are great actors and they don't fall short in this film.Problem is the script is so botched in this crazy caper that its sort of hard to enjoy until the end where it makes up for the times it messed up earlier in the movie.Del Toro plays Aaron Hallam who is haunted by the nightmares of killings in Kosovo and has became a rouge special forces assasin.Jones plays L.T.Bonham who trained Aaron along time ago and now feels as if it is his responsibilty to catch Aaron and put an end to the murders.The film has a pretty good start but eventually begins to drag,making you feel like running to a video store while the movie is still playing,pick up another one and be ready to pop it in by the time the movie ends.<BR>The film really isn't extremely bad but does have some problems that should have been worked out before the release of it.But you know,it is worth the four dollars you pay to rent it.C- for the movie,B- for the acting.Enjoy!!!
B000089RVX|2.0|...But you'll be better off just getting the single \\"Bring Me To Life\\".  The followup stuff is about as exciting as Heart in the mid 1980's- not very. \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is a great song I will give them that.  But the clown that sings with Amy kind of ruins it.  It would have been one the coolest songs in rock had they instead used Ozzy Osbourne in his place.  The guy doing it makes me and my 16 year old little bro laugh our asses of everytime he says something during the song.  And we haven't laughed so hard since Sheryl Crowe did \\"Picture\\" with Kid Rock.
B000005JA8|5.0|So much has been said about this album that it`d be hard to write a review on it without rehashing points that have already been made a thousand times before. But I`ll give it a shot.<br />\\"Trout Mask Replica\\" is one of the hardest albums to listen to that has ever been released. Even if you want to like it and are well accquianted with other \\"weird\\" music, the first spin of this album will likely have you wondering why you didn`t just spend that 15 bucks on another Zappa album. Of the twenty-five tracks (not counting the a capella poetry numbers), a scant few even come close to falling within the bounds of conventional rock music (Moonlight, Poppy and debatably Sugar N` Spikes). The rest of the album will almost certainly sound like totally disjointed nonsense unless you know how to listen to it. Basically, there`s a bass and two guitars, and occasionally some horns, and on most tracks at least two of these will be playing seemingly unrelated parts in completely different time signatures, and if you try to listen to it all at once you won`t pick up any of it. The key is to single out one instrument and listen to the way it goes with the drums (Which, contrary to popular belief, are not played by the Mascara Snake but by John French, who deserves to be mentioned alongside Keith Moon and Mitch Mitchell for his ability to handle a band like this), then move on to another. Once you know what each musician is doing seperately then you can listen to the music as a whole, and then the album lives up to every bit of hype it`s gained over the years. <br />Genre-wise, \\"Trout Mask\\" owes much more to jazz and blues than it does to rock. What makes listening to it such a rewarding experience is when you pick up on one incredible guitar line or rhythm part buried amid the chaos (which is present even after you`ve figured it out), and unlike 99% of rock music where you`ll be beaten over the head with it for the rest of the song, here the band will often repeat it for only four bars or so before shifting over to something else. Going into a track-by-track breakdown would take up much more space than you`re allowed for reviews on Amazon, but believe the other reviewers who say it takes about 4-6 spins (during which time you basically have to be listening to the album and doing nothing else) before you really appreciate it.<br />One reviewer said something to the effect that he listens to this album maybe once a year, but on that one occasion nothing else will do. Truly, this is an album that can be hard on the ears even after you`ve grown to love it (i.e., this is not good background music), but the impact it delivers is something no other album comes close to matching. That`s not even to say that this is my favorite album, (although I`d easily put it in my Top 20 I personally prefer Beefheart`s debut \\"Safe as Milk\\") but \\"Trout Mask\\" is a record for which there is no precedent or parallel (not to mention the immeasurable influence it had on future musicians, everyone from Tom Waits to The Clash to Nirvana), and it`s level of innovation puts it on a short list of the most important recordings of the 20th century.
B00000ILDE|5.0|If you're searching for a high speed, low drag super action thriller, search no more because &quot;Aliens&quot; is the film you're looking for!  Even if you've not seen the first movie, &quot;Alien&quot; you'll still be able to enjoy this film to the fullest.  That was of course by the design of the producers and this films superb director, James Cameron.  Few sequels ever out do or exceed the accomplishments of their predecessors but &quot;Aliens&quot; can certainly be counted among those select few!  With an exceptional script and an extremely talented cast, James Cameron crafted one of the best films to have ever graced the silver screen and the home theater screen.<br />Few films raise the blood pressure such as this one does as James Cameron and crew crafted a film that excels in all points, from intense suspense to breakneck pace in action.  What's even better is that this film bears many viewings; I can't even begin to remember how many times I've watched this extraordinary film.  The VHS tape I had for the film died long ago and this review is for the June of 99 DVD release that has long since completely sold out prompting the latest DVD release!<br />If you've watched more than one James Cameron film, you might begin to notice a bit of a recurring pattern as far as the exceptional actors that always seem to make it into his films, time after time.  &quot;Aliens&quot; of course stars Sigourney Weaver in the role that has made her a household name and her performance for this film is extraordinary to say the least.  Chief among the Cameron cronies (meant in a nice way of course) are Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen and Jenette Goldstein who all perform brilliantly in this film and can be found in many of his other exceptional films.  Also of note in &quot;Aliens&quot; is the dramatic role for Paul Reiser, a genre he's long since abandoned for comedy but his performance is quite memorable.<br />Director James Cameron also wrote the script for &quot;Aliens&quot; along with David Giler and Walter Hill, all of which deserve all of the accolades they've received and continue to receive for their work on this incredible film.  Few directors capture the imagination as he does.  Of note also is James Horner, who was responsible for the score and the work he did on this film turned out to be quite exceptional, as is usual, whenever his name appears in the credits, the film is usually a huge success.   <br />Just a note on the &quot;Space Marines&quot; featured in this extraordinary film, from a present day soldier's point of view.  No matter what happens in the future, I seriously doubt that the Marine Corps would ever adopt wearing US Army rank insignia on their uniforms.  I'm sure that many a present day Marines has had their feathers rustled a bit upon noticing this minor error in costume design.<br />The Premise:<br />It is nearly sixty years after the conclusion of &quot;Alien,&quot; Ripley and Jonesy the cat are still quite happily sleeping away in their cryo-freeze compartment aboard the shuttle after sending the first alien out the airlock.  The film opens with a salvage crew opening up the shuttle and finding her and the cat!  After she's awoken, she learns that she's been floating around for fifty seven years and the company she works for is none to sympathetic to her cause, basically blackballing her.  Unbeknownst to her, the &quot;company&quot; sends someone out to investigate her story and not too long thereafter nobody from the planetoid is heard from again.  This of course prompts the company to send the space marines and Ripley as an advisor to find out what happened to the terraformers...<br />What follows from there is one of the best and most intense Sci-Fi action/thrillers to have ever been made and I would highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films in this genre!<br />This review is for the June of 99 DVD release.  I found that the THX and 5.1 Surround worked quite well for this film.  The seventeen minutes of the restored footage for this film is quite seamlessly added to film and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of this movie.  <br />With reference to the latest release, I would definitely recommend that version if you don't already have a copy, especially if you're into a lot of the Special Features.  While the version I'm reviewing today seems a bit sparse in the special features area, the new release appears to be replete with them, making it a very wise purchase.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Behind the Scenes Footage<BR>-Interview with James Cameron<BR>-Still Photo Section<BR>-Original Theatrical Trailer
B00009V7P8|5.0|I heard Volcano on the radio and instantly fell in love with it.  I didn't know the artist or song name and spent weeks on a desparate search to locate the information.  I finally found this CD and can't get enough.<br />Unlike many pop artists today, Damien's CD &quot;O&quot; is very diverse, offering a range of intensity, instruments, and speed.  His female vocalists have haunting voices, but they do not sing on all of the tracks.  The string arrangements are fantastic, offering a nice contrast to some of the more &quot;edgy&quot; songs.  There are 2 tracks which are I didn't care for, but I respect Damien for pushing the artistic limits in those songs.  By far, this CD is the best new one I've heard since Norah Jones' debut album.

B0000C6E4D|1.0|Sarah's latest album &quot;Afterglow&quot; is one of 2003's worst albums. There is no good reason to buy this album. Don't be fooled by the first single &quot;Fallen&quot;, which might give the illusion that this album is worth anything. There is only 2 decent songs on this 10 song album: Fallen and Stupid. Ladies and Gentlemen do yourselves a favor and save your money.
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar is one of the most moving and enlightening novels I have ever had the pleasure to read.  Her honesty and patience in relating such personal (and obviousely autobiograohical) events is startling and hugely admirable.  <br />The compassion it evokes in the reader is deeply powerful but the relationship it establishes with the reader is even more powerful and it will sit on your bookshelf  for decades to come like an old, reassuring friend.  I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B000000993|4.0|I've been a Tool fan for years, and this is what started it. When I was about 13, I saw the video for \\"Sober\\" on MTV, and like millions of others, that was my introduction. Over the years, form Undertow to Aenema and Lateralus, Tool seems to get more complex and progressive. Being that this is their second release and first LP, it's very basic, sort of a link between heavy grunge and metal. \\"Intolerance\\", \\"Prison Sex\\", the classic \\"Sober\\", \\"Swamp Song\\", and the title track are all pretty simple but still pack a punch. However they also go into experiments like the spoken word of Henry Rollins (\\"Bottom\\"), Eastern-tinged harmonic-minor riffs (\\"4 Degrees\\"), and mind-warp psychadelia (\\"Disgustipated\\"). While I prefer the complicated stuff, this is still a damn fine metal album and a invaluable part of the Tool discography.
0312995423|3.0|For a first book this is very good. But having read the Da Vinci Code first, this book clearly deserves 1 or 2 stars less. While the plot is a page-turner, it is not very deep and could've been about 100 pages shorter. In the middle of the book the story slows down and adds too many non-key elements. I will still read Brown's other books hoping he only improved from this good start.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The great thing about a band like A Perfect Circle is that it gives talented and successful musicians carte blanche to put whatever kind of music they want to create out on the market and have it be accepted as experimental and progressive, yet still sell some records. While APC isn't as complex as Tool, there is a thicker sense of atmosphere exuded from Tool/APC voacalist Maynard James Keenan, and the songwriting is much more coherent and focused, mainly due to the fine composing and arranging skills of guitarist/writer Billy Howerdel. <br />Track by track, here's how it breaks down:<br />&quot;The Package&quot;, 4/5 - The sludgy, murky tug and pull of the song kicks off a feeling of dread from the first note. The rolling drums, clean electric guitars, and a shaman-like wail from Maynard slowly buildup to the breaking point. Only problem with it is that near the end, it tends to drag on.<br />&quot;Weak And Powerless&quot;, 3/5 - Starts with a pretty bass line in 12/8, and then kinda disappoints. The vocals and lyrics are good but not great, and the song is pretty straightforward and bland, with no real intense emotions. Listen to it once in a while.<br />&quot;The Noose&quot;, 5/5 - A lot of people go on and on about what an amazing song this is, and they couldn't be more right. This is true progressive music, not in the sense of solos and time changes, but in just a completely different approach to songwriting, dynamics, instrumentation, and melody. If this song lasted forever, I truly wouldn't care. <br />&quot;Blue&quot;, 4/5 - A VERY Tool-sounding track, this sounds like the lost track from Lateralus. A slow, cathartic build into a great melodic chorus that comes across as both angry and yearning.<br />&quot;Vanishing&quot;, 2/5 - The first bad song on the record, it's just boring and redundant, and never really goes anywhere. Skip it. <br />&quot;A Stranger&quot;, 5/5 - There is no way in hell that Tool could get away with writing something like this. A beautiful ballad consisting of acoustic guitar, strings, and an emotional yet reserved Maynard. The last little vocal part (&quot;...shy away, shy away, phantom...&quot;) is undoubtedly one of the high points of Maynard's career.<br />&quot;The Outsider&quot;, 4/5 - Very similar to &quot;Blue&quot;, this is a heavy tune with suicide-laced lyrics which Maynard delivers in his patented Tool bark and his high-octave cry. The emotion in this song has to be heard to be believed.<br />&quot;Crimes&quot;, 1/5 - Well, this is pointless. A drum beat and Maynard counting to ten. No thanks.<br />&quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;, 6/5 - Gorgeous. The beautiful arranging and etheral instrumentation goes wonderfully with Maynard crooning the first downright love song in years. Had it been released in the fifties it would have been a great song, but the fact that APC not only tries, but succeeds in pulling it off today deserves a tremendous amount of respect. A Perfect Circle, thank you for giving me and the woman I love a song which we both connect to so heavily.<br />&quot;Pet&quot;, 2/5 - Sadly, after the above song, the album goes pretty downhill. It's heavy and kind of sounds like Tool, but once again, the song just doesn't really go anywhere, and never really gets anything across. <br />&quot;Lullaby&quot;, 2/5 - Not a song, but a drum beat and Swans vocalist Jarboe crooning. Not great, but as far as filler goes, it's a hell of a lot better than &quot;Crimes&quot;.<br />&quot;Gravity&quot;, 3/5 - A lot of people say this song is fantastic, but I think it's just alright. It's in 7/4 with a good performance by Maynard, but it's still not one of the best songs on here.<br />Worth the price of admission.
0385504209|4.0|I had a very good time reading this book. I am fascinated by puzzles, word games and cyphers, and I have more respect for history and science than for blind religion. Therefore this book met all of my expectations. The author's style is particular (many very short chapters) but it fits the style of the story and it didn't bother me (unlike other reviewers). And the fact that the book (cover) contains a bunch of extra information you wouldn't expect (check out the book's web site) did feed my hunger for more puzzles and games. This book is close to the best you can get. Why not the best ? Because the author sometimes seems to add too much non-fiction (information) that is not enough related to the plot, just for the purpose of showing how much research he did - though the research is likely limited to the list of books included in the story. He should've avoided this pitfall, and the book would've been the best.
0688163173|5.0|This is one of the better books I've read in the past 2 years and I average about a book a week!  This is my first introduction to Dennis Lehane and I am pleased that I listened to my friend who recommended it.  It's an easy read. Great escapism.  Make the time for this one, you won't be disappointed.
0738206679|2.0|I had received this book from a friend, and my expectations were high, too high.<br />The book starts good, but it runs out of gas about halfway, when the author keeps repeating the same theories over and over again, just trying to get enough 'search keywords&quot; in his book to get more hits on book search engines.<br />Also, it is too obvious that it is written by a theoretical scientist, not an observational one. Once he has an idea of how his theory 'should' be, he is just adding enough components and factors to his formula to prove that the reality is exactly like his theory. A scientist should sometimes accept that he's not able to explain what he sees. The author was to proud to get to that stage.<br />I also agree with some other reviewers that the author does a great job promoting his own accomplishments, 'en passant' slapping in the face of government agencies for not granting him money for his research.<br />Overall, the book would have been better at about 100 page instead of 226.<br />I stuggled through the book, but it was a big effort, and I did it only because I received the book and promised to discuss it. If my expectations had been lower, I would have appreciated this more.<br />I am very interested by the subject, but will have to look for the better books about it.
B00005JM20|2.0|I am a fan of Rowan Atkinson, but after watching Johnny English, I am convinced that Rowan Atkinson is funnier when he relies upon his gifts in the realm of physical comedy.  Given, when his voice is disembodied from him (as it was in his role in Disney's Lion King), he is certainly enjoyable to listen to.  The film left me with a disconnect, however, between his refined British accent and the physical comedy he tried to pull off in JE.   <br />Unlike his Black Adder character, whose pratfalls are simply comedic justice being served for his character's devious conniving, JE is portrayed as a person trying earnestly to be a good secret agent but who &quot;cocks up&quot; nearly every endeavor.<br />While the film gives the viewer a few good laughs, anyone looking for the uproariously funny exploits of a Mr. Bean episode will be sadly disappointed.  <br />The plot is weak, and seems only to be a vehicle to get the viewer to the next gag.  Character development is virtually nonexistent, and the use of the supporting cast is irregular.  The viewer leaves the movie wondering what really transpired between JE and Natalie Imbruglia's beautiful but poorly developed secret agent.  Similarly, the character of Bough is unevenly dispersed throughout the film whenever a gag needs a &quot;straight man&quot; for effect.  In fact, all of the characters, including Malkovich's villanous Frenchman, are very static throughout.  If you're looking for character arcs here, don't.  In fact, bring a level, because the characterizations in the film are quite flat.<br />The few sight gags that are on-target in the film are not exploited for their full comedic value, while others that were not that funny to begin with are revisited ad nauseum.  In short, the movie zigs when it should zag, thereby failing to live up to its comedic potential.  If this is your first brush with Rowan Atkinson, know that he is capable of being much funnier than he winds up demonstrating in this film.  Watch a seasonof Black Adder, check out Mr. Bean on DVD, or even witness Atkinson in a supporting role in &quot;Rat Race&quot; and you will get a better sense of his unique brand of physical comedy and have a much heartier laugh.
B00007L4LL|4.0|Kate & Leopold is shot through with nonsensical holes and goofs on every time travel plot level -- in no small part, it seems, because of eleventh hour editing after focus group previews for inadvertent unsavory implications in the plot resolution -- and still the comic fabric hangs beautifully to thoroughly delight guilty feminine (and geeky) pleasures.  Without all the holes and goofs, 5 stars would be in order and Hugh Jackman would have won his Golden Globe nomination for best actor -- and the film would have been nominated for more Oscars than just music.  \\"That I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel.\\"  \\"And what, pray tell, did The Great Disappointment say?\\"  \\"You're a trip, Lionel.\\"  Great and easily forgiven contrived screenplay, greatly endearing comic timing and acting (with just enough physical slapstick), great casting down to the lanky dog Bart who fits right into the sort of  \\"loose and lanky\\" (yet compelling) feel of the film.  (Hunks Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber positively delight.)  \\"If a man washes a dish and no one sees it, did it happen?\\"  \\"I suggest you pick the poop up,\\" for love is a leap through time and space, chivalry need not be dead and Kate & Leopold is an intelligent sleeper that should be among the 100 Greatest Romantic Comedies of All Time.
0780622553|4.0|If you're into the darker side of sci-fi, you will probably enjoy this foray into pseudo-reality.  Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow), this was somewhat of a sleeper film that encouraged viewers to question their reality a full year before Matrix-mania hit the silver screen. <br />Although the film lacks the action or pizzaz of The Matrix, certain parallels between the two films are inevitable due to the aspect of humans being controlled by an outside force (in this case, a race of aliens inhabiting the bodies of deceased humans) and not even being aware of it.  The visual feel of the film is totally different from the Matrix, however, as Proyas takes chooses a low-key, seedy art-deco look for his film as opposed to the Matrix's brighter, monochromatic post-modern aura.<br />Some relatively big names participate in the cast, although curiously, not in the lead role.  Relative unknown Rufus Sewell plays the lead role effectively although not spectacularly, while William Hurt, a pre-Beautiful Mind Jennifer Connelly, and a pre-24 Kiefer Sutherland round out the cast in this well-written and directed feature.  <br />Although the situations are about as far removed from reality as one can get, the viewer empathizes with the main character's confusion and rejoices in the revelation that he has the ability to liberate captive humanity from its oppressors.  A fine film, and one worth a repeat viewing now and again.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I love this film. The artwork and animation are breathtaking, the songs are delightful, and the voice work is right on. Kathryn Beaumont is the quintessential Alice! <br />Most of these Amazon reviews on Disney's version are like the Wonderland creatures; some of them are brimming with joy and exuberance, and others are self-important, pompous, mean-spirited and negatively nonsensical, and unnecessarily so!  <BR> <BR>It's a shame that people persist on comparing this film to the book, or to Snow White, or to The Wizard of Oz. It would be nice to be open-minded enough to accept this film on its OWN terms, and perhaps therein lies the secret to enjoying it.  Unfortunately, not all of us are interesting in trying!<br />I'm getting the 2-disc Masterpiece Edition, just because IT IS.
0887307396|5.0|We used this book as a template for defining our strategic vision and corporate culture for a 75 person growing tech company.  The insights on building a company for the long-term are simple but valuable and practical.  I recommend it highly.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Honestly, I don't follow hype. No one ever said to me, &quot;Linkin Park ROCKS!!! LISTEN TO THEM!!!&quot; I just picked up Hybrid Theory and loved it. This band rocks. Seriously. As for Meteora- this CD is possibly the single greatest album ever made. Any song, in my opinion, could be taken at random and played on radio, etc. as a &quot;single&quot; (though I didn't really like Nobody's Listening). Some people claim Linkin Park isn't good or that they take their sound from other bands, but in reality they have crafted their own unique style that sets them apart from other groups.<br />LINKIN PARK ROCKS!!! LISTEN TO THEM!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Really liked this cd it's good to listen to when you're cruising in your car and just wanna feel free.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Big Fish is a wonderful film. Tim Burton's visual style is as amzing as usual. The colors he uses to set the scenes put right there beside the character. And what a wonderful story concept, a story about stories. The characters have personality and realism. A beautiful, well-acted film. Keep it up, Tim, because I'm aiming for you to increase the size of my favorites list!
B00004WLXZ|5.0|The Nazi regime is over now, but this 1934 film remains and is available on DVD.  It was commissioned by Adolph Hitler himself and written and directed by Leni Riefenstal, then only 32 years old.  It's a full two-hours and celebrates and glorifies the Third Reich.  The film techniques are excellent, given the technology of the time.  I understand she used 30 cameras, more than a hundred crewmembers and 61 hours of film.  There are shots obviously taken from a helicopter with great views of the clouds.  There are distant shots that take in more than 200,000 people.  And close-ups that show the love and adoration that the populace felt for Hitler, who had just become the dictator the year before.  I<br />Mostly, there are crowd scenes and speeches by Hitler himself as well as Goebbels, Goring, Hess, Himmler and other villains of the Nazi era which was then a rising political movement.  It was several years before the war machine was fully in place as the Nazis didn't march into Poland until 1939.  So, at the time the film was made, there was nothing but joy, especially since just a few years prior to that Germany was immersed in a depression that was so bad that people were paid twice a day because the value of money changed  from hour to hour that the price of a loaf of bread could double from morning to afternoon.<br />It's an eerie feeling to sit in the comfort of my rocking chair and travel seven decades back in time.  The young people in the Hitler Youth movement reminded me of boy scouts as I watched them horse around and splash water on each other like any other high-spirited teenagers.  The small children are all smiling as their parents hold them up to catch a glimpse of Hitler.  And the adults themselves seems to be in an ecstatic trance as they raise their arms in a &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; salute.  I couldn't help but think if any of them are still alive, and how deceived they must be about the early promise of their youth, and how much devastation it caused for everyone.<br />Then there were the speeches, always with the utmost theatrical fervor.  I read the subtitles carefully.  What was Hitler and the others really saying?  Yes, they spoke of glory.  But they also spoke of themselves as being the party of peace and being told by God that this was their destiny.  Surprisingly too, they all seemed to believe it.  I had also expected to see more anti-Semitism in their speeches.  Jews were never mentioned and although there was some reference to racial purity, it didn't seem to be the leading issue in 1934.<br />Basically, the film was one big show of pageantry and pep rally for what would come later.  Looking back on in in 2003, it gives me the chills.<br />For students of history, this is an important film.  Others will be horrified.  And many will be bored as there are no actors and no plot except to glorify their leader.d for everyone.<br />Then there were the speeches, always with the utmost theatrical fervor.

B00008J4P5|4.0|Jack White is not your average mainstream rocker. As he proved this past weekend, crazy rock stars still get in barfights, but with this album hes proved that there is still a scent of blues and rolling stones additude in mainstream music. Sure, most \\"true\\" music aficionados would probably put in \\"Never mind the Bollocks\\" by the Sex Pistols before listening to the stripes, but the negative attidude about the singles (Seven Nation Army & others) seems to be deterring potential listeners. <br />All but one or two of the songs have the catchy melodies and grindy distortion that the new punkers of today love, but many songs (Black Math, There's no home for you here) are reminiscient of 60's era rock. My personal favorites are Black Math, Little Acorns, and Girl,...Medicine. Jack, who wrote all of the songs except for the fourth, has an intruiging but simple voice and knows enough chops for guitar. Megis a drummer with hadly any purpose, and I honestly admit that she is a poor drummer for where the stripes are at. <br />Buy this album if you are on your way from the mainsream rock circles to more classic bands such as the Clash, Sex Pistols, etc. It's a good transition.<br />Looking for more blues and less Zeppelin-esque rock? try the Black Keys or the Dirtbombs.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The clarity of the image and sound make this an excellent buy even leaving out the documentary etc on disc two.  A rich cinema experience.
B000006TRV|5.0|Ok, Wow, this is a positively astonishing album. From ''In The Flesh?, all the way to ''Outside The Wall'', This album is a complete masterpiece.Really give this album a listen. Think about the lyrics and the music, that this perfect piece of work provides. It's no wonder it sold 23 million copies globaly.Roger Waters is one of the greatest lyricists to have ever emerged in the music industry.David Gilmour is a fantastic guitarist, nick mason is a very experianced drummer, and rick wright is an unbelievable keybordist.You have to be able to understand the songs completely to get the pure genius flowing off of this record.This should be included in the top ten albums of the twentieth century.Anybody who doesn't have ''The Wall'', should definitly go out and get it now. You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXBK|5.0|After seeing the movie Castle in the Sky I was interested in seeing another of Miyazaki's work, Princess Monoke.  After viewing this movie the only thing I can say is that its simply an amazing masterpiece. The story is very well-paced and the way the story flows you'll become intantly immersed in this world of where man and nature battle for supremacy. When I viewed it last night I could not believe at how good this movie was, it has instantly become one of my favorite movies.  I highly recommend this movie to anime fans and to those who want to see a great movie.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|Big fans of Gregory Maguire's book, we were thrilled to score tickets to see Wicked on Broadway during a short visit to NYC.  What a waste of a good evening!<br />A dark and thought-provoking novel about the cost of being different has been turned into an upbeat, feel-good piece of cotton candy.  Despite terrific efforts by the cast (which you hear on the album), as well as the lighting, set and costume designers, the poor writing shows through.<br />The score is at best pedestrian -- and the lyrics are banal.  But really, all was lost once the creative team decided to change such minor plot points as having the Wicked Witch die (instead, she runs off into the sunset with the Scarecrow) . . . .<br />We found the entire experience painful in the extreme.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I saw the previews for this film and it looked awesome. I couldn't wait to see it, but could never find anyone interested enough to go with me. I finally rented it and was fairly disappointed.<br />The storyline sounds incredible. Werewolves (called \\"Lycans\\" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires? How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept. Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires. Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon. They fight the entire movie with guns. I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade. What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis?<br />Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored. The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights. They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool. The film even refers to them at one point as \\"bats\\" yet you never see it.<br />Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie. The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed. The werewolves from \\"The Howling\\" 20 years ago had better make up.<br />In regards to the DVD, I had a few problems with it.  The film is very dark, mostly shot at night, in tunnels, or in the rain.  The sound was also poorly reproduced on the DVD.  I was constantly having to change the volume.  I would raise it for speech, and as soon as the action started, the sound would jump and I would have to lower it.  I realize something blowing up should sound louder, but not this loud, and the differences shouldn't be so high where I have to keep my finger on the volume button the whole film.<br />The extras on the DVD were fairly boring.  Some throwaways like trailers, teasers for other films, and a storyboard comparison, which no one ever cares about.  It also featured a montage of scenes from the movie set to music called \\"Sights and Sounds.\\"  I don't know what this was or if it was supposed to be entertaining.<br />The featurettes contain a fairly poor \\"Making Of\\" special, a commentary with the director, and a special on the visual effects.<br />Overall, Underworld is a great concept, but the addition of guns and high tech weapons, as well as the idea to turn this into an action film instead of horror, ultimately cause it to fail.  The relationship between Beckinsale and Speedman is never explored beyond a single kiss, even though the film leads you to believe this is another \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" story...t this loud, and the differences shouldn't be so high where I have to keep my finger on the volume button the whole film.  <br />The extras on the DVD were fairly boring.

B00006RAKP|3.0|If you are a casual fan, this is a great collection. If you are a major fan like myself and looking for cleaner mixes of these great classics, BEWARE! Many of these songs are not the full versions! To fit another song on the disc, some songs have been chopped from their original length. Such a shame, this would have been a great collection!
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Great collection, but to make room for some inferior songs from the wilderness years (i.e. the albums Human Touch, Lucky Town and Tom Joad) they left off:  Kitty's Back, For You, 10th Avenue Freezeout, Prove it All Night, Racing in the Streets, Independence Day, Out in the Street, and My Hometown.  I don't think there's much doubt among fans that those are timeless and memorable classics, and should be shared with the newbies who only have found Bruce lately.  The &quot;rarities&quot; disk has some excellent cuts, but others are less compelling, so it might have made more sense to use part of that real estate to fill out his history as well.<br />Quibbling aside, however, if you are looking for a nice best-of Bruce CD to pop into your car stereo, these are just fine.  The first disk especially, which tries and nearly succeeds in encapsulating his classic '73-'82 period, reaffirms that Bruce's songs and performances belong on the same level as the Beatles, Stones, Aretha, Stevie Wonder or whoever you might want to elevate to the top rank.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I'm just really surprised at some of the previous reviews.  Musicians must develop and change their sound and she's grown as a person - of course that's going to influence her music. If it didn't then it wouldn't have meaning.<br />Yes it did take a few listens but doesn't every good album?<br />It's nice to share her journey.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With nearly 500 reviews here, I really can't add much, other than to put in my two cents by saying that this is the single best sci-fi series to ever appear on network TV, and among the very best series whatever the genre.  It's so good, I'm ashamed to say that I did not support the series by watching it when originally appearing on FOX and had to wait for the DVDs to fall in love.  Even for someone who doesn't like most science fiction TV, this series gets my highest recommendation.  Too bad I'm limited to only 5 stars.
B00009P1O0|5.0|This album is NY's Plastic Ono Band or Blood on the Tracks, and <BR>only an artist of such great skill could even make such an honest and poignant statement. First of all, he's telling almost everybody to **** off, critics especially, and that he's come out of his despair and uses his sense of wicked satire, haunting imagery and any other means at his disposal to get his point his across. Walk on is a straight forward rocker telling people who are doggin' him to get on with their petty lives. ...oh baby that's hard to change, I can't tell them how to feel, some get stoned, some get strange, sooner or later it all gets real...Walk on, walk on. It's a very confident, self assured, well crafted tune. <BR>See the Sky About to Rain is a lovely mellontronic melody in which he deftly strikes out at Lynyrd Skynyrd and the South...some are bound to happiness, some are bound to glory, some are bound to live with less, WHO CAN TELL YOUR STORY? Basically saying, Southern Man was right on and there really isn't anything cool about Sweet Home Alabama. Quite moving and well stated; nice uppercut Neil.<BR>Revolution Blues is so bitterly satirical and played with <BR>sheer guts that it would be easy to miss that he's telling all the Laurel Canyon, eclectic effete, that he despises their back stabbing sniping so much that he'd like someone like Charles Manson to just wipe those \\"leper's\\" off the face of the earth, and of course Neil is hardly an advocate of violence, so don't take what he says verbatim.<BR>For the Turnstiles is probably the most beautiful and haunting melody he's ever written, and only Don't Let it Bring You Down off Goldrush in even its class. Played with a slide dobro accompanied by only a banjo it grabs the listener from the opening. This song and Walk On are on Decade, and a large number of people have already purchased that wonderful compilation, so I'll let the people listen to For the Turnstiles and Walk On to let them hear if they think those songs are the product of a disturbed and confused mind, or one that is razor sharp and well focused? <BR>Vampire Blues is a bluesy romp ala Down by the River, but he's really taking a bite out of everybody who is so rosy in their own outlook of life, yet have been savagely attacking him during this difficult period caused by the loss of his good friend Danny Whitten and road manager Bruce Berry to tragic drug overdoses in a very short span of time, in which he really did go on a alcohol induced dark dirge on his Tonight's the Night LP after freakin' out audiences with his macabre, nihilistic Time Fades Away tour. <BR>Side two opens with the sprawling and weary title track, this is the weakest cut on the album, and it is merely very good and not either outstanding or epic like all the other cuts on the album. <BR>...the world is turning I hope it don't turn away, I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day. This song is just an honest and stark statement about what he's been dealing with and how he has managed to cope with all of the garbage, virtually all alone, without any real help from anyone...Get <BR>out of town, think I'll get out of town. No, not checking out, just getting out of LA and the shallow music scene. <BR>Motion Pictures is a low key acoustic ballad describing a day in the life of NY's blue period. ...all those people think they got it made, but I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow, or trade, anything <BR>that I have to be one of them, I'd rather start all over again. No this isn't about death, it's about rebirth. <BR>Ambulance Blues is the masterpiece of this collage of pain, sorrow, anger, vitriolic satire, and self loathing, which he had been dealing with, and now a new and triumphantly re-energized Neil Young has emerged with a strong and positive outlook on life. He attacks his critics and every other person who worked him over, and couldn't wait to attack his flanks when he was down. No mercy, no pity and no prisoners. ...so all you critics sit alone,you're no better than me for what you've shown, with your stomach pump and hook and ladder dreams, we could get together for some scenes...this is Neil at his acerbic best. The classic line in this song is...you're all just pissin' in the wind, you don't know it but you are, and there ain't nothing like a friend, who can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind...This is what his good friend and long time manger Elliot Roberts told Neil when he was in his grief induced funk which got him to straighten up his act. Now Neil is saying the same thing to his critics, come on straighten up I'm telling you what a friend told me to escape the bitterness....I guess I'll call this sickness gone...That pretty well sums it all up.                                                              This isn't an album for or about the weak or pitiful, and it is brutally honest at times, but the humor, sardonicism, and wonderful way he weaves this tapestry together is about surviving and hope, not about death and despair. A number of people didn't get it at the time, namely sycophantic record producers and A&R \\"yes\\" men, and this is without a doubt the most important work by one of the biggest talents in the history of the genre of popular music. Thankfully, for whatever reason, this magnificent recording which was being held hostage, has now been released on CD, so people can finally hear how valuable it truly is. When you get your hands on a legitimate copy of this <BR>magnificent and monumental achievement. I suggest you go back and listen really closely to it again, and if you still don't hear something you missed when you panned this tour de force, then perhaps you should be a spineless, tin-eared, record executive? Hopefully, you'll hear what some of us have heard for years, and many more people who would have loved to, if they only could have; well, FINALLY, MORE PEOPLE CAN!                                                            By the way, I saw Neil perform near the beginning of his 1998 solo, acoustic tour. I'd seen a list of the songs that he'd played at the previous intimate venues, and one of them was See the Sky About to Rain, however, I thought if he was going to FINALLY play something from On The Beach, then it should be AMBULANCE BLUES! People were shouting out what song of Neil's they wanted to hear, but from about 10 rows back I said in a clear and even tone, \\"AMBULANCE BLUES\\" a couple of times, and I could've sworn that he was looking for the person who said it? After I said, \\"AMBULANCE BLUES\\" between songs for the third time, Neil then said he was going to take a brief intermission. When he came back he played one tune, then he played AMBULANCE BLUES, and even though he hadn't played it for a VERY LONG TIME, he still was able to play the entire song virtually just as it is on this recording. After he was done he looked at me and said, \\"That's for you, Jack!\\" I replied, \\"gee, thanks Uncle Neil,\\" and then we both chuckled. Actually, I think Neil needed to play it, even MORE than I wanted to hear it? After all, he'd kept that cathartic masterpiece ALL TO himself for FAR TOO LONG, and repression is just not a healthy thing. Yo Jack, I mean Neil, isn't that why you made this incredible recording in the first place? Genius can be so stupid sometimes! I rarely use the term Genius, but I'd say that Lennon, Dylan, and Neil Young probably are deserving of the term, and this is a remarkable portrait of a tortured genius, who is able to work out the pain by using his unique and unquestionable talent. HOW OFTEN CAN OTHERS GET A GLIMPSE OF THAT? It's WORTH looking into, again and again! (Originally submitted on 8/29/03, but like On The Beach, hopefully this review will FINALLY be available to the public.)
B00006JDVV|1.0|First of all, don't listen to those calling this a &quot;b-movie&quot;. This is, at best, a z-movie, or an xy-movie. It's also, easily, an AH-movie with &quot;AH&quot; standing for &quot;Absolutely Horrible&quot;.<br />     How movies like this are awarded a budget to begin with must be one of the great mysteries of the film industry.<BR>    &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; has a lot of nothing:<BR>-it's supposed to have flying mean dragons but instead it has flying shadows and effects reminiscent of bad 80s films.<BR>-it's supposed to have a plot but that is only claimed on the back cover of the DVD. In the movie itself the plot is well hidden.<BR>-it's supposed to be &quot;suspensful&quot; and &quot;action packed&quot; but as you might be guessing from the core of the reviews here in Amazon many a folk must've slept happily through it.<BR>-basically, the best scene of the whole film is the one shown on the front cover of the DVD. Sadly, in the movie itself there's nothing that comes even suspiciously close to that.<br />It also has such monstrous plot-holes that all of the dragons &quot;shown&quot; in it could easily pass through them. We are not talking here your average lil' plot mistakes. No, we are talking major league plot holes.<BR>   Just one example:<BR>the dragons (which you hardly see) are supposed to have taken over the planet because they are basically invincible. But yet, the survivors are able to take out dragons with either primitive weapons or with low caliber machine guns. Uhm, ok, but then why couldn't the world's air forces have dealt with the dragons with their state of the art weaponry? <br />     Oh there's more, much more silliness like the one described above, but, what's the point of going through it all...<BR>    This is just one seriously bad film, one more that butchers an idea with great potential (man, there must be millions of'm that do that out there) and simoultaneously a movie that poses dangers to your pocket as well as your brain.<BR>Unless, well, unless you've already suffered lobotomy...
B000069AUI|5.0|The best album of the year 2002 from probably the most successful band of 2003, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; won multiple awards, including various VMAs and two 2003 Grammy Awards, and that rightfully. Coldplay astonished the music world in 2000 with their harmonious debut \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is a more than worthy follow-up. Their style can be characterized as melodious, dreamy and just outright beautiful - something I have been looking for in music all my life. Now I know what I have been missing. The simplicity and clarity of their melodies provides their music both with magic and an accessibility that is never in danger to border on boredom - which is probably the reason for their mainstream success, that I guess is somewhat due to Chris's charming good looks as my future wife continues to point out. In all, this is a delightful album that is filled with emotional and spherical melodies which make Coldplay's music so perfect for the better moments in life. Highlights for me are \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"A Warning Sign\\" and surely \\"Clocks\\".
B00008OLIC|5.0|Let me state that I am a huge fan of this band, and this album I credit with getting me hooked on the Crue.In a time where everybody I knew was getting hooked on the grunge movement or still listening to New Kids on The Block, I was listening to this album and proudly sporting my Motley Crue shirt. This album is a nonstop heavy rock n' roll record. The title track which was based on Scarface is awesome, as well as &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;, &quot;S.O.S.&quot;, &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot;, and &quot;Don't Go Away Mad&quot; are the hard rockin tracks as well as the ballads &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Time For Change&quot;. You have  four great elements in the Crue, Vince Neil's voice is at its best, and he is still better than Axl no matter WHAT ANYONE SAYS! Mick Mars and that great guitar work, Nikki Sixx pounding the bass, and of the course Banging the skins is Mr Tommy Lee, a great drummer who isn't given enough credit for his work. The Crue is awesome and this album is proof that the crue can rock anybody's world, it certainley did mine!

0385504209|4.0|I loved the premise of the book. Secret soieties, clues hidden in world famous paintings, and some of the best-kept secrets of the world. This book is absolutely phenomenal and I would recommend it to all my friends. It is no wonder that it has stayed on the bestseller list.<br />The only thing that I can find at fault with this book is the ending. It leaves the reader with the sense of, &quot;Wait, what just happened?&quot;<br />Other than that, I think this book is one of the best books of its time.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I sat down to watch this Anime, shortly after I watched Princess Momonoke for the 47th time, and was beginning to think, could anything ever hope to top the beauty and splendor of Mononoke? From the moment the DVD booted up, I knew the answer.<br />Yes something could be better than Mononokem and that something is Spirited away.<br />The story is gripping, with enough humor to keep you chuckling, and enough drama to keep you wanting more. The animation is beautifully done, giving you the impression of a fantastical world, that somehow manages to have roots in reality.<br />The character of Chihiro is loveable, and one that you can develop a real sense of empathy for. She has real emotions, and expresses them freely.<br />Watch this DVD, And prepare to be amazed.
0385504209|5.0|I thought DaVinci Code was one of the best books I have ever read.  Having been raised Catholic and always having questioned womens role in the church I thought this book brought an excellent perspective to the doubts I have had since I can remember.
055357342X|5.0|This series is phenomenal. There are so many mediocre books in this genre, with cardboard characters and senseless plots. This book carries on a story which fascinates, as the characters flow through a variety of problems and challenges. I am looking forward to the next book, which will lead to new feints and goals.
B000067CPX|4.0|The chili peppers are undoubtedly my favourite band, and they should be everyone elses! They are easily the worlds best band as everyone likes atleast some of there music. I don't believe this is there best album, my favourite is definitely \\"californication\\".<BR>   However John's guitar skills are shown to there full extent in by the way. He plays amazing solo's all the way through the album. The best song is definitely \\"can't stop\\", beginning with a huge build up using johns amazing lead guitar riffs combined with chads amazing rhythm. Then it gets better when john including his singing with johns haunting backing vocals.All the way through Flea plays his base laying down great backing support.<BR>   This album is definitely amazing, with flea amazing  you in \\"don't forget me\\". Chad showing his umbelievable skillas a funk drummer. Frusciante  proving his genius on the guitar his best work definitely in cabron. These three lay down an amazing tune for anthony to sing on top of. He finishes each and every song off amazingly. Aswell as all of this flea also adds a lot of brass in to some of the songs adding a hole new level of brilliance to the album. The best is definetly yet to come from the chili's later this year i think they are releasing a new album after a well deserved 6 month break!<BR>p.s. If you buy this album also buy \\"californication\\" and \\"blood sugar sex magic\\" as they are both just as good as this, if not better.
0515127485|4.0|It's clear that former BBC correspondent Harris either knows or has researched a great deal about Russia: from the life and deeds, many horrible enough to compare to Hitler, of Joseph Stalin, to the modern day \\"replacement nation\\" that forms the former Soviet Union.  When Fluke Kelso, a Brit historian specializing in Stalin travels to Moscow to attend a minor conference, he gets a tip that encourages him to hunt for the oft rumored lost notebooks in which Stalin supposedly detailed his everyday endeavors.  Soon a suspenseful race against the modern day secret police, hardly above brutality themselves given the prize at stake, leads Kelso on a wild chase to find either the notebooks, or could it be, Stalin's lover or her offspring.  The tipster's daughter eventually gets involved, much against her wishes, and contributes a great deal to the dazzlingly ironic ending to an incredibly chilling and thrilling story line.<br />Harris demonstrates not merely a command of his subject matter but a knack for writing action scenes that keeps the pages turning quickly.  On half a dozen occasions, we found our leading characters twisting into new scenarios just when we felt that neither they nor we could stand any more tension and suspense.  Once you get by the strange place and person names, and can keep the roster of characters straight, Archangel becomes a highly entertaining, satisfying story sure to please almost any reader, let alone those with a bent for historical fiction.  Enjoy!
B00005JM9C|5.0|This movie was outstanding! For any one who likes dance, this movie is for you. Just watching Honey and the others dance makes you just want to get up and do your own moves!!!! Honey is an amazing dancer and the story has a wonderful message about making it \\"on your own Terms.\\"
0345452577|3.0|Feeling that the Alex Delaware series has lost a great deal of zest in recent books, we snapped up this latest Kellerman on learning it featured a completely new leading man, psychologist Jeremy Carrier.  This doc practices on staff at a regular hospital; and we were surprised to learn how busy he was with the care and concerns of fairly normal patients whose current medical conditions were mostly other than mental difficulties.  Carrier himself is dealing with the unsolved murder of his former serious nurse girlfriend, a case that has brought suspicion against himself by cop Bob Duresh.  Soon a couple more killings suggest a possible link between Carrier's girlfriend and the other victims, a thought that once again sics Duresh onto his trail.  Then another mysterious character, pathologist Arthur Chess, befriends Jeremy and invites him to an elaborate dinner meeting of some sort of secret society interested in dark human deeds.  A series of follow-up clues from Chess to Carrier set our hero in pursuit of who might be the real perpetrator of these crimes.  The clues continue to unfold and confound as Kellerman sets a nice pace of action and reaction throughout this suspenseful mystery; and of course our hero catches the bad guy in the end.<br />We felt mixed emotions about this novel.  We almost always enjoy Kellerman's writing, even though his last few books seemed a little stale.  Our problem with this one is that while the mystery per se was entertaining enough, the characters were almost lookalikes to the Delaware clan:  Jeremy for Alex, new girlfriend Angela for Robin, and cop Duresh for Sturgis, though the latter mostly an adversary instead of an ally.  We find the speculation of other reviewers that maybe this manuscript was a precursor to the Delaware series as mildly amusing, but not impossible.  So -- reasonably good novel, but not great.
1558216847|3.0|This story is unbelievable but entertaining.  One's incredulity was stretched by their journey and subsequently exceeded with the sighting of the abdomitable snowmen  at the end. The fact that the survivors never stayed in touch also detracts. A swim across the Indian Ocean was the only unbelievable element left out. He would have been a great salesman.
B00000AFGM|5.0|To my mind, this is Manson's best work. It's post-antichrist, which was a messy, angry, sludgy affair. It was too much like every other industrial metal band, it didn't sound any different to anything else sitting on the shelves marked 'industrial'. <BR>Animals is a more refined sound... more melodic, more experimental (but not in a bad way), more easy-listening Manson than angry-shouty-Trent Reznor brainchild Manson.<br />Intelligent lyrics you won't be embarassed to sing aloud, melodic hooks that sound fresh and interesting even five years on. It has clean, crisp production and sitting in a category of its own, at times Animals approaches a parallel with Beck, the genre-defiling pop chameleon. The songs on Animals are different from anything Manson (or anyone else, for that matter) has ever produced or will every produce again. And that's a real shame, because after this, he went downhill. Holywood was flat and lacked passion. Golden Age, his latest effort, is abysmal. <br />Completely different from anything else on the shelves, Animals is experimental, melodic, insightful, not-quite-metal industrial disco-rock. Aladdin Sane-era David Bowie meets Pink Floyd meets Beck meets Trent Reznor. It's a shame Manson doesn't do it like this anymore.
6305648522|5.0|This is the most enchanting movie I 've crossed paths with. The plot is beautifull and the end will leave you breathless. Once we grow up we tend to forget from where we came and that we were kids once.  Certainly a movie you will never, ever, forget...

0783226837|5.0|Tremors is just-for-fun, but extremely well done. The cast, writing and effects are top-notch. This is a film I rewatch every now and then, so it's worth having on DVD. Before buying, though, check out Tremors 4, which is about the same price and includes a free copy of Tremors as of January 2004.
0425163407|1.0|It's funny: at med school a continuing joke is that the worst med students, at the bottom of the class, wind up as pathologists, because at least then they can't kill anyone. Here we're presented with a humorless, unlikable protagonist who is constantly flattered and told how brilliant she is -- I had heard these were bad, but I tried two and these really are the worst crime novels I've ever read. I know my dissenting vote won't affect the true fans, but this is subliterary dreck.
B000002L7Y|5.0|The first time I heard a-ha was when I saw the then-groundbreaking music video for &quot;Take On Me&quot; on MTV (when they were playing music videos).  This was months before &quot;Take On Me&quot; went to #1 in the USA and when the band was just starting out.  After &quot;Take On Me&quot; (fast-paced and melodic in nature) came &quot;The Sun Always Shines On TV&quot; (which was a bit heavy on the guitars and abrasive, but still catchy and melodic).  I decided to get the album just on those two singles alone.  Every song on the album is a winner.  &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; and the title track stand out especially.  Since their debut album, the trio have gone from synthpop to a kind of music that I would consider to be far more adult contemporary, which isn't bad to say the least.  The follow-up, &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot;, has a couple good songs, but that's about it.  The follow-up to THAT album, &quot;Stay On These Roads&quot;, also has a couple good songs, but that's about it too.  In my humble opinion, none of their follow-up albums are as good as their debut.  I guess that's what happens when bands start to change their style.  Anyway, if you like &quot;Take On Me&quot;, you won't be disappointed with the rest of the songs!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|After 130+ reviews there is not much new to add about how wonderful this set is. I do want to stress how expertly well this was filmed, audio recorded, edited and mixed. A big first for a Beatles related concert film/DVD. Anybody releasing a concert DVD from this point on should be required to view this and learn. <br />For one thing, if you feel so compelled to make a documentary movie about a concert or tour, include the complete concert on a second disc. As nice as the documentary film part of this set is, if that had been all we got, a lot of the best moments and performances would have been missing. On the flip side, seeing the documentary too added great insights to watching the show uninterupted. Seeing the whole show in the correct running order builds a better climax.<br />Second, you can watch this without noticing (or being distracted and annoyed by) the camera editing. This doesn't use 2-3 second edits where you can't focus an anything. You actually get time to soak in the emotion coming from the performers. It makes the show much more real, and enjoyable. The only thing I miss, it would have been nice at the end to show a photo with each musician credit so you know who is who in a band that big. I've heard all those names for years, but still don't know who I'm seeing on stage.<br />This is a first-class product, for a first-class guy that still only scratches the surface of all his first-class music. Buy it, treasure it, keep spreading the word that this is how great a concert DVD can be if the right people are in charge.
0688002307|1.0|I read this book while riding a train from New Mexico to New Jersey, this seemed an appropriate venue given the subject matter.  I had meant to read the book for quite some time, I had heard rave reviews from friends, and I believe that the book had even appeared on one summer reading list I had received in high-school.<BR>  I was shocked by how bad the book was.  First, as a book, it is gramatically a mess.  Normally, this would probably be of little import for a &quot;book of ideas&quot;, but Robert M. Pirsig was apparently a professor in a university English Department, consequently, he ought to know better.<BR>  However, and more importantly, the substantive content of the novel struck me as not only poorly reasoned, but somehow ominous.  Mr. Pirsig initially gets stuck (for lack of a better term) on the fact that he cannot define &quot;quality.&quot;  He refuses to accept that the term quality is refers to an essentialy subjective measurement.  Consequently, he searches for an objective definition of quality.  Failing he decides to reject the &quot;dichotomy&quot; which would divide the universe into objective and subjective views, and refuses to give the word any definition.  He then decides that quality is the meeting of the objective and the subjective, the moment at which out subjective desired meet the objective universe and cause all creation.  The Tao, except formed from human desire.<BR>  First, &quot;quality&quot; does in fact refer to a subjective characteristic.  Something is considered of high quality if it does what the observers want it to do.  Second, I do not think that Mr. Pirsig is justified as characterising modern views on the objective and the subjective as a dichotomy.  That would imply two equally valid views of the universe.  There is in fact only one, the objective, the term subjective refers to the fact that we can see only a small portion of the objective universe, and only from one angle at a time.  The subjective view of reality isnot a viewpoint that competes with the objective, it is that incomplete portion of the objective universe to which any person had access.<BR>  Finally, Mr. Pirsig's definition of quality struck me as ludicrous.  I do not believe that there can be a meeting place between human desires and the objective universe, our desires, like we ourselves, are part of the universe, viewed objectively.  Further, it seems the height of arrogance to argue that the motive force behind all creation is our subjective desires.  Were that true nothing would have been created prior to human beings, and nothing is being created outside the sphere of our influence.  Neither is true.<BR>  Finally, I found Mr. Pirsig's style extremely grating.  In every instance in which a person dared disagree with him, Mr. Pirsig immediately attributed the fracture either to some secret motive, or to the fact that his opponent lacks the intelectual independence to see the truth.  The thought never occurs that his detractors may have a point.  Ultimately, I do not think Robert Pirsig was interested in any sort ot dialectic, or any forward moving debate, to do so would require he grant creedence to opposing viewpoints.  Mr. Pirsig seeks followers.  <BR>  All in all, I think the book was pedantic, poorly written and poorly thought.  Mr. Pirsig's own ego provides to great a road block to allow him to make any serious inquiries into values, or into anything else.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Unbelieveable.  Amazing.  Powerful.  Since the day I opened this CD from it's little plastic coccoon, it has been melted to the stereo.  This album is the best of my collection and one that I reccommend to the average rocker.  When your chin is high, the sounds and rhythems are unmatched.  When your chin is down, the lyrics will put you in your place.  Every track gives a new angle to life and greati lyrics in your head on rainy days.  Again, I cannot say enough about this album.

B00005JM4Z|4.0|In 2001 \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" was testimony to the unexpected lure of a howling engine, blue smoke from spinning tires, and hot dudes and babes in even hotter cars. Oh yeah, and the moody glower of breakout star Vin Diesel. <BR>So what do you do for the sequel? More smoke, babes, dudes and howling. And no Diesel. <br />The result? Well, as expected, director John Singleton (\\"Boyz N the Hood\\") did not make a movie as good as \\"FF1.\\" This is way better. <br />How is it better? Let us count the ways. First, he got rid of all the extraneous stuff -- like plot. \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" has something to do with money and drugs, but Singleton wisely doesn't spend too much time sweating the details. Basically, it boils down to one of two situations: The guys have something and must drive 120 mph to escape with it, or they are after something and must drive 120 mph to capture it. <br />Second, the lumpish presence of Diesel and his biceps is barely missed at all. Like the first version, this film seems to be set up as a star vehicle for blue-eyed, Steve McQueenesque Paul Walker. But once again it looks as if the sidekick walks off with the movie. <br />An actor, rapper and model, Tyrese (as Walker's pal Roman Pearce) brings something new to Diesel's role as the moody, hard-driving loner -- a personality. He's not just buffed and cocky, he's got such a nice way with a one-liner that he grows on you. <br />Like virtually everyone else in the sequel, Tyrese was not part of the original. This is exactly the same movie as the first one except for the fact that almost all the actors have changed, it is now set in Miami instead of Southern California, and a Cuban drug dealer (Cole Hauser of \\"White Oleander\\") has been added as a villain. <br />The constant is that these are still the sort of hot-wheelers who -- when a 20-foot jump is unexpectedly inserted at the end of a white-knuckle race -- find it to be an exhilarating and amusing development. They sail hundreds of feet through theair hollering \\"Whoooooooo!\\" at the top of their lungs, and have a good laugh about it at the finish line. (No one gets hurt, of course, despite the lack of helmets, seat belts or parachutes.) <br />The new premise is that Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, has been kicked off the police force and is scratching out a borderline existence in Florida as a street racer. His buddy, Tej (rapper Ludacris, an improvement over Ja- Rule in \\"FF1\\"), runs the garage, finds him races and helps him live the car culture life. Call it \\"Boyz Under the Hood.\\" <br />O'Conner needs money and is offered a chance to make some -- and, of course, <br />clear his name -- on an undercover job with U.S. Customs. In an amazing coincidence, the undercover agent he is working with happens to be a gorgeous brunette (Eva Mendes of \\"Training Day\\"). He also picks up his pal Roman (Tyrese) to help run the scam. And we're off. <br />RIVETING DRAG RACES<BR>One nice touch is that in Miami they are apparently not into that boring, side-by-side drag racing from \\"FF1.\\" This is real street racing with NASCAR- style fender-rubbing and bumper-bumping. There are at least three set pieces in which cars careen through traffic, cutting off semitrailers, skidding across lanes and creating spectacular crashes. It is riveting -- except for those who have driven there, who will recognize it as just another typical day on a Miami freeway. <br />However, it should be said that Singleton does a nice job of keeping the gratuitous violence to a minimum. Nothing says summer film fun like explosions, <br />guns and cartwheeling cars -- and that's all here -- but the gore and mayhem is restrained. The scene you'll be talking about afterward, involving a rat, a bucket and a blowtorch, is especially clever since its effect depends almost entirely on the viewer's imagination, not grisly details. <br />The rest of the action is more likely to spark interest in high-performance racing gear than gunplay. <br />HIGH-SPEED FANTASY<BR>There will probably be a rash of concerned citizens who decry the crazy driving showcased in the film. But the FF movies may be saving the clutch-and- shift car from extinction. (Although someone should point out that there is not a street racer in the world that has a gear that can be engaged at 114 mph to make the car go faster.) <br />At the end, the whole thing makes no more sense than the conclusion, an implausible, pointless, high-speed leap over hundreds of feet of water. But that doesn't mean you won't be hollering \\"Whoooooooo!\\" all the way.
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is a clever piece of clockwork, but with a little more thought and ingenuity it could have been even more clever. The riddles are the best part of it, but the characters take far too long to figure them out. And sometimes the answers are of the &quot;D'oh!&quot; kind that would make any reader with average intelligence slap his or her forehead and moan, &quot;I should have guessed!&quot; It's rather like working a Washington Post crossword puzzle, where the clues are hidden by ambiguity and misdirection rather than true obscurity.<br />About midway through the novel, I started to see at least some of the plot twists coming several pages away. (I spotted one twist very early on, and then had to wait until almost the end of the book to have it confirmed.)<br />&quot;Historical accuracy&quot; in a pop thriller isn't really to be expected, but there was a lot of, at best, sloppy and careless thinking in the supposed historical background. For just one example: the most fanatical and murderous obsession with &quot;witches&quot; and the most determined attacks on the feminine principle in religion came from the Protestant lands, including England - the Inquisition had very little to do with that. (Brown should have read Robert Graves and Joseph Campbell as well as his sensationalist pro-Templar sources.)<br />There is also a further level of enigma that could have been laid on the mystery. Casual reading suggests that the dying man failed to name his killer because he did not know who was responsible. Yet a further reading of the clues he left suggests that he DID point an accusing finger...but we are never told how he could have figured it out, because by then the story was being rushed to its conclusion and details were being brushed aside.
B000002H33|2.0|The lack of original guitarist Dave Mustaines blazing riffs is appearent on this album. However it has it's moments and is enjoyable the first 10 listens or so.
0790732254|4.0|'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' is that rare thing; a movie adaptation of a stage play where we know, ever without having to be told, that it originated on the stage. It is a completely character-driven piece, full of intense dialogue, isolation &amp; repression, and a sense of desolation and sadness that not even the most accomplished contemporary movies can match.<br />George and Martha (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are having newly-employed University colleague Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) back for late-night drinks, after a faculty party. While there, the hapless young couple stumble upon the web of lies and psychological abuse that passes for a marriage between George and Martha, and through a process of drinking, seduction and cruelty, leave with their own young marriage in tatters.<br />It is simply not possible to make tangible exactly how absorbing Taylor and Burton are in this picture. Certainly Burton's finest hour, he plays the part of the henpecked, abused George with brilliant depth and pathos, and ranges from abusee to abuser with such believable energy and commitment that we dare not look away. The same can be said of Taylor; this film is her absolute finest hour, and in the character of the ugly, foulmouthed Martha she takes the viewer by the throat and keeps us close to her for the whole film. Hers is a character on a par with Bette Davis in Baby Jane, a monstrous bundle of complex neuroses that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, but far more human and believable than Jane, Martha creates fear because she could so easily be real.<br />Sanders and Dennis are also excellent as the unlucky young couple forced to re-evaluate their own marriage. Although Dennis won an Oscar for her portrayal as Honey, Sanders gives a hugely noteworhty performance as Nick, the ayrean hero subverted by the sickness of George and Martha's situation. <br />In such a piece, direction is never required to be more than competent, and while the typcial Hollywood decision to have three different locations for the movie will cause some chagrin to fans of the stage play, the rest of the direction is done in the true noir-style. Camerawork is unobtrusive and lighting is used sparingly, to create an atmosphere as emotionally detached as it is devastating.<br />'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' is not a happy movie. It is the antithesis of the feel-good flick, to the point where you may feel some initial dislike for it. However it affects you, and it will, you cannot help but feel awestruck by the magnificence of the performances or the amount of emotion generated by the leads. A true example of the power of fine acting, 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is an absolute must-have addition to anyone's collection.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the crown jewel of metal albums. Rust in peace is the metal album that all other albums tries to be but aren't. It is impossible to explain in words the greatness of this album. It has to be listened to, to be understood. This is what becomes when four guys use their instruments to it's full potential. Give it a listen and be blown away!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is by far the best Broadway musical of the season and the CD is wickedly addictive! I can't stop humming the melodies and the leading voices (Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth) are incredible. Songs like &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;Loathing&quot;, and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; can easily become Broadway classics. I cannot understand the critics who gave lukewarm reviews to the show or the music. Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed! Wicked is definitely MAGIC!!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|In two words: moronic &amp; pretentious. If I had to waste more words I'd say there was never a story here. The amount of time spent viewing this was excruciating - I stayed because of a friend. The plot isn't worth mentioning. The actors do nothing. My favorite scene was when some vampire jumps on top of a car and sticks a knife inbetween the driver and passenger side seats, like he thought someone might be there. This isn't Horror, this isn't smart, this isn't gothic, this doesn't deserve a sequel. I hated when 'Viktor' is revealed to be the badguy behind Selene's parents death, like it's a big revelation and we're all supposed to feel betrayed by this character or like anyone gave a damn.
B0000CEB4V|3.0|I had been seeing the ads on TV for this DVD and it looked like it would be a really fun and exciting concert to watch.  I was quite disappointed when I began watching the DVD and the first half of it was Indian music.  The second half was better, and actually had some great moments.  However, overall the great moments were too few.<br />I also purchased the Bee Gees - Just One Night concert which I would highly recommend.  It is an excellent show.  Also, I purchased Simon &amp; Garfunkle - Concert in Central Park and found that to be very enjoyable.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I had put off buying this CD because if it sounded just like Mer De Noms I felt I didn't need it, and if the subject matter was like Tool, I would've been disappointed. Then I saw it on sale and decided that from what I heard of a friend's copy I should get it. The instrumentation and vocals work together wonderfully, I'm pleased I bought it and it's easily among the top albums of the year for 2003.
B00006CXSS|5.0|the first i watched this, i figured that it was just another WWII movie. but, this was so much better!!! this is a must buy, i cannot understand why anyone who likes learning or watching movies about WWII does not have this!! this set is worth the cost. you will want to watch it over and over
B00009TB5G|5.0|(let me warn you ahead of time I am a terrible speller x_0 I hope you can even get something out of this)<br />.. I cant really truly rate a film like this, for I apsolutely love the books.. and of course I love the movies as well.. but I've read the books first and I am only used to that story line and I got a lot more out of the books than the movies.. in the movies I can just assume that the parts that werent shown exsist (I know I know its a fiction story but you know what I mean xP) and I would have loved it a whole lot better if they would have included some of my favorite parts.. but ah well:/..well anyways the downside is the parts that they add to make a whole knew story.. that I do not like.. J.R.R. Tolkien KNEW what he was doing when he had a certain person say a certain thing to another certain person. Or that he had something happen or not happen to a certain person. And I know I know.. the can't fit EVERYTHING from the story to the book.. but if they can FIT REPLACING something for a totaly different concept now you'd think they can fit the origanal couldn't you?<br />I am tired of people judging the Lord of the Rings if they have not read the books, DO NOT JUST judge this story from the movies and DO NOT judge the books by just reading 10 or 50 or even 100 pgs and saying oop! I'm done too boring! It took me about 100 pages to get into the book and understand what was going on..(I have since then re-read those 100 pgs +) at first yes sadly I'll admit I thought it was boring only because I hadn't the slightest clue what was going on.. but after I got in to it I loved it! and so here I am today sitting at the computer typing a review and completely frustrated at some of the reviews I've read dissing LotR big time.. okay I was going to write a bunch of stuff but why bother x_0<br />Alright enough of that.. the movie is really truely and obviously a very hard piece of work. I have a lot of respect for the producers, directers, cast, crew, stunt people, sound directers, composers, artists, and everyone! awww! I feel SO bad for all of them after watching the two extra cds! oh my what Andy Serkis had to go through.. all the actors had to go through.. all the artists and sound and computer people and directers with their duedates!! and everyone! but OH MY! I LOVED seeing the extra CDS!! SO SO interesting! and the commentaries! I love seeing the behind the scene stuff! I love to learn on what and how they did it! It's just so interesting! But that's just me.. well anyways.. that's about it.. DEFENITLY my favorite movie (not saying the TTT is my fav, saying LotR is my fav because in my opinion there all one) I loved the music too! I'm probably boring you by now.. or even bored you from the beggining:P but anyways that's it for me;D
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I just got this soundtrack for my birthday from my cousin and I seriously love it. I listen to it while I am driving and when certain songs come on I can just see the movie in my head because of the music I love it. My friend and I were driving around and giggling like we were 5 year olds over this soundtrack. We're like, &quot;Oh remember this part in the movie&quot; and then start quoting lines and yeah. This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever owned (just music no singing). I love it. I can't wait to get Peter Pan and the new Lord of the Rings!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|The seventies are over and Jet sucks.  Get over it.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I have been a fan of the offspring for a long time and i think by far this is the best album. Splinter (their new album) was  just ok but this kicks.
B00000AFHM|4.0|The Boy with the Arab Strap was my first foray into Belle &amp; Sebastian.  A combination of retro 60's sounding melodies, chord progressions, and sunshine and bubble-gum lyrics with a dash of angst brings together a modern day version of Peter, Paul, and Mary.  The first play in my CD player, I wondered what I had wasted my money on.  The second play, I started picking out a few songs I really liked, and by listening to them a few more times the album grew on me.<br />Like Rush's Geddy Lee, Stuart Murdoch's vocals take a few listens to get used to, and like Lee and Rush, many people will never give B&amp;S a chance in spite of Murdoch's voice.  It's a shame, since they're missing out on a great band that doesn't get enough credit.<br />The Boy with the Arab Strap is good, but not perfect.  There are a few songs that are very forgettable and lyrically convoluted.  Seymour Stein has a catchy hook, but feels like every other pop ballad released in the 60's and 70's.  In A Space Boy Dream, Murdoch literally speaks a story, with a fast-paced postlude of jazzy music at the end that really has no listener value to non die-hard fans.<br />That being said, there are indeed some incredible tunes on this CD.  It Could Have Been a Brilliant Career, A Summer Wasting, and Simple Things stand out quite well.  But the highlight of the album is Dirty Dream Number Two.  Think of The Doors Touch Me combined with Tom Jones' It's Not Unusual and you have Dirty Dream Number Two.  It's an example of Belle &amp; Sebastian at their finest.<br />The Boy with the Arab Strap has found a place on the small pile of CD's atop my CD player, ready to be inserted at any time.  When I need a quick pick-me-up or a stress-reliever, it's the first album I play, though never from cover to cover.
B0000640VO|5.0|I hate subtitles. I just don't like not having to try to read the dialogue while I'm trying to watch the visuals. I guess I am not that coordinated. However..... I absolutley loved Amelie. This movie is visually breathtaking and wonderfully original. It celebrates the little quirks in life and in people. That's how the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film is opened, with a quick rundown of all the things these characters love and hate and how those things define who they are. <br />To warn you all, this film is not for everyone. It is not the standard hollywood type of story. But if you are ready for something different and something uplifting this movie would be for you. I myself was caught off guard and loved it.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I'm no jazz expert, in fact, it's not my preferred genre of choice, but I'm more into the old standards I suppose. I tried this cd from just being bombarded with &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and even though there are one or two charmers on the cd, this turned out to be a major disappointment.<BR>I'm not saying that Ms. Jones isn't talented, her voice is lovely, but I expected a little more from all of the glowing reviews and praises that I had heard from everyone and their mother.  It doesn't bug me that much that she didn't write many of her songs, hell, &quot;Turn Me On&quot; and &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; are the only two songs that I really like.<BR>Still, this one was a major disappointment for me.  I regret not purchasing some Billie Holiday instead.
B00005BJQY|5.0|And we did, right down the rabbit hole into the world of the Wachowski brothers fabulous scifi thriller The Matrix. This visually stunning film introduces us to the  world of the future where machines rule, and most of humankind has been reduced to a power source.But there are rebels. Morpheus {Laurence Fishburne},and the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar are searching the matrix looking for the &quot;One&quot;. The prophecized saviour of  humanity.Is Neo {Keanu Reeves}, the crews latest extraction from the matrix,the One? Does he believe he can be?                With a heart pounding pace this film takes you on a special effects ride through this machine world, with new technologies like Bullet Time and CGI's,  along with Hong Kong style wire fight scenes it held me gluded to my seat until the end.           I throughly enjoyed the ride and anxiously await the sequel.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie was great! Most musical musics suck, but this had action and music and it kept you &quot;wanting more&quot;, if you saw this and thought it sucked.. rent it and give it a second chance.. i know the first time i saw it i thought it was awful but when i saw it again i thought it was fabulous... so go out to blockbuster and just rent it and see how you like it.
0375701427|5.0|With American Pastoral, Philip Roth came pretty damn close to writing America after WW2. While I was reading Underworld, I thought Delillo had pulled it off, but now I know better. I'll admit, at the start I wasn't hooked in, but by about page 11 I became aware that I was reading greatness. You know that tingly feeling you get when you realise that the book you are about to read is special? That's what I had.<br />The story is fairly straight forward, but it is told in an interesting way. It seems that the narrator (Zuckerman) had an infatuation with the school sports hero who had everything: girls, success, looks, all that jazz. Later on in life when Zuckerman is a successful author he meets up with The Swede, who wrote him a letter asking to help write a biography of his father. Zuckerman is intrigued by this, mostly because of the power his high school years had over him, so he accepts. But the Swede doesn't tell him anything, then, at a reunion a few months later, he learns that the Swede died of cancer.<br />So, Zuckerman decided to recreate the Swede's life, find out where it went wrong and what happened. He has a few clues from the Swede's brother and from his own memories, but most of it is imagined. It is a good way for Zuckerman to meander on about how life affects you and how you affect it, what happens to people behind closed doors that we just don't know about and, touchingly, how a father can love his daughter so much when she disappoints him at every turn - and tragically at that.<br />The ending wasn't particularly punchy, but it finished well with a nice tie-up of the few threads that needed to be tied up at all. Like life, not everything ends on the point of a period, and American Pastoral reflects this. I feel that a younger man couldn't have written this book, that it really did need the weight of years and experience to create, and I feel better for having read it. <br />Highly recommended.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is the second best movie in the trilogy. The performances are very strong and more realistic than the first. The spotlight of this film came from Elijah Wood, who brought the main charachter, Frodo Baggins, to life. He was at his best whenever the ring would call to him and he'd fall into the trance. Sean Astin was a strong supporter, but he became great in Return of the King. Ian McKellen was something else. As Gandalf, the white wizard, he performed brilliantly. Viggo Mortinsen was also great, and showed human emotions brilliantly. Especially when he was at Helm's Deep. The interaction between him and his enviroment was stunning.  Orlando Bloom is good as Legolas, but he could never equal the others in the movie. I was upset about the way they used Gimli... he seemed to be there strictly for comic relief. It was nothing like in the book where he killed hundreds of orcs. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan were both very good. However, Monaghan seemed stronger in this film where Boyd was better in Return of the King.<br />This is a must see film for anyone, and should have won best picture. The battle of Helm's Deep has great editing and the cinematography of the film is wonderful. All of the battle sequences are strong, and the plot is rich. Go see it as soon as possible.
B00000JCB2|5.0|i feel that Significant Other is just fantastic from start to finish. i think that it was good for Limp Bizkit to start changing there style, because TRUE artists don't constantly repeat there same sound over and over again on each album. they evolve and experiement with new musical styles despite what all the fans stuck in the past think. i highly recommend this album.10/10
6301955609|5.0|At first viewing, this film may strike one as absolutely bizarre, inappropriate, shocking, disturbing, or otherwise unpleasant, but after digging deeper one may discover a more profound meaning. Santa Sangre is the story of a Central American boy growing up in a carnival, and the impacts that his cult-member mother and adulterous father had on his adulthood. The film rings of protest of U.S. involvement in Central America; United States flags are waved in a funeral procession, the boy's father's costume is a gaudy, star spangled sequined number, and the pre-teen protagonist is given the family tattoo-a red, white and blue eagle-by his father with a knife. The carnival that the boy grows up in is indeed a spectacle among poverty. The clash of pyrite glitz and desperate glamour against a hopeless background of mud caked natives, drug addled amputees, and even the pompous tourists is not lost on the viewer. The dire circumstance that Stockwell captures leaves the viewer sympathetic and remorseful. This is a brilliant, fantastic movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00004XOWM|5.0|okey i'm not really against New Metal, for some reason it in general doesn't bother me. but some of Limp Bizkits albums( this one in peticular) loose their flare very fast. i would recommend just downloading the songs of this album if you really want it because you would be suprised at how fast you loose interest in this stuff. <br />                       3/10
B00003CXV4|1.0|As in The Devil's Advocate, Keanu Reeves in Sweet November tries to play a talented professional who has reached the top of his profession, in this case a successful but heartless advertising executive.  To suggest that Reeves is in over his head is to understate the situation.  The man simply cannot make me believe that he has anything like an I.Q.  His big Hot Dog Advertising Campaign Presentation is one of the funniest scenes in movie history, mainly because one can sense that Keanu is working so very very hard and is failing so very very badly.  It is hysterically funny, just like Elizabeth Berkley's big dramatic tantrums in Showgirls.  It should be common knowledge by now: Keanu Reeves cannot act.  He cannot act.  He cannot act.<BR>Sweet November is a silly little bit of romance that is lifted straight into high-camp heaven, just by casting the inept Keanu Reeves.
0385504209|4.0|I'm not someone who usually reads thrillers, but this one came recommended to me by another someone who isn't a real fan of the genre. I couldn't put it down.<br />The plot's a lot of fun - it really keeps you guessing until the very end - but I enjoyed the historical aspects in particular as well as its lengthy discussions about art, architecture, and the intricacies of the Roman Catholic Church.<br />It makes you want to hop on the next plane to Paris, which is no small commendation.<br />Definitely worth the hype.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This DVD is great.  It has everything a concert DVD should have.  I have watched mostly everything on here.  I think on the Star Profiles there should've been one for Chris Slade (drummer).  They had every member but him.  That's my only regret, though.  If you are an AC/DC fan and you have a surround sound system in your house, this is the DVD for you.  I have never seen a band have a commentary on a concert before.  It has 5.1 Surround Sound for great sound quality.  Go buy this DVD and enjoy!
B000002AAC|4.0|Being 36 now, I was only just turning 12 when this album came out.<BR>So I was too young at the time and dont really care less now about the alleged Disco element.<BR>I just play this album to death. Im so hooked <BR>Its a great album. <br />Suburb stand out songs of Need her love and Midnight Blue.
B00000F14B|5.0|I could wax lyrical about this film for ever but I won't! In my opinion, the greatest movie musical ever produced, 'The Music Man' is lttle heard of in my native Britain.  I caught it when it was shown on TV in the small hours of the morning around 15 years ago and have loved it ever since.<BR>Robert Preston IS Harold Hill and proves that he is a fantastic screen actor whose film credits are depressingly few - although if you haven't already seen it, check out 'Victor/Victoria'.  Shirley Jones gives a performance that, after 'Oklahoma!' and 'Carousel', shows that she CAN act!  All of the supporting players are excellent too, with emphasis on Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold (again too few movie appearances) as the Shinns, Pert Kelton as Mrs. Paroo and The Buffalo Bills as The All-Singing All-Harmonizing School Board.<BR>Working much better as a film than a stage show, Meredith Willson's ode to his Iowa childhood is perfectly captured by Morton DaCosta, whose direction is as stagey as it was on 'Auntie Mame' but which fits very well with the slightly unreal nature of the plot.<BR>Musical highlights are virtually every song but a short list would include 'Trouble', '76 Trombones', 'Marian the Librarian' and 'The Sadder But Wiser Girl'.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never purchased a DVD set of a TV show before. I don't really watch many TV programs, but this show is the best TV show I have ever seen. The dialogue is better than any TV show, book, or movie I have ever seen. It is funny, bitter, heartwarming and crushing all at the same time. If I were an actor I would have paid Joss Whedon to let me say his words. My son also wants everyone to know that the music is great. :) Anyway, you should buy this set. It doesn't matter if you like sci-fi or not, if you like westerns or not, it's not about that. It's about the journey of these amazing characters that Joss created. Here's hoping the movie execs take notice and bring this story to the big screen.
6305508550|4.0|The perfect cure to a \\"Case of the Monday's\\" is to come home and immediately pop in \\"Office Space.\\"  No movie has ever helped cope with the dull monotony of your job until now.  The brilliantly hilarious script is brought to life by fantastic performances by Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, and crew.  Many hilarious situations and quotes will have you watching this movie over and over again.  You'll be wishing you had the guts to tell your boss off much like Peter, but this at least lets you know that you're not alone in your hatred for your job, no matter what profession.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This album is amazing.  Although the peas have always been really unique and cool and different this album is solid on its varied sounds, creative samples, and wicked production.  Its right up there as one my fave albums of the year, and the new addition to the group, female vocalist Fergie, really makes the band more marketable but they are still very unique (Which other rap trio has a female vocalist? None).  Plus the guys rapping is audible so you can sing along to both the catchy chorus parts and the rap verses.<br />The album starts off with 5 party-ready tracks, with the opener being \\"Hands Up\\" a track played ont he OC that has a cool vintage feel with its trumpet riffs and electric effects in the chorus.  Then it jumps right into \\"Labour Day\\" a fun dance track with a great chorus to just groove to.  The lyrics are really easy to pick up here.  \\"Lets Get Retarded\\" which isn't a reference in a negative way its about losing control while dancing/partying it up.  I believe this is the third single for the band as I heard it at the bars for the first time the other night.  This is actually the first song that hooked me onto this album as its amazingly catchy with great hooks and lyrics.  This song was also featured on the Fox hit tv show The OC.  The fourth track \\"Hey Mama\\" is a bit Sean Paul inspired and while not quite as danceable has a good beat and is definiately worthy of head-bopping.  After that is the second poppy single \\"Shut Up\\" about two quarreling lovers where the girl accuses the guy of cheating on her.  Fergie really steps out here and makes herself known int he group.<br />Next is the more or less 'title track' of the cd \\"Smells Like Funk\\" which has a really different off-beat tempo to it.  The lyrics are a bit crude but the song is good in a mocking tone, its got a real ol' skool sly funk groove to it. \\"Latin Girls\\" Is quite long but has a good chorus to it...\\"Sexy\\" follows the same lines with a bit of a jazzy/latin background to it, not my fave but quite similar to something you'd hear on the new Outkast album.  \\"Fly Away\\" is really Fergies song to sing a lot, its not bad but its not super fantastic.  Another old school inspired song.  Reminds me of Alicia Keys a bit.<br />The final stretch of the album (which has the biggest range of songs in terms of style) starts with \\"The Boogie That Be\\" which has really grown on me that its one of my fave songs with a really steady Run DMC-esque beat and a good rap beat, as well as a cool chorus.  I especially love Fergies rap-verse.  \\"The APL Song\\" is a classic homage to the 'ghetto' the Peas grew up in, a nice tribute and a cool change of pace from the rest of the upbeatness.  Then we move onto Linkin Park meets Black Eyed Peas with \\"Anxiety\\" which is also growing to be one of my fave songs because its so different.  If the band ever wanted to branch out to a wider audience this might be a cool song to try out as a single.  Finally we finish with the first political-loaded single \\"Where Is The Love\\" an anti-war anthem guest starring Justin Timberlake on the chorus.  Then ther eis the hidden track which is a unique laid-back Jamaican style song which if you ask me, has underlying political motifs...listen closely kids.<br />All in all this is an amazing album and not one to be missed.  Its right up there iwth the best of 2003 in terms of music and presents music that is both ear-catching and unique in terms of style, sound, rhythym and lyrics.  An excellent effort!
0316666343|5.0|I was completely psyched to read this book and was not disappointed at all. A girl named Susie is murdered and has to watch her family and friends grieve from heaven.She becomes a very popular person on Earth as well as Heaven. Her family goes through a lot during her murder, and whatever they feel or do, she feels as well. I could not put this book down, and I would read it again in a second. It was humorous, sad, touching, and really gave you an appreciation for your loved ones. It was an outstanding book.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Overkill with DVD releases is certainly frustrating....you think you have the best version of your favorite movie on DVD that the studio could ever possibly put out already in your collection, and bam! A new, improved, remastered, high quality, new super soundtrack, superbit release is coming out!!! You just have to have it! It replaces anything that has ever been released beforehand......<BR>come on.........how many copies do we have to get before the studios get it right???<BR>Ridiculous, right????<BR>Well, they actually got it right this time ( after quite a few versions released already)...........<BR>Oh well........<BR>I hate to say it.....but this sucker is incredible...immense.....unbelievable.....over 5 ft. long....and heavy!!!! The packaging leaves alot to be desired....I saw a foreign release where they presented it as a book, with pages of DVDs....not the hard to handle, fold out 5 ft. package.<BR>But enough about the package........the insides are a dream come true for any Alien fan....so much material, new versions never seen before, new commentaries, documentaries......I can't list all the goodies packed into this beast. Needless to say, this is highly recommended...<BR>if you get only one special set this year, make it a doozie and get this one...you will not be disappointed....I have only gotten about one tenth of the way through this set, and everything has been above and beyond what any other set has had to offer. (the Lord of the Rings sets are close, and also must haves). No point in getting into the guts of this special set...........all I can do is to let you know that it is worth your hard earned money.....you gotta go get this set. Only sad thing is that David Fincher didn't get involved, but every other filmaker has added a tremendous amount of goodies, and each contributed a special version of their film just for this DVD set. A tremendous job by all, especially Fox......a DVD release they can really be proud of.......<BR>This is truly whatDVD should be about....pristine versions of the films, with super soundtracks, and lots of extras and behind the scenes goodies that you can watch anytime in the comfort of your home.<BR>DVD's rule......and this is certainly a contender for the &quot;king&quot; of DVD releases so far. Ridiculously highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>Did I mention.....<BR>GO GET IT???? A.S.A.P.?????????
B00009L1UP|2.0|[NOTE: This is a repost. Original was posted under the unremastered version of Empire on 1/20/03.]<br />This was my first Queensryche album, so even though I heard a lot of positive reviews on Empire I didn't know what to expect. I was told that Queensryche sounded vaguely like Dream Theater, or a cross between Iron Maiden and Pink Floyd. Sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.<br />Well, after 3 months of trying to appreciate this record, I can say with a fair degree of certainty that Operation Mindcrime is definitely the Queensryche album to get. Mindcrime has everything Empire doesn't--prescence, raw energy, great songwriting and lyricism, and of course an engaging storyline that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.<br />Empire still exhibits the impressive talents of Geoff Tate and the guitar-songwriting team of Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton. However, Empire is marred by watery ballads and cheesy lyrics that recall Bon Jovi, not Pink Floyd. Adding to the hair/power metal feel is an overly slick commercial production that isn't bad in of itself, but here it adds to the feeling that you're listening to late-'80s glam rock.<br />Not all of the material is subpar-- FM radio hit Silent Lucidity is a nice track, Della Brown is atmospheric and brilliant, Empire captures some of the powerful political commentary of Mindcrime while rocking out quite well, and Is Anybody Listening? contains a great message about the faults of the music industry. That saves Empire from receiving less than two stars (2.5, really).<br />I strongly suggest that all metal listeners add Operation Mindcrime to their collection. Queensryche never topped it from both a commercial and artistic standpoint. After Mindcrime, Empire is an underwhelming record from a band capable of much more.
B00005JM0B|5.0|The Movie is great. I love the actions in it, great <BR>cinematography. Lot's of cool features are on the dvd also.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After finally being able to see all the episodes in the order they were meant to be seen, I am really, really  PO'd at Fox for messing up another brilliant series (remember The Tick, Freaky Links & The Family Guy?). Fox only wants dumb reality shows these days. They cost nothing to produce. They don't have to pay any talented actors, writers or effects shops any money. So until America tunes OUT the reality shows (don't watch them!), amazing shows like this will never have a chance. When you are finished watching this series (I was hooked by episode 2), you will feel the same way. These episodes are not enough. This series should have had a long, long run, just as Whedon's BTVS and Angel. Joss Whedon wants to release a feature film of this series in the next year or two. Let's keep our fingers crossed that this gets done and the person(s) that gave this show the axe will eat crow.
B00015HVI8|5.0|Having grown up with the original Star Trek TV series, plus all of the subsequent movies and other Star Trek television series, I must say that the storyline in the Stargate SG-1 episodes puts Star Trek to shame.<br />Can any Sci-Fi afficionado not be impressed by the originality of the entire Stargate setup, from the effect of seeing a starship come out of hyperspace to the warm feeling one gets when the Asgard (usually represented by Thor) show up and that special music starts playing?<br />This is probably the only TV series in which I'll purchase every season's DVD boxset.
B00008PC2O|4.0|Although it hasn't stopped me from watching the movie about 15 times since its release, I must say that T2 doesn't hold up to scrutiny quite as well as its predecessor or its successor in the Terminator trilogy.  This movie cost about $100 million to make, which is a huge sum today and was even bigger back in 1991.  And while that hefty budget did provide the movie with special effects that were vastly superior to those of the original (no claymation mock-ups of Arnold's face this time out), it detracted from many of the qualities that had made the original Terminator such an intelligent and frightening film.  With so much money to spend on such stunning visuals (and make no mistake, this movie *was* a visual stunner of the highest order), James Cameron and Co. no longer had to focus as much on tiny aspects like atmosphere, characterization, or realism, and in the long run the product suffers as a result.<br />Perhaps the worst part of the movie is the presence this time around of John Connor himself.  If this kid is going to be the savior of mankind, I question whether mankind is even worth saving.  He starts the movie as a grating, whiny-voiced twerp, and he pretty much stays there until the end.  And what's even worse, he takes Arnold down with him, turning a mighty Terminator into a sensitive, new-agey guy right before our very eyes.  I more or less have to avert my eyes during the last five minutes or so, and I'm sure I'm not alone.<br />Ok, enough from the complaint department, now for the good stuff.  I've said a lot already about the special effects, and this movie's hypertrophic budget did enable Cameron to pull off scenes he could scarcely have dreamed of back in 1984.  T2 is highlighted by a succession of stunning set pieces that almost single-handedly revolutionized the action genre.  The chase scenes and shootouts are among the most spectacular ever put to film, and there are even a few old-fashioned beatdowns thrown in for good measure.  Not to mention, this movie sees the completion of Sarah Connor's transformation from hapless would-be victim to bona fide tough chick, complete with plenty of muscle tone and a new-found expertise with martial arts and automatic weapons.  I, for one, think change was for the better in this case.<br />Since T2 was of course a sequel, it was only natural to up the ante in the villain department, and this movie came through in a big way.  The original Terminator was a scary enough killing machine, and in T2 we get not only the return of Arnold, but an even more frightening &quot;bad&quot; Terminator in the form of the T-1000.  Made of an ultra-futuristic liquid metal (try not to think whether such a thing is scientifically feasible), the T-1000 slices and dices its way through unsuspecting humans with such efficiency it makes Arnold's old-school T-800 seem like a cuisinart.  And while Robert Patrick is nowhere near as imposing as Arnold, nor as easy on the eyes as T3 villainess Kristanna Loken (well, duh), he did manage to perfect the steely glare that the role required.<br />In the end, T2 is a much more than satisfactory viewing experience.  It doesn't have the malevolent mood of the original, and it's not quite as intelligent as the latest (last?) installment, but for grandiose action it hardly gets better than this.  The movie also further develops the trilogy's emphasis on fate and free will, with more intimations of the future horrors that await mankind if we continue on our present course.  The intimations of impending apocalypse are kept largely off-screen, but despite (or perhaps because of) that fact, it may be most frightening of all.tion, this movie sees the completion of Sarah Connor's transformation from hapless would-be victim to bona fide tough chick, complete with plenty of muscle tone and a new-found expertise with martial arts and automatic weapons.

B00012FXB8|5.0|I will admit the original theatrical Alien3 wasn't that great, it was horribly edited with crappy sound. But the 2003 special edition fills in all the gaps. It is now one of the best Alien films. I couldn't believe how much better this movie was after over 30 minutes were added to it. The movie even gives a whole new plot line between Ripley and Clemens. Even the alien story line is different and better where now the alien is shown coming out of an ox rather than the dog. All I can say is this movie is great and all those who didn't like it before should give the special edition a spin. It is garanteed to restore your faith.
B000002UYZ|3.0|The only reason to get this collection instead of the individual albums is that this is the only place you'll find many of The Beatles' early hits remixed in stereo.  All of the early albums were mostly in mono, so some remixing was done to get what is on the red album (the same was true of the LP).  If you can live without the stereo remixes, the get the original albums.
0385495323|5.0|Simon Singh has written an outstanding introduction into cryptology (the science of codes, ciphers and decoding and decyphering).  This is a book aimed at the layperson who has some interest in mathematics and linguistics.  He mixes the science behind codes and cyphers with a stronhg dose of history, which puts the amazing achievements in this science in the context of changing human history.<br />The history in the book ranges from Roman codes through the middle ages and finally arriving to the 2nd world war and the Enigma machine.  Not only is the history told in great detail, but also with some attention the reader understands exactly the process that was taken to arrive at the cyphers and their breaking.  An addition portion of history told is that of the decyphering of hieroglyphics and Linear B, ancient forms of writing on which some of the tools of cryptology (especially mathematics and linguistics) were used.<br />Simon Singh uses a formula similar to the one he uses in Fermat's Enigma (another outstanding book for amateur mathematicians): he tells a story on a subject that is tremendously complex, but makes it simple enough so that someone who is dedicated to understanding it can at least grasp the main concepts.<br />This is a great book for amateur mathematicians, statisticians and linguists.  It is also a great portion of our history that is seldom heard of.  I highly recommend it as one of the best page turners I have read in a while.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|UNDERWORLD is being horridly underrated.  Those who were looking for \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" are furious.  I myself found the film to be better than I expected.  UNDERWORLD is an extraodinary BLADE-esque horror/thriller with similarities to both BLADE and THE MATRIX.  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire \\"Death Dealer\\".  Her job is to eleminate any and all Lycans (werewolves), who have been at war with the vampires for a millenia.  But her determination wavers when she meets a newly-made Lycan (Scott Speedman) who has been unsuspectingly drawn into this ages-old battle.  Things aren't as they seem, or so Selene soon discovers; and thus begins one of the greatest battles of all history.  UNDERWORLD belongs in the rows of horror wonders.  It is outstanding.  The direction is terrific and occasionally artful; the soundtrack is good; the acting is great; and the effects are terrific.  The story is also an awesome idea and is brought out well.  There's also a very cool Lycan transformation scene reminiscent of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  The only way to know how good the film is is to watch it.  I strongly recommend that you rent this horror wonder as soon as possible; believe me, it's worth it.  UNDERWORLD is one delicious bite of horror cinema that you'll be howling about for days on end.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot for many reasons, but have to say that I can understand those who might have a different opinion. I think it somewhat depends on your ability to connect with the sense of alienation in a strange city and also, how much the two main actors have managed to capture your heart. They did capture mine. <BR>I experienced \\"Lost in Translation\\" as a movie about alienation - not only in a foreign, different city but also the feeling of alienation in your \\"home\\" or amongst those who are supposedly the closest to you. How suddenly in a different place, which makes you a lot more vulnerable, Charlotte's husband becomes a man she is not sure she knows. I also think that the movie has a very strong declaration about the total alienation of human kind at the face of technology - or so I understood it.<BR>This is a story of two people lost in Tokyo. Tokyo is both ugly and captivating in this movie and you feel so very tired...The main characters are suffering severe Jet Lag but I assume they are also mentally tired from all the sights and sounds (there are several scenes filmed inside a sort of video game arcade which holds hundreds of noisy stations) and the need to try and figure everything out, even the most trivial things (such as having a shower).<BR>Later in the movie I understood Tokyo to also be a symbol of human alienation everywhere. Off course Tokyo is an easy symbol as the Japanese culture is so totally different. Size, food and humor are so different -- but the movie is not about Tokyo, only the feeling that Tokyo gives you.<BR>Two people lost in a foreign city and in their personal lives are able to reach a high level of friendship. It is very interesting to note that the director made this relationship one of friendship that is very expressly in a higher level then sex. As if not to jeopardize or make the friendship \\"dirty\\" in any sort of way. In fact, when Bob does have a sexual encounter, it is portrayed as something he regrets (accordingto his behavior, not words).<BR>Bill Murray's dry, cynical sense of humor is not lost in this movie and is totally fitting the character he plays. Bob Harris is a tired person, who is not only jet lagged but also a little tired of the life he is leading. Scarlett Johansson plays a smart, cynical young college graduate (\\"Not everyone studied in Yale\\", says her husband) who is amazed from the feeling of loneliness she already holds in such an early stage in her life. <BR>The encounter and friendship of these two people lasts only a few days and does not have any future, but manages to reach high levels of closeness, which as always seems to be the only answer to alienation.
B000002HRE|1.0|After promising for months during pre-release interviews that &quot;Reload&quot; would not be simply leftover material from &quot;Load&quot; (although the songs were written during the same sessions), the album eventually dropped to a misinformed public.  &quot;Reload&quot; sounds like absolutely nothing else EXCEPT material that wasn't good enough for inclusion on the already spotty &quot;Load&quot; album.  <br />The opening track, &quot;Fuel&quot;, was one of the album's biggest hits and current live faves, but both lyrically and musically it finds Metallica sinking further and further into dimwitted neanderthal rock.  The James Hetfield that used to pen such masterpieces as &quot;Fade to Black&quot; and &quot;Blackened&quot; is now reduced to such tripe as &quot;Gimme fuel/Gimme fire/Gimme that which I desire/Oooh!&quot; (how could that possibly have passed the drawing board stage?) Even though the song does boast what's indisputably one of the catchier riffs on the album, it's bar band simplicity and the blockheaded lyrics mar it beyond favor.<br />Of the other singles released from &quot;Reload&quot;, &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; sounds like Metallica merely going through the motions, despite the fact that they've only been playing in this style for one album now.  The &quot;la la la&quot; vocals by Marianne Faithfull are a horrendous misstep; I defy fans of the song to deny that they wouldn't prefer a version without Faithfull's contributions.  As for the other big &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot; is nothing more than a crass attempt to cash in on the success of a far superior song.  Metallica are shrewd businessmen and realize that most people tend to prefer the first material they encounter by a band, which is why you see so many of the positive reviews for the latter albums obviously written by teenagers and other youth - the younger they are, the less likely they are to have heard the original &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, and once they've decided the sequel is a good song they're unlikely to admit to a hasty judgment later and downgrade their opinion of the sequel.  At best you tend to get a &quot;they're both cool in their own way&quot; response.  <br />Finally, one of my main complaints with &quot;Reload&quot; (and a prime indication of why it seems like a rush job) is that the solos on the album sound like they were all recorded during one long, self indulgent jam session, then chopped up indiscriminately and inserted into the finished tracks at random.  There's not a single solo that sounds like it was handwritten for a particular song, and by about 3 songs into the set you already develop a &quot;been there done that&quot; immunity to Kirk Hammett's remaining efforts.  &quot;Reload&quot; is the only album to date that I would rank decidedly below even &quot;St Anger&quot;, and should probably be the last stop on a neophyte's list of Metallica albums.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|I really like Britt's new CD.  She has some great songs there, tow of my favorite being Toxic, and Boom Boom.  If you're a dancer then this is a CD that you sould definitely consider getting.  It has some great songs to dance to, and make up a choreography for.
B000003TAB|4.0|People who say Nirvana's music is unaccessable (in particuar, Bleach and their early demo recordings of January 1988) for pop listeners just want to have Nirvana all to themselves. Most Nirvana fans are quite sellfish like that. It makes them feel special to think they have something secret all to themselves, when in reality, millions of people like me love the band and own all their albums including the &quot;inacessable&quot; Incesticide. This album in question is a compilation of covers, B-sides, and demos Nirvana did between 1988 and 1992. Bottom Line: If you like Nirvana at all, you'll like Incesticide. Despite how many have commented Incesticide flows smoothly from song to song, it doesn't at all. Every song has about the same amount of audial quality except the mushy, murky Dive and Stain. I don't care for either one. These two songs sound so similar it's hard to tell the difference. Even though they were recorded years apart, Kurt's singing voice is as coarse and grainy as sandpaper, and no, it's not &quot;beautiful&quot;. He always had a slight raspiness to his voice that was quite endearing, kind of like the friendly yet worn-out guy you knew from across the way.  But here he doesn't sound like his floaty heroin-doped self. As for the rest, they're very good for hardcore and casual fans alike. In Turnaround, Kurt's voice is very animated, which is a nice change from his usual lazy mumbling. Son of a Gun is uncharacteristically happy and sweet. The January '88 demos aren't anything Nevermind fans wouldn't like. The demos are not any more strange or experimental than the rest of the songs Cobain wrote. One of those demos, Hairspray Queen, has one of the most creative bass lines I've ever heard from a Nirvana song. Big Long Now is very boring, much in the same way Sifting is. Cobain should've included it on Bleach; nobody would've noticed it amongst the dullness of the second half of the record. It would've fit perfectly. The closing song, Aneurism, is supreme.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The first ablum that I have bought in a long time that I can listen to all the way through.  The song writing is nothing less than poetry.  The singing is awesome.  The music is great.  The whole album is tight.  There is a strong spiritual overtone to the whole album.  Some say it is just Soundgarden with a different band, but as a Soundgarden fan, I can tell you that Audioslave will be a more significant band than Soundgarden or Rage.
B000002LK1|5.0|In the latter half of the eighties, Depeche Mode were truly finding their voice, and the &quot;For the Masses&quot; tour (culminating with the Rose Bowl show which would become 101) showed that a lot of people were listening.  However, although DM had a strong underground following, they had not yet had anything resembling a chart-busting album.<br />Violator changed all of that.  Everyone and his godmother has heard &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; or &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; by now, songs that very quickly became iconic for the band.  Even people who don't like the &quot;Depressed Mods&quot; will admit to an affinity for that infectiously twangy guitar riff in &quot;Personal Jesus.&quot;  Like REM's Out of Time, The Cure's Disintegration, or Metallica's Black album, Violator at once brought DM to the mainstream and became the band's definitive work.<br />It's easy to categorize Violator as a &quot;dance&quot; album, particularly since several of the songs are carried by faster beats than would be typical of Music for the Masses or Black Celebration.  &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; is a particularly entrancing, arousing experience, perfect for getting close to someone.  But to write off Violator as a sell-out &quot;dance&quot; album really does not do justice to these nine rich, dark, sinfully addictive tracks.  The radio-friendly stuff is even better here since the album mixes are longer and more nuanced; check out the extended groove at the end of &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; for example, or the quiet, nightmarish interlude that follows &quot;Enjoy the Silence.&quot;  (The distorted word is &quot;crucified,&quot; for those who care.)<br />More importantly, though, the tracks that did not become singles are just as strong as what you've heard on the radio.  &quot;Clean&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Perfection&quot; both draw attention to the perils of drug addiction, and each brings its own narcotic rush to the listener.  &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; study infidelity from different angles, neither of which is particularly optimistic.  &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; creates probably the most intense atmosphere of any Depeche Mode song ever written.  Turn the lights off and the sound up on a moonlit night and let yourself drift into these six eerie minutes of oblivion.  And as with &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; on Black Celebration, &quot;Blue Dress&quot; provides Martin Gore's vulnerable counterweight to Dave Gahan's lusty baritone.<br />Violator finds Depeche Mode at the peak of their career and the zenith of their creative abilities (the image of King Dave on a lonely mountaintop in the &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; video is very fitting).  They did not make a better album before or since, and it's doubtful that they ever will.  More cohesive than Music for the Masses and better executed than Black Celebration or Songs of Faith and Devotion, Violator is one of the few truly flawless albums I can think of.  Five stars are simply not enough for Depeche Mode's magnum opus.; study infidelity from different angles, neither of which is particularly optimistic.  &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; creates probably the most intense atmosphere of any Depeche Mode song ever written.

B0000C9V3T|3.0|This soundtrack is both really amazing and really disappointing. There are enough songs on it to make it worthwhile, however:<BR>1. There are probably about 20 minutes (3-6 songs) that are left off that are in the movie. They're all really cool songs too.<BR>2. Instead you get a bunch of little shorts and sound effects. okay, maybe thats cool, but does it belong on a soundtrack??? (eg. a 10-second track of &quot;axe throw&quot;)<BR>3. So all in all, you get about 30 minutes of good music. So buy the CD cheap.
031218087X|3.0|I have so far read 4 of Dan Brown's books (Angel &amp; Demons, DaVinci Code, Deception Point &amp; Digital Fortress) and three features of his writings stand out. First, audacious plotlines; Brown does not believe in small measures but goes out on a limb. The plotlines are way over the top but have just that crucial amount of credibility to draw in a reader, even when he knows it is fiction. Second, the pace is mercilessly quick; the entire plot of the book plays out over a few days at most. Last but for me the best of all, his books have a wealth of esoteric information that one would not normally read about. I found myself enthralled by a never ending series of factoids that had me rushing to the Internet for explanation or elaboration. <BR>Digital Fortress follows the above lines. A quick capsule : Set with a cryptographic background, it describes a battle of wits between a governmental agency focused on breaking codes (used by good and bad guys alike in order to forestall terrorism) with a former employee who passionately believes in individual privacy. In a rapid-fire series of thrust and counter-thrust, the action cuts between Washington and Madrid with the standard does of blood, explosions and romance. Unlike Brown's other novels, this is very undemanding of a reader's intelligence - the average reader will see the signposts well before the protagonists themselves. <BR>Sadly, there are flaws aplenty that seriously impact the plot credibility. Apart from the likelihood of an amateur professor being used as a proxy agent, the ease of the bypassing of the Gauntlet anti-virus software, particularly when Gauntlet safeguards not only TRANSLTR but also the databank is simply not possible. In such a situation there would be multiple layers of safeguards, not just a single bypass attributable to a single individual no matter how senior. More to the point, having raised the whole issue of individual privacy vis--vis governmental oversight, Brown never follows throughon the implications. A pity, as this is of key topical importance as well.<BR>Nevertheless, this is a good weekend read when you want to just enjoy a story and not get too caught up in the process. Three stars for that, with a star each subtracted for the plot credibility lapses and inadequate research.
B000005J56|5.0|This is a great album. It offers some of the best Cuban music to date. I've enjoyed it over and over again. It contains many of the classic Afro-Cuban songs, and Cuban folk music I grew up with in Havana (I lived there from birth to age fifteen). It is amazing how Ibrahim Ferrer's voice renders this timeless music even more unforgettable. If you enjoy this album, please be sure to check out other old time Cuban artists like Beny More. He was nicknamed \\"El Barbaro del Ritmo,\\" literal translation, 'The greatest of the rythym.' Some good choices include CDs like \\"Serie Platino: 20 Exitos,\\" and \\"The Very Best of Beny More & His All Star Afro Cuban Big Band, Vol. 1.\\" In fact, a couple of the songs in Buena Vista Social Club are originals of Beny More. You may also want to check out a group called 'Trio Matamoros.' Ditto for their music. A couple of the Buena Vista songs are originals of this group, one that comes to mind is \\"Lagrimas Negras.\\" I hope you enjoy the Buena Vista Social Club CD as much as I do. Don't forget to check out the other artists I mentioned. Amazon.com has a great way to let you sample music from these artist CDs before you buy.

B0000033P0|5.0|This is ELP becoming who they were and what they would eventually progress toward on Brain Salad Surgery. Many people don't like the second side, but I actually get a lot out of them. The Tarkus Suite is the main focus though. As a new ELP fan, I'd say start with Trilogy or self-titled, but this should not be overlooked.
0792833236|4.0|In 1980, it is famously recorded that the real Jake LaMotta walked out of the movie theater where he had just seen the completed &quot;Raging Bull&quot; for the first time, turned to his ex-wife, who was also invited, and whined, &quot;I wasn't that bad, was I?&quot;<br />&quot;No,&quot; she deadpanned. &quot;You were worse.&quot;<br />It is hard to imagine anyone being worse than Robert DeNiro's version of LaMotta. Hot-tempered, violent, masochistic, treacherous, pathologically jealous, Bobby D plays just an all around horrible human being, one with almost no redeeming value at all save for his ability to withstand punishment in the ring. And indeed, it is this last quality that offers Jake a place where he can come to grips with his demons in a legal and fairly lucrative way, as he quests for a shot at the middleweight title.<br />The era that the real Jake LaMotta competed in was one of the most interesting in history. Boxing was at the height of its popularity and the 160-pound division was loaded with talent, including Michele Cerdan and the great Sugar Ray Robinson, but it was also a time when the Mob, in the personage of Frankie Carbo, largely controlled access to the title. Fight outcomes were sometimes fixed, odds were skewed, bribes were offered and taken, dirty tricks were played, and some otherwise honest men had to look the other way to get what they had already earned on merit. The scene in the film where the mobster Tommy tells Jake's brother &quot;There's no way he's getting a title shot without us&quot; is not far-fetched.<br />Jake's reluctance to play ball with the mob, who he considers cowards, is one of the few ethical things he does in the film; but in the end he gets in bed with them, throwing a fight with a hapless opponent and enduring disgrace and suspension of his license so he can take on Michele Cerdan for the title. By that time, the real LaMotta later said, &quot;I knew in the dressing room I was gonna be champion; nobody could have beaten me that night.&quot;<br />He probably wasn't wrong. LaMotta, in real life, had no punch (unlike the movie, where he tears opponents to peices) and relied on his boxing ability and brick chin to wear down his opponents and win decisions on points. When he was in the zone, he was damn hard to beat; he handed Sugar Ray Robinson his first defeat and nearly knocked him out doing so. However, he was just a bit too big in the frame to fit comfortably into the middleweight division, and a bit too small to make the light heavyweight limit of 175 pounds. Thus he had to starve himself recklessly between fights to make 160, which often left him with nothing in the gas tank down the stretch of grueling 12 and 15 round fights. His brutal defeat at the hands of Ray Robinson in the 13th round of their sixth and final match, which he had been winning on points, is a good example of this. And like a lot of fighters who have to kill themselves to make weight, he had a tendency to balloon up enormously between bouts, a habit which probably shortened his career.<br />All this outside the ring drama, this weight gain and weight loss, this constant pressure to perform did not help his mental state, and DeNiro does a masterful job of showing how the same qualities which made LaMotta successful as a fighter ultimately wrecked him as a person. We know within 10 minutes that this man has almost no chance of living a normal life outside of boxing, and we are not wrong. The part of the film which follows the fat, lonely, broken-down LaMotta through levels of disgrace and humiliation is every bit as grueling as the scenes where he wars in the ring. Only at the very hend, through (sort of) repentance and a refusal to give up, does the man, and the audience, find any peace. His last words to the victorious Sugar Ray, mumbled through busted lips from a state of half-consciousness, more or less some up the film's ultimate message: &quot;You never got me down, Ray. You never got me down.&quot;<br />In &quot;Raging Bull&quot; Scorsese made one of those movies that transcends its subject and becomes an instant classic, and DeNiro gave one of those performances which stands out even in a career as distinguished and brilliant as his. But it is not for the faint of heart.<br />PS - When asked if he ever actually said &quot;You never got me down, Ray&quot; to Robinson, LaMotta laughed and said, &quot;No, I didn't say that. But it was the kind of thing I would have said, if I could have gotten my mouth open.&quot;<br />PPS - this movie begins one of the great feuds of cinematic history, between Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent. In &quot;Raging Bull&quot; Pesci pummels the hapless Vincent outside the Copa for flirting with Jake's wife. In &quot;Goodfellas&quot; Pesci beats Vincent unconscious, throws him in a trunk, and then stabs him to death. In &quot;Casino&quot; Vincent finally gets his revenge by beating Pesci with a baseball bat and then burying him alive in an Indiana cornfield. I shudder to think what Scorsese is gonna do with these two guys in his next film./>In &quot;Raging Bull&quot; Scorsese made one of those movies that transcends its subject and becomes an instant classic, and DeNiro gave one of those performances which stands out even in a career as distinguished and brilliant as his.

B000002AH1|4.0|Miles Davis' Live-Evil featured his funkiest live work and he'd continue in this direction on the studio album On The Corner. Miles' chops were still at their peak here as his solos on the live tracks are very loud and expressive. The opening track &quot;Sivad&quot; starts out as hard slamming funk before slowing down the tempo to a near crawl while still maintaining its massive groove. &quot;What I Say&quot; is a killer jam and the strongest track here. Sax man Gary Bartz, drummer Jack DeJohnette, guitarist John McLaughlin, and Miles all get a chance to shine here and their solos are outstanding. The live tracks on Disc 2, &quot;Honky Tonk&quot;, and &quot;Inamorata and Narration&quot; continue in the hard funk vein and are driven by DeJohnette and bassist Michael Henderson. Keith Jarrett's organ playing is truly a standout on these tracks. Also worth noting is that the version of &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; here sounds nothing like the studio version on Get Up With It. The studio tracks featured here are hit and miss. The moody &quot;Little Church&quot; and &quot;Gemini/Double Image&quot; are both great tracks, with the latter featuring wicked playing from McLaughlin. However, the moody &quot;Nem Um Talvez&quot; and &quot;Selim&quot; are essentially the same track and take away the momentum of the live material. Nonetheless, this is still a great album and &quot;What I Say&quot; and &quot;Sivad&quot; are among the strongest from Miles' electric era.

B000002KN8|4.0|This CD has a pretty good selection of tracks on it. That's just my opinion, though, because I am more for the early work of DM than the newer darker stuff. Puppets, Boys Say Go!, and Nodisco have basically the same melody line. Go figure.<br />1. New Life- Nice bouncy track. Second strongest song on the album. 5/5<BR>2. Puppets- This gives a concept of a person who controls another person's life. Weird. Gore sings. 4/5<BR>3. Dreaming of Me- This song is the strongest on the album. No wonder it's a single. Strong beat, bubblegum flavored. 5/5<BR>4. Boys Say Go!- Basically just another early DM song. It's got a normal rythm for this period. 3/5<BR>5. Nodisco- A song that is just...hmm, let's move on. 2/5<BR>6. What's Your Name?- A happy song?!? What? The exact opposite of later DM songs. Gahan and Gore sing. 3/5<BR>7. Photographic- Here it starts. It was the first song they did under the name Depeche Mode. The Some Bizarre version was better. It leans more into their darker face, but is still decked out with a fast rhythm and countless synthesizers. Gore sings. 4/5<BR>8. Tora! Tora! Tora!- The weakest on the album, I don't listen to it much. 1/5<BR>9. Big Muff- &quot;Popcorn&quot; for the '80s. Instrumental with lots of synthesized SFX. 4/5<BR>10. Any Second Now (Voices)- It's a strange one. It really doesn't have a point. Dark. 3/5<BR>11. Just Can't Get Enough- It is a great listen. It's got a good rhythm, great vocals by Gahan, and an overall wonderful feel to it. 5/5
B00006879E|5.0|Already being a fan of bands like Dave Matthews Band, Train and REM, I took these guys to heart instantly. It was like looking in a mirror. They dress like me, are energetic like me, but are far more talented than myself. :)<br />Definately a must-have album of the late 03, early 04 season.
B000062X9B|5.0|When my family wasn't pickin and singing we were raised on songs by legends like Johnny Cash. Johnny got better as I grew older and music he made in the last decade of his life was some of his best. Johnny sings a song by fellow redneck legend David Allan Coe on this recording and crawls inside every song and sounds like he lived it.
0380713802|3.0|This was a pleasant breeze of a book on European travel which I read in less than 2 days, actually while travelling back from London. I found some of Mr. Brysons observations on European societies to be insightful and on the money. I especially enjoyed his take on Italian drivers and the Scandanavian penchant for public drunkenness, however his classification of Germans as &quot;fat and arrogant&quot; is probably untrue. Surely Americans are fatter and the French more arrogant, but lets not split hairs.<br />The greatest weakness of Bryson's writing seems to be his overuse of hyperbole in trying to get a laugh. Sometimes he connects, and I did laugh out loud many times in my reading, but most of the time it seems he is trying too hard to be funny. <br />Bryson, being a travel writer, does not seem particularly adventurous or much of a risk taker. He generally sticks to well travelled, touristy places in very safe European cities. He seems to confine himself to museums, churches, city centers and the hotel bar and nothing else. Worst of all, he does not really interact much with the locals which he is making such broad observations about. Aside from ordering food and drink and checking in and out of hotels, Bryson overall seems a timid introvert writing smart alecky comments about people he is not truly trying to understand.
B00005JM20|4.0|Johnny English (the movie) has two kinds of jokes: the see-'em-coming-a-mile-away kind and the sneak-up-on-you kind. The former are usually not so funny, but the scene is usually saved by one or two of the latter coming immediately afterward. For instance, Johnny English (the man) is climbing up a vertical sewer piper and winds up (wait for it) covered in poo - not so funny. Shortly thereafter,<br />[spoiler ahead]<br />English draws his gun and fires a nice little poo bubble<br />[end spoiler]<br />- now that's comedy.<br />English frequently comes off more like a British version of The Naked Gun's Frank Drebin than a bumbling James Bond (a la The Pink Panther's Inspector Clouseau). It's not necessarily bad, but it's been done before (granted, they both have). English does best when he doesn't have his faux suavity engaged and is just trying to get the job done. Co-stars Natalie Imbruglia and John Malkovich do a good job with their roles, as do Ben Miller and the other supporting actors. The Aston Martin DB7 Vantage is a thing of beauty.<br />The DVD itself makes a poor first impression. No chapter card insert accompanies the disc; not a big deal, but it comes across cheaply. Then there's the forced viewing of three movie trailers; fast-forwarding is permitted, but you can't skip directly to the menu - this happens every time you play the DVD and it gets old halfway through the first time. Once you get to the main menu things get better: there are some nice bonus features and the DVD-ROM extras are enjoyable as well.<br />This is a well-played spy farce (not quite a full-on Zucker Bros. spoof). It's predictable at times, but always amusing - and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. Check it out.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|This record is a big dissappointment to me. It doesn't even present &quot;naked&quot;performances the way that it promises. In fact, I would guess that this product is more an answer to the question &quot;what can we put out that's Beatles this year?&quot; rather than a sincere desire to document the original Let It Be concept. On Let it Be -Naked, we hear performances chosen by a couple of young engineers, mistakes edited out in Pro Tools, original live vocals scrapped and more. All of this information is available in the current article in mixonline.com as of January '04. So we are not really hearing the ideas and intentions of anyone connected directly with the recordings. It seems that Sir Paul was not even involved in this process. I imagine that a release of Glyn John's original mixes would be a far more interesting document than this new release. As far as musical interest goes, Phil Spector's version is a lot more interesting and compelling then the Beatles By Committee that we have here.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a shame that the Fox network cancelled this series at what would have been the halfway point of its first season. Given that, however, it is wonderful that the production end of Fox Entertainment gave the show a second life on DVD. These 14 episodes are incredibly creative, and if they had been given a chance (both in scheduling and longevity) I think the Asian/Western Techno/Antiquarian fusion thing really would have caught on and we'd be eating Southwestern Eggrolls at Chili's (oh, wait...).<br />The cast initially appears to be the standard stereotypical mix of characters (fighters, mechanics, doctor, etc.) and a typical PC mix of white and black characters. After viewing the show a few times you realize that these are *individuals* (the amazon warrior-woman is the geeky pilot's devoted wife; the psycho fighter has a penchant for unfortunate headgear choices; the doctor, far from playing God, has no personality at all; the man of God has a mysterious past (okay, the prostitute with a heart of gold is cliché, but she also has unexpected depth)); and ethnicity is never an issue - no one is ever referred to by race, nor is the mixed-race marriage ever mentioned - and everyone swears in Chinese. <br />Like the characters, the stories are also complex. Rarely do they go the way you expect them to, and they frequently have two or three plot twists along the way. The dialogue is top notch with very little technospeak to complicate things - if the ship breaks down it's due to a carburetor or a compressor or something else where you have idea what it is. Sure, there are occasional plot holes, but for the most part things make sense from the perspective of the main characters. As disappointing as it is to not know what happens next to the crew of Serenity, there are a couple villains (Niska and Saffron) who reprised their roles during the abbreviated season/series who will also be missed. I said it before and I'll say it again: Shame on Fox for canceling this show (and for other networks not picking it up); hopefully sales of this DVD set and the upcoming feature film will rekindle interest.<br />The DVDs themselves are nicely packaged in slimline cases and include a nice set of extras. The commentaries are good as are the documentaries (hearing Ron Glass belly-laugh was unexpected given the characters he played in this show and on Barney Miller). I was surprised by the swearing in the gag reel, mainly because I would have expected it to be in Chinese. Seeing the episodes in Whedon's intended order is also a plus (the original airdates are also noted so you can scratch your head and wonder \\"What was Fox thinking?). The menus tend to lag on my stand-alone DVD player, but run much smoother on my computer.<br />If you're a sci-fi fan you'll like this show. If you're a western fan you'll like this show.  If you want to learn to express yourself colorfully in Chinese you'll love this show. Take Firefly out for a test-drive; you ought to like it - if not, please don't tell the mechanic it's \\"luh suh,\\" she won't be happy.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I've ever read.  It's wonderful!
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code has thrown not only its author, Dan Brown, into literary superstardom, it has also thrown the various topics of symbolism, secret societies, hidden Christian history, and wild theories of the lineage of Christ into a whirlwind of media frenzy.<br />The Da Vinci Code contains many elements that have provoked the Church to wrath and infuriated those opposed to the theories presented here, but for all the information contained in this book it is still just that- a thriller, fiction novel that is expertly written and entertains us for as long as we take reading this book (I devoured it in 5 hours).<br />This book is what I call the ultimate 3P. It contains the 3 &quot;P's&quot; that I consider necessary to a good fiction read.<br />1. PAGE-turner. Dan Brown keeps you literally on the edge of your seat, and sometimes you fall off of it! With high tension, information unfolding at exactly the right place, and your brain nearly exploding you learn so much, it is definitely a page turner.<br />2. thought-PROVOKER. So many ideologies and facts are presented! Dan Brown has done his homework, he is clearly quite the expert in this particular field of writing.  Many will find the ideologies here heretical and offensive. As a Christian reading this book, I took it for what it was- excellent fiction that presented me with a lot I could learn and use, and a lot (ie the lineage, etc.) that I could do without, but that was entertaining in its fictional context.<br />3. PURE excitement. This book was so much fun to read!!! You quickly not only care about the characters, but you care abou the cause they are pursuing. The characters are over the top in their actions and beliefs and that is refreshing and just fun to experience.<br />Overall, very well written. Very fun to read, excellent information provided....but take it for what it's worth. 5 hours (or more) of fun escapism into a fictional world.<br />JK
B00003CXB4|5.0|I've loved the Lion King since I was a little girl.
B000002WPI|5.0|this album is one of the classic albums of time. ask any hip-hop head, ask any rap head, ask anybody. wu-tang's &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers&quot; is ill beyond recognition. very few albums have come close to this album. the lyrics and the flows are perfect. it is completely what New York/East Coast rap is all about, rugged, rough, raw, and dirty. this album is so grimey, it's so raw, unstudio-fied. the sound and quality of this album is what true hip-hop should sound like. there is no quality remasterings and that's the way we like it. wu's wordplay on this album is truely a work of art, they truly were hungry, VERY hungry. their singles &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; and &quot;Portect Ya Neck&quot; aren't commercially sugarcoated either. &quot;Protect Ya Neck&quot; is one ill single with excellent flow by the W. another song to shine a light on is &quot;Da Mystery of Chessboxin'&quot; every hip hop head, or anyon trying to get into hip hop has to listen to this album. it is grimey sounding as far quality comes, vocally, lyrically. this is an unpolished, diamond-in-the-dirt classic wu album. it's album like this that made hip-hop cross over to suburban areas and spread across America like the AIDs epidemic.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Her antics lately have ruined her music for me. I can't even listen to this album because I don't like the two songs that have been released on the radio. They sound like Minnesota music from the 80's. What was/is she thinking or is she?<br />I received this CD as a Christmas gift but will be returning it unopened because she has just gone too far lately. Is this a good role model for our young girls? Haven't they got enough to deal with in every day life without having someone who is out of touch with reality being displayed as a role model? She's trying to be Madonna and certainly cannot fill those shoes because they haven't been vacated yet.
B00005U2LM|4.0|OMIGOD THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!! is what i've been hearing from a lot of my peeps. everybody was complaining about how this album was too commercial and how wu sold out. well, on one hand, that is true. this album is very commercial sounding, it's not grimey anymore. it sounds like the Wu was running this record 10 blocks from the shaolin slums at some corperate office. musically it's kind of annoying with all the uptempo hee-hee la-la garbage. lyrically they are still tight. now, let me justify all. back on the one hand, the wu didn't sell out. this album show's a real big growth from the company. they have done the grimey shaolin slum hoodrat thing, they've done the ill rich-but-still-hood thing, i guess this album is rich-now-we-do-what-we-want. not a completely bad album, this album will appeal to others who otherwise wouldn't have listened to wu because it has pop appeal. this album just shows that wu can do more than one thing, they can expand and take over the world. iron flag truly, they planted it and conquered the commercial world of hip hop. if you are a REAL wu fan you'd buy it. if you are here and there with wu or just want a wu album, borrow it first. if you don't know who wu are and don't like grimey stuff, get this one along with &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers.&quot;
B0000640VO|5.0|Artistic, Entertaining and Very Well Scripted...If you haven't seen this one before... get it! You'll be watching this one over and over and over again... a true classic.
B00008AWOD|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is one of the best of 2003. It is an album that you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping one song. It is packed with raw emotion. With some of the most beautiful songs, it leaves you feeling haunted. Every song is it's own, not one song sounds the same. Placebo is by far one of the best bands out there.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Talk about music that hits you smack in the face without apologies!  This album challenges today's instant-gratification-searching-youth to actually stop and think...I love it.  I was made a fan of this genial band the minute I first heard their single &quot;intertiatic esp&quot;.  Now, I cannot get enough of their album and its roots, and I now want to learn as much as I can about not only the band and its history, but also about the music's message.<br />For anyone who is contemplating buying the album...do it...it will change everything you thought about music, and it will change your life...
0380729407|1.0|If there was a rating for zero stars, this book deserves it. I've never read anything so awful. If I didn't have to read it for school, I wouldn't have gotten past the 1st chapter. Hard to understand, slow moving, and plain old boring are just a beginning of all the things I hated about this book. As for everyone else in my class, they all hate it too. I'm about to form a petition against it.
0780626966|4.0|First of all I love the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.  The movies did not disappoint me, but the special features did.  It seemed like there were no special features to any of the movies and the ones that are on the CDs were made up after the movies had been produced and this concept of having special features on DVDs became popular.  If you are a fan of the Freddy movies I definitely recommend this movie collection, but you may be disappointed at the special features.
B000002I2M|4.0|I give this album only 4 stars because no Doors album, by itself, is 5-star worthy. However, The Doors' catalog is greater than the sum of its parts; hence, their entire collection deserves 5 stars, without question.<br />THE POSITIVES: The album is a great blues &amp; rock combination. The Doors played a good amount of blues on the road, and this album finally captures some of that. Morrison's voice is much more gruff-sounding and deep (he sang while in the bathroom on some of the songs, and was smoking 2 packs a day at the time) and the band's sound is more refined, overall. As with 'Morrison Hotel', 'L.A Woman' sounds nothing like the first 3 albums; gone are the special sound effects and over-dubbing (which certainly had their place in the earlier albums). While listening to 'Riders on the Storm', keep in mind that this was the last song on the last album from Jim Morrison. Eerie.<br />THE NEGATIVES: L'America seems out of place, and is generally not a very good song. Crawling King Snake is ok, but it drags at times and isn't nearly as solid as it was when they performed it live.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Aliens series and have been waiting patiently for all of them to come out in a boxed set.  This boxed set is awesome, not only does it have all of the great Alien movies but it also includes bonus material on every single movie there is.  So not only does it have four great movies, but it also has great DVD features.  I had read a review on the quality of the DVDs.  I recommend this set to any Alien fan.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this CD when it was first released, and after almost three years it's still in my stereo like once a week. I figured Mayer deserved a review from me for keeping me so entertained.<br />The actual sound of the album is pretty mellow - basically acoustic with Mayer's rough vocals. The first time I listened, I thought all the tracks sounded too similar and I almost regretted buying the album. But then I started paying attention to the lyrics, and the boy was in my head. Seriously. Mayer's lyrics are remarkable in the way that they perfectly capture whatever situation he's addressing, and his tunes are catchy to boot. The songs really don't sound much alike after a few listens. Here's my breakdown:<br />No Such Thing - first single, drew me to the album, and in spite of its being way overplayed on the radio I still really like this one. I love the subject of breaking away from what &quot;they&quot; expect.<br />Why Georgia - &quot;the kind of morning that lasts all afternoon&quot;. Stellar lyric...I can't explain it precisely, but I've had those days. Also this song always makes me want to go on a road trip.<br />My Stupid Mouth - This song cracks me up, though it's not my favorite musically. You can just hear the annoyance in his voice that the girl won't cut him some slack. Mayer's got a sense of humor.<br />Your Body is a Wonderland - Interestingly, this single probably got more airplay than &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; and the overplay kind of ruined it for me.<br />Neon - I like this one. Nifty guitar lick at the beginning.<br />City Love - Not a big fan of this one. Maybe my least favorite track. But redeemed by the lyric, &quot;she keeps a toothbrush at my place / as if I had the extra space.&quot;<br />83 - Mayer captures nostalgia for childhood perfectly. There are days when I would give my right arm to go back to the simplicity of being six years old.<br />3x5 - If you need a reason to buy this album, find this song on iTunes and pay attention to both the music and the lyrics. This track is absolutely fantastic. Sample lyric: &quot;Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way with words.&quot; Who is this guy?<br />Love Song for No One - My other favorite song. Anybody who's been single for an extended period of time will absolutely relate to that feeling that sometimes washes over you - &quot;I'm tired of being alone / So hurry up and get here.&quot;<br />Back to You - Great to sing along to, though nothing oustanding.<br />Great Indoors - Another one I didn't notice until the lyrics caught my ear recently. &quot;Bet you didn't even know / Depends on how far out you go / The channel numbers change.&quot; Love it.<br />Not Myself - interesting topic, kind of a moody feel.<br />St. Patrick's Day - Nice, mellow closer for the album.<br />Overall? This took some time, but Room for Squares is undoubtedly one of my favorite CDs in my collection, and I play it through (without skipping) quite often. The lyrics make it one of those albums you can actively listen to - you don't have to be doing anything else. The new album, Heavier Things, is an entirely different style and personally I much prefer this one. And no, I don't think he sounds like Dave Matthews, except maybe a little in his actual vocals...the songs as a whole have a completely different quality.<br />Side note: if you have a chance to see this guy live, do it. Jams, stories, covers of classics - all the extras you don't get on a studio album that make a concert worth the ticket price.
B000002J1Y|5.0|it is worth paying the money just to get the first disc in this 2 disc set. The introduction, despite the less than perfect sound quality, is a tremendous symphonic piece that gets one &quot;pumped up&quot; and leads beautifully into what is probably one of the best, if not the best, songs on the album, Siberian Khatru. Song after song is amazing and the sound quality, save the intro, is fantastic. It is the best cd in my collection and i highly recommend it to everyone.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I am getting sick of trying to check on the 2nd season's release on the web and accidentally seeing spoilers about what's already happened! I refuse to increase the outrageous cable rates by adding HBO to my already too expensive basic cable. Why is every other TV series released like crazy except this one??!! Come on already, HBO! If you make the public angry enough, they might just say forget about it. Oh and since this is a review- well, I loved Season One- wish I could get a CHANCE to say the same about the second season!
0920668372|5.0|my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer in september 2003.  when she told me, she told me that it was ok to cry because she was still the mommy and i was still her baby.  december she went into the hospital and a month later the doctors told us that they didnt expect her to make it through the night.  that night i squeaked out the song from this book.  a tear came to her eye, which was the most response wed seen from her in 2 weeks.  now for those of you who think that this book is perverted or that the author was on drugs, take a step back and think about what youre saying... as a 23 year old woman, i wanted to do nothing more than crawl onto the hospital bed and curl up in her arms and have her tell me everything was going to be ok..  i miss you mommy.. srlbwp 10/10/46 - 01/03/04
B00005JMEW|4.0|After a long wait, Quintin Tarantino's fourth film had arrived at our feet and dazzled our weathered eyes. Far too long have we stood at the theater waitng in lines of people eager to see the next chick flick when finally, to our minds great gratitude, Kill Bill is laid before us. Trully a stunning and wildely entertaining film combining action and art into a modern day \\"grindhouse\\" picture. Allthough lacking in sensational diologue (that was the idea), this movie is a must see for anyone who can understand a \\"good movie\\" and can drag themselves away from \\"love actaully.\\"
0553583182|5.0|Although originally produced over 40 years ago, this version was updated in the Year 2000.  The book is broken down into chapters on Wealth, Health, and Relationships among others.  There are good examples of affirmations in each chapter, but I think that it is best to customize your own affirmations, using the examples in the book as guidelines.  Although controlling your own thoughts through the use of affirmations is a central principle in this book, there is also some good information here with respect to the impact of negative thoughts as well.  The book makes good use of real-life examples which serve to illustrate the central principles.  I have read many works on positive thinking and the use of affirmations, but this is one of the best since it explains the flip-side of negativity and unforgiveness that can sabotage your efforts to improve yourself.  This aspect sets the book apart from the others.  It is also a very smooth and readable resource that goes by quickly, unlike others that can be a struggle to finish.
0786915749|1.0|Sorry, but I do not agree with all the raves about this book.  While I think it would be a good book for a middle school aged or younger child,  I thought it was rather amateurishly written.  After reading The Lord of the Rings, I have a hard time reading anything else with elves and dwarves--They just seem like a cheap rip off.
B000089RVX|2.0|I've got several problems with 'Fallen':<br />1) The album is so overproduced...it sounds too digitized.  I've had people tell me they sound horrible in concert because their studio production was so overdone...I definitely believe that's the case.  The CD sounds so overprocessed.<BR>2) The album was overhyped...that's what happens when you have Sony behind you as a marketing arm.  Sony wanted to jump into the so-called &quot;Goth Metal Melodic&quot; stuff, when Evanescence is average at best and terrible at worst.<BR>3) Amy's singing basically sucks...she has no range compared to Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil...Cristina has range and sings with feeling...Amy doesn't capture that at all.<br />For those of you who want to listen to some &quot;Goth Metal Melodic Rock&quot; stuff (it's hard to describe exactly what it is), pick up any CD by Lacuna Coil.  They've put out several albums and have been doing this for 7 or 8 years...and the Italians do it so much better (yes, they're from Italy).  Their most recent CD &quot;Comalies&quot; is so much better...much more melodic, great singing from Cristina, and it's not overproduced.  I would recommend them, or Opeth, or Nightwish over the overproduced Evanescence.
B000127LW2|2.0|I'm a big fan of Voyager and I think it's the best of the Star treks; however, it only got good after one or two seasons of fans complaining about how much it sucked. This season gave Voyager a bad reputation that it REALLY had to work hard to overcome. For example, if I'm not mistaken, this season contains the episode where the ship escapes through a \\"hole\\" in some object's gravity well. Anyone who is familiar with basic Newtonian physics should realize that this concept is so colossally stupid, it's a miracle that this show ever got the thumbs-up from KBHK (now UPN). The acting was pretty horrible, too. And in the season's gripping cliffhanger finale, Tuvok helps bridge the gap between the Maquis and the rest of the crew by berating the Maquis for their attire, and the ship is threatened by none other than Neelix's bad cooking. While in later seasons Neelix and his questionable culinary skills would prove time and again to be life-threatening for the crew, such stupid plot devices were never used for finales. I guess the writers learned their lesson.<br />Seasons 3-7 of Voyager are awesome. Season 1 isn't.
0385504209|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book, the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. I have read that there are certain inaccuracies, but that did not bother because I know this is fiction. If I want to learn about the real thing I will geta  text book! The games (mind twisters) at the end are kind of silly, so I gave only four stars. But really and honestly, this is a book that you will keep reading. You will say &quot;oh, I will read 10 more pages&quot; and then you will read those and say the same thing again and again because it is very thrilling.
B000001IPL|5.0|I got this album in 1996 on tape, because I didn't have a cd player, and it was one of favorites then, and it's one my favorites now, and I finally have it on cd.  If you are looking for just some good punk, not pop, not old punk, this is definitely the album to get (along with Ixnay on the Hombre).<br />1. Time to Relax: Good intro.<br />2. Nitro (Youth Energy): The song with probably the best riff on the album, and a great song as well.  Nothing bad in this song at all.<BR>Rating: A<br />3. Bad Habit: Heh, an awfully funny song, especially the part in the middle, but to me the best part of this song is definitely the pre-chorus, with that odd mood to it, but it rocks.  The guitar is great in this song, too.<BR>Rating: A<br />4. Gotta Get Away: A slower paced song, but still a really good one.  I personally think Dexter's vocals really shine on this song, and with the great chorus too.<BR>Rating: A-<br />5. Genocide: This song has a great lead going over it before the vocals, and the overall song is great.  It has more of an uplifting mood than some other songs, especially in the chorus.<BR>Rating: A-<br />6. Something to Believe In: Geez, will the array of good songs ever end?  Once again Dexter's vocals are great, and the overall song really flows.<BR>Rating: A-<br />7. Come Out and Play: The biggest hit from this song, and it has a good reason for it.  Just a flat out classic Offspring song.<BR>Rating: A-<br />8. Self Esteem: Wow, the first not so good song, and it's the eighth track!  I just really dislike this song because it is way too commercial for my likings.<BR>Rating: C-<br />9. It'll Be a Long Time: Definitely an underrated song, and displays a good message in it as well.  The only bad part is the seemingly happy bridge.<BR>Rating: B+<br />10. Killboy Powerhead: Definitely a filler, but just because it's a filler doesn't mean its a bad song.  A good riff, but the verse seems lacking.<BR>Rating: B<br />11. What Happened to You?: I love the song, but I hate the ska feeling to it.<br />Rating: B<br />12. So Alone: Now this is a true filler, bad and pointless.  Its just...blah...<BR>Rating: C<br />13. Not the One: Finally, a great song again.  Has another good message about the youth in today's world, and the chorus is great as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />14. Smash: Always save the best for last, and Offspring definitely did!  This is an example of a perfect punk song in my opinion, with the awesome post-chorus riff, and the bridge is just perfect.  Not one thing is bad about this song.<br />Rating: A+
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite Radiohead album even though i think it could have been better.<br />+'s = A lot of depressing songs which i like a lot.<BR>-'s = Too many filers, this would have been a superb album if it didnt have the songs like Pull/Pulk revolving doors and Hunting bears<br />Pact like...-4/5<BR>Pyramid Song - 5/5<BR>Pull/Pulk Revolving doors - 2/5 (filler,would have been better if it was shorter)<BR>You and Whos Army? - 5/5<BR>I might be wrong - 4/5<BR>Knives out - 10/5 (amazingly depressing song, one of my favorites)<BR>Morning Bell(Amnesiac) - 1/5 (the only radiohead song that i just cannot stand, KID A version is much better)<BR>Dollars and Cents - 3/5 (filler)<BR>Hunting Bears - 3/5 (filler)<BR>Like Spinning Plates - 5/5<BR>Life in a Glass house - 5/5
B000002TYK|5.0|I picked up this album on tape in 1995, being a huge Nirvana fan obviously, I expected big things from it.  I lost it in 1996 and finally got it on cd in 2003, so its great to have such an awesome album again.<br />1. This Is a Call: Good opener, with an array of multiple riffs and good singing.  A single, as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />2. I'll Stick Around: Another single, and the best song on the album in my opinion.  Starting with the awesome intro riff, and then the more relaxed verse.  Everything about this song is awesome.<BR>Rating: A+<br />3. Big Me: Yet again a single, and a great video too.  While the song isn't exactly the best album, it's still a good song, and shouldn't be skipped very often.<BR>Rating: B<br />4. Alone+Easy Target: Another good song, with a relaxed verse, and then a fiery and strong chorus which is the highlight of the song.  Not to skipped.<BR>Rating: A<br />5. Good Grief: The lead guitar in this song is great, with the more depressing mood all throughout the track.  Another great rock song.<BR>Rating: A-<br />6. Floaty: An absolutely brilliant intro really marks this song for me.  A great song, with some good riffs and good singing by Dave.<BR>Rating: A-<br />7. Weenie Beenie: This could have been a killer song in my opinion had Dave sung normally instead that screaming effect, especially with the great guitar riffs all throughout the song.<BR>Rating: B+<br />8. Oh, George: A slower song, this is where the album starts to go into a somewhat decline, but not much.  Not exactly my favorite on the album.<BR>Rating: B<br />9. For All the cows: A much different song from anything else on the album, but it is a great song.  The thunderous chorus is definitely a highlight of this album.<BR>Rating: A-<br />10. X-Static: I don't know why, but I have never grown to like this song at all.  This one is slower as well and sounds somewhat similar to Exhausted, at the end of the album.  I think its just too standard.<BR>Rating: B<br />11. Wattershed: This one definitely has a killer riff to start it off, and then some great riffs as well after that.   Probably the most energetic song on the album, and is one that I never skip.<BR>Rating: A+<br />12. Exhausted: I would probably like this song a lot more if it wasn't for that static effect all throught the track.  It still has a decent riff, though.<BR>Rating: B
B000002JEV|4.0|I think this is the best Zeppelin release to date. While How The West Was Won is nice, I prefer the BBC Sessions. I am however alittle disappointed at this release. On The live version of &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; on disc 1 theres a segment that was edited out, but my main disappointment is on disc 2. The show from April 1st 1971 on disc 2 is amazing in my opinion but Jimmy Page failed to put the wholer show on this 2 CD set. What Is &amp; What Should Never Be and Communication Breakdown weren't included on disc 2 from that 1971 performance. That live version of Communication Breakdown was smokin and a better live version than on disc one. But, over all, I really like this CD. Led Zeppelin sound young, fresh and full of energey. In my opinion, this is a better release than How The West Was Won.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|While this CD may be good for dancing purposes, it has no depth in terms of lyrics and the vocals are very weak artistically to call the two girls who pretend to lead a gay lifestyle for publicity purposes singers.
6305320802|2.0|As many others have stated, the picture quality on this DVD is terrible, much worse than the other O &amp; H musicals which Fox released in the same series. At times, it looks more like an MPEG movie than a DVD. Save your money until they bring out a restored &quot;collectors&quot; edition.<BR>Shame on you, Fox, for wasting people's money!
B00008WT5E|5.0|You'll notice that nearly every review here at Amazon.com states this as being AC/DC's best album, yet it is also their least known album.  Strange, huh?  Well, the folks here speak the absolute truth.  Powerage IS AC/DC's BEST ALBUM EVER.  It's un-freakin'-believable.<br />Riff Raff/Sin City is arguably the best 1-2 punch in rock music history.  In fact, after acquiring this album, Riff Raff has taken the throne as my personal favorite AC/DC song...I can't get enough of it.  I also really dig Gone Shootin' (too-cool blues riff...goosebump city, baby), Kicked in the Teeth, Sin City, &amp; Whats Next to the Moon.  That's not to put anything against the other songs on this album, as it truly rocks from beginning to end to beginning to end to beginning to end (you'll want to have your CD-player's repeat function engaged for this disc).<br />6 stars &amp; crank it to 11!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I am not a country music person although listening to it doesn't bother me either.  I had heard that the song &quot;Hurt&quot; was a good one from a friend so I decided to buy the album.  OH MY GOD!  What a great song it is!  Johnny is so pure and so sad sounding yet so strong and defiant in this song that I cried when I first heard the entire song.  You will too!  Not all the songs on this album are great but the first two songs certainly made it worth it to me...  <br />When you listen to the song, go into a quiet room with a good set of headphones and you will feel just like you're with Johnny Cash....  So sad, so powerful, so truly felt....<br />Buy this!
B00008PW2E|5.0|someone give SFU an award.  STupid Emmy!!!!  SFU only won 1/41 Emmy nominations.  How sad is that?  I refused to watch the Emmy after SFU's second big loss.  SFU is the second best drama on TV ever, after the Sopranos.<br />Comon people, HBO releases their DVD box set yearly.  The first was released in Feb, then the second will be in FEb.<br />Look at The Sopranos, they released the DVD every August.<BR>Sex and the City, every May.<br />be patient, you're getting there, Feb is just around the corner.<br />Anyway, I'd give the second season 9/10 if the first season is 10/10.  The wit, the drama, the shock, the controversy are all there.  I love it when Patricia Clarkson told Ruth to back off.  I love it even more when the fight between Brenda and Nate erupted.  Men, the acting is AMAZING.  The dialogues are so smart.  Hang in there people, Season 2 is coming.
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies, because it truly understands the hearts of grown up girls, their love of fantasy and lure the dark & dangerous lad that leads us down the garden path.  It's a wonderful tale, with marvellous tunes that linger on and on.  From \\"It's Only Forever\\", \\"Underground\\" and \\"Chilly Down\\" but most especially \\"As the World Falls Down\\".  Sigh, such a beautiful and deftly filmed Cinderella Ball for Adults.  I don't know a woman that loves this film who does not say \\"I want that dress!\\".<br />Sarah is an easy to relate to teen.  She is part child - part woman, one foot in each world and truly not belonging to either.  Added to this, her father has remarried and has little time to spend on his growing daughter.  We are not told, but it's clear her mother is dead.  Mom was an actress and lover of the magic and she passed this on to her lovely daughter.  It's very hard to believe Jennifer Connelly is only 12 years old here!!!  She is the perfect Sarah, the beautiful woman-child that has no sense of her place in the world.  Too grown for childish things, too young for boys and dating.  Her cherished childhood toys are giving carelessly to her new baby stepbrother, again emphasizing her feelings of alienation.  Her new mother has little patience, and even when she tries, she meets with a hostile resentful woman-child.  Sarah pain at feeling as if she is not wanted anywhere is so heartbreaking.<br />Left with the crying baby, and feeling that her world is slowly crumbling around her (reflected in Bowie's \\"As the World Falls Down\\"), the child side takes control and spitefully wishes the baby to be taken away from the Goblins.  In true Muppet fashion, they promptly and cheerful comply.  Sarah faces the Goblin King Jareth - perfectly brought to life by Bowie - and demands he return her brother.  When Jareth says he will only return her brother if she finds her way to the Goblin City, Sarah sucks in her courage and goes after him.<br />Along the way she meets wonderful friends such as Hoggle and Sir Didymous, and finds out her own inner value and worth.  Something we all have to do in growing up.<br />A true faerytale for the little girl in us, wonderfully realized through the magic of the Muppets, Connelly and Bowie.  This set is laced with all the wonderful goodies that will thrill all the many lovers of the film.<br />Kudos for the super repackage.eets wonderful friends such as Hoggle and Sir Didymous, and finds out her own inner value and worth.

B000002HPV|5.0|First came Debut, then Post, now this, Homogenic. It is considered 'Icelandic Techno', but it is so much more than that. And believe me, Icelandic Techno is very, very good!<br />Homogenic's mix of techno, lulling beats and rhythmic strength add to the surprise of the album. All songs are very unique, with slices of different technological effects. Bjork's raw and luscious vocals compliment all songs extremely well.    <BR>`Hunter' is a superb opener, with its uses of intimidating lyrics and an eerie tune that leaves you thinking you were lost in the woods with an alien chasing after you. <BR>`Joga' is an explosion of different styles. Strings add depth, with the `volcanic' effects erupting in your ears and leaves you wanting more. <BR>The plain, simple beats allow Bjork to show the authenticity of her voice. Her style is true to the album and is much more intimate than `Debut' and `Post'. Letting the tracks flow continuously really makes you realise how diverse the album really is. Tracks such as `All Is Full Of Love' and `Alarm Call' really shows us Bjork's emotion and how she articulates the song to suit her own singing style.<br />What's really great about this album is that there is no set theme; therefore, it can be played at any time, and to suit your own mood. The tracks have so much power and oomph that it really doesn't matter where you play it, the pleasure lies in the music. <br />One track that I particularly took a liking to was `Pluto'. The song is very powerful and Bjork's voice is so dominant, that you will have her voice drumming in your ears into next week. It's use of distortion on her voice and electronic beats really take over your mind, an exceptional track.       <br />The album may be short, but the variety is all there. The album will defiantly be here in years to come. Bjork has worked wonders with this album, fabulous!
1577311760|1.0|Wow, what a disappointment.  I can't believe how bad this book is.  Even though I enjoy &quot;New Age&quot; thinking, this book made my eyes roll back into my head. It felt pretentious bordering on the absurd.  Don't waste your money.
0804106304|4.0|I watchted this movie about 5 years ago, and I finally got around to reading the book. And I think this is the first time I can honestly say that to me the movie was as good as the book! (shocking, I know)<br />This book is about 4 mothers and 4 daughters and their stories of love and loss. There's such a difference in the stories of the mothers &amp; of their daughters, being that the mothers grew up in China &amp; the daughters in the US. It's about their learning to appreciate and understand each other and their lives. What's nice is that in the beginning of the book there's a list of each character and of their stories. It makes it much easier when you go from story to story to remember who's who.<br />What I liked most about the stories was how these women took all of their circumstances and made the best they could out of their lives. Such an inspiration, when you think about how being born in China in the early 1900's was a very difficult time for women. How being born in a different country could make all the difference.
B00005JLPK|4.0|I've been going back and forth on how I wanted to rate Frida, because although it was in general a very good film there were a number of things that just felt wrong and interrupted the flow of the film.  That may sound like it's nitpicking, but when you are relying on strong characters and corresponding strong acting to carry a film, I would think that you would want to reduce the level of &quot;cheap tricks&quot; so that the audience can totally get behind the characters.  Julie Taymor is a very talented director but she's gone a little overboard here.  Dealing with the art world per se, it was interesting how she managed to weave the original artwork of Frida Kahlo into the film, but there were times when I looked at some of my fellow viewers and we both had the same expression - &quot;What the heck was that?&quot;<br />However, this film is not really about Julie Taymor but about two overwhelming personalities, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and the actors who portray them, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina.  I don't say these kinds of things lightly, but how neither one of them ended up with an Academy Award is beyond me (but at least Salma was nominated).  In truth, the film should have been titled &quot;Frida and Diego&quot; because although there has been a great movement lately to recognize Frida for her own accomplishments, the truth is that her life and Rivera's were intertwined even more than the movie indicates.  Indeed, some of the best scenes in the film center more on Rivera than on Frida, particularly the famous (or infamous) Rockefeller Center incident.<br />As to the aforementioned lack of some continuity, I am not sure if it is a failure of the writing or the editing, but there were scenes that seemed to completely contradict previous ones, and it was only in going back and looking at some of them again that I noticed subtle foreshadowing that would have helped the later scenes make more sense.  I am all for not clubbing an audience over the head withsymbols and messages, but it can be taken too far in the other direction.<br />Taking all of that into account, I give the film 4 stars because it was clearly a labor of love for Salma Hayek and that counts for a lot.
0553573411|5.0|I don't read as much as some, but more than most. I have a backlog of books I want to read... the 'pile beside my bedside'. So, rereading books comes at the expense of reading a new book. I will reread this series sooner than later. The series was an excellent read, and the ending was both worth the read and a fitting conclusion to the adventure.
0440211727|3.0|Overall this is an incredible book as the first one from any author, but I like other books from Grisham better.  The book becomes very slow after the first 100 pages, and the ending is rushed a bit. IMHO, if would be better if 20 more pages could be spent on ending, but 100 pages cut in the middle.
0688156819|5.0|I love this book, and Tim Burton. He is a brilliant director and this book shows his skills as an author also. This book is comedic and depressing all at the same time. He takes stories that are very sad and tragic and makes them seem funny. It's a great book, with great poetry that will make you sad and amused all at once, it will make you laugh, cry, smile, frown, but mostly make you want to read it again and again. Well, 'till next time. Later.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Hear me out before you think I'm just a Britney-basher.  In case you're completely tone-deaf, I think everyone has to notice that her voice is absolutely horrendous!  Yes, some songs on this CD have decent beats, decent lyrics and rhythms, and would have sounded fantastic had they been sung by anyone else who can actually hold a note.  <br />The bottom line is that Britney couldn't carry a tune in a bucket if her life depended on it, and while some may think that the songs themselves are what matters, that even though her voice may not be the best \\"instrument\\" she still is capable of pulling off a singing career, this is the MUSIC business, where people should actually possess singing talent.  Anybody who thinks her entire career isn't solely based on showing her bare body almost every time she's in public, and resorting to cheap publicity stunts in order to keep her name in the news is blind.  Answer me this:  if she really had talent, as many who have written reviews proclaim, why is it that every headline, magazine cover, etc. about her has absolutely nothing to do with her \\"music\\"???  I wish America and the world would wake up and realize that she is simply the product of a very smart team of marketers who prey on the public's obsession with sex...does anyone honestly believe that if an anonymous girl with the same vocal prowess as Britney sent in a demo to a record label, that she would actually BE SIGNED?!<br />Quick rundown of the CD:  some beats are interesting (\\"Toxic\\") and would have been great songs with a capable voice, the collabos suck (Ying Yang Twins???), and on most songs, except for her \\"ballads\\", the lyrics are literally indistinguishable because of the insane amount of electronic alteration done by studio engineers in a lame attempt to mask her complete lack of talent.  Pop quiz to all you who actually like this garbage:  what in the world is she even saying in half of her songs?? (no fair looking at a lyrics sheet!)  Oh, and for those who proclaim that she is \\"like, sooo talented!\\" seriously need to have your ears checked...there's a very good reason why she almost never \\"sings\\" live, and I don't just mean performances where she's doing so much choreography that all she'd be doing is panting into her microphone...it's because she literally is incapable of performing a decent song that lets her voice stand above any accompanying music or synthesizers.<br />Want quality music?  Don't buy this.  I highly anticipate the demise of this person who is nothing more than a stripper with a record contract.
B000088E6M|5.0|This is one of the best records 50 has done. Buyin this cd is not a waste of money at all. 50 knows how to do what he's good at fo'real. All of 50's cds are the best, but this is one of the better ones!
B000002LK1|5.0|While not a far departure from it's predacessor, Violator was a breath of fresh air for late 80's depeche mode fans. The songwriting is somewhat poetic and contains plenty of love obsessed, yet pop-rock friendly songwriting. Singer David Gahan and lyricist Martin Gore guide you on this dark exploration (almost as if you are walking on the moon, completely isolated with them) as the music flows non-indulgently through the entire album. <br />Disregarding the idea that this is mostly synth-pop, depeche mode can keep some driving beats when necessary. With Violator, there is a sudden and abrupt feel of caution since a sense of romanticized sin has already infected the listener. <br />There are some standouts, such as the phone sex of the funky \\"Personal Jesus\\" <br />The love / hate aspects of the jazzy \\"Policy of Truth\\" sound cool as the overshadowed guitar approaches more audibly by the end of the song. <br />\\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" is probably my favorite on the album which builds into beats that give it a driving effort till the silence breaks.  <br />\\"World in my Eyes\\" is a great opener that you can use your imagination with.

But don't worry, ROTK is #2 and will not move from there for any movie! This movie is so good! I loved every minute of it! There wasn't a bad part in the movie! I didn't get bored or tird at all! If Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson don't get Golden Globes or Oscars for their roles, I will be very upset because both of them deserve it, they are amazing in this movie! Check this one out as soon as it comes to DVD or if it is still playing in your town, don't miss it, it is worth every penny!
B00008CQS0|5.0|If you enjoyed the music then you must see the film.  The premise for \\"Goodbye Lenin!\\" is simple.  A woman has a heart attack weeks before the Berlin Wall crumbles.  She lapses into a coma for eight months and her family is advised that to ensure her recovery she must not experience any shocks.  Her son interprets this to mean that she should not be told about the political changes in Germany.  A true believer in the East German model should never learn that her world had collapsed.<br />In addition to the core plot there are also a number of sub-plots.  There is the human tragedy of families separated by politics; a love story and the ructions that occur within a growing family of three generations.  Each is dealt with sympathetically.<br />As time passes, the ability of the son and family to continue with an elaborate hoax becomes harder and harder.  To simply find old East German supermarket products becomes nigh on impossible.  Also, the ability to even confine an invalid within one room fails as her minders let down their guard one day and she walks off to see the new capitalist world she never knew existed.<br />The film's climax comes with how the family eventually explains the changes to the mother.  This is both deft and amusing.<br />I recommend \\"Goodbye Lenin!\\" to all thoughtful film goers.  It addresses an issue that could never be handled by Hollywood.  It is not a film of action but one that deserves a wider audience.
B000002KJM|3.0|After ZZ Top had been formed from 2/3 of the American Blues and 1/4 (but the leading 1) of the Moving Sidewalks, came their first album.<br /><br />ZZ Top are a straight-up blues-rock band. They are really good but sometimes they lack variety. Here, they begin with 'Somebody else been shakin your tree', an excellent blues-rock numbers with country guitar and harmony vocals. The other highlights would be the plaintive bluesgrass-rock of 'Old Man', 'Goin down to Mexico' the driving 'Backdoor love affair' and the oddball 'Squank', which benefits from a bit of wah-pedal, I think.<br /><br />Some of the songs are dragged down by uncharismatic vocals from Billy Gibbons, such as on 'Neighbor Neighbor' and 'Just got back from babys' - actually he sang way better on the Moving Sidewalks album. 'Certified Blues' is a standard, by-the-books, blues-rock shuffle. So is 'Bedroom thang' but at least that has charm.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good listen, but not consistently inspiring. 3/5
6300275213|4.0|This is an oooold movie, as you'll realize when you see how very very young Tom Hanks is in it. He was an unknown with not much more than a TV sitcom to his credit when also unknown Ron Howard tapped him for the roll in Splash with Daryl Hannah.<BR>It could have been just a piece of trash - a mermaid who comes to Manhattan looking for the guy she saved from drowning - twice - and fell in love with. She doesn't even know her own name and takes Madison as her moniker as she happened to be standing on the corner of Madison Ave when he asked her.<BR>But in the hands of Howard and with Hanks and Hannah doing their damdest, it turned into a really sweet and funny movie that became a surprise hit and made a name for the directors and actors.<BR>Worth watching, even now.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|Errol Morris's stunning documentary is about one of the 20th century's most significant players: Robert McNamara, who reprises the highlights of his life and professional career. The movie covers a lot of ground, including McNamara's stint as a Ford Motor Co. executive, his participation as a war planner in World War II, and his crucial involvement as secretary of defense under President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and under Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War. There are some stunning revelations, including his role in the firebombing of Japan, as well as the nuclear face-off between the United States and Cuba. This is another brilliant coup for Morris, the inspired documentarian who has made a career out of conversations with the most fascinating subjects. He tells a story that knocks you right off your feet.
0393057658|5.0|As a fantasy baseball devotee and a regular reader of Rob Neyer's columns on espn.com, I was excited to see how a non-specialist, Lewis, would react to the quirks of the baseball world.  Lewis's reaction is the defining baseball book of this generation.  Lewis masterfully weaves together A's GM Billy Beane's personal story and conversion to statistical analysis with theory and reasoning behind that analysis.  Lewis also does a superlative job describing the other side: the baseball old timers who distain number-crunching and instead look for intangibles when scouting ballplayers.  Why look into how well the hitter controls the strike zone if you can simply see if he has &quot;the Good Face&quot;.  Imagine an accountant eschewing numbers to see if a company just looked right, just felt right in her gut; well, that's how baseball did, and mostly still does, operate.<br />Not some esoteric tome, but a terrifically engrossing and informative book.  I think even my mom would like it.
B000059H9E|4.0|The twisty plot, taken from a Ruth Rendell story, is handled adroitly, lightly, and concerns young Victor (Javier Bardem), imprisoned for the accidental shooting of a policeman: when released, he finds the girl he loves married to the now paraplegic cop. Almodovar has toned down the frenetic heat of his early comedies: this is an almost restrained, intimate picture of passion, jealousy and revenge, the vivid characters dignified by real emotion and motivation; and all this allied to the old Pedro's vibrant visual style.
0385504209|4.0|Brown's best seller, perhaps ironically, wound up under the Christmas tree for me this year.  The buzz about the book is because of the way Dan deftly weaves enough historical facts into the plot to give the reader a sense that it MIGHT be true.<br />As literature, it is a popular page-turner with rather shallow characters.  Robert Langdon never really became life-like or very interesting.  Sophie Neveu was a good female lead -- brainy, brave and determined -- fitting for this subject matter.  I think my favorite characters were the villains.  I like Silas the albino monk who kept inflicting pain to keep him aware of Christ's suffering, while ignoring the commandment &quot;Thou shall not kill&quot; and offing all the people who he felt were on God's hit list.  I also really like Remy the butler who was kind of like a French R2D2 with enough human twists to keep him interesting.  It was a shame he was allergic to peanuts; because I would have liked to have him kept around to the end of the story.  Lee Teabring (if I correctly recall the character's name) as the millionaire on crutches was endearing to me at first; so I wasn't quite prepared for the twists at the end.  I found the suspicions Brown created on whether Bezu Fache the police chief was part of the plot or not to be a bit manipulative; the character could have been given a bit more depth.  While I did want to keep turning the pages, I found it a bit tiring how almost each chapter wound up the tension like a cliffhanger.  There are only so many cliffs one can hang over before it becomes routine.<br />As far as the reality of the book, many Christian theologians understand that the Bible was edited.  The role of women in the Bible was more shaped by Paul's attitudes than by those of Jesus Christ.  In The Urantia Book's version of the Life &amp; Teachings of Jesus, there was an entire Women's Corps of 62 female evangelists whose existence was edited out of scripture, and whose most important teacher was Mary Magdalene.  So while it is probably no surprise that the church is male dominated, nor is it equally surprising that God loves his daughters as much as his sons, Brown has brought all of these together with the Opus Dei and Priory of Sion to make us take pause and wonder.  Truth never suffers from honest inspection; so this is probably the greatest service from The Da Vinci Code.  Enjoy!ry Magdalene.

0553103547|5.0|A GAME OF THRONES is the opening volume in George R.R. Martin's massive  A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE saga. This is epic fantasy at its very best. Dark, realistic, detailed, gritty and not for the faint of heart. Martin offers real depth instead of pseudo-depth invoked by lousy exposition and info-dumping. Believable characters who have to make hard choices and a setting that is brillantly evoked, this series is a masterpiece that will join the ranks of LORD OF THE RINGS, EARTHSEA and MEMORY, SORROW AND THORN.

Impossible, Singing My Song, and maybe a few other are good.

0140288503|4.0|I read the book after watching the movie and it's amazing how much the movie missed. While the movie is very pro-American, anti-Somalian, Bowden's book is not as biased. Bowden gives an account of the incident and also tries to insert the Somalian point of view, something the movie does not attempt to do. Aobut the only downside to the book is the numerous characters introduced. It seems almost impossible to keep all the characters straight without having a photographic memory or writing down a summary of each character.

B00009TB5G|5.0|I received \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" as a gift, but once I found out there was an extended version, I had to go out and get it.  I also got the extended version of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".  The extended version is definitely the best choice.  The extra footage explains some things that were not covered in the original film like the age of Aragorn which will shock you, the reason why Boromir tried to steal the ring from Frodo in the Fellowship and why Faramir is taking up his brother's cause.  This version just presents more depth overall story wise and character wise.<br />The general story continues as Frodo and Sam are separated from the rest of the Fellowship. They continue their journey to Mordor in the hopes of destroying the ring with the guidance of Gollum a former Hobbit. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli continue their search of Pippin and Merry who were taken by the Orcs. To the surprise of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli Gandalf returns to help them in the preparation of a battle with the people of Rohan against the Orcs at Helms Deep a fortress in the mountains. The battle scene is one of the best ever made. The special effects in creating Gollum are unsurpassed.<br />I think it was great that an extended version was offered.  It would have been difficult to sit through a three and a half hours plus movie in the theatre.  This way you can get it all at home at your own convenience.  In addition, for those interested in film making discs 3 and 4 show you virtually step by step how the movie was made including background music, scales (differentiating the characters various sizes-man/elf v. dwarf v. hobbit), scenery, graphic art, models, special effects, etc.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm not even a big LP fan, i only just got their older cd Hybrid Theory and it was awesome! I was so excited to get this cd and it is the best cd i have ever listened to! The beat on all of the songs is amazing. I love the extremely fast beat in &quot;Faint&quot; The songs in this cd varies alot, there can be fast songs that make you want to get up and there are songs that have alot of meaning. Such as Numb, which is an excellent song and is my 2nd favorite other than Faint. I believe the best songs on this cd are Somewhere i belong, Easier to Run, Faint, Breaking the Habit, Nobodys Listening (which sounds very cool with the japanese flute added) and Numb! Even if you are sceptikal, or unsure if this is a good cd, GET IT! You Will be suprised!
B00005JMCN|4.0|Seabiscuit was the great son of Man of War and if you know anything about horse racing, Man of War was one if not thee best horse to ever race.  Although Seabiscuit did not reflect his sire's physical attributes and demeanor, Seabiscuit no doubt reflected his speed and desire to compete.  This true story is not only a wonderful account of Seabiscuit's triumphs, but incorporates the story of his owner, his trainer and his jockey all of whom needed each other in more ways than just on the track.  <br />C.S. Howard (Beau Bridges) was a self-made businessman who went from working in an automobile factory to running his own automotive franchise.  Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was a horse whisperer/trainer who understood the heart and soul of a horse.  Johnny \\"Red\\" Pollard (Tobey McGuire) had the natural ability to ride although a head taller than the average jockey.  These three men have a destiny that will cross paths and lead them to personal as well as professional success.<br />The story incorporates the history of the great depression era which affected Red Pollard as a mere teenager separating him from his family as well as the impact the automobile had on society which offered C.S. Howard the opportunity to gain wealth in the West.    <br />Seabiscuit was a colt that was overlooked from the very start.  Due to his smaller size (slight of 15 hands) and laid back mannerisms, Seabiscuit was used primarily as a racing companion for other horses when he is spotted by Tom Smith.  Smith convinces Howard to purchase the horse for the then low rate of $2,000.  From there Seabiscuit becomes the horse to beat.  His biggest challenges will lie with a duel with War Admiral (a Triple Crown winner) and with a comeback after a serious injury.<br />This is one of those heart-warming the-underdog-always-triumphs stories.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I am a 73 year old handicapped man.  Shania had me jumping with rhythm and joy.  Joy to view a crowd in Grants Park, Chicago made up of all ages, from children five or six to adults.  Mostly clean cut kids with the amazing ability to know most of the words to Shania's melodies.  I also noted, none of the band had tatoos that were visible and were multi talented on several musical instruments.  I was jumping with the rhythm and talent of Shania and her entourage.  I am glad to view a program or concert of quality and good taste.  It bolstered my faith in the younger generations.  Merrill Richards of Snowflake, Arizona
B000002WPI|5.0|their is not one below par track on this entire album.  each member of the wu hits you hard with their hardcore style and rymes.  this album is definately RZA's best work.  you can put this album next to illmatic and ready to die as far as standards go.  a must buy!
B000089A07|5.0|Let's get the Red Dragon vs. Manhunter thing out of the way; seeing how almost every reviewer wants to compare them.<br />Thomas Harris refused to let the makers of Manhunter use his title with good reason: &quot; Manhunter &quot; was an absolute butchry of the novel! i thought that LONG before Silence of the Lambs was ever released!  The acting, the music, the Miami Vice look to the characters { obviously Micheal Mann was transfering his television imagery to film at the time )was just terrible. and I'm sorry---Brian Cox is a good actor; but he NEVER at anytime struck me as the kind of creepy socipath who could literly crawl around in your skull! And the guy who played Dolyerhyde was as wooden and bland as they come.<br />ANYWAY---Red Dragon, on the other hand, is far more faithful to the novel, although it does extend Lecter's part for Anthony Hopkins, but that is more than a welcome change! Edward Norton, despit his youth, is far more believeable as Wil Graham, the tortured &quot; iddecker &quot; profiler who is called out of retirement by Crawford, portrayed by Harvey Kietal, who is far better in the role than Scott Glenn was. And in Norton, we finally have an intellectual advasary capable of matching wits with Lecter, seeing how his character IS the one who caught him {  always thought Foster was miscast as Starling, as great a movie as it was....Juliane Moore made the charcter a STRONG female lead in &quot; Hannibal &quot; [ don't get me wrong I love Silence too] }. Ralph Fiennes is an evil nighmare personified as Francis Dolyerhyde; but unlike the awful actor in &quot; Manhunter &quot;, he is able to make a monsterous character sympathetic, and this movie gives us more insight into Dolyerhyde's past and what made him INTO a monster. <br />Emily Watson is expectional as Dolyerhyde's only redeeming quality Reba; Anthony Heald is back and in fine form as Dr. Chilton, who will NEVER get the better of Lecter { and will eventually end up on Lecter's menu by the endof Silence! }; and Anthony Hopkins, of course, is top notch as evil incarnate Hannibal Lector, who even as he appears to help Graham track the Dragon, plots the FBI's agent's demise from the confines of his cell. And Danny Elfman's score is nothing short of magnificant.<br />Skip Manhunter...it's up there with Halloween III as being one of the worst movies of all time; except HIII has the redeeming quality of being horridly funny in moments. RED DRAGON is the way Thomas Harris wanted his novel to be done on screen; he's said so himself.<br />Kaenan
0812548094|3.0|While Goodkind blew all other books of this genre out of the water with Wizard's First Rule, the second book in the series was not as stellar. It provides a certain satisfaction to readers who were left hanging after the first novel, and ups the stakes for Richard Rahl by threatening him with more minions of the ruler of the Underworld. This book is another page turner and well written, but a little disappointing after reading the first in the series. Let's put it this way: it doesn't leave you dying to read the third book.
B0000025DD|4.0|David Gilmour's self-titled first solo album was, without a doubt, the best one he did.  While not always the most innovative member of the Floyd in terms of composing (lyrics and music), he does do a quality job here of making a rock album.  Like any work written solely by Mr. Gilmour, this album relies on traditional chord structures and styles.  The lyrics are also pretty ordinary, not always even seeming personal to him (guy wants girl, guy can't have girl), although occasionally with some interesting wordplay.  If you enjoyed songs like &quot;The Gold, it's in the...&quot; and particularly &quot;Childhood's End&quot; from Obscured by Clouds, you should do well with this album.<br />Perhaps DG's musical best is &quot;Raise My Rent&quot;, which, interestingly enough, seems to be the inspiration for &quot;What Do You Want From Me?&quot; on The Division Bell (my second favorite instrumential being &quot;It's Deafinitely&quot;).  After that, I'd name &quot;Short and Sweet&quot;, which departs a bit from a more standard rock format, giving it an easily memorable sound all to itself.  That's the trouble with this album--that certain songs are too &quot;standard', and while they're well made, and showcase Mr. Gilmour's guitar and vocal talents well, they don't really stick in the mind.  &quot;Mihalis&quot; , for instance, while still very nice, is not as effective as Rick Wright's instrumental &quot;Waves&quot; in evoking the feel of the sea--one might guess the latter's subject matter without the title (Mr. Wright musically creates the sound of waves slapping into a boat's hull), whereas the subject of &quot;Mihalis&quot; requires explanation to get the intended images.  Mihalis, incidentally, was the name of Mr. Gilmour's boat.<br />Here are two of the other noteworthy moments to watch for.  Mr. Gilmour shows off his capabilities on multiple instruments on &quot;Cry from the Street&quot;--he does a nice job with the Hammond organ that would not seem out of place on aPink Floyd album. Perhaps Rick Wright gave him lessons?  If so, he seems to have paid attention.  Also, the singing in &quot;So Far Away&quot; is some of the best I've ever heard from him anywhere, and perhaps the most difficult.  The rapid note changes are quite impressive--not the sliding, warbling sound so common in today's second-rate radio garbage, but clear, crisp notes each individually sounded in rapid succession.<br />Overall, this rates as Mr. Gilmour's strongest album.  Guitar enthusiasts will be happy to know that his playing excels throughout and his unique style is unmistakeable.  The only drawback is, unlike Pink Floyd and Rick Wright's albums, other instruments aren't generally ever invited to the forefront.  Even trumpet legend Miles Davis would yield the floor to other instruments, making his accomplishments no less remarkable.  Something similar might have helped here.  This, and other flaws, are why I can't award the full five stars.  However, this album has *earned* its four through very good work, and I think most Floyd fans should definitely consider buying a copy.
0385504209|5.0|This was one of the best books, and best mysteries, I've had the pleasure of reading. I was glued to it from start to finish. It's a must read for all open-minded people.
B000002IPZ|3.0|Testament might be the band that technically deserved a place on top of thrash-metal scene, but never received it in the 80s. This record exactly shows why that never happened.<br />No matter what others say about musicianship, vocal skills, etc., there's only so-so of interesting music here. Generally, it's a rehash of their previous record, &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot;, with almost zero new ideas. Even the highlight, the song &quot;The Legacy&quot; is a repeat of &quot;Ballad&quot; from the mentioned predecessor. The music sounds strained, lacks inspiration and ideas. Songwriting fails to excite. Technical skills of the band-members means nothing, if they can't write a handful of decent and interesting songs. After you listen to this record, it immediately falls into obscurity, and you'll need to press yourself to put it on again.<br />Testament's 80s career started at it's peak with 87's &quot;The Legacy&quot;, and only went downhill from there till mid-90s. Either buy that 1st album, or go for more death-ish 90s Testament. This album isn't worth your money and time.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is it folks, this is what every Zeppelin fan has been waiting for.  This 2-DVD set is just too darn good.  It's amazing to see so many different performances after being stuck with one performance (The Song Remains The Same) for a while.  I really can't play favorites among the two discs because they're both just plain awesome.  The first disc is comprised entirely of one concert from The Royal Albert Hall in 1970.  This is raw Zeppelin, no colored lights, no fancy costumes, no video screens, no flaming gongs (I don't have anything against those things though).  It's just four guys rocking out.  From the frantic opening drums of \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" to the closing blues lines of \\"Bring It On Home\\", this concert displays Led Zeppelin at full force (and they were only together for less than two years at the time of this concert).  My only complaint is that \\"How Many More Times\\" runs a little too long, but I'll watch it anyway.  Now, I've heard complaints about the picture quality and the sound quality and how they both are not very good at times, but you have to remember, those reels were 33 years old when Page decided to create this DVD set, of course they're gonna have quality problems, but I really don't mind.  The bonus features are also interesting.  There are 3 TV appearances and one promo film for \\"Communication Breakdown.\\"  The best TV appearance footage has got to be the French TV video just for its humor value.  Humor value?  Yes, seeing Led Zeppelin rock out in front of an audience of stowic middle-aged people drove me to laughing.  The others are pretty good too, I especially like the Danish TV one.<br />Alright, so the Led Zeppelin of the first disc was raw and fresh, but the LZ on disc two is polished and refined, but that's a good thing.  The disc starts out with \\"Immigrant Song\\" which is okay, not a great track, but serves as a bridge between disc 1 and 2.  Then, the real magic starts to happen.  First up is footage from the 1973 Madison Sqaure Garden Concert that was not inlcuded in \\"The Song Remains The Same\\".  \\"Black Dog\\" is pretty good, but not as good as the next three songs.  \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" is amazing and full of energy, but then comes the excellent blues song \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" which features Jimmy Page playing incredible guitar.  To close out is \\"The Ocean\\" which features John Bonham and his opening count in, which the crowd obviously loves.  The film quality is also better than the one from Royal Albert Hall.  Then, we transition to video for the Earl's Court footage.  It starts with usual three songs from the acoustic sets that LZ did after the release of III.  But, the real gems are the three electric songs, \\"In My Time Of Dying\\", \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" (my personal favorite), and a version of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" that beats out the one from TSRTS.  From there we go to Knebworth in 1979 and back to film.  The Led Zeppelin here stands in stark contrast to the raw LZ that graced disc 1.  LZ performs most of the hits from their later two albums along with \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Sick Again\\", but the real treat is the rendition of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" which forgoes the middle section for an funky extended solo by Jimmy Page, a much different version from that at Royal Albert Hall.<br />Overall, this is a must have for any Zeppelin fan, along with How The West Was Won.
0780622553|4.0|I have always found this movie to be somewhat fascinating. It came out in 1998. Long before Neo ever found out he was &quot;The One&quot;. When this film came out, director Alex Proyas was hot on the heels of his first film, The Crow. It was a gigantic hit. Every advertisement for Dark City had &quot;from the director of The Crow&quot; in it. Obviously the suits at New Line wanted people to go see this because they liked The Crow. Well folks, this film is not even in the same ballpark as The Crow. It invented it's own ballpark.<br />Writing a review for a film like this is quite difficult. To praise the movie and tell why I liked it, might give away some key plot points and ruin some twists for you. I will never do that in any review. I will say that after seeing this again, years after 'The Matrix' came out, I can't believe Alex Proyas didn't call the Wochowski brothers and demand some royalties. Basically this film has a simplified Matrix plot with a lot less action and more characterization. <br />John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bathtub and can't remember anything. He can't even remember his name. As he is leaving the hotel he is staying at, the desk clerk tells him he left his wallet at a local diner. He goes to pick it up, finds out he has some sort of telekinetic powers and runs into a few creepy, pale looking guys. They try to capture him, but he escapes. He then finds out he has a wife (Jennifer Connelly, my DREAM woman) and is wanted for murdering some prostitutes. A psychiatrist (Kiefer Sutherland) is trying to find him along with a police detective (William Hurt). The city that these people live in, is a very dark city. There is never any sunlight. You rarely see any water, and only indoors. And people can't remember much from their past. You, as a viewer, go along with John Murdoch on his journey do uncover his past, the secrets of the city, and who are these beings that are running the town.<br />That last paragraph really doesn't do the plotjustice. It's much more complex and interesting than it sounds. Like I said before, if I told you why then I would give away a lot of the movie. After seeing this film again, I can now look back on it and know it was ahead of it's time. There was a ton of hype surrounding the release of this flick back in '98. Big expectations were placed upon the film due to Proyas' first film, 'The Crow'. And like most movies that are ahead of their time, it didn't do that well. Most people, like myself at the time, didn't really understand it. Now, in 2004, after seeing 'The Matrix' films, you will see MANY similarities and will probably enjoy the picture quite a bit. Just remember, that 'Dark City' came out first. As you are watching this, don't knock it because it seems like a Matrix rip-off. It's actually the other way around.<br />If you like interesting Sci-Fi films in the vein of Blade Runner, you will dig this movie. Since most of the planet has seen The Matrix by now, it might be a kick for some people to look back to 1998 and see where the &quot;great&quot; Wochowski brothers ripped their idea off from. You can probably find this at your local Target for around $10. It's well worth it.<br />Being a older DVD, you won't find many useful special features here. It's got a couple commentaries. One is from Roger Ebert, which I found quite interesting. You rarely hear a film critic do a commentary. There a cast &amp; crew bios, filmographies, and a trailer. There is also a comparison piece where it compares the similarities to this film and Metropolis. Not great supplements but for $10, you can't go wrong.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|For those &quot;hardcore&quot; Badu fans, this album has the potential to be disappointing but that's not because it isn't good, it's misunderstood.  First of all, the title, (Worldwide underground) is perfect because...Badu takes her style which combines socially conscious lyrics with universal messages and mixes them with universally appealing music.  Erykah tried to go beyond her label as a neo-soul artist and truly tried to go worldwide with her &quot;underground&quot; style (accredited to her by her fans).  Many might think she &quot;sold out&quot; or left her roots but Badu is expanding pre-conceived notions of what &quot;underground&quot; is and attempts to make it something universally accepted.  This album has great songs period.  The melodies and beats are still soulful but Erykah also shows us that music isn't only about deep poetic messages, it's about making people feel- whether it makes you feel good or just makes you feel like dancing!  The remix to &quot;love of my life&quot; is crazy displaying the talents of some of the most respected women in hip hop.  For those expecting a totally thought provoking album, this isn't it.  Although this album contains songs that are socially conscious and insightful, it also just has tracks that make you wanna dance, make you wanna bob your head and feel good.  The talent is still crazy and breaks Badu from her shell and displays her lyrical, musical, and performance skillz.  Don't get it twisted, this album is still da bomb, just not deserving of 5 stars and is not a classic.  Definitely a good buy.
B000002TRM|4.0|The only reason I wouldn't give this cd 5 stars is sound quality.  The EMI people have made this cd nearly obsolete because they spread all of its tracks across the reissues.  For the die hard Chili Peppers fan a must have.
B00009V7RF|5.0|The Black eyed peas have been talented and unique since their first album but never reached their full potential....untill now!  This album is str8 DOPE.  The energy is crazy.  This album is just funky.  The lyrical talent is off the hook and the beats are ridiculous.  Fergie, the new addition to the group, is just what they needed to push them to the next level.  This group is one of the best live performers in music and this album gives the listener the same type of hyped up feeling becuase their energy shines through in this funky ass album!  If you're tired of albums that only have a couple of good tracks, then buy this one.....every track is good but many are bad ass.  If you like this album, then I recommend K-OS Exit.  Definite must have classic hip hop album!
B00005A46T|4.0|This is a good cd. It has 2 or 3 crappy songs, but most of them are enjoyable. For all those who say Nu-metal is a crap genre and that they hate it. Don't listen to it. Pretty easy solution, isn't it? I myself am a fan of alot of nu-metal bands such as system of a down, korn, and others. i also like other types of music like coldplay, yes, and The Who. its just a genre. some people like it and others don't. live with it
B00005JM20|4.0|This movie is your normal spy spoof. I wasnt a fan of Bean: The Movie and this movie is also not that funny. Stick to the silent Rowan Atkinson.

B000089RVR|4.0|This album has definitely received mixed reviews! <br />I was very impressived by her first album even if it did have one or two poor tracks (but most albums do).  I had no hesitation in buying the second album, and after one or two listens, it started to take shape.<br />Many reviewers say that Dido's voice is boring.  I agree that it can be a bit tedious at times, but the songs on this album are so beautiful and well crafted that this minor complaint can be overlooked.<br />The album features many highlights including:<BR>- This Land is Mine<BR>- See the Sun<BR>- Take Me Home<br />And while some tracks do sound like songs from the first album, it shouldn't deter you from exploring the real gems on here.<br />A nice comfortable album.  Glad to own it.
0385504209|3.0|What a great premise and outstanding first half.  Midway through this one, however, Mr. Brown simply seemed to give up.  It's unfortunate because he really stumbled on a cool concept.  If at any point you're reading this one and you find yourself dozing off, you should probably put it down.... it just continues to go into a tail spin from there.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This, is not good horror. If you want good horror, check out The Exorcist, In the Mouth of Madness, Event Horizon, Jacob's Ladder, Ringu, or maybe even Man Bites Dog. This is NOT a revisitation of any kind of vintage horror..... it's a company taking a shot in the dark.  This one seems to want to borrow the &quot;rural legend&quot; theme from Pumpkinhead. The end product is nowhere near as well put together. Flavor of the week horror flicks CAN be good, suspension of disbelief included..... it's just that this one doesn't even seem to make an effort to convince (I mean c'mon, the only reason the curious guy gets his eyes eaten is because he thinks one of those &quot;dead bodies&quot; the demon is dropping down the pipe might be alive, for some stupid reason) the viewer at all. Mind you, the idea of a creature that regenerates itself by consuming the parts of its victims would be rather scary if implemented in say, a sci-fi horror movie, in this it just doesn't work. Add the fact that this movie got an even higher budget sequel is proof that God hates us all. If you want a good chill, go rent any of the movies mentioned above. If you've rented or bought this, and have received some sense of being entertained from it, you should be shot / stabbed, probably both. Bottom line is, DIE. People like you waste the money of good folks that wanna see worthwhile movies.
0767819659|5.0|The movie uses many different elements from many different Madeline books.  It is cute and represents Madeline accurately.
B000001FS3|5.0|Plenty of others have reviewed the music on the album, so I will not contribute another love it/hate it review. However, I believe that this album represents the band's shift from political activists that rock to rockers that give a damn (most of the time).<br />Certainly the band has gotten more polished over the years, but I prefer the more raw, poignant sound of their previous albums to the experimental works Zooropa and Pop. I know these albums were made as a commentary about our culture, but the band became wrapped up in the pop culture that they sought to deride. All That You Can't Leave Behind was a nice recovery, however, and Achtung Baby is an excellent CD, even if doesn't match the standard set by its immediate predecessor, Joshua Tree.<br />The Joshua Tree stands as the one CD where U2 attained their highest level of perfection. The only misstep, in my opinion, is Bullet the Blue Sky. Despite my appreciation for their activist streak, I have to say that I have a difficult time enjyoying Bullet the Blue Sky musically. I know that good music is rarely easy to digest at first listen, but after many exposures to the song, I still cannnot bring myself to enjoy the disjointed sounds and rhythms of this song. I never tire of listening to the rest of the album, so it is small sacrifice to listen to this song, too.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  It has classic characters that the newer one doesn't have: Heckey and Verbina.  Although I love the new movie as well, it still doesn't replace this fun classic.
0060005688|3.0|I salute Barry Schwartz for tackling a subject which is at the heart of so much of the current malaise of modern American consumer culture. However, I find it interesting how Schwartz underscores the whole 'overabundance-of-choice dilemma' by deluging the reader with an exhaustive taxology of somewhat self-evident examples and a litany of academic studies. A healthy dose of humor and more informal slice of rich anectodes might have illuminated the subject, but instead Schwartz laboriously overstates his 'too-much-choice-is-bad' thesis ad infinitum--the irony is that her 'over-chose' his material.
6304698690|4.0|I agree with Steve about the part in the garden where the children are chanting.  That shouldn't have been in there.  That part is very strange.  I love the actor who played the dad.  He was absolutely perfect for that part.  He looked like a brooding, wounded man.  If you fast-forward through the chanting part, the movie is then perfect.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera a.k.a X-Tina is 2003's breakthrough artist. A singer previously categorised with Britney Spears has emerged through the abyss of pre-fabricated teeny pop, to becoming one of Contempoary Pop/R&B's essential soul divas. <br />The birth of \\"Stripped\\" has reborn Christina Aguilera as an artist; forget all you knew and let this album introduce. From the dramatic intro to \\"Stripped\\" part two, you can see it's all Christina, and it's all real; an entertaining window into her life, heart and soul. <br />There are no dull moments on the album, and there are not repeats on the album. Every song has its own unique lyrics and array of musical techniques. <br />There is the Hip-Hop/R&B influence on tracks like: \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" - a strong female anthem to the unjust of sexual equity in the 21st Century. The lyrics are so honest and blatant, it makes you question \\"how far have we really come in terms of equality of gender?\\". \\"Dirrty\\" - the debut single, which doesn't really do just for the album's lead. It seems a bit to fabricated, yet \\"Dirrty\\"s music (not video clip) really caught my ear. An excellent pop song with interesting and intelligent Rap by Redman. And not forgetting \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" with its theme of casual sex, I think this song is utterly inappropriate and absolutely appropriate! It contradicts Christina's Christian upbringing and her forever war against the \\"S.L.U.T\\" image, but it's a part of a 20-something-year-old's lifestyle. <br />There is also a jazz/blues/soul music influence to parts of the album, which is something Christina never conveyed honestly on her debut. \\"Walk Away\\" a very emotional and piognant ballad, it's about her relationship with badboy Fred Durst. This song is one of the most emotionally-charged songs I ever heard. I feel all her emotions, and it reminds me of other songs like: Mariah Carey's \\"Petals\\", Stacie Orrico's \\"Strong Enough\\" and India.Arie's \\"Ready 4 Love\\". <br />\\"Impossible\\" the bluesy ballad, written, produced and arranged by fellow R&B diva Alicia Keys: proving she is our generation's Carole King. X-Tina's vocals are so strong here reminicing of the '60s Etta James' \\"At Last\\"/Aretha Franklin era. \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" incorporates Mariah Carey-esque vocal gymnastics, and is a deep and emotional lovesong: glad to see this lil' diva find happiness after heartache. <br />And there is the pop: \\"Fighter\\" a turntable view of \\"Walk Away\\". This track has an awesome empowering vibe which always makes me wanna punch the mirror and break some glass. \\"Beautiful\\" by Linda Perry, with its acoustic tone and positive self-love message will always remain a classic. There is also \\"Soar\\" - though produced by teen-pop veterans on her debut, it is honestly one of the most inspirational and positive songs I ever heard. It fits right in with the \\"Stripped\\" message. <br />Christina also displays other genres on the album. From a latino/Spanish guitar-esque \\"Infatuation\\" plus its interlude to heavy Courtney Love rock of \\"Make Over\\". Both are album highlights. <br />This album is easily the best album of the year. It SHOULD be 2004 Grammy's Album of the Year. There is honest lyrics and music here which shows its worthiness. I can see that Christina wasn't thinking about singles here, but more of a cohesive record with songs all single-worthy. This album is an absolute classic which will be turning in my CD-player for years to come. Somehow I feel that it'll be hard to top this, but I have stronger feelings that tell me, if anyone is going to - Christina Aguilera will. I am now a proud X-Tina fan, I anticipate for her next record. And if you're looking for a more Personal-Christina check out \\"I'm OK\\".
6305291489|5.0|This movie is good, just like the older version is.  I love both versions.  It's probably one of the few remakes where I actually like both versions.  I love Martin in this version.  He is so funny, although he should never wear a speado again.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|If you are in the mood for a nimble caper film, with great locations, inventive heists, some spiffy chase scenes and loaded with a terrific cast, pick this one up.<BR>Really. Grab a tub of popcorn and enjoy.<BR>F. Gary Gray makes good-looking, smart movies. And they always seem to be better than you originally gave them credit for. I'll tell you I personally won't be making that mistake again.<BR>The cast is perfect eye candy. They look great delivering tasty lines. Donald Sutherland adds his gravitas. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron will keep appropriate hormones percolating briskly. Seth Green offers his brand of geek cred, and I mean that in the best way. Mos Def continues to surprise...he's really good here.  Jason Statham makes the most of his part, using every bit of his developing iconic presence. His look goes a long way.<BR>Edward Norton adds another intelligent characterization to his resume. It's a one-dimensional role (hell, they all are but who really cares here...) but the details and quirks make all the difference in the world.<BR>All in all, a surprisingly enjoyable film!
B00009ATIX|1.0|This is definitely the worst movie I saw last year -- it may be the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.  The music was annoying, the lighting dark, the acting almost non-existent and the story ridiculous.  Even a die hard George Clooney find would find little to like in this amazingly bad movie.  (I took a friend last year, and his distaste was sufficiently strong that he still won't let me choose any new movies.)
0156907399|3.0|Virginia Woolf writes using a stream of consciousness, which provides for an interesting read as she explores the psychological effects of same events on different characters and permits the reader to study the characters in the novel to a greater extent. She doesn't speak from the first-person point of view of each character, but uses the third-person instead, so that all characters, no matter what age, have similar intellectual capacity as it appears.  You'll need to devote a great deal of attention to the novel; it is hardly a light book, and you would probably only enjoy it to the full extent if you like this type of writing. Personally, Woolf's style is not one that I prefer, and I had a hard time getting into the novel. I also think that I would enjoy it far better the second time around: I often re-read books and find many things that I had failed to notice the first time. If you've never read any of her works previously, it is a pretty good novel to begin with to determine whether this style is to your liking.
B000066NW0|1.0|What more need I say, this is utter garbage. Avril is in it just for the money, and attention. The marketing industries think that is she dresses &quot;punk&quot; than these teeny boppers will think that it really is. Yes, this was directed at all of you Avril loving teenage girls that think Avril and Good Charlotte and hard-core as you like to call it. Punk used to be about rebellion and anarchy, not love relationships. You posers should learn what REAL hard-core music is, like hard-core METAL and PUNK. Stuff like The Misfits is REAL punk, but that might make your virgin ears bleed. And my favorite metal band, CRADLE OF FILTH!!!!!! Go listen to them you darn teeny boppers and tell me what you think, you have my sympathy and regards however.<br />I know that review by Stacey was a long time ago, but if you are reading this Stacey,I just wanted to inform you that your review made me vomit.
0440180295|4.0|The story centers around Billy Pilgrim, who becomes dislodged in time and travels back and forth between past, present and future. Somewhere between the fire bombings of Dresden in World War II, his capture and imprisonment in a zoo on the planet Tralfamadore by aliens, and his surprising success back on earth in the later years of his life, Vonnegut paints an absurdly, disquietingly hilarious portrait of life, death and much in between. <br />While subtlety is the key to Vonnegut's writing for the story, his explosive understatements do more to blow you away than any more technical language could achieve, so don't be fooled. I often found myself caught off guard and laughing on the bus as I read, or smirking wryly in mid conversation when remembering certain parts of the text. For a quick read with simple language, you'll be amazed at just how much is said in so little. <br />It's a slight mismatch that Slaughterhouse 5 has often been compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, as I feel that the two texts have little in common except their absolutely absurd intelligence and the fragmented scene sequences. For lack of a better choice the two can be compared, though I find it to be misleading at best. Both share the resulting impression of a life shattered in the futility of war and convey their messages with an absurd (there's that word again) humour, but I feel that Slaughterhouse 5 widens its scope to include the societal perceptions of \\"life\\" in its jeers whereas Catch 22 simply addresses the paradox of war (and with a much, much finer microscope at that). <br />There's a great deal more that could be said about Slaugherhouse 5, and even more still that I'd like to say, but I feel that (like most good novels) it's a book that must be read instead of simply told about, and I don't want to give anything more away to someone that hasn't read it yet. This is your cue now to go out and grab a copy, so go. Check out www dot yourwords dot ca for more.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a book about a writer (Jonah) who wants to write a story on the day the atomic bombings during World War II.  He requests information from the family of the man who invented the bomb, but soon finds out that there is more to this man than meets the eye.  He finds out that man developed a chemical that can wipe out the entire world as we know it. On top of that, Jonah discovers a very mysterious religion that unfolds as the story progresses.<br />This book is an excellent read with many un-expected twists and turns.  The more you read, the more the book develops and the more in depth it becomes. It is a mind bender that makes you take a second look at many of today's religions, and the beliefs that go along with them.
B00008OWZC|5.0|After 25 years of hearing The Sound Remains the Same CD, this is a refreshing live album which has more songs and way better sound quality. Here is how the CD stacks up<br />Pros:<BR>-A chance to hear Led Zeppelin live for the many younger fans who became fans after John Bonham died.<BR>-Waayyy better sound quality than TSRTS (The Song Remains the Same).<BR>-Great selection of songs performed brilliantly and does not suffer from the overdubbing of crowd cheers.<BR>-\\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" sound great and could be considered even better than the studio versions.<br />Cons:<BR>-Both concerts were performed in 1972 so there are no songs from Physical Graffiti, Presence, or In Through the Out Door.<BR>-Has \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" as 25 minute long medleys which could be considered a pro for some, but there is no way to hear the two songs performed normally.<BR>-Lacks the songs \\"Good Times, Bad Times,\\" \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,\\" and \\"Ramble On.\\"<br />Overall a must have for Zep fans young and old, even if you already own TSRTS.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I think if you are a big Rammstein fan like me you will love this DVD.  I think everything about this DVD is good notihng on it is bad.  And i also think that Paul Landers is pretty dedicated to the bad if he will do the concert sick with a high temperture.  That is why in &quot;Du Hast&quot; you see him run off and he does it in a few more.  But beside that I think it is every good. That is why i gave 5 stars.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Presence is regarded as Led Zeppelin's weakest album of all new material (the weakest overall goes to Coda). There are several filler songs on here, but there are two songs that live up to Zeppelin's standards. The first is &quot;Achilles Last Stand,&quot; Led Zeppelin's greatest epic-style song (Stairway and &quot;Kashmir&quot; are long, but not considered epics). It is over ten minutes long! It is dominated by Bonham's pounding drum work, but has some nice riffs by Page. This is a song where all of Led Zeppelin showcase their talents. &quot;Nobody's Fault but Mine&quot; is probably the best song on the album and has a hard rock/bluesy sound to it and is probably in their top 20 greatest songs. &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; is the worst song on the disc. It is not rock and for some reason was released as the single even though it was the worst on the album. A filler song at best, hearing it makes me want to destroy stuff until I remember that for every three to five good Zep songs there's always one awful song that makes you grimace when you remember that the greatest band of all time recorded it. Usually found really cheap, it is still worth the price of the CD, just don't raise your expectations too high.
B0000009S3|5.0|It's been 10 years since Frank passed on, and we may have forgotten about his more outrageous nature.  United Airlines actually features an entire channel of Zappa music this month (1/04).  However, he left plenty of albums to remind us that this was a muscian who really pushed the edges.<br />Some of those pushes are pretty hard to take (e.g., &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh), but Hot Rats stands out as a signature Zappa offering.  The first song, &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot; is the single best thing he has ever done, and was a jazz-fusion classic before the genre even got started.  &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; and &quot;The Gumbo Variations&quot; are also strong.  &quot;TGV&quot; has been restored to its full 17 minutes on the CD after getting trimmed for the LP.<br />The album has fantastic musicians playing with Frank:  Lowell George, later of Little Feat, on guitar [2 members of the Feat started their careers with the Mothers of Invention]; Don 'Sugercane' Harris on fiddle; and Ian Underwood, sax and keyboard virtuoso.  But the strongest is Frank, and he proves that he is one heck of a guitar player.<br />For those of you who lament the amount of risk being taken in contemporary music today, buy this album.  There is more risk (and reward!) achieved here, than in the last decade's worth of pop.
0385507755|5.0|This book was one of the most gripping books I've read - period!  It proves that all people have problems...some more than others. It doesn't matter if James Frey is from a wealthy family or a poor family, white or black, he's an addict. Thats the story of the book...this diverse group of people all brought together under one common bond and goal. James' way of reaching and conquering that goal also happens to go against what a few million recovering addicts believe is the best way to beat it....but what do they know?! The fact is that this country is over run with drugs. Some take drugs like James Frey took them...others take them just to make their own personal day to day pain go away. The fact is we've never been winning &quot;The War&quot; on drugs.....but James Frey won an impressive battle. Read this book- it will change your opinion of what an addict is supposed to be.
038533348X|4.0|I enjoyed reading Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, it was an easy book to read. I loved how everything in the book made sense, and connected with one thing to another. Its the type of book you could read again and again and figure out something new that connects each time you read it. Cat's Cradle isn't a book you can skim and just go through the motions, you actually have to think about what you are reading and how it relates to the other things you have read. Cat's Cradle is a good book if you enjoy fiction books.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's managed to meld The Bends with Kid A--it's not OK Computer, but it's still utterly incredible.  Well done.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is the award that Chirstina should win for this cd. I loved the song and video for Dirrty. I thought that the video was one of the best I had seen all year, and it was an amazing way for Chirstina to let people know the she was back. I couldn't wait to get the album. Buying it the day that it came out,I sat in my car with the volume turned all the way up, waiting to hear what took 3 years to come out,and what came out of the speakers was the most powerful music and amazing voice that I have heard since Mariah Carey.It's nice to know that even with all this fake females with no talent in the music business that a rare gem like Chirstina is willing to share her Beauitful voice with the world. After hearing that cd, no one could ever put Britney and Chirstina in the same group,ever. From the Intro to Fighter to Get mine,Get yours,Chirstina has proven that she is a grown woman and she is playing by her own rules. My favorite song by far is Walk Away, she sings it with so much passion, and that voice is truly a gift from God. I can really relate to that song.I also feel like every female should listen to Can't Hold Us Down because that is a song that makes you want to stand up and be proud to be a women. If there is anyone out there that has ever had anything negative to say about Ms. Aguilera listen to this cd because she will shut you mouths.    I have been a fan of Chirstina's for a while, and listening to her music, and watching interviews has made me repect her as a women. Chirstina is simply a true talent with an God giving voice, and courage to speak her mind. She is true role model for women everywhere.
B000002KD9|4.0|When I first bought this album in 1970, I would've considered this a 5-star album. But after three decades, a few of the songs sound too dated, too much like museum pieces, to give it more than 4 stars. In particular, &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Til the Morning Comes&quot; and &quot;Birds&quot; have a late-60s early-70s feel to them that don't translate well in the 21st Century. And with &quot;Southern Man&quot; having been played a few trillion times on the radio over the intervening decades, I have to skip over that track whenever it comes up. Now, it might not be fair to make these statements because of the changing tastes and styles since August 1970, but if these recommendations are for people who have never heard this album, I want them to be fairly warned about these weak spots.<br />But now it's time to contradict myself. AFTER THE GOLD RUSH is still one of my most played albums. The title song, although a warning to the polluters and war mongers of the 1970s--and those apathetic towards them--still is beautifully melancholic with its simple piano backing and haunting french horn. &quot;When You Dance, I Can Really Love&quot; still kicks ass, and is still ignored by rock radio programmers for some reason. &quot;I Believe in You&quot; still stands as one of the era's most enduring love ballads. And finally, &quot;Don't Let It Bring You Down&quot; is an elegant example of a singer/songwriter's foray into the dark side of an unfeeling modern society. What keeps these and other tunes fresh is that Neil Young was very successful at avoiding the pitfalls of cliches and repetition that most singer/songwriters have fallen into (and continue to do so) over the years. Also, Neil Young has always had a pulse on what the country was feeling (interesting when you consider he's Canadian), while flavoring it with his own unique, personal touch.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I usually reserve my trips to the Big Screen for movies of Sci-fi, fantasy, animation or gratuitous violence.  The Matrix, Lord of the Ring, Nemo, or Terminators is the type of eye candy that I normally would want to feed upon.  However, The Big Fish DVD will have a home upon my shelf, and many spins within my player.  <br />I'm glad that I am a fan of Tim Burton and was drawn out of my circle of comfort.  Absolutely NOTHING that Tim Burton directs could be considered ordinary.  Big Fish is no exception.  Well, I guess it is ordinary in the sense that it seems to be quite ordinary for Tim Burton to always reach a new level of excellence.  <br />Big Fish is an extraordinary look at an ordinary event that all of us have to deal with in some way, shape or manner in our probably hum drum pathetic lives.  Big Fish is an exquisite meal of voluminous substance that will give you much to chew on for some time.  All that is served to you, the characters, settings, visualizations, music, the stories within the story have been prepared as if from the finest chefs and set down in front of you with the beauty of a fine tapestry.<br />I'm not an Oscar aficionado, but I believe that LoTR and Peter Jackson have not received the notoriety that is deserved from the weenie's that hand out the little gold man.  I've had hopes that he would do well with this last installment of LoTR.  Jackson's  accomplishments were truly spectacular.  However... should Big Fish swim away with some ring making material that might have gone to LoTR, I won't be disappointed.  Neither will you!
B000002KDG|5.0|When most rock music was mired in bands with no faces, with no known musician's names, and extremely little talent, like Kansas, Styx, Journey, Neil Young heard the wake-up call coming from the punk world. And although his own &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; (1975) was a howling, screaming, raw, powerful tour de force, perhaps he even recognized a need for a rock and roll shot in the arm for his own music. The result was &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot;.<br />In a weird way, this album sounds like a greatest hits sort of collection, with one side displaying his accoustic talents, and the other his gritty electric prowess. Of the accoustic tracks, &quot;Pochahontas&quot; (sp?) is the most unique because of its strange combination of haunting despair for the plight of Native Americans which turns into a love song for Pochahontas and all things Americana (the Astrodome, Hollywood, Marlon Brando, etc.). It's the most inventive song on this side, although all the accoustic tunes are engaging and mellow without being sleep-inducing like most 1970s accoustic work.<br />The second side has one of Neil Young's best electric ballads he's ever written, &quot;Powderfinger&quot;. By saying it's his best electric ballad, I realize that this includes a body of work which features &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Down by the River&quot;, &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;, etc. But really, in terms of lyrics and musical brashness, nothing beats this song.<br />Finally, the album is framed by the songs &quot;My, My, Hey, Hey&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, My, My&quot;. These book-ends, one accoustic and one electric, are by far the most revealing insights into the rock industry ever written. Better than Floyd's &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; or &quot;Have a Cigar, these two songs signal the end of one era of rock and roll--&quot;The King is gone but he's not forgotten&quot; and the heralding of a new age &quot;Rock and Roll can never die&quot;. With rock and roll in Neil Young's hands, we canbe assured of that.
B000002H2H|5.0|im a big metallica fan... up until the black album!! Black album was ok, maby 4/5 but old Metallica is the only metallica and Ride The Lighnting proves my point. for whom the bell tolls and ride the lightning are my favorite songs from metallica except for master oof puppets and sanitarium. ride the lightning must be my favorite cd and ranks #1 on my chart.<br />fight fire with fire  5/5<BR>ride the lightning 25/5<BR>for whom the bell tolls 50/5( my favorite)<BR>fade to black 4.5/5 (kind of slow at first)<BR>Trapped under the ice 5/5<BR>Escape 4.5/5 (not as fast as the others)<BR>Creeping death 6/5 ( interesting lyrics)<BR>Call of the ktulu 4/5(not a fan of instrumentals but still great)
B00005V0X5|5.0|This is a remastered version of Megadeth's first album. i dont have the remastered one i have to orignal but my boyfriend does. all the songs sound good except these boots (or whatever its called) it bleeps out a lot of stuff because the person who wrote the original song i think threatened to sue dave mustaine.. blah blah.. but anyways yeah its good i have heard it before. in the booklet it gives commentary about each song what it means what gave dave the idea to write it so on. i would get this but if you know someone that has the orignal cd then you might want to borrow it if you want to hear the unbleeped version of \\"these boots\\" or just buy the orignal one instead of this.
B00003CXBK|3.0|The first half of this movie was amazing! I'm sitting on my couch thinking this might become a new favorite on my video shelf to sit next to The Last Unicorn, but the last 20 minutes or so blew it!<br />Yes, I see they were trying to make it out a win win situation where both the side of the forest and animals and the side of the humans  get what they want and are happy, but that is unrealistic and impossible.<br />It was horribly anticlimactic and left me with an empty feeling for what could have been if the story had not decided  cop out  and try to please everyone.<br />Most people give this movie 5 stars so I suppose no one else noticed the awful ending?
B00005V331|5.0|once again venom kicks ass! this i belive is there first album. Well cronos has such a great voice and they can play really good. im not very good at writting so i cant say much except that venom is very raw and can play fast at times. i would defintly get.
B00003CXXO|1.0|The first half of this movie was really great, but after that it turns into a senseless Disney film. It's horribly obvious where Kubrick left off and<br />Schpielberg comes in.<br />Then, there are those robot things that looked exactly like the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind!<br />This film was one of the most dissapointing I've ever seen in my life!<br />It could have been great, the premise was there, but it was ruined beyond redemption.  I'd give this no stars if I could.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD was by far the best Christina has ever made.  The way she expressed herself through her music was awesome!  I really recommend this CD for everyone! It can really get you through tough times, in the way the songs are.  GREAT CD!! I LOVED IT!
B000002V0Q|5.0|Metallica was my first Heavy Metal influence when I was 17, and from there I went straight to Iron Maiden. The only work of Megadeth I had then was a few MP3 downloads (from which, 'Holy Wars' and 'Tornado of Souls' became two of my favorite singles). Thinking about it now, I wished I had picked up a Megadeth CD during that transition instead since the Metallica - Megadeth parallels are quite strong and liking one almost guarantes that you'll like the other. <br />Recently I bought Countdown to Extinction and I was very surprised. You see, the fascinating aspect of this album is that ALL THE TRACKS are VERY VERY GOOD. All of 'em. Every single one. All the tracks. They are all great. <BR>Unfortunately, you can quite obviously tell they are shortened for radio play, but that doesn't take away from their quality and level of musicianship.  <br />Highlights are &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; &quot;Psychotron&quot; &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; and &quot;This Was My Life&quot;. <br />As you can see, this is a pretty gnarly release and I very much recommend it.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Okay, sometimes greatest hits collections can be just promo albums for new singles etc but this album surpasses all of that. This album releases us to the full spectrum of hits by this 70's super group. The songs represent a full spectrum from the first album up until the last (The Hunter). The music itself is great and it's also a great companion CD to the DVD of the same name. So, whether you are an old fan or a new one this CD should be in your CD collection.
B00005K3NY|2.0|Along the trajectory of David Cronenberg's career, Scanners feels like a step backwards. While the premise is intriguing - drug companies and evil corporations wage bloody war with telepaths as cannon fodder - the execution is painfully dull and unintentionally funny. Part of the problem is the acting, which is wooden all around but reaches new depths whenever Stephen Lack opens his mouth. This guy is dreadful. He sure does Lack the ability to deliver lines. The high point of the film comes early with the infamous exploding head scene. Nothing that follows, not even the climactic psychic battle royale, comes close to the visceral potency of that scene. It's all downhill from there. For instance, how does a telephone booth explode? And if you were shot in the hand with a huge dart, wouldn't you just pull it out rather than run around a mall until it knocked you out? If there were a few more exploding heads I might not be splitting hairs. A disappointing outing from a talented filmmaker.

B000088E6D|3.0|For those who is truly a veteran music fan of Classical/Swing like Steven Langley Guy can skip this CD.<br />For those who don't really listen to Jazz/Classical but enjoy a little popular tunes by Diana Krall, Josh Groban etc will play this to sleep.<br />For those who first invest in this kind of music Michael Bubl&eacute; is a good start so you'd continue to discover more experienced performers (some of them appeared behind the credit of the songs on this CD).<br />Bubl&eacute; is not only a pretty face but he does have a good Karaoke voice, and I like to see new names in my CD racks so I purchased this debut album. My favourite track is PUT YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER, call me crazy but I think it sounds better than Paul Anka. Sorry, executive producer.<br />And MOONDANCE of course, a brand new uplifting listening to a Van Morrison's remake.<br />Nevertheless this is a commercially successful album, boasting a smart selection of songs with creditable producer lists.
0780626966|5.0|In 1984, the first \\"Nightmare\\" was born.  After that, six sequels were made.  Now, they are all in one box set that is a must own.  I totally love it!  There are so many great things about these movies.  The dream sequences, the characters, and especially Freddy Krueger make them all enjoyable in their own way.  These movies are especially interesting because they don't consist of the same kind of usual killer.  Sure, there is Michael, Leatherface, and Jason, but who cares?  There are all the same.  Freddy is totally different.  He instead kills people in their dreams, which make for an intriguing storyline.  I never exactly admired Freddy Krueger.  I'll admit I was into Michael and Jason, but Freddy has more style.<br />The first one comes off just right.  The whole plot made sense and made it scary to know that are dreams could be reality.  The later installments do not live up to the first, but some are very good and are directed by Renny Harlin (one of my favorite directors!), Rachel Talalay, and, of course, Wes Craven.  Everyone of these deserves a watch.<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) - The best one out of them all.  This one is where it all began and so did Johnny Depp's career.  Heather Langenkamp is great as Nancy.  Robert Englund was outstanding (and would be for the next 6 installments) as Fred Krueger, the dream stalker.  This has a good, creepy mood to it.  (10/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, language, and partial nudity.  \\"I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy!\\"<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 (1985) - This one was a bit weird.  First off, it forgot the idea of Freddy (Englund) being in your dreams and made him become a real person in life.  He begins to take over Jessie's (Mark Patton) body and starts killing people again.  Second, it didn't explain its characters that well.  It wasn't that scary, but it was entertaining.  Mark Patton wasn't that great.  He mostly just screamed like a girl the whole movie and wore dorky clothing.  (6/10)  RatedR for strong violence/gore, brief nudity, and some language.  \\"You've got the body, I've got the brain!\\"<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 (1987) - Forgot about the last movie and went on to a different plot.  There are teens at a psychiatric ward that are suffering from bad dreams about Fred Krueger (Englund, who is very creepy in this one).  Anyway, the kids start to die one by one.  They find out that they have special powers in their dreams and that they can maybe defeat Freddy for good.  The movie was good, but I didn't need to see that one kid turn into a wizard (a bit corny!).  There are some really cool scenes in this one.  (7/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, nudity, sexual situations, and language.  \\"Your big break in T.V.!\\"  <br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 (1988) - This is one of my personal favorites.  This one had everything from cool dream sequences to great characters, to vivid colors, and many more.  Too bad that they killed off the remaining Dream Warriors.  I felt really bad when Joey Crusel died off.  Anyway, the new characters are just as great, especially Lisa Wilcox as Alice.  Danny Hassel is also great as Dan.  This is one that you need to see.  (8/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, nudity, and language.  \\"How's this for a wet dream?!\\"<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 (1989) - My least favorite one.  It turned away from the colorful Part 4 and turned into a gothic and disgusting movie.  Lisa Wilcox returns and so does Danny Hassel.  He dies into the movie fairly quickly though.  Then were left with one-dimensional characters.  It was a pretty stupid plot and movie.  Alice (Wilcox) has an unborn child and it is killing her friends by letting Freddy get into its mind.  Don't bother!  (4/10)  Rated R for graphic sequences of violence, gore, and some language.  \\"Put the pedal to the medal, Dan!\\"<br />Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) - This also one of my favorites.  It is not a great movie, but it is very entertaining.  There is a great soundtrack also.  Freddy (Englund) is more goofy in this one.  It's pretty funny though.  The dream sequences are pretty nifty and there isn't a lot of gore (which is good).  A young Breckin Meyer plays a stoner, Spencer, and he's pretty funny.  The plot is about 4 teenagers and their psychiatric helper that go to Springwood, where all the children have died from Freddy.  Freddy begins to kill them off, but there is a link between Freddy and one of the 5 people.  This also sets up some back round on who Freddy is.  This movie is just for a good time.  You can also watch the ending in 3-D if you have the box set.  This is a movie you have to see.  (7/10)  Rated R for violence/light gore, language, drug use, and human abuse.  \\"Hey Spence, let's trip out!\\"<br />Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) - Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Nick Corri, Wes Craven, and others play themselves in this movie.  There is another \\"Nightmare\\" sequel coming into production.  Heather (herself) is going to play Nancy.  Yet, as the movie we are watching progresses, the script is being made the way we watch it.  So, in the end, everything in the movie was made into the script.  Soon, people start dying on the set and Heather's son (Miko Hughes) begins to act like Freddy.  Heather decides to take on the role of Nancy once more and take Freddy down for good.  Okay, this movie is really confusing.  I never knew if I was watching a movie, a dream, or a movie inside a movie.  Freddy is rarely seen, which is a good thing.  His make-up isn't that good in this one.  It looks like melted rubber and it doesn't go well.  I also thought this was the one where Freddy became scary again.  I really didn't think so.  It came off as a bit of a disappointment in the end.  (6/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, and language.  \\"Come here, my piggy.  I got some gingerbread for you!\\"<br />The Nightmare Encyclopedia - This is a great disc for all the information about the Nightmare On Elm Street series.There are three things to choose from on the menu: PRIMETIME, INDEX, and LABYRINTH.  \\"Primetime\\" is an introduction to the disc and Wes Craven talks about how the first \\"Nightmare\\" was made by using his own childhood memories.  The \\"Index\\" contains all seven movies and you can go into the making of the movies and how things were done.  \\"Labyrinth\\" is a tricky little thing, but fun.  You go through maze-like hallways, going into rooms, searching through cabinets for deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, alternate endings, documentaries, and much more.  This eighth disc is really helpful and a lot of fun.  It is a nice addition to the collection.  (10/10)<br />All together, this makes a great set that is definitely worth owning.  The transfers are great, the special features are great, and the movies are fun.<br />Welcome To Elm Street!
B000003S5H|3.0|In \\"Moon Safari\\", the duo Air offers an intriguing and hypnotic soundscape that is a delight to listen altough, as a whole, never turns into a must-have record. Their trip-hop/ jazzy/ laid-back tunes are good to listen to and relax on the couch, creating an interesting and lazy mood. The singles \\"Sexy Boy\\", \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" sound great, but the three last songs of the album are a bit weak and too long, so the disc ends up being uneven. Despite this, the duo is still better than other french acts like Cassius or Daft Punk, who rely more on style than substance. \\"Moon Safari\\" is a nice, etheral trip and a pleasant experience, one good addition to the diverse dance genre.
B000001FTQ|5.0|The other reviews are right: a little light for the price, but Bad alone is worth it, and the other three songs are tasty also.  I especially like Three Sunrises, a cheery number that sounds like a tribute to the Mamas and the Papas &lt;g&gt;.<br />One thing no one's noted, though: Bad ends with a rarity, an actual solo by Adam! and very nice it is, too.
B000000W6X|2.0|This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and &quot;Karmakoma&quot; is a great moment as well, but after the third track, &quot;Three&quot;, it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of &quot;Light my fire&quot;, is particularly weak and just puts me away. <BR>A disappointig and souless album, &quot;Protection&quot; is alright as background music, but not much else.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I really give this album 3.5 stars (3 in a half stars) because like any other cd, it has it's ups &amp; downs, but most of the songs are okay, or pretty good, while there is only two 'excellent' songs on the album,but, hey! It's still buyable. It's just the songs aren't 'down right good.' You'll still like it, though.<br />Me against the music-Evrybody knows &amp; loves this song, although, when I first heard it, I was like...''What the F**k? This song SUCKXXXS!!!!!'' But now, I like the song. I usually listen to this song in the middle, since I do greatest to least. 4/5<br />I got that (Boom Boom)- While others hate this song, I 'kind of' like this song, but the Ying Yang Twins holler to much, &amp; You don't get to hear Britney that much, because Ying Yang Twins are hollering! But still, I like the song. I like the beat, &amp; the lyrics, therefor it get's a pretty good score. 3.5/5<br />Showdown- I enjoy this song, mostly because of the lyrics, which is...''wow.'' I couldn't believe she was actually saying ''You're looking good when you're half dressed.'' I was shocked by that, but they said that ''In the Zone'' was going to be full of surprises.4/5<br />Breathe on me- What can I say about this song? I don't like that much, probably beacause it sounds like that Kylie Minouge (or however you spell her last name, I don't know) music. I mean, I like some of her (Kylie) music, but not so much that I would go out &amp; buy her album. So, anyway, if you like Kylie's music, you'll like this.3/5<br />Early mourin'- I LOVE THIS SONG! THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM! Moby was  a genius when he wrote this, because it's great! What I don't get is why everyone hates this song. The beats cool, &amp; the lyrics are awesome! ''I was shaking my ass in the streets this mourin', just walked in &amp; it's early mourin.' Bump, bump till the break of dawn, &amp; it don't stop till the early mourin.''' Love that part! And let me tell you something funny, I thought this would be theworst song on the album, but it was the best!... She should make a video to this song.6/5<br />Toxic-The song is pretty good, but the video is better. It's really cool (the video). I like the beat of the song, &amp; the lyrics are okay. There really isn't much more to say about this song, except it's better than 'M.A.T.M'. 4/5   <br />Outragous-The song that I thought was gonna blow me away, because it was produced by R.Kelly, who made 'ignition.' But, it turns out that your thoughts can be wrong, &amp; so it says...the song sucks! Sucks! I wonder what happened while he was writing this. Something must have went wrong! 2/5<br />Touch of my hand-...We all know what this song is about, &amp; that's nasty! But other than the concept, the song is pretty good. I like the lyrics, &amp; the beat, which sounds like your in some asian kung fu movie, especially when it begins. It gets a good score.4/5<br />The hook up- My second fav. song!!! I love this song, 'cause, well, because I like! I have hundreds of favorite parts in this Jamaican-type song. The lyrics, beat, &amp; her voice are good in this song. She sounds really good when she's singing in the ''Jamaican-type'' voice.5/5 <br />Showdow- It Suckxxxxxxxxxxxs! I hate this song! 1/5<br />Brave new girl- Good song, pretty much. She sounds like a computer when she raps, but it's pretty good! I like the lyrics &amp; the beat.It's single-material.4/5<br />Everytime-I don't listen to this song very much, but it's okay. But I think someone who can sing better than her would have made this song a little bit more intersting. But, it's good...slow song.3/5<br />M.A.T.M. (remix)- I love the remix! It's better than the orginal, but that's why people make remixes. For it to be better than the orginal!4.5/5  <br />Good job, making the cd!
6305909326|1.0|Not much to say about this one. The movie never seems to know what it wants to be, so I was always expecting something mildly interesting to happen. Well, Johnny Depp goes after a book, then after another, and yet another one...Not scary and not very suspenseful either, the acting was a bit weak (except for Depp), the characters flat (including Depp) and the whole movie was just slow and forgettable. Not really awful, just nothing special at all. <BR>A waste of time.
0385504209|1.0|This book is a work of fiction contradicted by scholarly writing and historical authorities readily avilable. Yet, there is a real danger that readers will take it as historical fact swallowing whole the sensationalist writing, anti-Catholic bent, and conspiracy plots. Based on a perusal of the reviews here, many readers do take the writing as fact!! On the one hand, it's laughable that Americans rely on novels and Hollywood movies for an understanding of history. On the other, it is very sad and consequently, Mr. Brown should be embarrassed to propagate so much falseness and bigotry.<br />Most concerning, it mocks all that is revered by Christianity by cloaking inaccurate information as fact. Moreover, it defames and slanders real organizations such as Opus Dei and the Catholic Church by assigning them roles as participants in modern-day criminal and deviant acts. Apparently, it is permissible to write a Catholic-bashing book. In sharp constrast, look at the media frenzy that has arisen surrounding Mel Gibson's The Passion for even daring to depict Jews in a bad light. Would a publisher ever dream of printing such a book about Muslims or Jews?! No. But Catholicism is fair game.<br />The novel itself is poorly written consisting of shallow character devlopment and poorly crafted suspense; it relies on silly riddles and cliff-hangers at the end of ridiculously short chapters to ensure the reader will continue reading (in a book that numbers roughly 450 pages, there are 105 chapters). Overall, I am disappointed that Mr. Brown is making a fortune off unwitting readers.
B00008S7ZW|3.0|Jennifer Aniston leaves her role in the Tv-show &quot;Friends&quot; for a while to enter the world of independent cinema with &quot;A Good Girl&quot;. The result doesn`t disappoint and the story of a late-twenties woman trying to get a (better) life is enjoyable enough. The movie is a &quot;dramedy&quot;, at times touching and real but also with an offbeat and witty feel to it. Its a film about fate, conformism, change and the results of our choices. Aniston`s character faces a defining moment in her life, though she doesn`t quite know what to do and when, making some decisions that end up affecting not only her but those who are around. She`s trying to get away from her boring, tedious and predictable life in a small town, but she never has the guts to do it, being a victim of her own choices. <BR>&quot;The Good Girl&quot; is a poignant movie, a sarcastic romantic comedy with a twist and a fine work from director Miguel Arteta, a new indie talent worth looking for.
0375432302|1.0|After reading Brown's gripping novel, Angels &amp; Demons, I expected The Da Vinci Code to be an exciting page turner. Unfortunately, I didn't expect that the novel would have essentially the same plot as its predecessor, making it completely predictable. The books even begin the same way: man gets murdered, Langdon is called in, and some beautiful woman turns up who is related to the victim, attracted to Langdon, and wants to help him solve the crime. Please, does he think he's the next James Bond? True, Brown weaves in many interesting tidbits of information, but that didn't make reading this book worth my time. Out of the two, I'd say Angels and Demons was the better read.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|the strokes are one of the best new bands out there. surviving on word of mouth for a couple years, they are finally getting the attention and the recognition that they finally deserve. this album is my pick for the best of the year. this cd contains no filler songs, no leftovers. every song on this album is awesome.
0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is really a very well written book.  It has been passed through my family and we have all enjoyed the story.  It is a fast-paced thriller whose short chapters are a quick read, lending itself very well to the pace of the plot.  It puts itself easily at the top of other Catholic Church &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, both in book and movie.  (I always liked John Carpenter's movie, The Prince of Darkness.)<br />This central theme is that the Catholic Church has something to hide.  This theme has created some really interesting books and some of which have become best sellers based on the current climate of the priesthood.  This book is well-timed to capitalize.<br />Though this book is a fictional thriller, it makes a fascinating claim at the beginning. Before a single word is written of the plot, the author declares that aside from the story, all facts are true! In reading this book, one is easily captivated by the claims and mesmerized at how these facts are unfolded and presented.  The presentation of facts is half the thriller!  However, after quite a dose of these 'facts' mixed in with the plot, the reader starts to get the sense that the plot itself is secondary.  Most everyone I know who has read the book has begun to question some of the fundamental prevailing paradigms.  I must say that I am most disappointed with the book is its lack of a substantial bibliography (nay, the lack of ANY bibliography) to back up these 'facts'.  (I read &quot;The Sign and The Seal&quot; and was highly impressed with research of G. Hancock in backing up his statements.) The only referenced books are part of the story with the earliest dating only 30 years prior.  (I must say I was expecting books from the 300-500 AD based on the book's claims, certainly not contemporaries or cronies!)  Also I believe it will be apparent to others as well that also share a limited view of Christian history (but took at least one History of Civ class) even timelines are inaccurate.  One item of note, that I caught easily, was Constantine's famous Edict in which he decides to end christian persecutions and basically making the Roman Empire a religious tolerant 'state'-- but never declared christianity the 'official religion of the empire' as claimed in the book.  Since I am not up on my christian history, it was also easy to find online a copy what happened at the Council of Nicea.  The book states that christians at this Council voted on if Jesus was God or not, and that they voted by a very narrow margin that they would think that he is.  This is FAR from the truth!  What they actually voted on (visit a non-Catholic site for an impartial view) is if they thought he was a MAN! AND the vote was not even close,  218-2!  These are two very simple examples of 5 minutes of work online that show his claims of 'authentic historical facts' are grossly inaccurate.  If the simple facts are misrepresented, what of the ones more difficult to find? I am definitely open to the potential truth, but find it hard to even entertain without documentation.  I have since checked the other books that he listed internally for reference, but they conveniently are missing bibliographies as well.  I was left wanting more information, but left feeling it was fanciful gossip on a playground.  I guess I should not complain too greatly and probably why I was duped so easily.  It is my own fault, really.  It is, after all, listed in 'Fiction'.<br />ps. ABC seemed to waste time on the subject and the info is listed here: [...]ate.

0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown's primary goal in this novel is to question Christianity as we know it, especially Catholic Christianity.<br />I come to this conclusion because from the first two words he has, by forcing uneccasarry information upon his reader, demonstrated that he is incompetent to write a suspense novel. He then, by revealing that the curator in the Prolougue is lying, proceeds to destroy the suspense of the first few chapters.<br />The book is riddled with information that is utterly irrelevant to the plot, and which does little more than to describe Leonardo Da'Vinci's heroic crusasde against the church.<br />And then we come to the flashbacks, dear Lord, put mercy in my heart.<br />Flashbacks should be usd when one is incapable of revealing his information otherwise, Flashbacks are a crutch and Mr. Brown, it seems is in a wheelchair. A fair portion of the story is explained only through flashbacks and it comes to seem that whenever Mr. Brown found a spot he decided to promptly add yet another flashback. Hurrah.<br />The theological implications of this book? Perhaps valid, but that's for you to decide. As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Whether you are a self-proclaimed Britney fanatic or just one of the millions caught in the clutches of a love that dare not speak its name, you will be in Britney heaven with \\"In the Zone,\\" the fourth number-one CD from our favorite former Mouseketeer.  What makes this album so great?  This unadulterated Britney funfest makes no attempt to take itself too seriously or provide anything more than songs full of strong beats and mindless enjoyment.  The trademark sighs and utterances are here, but if you've ever liked ANY of Britney's songs, surely you can't imagine anything less.  <br />     So how does Miss Spears compare to America's self-appointed \\"Dirrrty\\" girl, Christina A?  X-tina claims she's an \\"artist,\\" although she's apparently one that is not above an x-rated mud-splattered sex romp.  Meow!  What really makes a successful superstar?  Sha-bang!  It's personality.  So while Christina's vocal histrionics are enough to keep her barely afloat through \\"Stripped,\\" it's not enough to win her the fan base of guilty Americans who can't wait to grab that Britney-plastered Us Weekly when no one's looking.<br />     Now to the songs.  Unlike Britney's self-titled third CD, in which filler was the main course after the delectable appetizer of \\"Slave 4 U\\" (I also liked \\"Overprotected\\"--especially the remix), \\"In the Zone\\" is a filler-free free-for-all with few skip-worthy tracks.  The best: \\"Toxic,\\" \\"Showdown,\\" and \\"Breathe on Me;\\" the Madonna duet, \\"Me Against the Music,\\" is hot but you've probably heard that already.  Britney also throws a scrap to suckers like me who still love \\"Oops!. . .I Did It Again\\" with her new ditty \\"Brave New Girl,\\" poppy enough to placate even her most Oops-deprived fans.  <br />     So what's the downside?  \\"Shadow\\" is out of place and the Ying-Yang Twins should have been left in a heaping pile on the cutting room floor where they belong.<br />     (Just between me and Britney:  Brit, you've done a great job here, but in the next CD, I want to see some anger, like we saw in \\"Stronger.\\"  An enraged but still fun-loving Britney with a lot of strong guitar tracks would be a good move--\\"Now it's nothing but MYYYYY waaaaaaay!\\").<br />     So to all the Britney bashers out there?  Simmer down, Charlie Brown.  You know you love her.
0553212478|5.0|Frankenstein exceeded my expectations that were based on movies I have seen by the same title.  This book is a literary masterpiece that sets a bar for terror that is yet to be surpassed.<br />I was very impressed by the writing skill of Shelley.  She does a terrific job telling this story, using three narrators that offer different points of view and voices.<br />The monster is a character that elicited sympathy, respect, anger and hatred.  He is intelligent and articulate in a way I did not expect.  His ability to convey emotions and thoughts creates mixed emotions about him.  Yet, because his hatred and anger prevail, these emotions prevailed in me too in my regards of him.<br />Shelley shows the danger of allowing one's ambitions to overtake balance and reason.  We see the character of Dr. Frankenstein forsake all to see this dream of creating life realized.  We see the consequences of his actions that are a warning to us to tread more cautiously regarding our ambitions.<br />All of the characters are developed comprehensively.<br />I enjoyed reading this but had to set it aside at times because of the tragedy it entails.  You know where the story is headed but still hold out some hope that it will turn out more positively--like watching Titanic, you know it is going to sink but still hope maybe it won't.<br />I think this is a timeless classic you should read.
1400034779|1.0|I'm wondering what I am not seeing in this book. It came highly recommended by a friend and I picked it up recently to read on a plane. The main character is a likeable sleuth, though her opinions about men consist mostly of stereotypes so blatantly sexist that I couldn't help thinking more than once, \\"A book whose main character spoke so disparagingly of women would never get published, and certainly wouldn't get the favorable press that this book has received.\\" <br />The best part of the book is Africa, which is there, but not vividly enough to make up for other things that are missing, like a plot. The book is vignettes about Mma Ramotswe's cases. The back cover leads you to believe that \\"the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.\\" It would be a good book if that statement about a heart tugged at, danger, and a case that exists at the center of the book were true. The missing boy case takes up a total of about 10 pages of the book, 15 at the most. I kept waiting for the vignettes to be tied together, or for some clue from another case to help solve the case of the boy's disappearance. Nothing like that is part of the book. I was disappointed in the writing, the stereotypical view of males, and the lack of a mystery in the story that engaged me for more than a few pages. <br />Was it better than the in-flight magazine on Northwest? Definitely. Would I recommend it? Not if you want a good mystery, unless your options for reading material are limited. For a literary introduction to Africa, read The Poinsonwood Bible. For fluffy and unbloody yet charming mysteries with coherent plots, read Dorothy Gillman's Mrs. Pollifax books.
B000084T18|1.0|Loud and aggressive, yes;good-HECK NO!  This is an effort to cash in on wannabes and little children who wish they were living the &quot;hard&quot; life. (Ironic that the kids in the ghetto wish they were living in the suburbs, but anyway...) It all sound the same from In Da Club to P.I.M.P.-an ego stroking, look how hard I am, attempt that falls short.  Anyone can push up the bass-not everyone can write inspired lyrics. I like rap-but I give this mess two thumbs down.

B000001EL3|5.0|If anyone wants to start a Kiss collection, this is the one album that beginning listeners and the Kiss Army have in their CD players.  It has the best tracks ever put down by this supergroup.  That is saying a mouthful, because Kiss has recorded a myriad of classic material-from '73 to present day.  &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; is the rock-n-roll anthem (but is usually eclipsed by &quot;Rock-n-Roll All Nite&quot;), &quot;God of Thunder&quot; is booming Gene at his best, and &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; puts us all in the shoes of these rock-n-roll gods.  I can say yes, I do love Kiss and own every single album. I know from what I speak.  Buy this album, be happy.

0156027321|5.0|This is a deep tale, one that will inspire a lot of thought after it's done.  The &quot;twist&quot; ending is so powerful I found myself wanting to immediately re-read the entire story (with a sense of some grief) to see what clues I'd missed the first time through.  It was only after a bit of discussion with friends who'd also read the book that the meaning of the story became clear to me.  Martel may be boasting a little when he says his story will make one believe in God, but he's not that far off the mark. <br />This is ultimately a story whose perceived meaning depends a great deal on the spiritual outlook of the reader.  Without spoiling (I hope) the hook of the novel, the protagonist Pi eventually reveals two possible explanations for the events he's outlined in the story.  One is beautiful, almost magical, and requires an astounding leap of faith to believe.  The other is ugly, cynical and all too believeable from a modern standpoint.  The &quot;true&quot; tale isn't definitively identified by the author, which leaves it up to the reader to decide which really happened.  It's through this dichotomy that Martel reveals his ideas on spiritualism.  <br />&quot;So it is with God,&quot; says Pi on the last page.  And in this phrase is explained what religion means to him.  Religion gives us a beautiful view of the world, one where there is meaning and brotherhood, but one which often contains stories and themes we modern secularists find absurd and archaic, but which somewhere in our souls we desperately want to believe, even as the rational parts of our minds scream &quot;no way!&quot;  Competing with Pi's God is the world view of the agnostic, which states that any explanation other than that which happens due to the base and ugly motives we see around us every day can't possibly be true.  The story Pi tells over 95% of the narrative requires a huge amount of faith to believe.  The alternative explanation is dark and depressing, but more &quot;realistic&quot; to the rationalist in all of us.   <br />Which story really happened?  It says a great deal about the reader's view of spirituality and religion as to how he/she answers that question.  Faith can't be dissected. <br />Even if you discount the philosophical aspects of the story, it works just fine as an adventure tale.  Agnostic folks interested in survival yarns, and atheists who crave stories full of animal husbandry will still find much to love here.  <br />It's a great gimmick, one I'm sure lots of writers are kicking themselves for not thinking of.  Credit Martel for doing it with such style and fun.
B00005JMFI|5.0|Elf is an unusual movie in this day and age.  It is not manipulative and speaks of simple values and simple, true love. I went to see it with my 10-year old, a 28-year old, and a 38-year old (I am 47).  We all laughed and cried and came out of the movie amazed that such a simple movie could be so much fun and say so much. <BR>   Anytime you have a movie in which the main character is totally innocent and naive, it brings up how calloused and hardened we have all become to the things in life that matter.  That's the message of this movie.  I highly recommend it and am adding it to my Holiday DVD collection - you can bet we'll watch it every year and some inbetween!
B00005JMCW|4.0|For a movie based on a mom and daughter switching bodies, this was very entertaining for the whole family.  It was enjoyable to see the mother going to high school in her daughter's body, just as it was hilarious to watch the daughter counsel people while in her mother's body.<br />The events that occur and the script provide for many laughs.  Of course, you can't expect it all to be realistic, due to the premise, but once over that, it is funny throughout.<br />The mother and daughter both learn their lessons after walking in the other's shoes.<br />this is a good wholesome fun-filled movie that parents, teens and young children can all watch together.
0156907399|4.0|Here is a small point with a larger purpose: Virginia Woolf does not know Boeuf en Daube.  Or at any rate, Mrs. Ramsay, the heroine of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" does not, and there is no suggestion of any irony in her thought on the topic:<br /> \\"Everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready. ...  To keep it waiting was out of the question. Yet of course tonight, of all nights, out they went, and they came in late, and things had to be sent out, things had to be kept hot; the Boeuf en Daube would be entirely spoilt.\\"<br />Well, if you know anything about the kitchen, you know that this is nonsense.  Boeuf en Daube is probably the last thing that needs to be \\"served up to the precise moment ...\\"  As Elizabeth David says in her \\"French Provincial Cooking:\\" \\"there must be scores of different recipes for daubes in Provence alone...  essentially a country housewife's dish.\\"  And more to the point, per Ms. David:<br />\\"The daube is a useful dish for those who have to get a dinner party when they get home from the office.  It can be cooked for 1 ½ hours the previous evening and finished on the night itself.  Provided they have not been overcooked to start with, these beef and wine stews are all the better for a second or even third heating up.\\"<br />I wonder how many English majors from the 1950s sold their souls for a good Boeuf en Daube (did Sylvia Plath have the recipe?) - and how much better off they would have been if they'd seen through it: understood that Mrs. Ramsay did not get the point, because Ms. Woolf did not get the point. Indeed, strictly speaking, the creation is not Mrs. Ramsay's at all, but you'd have to be a sharp-eyed reader to catch on: it is the servant who does the work and delivers the finished product and she, I suspect, knows better than her mistress how flexible and compliant it may be.  There is an irony here and it is lost, I suspect, on the mistress and on the mistress' creator.<br />All of which leads to a larger point: Virginia Woolf does not know servants.  Instance in particular her observation of Mrs. McNab, the old char who comes to reopen the summer house after long disuse.  We get an elaborate set-piece description of Mrs. McNab, and it is not pretty: indeed, it is mean-spirited and dismissive in almost every way.  Mrs. McNab \\"lurches\\" and \\"leers\\"  She \\"was witless and she knew it;\\" she sings \\"like the voice of witlessness.\\" Now, if this is true, it is inexcusably rude: one may want, for some artistic purpose, to show her lurching and leering for, but here it serves no purpose, unless you count its actual function in throwing light on the author.  Anyway, the chances are it is not true.  My guess is that Mrs. McNab has operated under far more constraint in life than either Ms. Woolf or Mrs. Ramsay ever dreamed of.  Witless people do not survive under the iron whim of a Mrs. Ramsay; poor chars who do learn to survive will find that it takes all the skill one can muster.<br />I could go on, but I need to stay within Amazon's 1,000 word limit.  The point is not that \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a bad book.  It's actually quite a good book;  or at least it is a book full of good paragraphs, and Virginia Woolf seemingly cannot write a bad paragraph.  It is as bad novel, because Virginia Woolf has little of the capacity for imaginative empathy that makes a really good novelist.  They say that Shakespeare stands as a void at the center of his plays because he has poured every part of his being into his characters.  Virginia Woolf takes almost all of her characters into herself.  It is well done, but often we get to know more than we really want to know.o a larger point: Virginia Woolf does not know servants.

0743455967|5.0|On Writing is a memoir more than an instructional book on writing which is what makes it an enjoyable, as well as informative read.  Stephen King shows through stories about his life how he has become a great and successful writer.  His stories show writers what is required to polish writing skills and to become successful.  This book shows that his success came after grueling hours, sacrifice and many failures.  It shows the lifestyle of a famous and prolific writer.  He also does offer advice and instruction to writers on skills, techniques and attitudes.<br />I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this book, since it is entertaining and instructional.  I think it would appeal to writers and to any fans of Stephen King.

B00009P1O0|5.0|I never considered getting a Neil Young album until so many people were talking about him I decided to give it a go.  Some one recommended On the Beach so I went and got it.  As soon as I heard it I knew it would be one of my favorie cds.  I have only had the cd for two months, however, I listen to it regularly!  I have also recommended it to others, and those who have got it love it as well. I have since expanded on my Young album collection.  On the Beach is simply amazing!!  Get it if you don't have it!!!
B00005JMGL|5.0|Directorial vision, a quirky edginess, and a sprinkling of  magic make this movie something special. The movie made me recall, better than any movie I've seen lately, that oh-so-brief  yearning and ambivalence that preteens on the brink of sexual knowledge feel. They know something is out there that will change them forever, but don't know quite how to put it into words. The girl playing Wendy is only a few steps ahead of Peter in that regard; she's a little more worldly and forceful but clearly doesn't know why she's pushing him to be physical. He's delightfully impish and mischievious yet too innocent to really hurt anyone but himself. Parents, don't be leary of reviews that make it sound too sexual--it's neither too mature nor too childish; the sexual tension is age-appropriate and not gratuitous, but rather, is a vital component of the movie. I would recommend it for children ages 5 or 6 and over. My 9-year-old thought it was fantastic and I think a lot of the boy-girl stuff went over her head. Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook is not to be missed! Give this man more roles--he's excellent as Hook, adding layers to the character I haven't seen in any other version. He's frightening, poignant, silly, deep, and thought-provoking. The special effects are lovely and like Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The only flaws were a less-than-believable Tinkerbelle; I had no problems with the actress but felt they should have chosen someone closer to Peter and Wendy's age to make her jealousy believable; she seems much older and so her obsession with Peter is a little creepy. Also, the extended \\"I do believe in fairies!\\" scene was over-the-top sweet to the point of embarrassment. Still, this movie more than made up for a few missteps. I can't get it out of my mind.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|A Perfect Circle's sophomore effort Thirteenth Step is so consistent it's like fruitcake:  thick with mysterious ingredients, and each slice is impossible to tell apart from the others.  This is one of those packages more effective whole than song-by-song.  The general vibe is goth ambience, bass heavy, closer to the prog-rock of Maynard James Kennan's Tool than this side project had once portended.  Kennan's vocals are sweeter here than in Tool's dark progressive rock - he keeps close to his upper register throughout.  And though the songs tend to bleed into each other (and \\"bleed\\" is the operative word), stuff does stick out.  \\"Blue\\" is the best song the Cure never wrote.  \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\", a chamber waltz, is the prettiest tune of infidelity I've heard in some time.  And the rest is murky, bittersweet, sinister.  Break out the fishnets and eyeliner.
B00005JMCN|2.0|I saw this movie a month after it came out and only saw it because of all the hype about it saying that this was one of the best movies ever.  After I was done watching the movie, I was left wondering if I had seen the same film.<br />First, the movie is way too long.  The first half hour or so is a boring preamble about the Great Depression.  Everyone who has had high school history knows what the depression was like, so we don't need a narrator to remind us!  I remember looking at my watch several times during the movie wondering when the movie<br />would actually start.<br />Second, although the actors in the movie are very good, the material that they are given are not.  We are supposed to root for Tobey Macquire and Jeff Bridge's characters, but they are both so pathetic that I couldn't make myself feel empathy for them.  The best performances in this movie were given by Gary Stevens, who is a professional jockey and not an actor and the horse who plays Seabiscuit, who is in fact a HORSE.  Perhaps it is appropriate in a movie like this that a horse upstages the lead actors, but I would have expected Jeff Bridges and Tobey Macquire to put up a little more effort.<br />Finally, I didn't like the movie because it was framed like a history channel documentary.  The movie has a narrator and the effect of the narrator being there was that I felt that I was watching some kind of afterschool History Channel documentery rather than watching these great events unfolding.  The narration made the action so much more stale.<br />Perhaps I am the only person in the world who didn't like this movie.  There is and was so much hype surrounding this film that people seem to have lost track of the fact that it isn't that good.  It would be a shame if the movie wins any awards.
1881273156|5.0|When we read that the family is the core of our society; how the family goes so will society; the death of a civilazation is the result of the family; we are now staring at a critical subject. The pressing point is that over 40% of today's marriage end in divorce. That is what makes this book so important.<br />The author states that a relationship can last 2 years before one the party gets bored and falls out of love. He emphasizes that love must be the result of will and not emotions or there could be a disaster around the corner.<br />He shows how divorce and looking for another spouse is not the answer when 40% divorce their first time; 60% divorce their second marriage and 75% divorce their third marriage. The numbers alone should encourage people to find a way to save the marriage the stats are against you when it comes to divorcing. <br />I have had the privilege of seeing countless of marriages being saved and restored as a result of my wife and I giving this book to those that were ready to give up on the marriages. This is a real book, with real results and with an easy read.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|One of the worst films of the past decade. Pauline Kael had it right. Aranofsky is the type of director who relies on visual gimmicks rather than connecting with the actors and telling a story. This film presumes to be a reflection of his own experiences. In some interviews, he claimed seeing first hand situations such as Connelly's underground strip club scene. The film has the feel of someone with limited life experience, or at least someone with no concept of storytelling.  One of the longest ninety minutes I've ever spent.

0553573403|4.0|This book is a pretty good read, but I really don't understand where all the praise is coming from.  After the first 100 pages there isn't much mystery left in the world.  It also seems like most of this book drags on for pages, then greatly advances the plot in just a few paragraphs.  I suppose most fans of the genre aren't used to the 'shocking' sex exploits (poorly written IMO) and graphic combat so people give it extra credit for that kind of stuff.<br />If you have high expectations on the book you may be dissapointed, otherwise it is better than most fantasy books out there.
B00006AL1G|5.0|Ok, I wouldn't quite go so far as to call the djs in this video lemons, but, give Doug Pray credit for assembling a video based on who was accessible for his project. It probably would've been nice to see a bunch of other influential djs, as some of the other reviewers here have mentioned, however, the movie probably wouldn't have been as watchable and entertaining for the cross section of audience members who are new and old to scratchin'. After all, there aren't many movies out there about scratchin', so if you are into it, you should support it so that more funds could be aimed at making documentaries that go a little further in depth. We played this video for a group of people who had a wide range of musical interests and they all enjoyed it. This dvd's content is entertaining and educational. So you should buy it!
B00004SCX6|5.0|The underlying message in this superlative CD is that anyone on earth, with the right lyrics, tune, accompaniment and production, can have a slick major-hit CD.  Bruce Springsteen paved the way for this concept with &quot;Born To Run&quot; in 1975, and Britney has, with &quot;Oops,&quot; taken it to the pinnacle.<br />I ordered this CD the same day I ordered &quot;On The Threshold Of A Dream&quot; by the Moody Blues.  Both CD's feature a song (though it's not the same song) titled &quot;Dear Diary.&quot;  That is a cosmic connection between doper music and bubblegum pop, the significance of which is yet to be divined.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt's autobiography, Angela's Ashes, of his difficult Irish childhood is a stunning memoir of hardship, death, and love.  McCourt beautifully recounts his ordeals of growing up Irish, Catholic, and poor and the problems he faced along the way.  Through simple diction, but superb imagery, McCourt shares with the reader the problems of growing up in the slums of New York, but the reader finds out those problems get even worse when the McCourt family moves back to Ireland.  Even in the first 10 pages, McCourt makes apparent the racism and stereotypes in the early 20th centruy that still exist today in society.  Most importantly, the application of real world problems of one boy let the reader relate those experiences to everyday life.  This book is the perfect mix of drama and humore.  Frank McCourt learns to deal with the death of his siblings, the awful stench of sewage outside of his door, and a drunken father who spends the family's welfare money on alcohol.  Even though McCourt's memori is tragic and full of sorrow, the story still exhibits a strong chararcter to live by and humorous undertones such as a longing for lemonade and fish and chips.
B00005JMTQ|4.0|\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is one of the sweetest, funniest, and most romantic films of the year.  Boasting a to-die-for cast of Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand, and Amanda Peet, director/script writer Nancy Meyers makes good use of her cast.  The screenplay is witty, funny (with plenty of laugh out loud moments), touching, romantic, and very entertaining.  \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" also reaffirms Diane Keaton's status as one of the most charming and beautiful \\"mature\\" actress working in Hollywood right now.<br />Jack Nicholson plays Harry Langer, an aged music industry executive with a preference for younger women.  In fact, he has yet to date a woman even 15 years younger than him. Marin (Peet) is his latest trophy of a girlfriend and is young, bouncy, and lively.  Harry feels that the only way he can stay young is to date younger women.  As this is a social issue nowadays, I found it especially interesting when this was heatedly debated at the beginning of the film.<br />Getting back to the plot, Harry is staying with Marin at her mother's (Keaton) beach house for the weekend in the Hamptons.  Thinking that her mother, Erica, will be away, Harry and Marin start getting a little, err, playful.  Things get a little awkward when it turns out that Erica is home and will be staying with them the whole weekend.  As any good mother should, she disapproves of her daughter's relationship with Harry, a man who is her own age!<br />Things get even more uncomfortable when Harry suffers a heart attack and is left in the care of Erica and his doctor (Reeves).  To make things even more interesting, the much younger doctor, Julian, has a thing for Erica.  You an only imagine what happens next.<br />Let me just say I was pleasantly surprised with the wit of this film.  I was not expecting to find myself gasping for air during one of the funniest scenes in the movie; when Harry is stumbling around the hospital in nothing but a hospital gown and we see alittle more of him than we would have liked...<br />The only thing holding \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" back from being a 5-star movie is the rather slow-moving final act.  I understand that it is difficult to maintain the momentum towards the end of a romantic comedy and that there has to be some agonizing soul searching/romance at the end, but it does slow the film down.  During the first ¾'s, you're loving it.  Unfortunately, by the end, you're looking at your watch and wondering when you can get out of there.  This is a shame because it leaves you with a rather lukewarm feel for the film as you walk out of the theater.  It wasn't until I got home and reminisced that I realized what a genuinely funny and charming movie it was.

B00008LDPU|3.0|I had very high hopes when I rented this collection, and at first, I thought that those hopes would be fulfilled.  The first two shorts, Final Flight of the Osiris and The Second Renaissance, Part I, were gripping and exciting.  If only the rest of the disc could have maintained that level of excitement, I would probably own the collection now.  <br />Unfortunately, the best way to describe this collection is uneven, both in terms of style and characterization.  Where Final Flight of the Osiris is a very literal, reality-grounded CG interpretation of the Matrix story, other entries (like Matriculated) are highly abstract stories that explore wildly different (and in some cases, unwatchable) variations on anime.<br />The Second Renaissance is a visceral, cautionary tale to humanity, and is also a must-see for Matrix fans. Kid's Story and Detective Story are tolerable, but not great.  Most of the others are scarcely worth mentioning.<br />It is almost as if the Wachowski brothers arranged the tracks in descending quality order, as the disc starts out strong but gets downright weird by the end.   The viewer would do well to stop after the Detective Story, which is really the final track with any substance or direct correlation to the Matrix films.
B00005JLR6|5.0|'In America' is a quasi-autobiographical work penned by director Jim Sheridan and daughters Naomi and Kirsten (herself a director).  I added \\"quasi\\" because a little research turns up that Jim Sheridan had a brother Frankie who passed away in tragic circumstances (I'm not giving anything away by telling you that).  That character woven into the 'In America' story in conjunction with the story that is obviously the current Sheridan family's own:  Irish mother and father with two young girls in tow trying to make it as immigrants in a hardscrabble NYC neighborhood in the early eighties.<br />Real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger play what are obviously the on-screen portrayals of Sheridan siblings Kirsten and Naomi.  Emma - playing younger sister Ariel - is adorable right from the get go.  Older sister Sarah is the mature, world-weary (but still sweet) Christy.  When she tells her father \\"I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year,\\" believe it.  And don't miss her stark, beautiful rendering of 'Desperado.'  Perfect.<br />In case you can't tell, I was enchanted by these two girls.  But Samantha Morton is a treat, too.  She was wonderful but obscured as the pre-cog in the fine Cruise/Spielberg film 'Minority Report.'  Here, she's front and center and luminous.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|In the UK Lost In Translation has only been on release a couple of weeks, and when I finally got round to seeing it last night I was blown away.  The movie's about two people who find each other at a time in their lives where nothing seems to fit, where they're desperate, bored and lonely.  Bob Harris (Murray) used to be a famous movie star but now he's sold out, travelling to Japan to film a set of whisky commercials.  Staying at the same hotel is Charlotte (Johannsson), who is the centre of the realisation that she doesn't know her husband of two years (Ribisi) and feels unable to explain it to anyone.  The two people eventually meet, finding solace in the amazing backdrop of Tokyo arcades, temples and karaoke bars.  Many may accuse the film of being boring, and it's true, nothing really happens.  But that's the point.  The characters don't need any plot contrivances to push their relationship forward.  This is a movie about the kind of meeting of someone you know you're in love with from moment one, your soul-mate, but knowing that it can never work out.  In a lot of ways this sounds clichéd, but LIT is anything but.  It's focus on the blossoming relationship of the couple is inspiring.<br />I've never seen Murray in a better role, his kind of world-weary character hidden behind a comic defense is nothing short of brilliant.  Johannsson is a genuine star in the making, and deserves the highest kind of praise for her performance.  Holding herself confidently with a hidden vulnerability, it's a multi-faceted performance which complements Murray's one perfectly.  There are also some nice supporting turns and characters hidden here as well.  Ribisi (narrator of Coppola's previous movie The Virgin Suicides) is just the kind of person you meet in real life who's primarily concerned with image, with having the perfect wife and the perfect job, rather than whether this is what he really wants.  There's also a hilarious character in a young actress starring in a kung-fumovie.  If Bob and Charlotte are the emotional centrepiece of the movie, then she is the laughs.  Pretentious, self-abosorbed but totally believable, she's a great comic actress.<br />Crucially, Coppola proves with Lost In Translation that she's a dab hand at creating dreamy landscapes, believable relationships and subtly complicated characters.  It's particularly impressive that she not only directed but also wrote the movie and shows her to be one of the most promising new directors in Hollywood (alongside Christopher Nolan).  Just like The Virgin Suicides, there are a lot of silent shots of landscape, of characters staring into the distance.  With Lost In Translation, much of these shots are of Johannsson visiting temples or watching flower arranging.  These provide a nice counterpoint to the humour the film makes of Japan in the director of Bob's commercials and a hilarious Japanese talk show.  LIT is an achievement of the best sort: gently humorous, beautiful, and genuinely touching.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I already had a review on this album but i need to change some things.<br />This is in my view the best Madonna cd ever. And it is my favorite cd of 2003. I think she made some mistakes with it though like not releasing the American Life video. That really slowed records sales down and it took 4 months to go platinum and fall off the charts. I like all the songs. Each song is right for every mood because most of the time you'll need a more dancy and trancy cds than those ballads and rock cds.<br />My favorite song is Love Profusion. And it just recently became my fave because i saw the video. I loved the video so i started listening to the song more. I think Love Profusion should have been the first single and Nothing Fails the second single. That way i think it would have did better and probably would have been atleast double or triple platinum. She also chose not to release the Love Profusion single in the U.S. which i think was also a mistake. And the video was only released over seas. I hope she makes one more last video which is Nothing Fails to close the American Life age of hers before moving on to another album. And i heard that she might tour but i doubt it since the album didn't do its fullest. Nobody Knows Me is also on radio play overseas. So far only 2 songs from the album went to radio in the U.S. which are American Life and Hollywood. Her e.p. is pretty good also. I like the remixes and the song Your Honesty. So this is my update. Cant wait for a new album by Madonna!!
B00006RU5B|4.0|As far as I was concerned hard rock peaked with &quot;Purple&quot; from Stone Temple Pilots. Thanks to Audioslave my faith has been restored. This is one of the first albums in a very long time where I don't find myself skipping tracks. Chris Cornell has still got it as one of the most distinguishable voices in rock and roll. I liked some of Rage's stuff but not enough to buy an album. After lisenting to this, I am now a bonfide Tom Morello fan and relize he was the reason behind my limited appeal to Rage. Even though all are good, my favorite tracks are &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;, &quot;Gasoline&quot;, &quot;Set it Off&quot;, and &quot;I am the Highway.&quot; A refreshingly sincere and profound effort for its genre. It's nice to know that there is still a quality hard rock alternative to the Top 40 schlock out there.
B00004SAJG|5.0|I suppose this Japanese version of Strangers Expanded is a collectors Item because it is imported. It seems to be identical to the 1999 Capitol reissue of the 1979 midwest concert tour live album, Strangers in the night. Elsewhere on this website you will find the 1999 release, however the track list is way wrong. Use this track list as the correct one. Well worth the price of the CD. It is definitely the prize of my UFO collection.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|THIS MIGHT STILL BE VAN HALEN'S BEST ALBUM TO DATE. THIS IS A ROCK N ROLL MASTERPIECE. THESE ARE THE SONGS THAT NO ROCK FAN SHOULD BE WITHOUT; ''RUNNIN WITH THE DEVIL'', ''YOU REALLY GOT ME'', ''LITTLE DREAMER'', ''JAMIE'S CRYIN'', AND ''I'M THE ONE''. VAN HALEN WAS AT THEIR DEFINITE BEST WHEN DAVID LEE ROTH WAS THEIR SINGER. SAMMY HAGAR DESTROYED VAN HALEN WITH HIS AWFUL SINGING. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ROCK ALBUMS EVER MADE. GET THIS NOW! THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST ROCK MUSIC YOU CAN OWN.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The history of television includes many shows that were magnificent that didn't start out as ratings monsters. But some were given the chance to succeed. Cheers was one. Star Trek tanked in the first season and only caught on only because the network gave it a chance to succeed, giving it two more seasons -- now it's a 'franchise.' Firefly is right up there with the best television that I've ever seen and I have to wonder what the suits at Fox were thinking or smoking (or not) to pull the plug on this one. This is some of the best writing and near-perfect ensemble casting that you will find. Edgey, witty, funny, very cool and all I can say is I am glad that Fox at least had the good sense to put this on DVD. This is brilliant stuff and all I'd say to its writer/director Joss Whedon is that Police Squad tanked on TV and went on to be a film monster with Leslie Nielsen bringing life to David Zucker's writing and directing. I hope the same fate awaits Joss Whedon -- he certainly deserves that kind of success.
1400049628|5.0|Let's face it: at one time or another we've all faced a zombie scare we aren't prepared for.  And yes, the local constabulary usually cleans things up with a minimum of fuss, but what happens when things go wrong and the cavalry doesn't arrive?  That, my friends, is the day that Max Brooks' \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" saves your life.  With several millennia worth of field experience distilled into a manageable 254 pages, everything you need to know to survive the coming war with the undead can be found in these pages.  Your life and the lives of those you love are at stake, act now and be prepared!<br />OK, so that paragraph was obviously tongue in cheek, but hopefully in conveys some sense of what Brooks' remarkable \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is like.  While obviously a parody of both the horror genre and civil defense/survivalist manuals, it maintains an \\"all-business\\" demeanor, never once cracking the façade to reveal the underlying humoristic intent.  The result is a book that is, when taken as a whole, a funny, incredibly thorough work of satire.  However, at the same time, page-by-page, it is a rather accomplished addition to zombie horror.<br />Starting with zombie physiology and then moving on to weapons, tactics, long-term strategy and history Brooks has produced a manual which has a thoroughness that belies the absurdity of its subject.  Point by point he discusses the pros and cons of rifles, machetes and flamethrowers, then considers the optimal defensive positions for various types of outbreaks.  After an extensive discussion of survival in a zombie doomsday scenario, he lays out zombie outbreaks through history, and what their implications are.  Throughout, entries are extensively cross-referenced and alternative courses of action are always weighed for potential risks and benefits.<br />The remarkable thing about all this is that Brooks has managed to infuse a tension, and urgency into his manual that makes for great reading.  Part post-apocalypticfiction, part \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and part \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch, this is a book that should hold appeal across a broad range of genres.  Thorough without being dry, creepy without being clichéd, and funny without relying on cheap laughs, \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is undoubtedly one of the most original books I have ever read, and one that I enjoyed reading immensely.  If you appreciate any or all of these genres, or if you just enjoy a well executed, original idea, this is definitely a book you'll want to check out.<br />And remember...Tomorrow may be too late, read this book today!<br />Jake Mohlman
B000002AGE|5.0|This is a great place to start if you are starting to listen to fusion. All the songs are melodic,jazzy,funky,and very fun to listen to. Wayne and Joe are of course incredible like always but they have new guy,jaco pastorius covering all bass tracks this time.My fav track are 1,2,and7.Dont hesitate to buy this jazz clasic.
B00000GV55|5.0|So you went here even tho Amazon is out of it? Good choice - you can find this elsewhere, and I humbly request that you read my review, while you're here.....<br />   Recently, I have been listening to this, Henry Cow's 1st album, and Unrest, their second, a hell of a lot. It seems I am going to need everything they ever did, because they were fearless innovators who were obviously not content with the status quo. I tend to get bored easily with albums if they don't surprise and/or fascinate me. Weell, this is a humdinger, a fantastic jazzy avant-garde disc that manages to sound improvised and composed at the same time (which might have been the case). Lots of different instruments pop up and out-of-nowhere edits as well. Insane one minute, solemn the next, it just is mesmerizing; to me, anyway. But I tend to lean towards STRANGE ALBUMS FROM EARLY '70'S EUROPEAN BANDS anyway.... <br />   Now the first time I heard it, I thought it was the weirdest thing I'd ever laid ears on and just kinda put it away, scratching my head. So it has taken time for me to get used to, as with John Zorn, but I absolutely love it now. There are even some beautiful dreamy passages. I'm not sure anyone was this fearless in 1973. Wonderfully unpredictable!
B00008PW2D|5.0|If your a sex and the city fan then you'll love this season just as much as the others.  A must have for a true fan?  And for those of you who dont like it?  Why after 5 years are you still watching?
B00004X01U|3.0|With the release of \\"Ray of Light\\" Madonna complained that she liked techno music but never thought it sounded very emotional. Luckily, she succeeded in imbibing that CD with very emotional songs (except the unexplainable, messy, unmelodic,incredibly poorly sung, train-wreck title track). \\"Music\\", however, contains two wretched techo tracks \\"Impressive Instant\\" and \\"Runaway Lover\\" which are thoroughly UNemotional. If her intention was to appeal to die-hard techno fans with these tracks, she probably succeeded. She did the genre well. I feel like I'm in a gay bathhouse when I hear them. The title track, while bouncy and danceable, has some of the most uninspired lyrics Madonna has written to date. It's a well-produced and sparse track, but relatively uninteresting. \\"It's Amazing\\" is a decent song, but basically a rehash of \\"Beautiful Stranger.\\" Madonna does succeed on the last track, the acoustic \\"Gone\\". \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is an interesting acoustic-inspired effort, but too choppy. She carries the acoustic motif to \\"American Life\\" in a more successful manner. This CD appears to be more transitional for Madonna.
B00008PW2D|5.0|I loved season 5 just as much as the last four, and I couldnt wait for it to come out on dvd so it could take it's place on the shelf with the other four.  As for the shorter season people seem to be complaining about?  Well you knew it was going to be shorter if you saw it on HBO.  And if you did'nt then learn how to read the descriptions on items before you buy, it says right there 8 episodes.  Im not complaining about the price, it's two discs, four hours, it's still comaprable to buying two full length pictures.  So either buy it or dont, but people please learn how to read and stop complaining about the price and the length.  The show is just as good as ever.  Maybe even better!
B0000636UN|3.0|I happen to be a huge fan of Sheryl Crow, but admittedly, this disk is a disappointment. There are a few gems (namely \\"Soak up the Sun\\"; \\"Steve McQueen\\") but overall, the tunes are forgettable. \\"You're an Original\\" is particularly irkesome; it sounds like it was specifically penned as a jingle. In fact, hasn't it already been featured in some automobile ad? This is easily the weakest of her four studio CDs; odd, considering she has done more co-writing on this one, save her debut. However, Ms. Crow is a talent to be reckoned with. I have no doubt her next studio effort will exceed even my lofty expectations of her.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|When I saw that Coldplay had released this great DVD.. I just couldn't wait...   30 minutes later, I had mine!!! And I wasn't disappointed...  I was in Toronto for their show in september 2002 I think.. and that day was the most wonderful day of my life... And I was sad to see the day was over... I knew that as the month's went by, I was forgetting more and more of the details of the show and the great feeling I felt listening to their unbelievable music. So I was thrilled when I saw that they extended their tour and that they were coming to Ottawa and Montreal... So I purchased FLOOR tickets for the Ottawa show and I relived that wonderful experience a second time... But I tought that the Toronto show was slightly better... I think the fact that I was much closer for the Ottawa show was not so good because the visula effects with the lights are much better when your in the back...  Anyways....   Now let's talk about the DVD...   the only song that is not there and should be is Spies and the only only only thing is that I wish the camera would stey still a bit more....  they are always changing and you don't have the time to focus on something... I wish the DVD producers could someday make a DVD in wich you can choose the section you are sitting in and see the whole show from there...  there would be like : in front of the stage, in the back... left and right... And for those who like these moving cameras there could be that version included also... I think it would be great.<br />In the end<BR>There's only Coldplay<BR>And Oh my friends, Coldplay is the best band you'll ever know...<br />Buy this CD and Just let yourself float to the sound of Coldplay.. It'll change your life... If it hasn't already  :-)
B00008S2VG|5.0|What's all this fuss about \\"American Life\\" being Madonna's worst effort? This is a consistently better CD than was \\"Music\\" (which, incidentally, has some of Madonna's worst music to date, save Erotica). This CD takes the best aspects of \\"Music\\" and tweeks them to perfection. For example, it's nice to hear Madonna stick with the acoustic motif on many of these songs; it was completely underused on Music and suits her voice probably better than her critics, or possibly even Madonna herself, could have imagined. Many critics contend that Madonna \\"repeats\\" herself on this CD. This is unfair since Madonna always repeats herself in some fashion, while breaking new ground (well, at least new ground for Madonna). No one complained that Madonna recycled the lyrics for \\"Frozen\\" from \\"Open Your Heart.\\" We just listened gleefully to how she newly packaged them. <br />There are many good tracks on this CD, although the standout is easily \\"Nothing Fails.\\" Perhaps Madonna shouldn't have pulled her \\"American Life\\" video. It's the first time I can think of Madonna bowing to pressure (or potential pressure). Maybe more people would have given this disk a listen...

B00005JLT5|3.0|Highlights: Adrien Brody's powerfully restrained performance; the horror of war well-displayed; engrossing plot.<BR>Lowpoints: Congrats, this is the 1,000,000th war film Hollywood exuded.<br />Conclusion: Roman Polanski has a confident but unoriginal grip over the film - the story of a Jew escaping Nazis is invigorating, there are quite a few dramatic scenes, and the impact is strong, but...not long-lasting. It's EASY to make people cry if you show an old man being thrown out a window from his wheel-chair. Mass murder will always evoke tears, and when it's incorporated through a poignant story about WWII brought to life by a classic director, the film is an immediate Oscar candidate. I expected more subtlety from Polanski - luckily, Adrien Brody's silent, touching performance saves the film - it is still a part of the WWII infestation ('Schindler's List', 'Stalingrad', 'The Grey Zone', 'Jacob's Liar', 'The War Zone', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Windtalkers', 'Pearl Harbor', 'The Thin Red line'...should I go on?)
B000002KIE|1.0|The whole punk thing was manufactured by mainstream corporates, and all those mindless sheep think that they aren't conforming and that they have minds of there own, but sorry your entire scene is a lie and was made by the media. Sorry losers, guess your gonna have to invent your own scene.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|How anyone can dislike this album is a mystery to me.<BR>I guess too many people are expecting a rougher sound similar to that of tool. Although i love both bands, i must say apc is definately my favorate over the two. And i consider Aenima the &quot;dark side of the moon&quot; of the 90s, thats not an easy task to accomplish.<br />APC has once again create a beautiful album that can only be compaired to their previous. Managing to break away from the typical &quot;pearl jam sensitive&quot; band stereotype, and creating something very uniquely their own.<br />Each song on this album is majestic and powerful in its own way and each requires you to listen to. Rock has been in a slump for the past 10 years, however This is easily be the best album of 2003.
0064400557|5.0|\\"Where is Papa going with that ax?\\" said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast. This story is about a girl who really loves her little animal. At first, Fern's little animal was always teased by other farm animals. Will the little animal still be teased by anybody? The little animal is a pig named Wilbur. He was a little pig who has no mother. Nobody but Fern takes care of him. Wilbur is very unfamous until.........<br />I enjoy reading Charlotte's Web for a number of reasons. First is that the book is a very wonderful book for children ages seven and up. Also it is a great book that explains why the animal is sad or not. I think it'll be a great book for children to read. E.B. White also makes the animals talk in real life. This book tells why Wilbur is unhappy. I can't relate this book to any other books because the other books don't tell why that person or animal is sad. But this book does.<br />My favorite part of the book is when Wilbur got a prize. I was also glad when Wilbur got a friend. (A \\"best \\" friend.) I like Wilbur's friend because she had always helped Wilbur with his problems. My other favorite part is when Wilbur was a baby because he looked so cute. One part I dislike is  when Wilbur's best friend had died. That part was so sad. I thought that Wilburs friend (best) will not die but to my surprise, the friend did! I was so unhappy. If you're a fan of animal books, read this book!<br />I had really sad feelings because nobody should die in this story, but it did. I should recommend this book for kids in second grade and up. You should also read E.B.White's other books such as Stuart Little and The Trumpet Of The Swan. They're great! Check  it out!
0385504209|4.0|It seems that many of the reviewers were reading a different book. Anybody with a pulse will find this book exciting. It seems that the people who did not enjoy this book were determined to dislike its content for personal reasons. Brown offers controversial historical facts that are intertwined with a compelling mystery. In addition, in the opinion of some of the literary snobs on this site, authors are not supposed to produce anything that appeals to the masses. What a load of C***. Wake up! Reading is for pleasure and in this case Brown provides exactly that. An easy, informative and enjoyable read. Lighten up and go with the story. Not everything needs to be &quot;War and Peace&quot;.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a great movie, but it is obviously not for everyone, especially those who lack a creative spirit. I read one review that downcasted the Japanese for not making the characters look Asian enough! And another said that this movie is too &quot;different and weird.&quot; How sad. Others complained that this movie is too scary for kids (it says right on it - PG: For Some Scary Moments). And indeed there are! Don't rent it for your 4-year olds and complain about that it if they get scared. Anyway, to my opinion about the movie:<br />BAD: This movie isn't perfect, and there are a few MINOR things that bothered me. First, the noses. When Chihiro turns sideways, her nose looks oddly shaped and flat.<br />And last, the relationship between Yababa's sister and Chihiro wasn't developed enough. They share a scene with each other for about 5 minutes before Chihiro has to leave, and they are saying their good-byes as if they have been with each other for years!<br />GOOD: The creativity of this movie is astounding! That's probably why some people don't like it. Maybe it's just too creative for some people. (Look at our music industry, for example. Since when did people enjoy a little creativity in music? But I won't go there). Anyway, there are a lot of weird creatures and spirits and a talking frog! You should also see some of the food the parents eat, as well as everything else, but there are too many things to type about.<br />And also the originality of this movie... I haven't seen any movie even remotely like this one. If you have noticed the protaganists and antagonists, they are not the typical good vs. evil. Like Yababa (the main antagonist). I don't think she is evil, although she does unlikeable things. She is, however, trustworthy and she takes care of her giant baby! And the protaganist (Chihiro being the main one) is at first unlikeable (her screaming over everything... sheesh), but you grow to sympathize with her and like her throughout the movie. And one character (No-Face) switches from neutral to protagonist to antagonist to protagonist again.  <br />Also, the weird plot and setting (they enter this other world that seems to be in another world...). It's kind of hard to explain without giving everything away. You really have to see it for yourself.<br />And the dubbing/voice acting was actually all right! I really liked the voices for all the characters, from the actor for Chihiro who really puts emotion into her character, and to Yababa with her throaty voice. Everyone was perfect.<br />Also, I'm really glad with Miyazaki, because it feels like he was making this movie for himself (this movie does not follow any formula like in a lot of American movies). There are a lot of climaxes and resolutions in this movie and it feels as if he made up this movie as he went along, which in this case is a good thing.<br />Overall, a great movie. Just don't complain about this movie because it has violence or the characters didn't look Asian enough. That's what G movies are made for- people who cannot enjoy creativity and a piece of art that was made for Miyazaki's pleasure. This is definitely not for close-minded people.
B0000DCGT1|5.0|It was about time someone made another horse film!  This is a great film whether you are a horse person or not.  Having read the book and watched the film, I felt this filmmaker(Gary Ross) did a great job wrapping you up in the true drama that the nation felt at the time of The Depression.  Everyone has felt like they were an underdog, just like Seabiscuit was, which between the time period and being the underdog is how Seabiscuit became America's horse.  Through I was very excited to see how well the characters were portrayed through Tobby Maguire (Red Polland), Jeff Bridges (Charles Howard), and Chris Cooper (Tom Smith).  Tom Smith's character left me wondering if there was any connection to The Horse Whisperer because of his training techniques.  Even &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; was well planned out character of what horse to pick for the part.  This movie did leave out a lot of action that happened between the races and the effects of traveling across the nation multiple times, but to include it would have been very difficult.  I really enjoyed the fact that the producers did not make Seabiscuit win every race like some movies tend to do.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Superman's protrayal in media other than comics (and in some cases comics as well) hasn't always been well-recieved or well made.  The first couple movies were all right, but after 12 movies, (or however many there were,) the well tends to run dry.  Cartoons and other media, such as games and CD's, have always seemed to be a mixed bag.  So doing a Superman show nowadays was always kinda risky.  It had to fit the tone of today's comics as well as appeal to fans who have been around for much longer.  Myself, being a fan since, well, birth, always held a certian sense of skepticisim and doubt when news of another series based on the Man of Steel reached my ears.  Especially when I heard that it was going on the WB, infamous for shows like &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; and the like.  The idea of an entire series based on his childhood (or more specifically, his high school years,) was a promising concept. I didn't want Clark Kent becoming another whiny teen.<br />Thankfully, my doubts and fears quickly subsided as I watched the first season of &quot;Smallville,&quot; which is thankfully all gathered into this huge (6 discs?? ) set, which gets you all 21 episodes of the first season, including the pilot.  The show itself is a wonder to behold, filled with great performances and a wondeful setting, great dialogue, and the stories themslves continue to suprise and amaze.  As a Superman fan, it's great to see these cool little moments of a young Clark Kent having to adjust and develop his powers as they appear - as well as try to live a normal life as a teenager with a crush (Lana Lang, which again, fans will love,) and other typical teenager issues.<br />Many characters from the comics (Clark, Lana, Jonathan and Martha Kent, as well as Lex Luthor, and Pete Ross, who is a fairly minor character in the comics), as well as some new ones, (Chloe - Clark's good friend and Whitney - Lana's boyfriend)combine into a well crafted and believeable cast.  Fans will snicker and adore allof the little ironic moments, all of which hint at what Clark will eventually become.  Little parts here and there, but there nonetheless.  The biggest one is the fact that Clark Kent and Lex Luthor... are best friends.  I couldn't count the number of times that there was a feeling of foreboding and destinic action in almost every scene with these two, my favorite was when Clark asked Lex how long he thought that they'd be friends.  Lex simply replied, &quot;Our friendship will be the stuff of legend.&quot;  He was certianly right.  Best writing ever, for this type of series, anyway.<br />There are always going to be comparisons to other stuff like &quot;Creek,&quot; and it does kinda steer that way, but it can't be helped.  &quot;Creek&quot; was about a bunch of teens growing up and finding themselves.  &quot;Smallville&quot; is esentially about the same thing, only add superpowers and tons of special effects to the mix.  Another thing that's unique about this show, in terms of a superhero show, is that it is more about the alter ego than the hero.  It's a Superman show that's about Clark Kent.  Definately pick it up.  If you're a fan, you'll enjoy it immensly.  If you're just getting into it, it's a great way to start.
B00003CWRX|5.0|To be cinematographically loyal to a Real Life Story is impossible, and this is because the only real truth to any story, is the point of view of its protagonist. Once an author takes the facts and expose them in any particular media, that point of view becomes a third person in the events, the objectiveness of those facts then become subjective to the intuition of the author. Now, the intention of that author has to be honorable, and that is: to honor the Truth of that story he or she is trying to tell, as accurate and close to the point of view of the people that went trough those events, that way the beholder will take that information through a third, and will judge it accurate, inaccurate or hypocrite, whatever that information is objectively right, or subjectively wrong. All the author need is: first hand information, objectiveness away from a partial judgment, a real understanding of that story, plus a real care for it, and confidence in a deep research work to be credit with. This is as close as you can hope to get, then you can digest it. <BR>When The Insider began shooting, Jeffery Wigand was still on litigation against Big Tobacco. Many of the specific information couldn't be disclose to Michael Mann and his crew, so he and Eric Roth took license and approach the story as close to the emotional truth of the protagonist with the intention to portrait the long way towards redemption and inner strength, a docudrama including the personal side of it. In no easy sense Jeffrey Wigand is a hero, but an ordinary man in extraordinary conditions, in the other hand, Lowell Bergman is an idealistic man who's moral professional ethics are about to be past over. Corruption, manipulation, psychological and financial aggression, personal interests, are the issues against these two man are tested with. How they survive and manage their way through victory, is a real statement of Integrity and Moral Truth.<BR>Based on a article published by Vanity Fair called, The Man WhoKnew Too Much, The Insider is pure journalism language. The always interesting Michael Mann, narrates with integrity and courage, the events about two-man disclosure campaign against Tobacco giant Brown and Williamson, meaning absolute power in every sense. Jeffrey Wigand is set into despair when Big Tobacco C.E.O.'s threatens him with a massive sued in case he doesn't sign an extension of the confidentiality agreement he never intended to dishonor. And it is here when Lowell Bergman (a producer for 60 minutes), enters his counterpart to attempt the exposition of the real Truth of the Cigarette industry, and that is: cigarettes are a delivery devise for nicotine, light it up, put it in your mouth, and it will get you fix. Jeffrey Wigand's life will crush against this sons of bit', and Lowell Bergman will be betrayed by his own office and friends when C.B.S. Corporate pushes hard on C.B.S. News to not go with the story. Lowell and Wigand will endure, but after a nerve breaking battle of a life time, at the end the exclusive is lost, but the Story will be cast, and integrity and peace of mind will find its way again in the strong Jeffrey Wigand, and the audacious Lowell Bergman. <BR>Michael Mann gives you a lesson in cinema, his directorial skills are proved in this masterpiece, keen, powerful, and honest, just brilliant and much close to the real Truth as you can hope to get. The great Al Pacino portraits Lowell Bergman in an intense canvas of human will, excellent. Russell Crowe performance is absolutely impressive, all the complicated ways of Jeffrey Wigand, his despair, his moral debate of disclose this much important information, his emotiveness in times of no hope, all this is perfectly done by Crowe in his highly inspiring work (Actually, the best performance of 1999. Crowe lost the Academy Award against Kevin Spacey for his also great performance in American Beauty). Veteran actor Christopher Plummer also gives an excellent performance as the legendary and arrogant Mike Wallace (Wallace actually protested for this, but think about it, after all the accolades he has receive in his long career; Could it be possible that he just turned a little too cocky over the decades? So many people kissing your behind for so much time, must have some effect in your personality. Isn't that just so unfair Mike?). The rest of the cast is also great. <BR>A perfect adapted screen play, a beautiful and accurate photography, and an amazing music score by the great Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke, brings more emotion to the story (other musical credits includes: Graeme Revell, Massive Attack, etc), unforgettable. The Insider is that magnificent movie, that the Academy so often tends to past over and forget when then moment of Truth (in most cases, the best movie of the year), even with its 7 nominations, the Insider didn't get one single award, another huge oversight (Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock never in their life time received an Academy Award for Best Director, such a thing completely discredits this highly prestigious Award). Never mind. <BR>The DVD is good, a quality visual transferring and a fine 5.1 Dolby Digital are great, the problem is that the DVD lacks of extras, just a production Featurette, the Trailer, and a Scene Comparison with the original script, is all that there is. I would have love to see the entire 60 minutes original Interview, and a 25 minutes Making Of, any way, the transferring is great, and that's all that matters. A must for your DVD collection.<BR>Interesting enough is that the movie talks about the Cigarette Industry in many ways, and goes even further with the manipulation surrounding it's addictive product, but never in the film one single person is shown smoking a cigarette.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|First, I am a HUGE fan of Errol Morris. He manages to capture the psychology of his subjects so well.<br />In the case of McNamara, he confronts McNamara with the analytic paradigm that led him to war. He asks a simple question, how can you justify the things that you did, perhaps only in a support role, in raining war on people both in Japan and Viet Nam. McNamara does not back down, and Morris does not force his opinion onto the viewer too much or McNamara. One is left to ponder statements of McNamara's like, \\"If we lost, I would be convicted as a war criminal.\\" Or McNamara responding to a question about Viet Nam, \\"Look, I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't. I'd rather be damned if I don't.\\"<br />What you see so clearly is the humanity of a man who, rightly or wrongly -- I happen to think rightly -- helped lead a country to war and was, at least indirectly, responsible for probably a million deaths.

B00000K0DT|5.0|I saw this movie once and it has become my favorite movies, This DVD is a must to have in your collection. Bryan singer was brilliant and the actors in the film were astounding!..WITH A TWIST!, AND A TWIST, AND A TWIST!!..WITH A WHOPPER OF AN ENDING!...need I say more!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't seen the series, or haven't seen it in its proper sequence (thanks to the 'geniuses' at Fox), buy or borrow the DVD set --you won't regret it!  If you love great sci-fi, or just great characters & story-telling, I guarantee you'll be hooked by the end of the pilot.  Funny, intelligent, unconventional, engrossing, and even at times --touching.<BR>Have to admit, I'm not surprised that the show didn't last, given the way it was mis-managed and (not)promoted by Fox execs --who by the way, should be indefinitely 'detained' at Gitmo!  Fox is quickly becoming the graveyard of terrific shows cut down before they've had a chance at building an audience --what a tragedy!  At least there's a small ray of hope Firefly may fly again, thanks to the (potential) Universal movie deal --see [...]
B000088E6D|5.0|Since seeing Buble featured on EXTRA the other night, I found myself doing a little research. Along with IN TOUCH magazine they had listed him as one of the Ten Hottest Hunks to watch for in 2004 - he has those movie star looks - so I then had to see if the voice could match... I have not taken his cd out of my player since I bought it yesterday - it's HOT - like him! <BR>I spent hours on his fansites and discovered that the effect he has made on me is one that has spread around the globe. He has become an international favorite virtually overnight. And no wonder. Here's what the cd shapes up like:<br />1.Fever (this is HOT! it gives me Feverrrrrrrr)<BR>2.Moondance (move over Van, this take is best by far)<BR>3.Kissing a Fool (George M, THIS is how to turn them on...)<BR>4.For once in my Life (talk about uplifting!)<BR>5.How can you mend a Broken Heart (with backups by the Beegees!)<BR>6.Summer wind (you can feel the breeze...Franky move over!)<BR>7.You'll never find another love like mine (make me wish....)<BR>8.Crazy little thing called Love (fun and fast)<BR>9.Put your head on my shoulder (Mr.Anka must be proud)<BR>10.Sway (I am, and do, every time I hear it!!)<BR>11.The way you look tonight (tender and romantic, so fine)<BR>12.Come fly with me (anywhere Michael, anywhere)<BR>13.That's All (what love songs were meant to sound like)<BR>My average song rating? 10 out of 10 - a perfect score!
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is an extremely interesting book.  It is also very fun, fast paced, and hard to put down.  I thought the research was fantastic, as was the story.  Sure it is hard to believe some of Langdon and Sophie's miraculous escapes, but it is worth it if you can get past that point.<br />I almost stopped reading the book after 50 pages.  I could not get into it.  But after what I thought was a slow start, I couldn't put the thing down for two days and finished the rest of it.
B00012FXB8|4.0|I remember the long wait between the release of this movie and &quot;Aliens&quot; and the great amount of anticipation that was built up around this movie considering how extraordinary the first two films were and just imagining how great this one was &quot;going&quot; to be.  Then its release date came and it received generally bad reviews and collectively, the majority of the fans were highly disappointed by it, including myself.  That being said, I was quite reluctant to spend the money on this DVD but after reading some of the other positive reviews I decided to give this film one more chance and now, after having watched it again I would have to say I've completely changed my mind.  <br />Alien 3 just wasn't as bad as I remembered it to be from that one time viewing in the theater so many years ago and in fact, stylistically, it's a movie that was ahead of its time.  Ultimately, I think what turned so many people off of this film when it was released is that it was so dramatically different from the first two that it initially just didn't seem as though it belonged in the mythos that is the Alien legacy.  The one thing about this film that does make it drag is its pacing.  What the director appeared to be reaching for was the same feel that &quot;Alien&quot; engendered but in the end, in reaching for that intense atmosphere didn't always work and only resulted in the pace slowing down and too little suspense.  As stated above though, thematically it was just years ahead of its time and I believe, were it a movie that were originally released more recently, with some minor changes, it might've garnered much more success in the theaters.<br />Performance wise, Sigourney Weaver does just as wonderful a job with this film as she did with the first two and, not to mention, she co-produced the film, further showing her support for the script and this addition to the Alien mythos.  Charles S. Dutton's role in the film is &quot;over the top,&quot; as his acting usuallyis and it fits quite well with the character.<br />David Fincher, who took up the directing mantle for &quot;Alien 3&quot; deserves a fair amount of credit for the thematic style of this film, bringing the original story and screenplay to fruition.  Twelve years ago, I would've said don't ever let the man direct again, but this second viewing of &quot;Alien 3&quot; and after seeing some of the other films he's directed since, I would definitely have to say that he is a very good director!<br />This Collector's Edition release comes with two options, the original 1992 Theatrical version or a 2003 Special Edition.  One note of caution, the Special Edition doesn't really add too much to the film, but of the small portion that is added, it helps to set up the story that much better.  The THX certification and 5.1 Dolby Surround is perfect for the film, bringing out the score beautifully!<br />The Premise:<br />As Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop are slumbering away in hyper sleep, hoping to next wake up near Earth, the ship suddenly encounters problems of the alien kind.  Being the good futuristic starship that it is, it kindly ejects Ripley and the bodies of her companions on a prison planet.  Ripley awakens to find herself on this prison planet and not long thereafter, prisoners start showing up dead and Ripley herself finds that her worst nightmare has come true...<br />What follows from there, as stated above, is most certainly not the best of the Alien series but it is most definitely a lot better movie than my initial assessment of it had been.  I would definitely recommend this film to any and all fans of the Alien series, as I believe it plays an integral part in the mythos.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-1992 Theatrical version (Deleted/Extended Scene Index) &amp; Alien vs. Predator Teaser Trailer<BR>-2003 Special Edition (Deleted Footage Marker)<BR>-&quot;Development:  Concluding the Story&quot; Featurette<BR>-&quot;Tales of the Wooden Planet:  Vincent Ward's Vision&quot; Featurette<BR>-&quot;Pre-production, Part III&quot; Featurette<BR>-&quot;Xeno-Erotic:  H.R.

068484267X|4.0|In the novel, Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, he personally gives his own accounts of poverty in the uptown area of New York and then in Limerick, Ireland. This story of family life through struggles brings out the worst aspects of life, along with the miraculous times. The novel goes from the flooding of their house, rats,lice, lavatory, and absolutely gross living conditions of the lowest class to the beauty of close family connections, open bluntness, and ultimate love. I for one, extremely enjoy the breaks in the novel where Mr. McCourt takes a hardship and turns it into something the audience can relate to and laugh about. In the case when the boys are starving of hunger at lunch time, the author could have sympathized with the boys, but instead he makes them go out to the country side orchards, eat apples, and then has a hilarious account on how the young men had to go to opposite ends to use the restroom with leaves as toilet paper.I personally love the sickening and vile stories, they make my stomach turn, but put a smile to my face. Not only do I adore this in the book, but I really enjoyed the development of characters through concrete detail, especially Malachy McCourt, the father. Much of the audience could see the father as the antagonist, since he continues to bring the family down to the worst of circumstances time and time again from his horrible drinking habits and lack of good intuition over responsible parenting, but I find myself having all kinds of sympathies and unique likenesses of him. Mr. Malachy, even though, he may totally abolish and destroy the families hopes at certain instances he always does little gestures that show his kind, sincere character of caring. In such cases, when he never eats his dinner for more to be leftover for the children and wife, or when he gives the boys pennies time to time for saying they will die for Ireland, or when he makes up different stories to tell Frank in the mornings. In all, the novel was one of kind, full of diverse complexities of bluntness and struggle. I would definitely read this novel a million times over again, and I do not read much!!!
0345452577|4.0|In this novel, author Kellerman has taken a break from his series of books about psychologist Alex Delaware to offer us a new main character, Jeremy Carrier.  Although Jeremy is also a psychologist, he is younger than Delaware and practices in a hospital (as opposed to Delaware's private practice).  Yes, he does become involved in a series of mysterious murders--including the murder of his own girlfriend--but unlike Delaware, Jeremy is working on his own rather than with the police.<br />Although this book definitely contains some similarities to the Delaware series, Kellerman has done a nice job of creating an interesting new cast of characters.  Furthermore, the use of a new protagonist has allowed him to break away from the staleness of the recent Delaware books and to return to some of the energy and intensity of his earlier works.  While not as good as Kellerman's best non-Delaware novel, The Butcher's Theater, The Conspiracy Club reminds the reader of Kellerman's continued potential for writing great works of suspense.
B000001FRY|4.0|\\"Boy\\" takes a bit of getting used to if you grew up on mid-period U2 stuff like \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" but their debut album kicks major ... -- it's a shimmering, glorious piece of work, filled with The Edge's soon-to-become-famous chiming guitars and Bono's gutsy (not to mention indecipherable) singing. Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. leap into the music with incredible authority, establishing themselves as one of the best rhythm sections anywhere.<br />Best songs: \\"I Will Follow,\\" \\"An Cat Dubh,\\" \\"Into the Heart\\" (check the bass!), the extraordinary \\"Out of Control,\\" \\"Stories for Boys,\\" and \\"The Ocean.\\"
1401200842|5.0|Collecting the final issues of the \\"Hush\\" storyarc by Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee; just about everything comes full circle as the storyline comes to a close.  Loeb's talent for underwriting comes to a head as secrets are revealed, although I must say that the identity of Hush wasn't something we all didn't see coming.  More of Batman's infamous enemies surface: including the Riddler, Clayface, and even the Joker in a pivotal scene.  Lee's art is superb as always, and his rendering of Catwoman is plain mouthwatering.  Since \\"Hush\\" was a huge hit for DC, Loeb and Lee have promised to come back to Batman to write a follow up, but whether or not it can live up to this storyarc will remain to be seen.
B000001EAQ|3.0|U2 took a giant leap into the unknown void of techno-electro-pop (at this late date I can think of no better description) and came out with &quot;Pop,&quot; not one of their most successful albums but an interesting addition to the catalog, nonetheless.<br />According to many sources, &quot;Pop&quot; was either hurriedly finished or released before U2 were completely done with it. That's sort of hard to believe; the album sounds great, though it does contain a few puzzling dead-ends (&quot;Miami,&quot; &quot;Mofo,&quot; &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot;). This is not the same band that audiences were used to hearing back in the 1980s, which turned off a lot of longtime listeners. But I'm convinced they had to go through this phase -- had to make a record like &quot;Pop&quot; -- if they were to survive and move on. Which is ultimately what they did.<br />Best cuts: &quot;Discotheque&quot; (overblown, but it still rocks), &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot; (U2 erotica?), &quot;Staring at the Sun,&quot; &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; (underrated), &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; and &quot;Please.&quot;
B00009W0U4|2.0|&lt;This review contains spoilers.&gt;<br />There is no doubt that Irreversible is pretty well directed, that it is well acted, that many of its scenes are superbly realistic. The special effects, especially during the fire extinguisher scene, are nothing short of remarkable. But as far as I understand it, film is a storytelling medium, and for me this movie fails as a story.<br />You can't really sympathize with Markus as he hunts down the rapist because you don't yet know what happened. You don't understand how he and Pierre came to be in this situation, and all you feel is revulsion as you watch one man beat another man's brains in.<br />Gradually you learn how the situation spiraled out of control, and you learn that Markus ignored his girlfriend at a party until she left by herself and was brutally raped. And then you see a little of their love for each other, but by then it's too late.<br />Had the story been told in forward time, it might have worked better. But because of the timeline, none of the characters appear sympathetic except Alex, and she ends up in the hospital, scarred for life. Okay, so sometimes horrible things happen to people. You wish you could go back and change them, but you can't. So what? Do any of the characters undergo change or discover something about life or themselves? I guess Pierre does, the gentle ex-boyfriend who stumbles upon his capacity to kill, but I don't buy it. He follows Markus around the entire movie, trying to calm him down, and then while trying to defend him, he suddenly finds the rage to hammer a man 22 times in the head with a fire extinguisher? 22 times? This fellow would probably drop the extinguisher and run after the first disfiguring blow. But you don't know that at the beginning of the movie (end of the story), so you go with it. You have no choice. And later, when you see him in the previous scenes, you realize the gruesome murder was ridiculously out of character. Which, to me, makes the violence gratuitous. It would be a great scene if the story justified it, but without proper motivation, it's becomes shocking for the sake of shocking.<br />And yes, there are parallels drawn between Markus and the Tenia. We're pretty much bludgeoned in the head with them (pun intended). Yes, it's a fine line between being a brute boyfriend and an immoral rapist, but it might be interesting to reveal details about that line instead of blurring it further.<br />I think there are elements of a good movie here. The brutal violence doesn't make it less watchable for me--it's the relatively simple (and awkwardly structured) story, the lack of emotional texture that do that. I just don't see the point. Maybe I'm missing something. But if it's not entertaining, or it doesn't illuminate a dark area of life and show humans struggling to make it better, or SOMETHING redeeming, why make the movie? There doesn't have to be a happy ending. It doesn't have to be generic crap marketed to the masses. But if you're going to spend two hours of your life watching a movie, shouldn't you come away better (or different or changed) for having watched it?
B000001FA4|3.0|&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; is somewhat easy to overlook, falling as it does between &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;War,&quot; two albums of overwhelming power. &quot;Fire&quot; is a bit of a disappointment for me (though still very much worth listening to), not because of the music, but because of the quality of the lyrics.<br />The Edge, Larry and Adam play at their very best. &quot;Pride,&quot; &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Wire&quot; are three of U2's most sensational songs. But for the most part, Bono seems strangely absent in the lyric department. Obviously he wrote the above songs, as well as two other beautiful pieces, &quot;MLK&quot; and &quot;A Sort of Homecoming.&quot; But &quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot;? &quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot;? The title song? I have no idea what to make of them, and that sort of puts a crimp in the album's emotional content.<br />Still, the record contains five tremendous songs, and functions as their vehicle, with the rest of the tunes serving as filler.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|\\"The Straight Story\\" is a true story about a 73 year old man who drove 300 miles on a riding lawnmower to visit his estranged brother who has just had a stroke. Why did he ride a lawnmower? Well, as he tells almost everyone who asks in the movie, his eyesight is bad and he doesn't' have a drivers license. Alvin Straight is opinionated, pigheaded and cantankerous - he is not a particularly intelligent man but when he speaks, his carefully chosen words speak volumes about life. He meets many people along his five-week journey and along the way, he ruminates about mistakes he made in his life, human nature as well as the wisdom and downfalls of old age. Above all, he dispenses common sense, especially to those in need of it.<br />Like Alvin's character, this is a simple film, brilliantly filmed by director David Lynch, but one that will stick with you long after the final credits. Richard Farnsworth received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (he committed suicide one year later after being diagnosed with terminal cancer). Sissy Spacek is, as always, wonderful as Alvin's daughter, a semi-retarded woman who herself lives in the shadow of a devastating secret. But all of the actors in this film are great, even the ones who only have brief scenes. The cinematography is wonderful as well with the camera sweeping across the prairies and plains of the Mid-West.<br />It may come as a surprise that this film was made by David Lynch, the director who has made such unconventional films as \\"Blue Velvet,\\" \\"Naked Lunch,\\" and the tv series \\"Twin Peaks.\\" For those familiar with his work, it may seem unbelievable that this is the same David Lynch, but it shows the true mark of a gifted and versatile filmmaker.
B000001FS6|3.0|&quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; somehow survived 1988, the movie and &quot;The Joshua Tree's&quot; shadow to stand on its own as a massive slab of U2 product -- pulsating (sometimes ominous) bass, chiming guitars, hammering drums and Bono's trademark whisper-wailing.<br />It's a giant mixed bag -- live cuts from the tour (&quot;Silver and Gold,&quot; &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; &quot;Pride,&quot; and &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; are magnificent), studio cuts (&quot;God Part II,&quot; &quot;Love Rescue Me,&quot; &quot;Desire,&quot; and &quot;Heartland&quot; live on, while &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot; and &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; never made it out of the 80s), covers (&quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; both of which are simply OK) and original tunes (&quot;Hawkmoon 289&quot; is extremely underrated).<br />Dark and beautiful, exceptionally well-produced, &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; is not U2 for the masses but for the fan and the collector. It just barely misses greatness; its lack of focus and all-over-the-place approach has charm but no momentum. The movie can't compare, but the album does strangely leave off two excellent tracks from the tour: &quot;With Or Without You&quot; (with Bono throwing in the famous &quot;missing lyric&quot;) and the bone-breaking &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday.&quot; Oh, well, you can't have it all.
B00005JM0B|4.0|T3 has fine performances by Claire Danes (fiery and feisty) and Kristanna Loken (cool and crafty).  Nick Stahl and Arnold Schwarzenegger give performances which are decent, but not as engaging.  <br />I liked the fact that the terminatrix used her sex appeal as an aid in infiltration.  Before seeing the movie, I had thought that a female terminator didn't make much sense (except to get a male audience).  But now I see that the less threatening, and more sexy, a terminator looks, the more able it is to achieve its goals.  Kristanna was every bit as good as Arnold was in the first film.<br />This is no James Cameron film.  The cinematography isn't as engaging (the point-the-camera-at-the-action school), and there are so many special effects that it almost takes away from the story.  The story wins out though, and that, along with the women's performances, saves the film.<br />The film was clearly influenced by The Matrix, particularly in a scene where T1 and TX fight it out, busting through loads of porcelain in a restroom.  Reminded me of Morpheus and that unfortunate toilet bowl.<br />While I doubt the possibility of another sequel, the film leaves room for one, or even a TV series.  Stunt direction is very impressive.  The film keeps moving, and doesn't grow tiresome -- and it has an ending which is indeed consistent with the other films.  If it didn't, then there would be no ugly future for the terminators to have come from!<br />So, while this film isn't as great as the other two, it isn't an insult to its legacy.  It holds up.
B000001E18|5.0|I have always likened U2's music to a rollercoaster ride, and &quot;Zooropa&quot; is one great trip. Recorded in the middle of the groundbreaking ZooTV tour, &quot;Zooropa&quot; is sarcastic and poetic, dark and shimmering, pessimistic and nostalgic, all at the same time. Will it survive the 1990s? I think so, yes -- it's a portrait of a band testing the limits of their own elasticity, as well as the patience of their listeners. Any way you cut it, this album is a treasure, an overlooked masterpiece from a band famous for their masterpieces.<br />The best song here is without question &quot;Lemon,&quot; still one of the most bizarre and alien-sounding tunes I've ever heard. Bono transforms himself for the song, singing entirely in a falsetto that is, to put it mildly, transfixing. The music is beyond description, a strange mixture of guitars and synthesizers and, yes, squeaky rocking chairs -- utterly unlike anything U2 had ever recorded (and probably ever will record). But listen to the lyrics. This is a beautiful song, a swirling mix of painterly colors, sad and giddy at the same time.<br />What else? Try &quot;Some Days Are Better Than Others,&quot; a ringing dance tune that seems to be about Bono's domestic life. The title track, a cynical slap at corporate-controlled media. &quot;Stay,&quot; the gorgeous ballad that still brings a lump to the throat. And &quot;Dirty Day&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; which sum up the theme of the album: searching through the dirt of modern society, looking for something worthwhile to hold onto.<br />The only song that doesn't work for me is still an important part of the U2 catalog, and that is &quot;Numb.&quot; I'm sorry, but the song is an ugly pseudo-rap that doesn't seem to improve with age. But I'm willing to forgive U2 even this excess, thanks mostly to &quot;Lemon,&quot; which almost -- almost! -- renders even &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; obsolete.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Every once in awhile I go the the theater to see a movie that I normally wouldn't see on the big screen (waiting instead for it to come out on dvd) and this was one of those times.  My nephew is a fan of Tim Burton so off we went to see Big Fish.  I had no idea what to expect, so no way to get let down, and I was pleasantly surprised with the show.<br />Basically a feel good, father-son story, this isn't a flick for those looking for action packed fasted paced story.  It is something I'd normally wait to rent and while I recommend seeing it, it's hard to give a strong buy recommendation as the story, once told, is hardly exciting enough to see again.<br />That said, I do recommend this movie, it has a strong message to send about life and love and the relationship between parent/child.  It is about forgiveness and letting go and also about seeing things from another viewpoint.
B000001F3C|4.0|Following the crush of &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; the ZooTV era and &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind,&quot; this album from U2's so-called early period rocks out, proving beyond a doubt that this Irish quartet can out-rock anybody.<br />&quot;War&quot; is stunning. It's got two of the greatest-ever U2 songs (&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; both of which set arenas and concert halls on fire) in their original extended versions, but it also features several underrated songs, like &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; (a rousing tune), &quot;Red Light&quot; (U2 with horns!) and the rocking &quot;Refugee.&quot;<br />The album amazingly does not sound dated, perhaps in part due to the fact U2 continue to perform &quot;SBS&quot; and &quot;NYD.&quot; This is a classic; one of their five best albums, and essential to any U2 library.
B000001FFJ|5.0|It is rare for any lyricist to pen a verse as remarkably specific and thoughtful as \\"Make sure they play my theme song I guess daisies will have to do/Just get me to New Orleans and paint shadows on the pews/Turn the spit on that pig and kick the drum and let me down/Put my clarinet beneath your bed 'til I get back in town/Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair.\\"  Yet Tom Waits belts out such verses with regularity on his epochal \\"Rain Dogs,\\" one of the best releases of the 80s.      Waits functions almost like a sponge for every style of American music of the last century; you can hear within the howling, sepia tones of his roughened voice the distant echoes of blues, jazz, ragtime, folk, country, and old school rock 'n roll.  Yet for all of his homage to roots music, Waits displays a creative cunning and adventurousness that is seldom seen among singer-songwriters.  Take, for example, his adroit use of percussion backdrops--never does he take the easy way out and use a simple drum pattern, opting instead to craft a pulsing rhythmic collage that drifts unsettingly beneath an array of icepick guitar (courtesy of Marc Ribot and, in some places, Keith Richards) and bar-room piano.  Such an approach only hints at Waits' unique genius and his seemless mastery of American music.    It is hard to determine whether Waits' acute lyrics or his soulful, wounded voice merits more praise; the former are so complex and beautiful (\\"And they all pretend they're orphans and their memory's like a train/You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away/And the things you can't remember tell the things you can't forget/That history puts a saint in every dream\\") that they often leave me speechelss, while the latter imbues these words with a grizzled character and the tangible feeling that every scene and every character that escapes from Waits' mouth is just as real and just as colorful as he claims it is.    Named for dogs that lose track of their scent in the wake of arainstorm, \\"Rain Dogs\\" is stained with feelings of broken love and bluesy lament; you can almost see Waits sitting at some street corner in the middle of a gullywasher, strumming a guitar and beating a conga whilst bestowing wisdom and pure poetry.  The blue and somber and tones of this album ebb and flow brilliantly with Waits' more whimsical moments (\\"Uncle Vernon, Uncle Vernon, independent as a hog on ice/He's a big shot down there at the slaughterhouse/Plays accordion for Mr. Weiss\\"), and the result is nothing short of one of the most unique and intricately crafted albums in history.
B000002TQV|4.0|So I'm a little slow to catch on.  I actually bought this CD because I was given another CD, True Love Waits, on which Christopher O'Riley plays Radiohead tunes transcribed for piano.  And somehow a classical pianist hooks me on Radiohead.  I really like this CD and I think Thom the lead singer has a fantastic voice.  High and light and agile, but never whiny or screechy.  Terrific arrangements, and who doesn't want to play the guitar after listening to this CD?  Melodies aren't trite or obvious, but Radiohead never overcomplicates things, allowing them to really rock.  I guess the one thing holding me back from a sparkling review is that the themes of these songs seem a little tired.  GenX depression, fated obsessive love, middle class disillusionment all make me feel like I'm in high school again.  I'm glad I'm not back in high school (but that doesn't mean the lyrics no longer speak to me).  Then again, this is 1995.  I was in high school.  It's my fault for not listening earlier because they could have been my anthem band.  In 1995 I would have given them a golden 5.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|In a time that metal bands are being portrayed as pimple faced kids with spiked hair, black T-shirts, kakhi shorts who pretend to look depressed, the veterans of Maiden come back to show what metal really is about.<br />I liked this album.  As every new Maiden album, it takes me a few listenings to really digest it.  But it doesn't take long to realize that this is good old maiden, that is not looking back, but constantly evolving and sounding very current.<br />I do not regret at all.  Long live Iron Maiden!
0800141806|4.0|I'm not going to lie to y'all -- this movie is really difficult to watch.  It portrays a once vibrant, young lawyer  fight his battle with both AIDS and discrimination.  But, it is a must-see, especially for those who possess fear of AIDS and homosexuality.  It's in your face, but you could possibly learn something the hard way.<br />Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, but I believe that this is his stand out performance.  His portrayal of Andy Beckett is out of this world.  Denzel Washington also really rises to the occassion.<br />I highly recommend this movie to EVERYONE and I think it should be shown at schools, workplaces, etc.  We could ALL learn a lesson from it.<br />The only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is *because* it's so hard to watch.  The lawyer for the defendant will INFURIATE you.  (And that's only a start)<br />For you fellow Indigo Girls fans out there:  listen for the Girls' amazing cover of &quot;I Don't Wanna Talk About It&quot; early on in the film.  ;)
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As I listen to the tracks on my Apple iPod, I'm reminded how well this score is written. The mixture of forcefull-like and rough textures blended with the soothing melodic overtones creates an ambiance like no other soundtrack. I love the other 2 disks from FOTR and TTT but this one tops them. The beautiful melodies &quot;Into the West&quot; and &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; are magnificent. I love how Shore hints of this melody in &quot;The Black Gates Open&quot;.<BR>Most people complained about how long the movie's ending lasted but how do you end an epic movie of this proportion. I think the music carried the film where the visual aspect layed low. Awesome job Howard Shore!
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis is back in fine form with \\"Moneyball.\\" The book explores two themes: the financial inequities of Major League Baseball, which force small-market clubs to take a unique approach to building their teams; and Billy Beane's passionate and idiosyncratic leadership of the 2002 Oakland A's, a low-budget success story with very few equals. Baseball fans will certainly enjoy the insider's perspective of the A's organization (e.g., why Hatteburg and Mabry were added to the team, why Art Howe was dumped). And non-fans should appreciate Lewis's folksy descriptions of the great American pastime, including both on-the-field and off-the-field anecdotes. My only quibble with \\"Moneyball\\" is that the book could benefit from an index, to help readers find references to important characters associated with the team. But that's just window dressing. There's plenty of meat to this well written story, proving that Michael Lewis, despite a couple of recent clunkers, hasn't lost his touch.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a small film, without the slick styling of many bigger budget 'Hollywood' productions (no disrespect intended!), but if you let it, the delightful characters will draw you in. It is a slow-moving and some would say somewhat predictable story of self-discovery (though one set in an unusual cultural environ for most) but it's an absolute joy to follow the lead character on her journey none-the-less. Given the outstanding quality of her acting, there's no question you will be emotionally moved (probably to tears) before the end. Highly recommended.
B000002UAU|5.0|do what they did, smoke a joint and listen to this, it'll blow your mind.....but if thats not your thing this is still arguably the BEST record ever made.  I own it on LP and CD and listen to both about twice a month.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|A very good cd that pretty much every song is good.
B00000I78Y|4.0|then you will like this, but yes some of their views will DRASTICALLY differ from yours, and you must listen to the whole song and understand it before you start skipping around the songs trying to find something that appeals to you.  I do like them and thing it is pretty good.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This Cd rules and always will and i would like to see anyone try to imitate them because these guys are so unique and the bomb and did i mention that they Rock &amp; Rule 24-7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000092ZYX|1.0|I was highly disappointed by this album. I do not understand why Radiohead is seen as such an amazing, groundbreaking band. <BR>The only thieves I see here are Thom Yorke and co. They started off as imitators of grunge (remember \\"Creep?\\") and now are imitating Aphex Twin -- from five years ago.<BR>You can like them if you like, but this is only innovating because MTV2 wants you to think so.<BR>Just buy \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"The Bends,\\" it is all the Radiohead you'll ever need.
0743442539|3.0|I found this to be a slightly entertaining spy novel; I don't think it is anywhere close to justifying the superlative reviews that have been ladled on it, both on this website and by others. After reading Ian Fleming's Bond novels (and perhaps I was spoiled by Fleming) I was extremely hopeful for this book, ostensibly the &quot;finest&quot; spy novel ever written. <br />One of the more exciting aspects of the book is when the main character is spirited into East Germany, and meets increasingly interesting and intellectual interrogators. The exciting middle makes up, in part, for the slightly silly beginning and melodramatic conclusion.<br />The main romance was a bit difficult to believe, and the plot was somewhat formulaic, but I suppose it isn't too bad. Anyway, even if I'm the only person in the world who doesn't love it, and my review is entirely offbase, I figure that your slightly diminished expectations will be exceeded even farther by the book, and you will be more delighted because of my lukewarm review. If you do buy this book, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.
B00004XONN|1.0|This album reminds me of college; being snowed in at someones dormroom and their annoying roommate breaks out there casio keyboard because ther is nowhere to go and nothing to do and you are all out of cheap beer and wine and nothing to eat but microwavible popcorn.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|The dvd is fantastic - go buy it now.<br />I usually don't buy DVDs of bands playing live, but after much deliberation I decided to splurge - hoping that it would at least be as good as the concert I watched them play last year at MSG.<br />The band is awesome at Slane.  Their chemsity is evident from start through finish and it permeates the crowd as well as the viewer.  Each one of the Peppers is amazing to watch but, as most reviews have pointed out, John F. is just mezmerizing.<br />As fantastic as the whole DVD is, the most amazing part of the show is when they play the intro to Fugazi's &quot;Latest Disgrace&quot;.  I've read no reference to it in the other reviews but watching RHCP play that (so amazingly well!) was unexpected and breathtaking.
B000002MJ0|5.0|Let me start by saying my bloody Valentine is my favorite band ever, and this is my favorite album of thiers. I am tired of people comparing \\"Isn't Anything\\" to \\"Loveless.\\" I think the band was in two totally different eras of the bands existence and they each have two very different things to say.  One cannot argue the brilliance of \\"Loveless,\\" which after one listen made me throw out all of my REM tapes. Loveless might have been the album that along with Pavement's \\"Slanted and Enchanted\\" and Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" changed the musical landscape forever. It is still being imitated and applaudeded by everyone from Billy Corrigan to the guy from Phish as well as many others.    The reason why I would choose \\"Isn't Anything\\" over \\"Loveless\\" is that it sounds more like a band album rather than a Kevin Shields album. Debbie's bass playing has never been stronger or more creative -- just listen to the openning bass riff! Colm is simply amazing, picking up where Keith Moon left off. Bilinda and Kevin are amazing, both on guitar and the interplay between their vocal harmonies. It is tight and focused and so innovative that it started a musical movement --(shoegazer or dream pop, depending on which side of the Atlantic yr on).   Along with Sonic Youth's \\"Daydream Nation,\\" 'Isn't Anything\\" brought attention to the fact that a new breed of guitarist was emerging, that something wonderful was about the happen and about to turn the music industry on its ear. Buy it today.
B0000931OG|5.0|And to think, I almost dismissed this album.  Heck, this being my second Blur album (yes, I'm so far behind the times, I can barely see straight), I was ready to dismiss them altogether.  On first listen, \\"Ambulance\\" sounded dissonant and illogically-rooted, with no discernable melody whatsoever.  \\"Crazy Beat\\" was a bland attempt at gettin' some rockin' on this record, wasn't it?  And \\"Jets\\" is overlong and masturbatory, right?  Yet, I found I couldn't stop listening to this record.  It continued to call me, beckoning me to play it... and finally, I had the answers to all my proposed questions.<br />No, \\"Ambulance\\" is a brilliant, confident opener of floating proportions.  \\"Crazy Beat\\" is far from bland, a \\"holy crap!  Let's go all-out!\\" in the middle of a rather subdued record.  And \\"Jets,\\" though certainly loopy and near-tiring, is perhaps one of the greatest jazz compositions in recent memory (and on a Blur album to boot).  This was the album I had never properly discovered, and I was now discovering it, feeling amongst each of its rhythms for a sense of meaning, for I was to surely \\"disappear\\" amongst the folds of Damon Albarn's voice and Alex James's funk-defying bass lines.<br />And if \\"Out of Time\\" were any more beautiful, it'd be illegal.  It truly \\"flows,\\" a masterpiece of BOTH sound and melody, which is certainly a hard thing to create.  \\"Good Song\\" eats the space between your ears with equal, but perhaps more longing, beauty, reverberating and repeating until your concscious mind is gone and all that is left is the music and you.  \\"Caravan\\" may seem drab and boring and whatnot at first, but when those keyboards kick in halfway through... you'd better watch out, or you'll find your soul immersed in love.  \\"We've Got a File on You\\" makes my tongue salivate in happiness, just to be cancelled out by the relentless groove of \\"Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club,\\" cause \\"SURELY WE WILL DISAPPEAR.\\"<br />And it all leads up to one of the greatest social distortions to ever reach my ears, \\"Battery in Your Leg.\\"  It seems a normal piano ballad at first.  Of course, this is only a temporary feeling, as Albarn's third verse is accompanied with an onslaught of Coxon's bffermffflequaa (my personal name for it) guitar sound.  If you're not careful (as in, if your mind wanders at all while listening to this song), your head will certainly explode.<br />And in the end, that's exactly what Think Tank is: a head-exploder.  A mind-blower.  And a beautiful reflection of something you've never seen, someplace you've never been, a somehow you've never questioned.  A beauty, everpresent and everlonging for ears, whether disconcerned or intrigued.  This is the essence.  This is the album of the year.
B00006BTCA|3.0|My friend calls them &quot;InterSmithsDivision.&quot; I think he's right. <BR>There is nothing new here, but it is good rehashed New Wave and much better than the Strokes. I do like the fact that Interpol have no qualms about being original either and at least they do have a good taste in influences.<BR> If you play this album while playing with a Ouija board, Ian Curtis's ghost just might pop up and say, &quot;hello, please turn that down.&quot;
B000089RVR|1.0|I must admit that I love Dido's voice. It is elegant and pretty and her British accent sounds very sweet and naive, but besides that, I honestly hate this album.<br />At first, I'll admit, I really liked it. It had the catchy beats of &quot;No Angel&quot;, but it got old really, really fast. Within 3 or 4 days of buying it, I gave it -- yes, GAVE it -- away to my best friend. <br />The reasons? It's all the same! Dido has done nothing new, she could've called this album &quot;No Angel For Sale (Again)&quot; instead of &quot;Life For Rent.&quot; The songs, &quot;See You When You're 40&quot;, &quot;Stoned&quot;, &quot;See the Sun&quot;, and all the others, are very FLAT&gt; What I mean is (UNLIKE songs like &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;All You Want&quot; from &quot;No Angel&quot;) the song's plot doesn't build, Dido has the same emotion and keeps explaining the same old points about the cliche situation throughout the whole song. No excitement, no tension. You can predict how the song will turn out from the first word to the last, simply because you've heard it all before in every other mainstream song out there. <br />PLUS, it sounds like Dido has NO VOCAL RANGE, which isn't true, because she sang quite high AND low on &quot;No Angel&quot;. The songs all seem to be sung in the same 3, middle-of-the-staff notes. It gets dreadfully tiring and makes me sleepy.<br />My advice? If you love Dido's voice, get &quot;No Angel&quot;. The sound isn't much different from this album, but the lyrics are more interesting and the songs are stories that have a beginning, a middle, and -- more often than not! -- a surprise ending.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Boasting an all-star cast, killer soundtrack, an amazing DVD, Daredevil truly delivers on all cylinders here.<br />Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a man who was blinded in an accident as a child, and because of this incident, his other senses adapted and grew stronger than sight. By day, he is a lawyer in a business with college friend Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau); by night, he is a vigilante seeking justice through any means--the Man Without Fear, Daredevil. Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is a reporter who is seeking the scoop on Daredevil, and believes he is not just a New York urban legend, but a true vigilante. Matt's life changes when Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner, the hottest actress on Earth), steps into his life, becoming Matt's girlfriend. Unfortunately, Elektra's father has just stepped out of connections with the crimelord Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), and Kingpin hires an Irish assassin with perfect aim, Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill Mr. Natchios. This all leads to chaos, and when things go awry Matt and Elektra must seek justice in their own ways, against the evil Bullseye and Kingpin.<br />Bringing to life another of Stan Lee's fantastic Marvel Comics creations, Daredevil is an amazing movie with a good score by Graeme Ravell (The Negotiator) and soundtrack with such bands as Fuel, Drowning Pool featuring Rob Zombie, and Evanescence (this movie really got them off the ground). <br />The only thing I have to fret is casting Duncan as the Kingpin. Nothing against Mr. Duncan or black people, but the Kingpin is a huge, hulking Caucasian man, fat, not muscular. They should've kept it that way. But I thought he played the part given to perfection. Garner, of Alias fame, is also amazing as Elektra and may be one of the best parts of the movie alone.<br />The action scenes are also tremendous, and the &quot;radar&quot; Daredevil possesses is greatly brought to screen.<br />The impressive 2-disc DVD collection brings the picture quality in 2.35:1, and audiosoundtracks in Dolby Digital 5.1 &amp; DTS 5.1, both amazing soundtracks. With plenty of bonus features to keep a comic book geek like me busy, this film truly delivers and is worth a buy.

B00005JMGC|4.0|It is the year 1953: The aftermath of the Korean War meant that a newfound idealism of communism was reigning supreme on the northern part of the Korean peninsula, cigarette advertisements were being aired on television [can you believe that?], and thousands of women across this great country were tied down to a life of drudgerous housework, having to do menial chores for their husbands, who brought home the bacon (in the form of a paycheck), leaving these wives no choice but to cook it. These same women could only fantasize about life as career women and provide substantial earnings of their own. That would bring about much needed changes, in the form of one Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who would arrive at one of the nation's premiere institutions of higher learning for women: Wellesley College. Ms. Watson would make the long, arduous journey from sunny California to icy Massachusetts, only to find that she has a tough task ahead of her, having to face a tough crowd of young, free-spirited female college students, who test our Professor of Art History upon arrival, fresh off the train from the West Coast. Ms. Watson's attempt at instilling ideals of reforming the girls' vision of the modern-day role of women in 1950s society falls on deaf ears, and, therefore thinking that women are continued to be destined to live a glorious life as domestic engineers, wallowing in the aromatic stench of Bon Ami and Brillo pads, Ms. Watson's students go about their lives on campus, concentrating on gossip concerning the girls' love life and their future husbands. Using various forms of art history through different types of paintings and ancient sculptures, including other forms of television and magazine advertisements, Ms. Watson challenges her students through means of theoretical concepts, to examine both the past and future roles of women in society, both as housewives and as potential career  women. When the girls use their minds to examine such possibilities (and probabilities), surprising results are bound to occur (which makes Helen Reddy's \\"I Am Woman\\" seem like only a novel model of feminist pride by comparison). Leaving her exceptionally bright and independent class to handle this concept on their own, as well as under Ms. Watson's terms, Watson's in-depth curiosity and skin-deep beauty catches the eye of a Professor of Foreign Languages, who has a lot more on his mind than Italian cuisine and the canals of Venice. Also, Ms. Watson's love life isn't exactly peaches and cream back home, as her fiancee pays a surprise visit to New England (Gee, heads are about to REALLY roll now!). In \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\", it is with these types of dramatic roles where Ms. Roberts is most adept and at home, adding her own unique brand of thespian wit and charm to the role of Katherine Watson, everybody's favorite instructor of art history (OK, maybe not!). Could another Oscar for Best Actress be in the offing for Julia? To further her quest in this beneficial and glorious cause, it would be most wise to journey to your local theater, and take in a viewing of \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\"; when, upon seeing it, will make the upward corners of your mouth do an unbelievable double-take, making the lips of Da Vinci's female subject seem like an act of (pent-up) rage and hostility by comparison (to which I state in great, good-natured humor of course!)!robabilities), surprising results are bound to occur (which makes Helen Reddy's \\"I Am Woman\\" seem like only a novel model of feminist pride by comparison).

0974153001|5.0|This book is everything I had been looking for regarding smaller scale full body sculpts. Katherine Dewey so precisely outlines each step, it is incredible! Not a book for a total polymer clay novice, but on the other hand, it is not confusing and difficult to follow like other books I have bought before. She presents the instructions so clearly, and does'nt leave out anything! This is a book that I will cherish for years to come. You will not be disappointed if you are interested in creating realistic figures!
B00006F83Y|5.0|QOTSA is a great refreshing, no holds barred kind of band that is heavily needed in a time of bland or &quot;shoot me please lord&quot; bands. The band is centered around Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri, who also help formed one of the greatest bands I am sure none of you have heard of, Kyuss. For those of you who do know of Kyuss, I don't have to rant to you the sheer genius of their 2nd Album, Blues For The Red Sun. For those of you who haven't heard it, GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!! Back to the Queens, one word to desribe their music, Originality. Something which lacks in this MTV age. Many cannot appreciate these albums. Which is Sad. And the other Sad part is Mike from WA who is stoked that Dave Grohl is &quot;their Drummer&quot;. Well Mike, He isn't. The Queens are Basically Josh and Nick. All others are generally showing apperances. Which goes to show what an impact these two have had on the music world since Kyuss' inception. I hope these two don't sober up and keep producing fresh tunes.
B000002UDB|4.0|Magical Mystery Tour is a rather fine Beatles album that has been unfortunately overlooked by many at the expense of some of their more well-known, but actually lower-quality, albums. There are several popular explanations for this. The first six songs on the album were commissioned as the soundtrack for the British made-for-television movie of the same name as the album; the tracks were released as two separate EPs. The film was, by all accounts, such a disaster and an embarrassment that it never even saw release in the U.S. When it came time to release those six songs, however, it was judged that a full LP would be better-suited for the American market; consequently, six brilliant and ground-breaking singles were added to the original six tracks to make this album. Subsequent world-wide CD releases have stuck with this track listing. Being a hodgepodge, this album lacks the thematic flow of Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road; also, since the singles are so diverse, it is an even more eclectic disc than the White Album. This makes for a somewhat jarring, not quite smooth listen -- but many of the songs included are unquestionably brilliant. This is an album that is, perhaps, less than the sum of its parts -- but what parts it has! Probably the negative response to the film tainted the album somewhat, and has contributed to its being overlooked -- ditto for its hodgepodge nature, which was decried by many critics upon release as shameless product (some of the singles on it being nearly a year old.) Coming between two monoliths -- Sgt. Pepper and the White Album -- couldn't have helped, either. Time has helped to heal these wounds, and today we can judge this album on its own merits, quite removed from its contemporary window dressing.<br />The album is very psychedelic in nature, even moreso than Sgt. Pepper. Some of the weirdest music the band ever did is here -- also, some of the best. Fool On The Hill and Hello Goodbye are classic psychedelic pop tracks that still charmtoday. I Am The Walrus is a much-loved Beatles track with very odd lyrics but innovative and compelling music -- and it's even catchy! Flying is nothing less than a Beatles instrumental -- well, there are no words, anyway -- driven by Paul's rumbling bass and some keyboard flourishes; it is quite psychedelic. Baby You're A Rich Man is another weird single that also manages to please. All You Need Is Love is a classic song with a great orchestral accompaniment. But, of course, the twin peaks of the album are the inclusion of the double A-side single Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane. The latter was one of the most innovative singles of the 1960's; the first song to use synthesizer technology, it is a true technical and emotional masterpiece that features, perhaps, the best vocal John Lennon ever cut for The Beatles. Its companion, Penny Lane, is its near equal -- an ambitious pop masterpiece as melodic and catchy now as the day it was released. The album is almost worth getting just for these songs:  they can't be found anywhere else, outside of compilations.<br />To be sure, the album has some clunkers. The title track is a throwaway trifle. George Harrison's lone contribution, Blue Jay Way, is a psychedelic misstep. Your Mother Should Know is catchy, but ultimately pointless. Still, the album has more than a handful of great tracks all collected here in one convenient place. If one loves The Beatles -- and can ignore one of the worst album covers of all-time -- then this is an essential purchase.

0446678430|5.0|This is the novel that did it for me.  It is the third novel of Robert T. Kiyosaki's that I have read.  I also have read Rich Dad Poor Dad, and Cashflow Quadrant.  The first two books were exciting to read, the information in them is priceless.  But this is the book where I finally realized the power of what I think.  There is one particular line that I remember especially, First identify what I am afraid of, then ask myself what I want instead, then ask myself how to get it.  As he says repeatedly, it is not the content that matters as much as the context.  I don't know if I really understand all the stuff about leverage.  But what is more important than that, is that I limit me.  My thoughts limit what I do, and they also allow me to retire young and rich.  I don't know how someone can't like these books unless they are a cynic, arrogant, or lazy.  I encourage you to buy this book and read it.  And then read it again like I am going to do.
B00009ATIX|2.0|SOLARIS isn't like most sci-fi adventures. In fact, it isn't like most movies of any kind. It begins with psychologist Chris Kelvin being sent to the space station orbitting the planet Solaris in a last-ditch effort to re-establish contact. When he gets there he finds the remnants of the crew haunted by some strange phenomena. They are playing host to some uninvited \\"visitors\\". In due course, Kelvin gets a visitor of his own, in the form of his dead wife.<br />The hows, whys and wherefors of this situation could have made for a pretty interesting and intense tale. There are some intense and emotional moments as Kelvin tries to grapple with the situation and his own personal baggage, and the acting is generally good, too. As one character comments, however, \\"there are no answers, only questions\\". That's an accurate summation of SOLARIS. It raises lots of questions in the viewers mind, but never answers any of them. Instead, after providing almost no action and deadening viewer's senses with ponderous visual interludes accompanied only by station background noise, the story concludes without any real resolution and without any explanation of what was going on.<br />SOLARIS has its plusses, but it isn't a movie most people will enjoy watching. Fortunately, I got my copy essentially free. It came packaged with a movie that I definitely wanted and at the price of a single DVD. Don't spend your money on this unless you've seen it and are sure you want it.
B000127LW2|1.0|Fans of \\"Voyager\\" must have spent the years of the Original Series, \\"Next Generation,\\" and \\"Deep Space 9\\" living in a cave. \\"Voyager\\"'s consistently miserable writing, mediocre effects, miserable writing, uninteresting/poorly developed characters, and miserable writing ruined the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise for good. No wonder \\"Nemesis\\" and \\"Enterprise\\" fared so poorly!<br />Paramount could give me these DVDs for free and I still wouldn't want them.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|This is a must have for Rush enthusiasts, but only because it is the only concert DVD Rush has put out.  I love Rush's music, I like the song selection, and I thoroughly enjoyed the concert, (though it was not as good as the &quot;Test for Echo&quot; concert).  I even liked the crowd ... for about the first 30 seconds, but the constant drone of the crowd for three bloody hours is too much.  <br />Now, I can appreciate the crowd's enthusiasm of seeing Rush for the first time in Brazil, and I'm happy to see that there are so many fans there, but perhaps Rush could do the connoisseurs in their audience a favor and record a DVD at a venue with a mature audience, for example, the Gorge at George in Washington State.  This way fans everywhere can enjoy the concert (not to mention the awesome scenery) over and over again in the comfort of their own living room for many years to come.<br />Beyond the crowd, the musical sound quality is rather muddy and the camera switches are enough to put an epileptic into grand mal seizures.  The video editor may think he's an artist, but he's really just inexperienced.  After my first time out with a video camera, I learned that a constantly moving or quickly changing picture is tedious to watch.<br />The DVD gets at least 2 stars just because it's Rush, but I gave it a 3, because I liked the Documentary &quot;The Boys in Brazil&quot; and the MX Multiangle recordings of YYZ and La Villa Strangiato.  It's sad that the best part of a concert DVD is the extra features, isn't it:(

0142000663|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a compelling novel dealing with the many hardships the Joad family undergoes while struggling to survive during the depression.  John Steinbeck takes the readers on an emotional roller coaster as each chapter introduces new twists and turns hooking the reader and bringing them in.  Throughout their endeavors the characters seem to transform and take on new roles; whether it be a desperate man trying to forget the past, live in the present and move into the future, a hopeless reverend striving to find meaning and holiness in life or a husband coping with failure and the fact that he cannot support let alone take care of his family without the strength and guidance of his wife.  The Grapes of wrath focuses on family ties and humanities need of relationships and companionship.<br /> The novel is centered around one of the themes concentrated on this semester; the person's fear of loneliness as well as inability to be content with solitude and constant need of interaction and new relationships with that of other persons.  This theme is very evident throughout the novel from the very beginning with the quickly evolving comradeship of Tom Joad and \\"Reverend\\" Jim Casey.  The men find each other in the desolate and barren environment, which at one point had been a thriving community.  Each man is in search of something; for Tom it is his home and family that he has been away from for four years and in Casey's case he is on a spiritual endeavor in the hope of finding holiness and renewing his faith.  The two men find comfort and consolation with their camaraderie.  The theme repeatedly presents itself in various situations for instance: the relationship the Joad's family forms with the Wilson's while venturing to California in hope of a promising new beginning, the effort of uniting the migrant workers against the intolerable working conditions they are forced to cope with initiated by Casey and finished by Tom Joad, and the last scene in the book in which Rose of Sharon saves the life of a man starving to death with her own breast milk.  The Grapes of Wrath is an incredible as well as realistic tale of the ability to mend a desperate soul with the love and solidarity of another.ch Rose of Sharon saves the life of a man starving to death with her own breast milk.

B000003TA4|5.0|I THINK &quot;NEVERMIND&quot; IS AN AWSOME CD! ITS PROBABLY NIRVANA'S BEST CD. IF YOUR INTO ROCK OR HAVE HEARD SOME OTHER NIRVANA SONGS AND LIKED THEM I THINK YOU SHOULD DEFINATLY BUY THIS CD. TRUST ME, YOU WONT REGRET IT. YOU SHOULD ALSO BUY THE &quot;NIRVANA&quot; CD AND THE &quot;IN UTERO&quot; CD, THERE BOTH REALLY GOOD. AND IF YOUR REALLY INTO NIRVANA THE &quot;HEAVIER THAN HEAVEN&quot; BIOGRAPHY ON KURT COBAIN IS ALSO A REALLY GOOD BOOK. OK THATS ABOUT ALL FROM ME.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Let me tell you a little about how I got into Coldplay. At first, I didn't know who they were, but I highly enjoyed their videoclip &quot;The Scientist&quot;, it was awesome, and the song was great too... So I decided to give them a try by purchasing &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; CD. And this seemed to me, beyond doubt, one of the greatest albums in 2003. So I was, suddently, a fan of this band, loving their songs and their attidude for the world's problems. So perfect, music for our souls, really. So when I had the opportunity to see them live in DVD, I immediately bought this &quot;Coldplay Live 2003&quot; CD/DVD.<BR>What to say about them live? The whole band is awesome, and their shows are very different, between guitars and pianos, rock and classical. And you can see and listen it all on DVD and CD. The songs are the same in both the CD and the DVD, but there are less songs in the CD. The sound in the DVD is awesome (much like the songs incluided in it), and you can choose between 5.1 and 2.0, if you don't own a Home Theater (don't worry, I've tested both and they're both very fine)... One of the greatest features in DVD (and a very funny one too), besides the concert itself, is a Tour Diary, which must be watched. Lots of backstage and live footage, so you can see who these guys really are, while they travel worldwide... But I won't tell you everything you'll find in this DVD, I'll let you have some surprises (who include the awesome animated menus and some little extras). I just say: buy it, it's totally worth your money... Listen the old songs again and discover some new ones, maybe. I, as a new fan (who will now buy Parachutes), discovered new songs I've never listened too, like the divine &quot;See You Soon&quot; and &quot;Shiver&quot;... Well, go check this piece of art by yourselves.<BR>But, no, nothing's perfect. I miss two things in &quot;Coldplay Live 2003&quot;. One of them is the song &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, my favorite one from &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot; CD; and I also miss the lyrics all captioned in the concert. I know the lyrics are avaliable as an extra, but I'd be much better if we could read them while we were watching the fantastic concert. But that's nothing to take the five stars away from this CD/DVD. Some complain because the songs are the same in the CD and the DVD, but I don't bother, since the DVD is only for my Home Theater, and I can take Coldplay in CD anywhere I want...<BR>Buy it and feel Coldplay get deeper and deeper into your soul, if you let it flow.
0385504209|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. You will see a few one star reviews, however anytime anything is popular, and someone is dissapointed by it, they will lash out without appropriate thought or conduct. The sotry is well thought out and well written. The ending however is a little bit loose and left me feeling slightly dissapointed. I would have given this book a perfect rating if the ending had been as tight as the rest of the story, however the intrigue and mystery of the book is done a disservice by it's anti-climatic ending.
0425173895|5.0|Having been gripped for two days by THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, I can say that it is a superbly written novel.  It certainly is ingenious the way Agatha Christie conceals the identity of the murderer from the reader until the final chapters.  The last chapter of all is chilling.  As a narrative and as a mind-puzzle, THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD is a great detective story...possibly one of the greatest ever written.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Alien series and was greatly anticipating this set.  I've viewed most of the disks, and of the ones that played for me, I was greatly impressed.  The content seems unsurpassed. HOWEVER, I went through two sets with Amazon and had to return both due to scratches on the disks and disks that would not play (even without scratches).  I have one of the latest state-of-the-art DVD players, so it can't be my machine.  <BR>Even if the unscratched disks played normally, there is still the major issue of badly scratched disks and a digi pak liner that pops out and is sharp enough to badly scratch disks if they are not carefully replaced.  I am either waiting the inevitable &quot;fix&quot; that will come to this set, or may buy the disks individually.  I realize many people are getting good sets, but my luck brought me two scratched ones.  Buy at your own risk!
0156027321|5.0|I'm a college student at Boston College, and I boast not, but I've read massively and variously. I am also Hindu from Nepal, but not really locked into one religion, as I find so much good in all. I was told about this book by a good friend of mine, and started into it around 6 pm. Two and a half hour later, I emerged with not only a good and enjoyable sense of the book, but deeper understanding into myself and the things and people around me. The concise definition of Hinduism is one of the best I've ever read, and Martel shows a deep knowledge of the culture in that area, as well as the food. The author most likely wrote the story as an allegory, very akin to William Golding in Lord of the Flies among others, and it's phenomenal to say the least. This book takes a good knowledge of working with animals, rudimentary survival skills, a great understanding of nature and a spellbinding story to show you one of the best reads in years.<br />I highly recommend this book, not for the average schmoe, but for someone who is interested in looking for Truth. There is much here in The Life of Pi.
0385512104|2.0|The first 150 pages of this book where great.  The story was interesting, smart and funny.  The last 100 pages went downhill for me.  It seemed to drag from that point forward - you didn't learn any new about the main character and it seemed to get lost in the details of science and math.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Thought the weakest entry in \\"The Matrix\\" Triology, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is still a highly-entertaining film with great action and a mediocre story.<BR>The plot finds Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and the Zionites still fighting a never-ending battle against the Machines. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) still wears that infamous smirk, and the Oracle (Mary Alice replacing the late Gloria Foster) still chain-smokes and bakes cookies.<BR>Despite all its superbly-choreographed fight scenes and mind-blowing computer graphics, \\"Revolutions\\" fails in its way of telling the story. The biggest problem I had with was its climax. It really should've ended with Neo defeating the Machines and Agent Smith(s) at the same time. That \\"treaty\\" crap made me frown. Trinity's death was somewhat laughable. Hugo Weaving's acting (while excellent in the first two installments) was pathetically whiny.<BR>Still, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is a worthy film. It's entertaining. It'll keep your blood pumping. Even if the ending was a major letdown. Maybe the filmmakers denied considering a sequel, you know they're gonna do it--I believe.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Opeth is a group that I would never have expected to enjoy, and definitly not as much as I do now.  The whole death/thrash/metal thing is a big turn off, but I heard I would like the if I liked Porcupine Tree, which I do so I thought I would give it a shot.  <br />They have a way with music.  It's very well structured on this disc.  You have to listen to the whole disc through if you want to get the full feel of it.  It's a story and that's one of the greatest things I think Opeth has done even if it is a sad story.  To have an ongoing story through the whole cd is great.  The opener, the Moor, is incredible.  After many listens it will still remain new.  The same goes for the other songs as well.  This doesn't happen with badly structred music.<br />There was a sticker on the copy I bought that said this cd was for real music lovers and i have to say it really is.  Even if you don't like &quot;death&quot; metal and would rather listen to the Flaming Lips and Nick Cave you should still try this cd, it's a true masterpiece.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento, this movie is unique. You think that this movie would go in events from beginning to end.  But this movie is different. It goes from the end to the beginning, but is that really possible? Is there a plot that can really support that? Well as a matter a fact there is, this movie can actually have that and also let the end (beginning really if you think about it) have a wicked twist. Now I might be confusing you but be confused no more because now let me explain the plot.<br />Memento is about Leonard, he suffers from short term memory loss. Leonard remembers everything up to his wifes murder. Leonard also was attacked during his wife murder (thus the memory loss) He cannot create new memories. So now he is trying to have his revenge with the killer. But how can he accomplish that with his condition? Well...<br />Leonard is very organized, he can take notes and take pictures so he can remember who is who. He takes pictures of all of his contacts. As he goes through his quest he is getting closer and closer he also gets tricked, people can take advantage of someone who wont remember you. He meets a bad cop named Teddy who helps him meet his murder and a bar maid named Natilie.<br />This movie is very suspenseful, this should not be watched by anyone younger than 15, because this movie is very graphic. Be careful when you watch this because some parts are boring. Have fun...
B00009Y2K9|5.0|The music from this CD is like magic. The record, which takes mostly Cuban ballads, and whispers them, gruffly, balances the classicism of Valdes' piano with the wavering voice of Cigala.<BR>The reviewer from Miami is an ignoramus, who should learn to write proper English first, before making pedantic commentaries.  What is to be expected from someone who uses this artistic forum to make cheap political statements?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Definately, this is Britney's best cd.  Almost all of the songs are catchy.  The only one I don't like that much is &quot;Early Morning&quot;, but the rest are truly great.  The ballads, for once, are excellent.  She shows a lot of emotion on &quot;Everytime&quot;.  I recommend to buy this cd.  You won't be dissapointed.  I can't wait for her record company to release a cd with b-sides.  I've heard some are pretty good.
0679720200|5.0|Camus' own summary on the book lies in this phrase \\"...J'ai rsum L'tranger, il y a longtemps, par une phrase dont je reconnais qu'elle est trs paradoxale : 'Dans notre socite tout homme qui ne pleure pas  l'enterrement de sa mre risque d'tre condamn  mort.\\". Translated this means that in our society all men who do not cry at their mother's funeral risk to be condemned to death. Of course the death that Camus refers to is not physical death but rather spiritual death. The spiritual death that arrives because of the struggle for idividual survival. Humans are so involved in personal survival that neglect what might be considered important and humane. That is why Camus has said that \\"\\"L'absurde nat de la confrontation de l'appel humain avec le silence draisonnable du monde.\\". The absurd (in this case the actions of Meursault) is a result of the confronation of a human cry with the indifference of the world. The world did not care about Mersault before the murder but it condemns him for it.<BR>The story revolves around this character (Meursault) who at his mother's funeral shows an indifferent attitude. Sitting on one side of the coffin he feels as if he is at a courtroom since all his mother's friends are sitting across from him.  There is no grief that he feels, an attitude that he carries with him throughout his life.  The same picture takes place at the end when he is sitting in front of a jury being judged after he has murdered a man for no apparent reason. He makes no apologies for his behavior because he finds no fault in his behavior. He is the sole judge of his actions and to him they are justified.<BR>One think to consider is that this man is not a hypocrite.  His indifference is evident in all aspects of his life and he never claims to be something that he is not.  He is the product of the society that he lives in, so deep down I think that Camus with this book does not seek to condemn this man but rather the society that produces and promotes these emotions. Many people go through life as hypocrites and in essence they are not better than Meursault. Meursault defined his path based on his own views of morality and proper behavior which can be as correct as the ones of society in general.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|After watching the DVD, I immediately looked to purchase the audio soundtrack.  I was dismayed to find that &quot;Horse to Water&quot; was not included---the reason I give it only four stars. Leaving this track off has got to be one of the worst decisions ever made. Not only is it a great song, the performance is absolutely compelling.  If you can only purchase one-get the DVD which includes this cut.  <BR>Other than this monumental error, the concert itself truly captures the spirit that was George. Hats off to EC and George's family for putting together a moving and lasting tribute.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|First off I must say that &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is a more impressive album than &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;.  A Perfect Circle has managed to take a step forward in making songs that slowly ramp up in intensity and mood.  If you liked &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; than this album is without a doubt a must-buy.  The best songs on &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; are... WEAK AND POWERLESS, THE NOOSE, BLUE, THE OUTSIDER and PET.
0061015725|3.0|Crichton shows us the dangers of nanotechnology in his latest novel.  In this case, a swarm of nanomachines escapes a military sponsored lab and go beserk as they evolve an even greater intelligence.  It's a really fun read, as Crichton novels tend to be, but I can't give this book full marks.  As usual, Crichton falls into his usual patern--a group of scientists or professionals, who by chance are also beautiful supermodels, face the current scientific hot topic, except it has gone terribly out of control.  In the process, half of the members die, and those who survive face an ambiguously happy ending which gives Crichton the option to make a sequel.  This describes about 90% of Crichton's novels, and it describes this one pretty well.<br />Another weak point of this particular novel is that the solution to the problem is presented fairly early in the story, and you have to read through hundreds of pages and witness several pointless deaths before the hero figures it out.  Usually Crichton is good at giving you some twists at the end, but in this book, it plods straight ahead to the ending you expect.<br />In the end, I can't say this is a great book, but it is an entertaining book.  If you have enjoyed Crichton's formulamatic books before, you'll probably enjoy reading this one.  If you got bored to death reading one of his other books, be warned, this is more of the same.
B0000CFW87|4.0|This CD is mostly songs sung in Italian or Spanish with a few in English.  It's great to listen to while reading or doing other things around the house.  Josh's voice is magnificent and clear, just a pleasure to listen to.
0156027321|4.0|This book was recommended by so many friends it became vital that I read it. And just before I reached the end, I figured out why. First of all, it's well written and creative-a story like none other I've read or imagined. But it took me a while to get into it. I set it down again and again. As friends kept asking, \\"did you finish?\\" I felt it more of an assignment than a reading pleasure, and sometimes, readers like me just need an assignment. So, I plowed through.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />In the Life of Pi there is a tremendous amount of detail-some seems excessive-but some paints beautiful portraits and draws such complex and fascinating characters, that I feel it (the book) deserves all the recognition it has received. The author must be applauded on his ability to tell the story with an incredible amount of knowledge-of religions, zoology and the life of a castaway. It's fun to discuss and to hear the opinions of other readers, especially to find out whether or not they delved the meaning(s) (or any meanings) of the young boy's tall tale.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book, and will look into other works by this talented writer.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This cd has been in my cd player for nearly 2 months now and I've come to the conclusion that this is their best album. This is one of those albums that just builds on you the more you listen to it. Everything about this album is amazing. The guitar solos are just rippin and the drums are top notch. I don't know why people are giving this album bad ratings...It's just so amazing. This album is an essential for Dream Theater fans and any metal fan would love this album
B000002BSG|5.0|Jamiroquai, in my opinion, is one of the most underated bands ever. There have been many comparisons made, that Jay K (the lead singer) sounds like a wannabe imitation of Stevie Wonder, but personally, I think that Jamiroquai has one of the most original sounds to have ever come out in music. There music cannot be defined by a genre. They are a mix of funk, soul, r&amp;b, latin, hip hop, acid jazz, and house music. This album in particular &quot;Traveling Without Moving&quot; is one of their best to date, although all of their other albums are consistenly fresh and good. The highlight songs from this album are &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;, &quot;High Times&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;, and &quot;Alright&quot;. Each song is catchy, soulful and very funky! You must check out this group if you enjoy original music by very talented musicians.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|A bit boring in the beginning, a bit bloody in the end. The middle of that journey was the best. But it doesn't really matter, Tony failed eventually. That all did finally consume him, he lost control of himself. Hence, the world is not yours nomore. I'm about to order this dvd now... OKAY (king)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The best testimonial to casting directors is when you hear an actor sing/play a role and you can't imagine anyone else in those shoes.  Idina Menzel (famous for her innovation as Maureen in Rent) and Kristin Chenowith (Tony Award winner for You're A Good Man Charlie Brown) shine in this musical version of the book by Gregory Maguire.  <br />A fascinating and original spin on a familiar story line with characters we have always known--Wicked chronicles the life and times of Elphaba (the first syllables in L. Frank Baum--the author of the Oz Adventures) who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, who becomes Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.  <br />The story begins during a celebration marking the death of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Glinda is there with the revelers who cry \\"No One Mourns the Wicked.\\"  Glinda attempts to offer some perspective to Elphaba's troubled life and we hear her birth and her parents' horror--she's green.  Someone from the celebrants asks Glinda if it's true that she used to be friends with Elphaba--and the story begins.<br />We find out, through a series of fantastic songs, that Galinda and Elphaba were roommates in college at Shizz University.  Galinda, the popular, cheerleader type, is instantly loved by her classmates, while Elphaba, brooding and intelligent, is rejected because she's green.  Eventually, Galinda and Elphaba become friends, but Elphaba has a secret.  She's got magical powers that interest the Wizard.  However, Elphaba also discovers that the Wizard is a fraud.  I will leave the rest for you to discern.  Unfortunately, the songs only tell part of the story.  There are some unanswered questions that can only be resolved by reading the novel, the Book of the Musical, or seeing the show.<br />The songs are singable and the lyrics are brilliant.  Leave it to Stephen Schwartz.  Idina Menzel's voice provides a powerful foundation for the rest of the cast beginning with \\"The Wizard and I\\" and ending with \\"No Good Deed.\\"  \\"For Good\\" is a deeply emotional song that will touch a chord with anyone.  The beautiful harmonies throughout this album also bring goosebumps every time I listen.  Norbert Leo Butz as Fiyero also deserves mention--while only in 2 songs, his rich sound will leave you wishing you heard more of him. <br />If you're a fan of musicals, pick this one up.  It's sure to win some Tonys this year!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|27 songs that were released as a SINGLE either in America or Britain that went to number 1 in either countries charts.Simple,really.So what is this? 27 songs that were great enough to storm up the charts to the coveted number 1 spot,all on one 78 minute cd.
B00005JLEU|4.0|This highly original and very entertaining film swept almost any award there was for animated feature films, including the Oscar and even Berlin Film Festival. (How refreshing, after too nihilistic and erotic &quot;Intimacy&quot;!)<br />With a little discernment, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is suitable for children (although not too young, maybe from 8 years up) and for adults, too -- if they have not their sense of fantasy 'amputated' from their minds. Yes, it's that good!<br />At the beginning, a little bit spoiled girl named Chihiro is moving with her parents to a new place, a new home. She does not seem too enthusiastic about that. But then the three stop their car and looking around, they find a deserted amusement park(?). From then on, a special string of events starts to unfold, and Chihiro -- now named Sen -- is first resented as a representative of human race, but later wins hearts of almost all inhabitants of the weirdly compelling world of various creatures, apparently based on Japanese mythology. In a way, the girl leaves her childhood behind her and becomes a young woman.<br />Combining the improbable with the inevitable, the ancient and the modern, the films contains many societal references and especially in its second half becomes a 'spirited', at times utterly fascinating journey into fantasy (in my native Slovakia it ran under the title &quot;The Way to Fantasy&quot;). <br />I can recommend this film to real movie connoisseurs. Although I liked &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; recently, I liked this one more! Indeed, few films in my adult life have appealed to the &quot;child&quot; in me more than &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.
B0000683DH|5.0|The &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies were all originally released on DVD with only the bare-minimum treatment- the &quot;special features&quot; were theatrical trailers and widescreen options.  This upset me, especially since the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; film- &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;- is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Finally in late 2002, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; was given the treatment it deserved, and was fully loaded with special features.  These further enhanced a film that actually didn't need them too much anyways, because it was so good.<br />&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; is my favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, and is arguably the best film that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise could ever be expected to deliver.  It isn't a perfect film, but I still give it five stars because of how enjoyable it is.  William Shatner- whose acting has never exactly been heralded- gives his best performance here, showing the right amount of leadership, arrogance, and tenderness.  I won't say much about Ricardo Montalban's performace, since it can just be summed up as the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; villain ever.  He hams it up like there's no tomorrow, and he's terrific to watch every step of the way.  The returning &quot;Star Trek&quot; regulars all fit into their roles comfortably.  Director Nicholas Meyer injected some much needed life into the series with this entry, as he added the right amount of humor, action, and emotional bonding.  The ending when a major character dies is surprisingly wrenching, even over 20 years later.  The only part where the film missteps is with Merritt Butrick's performance as David- he's really not very good (he would improve in the next entry).  Other than that, this is one &quot;Star Trek&quot; film that will appeal to all sci-fi fans, not just Trekkies.<br />Ironically, this was easily the cheapest &quot;Star Trek&quot; film made, even when adjusted for inflation.  The special effects do look somewhat dated now, andsome people may object to the film's occasionally hokey tone.  However, I think that this is simply a wonderful viewing experience, and was the peak of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.  If you want to see just how the &quot;Star Trek&quot; magic works on its fans, look no further than &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin is by far the best band in the history of music, and this album reflects everything Led Zeppelin has accomplished in their storied career.  Following the trend they started in Led Zeppelin IV, they again seperated themselves from the blues licks we saw on I, II, and III, in place of more defined rock and roll.  Every guitarist in the world since the seventies has been influenced by Jimmy Page, and Mr. Page tops anything he'd ever done before with the opener, The Song Remains the Same.  The Rain Song is probably one of the most beautiful 8 minutes of music I have ever heard, showing off Page's fliud riffs on accoustic guitar, and an excellent string arrangement by John Paul Jones, the band's unsung hero.  Tracks such as Over the Hills and Far Away, Dancing Days, and The Ocean are solid rock tracks with unforgettable melodies and incredible vocals.  Zeppelin also experiments with new styles, trying out funk in The Crunge, and some reggae in D'yer Ma'ker.  Finally, my favorite track, No Quarter offers a great synth melody (again compliment of bassist John Paul Jones), and Plant's vocals, filled with reverb, are the best ever.  There is nothing not to like about this album.  Everyone should own this CD, no matter what kind of music they listen to.  It's almost surreal how good this album is.  Led Zeppelin's god-like rock has mezmorized us for decades, and if you don't own Houses of the Holy, buy it now, and join the crowd.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I still can't believe that not only did FOX cancel this show, but they actually seemed like they WANTED to kill it.  They banished this show to the Friday evening basement, changed its timeslot three times, presented the episodes out of order and didn't even air the pilot which introduces all of the great characters!<br />This show is far above anything we've seen in science-fiction TV (or regular dramatic TV, for that matter) in decades.  You don't have to be a fan of science-fiction, fantasy, or westerns to love this show.  It's rare to care about characters in science-fiction and fantasy TV shows because there's a certain level of believability that has to be suspended.  But this show has such a great, attractive cast of real humans ( without the usual hackneyed alien makeup!) who speak dialogue so crisp and funny, and who work so well together that you are captivated by them from the start.  <br />I could go on and on about the terrific special effects and the compelling storylines, but all I can really say is get this box set.  DVD (or a movie theater screen) is the presentation this fine show deserved from the start.
B000002LSV|4.0|There may be a few reasons for the fanatic to complain, but for the most part, this is a great collection for casual fans. It includes all the big hits like \\"Gimmie All Your Lovin\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"Tush\\", and \\"La Grange\\", but also has great songs like \\"Rough Boy\\", \\"Give It Up\\", \\"Sleeping bag\\", and \\"Tube Snake Boogie\\". \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" could have been done better, but it's ok, and I wish \\"Legs\\" was the original, because it has a different intro here. Otherwise it's a great 18 track collection, and I'd much rather have this than a \\"Pearl Necklace\\".
0316666343|5.0|I had a hard time putting this one down. This book had my attention from the very first page . I love this book and highly recommend it to any one. It's not everyday you find good reading.
B00005LB9O|5.0|While it was nearly impossible to top their previous album \\"The Man Who,\\" Travis has succeeded on a number of counts to do just that.  It's true that as a whole the album doesn't quite attain the greatness of its predicessor; however, the strength of the album's best songs by-in-large outshines anything Travis has done before.  Just a few of the instant classics here are Sing, Side, Follow the Light, and possibly the best song written by anyone since the Beatles--Flowers in the Window.  With songs so richly beautiful, it's no wonder that the band quickly became a favorite of mine and my family's--buy it and I'm sure they will become one of yours too!
0156027321|1.0|I cannot believe the accolades this book received. I forced myself to finish reading it because it was for my book group. With all the captivating books yet to be read, I am sorry I wasted even a moment reading this one. If I could have given it zero stars I would have.
0671799320|5.0|An extremely comprehensive and educational book covering  a topic that everyone, worldwide, should be familiar with, especially given current events in the Middle East.<br />I loved this book.<br />Basically, this book covers the entire history of the oil industry!  The story begins with  the engineers who found the undistilled rock oils in places like Pennsylvania and ends in 1992 after the Gulf War had ended.  It documents how the industry evolved during that time period, how events such as the introduction of the automobile changed it, and how eventually it came to figure largely in world politics.  The many people whose lives were intimately intertwined in oil are all mentioned: the engineers, the oil company execs, the sheiks, the kings, the presidents and the prime ministers.<br />Fascinating story.<br />I want to see the movie (PBS documentary)!
B000089RVX|4.0|okey i bought ths a long time ago because i loved the album cover and i thought it would be a really cool Gothic Metal album. since i don't watch MTV ever i didn't know this was going to be a cover up for a really bad pop album. anywase the album ended up sucking bad and i wondered why i bought it. so here is my advise to anyone thinking about getting this: if you want REAL Gothic Metal check out bands like Sirenia, Tristania, Gathering, Theatre of Tragedy, or Sins of Thy Beloved. thank you for reading my review.<br />                         1/10
B00009V7T2|4.0|I got into the legendary El Paso outfit At The Drive-In through their (regretfully) last album, Relationship Of Command. To this day I hold up ATDI's swan song as one of the best, most unique records I own. If there is any justice in the world it will one day be acknowledged as being in the same company as OK Computer and other great works of the '90s. Unfortunately, the members of ATDI went their separate ways. The \\"Afro-bearers\\" (vocalist Cedric Bixler and guitarist Omar Rodriguez) departed and formed The Mars Volta, while the rest of the band became Sparta.<br /><br />Sparta's first album, Wiretap Scars, was a fairly average release that rode on the coattails of the former ATDI's image. Basically a watered-down, radio-friendly take on the original, Sparta made a decent effort but it won't make anyone forget about Relationship Of Command or In Casino Out.<br /><br />Which leads us to the topic of this review. The Mars Volta truly is where the talent of ATDI went. They've evolved the sound of their former band into an impressive prog/latino/hardcore/fusion/whatever juggernaut with Deloused In The Comatorium. They've taken the spacier bits, explosive rhythms, and energy that made Relationship Of Command so unique and ran with them, adding to this gravy their own sonic ambitions.<br /><br />Before I proceed further, I wanted to comment on the frequent comparisons of The Mars Volta to Rush. I find them to be extremely misleading. First off, Cedric Bixler's vocal timbres on this album are more akin to, say, Robert Plant, than the nasal annoyance of Geddy Lee. Moreover, the sound is way more percussive and rhythmic, with John Theodore's drums and percussion taking center stage (and well they should; his drumming kicks arse). Finally, even with the layered synthesizers, dense studio production, ample musical chops, and progressive song lengths Mars Volta never come off as cold and calculated (very unlike Rush). There are gobs of emotion conveyed within the dissonant, jazzy polyrhythmic assault and Cedric's brilliant wails--songs like the disturbing, sad Televators make this point clear. Put more simply, I strongly dislike Rush; if this band actually SOUNDED like Rush, I wouldn't dig this album to the extent I do. It would be collecting dust in a \\"Used CDs\\" bin in an FYE somewhere. But I digress.<br /><br />Totally irrelevant comparisons aside, this is a REALLY impressive release. Deloused In The Comatorium, according to Omar Rodriguez, is a concept album based on the life of close friend Julio Venegas, though the lyrics are mostly quite bizarre, stream-of-consciousness stuff that sound like Omar was having a lot of fun with a thesaurus. Sure, it's pretentious, and the lyrics are probably the weakest point to the album but this can be forgiven. After all, lines like \\"Exoskeletal junction on the railroad delayed\\" lend themselves to all sorts of interesting intepretation. Thinking is good.<br /><br />Moving on to the actual music, there is precious little I'd call \\"filler\\" on this album (barring of course that 6 minutes of synthesizer noodling on Cicatriz ESP). From prog spaciness to latin-flavored percussion breaks to blindingly fast and complicated instrumental passages that would give Dream Theater or King Crimson a run for their money, there is lots of quality music to chew on here. Cedric Bixler is the highlight--he really gives a performance for the ages. Flea, bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, contributes his talents to this album and while he isn't given many chances to show off, his ability to keep up with this bunch is impressive.<br /><br />Favorites include opener Son Et Lumiere, Inertiatic ESP, Eriatarka, This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed (the chorus of this one lodged in my head for days), and the emotional climax of Televators. If you want a truly progressive release that will reveal more and more with each listen and show where the formidable talents of the defunct ATDI are heading these days, Deloused In The Comatorium is absolutely essential.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Buy this album, it is one of the best releases of 2003.   If you heard the mobile phone advert with David Beckham on it- it was jet &quot;are you gonna be my girl&quot; playing in the background. The song is also on the I-Pod advert.  <BR>The album has some very uplifting songs, and is the product of some amazing song writers.  Well worth buying.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I also thought that there was some mistake when I saw that there were only two discs, both which I had already rented.  I figured that I was missing the other two and was actually prepared to return it to the store!  What the hell is up with the price HBO??  Since I don't have HBO at home, I'm going to have to wait until the series is completely over to know what happened during the real second-half of Season 5.<br />I love Sex and the City. I don't want it to end. But come on..the price on this season should have been reduced.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This was an impulse buy for me, but I figured since I had &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring,&quot; I should invest in &quot;The Two Towers.&quot;  I'm a behind the scenes sort of geek and I loved the extra footage of how Peter Jackson and crew put everything together.  The real treat for me though was the behind the scenes music footage with Howard Shore composing the score.  <BR>Do I think &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is better than &quot;TFOTR?&quot;  I lean more towards &quot;TFOTR&quot; because of its introduction to Tolkien's worlds.  However, my favorite character, Eowyn, is brought in with this one, and the Battle for Helm's Deep just flat out kicked ass. So, overall, I'm tied with these two.<BR>What I liked about the extended edition also is the extra footage added.  We see the situation with Faramir and his complex relationship with his brother and father drawn out more which I was always interested in.<BR>If you've got a lot of time to kill, get this one.  However, if you're not really interested in the behind the scenes footage and/or extended scenes, then just purchase the regular edition.
B00005JKZV|2.0|It is to bad that overhyped and aggressive movie advertisement <BR>already hands out ready made and popularly rated opinions.<BR>Such is the case with &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, a typical Hollywood<BR>Bigbudget movie, greedily roasting on the popularity of its Title, fanbase and mucht better predecessor.<br />This Movie is nothing but smoke and air, the special effects only barely covering the sloppieness and terrible editing.<BR>Trimming the great story to the tastes of the average movie goer, the Producers and Director decided that giving it just enough action and the Occasional &quot;WOW Factor&quot; will abase and satisfy Moviegoers wordlwide. The old Hollywood recipe worked once again.<br />The artificiall action scenes, which pretend to make the story more interesting, completely weigh down any kind of emtional center,and cut loose any kind of connection and sympathy we might have developed with the Characters.  <br />No only does the Hollywood Hype give the movie an air and noise feel, but it make obvious the complete lack of cinematic genuenity and the terriblý weak script. This Film has no less then 190 terrible Movieblunders, mistakes so sloppy and careless that one is amazed how well they were covered up by the Bigbudgetfeel and the so called Epicscale.These mistakes can be seen at a Webiste called &quot;Movie Mistakes&quot;.
B000002KGT|3.0|My inner indie snob cringes when I think of this record. Rumours is a huge chart topper (I think at one point the best seller of all time, only to be ousted by Michael Jackson's Thriller). Everybody from that kid down the block to your grandmother owns a copy. Most of this album is a classic and lite radio mainstay. The production is slick and overengineered. The lyrics, on the surface, seem to be the same ol' cliches spouted out about love and loss. All in all, Rumours should be a target of derision on the same level as '70s crap like Kansas, Journey, The Eagles, Steve Miller Band, and other AOR rawk.<br />But it isn't. I, like most of the reviewers here, have a really hard time trying to pan this record. Rumours is far from being my favorite Fleetwood Mac album--I tend to gravitate more toward the bluesier Peter Green incarnation myself (though that's almost a COMPLETELY different band), and among the Buckingham/Nicks/McVie albums the self-titled album and the double LP Tusk slightly outrank it. Still, Rumours ranks among the better pop albums of the '70s, and it's aged a lot better than most of their contemporaries thanks to strong songwriting.<br /><br />All incarnations of Fleetwood Mac benefitted from considerable talent--this time applied in a poppier, less guitar-driven direction. Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie are two of the finest female vocalists in music, and Lindsey Buckingham's guitar playing and vocal contributions are seriously underrated. These songs would be lacking in a big way without him; listen to that wrenching solo he lays down on The Chain, for instance. The beautiful vocal harmonies and shimmering pop guitars of this lineup are in full force. The only musical annoyance is the prescence of some cheesy keyboards (on Don't Stop and You Make Loving Fun, in particular) but that's a fairly minor complaint.<br />Lyrically, most of the songs seem to be nothing special...until you realize what was going on within the band. You could hear the strains of the behind-the-scenes soap opera within the lyrics (&quot;damn your love, and damn your lies&quot;). There's also some wonderfully poetic moments on Gold Dust Woman and Dreams.<br />My favorites on the album are Go Your Own Way, the beautiful piano lament Songbird, Gold Dust Woman (which features the best vocal performance of Nicks' entire career IMO), and The Chain, written by the entire band and clearly the album's centerpiece. Overall, Rumours is a great pop album, but it's not quite a classic, and it's not Fleetwood Mac's best work--merely their most commercially successful.ns of the behind-the-scenes soap opera within the lyrics (&quot;damn your love, and damn your lies&quot;).

B000002L7Y|4.0|What better way to start off an album than with quite possibly the best song of all-time &quot;Take on Me&quot;.  Strongly followed up by 9 80s pop masterpieces, this album makes for a great listen from start to finish.  So you're having an 80s party and need some tunes?  Don't forget to set it off with &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, you'll be glad you did.

B000002LRX|5.0|While Mr. Bungle is rightfully respected as a more original and musically groundbreaking band, the significance of Angel Dust in popular music is incredible.  Preaching to a choir of underground musicians is a far simpler task than taking the pop structure of 3-5 minute songs and verse/chorus to a new level without bowing to the media, audiences, critics, or expectations.<br />I bought this album in '92 on the day it came out, having owned only a handful of heavy music that caught my ear (metallica, etc).  Angel Dust opened my eyes to sounds and emotions that I'd never heard or imagined, helping me realize that music isn't just a commodity for bobbing your head but an artistic form as complex as any other.  It inspired me to learn music, and more importantly seek out fresh sounds independent of marketing.  Connections with this album are immense:  John Zorn, Boredoms, Naked City, Secret Chiefs, Mr. Bungle, and even modern jazz like Louis Sclavis when listening to the progressions.  Of course there are better albums, but along with Nirvana, this is the most important landmark of rock music in the last 20-30 years.<br />Today I own over 600 albums, trying to absorb every sound around the world and include my own, and I consider this album to be the main cause.  Of everything I've heard since, nothing has affected me as much.
B00005JMCW|1.0|In this overrated flick from Disney, Jamie Lee Curtis and Linday Lohan play a mother and daugher who have their personaalities switched after eating Chinese food. The problem is that Anna the daughter is a spoiled brat of a teen and you loathe her instatntly. The mom Trish I think, has real problems and real issues. Anna cares only about herself and her social life and seeing her lighten up her mother's life is horrifying Trish does better as Anna but we dislike Anna already so she has a handicap. There is also an impossably bratty younger brother and a lame attempt at a romantic rivalry for anna's affections. I hope both the stars go on to bigger and better things but this movie will be a dead spot in their careers.
B00005JMFO|5.0|There are a lot of movies nowadays showing this subject: Love. But this movie has a magical element that brings excellent comedy situations and of course love. This is a movie where different characters interact during the movie, for the only goal of love. At the end, you will get a big surprise of how the movie joins everybody.<br />There is a mix of great artists; Hugh Grant makes as always an excellent performance, so as Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson and all the cast of \\"Love Actually\\". Also the movie gives another funny glimpse with Mr. Rowan Atkinson, he'll make you laugh. Beatiful and talented girls such as Martine McCutcheon and Kera Knightale. You will definitely enjoy this movie.
B00008NG5V|3.0|Jack Johnson's sophomore effort is good; it's nothing more, nothing less.  He continues on with some pretty creative songwriting, but fails to take it to a new level.  Lyrically he's the same &quot;loveable, I'm a really nice person trying to please everyone&quot; Jack that we grew to love on &quot;Brushfire Fairytails&quot;.  Some lyrics are quite confusing, for example, a lyrical excerpt from track 2, Jack boldly states &quot;Hallelujah Zig Zag Nothing&quot;.  Could anyone tell me what that means?  Another insightful lyric from track 8, &quot;The children were playing cricket with no shoes.&quot;  Where does that lyric fit into an acoustic pop album?  However, there are several stand out tracks on this album that will no doubt grab your attention.  All in all, it's a good album to chill to, but it won't hold your attention for too many listens.  One thing definitely remains clear...this guy loves surfing.
B000001F6T|5.0|I'm tired of people disparaging this album.  They seem to think that Ten Years After made a mistake by going in a more psychedelic direction.  Well they are wrong.  Wrong, I say!<br /><br />This is one hell of an album.  As usual, there's a wide variety of musical styles.  But unlike most other TYA albums, it's heavily drenched with psychedelia.  &quot;Going To Try&quot;, the opener, is the best example.  It goes from dark and eerie to fast and rockin' all in a matter of seconds.  Churchill's organ is very prominent here, especially when he plays those haunting notes in the beginnnig, amidst a wonderful vocal from Alvin.  But then, unexpectedly, Leo's bass starts pounding and the band  really  begins to get fired up and jam.  But you don't have much time to enjoy it before they slow down again and go back to that dreary, creepy atmosphere.  It's a killer song.<br />Churchill's short piano instrumental &quot;I Can't Live Without Lydia&quot; is pretty cool, and very jazzy.  Some would call it 'filler', but I enjoy it.  And speaking of jazz, &quot;Woman Trouble&quot; really swings.  Though it's certainly not their greatest jazz tune, it's still a good song, as Alvin once again shows that he's a real sport and lets all three of his bandmates get a chance to solo.  &quot;Skoobly-Oobly-Doobob&quot; (cool title, eh?) is awesome, I care not what anyone says.  It's basically a duet between Alvin and.....well.....himself.  See, he does all these &quot;Dooo-dooo-doo&quot; chants and simultaneously plays the same exact notes on his guitar.  It's kind of hard to explain in words, you have to hear it yourself.  But it's fantastic, the way he synchronizes his voice and his guitar notes.<br />&quot;Hear Me Calling&quot; was actually a very popular song by the band at the time.  A totally smokin' blues tune, it allows Alvin to unleash one of his sharpest, craziest solos ever.  And those weird vocals are the icing on the cake.  &quot;A Sad Song&quot; is simply a glorious ballad, witha riff that starts out simple and soft, then proceeds to suck you in as the song picks up the pace.  Alvin's singing on this one is extremely full of soul and emotion.  The overall mood of the song may be somewhat depressing, but it's so addicting that I never really notice.  Such a magnificent ballad.  &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; is dumb, I'll admit, but still kind of funny.  It's just a short little drum pattern from Ric Lee that really isn't impressive at all (a five year-old probably could've done that).  But what follows it is perhaps the greatest song that Ten Years After ever wrote.  It's called &quot;No Title&quot; (strange name for a song!), and it's one of the greatest rock songs that I've ever heard.  It's an 8-minute epic with five different parts, and all of them are astounding.  It starts out very slow, relaxed and peaceful, with Alvin delivering some whispery, soothing vocals (the lyrics are outstanding too).  Then, when you least expect it, the tranquility is gone and Alvin comes in with a rip-roaring, almost deafening guitar jam.  It's amazing.  It goes from unbelievably soft to unbelievably loud before you can even blink an eye!  The first time I heard it, I nearly jumped out of my seat!  It REALLY takes you by surprise, believe me.  Anyway, after Alvin's vicious guitar solo, Churchill comes in and takes you away to another world with his trippy organ playing (VERY trippy, actually).  After that, the rhythm section gets their turn, as Leo and Ric play some swingy, jazzy bass and drum stuff.  And then, for the conclusion, the song slows back down again and returns to it's original, mellow feel.  WOW!  What a song.  It's undoubtedly my favorite TYA song ever.  Five different parts, and not one of them boring.  Too bad they don't make music like this anymore.<br />Leo's short bass solo &quot;Faro&quot; is kind of odd, to say the least.  One of the very few examples of &quot;psychedelic bass&quot; that you'll ever find.  And the closing number, &quot;Speed Kills&quot;, is a 50's style rocker in which Alvin's vocals sound almost identical to Jerry Lee Lewis.  No foolin'!  Very big similarity.  The rhythm section provides a rockin' groove, and Alvin's solo is.....well.....this is Alvin Lee we're talking about, so I don't think I need to tell you that the solo is awesome.<br />Definitely get this album if you're a fan of psychedelia, blues, jazz or just flat-out killer rock 'n roll.  This is definitely their weirdest album ever.  But in this case, weird means excellent!
B000002H33|5.0|this is an awesome cd a classic for sure i love this album the best of metallica by far i just started geting into metallica because all my friends are big metalica fans so i gave it a shot and purchessed master of puppet let me tell ya i listened to that cd 8 times before i fell asleep it is amazing if you like metallica and you dont have it yet get as fast as you can if you like ac/dc you might like this album but you might want to listen to it first any way i will die a metallica fan peace out to my homies that got me into em james and josh later

B0000AQS6R|3.0|When you buy Christmas Vacation buy it for the movie that it is not for the special features and just watch the movie that way it is. Although stay away from that commentary track because you will probably hate this movie after viewing the commentary track. O.K there are just too many people talking on that commentary I used to wonder the more people on a DVD commentary track the better looks like I was wrong these actors in the film most of them except the king of the film Chevy Chase? are just talking and talking about some of the worst things Beverly D'Angelo talks about her hair and people just interrupt each other like they have no manners or something and they talk of Chevy Chase like he has passed on or something. The commentary on the original vacation is much better Chevy Chase is on that one and Director Harold Ramis and Matty Simmons give alot more insightful information about the film. I do not know what happened on the Christmas Vacation DVD though the commentary stinks! Just watch the film as it is and laugh your butt off I wish though Warner Bros would released alot more on the DVD like how about a featurette or maybe the Making of Christmas Vacation or possibly there had to have been at least one Deleted Scene. I know Warner Bros has these things but they are just not releasing these bits. The picture though looks great. Warner Bros needs to add more to there DVD's they are kind of plain and has anyone ever seen the DVD for that other Chevy Chase movie Funny Farm it just doesn't get any plainer than that but anyway Christmas Vacation is a winner but the extras are WEAK.
B000001F6S|5.0|After releasing their debut album and earning a reputation as an earth-shattering live band, Ten Years After decided to record their second album, UNDEAD, in a small club in England called Klooks Kleek (it was not recorded at The Marquee Club, as many people seem to think).  It amply demonstrates the uncanny stamina of the band in concert.<br />This is primarily a jazz album, except for one song, the slow blues &quot;Spider In My Web&quot;.  All the other songs are pure jazz, and Lee plays them so damn good that you almost begin to wonder if the guy was born with a guitar in his hands!  I'm telling you - no other guitarist in the world has ever played jazz like Lee does on this album.  The best example, of course, is &quot;At The Woodchopper's Ball&quot;, in which the boys take Woody Herman's jazz classic and turn it into a breathless jamming extravaganza.  Just listen to those guitar licks, unbelievable or what?!  Alvin's playing is so fast, smooth and fluid that you simply can't help but marvel at him.  And if you listen closely, after Churchill's organ solo, he even inserts a few guitar lines from &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot;!  But with all due respect to Bill Haley, he could never match this in his wildest dreams.  Anyway, Leo Lyons is also given a bass solo, although it's nothing spectacular (I'm MUCH more fascinated by the way he thumps his instrument on the Woodstock version of &quot;I'm Going Home&quot;).  But you hardly even get a chance to contemplate his bass before Alvin comes back and rips into it one more time for the grand finale.  AWESOME!<BR>No other song on the album could hope to beat that masterpiece of jamming, but they do come awful close.  &quot;I May Be Wrong, But I Won't Be Wrong Always&quot; also swings pretty good, and once again, Alvin plays some killer licks and Churchill and Lyons are each given a chance to solo (you could never accuse Alvin of hogging the spotlight).  The slow blues tune &quot;Spider In My Web&quot; shows Alvin taking a page out of Eric Clapton's book and delivering some stunning blues work.  That is, until it comes time for the solo, when he just freaks out and starts playing a thousand notes per second!  <BR>&quot;Summertime&quot; is a trip, with some rather psychedelic guitar licks.  And it segues into Ric Lee's drum tour-de-force &quot;Shantung Cabbage&quot;.  Ric is definitely a very underrated drummer, and he proves it here.  I just love the way he wails on that snare drum.  <BR>And last, but certainly not least, is &quot;I'm Going Home&quot;.  While not nearly as mind-blowing as the Woodstock version, it's still quite good.  VERY good, in fact.  The intro alone is fabulous, as Alvin introduces some blazing notes before the rest of the band follows him and starts to get a killer groove going.  Perfect way to end a perfect album.<br />Ride on, Mr. Lee!
B000001F3C|5.0|War was one of the first c.d`s I ever owned,besides Abba`s '' Arrival '' which my father bought me and I don`t like to talk about !! I quickly tossed Arrival in the bin and adopted War as my new favourite record.20 years later I still hold it dear to my heart. It kicks off with sunday bloody sunday, which ''is not a rebel song'' according to Mr Hewson.It wasn`t either, merely a plea for the carnage to stop.Next came ''seconds'',another plea to stop f----g around with war toys and nuclear weapons.New years day was next,the first single off the record.A hauntingly beautiful song which I never quite learnt was about. Then ''like a song'' which has to be the most powerful track on the c.d.Drowning Man follows which still stands as my pick as best track.The Edge`s glorious Lap Steel blew me away and still does whenever I hear it.''Take my hand, you know I`ll be there if you can I`ll cross the sky for your love'', wails Bono, in a time when I think his voice was nearing, if not at it`s peak.''Two hearts beat as one'' was the second single from the then record/cassette.It made a dent in the charts but didn`t really need to - the album spoke for itself and sold accordingly.People were lining up to buy the next record ''The Unforgettable Fire'' and why?? Because everyone had War,knew how bloody good it was,and wanted their new material.Sadly, it actually outsold War but was not half as good an album. Amazing what a top 5 single can do for you !! ( Refering to Pride ) .Anyhow, War continues in pretty much the same mood throughout the album.The Refugee, Red Light, Surrender and 40 all  play their part in making this album in my mind, the best record of the 80`s.It really does put ''Zooropa'' to shame, and that`s not easy to say because I worship U2. If you are even mildly into this band,I would thoroughly recommend this c.d.It was quite unique for its time and would possibly be alot of U2 fans most cherished U2 record.
B000060K4O|5.0|\\"Ghostbusters\\" is one of the most memorable sci-fi comedy hybrid films of the early 1980s and for really good reason, it was a very witty, hilarious and highly original plot with awesome directing and amazing special effects which while somewhat dated in appearance, were very innovative back in it's time in 1984, before CGI effects would take the driver's seat not too long afterwards. The story and plot are really funny yet smart at the same time. The second Ghostbusters movie succeeds in going in a much more dramatic direction but the first one though compliments that sequel with a light-hearted and comedic style that few sci-fi films have matched over the years since this movie came out.<br />The movie is a story of four oddball scientists at a university who are kicked out because of their excessive studying of the occult. They find themselves go into a different career by means of becoming a 'ghost fighting' team called the Ghostbusters and station themselves at an old firehouse. Their mission is to fight off bad spirits, poltergeists and spirits wreaking havoc on New York's population. A woman named Dana Barrett, a resident of a large apartment building also discovers that her residency is the doorway to a dimension of an ancient demonic goddess named Gozer the Gozerian who threatens to unleash havoc on New York and ultimately the world and now the Ghostbusters are called to action to save The Big Apple from meeting it's possible annihilation from the evil forces that the dimension in Barrett's apartment threatens to unleash.<br /> This movie truly breaks some new grounds with amazing special effects which while look extremely dated by 2004 standards, are still a visual feast to look at especially when the various bad vibes were unleashed when the Environmental agency leader shut down the containment system. The special effects look even more dated than those on the \\"Terminator\\" movie which came out around the same time. At the same time though, they give the movie a unique appeal that is found in few if any other movie since then because speciall effects while remaining awesome to watch, have gotten overused in some movies to where they overshadow the story and are CGI'd excessively. The second Ghostbusters movie took what was great about this one and built on it to create an even better sequel in my opinion but this 1984 original is not a moive that you should ever pass up the opportunity of getting your hands on and is among the greatest movies ever made during the 1980s.movie a unique appeal that is found in few if any other movie since then because speciall effects while remaining awesome to watch, have gotten overused in some movies to where they overshadow the story and are CGI'd excessively.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|The thing I really like about this CD is that there is a sound for almost everyone who likes stage music.  It has the perky, upbeat, fun music in a song like &quot;Popular&quot; or &quot;What Is This Feeling?&quot;.  It has serious songs, displaying more finished musical telnt in a song like &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, and then you hear songs that are soulful like &quot;For Good&quot; or &quot;The Gilr Inside&quot;.  I had a lot of trouble deciding between four or five stars for the rating, but the musical talents of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth put it over the top toward the five rating.  I would really recommend this soundtrack...
B00001MXXH|1.0|As always, when I replace my VHS copies of my movies with DVD's I check the format to make sure that I am getting true widescreen presentations. Ferris, I'm sad to say, is the worst that I have seen when it comes to the so-called widescreen format. If you have ever compared the full screen version to the DVD widescreen version you will see that all was done basically was to insert the black bars on the top and bottom of the picture. There are scenes where we should be seeing people's entire bodies  but in the widescreen they are cut to the waistline. If you still have your VHS copy, KEEP IT! At least until the studios stop cheating us and start to actually release true widescreen formats on ALL of their DVD's and not just a select few.

Mike Judge does an excellent job of squeezing hummor out of every quirky nuisance of working in an office enviornment and the politics that can surround it.<BR>Everthing from brown-nosers to annoying bosses.<BR>The amount of one-liners in this flick are endless.<BR>You won't be disappointed!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie rocks!  I can't wait for the extended version of Return of the King!!
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Most sequels are simply excuses to cash in on the success of an original blockbuster entry in a promising franchise, and &quot;MIB 2&quot; is no exception. However, the joke herein is that this film is nothing more (or less) than a faithful, witty  continuation of the ideas begun in the original &quot;MIB&quot;. Is it as effective? No, of course not, much like &quot;Rocky 2&quot; was not as effective as &quot;Rocky&quot;. That unique spark of theatrical originality that all initial entries have is gone.Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. &quot;MIB 2&quot; is funny, fast paced, and very enjoyable. There are far worse ways to spend your time. If you're a die - hard fan of &quot;Men in Black &quot;,I suggest picking up this dvd. This is good stuff. Definitely makes the idea of a &quot;MIB 3&quot; worth waiting for.
B000063DFN|5.0|I didn't actually buy this album... Instead I downloaded every song from the net. And to tell you something... This ROCKS!!!<BR>Iron Maiden has never sounded this good! Aces High is the perfect opener in my opinion with its unbelievably fast guitars and excellent drumming. the story is based on the aerial combat of Great Britain in the early days.  Two Minutes to Midnight is one of the first Iron Maiden songs I've heard and until now, it still packs a punch. Losfer Words is a definite classic in its own way even though its an instrumental. Its the 4th and final instrumental the band has made. The Duellists and Flash of the Blade is two-part saga that will pack a real punch into you as it sweeps you off your feet. Beautiful instrument usage and great vocals. The story is about a swordfight basically. A medievil warrior avenging his family. Back In the Village is one of the most underrated tracks I've heard. The verses and instrument usage is great but the chorus leaves a lot to be desired. The title track Powerslave is one of the greatest metal songs you'll hear. Themed in ancient Egypt, this tells the story of a slave. the final track is definetely the greatest Iron Maiden song of all time. a 14-minute epic that will have you listening to it all throughout... and making you play it again!<br />Overall, this is definetely a Maiden classic! UP THE IRONS!
B00005JLXE|4.0|I think watching this film at the theaters is worth your time and money. Now I will give you my opionion on the DVD wide-screen release. Considering all the extras included in the set, I think it makes for a good buy. Not GREAT but definitely worthy of your hard earnd $ if you factor in the behind-the-scenes footage of the film and the history behind the Daredevil saga.<BR>I think Jennifer Garner radiates as Electra not only in her beauty, but her brawn. She kicks butt in this flick and Collin Farrel is a convincing pysco. Weather you're a Ben Afflect fan or not, very few could've pulled off the title character as he did and being a comic book fan, I liked his portrayal.
0446530573|5.0|If, like me, you are addicted to the Sopranos and have seldom seen an Italian dish you didn't like, you will find this cookbook much to your taste. In addition to the recipes, there is much information about almost everyone on the Sopranos. The introduction is by Artie Bucco; he then interviews several members of the Soprano family-- Janice, Junior, Carmela. Tony et al. Carmela on why she does all the cooking for her family herself and doesn't hire a cook: &quot;I don't like strangers in my house, nor does Tony.&quot; I bet. Tony gives advice on how to grill perfectly and points out that grilling is almost genetically a masculine activity. We can only hope that he doesn't pass out from an anxiety attack and fall into the lighted grill. There are lots of food tips here--party tips by Carmela and Charmaine-- as well as Junior's advice on how to live long and well.<br />These Italian recipes, which Artie tells us when the world thinks Italian food, they really mean Neapolitan food, to my unpracticed eye appear to be quite comprehensive. I know that a lot of good desserts are included. I can testify to the quality of Mom's Pear and Grappa Pound Cake on page 71. It's moist and light with a nice flavor of alcohol that does not overpower. There are also recipes for Baba au Rhum, Cannoli, Tiramisu, Zabaglione and a Ricotta-Pineapple Pie that Carmela made for a local professional woman on one of the shows. &quot;She must have really enjoyed it--she came trhough so nicely,&quot; Carmela tells Artie. Hey, I don't want to take anything away from this lady's cooking skills, but as I remember the series, the professional &quot;came through&quot; after Tony turned up the heat on her.<br /> There are many color photographs of members of the cast as well as of the food. This cookbook is a lot of fun.
B000002KKC|3.0|Tusk ... A masterpiece or an embarrassment? A bit of both really ... The masterpieces of this very mixed album would have to be.. Well Stevie Nicks' songs, 'Sara' 'Sisters Of The Moon' and 'Storms&quot;, Christine McVie's 'Over and Over', and Lindsey Buckingham's (!) 'Tusk' and, purely for the clever lyrics, 'The Ledge' and the comical 'Not That Funny'.<br />I have to agree with Lindsey's logic, it probably was the right thing to do to break away from 'Rumours', but I think that maybe he got ever so slightly carried away in his garage or wherever he creates his music. A lot of his songs are demo standard, and maybe should have been dropped or slightly toned down for a more listenable effect. On the other hand, Christine McVie's songs, with the exception of the first two are SO boring and lightweight it's almost unbelieveable! Brown Eyes being the prime candidate for this example! WHAT WERE THEY DOING IN THAT STUDIO FOR 13 MONTHS? 9 of these tracks sound like they were thrown together during a particularly large drinking session where everyone just went mad and pressed every button and key and string they could to see what would happen.<br />Stevie Nicks claims she sat in the viewing area unless she was needed for this album, and I think she was probably spared from whatever the other members were poisoned with in there, because all of her songs are classic and she is the only saviour of this album. 'Sara' is an absolute masterpiece, as is the gentle 'Storms', and 'Sisters Of The Moon' has that ethereal edge with a heavy rock end, which makes it a stand out track with 'Sara', 'Tusk', and the soft 'Over and Over'.<br />HOWEVER, despite the tragedies, (Brown Eyes, Save Me A Place, Honey Hi - COME ON and Never Make Me Cry), this album has a certain quirky edge that makes you want to listen to it a few times to fully understand it, and some of the songs are so brilliant, they almost make up for the large proportion of disappointments.<br />In conclusion, Good and Bad, so it's up to you whether you want to listen to an experimental masterpiece but commercial tragedy. If you want rarer songs like 'Beautiful Child' and 'Angel', buy it ... If you don't, leave it and buy Greatest Hits for the stand out tracks.so it's up to you whether you want to listen to an experimental masterpiece but commercial tragedy.

B000063CMK|2.0|First, let me say that I am a big fan of Pain of Salvation's older material.  &quot;Entropia&quot; and &quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; are both excellent albums, and showed a talented band with tremendous potential.  &quot;The Perfect Element&quot; was decent, but was well below those albums in songwriting quality.  But this?  Well, this is just abhorrent.  I really can't even believe it's the same band.  A band that once did such ambitious, original, interesting music has dumbed down to boring pop trash.  I can't even stand to listen to this thing, and I've had it since the day it came out.  The amount of fans that consider this their greatest work is just bewildering.  I suspect that most of them are just fairweather fans, who had never even heard of them until &quot;The Perfect Element&quot; came out.  I've been listening to them since &quot;One Hour...&quot;, and I consider this to be well below their standards.  I really hope the next album is better, because this is pathetic.
B000000OU0|4.0|The Eagles have their place in Music History (Biggest Selling Album of all time &quot;Their Greatest Hits 1971 - 1975&quot;, Rock `n Roll Hall of Fame etc etc)but did you know they acheived all that on the back of only about 60 tunes, not all written by them.  That is probably the most outstanding feat of the Eagles, that so little has created so much.  For me therefore the major aspect of &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; is the four new tracks.  I and most Eagles fans worldwide hunger for new material and can`t wait for the new studio album (circa 2004??) In the meantime whe will just be content with the newest Eagles material, new from 1994!  <br />&quot;Get Over It&quot; is Henley all the way lyrically, married to some great Frey rock `n roll licks, the guitar playing is outstanding with all three, Walsh &amp; Felder contributing (at least live) very well.  I always crank this song up.  &quot;Love will keep us alive&quot; is written by Jim Capaldi (ex Traffic)Paul Carrack (ex Roxy Music, XTC &amp; UK Squeeze) and Pete Vale.  Just how Tim Schmit got to sing this one, I`m not to sure and would love to find out if anyone knows.(E:Mail available on my about me page) This is lovely, balladeering, by a champion of the artform and finally gives Tim another song to do live.  &quot;Girl From Yesterday&quot; is pure Nashville all the way and possibly the most countrified song the Eagles ever did, ever!!  Even this song has its merits and I like the lyrics especially.  The last new tune &quot;Learn to be Still&quot; is chock full of Henleyisms and could easily have come from any of his solo albums.  It features strong guitar playing but little of some of the other things that made Eagles music famous like the harmonies and killer choruses.  Anyway regardless of the strengths or weaknesses of these songs its still the Eagles and for this myopic fan is therefore amongst the greatest music ever recorded.
0679428895|4.0|Depending on your expectations, you may find Harris's latest work a fast paced exposition on the last days of Pompeii or a crafty novel aimed squarely at a mass market audience.  It is, of course, both.  Harris won't be winning any awards for the depth of characterization.  We've got noble gladiators, corrupt politicians and even an innocent damsel who releases her captive songbirds from a cage.  Fortunatley, the plot moves so fast and so deftly, there is barely time to consider the weaknesses of the book as Vesuvius boils in the background.  Harris has the skill of a good historical novelist, little factual gems are slipped, inconspicuously, into the reader's path.  Whether it's the flow of an aquaduct, or the taste of a honey coated mouse, Harris is able to use his research well, bringing the cities of Southern Italy to life.  And though the same can't be said of his characters, if you're looking for fast paced diversion, you won't be let down by Harris.

B00005AFMT|5.0|King Crimson is without question the greatest and most significant progressive band of all time.  From their classic 70's albums, like &quot;Lark's Tongues in Aspic&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;, to their modern masterpieces, &quot;Thrak&quot; and &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;, they have proven over the years to be remarkably consistent.  I would put this album at the very top of their fantastic catalog.  Full of sick grooves, incredible musicianship, and a bottomless well of creativity, there is just nothing else like this.  If you consider yourself to be a fan of any kind of progressive music, you owe it to yourself to buy this, and just about everything else they have done.  No one has ever touched them, and no one ever will.

B00005J6SZ|5.0|In early 1984, Madonna was just another singer with a few hits. With the release of &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, she became the icon her fans know and love. The title track and &quot;Material Girl&quot; are still two of her best known songs.  The album has more than that, though! &quot;Material Girl&quot; is the opening song, and you can't help but think of the video when you hear it. A classic. Next up is another single, &quot;Angel&quot; that is somewhat forgotten. It's a nice midtempo song with great singing from Madge. This is followed by the title track. Ahh, yes, who hasn't heard this one? Quintessential 80's for sure. Madonna's first number one is really good, even if it is a little dated. The music on this remastered version sounds great, too.  Next up is &quot;Over and Over&quot;, a fun,uptemo song. After that is &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot;, famously released on single 12 years later. It is the hidden gem of the album, proving the depth in Madonna's voice and her ability to sing a good ballad (although &quot;Crazy For You&quot; soon proved this too). &quot;Dress You Up&quot; is next, and is another memorable uptempo song, one of the best on the album.&quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo&quot; follows, and although it may have a silly title and a few silly lyrics, it's a very good slow song. Next are two pretty good uptempo numbers, &quot;Pretender&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;. The album is finished off with the really good 12&quot; versions of &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;. Overall, this isn't Madonna's best work, but it is really fun and shows why she became huge. An essential album of the eighties and a perfect addition to any Madonna collection.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I can only imagine what fans of the original cult classic, THE EVIL DEAD, thought when they watched EVIL DEAD II. Its predecessor was an eerie gorefest designed for one sole purpose: to scare the living hell out of the audience. That said, EVIL DEAD II is a completely different film. In fact, it has much more in common with a Three Stooges sketch than it does with films like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br />The film opens with a re-hash of the first film: young Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) travel to an abandoned cabin in the woods of Michigan. There Ash unwittingly unleashes an evil force which has been lying dormant in the forest - a force which likes to possess human flesh and torment the living. After decapitating his possessed girlfriend with a shovel, Ash struggles to maintain his sanity and ward off the evil force; things become a little more complicated with a group of strangers, led by the daughter of the cabin's original owner (Sarah Berry), wind up fighting for their lives alongside Ash.  <br /> <br />I was blown away by EVIL DEAD II the first time I watched it. It was after watching it that I came to appreciate just how great a horror film could be. As I've said before, EVIL DEAD II isn't traditional horror. It's horror-tinged slapstick comedy, in the vein of the Three Stooges (of which director/co-writer Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell are huge fans). There's some wonderfully over-the-top stuff in this film, thanks to a wacky script by Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel and some kooky special effects by Mark Shostrom. Joseph LoDuca's score perfectly captures the glumness of Ash's situation, while also capturing the tongue-in-cheek feeling of the film.  <br /> <br />To me, the greatest point of the film is the camera work. There is some spectacular camera work here: wide shots, distorted close-ups, forty-five degree angles, a point-of-view shot from an eyeball (!). The best camera work in the film occurs through the point-of-view of the evil force (whose form, in a clever move, we never see). The force - and the audience - flies through the forest towards the cabin. It breaks down the door and proceeds to chase Ash through every single room of the house, around winding corners and through doors. It's simply brilliant. <br /> <br />While most of the acting is less-than-spectacular, Bruce Campbell's performance is classic. It's no surprise that Campbell is viewed as God by his fans. He is hilarious as Ash, portraying him as a not-so-clever sap with some sharp one-liners. Although Ash (and Campbell) is at his finest in the third EVIL DEAD film - the cult hit ARMY OF DARKNESS - Ash undoubtedly has his moments in this film. Campbell does some wonderful stuff when Ash's hand becomes possessed by the evil. The hand, now with an (evil) mind of its own, decides to torture Ash by smashing kitchenware over his head and making him do some pretty amazing stunts. Finally, in one of the most famous scenes in horror film history, Ash takes care of the hand ... <br /> <br />It's no surprise that EVIL DEAD II is the cult legend that it is. It is certainly one of the very finest horror films I've ever seen, and it has been one of my very favorite films since I first saw it. It's a masterpiece, a major improvement over its predecessor. From the fast-paced beginning to the magnificent ending (which sets up the third film), it's a wacky, hilarious ride that no horror fan can miss. Highly recommended.
B0000CBHOI|4.0|Pros: Great Films and Bonus Features are top notch.<br />Cons: You just want more vintage clips<br />Scorsese seems to have decided to use a variety of directors to tell the story of the blues from a new and fresh perspective. Its not as much a history lesson as it is indeed a journey. Some are documentary and some mix fictional segments with historical reality. But whether the high concepts work or not really doesn't matter as much as how enjoyable the music and content is when exploring the set as a whole. There's great documentary footage, interviews, and contemporary performances. One of the best aspects of the DVDs, is the way it was designed to make finding the music easily, more than finding a narative chapter. The bonus material features everything from complete never before seen out takes to extensions of performances and clips seen in the films. The DVD's all open with beautiful graphics and interesting menu design pages. The standard extras like director commentary and bios are there, but there is also so much more including interviews with the directors, no shortage of bonus music most in 5.1 and stereo, and best of all is the fact that the menus, navigation and architechture is state of the art, and the new feature to play just the music from the films skipping the narrative that brackets each tune is a tremendous idea. Although, since some clips are short, it does leave you wanting to hear more in almost every case. The fact that Scorsese used his skills and that of 6 other directors including Clint Eastwood, Mike Figgis, Wim Wenders, Richard Pearce, Charles Burnett and Marc Levin to make these films was overall a very successful idea. The films alone would make a good box set to own, but add the fact that they brought veteran music filmmaker Michael Borofsky into the mix to create the DVD's from the sensitivities of what a serious music consumer would like to do with these DVDs makes the overall package one of the best I have ever owned.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|I watched this movie with a friend and had no foreknowledge of what the movie was about or how great the movie was.  I found the movie watchable especially for the special effects and the costuming. For example, it was quite cool when the elder vampire gradually became more human looking as the blood regenerated.  If you're expecting a great storyline or surprising twists, you'll be disappointed, but vampire and lycanthropy efficiandos will enjoy the film.  Maybe a tad overdramatic and inexpicably long (only 2 hours but seemingly longer), the movie is still worth watching.
B000002BPS|5.0|I have Smash on to Splinter of the Offspring.  This album is true punk, and is their Columbia debut that went multi-platinum.  It is an amazing CD that is most likely Offsprings most complete.  It offers up everything to the table, leaving nothing behind.<br />1.Desclaimer-10/10 Funny, possibly best intro of Offsprings.<br />2.The Meaning of Life-10/10 Shows real signs of hardcore punk that made Offspring a underground success with Smash.<br />3.Mota-10/10 Shows highlights of Offspring to come with Americana and on.  It is funny, yet insightful, I guess.<br />4.Me&amp;My Old Lady-10/10 please I just beg of Offspring, do not write about this type of topic every again, it is now burned into my mind and it has tortured me for quite some time.  Anyway, a good punk/leading to distrubed mainstream song.<br />5.Cool To Hate-10/10 The anthem for all those that are floaters, for the ones who hate everyone.<br />6.Leave it Behind-10/10 Again yet another song that serves up a high dose of punk with raging lyrics.<br />7.Gone Away-10/10 Wow!  Let me just say it is a rarity when Offspring leaps from their simple and fun loving nature to go off and make a sensere song.  That is exactly what this is, a song sung with senserity, and pain, leaving all out musical and vocal talent(its Dex baby) on the table.<br />8. I Choose-10/10 Goes back down to simple degrating and humiliating Offspring which is so so great!<br />9. Intermission-8/10 From all that rocking I needed a break, but not elevator music.<br />10.All I Want-10/10 Another fabulous punk rock song that truly shows what Offspring is about.<br />11. Way Down the Line-10/10 Depressing song about ending up like our parents, uh oh!<br />12. Don't Pick it Up-10/10 Teaches a valuable lesson that all should learn.<br />13. Amazed-10/10 I am amazed that the Offspring came up with an album of this magnitude that includes another punk song, true Offspring raging guitars, bass and drums.<br />14.Change the World-10/10 And to complete this masterpiece comes another great song that is surprisingly long by Offspring standards.  <br />Overall this is a complete work of musical simplicity that breeds absolute power, agnst, and fun! 10/10
B00008S2VG|4.0|I CONSIDER MYSELF A HUGE MADONNA FAN AND PURCHASE EVERY RELEASE SHE HAS RELEASED. I M REVIEWING THIS ALMBUM ALMOST A YEAR AFTER ITS RELEASE AND AFTER A YEAR I CONSIDER IT GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. THE ALBUM HAS MANY GREAT MADONNA SONGS BUT AS WHOLE ITS NOT UP TO HER PREVIOUS EFFORTS. I LOVE NOTHING FAILS AND RATE THIS AS ONE OF HER BEST SONGS EVER. I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY THE SINGLE DIDNT DO BETTER ON THE CHARTS HAD IT BEEN THE FIRST SINGLE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL. I LIKE THE SONG AMERICAN LIFE, LOVE PROFUSION , LONG RIDE AND NOBODY KNOWS ME.  BUT THE SLEEPER HIT ON THIS ALBUM IS INTERVENTION WHICH IS THE SECOND BEST TRACK, AFTER NOTHING FAILS ON THE ALBUM. AS ALWAYS THIS IS A DIFFERENT MADONNA.  A MORE FOLK SOUNDING POP ROCK MADONNA BUT PERSONALLY I STILL PREFER THE MORE RB MADONNA OF BEDTIME STORIES. WHICH STILL STANDS AS MY FAVORITE MADONNA ALBUM.
B00006LLNU|4.0|This CD is an experience.  It's not something you listen to-you can FEEL the music.  It's something that I've never really experienced before.  It's some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.  I'll warn you that there aren't any fast paced tracks on this CD.  This CD is very ambient, but being so, it is very different and beautiful.  So, if you are looking for a fast paced guitar CD, don't get this.  But if you are looking for some of the most beautiful music ever written, then buy this CD.

055357342X|5.0|R.R. Martin never ceases to amaze me.  As in the previous two books in this series, A Storm of Swords kept my attention with its in-depth storyline and complex characters.  You can't anticipate what will happen next in these books, because once you think things are going to work out as expected, the story begins to back-flip and cartwheel.  All we can do is just hang on for the ride, and try to appreciate the genius that Martin has shown us through this literary masterpiece.

B00005MP58|5.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit that it wasn't until a few months ago that I first read Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice. It had been on my &quot;to read&quot; list for quite some time, but for whatever reason I just never got around to reading it earlier. When I finally started it, I found I could not put it down, and I finished the book in a little more then one day's time. I loved it. Pride and Prejudice instantly ranked high among my favorite pieces of classic literature. Having already seen and very much enjoyed the movie Bridget Jones's Diary (a modern-day adaptation of Pride and Prejudice) in which Colin Firth plays a modern Mr. Darcy, I was very eager to see this highly acclaimed BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, with Firth as the original Darcy.<br />This movie version of the classic story was everything I hoped for and more. It is the most direct book-to-movie adaptation of any novel I've ever seen, with the filmmakers adhering almost without exception to the original storyline. Even the dialogue relies heavily on direct quotes from the book. I have only noticed three very minor deviances, all of which I feel actually enhance the story, rather than detractng from it:<br />(1) The opening shot of the movie, showing Darcy and Bingley riding across the countryside on their horses to look at the Netherfield estate, is not included in the book, which opens with the Bennet family learning of Mr. Bingley's arrival there.<br />(2) The scene in which the tormented Darcy throws himself into the pond at Pemberley and emerges, to stop the hearts of many a female viewer, in a deliciously clinging wet shirt is, needless to say, not in the book.<br />(3) The end of the movie, showing Elizabeth and Darcy's wedding, is another addition to the story, though I found it most welcome, as the book left me wanting a little more closure, which the movie provides.<br />The entire cast is unbeatable, with every actor and actress turning in a flawless performance. Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Elizabeth, and captured her character exactly as it had been in my head while reading the book. Her small nuances of facial expression display all the depths of Lizzy's personality in a way I can imagine few other actresses being able to accomplish. Likewise, Colin Firth is the ideal Mr. Darcy. I can't imagine any other actor doing as well. He manages to convey a wide range of emotions while remaining austere and short on words. The actors and actresses playing the shrill Mrs. Bennet, the delightful Mr. Bennet, the good-hearted Jane, the frivolous Lydia, the prudish Mary, the simple but loveable Mr. Bingley, the fearsome Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the imbecilic Mr. Collins, and the rogueish Whickham are all equally good.<br />My one major disappointment with this DVD is the poor picture quality, which alternates between bad and even worse (and hence why I've knocked half a point off of my rating). At best it is a little fuzzy, and at worst it is sometimes downright grainy. The color balance also fluctuates. I would have liked to have seen this touched up more, as it would have completed an otherwise perfect viewing experience. Despite the poor image quality, however, I would highly recommend this film version of Pride and Prejudice to any fan of the novel, and even to those who have not read the book, as it follows the novel so precisely. Definitely two thumbs up!e is the perfect Elizabeth, and captured her character exactly as it had been in my head while reading the book.

B0000VCZKM|3.0|Why go to the bother of &quot;remastering&quot; a wonderful movie if all you're going to do is release a full screen version.  It's absolutely painful to watch.  There is so much missed that's just off screen.  It's a huge disappointment because it really is a wonderful movie but this full screen DVD is just to difficult to watch.  <br />I want my widescreen version!  Please someone release one.
6305971935|1.0|I am a 29 year old man who remebered this movie fondly from my childhood.  So i pointed, clicked and oredered it up.  I was horrified the instant the menu came up on screen and the option to start the movie was spelled wrong, it read &quot;STRAT MOVIE&quot;.  This should give you some idea as to the level of care and attention that went into the production of this inferior product.<br />  The picture quality was unforgivable. Usually a bad transfer doesnt bother me that much as long as I can see whats going on, but this movie transfer is pathetic. I am not kidding when I say that you are better off ordering a clean VHS copy than wasting your time and money on this DVD. It was absolutely unwatchable on my widescreen TV, I eventually had to put it in my computer to watch it as the &quot;pixelization&quot; was so bad ... consider youself warned.....
B0000CEB4V|5.0|this amazing concert gave me goose bumps several times. the dts option is awesome and made me feel like I was watching the live concert itself..really crisp and clean sound!  one thing that'll make me watch this over and over again is Billy Preston's  brilliant performance and interpretation of Isn't it a Pity. Never have I heard and felt a tingle in my spine watching somebody play the organ until Mr. Preston.  The Indian musicians are exceptional as well.  The mixture of Eastern and Western music made this concert unique and truly proved that MUSIC IS THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE. This DVD is truly a treasure as are George's music...
0345363132|5.0|This is the book that first led me to believe that maybe Richard didn't do it. If you've ever felt sympathetic to Richard III then you'll like this book. Sharon K. Penman blends history and fiction together so you really feel like you are getting to the know the characters and don't feel as if you are just reading a textbook. It's a very enjoyable way to learn some history and if not to learn it's still a wonderful story to just enjoy.
B000059PPN|3.0|House by the cemetery is not a solid horror film by all means, and really will end up only on the shelves of Fulci or Italian Exploitation Devotees (most likely one and the same) such as myself. The casual horror-goer has much to be put off by, which I will get into in a moment.<br />First, I feel I should summarize a bit on the best period of Fucli's filmmaking, which spanned Zombi 2 to House by the Cemetery. Zombi 2 starts the 'series' off with a bang, delivering shocks and style and the best zombies ever to appear on celluloid (fx maestro Giannetto Di Rossi never even topped himself). The film was a more traditional zombie film in the sense that it took place in the Carribean and keeps with the feel, if not the facts, of vodun zombies. The second film, which is the first of his 'zombie trilogy', was City of the Living Dead. Here, Fulci shifts gears from the table he set in Zombi 2 and starts a series that is more united and share several character traits. The Gates of Hell have opened and the dead have begun to walk the earth. The story is scattered, as Fulci is just beginning to master the themes he would use so well in the Beyond, a dream-like masterpiece. Another Gate opens, and strange occurances, culminating with a zombie invasion, centre around an old hotel which was the site of an execution of a warlock many years earlier. Fulci's last Date with the Dead in the series was House by the Cemetery.<br />The film starts off with a rousing opening sequence, preparing the viewer for an onslaught that never arrives until almost 85 minutes later. While most of the previous films mentioned have little narrative structure and make barely an ounce of sense, there is even less to be found here. Yet before, where Fulci made up for this with stylish set pieces and mayhem, outside of the opening and the finale, there is little to keep your attention. The plot is nonexistent, as are the characters, and many 'surreal' sequences are plain absurd. The entire middle of the movie is non-stop talking head, during which nothing gets explained anyway, with only a few moments of the good stuff.<br />The casual horror fan (ie, the one that thought House of 1000 Corpses was the be all end all) will be chased away by the atrocious dubbing, though common with our beloved Italian Flicks, seems particularly bad here, most likely due to the boy cast as Bob, who seems as out of place as the man-child in Burial Ground. He appears almost too foreign...I can't quite place it. Italian Splatter fans will find the redeeming values, and Fulci fans will enjoy it as the last film in a great run.<br />In short, first-time Fulci viewers are safer to start with Zombi 2 and then peek at the Beyond. This and City of the Living Dead are most likely for the veterans to appreciate.ie is non-stop talking head, during which nothing gets explained anyway, with only a few moments of the good stuff.<br />The casual horror fan (ie, the one that thought House of 1000 Corpses was the be all end all) will be chased away by the atrocious dubbing, though common with our beloved Italian Flicks, seems particularly bad here, most likely due to the boy cast as Bob, who seems as out of place as the man-child in Burial Ground.

0385507755|5.0|I was prompted to read &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; (and &quot;Running With Scissors&quot;) after enjoying Augusten Burroughs' &quot;Dry&quot; which I read upon recommendation after enjoying Rikki Lee Travolta's &quot;My Fractured Life.&quot; This is a stunning book. It doesn't have the same humor as &quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;My Fractured Life&quot; which made it a little more testing to absorb, but once I did I loved it. It is scary and dramatic and sad, which I think gives this a rare sense of realism. Also, like &quot;My Fractured Life&quot; the author doesn't try to sugar coat the lead character to be a likeable &quot;hero.&quot; Instead he presents a man with many flaws, who at many times is very unlikable. But that's the point! Addicts are not necessarily people who are on their best behavior. I can't say enough. This is a great book.
0792844890|3.0|I think this movie is funny. Its not suppose to have good acting thats whats so funny! The story line I have to admit is stupid but some of it is funny. I don't like it as much because its a little cheesy!
0156029065|4.0|This is a good book by the master of complicated and erudite historical fiction - Umberto Eco. However I found that it wasn't as good as The Name of the Rose and Foucalt's Pendulum both of which I consider amazing. This novel is about Baudolino - born into a peasant family in rural Italy, he is adopted as a pseudo-son by Fredrick Barbarossa (Holy Roman Emperor). This is due to Baudolino's charm and ability to spin a yarn and manipulate. The book takes place at the end of Baudolino's life when he tells his story to a historian from Constantinople in an attempt to immortalise himself and make sense of his life.<br />Like Eco's other books, this one contains a plethora of historical information. Here, the scene is mainly Italy's faction states, Paris and the east (Constantinople). However the book's mystical geography (ain't there always one in Eco's novels?) is concerned with the kingdom of Prester John. In the middle ages, he was believed to have been a benevolent Christian king with a kingdom in the east that was about to help liberate Jerusalem from the Muslims from the other front. Baudolino and his friends spend decades obsessing over that kingdom. They pore over arcane documents, make conjectures and finally go in search of the land.<br />Part of Baudolino's specialties is lies. He lies to everyone but believes his lies to be for the sake of a greater good, which they often turn out to be. His simple, no nonsense approach with Barbarossa is what earns him a place as his adopted son. What makes the book interesting is the way in which it describes how his fabrications were behind some famous historical events and ideas of the time.<br />The main flaw of this book compared to Eco's others is the ending. Rose and Pendulum had I thought tied loose ends brilliantly - some questions were answered unexpectedly, others left open and the result was an amazing yearning to make sense of a beautiful story. In this book, I didn't find the final revelations as profound. Therewas a giant question mark as to Baudolino's lies that I thought would make the book brilliant if dealt with - but it was a disappointment. To say more would spoil the book.<br />Still it's a very enjoyable read and thoroughly recommended to Eco/medieval/Prester John/Barbarossa buffs.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Everything about The Lord Of The Rings:The Return Of The King was better the soundtrack,story,and the game. I would highly recomend this game! 5 stars I loved the movie and every night I fall asleep in 5 minuts because the music is so emotinal and creative its like not happy or sad its a great feeling.<br />Anyone who dosen't like the Lord of the rings is crazy.If I could have one cd this would be it! Its so much better then I thought it would be. Howard shore is now my favorite composer. <br />His music was absoulotly perfect and I think the music makes 79% of the movie. I don't think John Williams could have pulled this off as good as Howard Shore. Well done.
0385504209|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  It's entertaining, educating and incredibly thought-provoking.  I definitely recommend this to anyone!!!  I can't wait to read another Dan Brown book!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I already have the non-extended version on DVD. Is it worth getting it? I love the series but im not sure if its worth it. And I dont even know if their going to make another special edition DVD. If you think I should or shouldent buy it email me. Sorry to Amazon if im not aloud to put my email punchdoll2003@yahoo.com!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Linkin Park since the very very beginning ever since i heard their first song on live 105. i have every cd and they cease to amaze me on how good of a band they are. Meteora is the epitome of a brilliant album with extraordinary lyrics and beats. Chester Bennington's voice is astounding and makes the band who they are. Its very hard for me to pick which song is ma favorite on this cd but with thought i'd have to say &quot;Numb.&quot; Rating this cd and the songs individually i would give each a 10 out of 10. Any true rock fan would indeed enjoy this cd.
B00005NKKZ|3.0|All 5 of their studio albums are essential.  This is a very good album but my favorite is still their Bookends (a masterpiece).  This album is slightly uneven with the classic track &quot;The Boxer&quot;.  The title track (although many consider that their opus) misses the boat with me as it's too over-produced/over-orchestrated although the harmony section in the middle is good.  Uneven tracks include a live dull version of &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;, &quot;Baby Driver&quot;, &quot;Keep the Customer satisfied&quot; and &quot;Why don't you write me&quot; and the irritating &quot;Cecilia&quot;.  The good tracks being &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;, &quot;The only living boy in NY&quot;, &quot;Song for the asking&quot; and &quot;So long Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.  <br />Of course, &quot;The Boxer&quot; is worth the price of the album alone.  A somewhat disappointing Swan Song since their previous 2 albums were much better (and a better place to start).  Never-the-less, still essential for the good tracks alone.
B00004T9UF|3.0|couple of dope cuts thats it i have nothing to say bout this man other then he should leave the game<br />7 of 10 lyrics 7.5 of 10 beats
B00005NKKY|5.0|This is a great album.  First few listens may not do much but hang in there.  It gets better.  Much better.  Worth the price alone for the bookends suite on side one.  Of all of their studio releases, this is by far the most cohesive effort.  The 3 hits on this album &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; remind us of a time of what was once good and innocent.  &quot;Old friends&quot; and the &quot;Bookends&quot; theme is just a timeless classic.  I challenge you to listen to the lyrics and NOT get choked up.  If you don't get choked up, try and listen to it again when you're about 40 years of age.  &quot;Voices of Old People&quot; may appear to be filler (ie, just recordings of various conversations amongst old people that Garfunkel recorded at nursing homes) but it precedes the Bookends suite and becomes an important aggregate to the meaning of the suite.  Very melancholy and an essential classic which perhaps exceeds anything done by the Beatles in the same vein.  No, I change my mind.  It goes further than anything the Beatles did.<br />Side B contains independent (although very good) tracks with &quot;Punky's Dilema&quot; being a catchy tune (and fun to play on guitar).   <br />Some people may make fun of those who like Simon and Garfunkel.  Perhaps it's due to their name which sounds &quot;uncool&quot; per se.  It don't matter as Simon and Garfunkel are one of the best duo singer/songwritter combinations ever and just as important/essential to the 60's/70's singer/songwritter generation as any Beatles, Rolling Stones, James Taylor, Eagles, etc...   <br />I dare you to listen to &quot;Old Friends/Bookends&quot; and see if it does not hit a sensitive soft-spot in your heart &amp; soul.  If not now, it will come back to haunt you when you're in your 60's &amp; 70's.  Easily one of the most moving 5-6 minutes in music history.  The simple sounding accoustic Bookends theme is quite possibly one of the most moving littlepieces to play on the accoustic guitar.  Simply a brilliant/geniously-made album.  One of the best albums ever.

The lengthy personal interviews of those involved brought new light to the infantry/paratrooper's plight during WWII.

B0000VAFO0|4.0|Blended in the formats of Blade and The Matrix comes &quot;Underworld&quot;. The movie suprized me as I had no idea of what it was about. Basically Vamps and Werewolves(Lycans) have been fighting each other since time began but, never were the stakes as High as in this final attack. A beautiful vampire belonging to the &quot;Death Dealers&quot; squad kills werewolves. She fights her way through the movie in a skin tight black rubber suit which hugs her curves like a second skin. Time and time again the camera pans her beautiful body as she stares at us with eyes that would mesmerize any man. Alomg the way falls in love with a special human the lycans want very badly. So the romance and war are on. The action scenes and story are relatively good and I thought the movie on the whole was good. There is more story to the movie than you might think while there is also action aplently.

B000001ELB|5.0|I came into my own at the same time that KISS was just starting to dominate the airwaves, so I can recall hearing just about every single track on this cd when it was a new release. <br />Years later in my profession as a classic rock radio dj, this cd is invaluable to me and these timeless tracks come alive once again over the air. <br />Some of the material has been tweaked just a little, although most remains true to the original. &quot;Black Diamond&quot; has been remastered, and differs from it's original release version (but still rocks!). But overall, this is a great collection of their earlier tracks and a must to have along on road trips!  <br />&quot;Double Platinum&quot; is a nicely assembled cd of KISS material for the price.  Rock on!
B00005R2M3|4.0|I really like this album, because she produce the hole CD wisch is more than I can say for so many \\" stars \\" out there.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Words just can't do justice to the series. If is fantastic. It is a wonderful mix of Sci-Fi and the classic western. The &quot;ray-guns&quot; and odd aliens are almost entirely missing. It isn't really the settings that make the show, it is the characters. The drama, humor and action are virtually without parallel. The DVD set would be an excellent buy at twice the price.

0375758992|5.0|Fuller has captured the sadness of ordinary people caught in the mayhem caused by shortsighted politicians - of whatever hue. Her book is refreshingly honest (being PC doesn't mean being truthful), self-critical and above all entertaining, indeed downright funny as well as being poignant in its evocation of people ill-adapted to a changing world. A brilliant book which I cannot recommend more highly.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|well i have always enjoyed all of Britney's videos that i watch on tv, but really i barely hear her songs on the radio.<br />Yes, i must admit her music is just fun, plain and simple, but you see and hear enough of her to just get sick of her! Specially with all those stupid stunts she has pulled lately.<br />Yes, i admit that i wish i had her bank account, but what can we say, i am not her.<br />But I don't understand is people, why do we keep giving all these people (Britney, movie stars and rappers) our hard earned money?<BR>I watch those tv shows on how Britney has a famulous life and how she spends her millions, doesn't that make you sick?<br />People should wake up and realize that the enterteinment industry is just there to squeeze the most money out of us as they can in any way possible, and Britney is the #1 example.<br />I respect artists who actually write their own stuff. As Shakira, she is the best example of that from the pop standpoint - her lyrics might not be the best, but at least are her own.<BR>If Britney wrote her own stuff, she wouldn't be where she is today, I can guarantee that.<br />I gave this cd 2 stars because is just \\"FUN\\" music to listen to, I don't appreciate it for the talent, just for enjoyment it provides - happy, upbeat music, that's it. <BR>I don't go and disect lyrics for the sex talk or for the crashed relationships she might have had.<br />Yes, I must say that her \\"sexiness\\" is the only thing that keeps her afloat....? <br />People like Britney, otherwise she would have been long forgotten years ago. So what if she is a product of greedy music producers? if you don't like her music, don't buy it, if you love it, go buy it and enjoy. Just remember she's the one who's getting richer, not you.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I came across Josh Groban by accident, but by the time that I had heard his first cd I was hooked. I just love his voice, after listening to his entire cd on MSN, I knew that I had to buy this one. By the way, thanks MSN, you certainly made my workday go by easier and faster! My favorite songs on the cd are Remember When It Rained and You Raise Me Up, although I love them all. I also recommend Mario Frangoulis, his voice is gorgeous too.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Fans of the Tomb Raider games may grumble at the change in Lara's character.  In the original game, she had been ostracized by her family after her survival of a crash.  In the movie, she is a much-loved daughter, but orphaned.  But it still works.<br />The key to the games is problem solving.  In the movie, much of the problem solving is done off-screen so that it almost seems like Lara has all of the solutions already memorized.<br />A planetary conjunction is at the heart of the story.  The conjunction is the only time when the pieces of a fabulous device from an ancient civilization may be found.  An organization known as the Illuminati (based on the real group) is after the device.  Lara is sucked in when she uncovers a key her father left her.<br />The story travels the globe with lavish sets and more action than most.  From start to finish the action almost never stops and the story remains fairly true to the spirit of the games.<br />The disk comes packed with plenty of extras; deleted scenes, commentary, making of, effects, music video, etc.  Of course some of the making of information is untrue (obvious if you followed any of the stories during the making of the film), but are still fun to watch.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence sings from the heart.  This is an excellent CD the music is kinda of Gothic.  I had my doubts when I first got this CD, few women can handle this music genre, but she does an excellent job.  I have also seen her in concert and she is just as good.
B000066NW0|3.0|I have somewhat of a love/ hate point of view when it comes to Avril Lavigne and her music. On one hand I really like her songs, &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;I'm with you&quot; - &quot;Sk8erBoi&quot; is okay. I don't like the rest at all. I also like the fact that she managed to make her dreams come true at such a young age.<br />Yet on the otherhand, she is really shooting herself in the foot by putting down some of the hottest artists and music and I'm sure she's feeling the heat somewhat. And sadly, all of the rumors that she is fake, that she doesn't play the guitar, can't write, can't skate and so forth, are all somewhat true.<br />In short she has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing more. It would kinda suck if she were just a one hit wonder and faded away into history at such a young age. I think that she should respect her peers though, in order to avoid rough waters.

0385504209|2.0|Brown's *The Da Vinci Code* mixes the holy-grail story with shallow, web-based research on symbolism, iconology, paganism, early Christianity, and historical tidbits of certain historically significant places in London and Paris.  His structure is choppy, and he seems to lift his prose from other sources.  Consider the following excerpt from his book (p. 395):<br /><br />\\"Westminster Abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church.  It bears the classification of royal peculiar, subject only to the sovereign.\\"<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"Neither a cathedral nor a parish church, Westminster Abbey is a 'royal peculiar' under the jurisdiction of a Dean and Chapter, subject only to the Sovereign.\\"<br /><br />One can only guess how many other such examples pervade the book.  Very disappointing.
0553382179|5.0|I love this book. It was great. It has totally changed my life.  I now consider myself a flybaby. Everyone looking for a routine to keep that house,your family and most of all yourself organized and decluttered must read.
B00000JCOV|1.0|seriously. this band sucks. what do they think they are doing writing music for other people to hear? I honestly do not know why people listen to that noise and claim it is music. I heard a Slipknot song one time, and i swear before my eardrums started bleeding that I heard an ape schreeching and a 2 year old playing on pots and pans. That is just how bad it is. And not only is the band terrible. But they are most likely retarded too. Their lead singer or someone, who really cares, said that if you hit him in the face with a baseball bat he would laugh. ya know what i think, i think you would be dead, not laughing then are you slipknot? they also say that their dj starts hating people when oxygen enter his skull so instead he wears a gas mask. first of all, only crappy \\"nu metal\\" bands have djs. second of all, you need oxygen to live you stupid morons. have you not heard of hemoglobin? its what carries oxygen in your red blood cells. are you trying to tell me it doesnt exsist, because if you are your stupider then i thought. Also, OXYGEN MASKS ONLY LET IN OXYGEN ... YOU! you ... people. why do people listen to them talk? doesnt it make your brain hurt to listen to these morons? i know it hurts mine<br />in conclusion, slipknot are a bunch of stupid morons with no talent.....and they only wear the masks so that people cant recognize them in real life and kill them.
B00008PW2D|2.0|Yes the viewing of this season was good but where are the other episodes?? I fell like I was just ripped off. I am not at all happy with this and would let everyone know it is not worth the price for 8 episodes.. You got me this time.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|To whoever said that Britney Spears can't carry a tune, seriously, get your head checked. Except two songs in 'In the Zone' (Shadow and Everytime) she does not show her vocal ability here. If you've listened to the ballads in her previous albums, you'll see that she's an excellent singer with a poor voice. <BR>Xtina has a good voice and Britney doesn't. But yet both of them have come up with successful albums. <BR>She is not a sex symbol. Oops I did it again and Baby one more time had no sex lyrics and the videos had nothing to do with sex. They are her best selling albums to date. Just because she doesn't have a good voice doesn't mean she can't sing. Give her a break. Her excellent beats and dance moves make up for it. Her tunes are quite different and very creative. Let's hear any one of you come with a tune half as good as her stuff.<BR> The CD doesn't catch your attention too much when you listen to it for the first or second time. You will discover the real music when you listen to it about three or four times. The beats are very catchy and the tunes are fun and dancy. The lyrics aren't exceptional and that's one thing apart from the voice Britney can't beat Christina at. But they're decent enough and some of the lyrics are pretty good. <BR>The best songs off the album are Toxic, Everytime, Breathe on me, Shadow, Showdown, Outrageous, Brave new girl, Me against the music and Touch of my hand in the order I like them. The hook up is extremely catchy and something Britney's never done before. Boom Boom is nice and groovy but the Ying Yang twims are too loud and so unwanted. Early Morning is a big failure and you'll start liking it after listening to it like for ten times (I think you just get used to it) Moby's such a big loser and I hope Britney never works with him again. R.Kelly's stuff (Outrageous) is catchy and upbeat with a cool background beat. Toxic is Britney's 2nd single and very addictive. It's got this 60s/70s thing to it. Everytime is a haunting ballad and the best song Britney's written so far. I think it's the next single after Toxic. Showdown has got great beats and Breathe on me is a hot song which is going to be a single. Shadow and Brave new girl are songs that could've been in the 'Britney' album. <BR>This CD is worth it. Though I'll admit I like her old stuff better, it's great to listen to some dancy fresh stuff from her. I'm sure this is something for hiphop and rnb fans. Britney's got about 5 songs for her old fans and the rest of them are for her anti-fans. <BR>I respect her determination. She's the artist with the most critics and also the most fans. This is something new from her  though this album cannot cover her poor vocals like her old ones did. It's your choice to buy it. You could give it a try beacuse there seems to be something here for everyone. It's like a Hybrid of music.
B000003S09|5.0|In 1969 rock music was coming to a zenith, soaring higher, breaking boundries.  No one was ready for this. King Crimson 's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\"ended the 60's and heralded in the 70's.  Up there with \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Pawn Hearts\\" this record is one for the ages. It trandsends time itself. So beautiful and wonderous. It will go down in the anals of rock music history. \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" blows away all hard rock of that ers. \\"I talk to the Wind\\" was the first real spacy flute passage at that time. \\"Epitah\\" is by far the most beautiful song bringing you to tears. YOU WILL BE CRYING after hearing this.!!!!!!!!!!! Side 2 is aslo special. Just 2 tracks but wow! \\"Moonchild\\" and the tilte track are very intense indeed! The 30th anniversary edition is remastered with an booklet of old pictures to let you see how Greg lake and fripp looked in 1969, young and beautiful. A GREAT , GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!!
B00005NWM3|5.0|I'm sure most of the 350+ reviews were written around the time this album was in peak period.  I think most people get irritated when an artist they like gets so much radio play and thus they get way too negative. <br />This album is great music.  I think Chad Kroeger's voice fits the style perfectly.  Now that I don't hear these songs on the radio every five minutes I have an even greater appreciation for them when I put this disc in my CD Player.  For now the new song &quot;Someday&quot; off Nickelback's new album &quot;The Long Road&quot; is getting quite a bit of radio play but it's ok because THAT song is really a deep and wonderful song.  I could listen to it repeatedly and still be satisfied.  It's a great song for hopping on the motorcycles and listening to it in the mountains while hanging out with your friends.  <br />Nickelback gives off a great vibe and although this may not be Nickelback's best album, please don't label these Candaian rockers as &quot;Alternative Country Music&quot; because they are far from it.  Just gather your friends, chill out, and have a good time.. That's what Nickelback's music does best.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|This is a very disturbing movie & not one that I'd care to see willingly ever again. When it was over I just had an empty feeling & felt as though I may have just possibly wasted a couple hours of my life. Not sure why so many people love this movie. I watched it because a friend of mine went on & on about how fantastic & shocking it was. I didn't find it shocking...just blah. I give it 2 stars because the acting was very well done & the storyline wasn't weak just not my kind of thing. Ellen Burstyn kind of got on my nerves too about 1/4 into the movie.
B0000TB04G|1.0|This critique doesn't allow minuses or this would be a huge one, minus infinity.  Her music is bland.  She is a twit.  She is fake country and gives the genre a bad name.  The music industry is in trouble because of so-called artists like Shania Twain, Garth Brooks, Brittany Spears and the like.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Doesn't it seem odd that a show that failed would be put on DVD?  I thought so too, but I kept hearing good things about Firefly, and I am big fans of Joss Whedon's other shows, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, so I decided to see what it was like.  I couldn't be happier that I did because Firefly is definitely a great show that was killed before it could even begin to reach its full potential.  The show tells the story of nine people on the firefly class ship Serenity, which was named for a battle in a war for independence.  This battle was, for the most part, the last stand for Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his fellow Independents.  After this fight, victory seemed imminent for the Alliance, a government who wanted to unite all planets under one rule.   Mal and his friend and later first mate Zo (Gina Torres) wanted each planet to rule itself.  After the war, the pair bought Serenity and assembled a crew consisting of Wash (Alan Tudyk), the pilot and Zo's future husband, Kaylee (the beautiful Jewel Staite), the cheerful mechanic who definitely has elements of the Buffy character Willow (the also beautiful Alyson Hannigan), and Jayne (Adam Baldwin), who is kind of muscle for hire.  They also have Inara (Moreena Baccarin), who is a companion, which is the new term for prostitute.  Apparently, 500 years from now, prostitution will not only be legal, but it will be a respectful career.  She rents one of Serenity's two shuttles, and her presence is mutally beneficial to the crew and herself.  Her clientele is increased, and she opens some doors for Mal and the crew.  In fact, her nickname is the Ambassador.  The group will do anything to keep going; they will pick up passengers and do any job, legal or illegal.  Mal actually seems to prefer the illegal jobs just because it means thwarting the Alliance.  Then in the first episode (strangely, it was the one of the last ones aired), three new people join the crew.  There is Shepard Book (Ron Glass), thepreacher and conscious of the ship, Dr. Simon Tam, and his insanely intelligent and intelligently insane (yes I know, that didn't make much sense) sister.  Simon and River are on the run from the Alliance; River, who is a genius, was sent to an academy run by the Blue Sun Corporation, which is heavily funded by the Alliance.  However, the acadamy turned out to be a lab facility where researchers did experiments on River.  She sent coded messages to Simon, and he had her cryogenically frozen, and then resuced her.  Now Mal and the crew have to deal with a crazy young girl who is a wanted fugitive.  The writing and acting on the show are definitely worthy of Joss Whedon's name; in fact, after Firefly ended, Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres were cast in Buffy and Angel.  I loved this cast, especially Jewel Staite.  She was priceless!  I was so afraid that she was going to die in the first episode, and I was very relieved when she wasn't.  However, her situation allowed for one of the best scenes in the entire series; the thing that happened when Mal told Simon that she was dead was so funny.  Some of my favorite episodes include Serenity Pts. 1 and 2, The Train Job, Shindig, Ariel, Our Mrs. Reynolds, Trash, The Message, War Stories, and Objects In Space.  Oh, and speaking of characters in Joss Whedon's shows, did you see that, in Serenity, Carlos Jaccot, who played Dobson, also appeared as villains in Buffy and Angel (although in Angel, he wasn't really evil, despite the fact that he was a demon who wanted to eat Doyle's (Glenn Quinn) brains).  Unfortunately, we may never know how much some of these characters will be developed.  In fact, there are so many things that we may never know; such as Book's origins; something was up with him.  He could shoot too well, and the bounty hunter, who may have been a little crazy, said without any doubt that he was no Shepard.  We also may never know what those blue-handed men from the Blue Sun actually did to River, and what they wanted her for.  The Simon/Kaylee and Mal/Inara relationships will never be fulfilled/revealed/destroyed, and we won't find out if Inara actually leaves.  I really hope that the Firefly movie gets made, so that we can see what happens next.  I would also like Fox to revive the show, the way that they are reviving Family Guy, because they lost a true gem when they cancelled Firefly.    Update  As of August 7th, 2004, I have shown Firefly to four people who, like me had never seen it before.  All of them are now big fans who are angry that the show was cancelled, and are waiting for April 2005 for the movie.
0385504209|4.0|I knew Dan Brown with &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is similar in its action and structure. I liked both books because they combine fiction with history and an excellent description of museums, churchs and other esoteric/historical landmarks.<br />If you are looking for a literary book, this is not. HOwever, if you are looking for an excellent thriller, intelligent and very well written, this is the book.<br />In fact, I want to read Brown's previous books.
B000001Y2U|5.0|In 1996, when Marilyn Manson became a common voice on the radio, I initially thought he was a woman. I was not only offended by him, but classified him as one of the strangest humans in the world second only to the modern day Michael Jackson. <br />Speaking of MJ, his Off the Wall-Thriller era must have influenced Manson somehow. The critics always claimed NIN industrial arranger /  singer Trent Reznor to be the driving force behind this record, but in most Nine Inch Nails videos, Trent would grab his crotch (an obvious Jackson rip off). Maybe Trent was the inspiration but this Manson release marks what should be considered the first fully-realized, honest, and pure MM band collaborative record. <br />&quot;The Anitchrist Superstar&quot; is a Dark, Torturesque Album, Depressed industrial metal masterpiece. Such is the sort of intgrity Love-Gun era Kiss would appreciate. There is some kind of theme here too. This is a great thing since Manson was beginning to use his wide palette of darkness. He did so more rickly than anything found on 1994's &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; or 95's &quot;Dope Hat&quot; EP.<br />Amidst the success coming off of &quot;Portrait&quot; in early 96', Brian Warner . . . I mean Marilyn Manson, got to meet his idol Gene Simmons, at a party. He also met many &quot;foolish&quot; guests who he presumed to be living an unncessarily greedy, spoiled, and glossed up life. <br />This is where &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; arose from.<br />Irresponsible Hate anthem seems to continue where NIN's The Downward Spiral's &quot;march of the pigs&quot; left off. I believe once again, Vrenna is the chosen drummer and drum fast and loud is exactly what it feels like. <br />Tourniquet, is a hate soaked vent for pain as Manson almost wants to be the punching bag for the ones who hate him.<br />Man that you Fear seems like Manson is trying to scare the one he is close to, namely his girlfriend. It is more mopey though than scary.<br />This is simply a must for fans of groundbreaking controversial albums.
0780020685|5.0|Defining the \\"best movie ever made\\" is very subjective, and the hype generated by such praise often gives viewers expectations that a single movie cannot hope to satisfy. Akira Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" is one of the rare movies in that it is universally praised and admired by film scholars and casual views alike. Though I will claim that this is indeed the best movie ever made, it is near the top of my list, and I firmly believe that it deserves every inch of the hype. And it also goes without saying that the Criterion DVD is the only way to go.<br />Despite the long running time, the story is surprisingly easy to follow. A group of poor villagers, impoverished by constant attacks by bandits, hire a group of ronin samurai to defend their village from the impending attacks. The main character is played by Kurosawa staple Toshiro Mifune, playing the misfit of the samurai group who carries the large sword over his shoulder, and can convey his thoughts without even opening his mouth. Also putting their best feet forward are several prominent Japanese actors of the day, many of whom went on to star in future Kurosawa pictures. The battle scenes, many of which take place towards the latter quarter of the movie, are masterfully choreographed and filmed, despite the low budget of the film. Also ahead of it's time was Kurosawa's camera trickery, such as the fading, the deep focus, and trademark use of weather and lighting conditions to accentuate the mood of the film (he uses heavy rain to signify hard times for the villagers, for example). For great insight into Kurosawa's technique, listen to the commentary track by Japanese film scholar Michael Jeck.<br />The Criterion DVD is not as full-featured as other Criterion DVDs, but this is probably due to the lack of archival material. The only real extra of note is the aforementioned commentary. It is as informative as DVD commentaries get, though so much information is given that you might be tempted to take notes. Michael Jeck is obviously an expert on the subject of not only Japanese movies, but the culture and history, and he gives plenty of side information on Japanese customs and samurai traditions. Most interesting is how he points out many nuances in Kurosawa's filming style. You will walk away with a new appreciation for the movie after hearing the commentary. On the technical side, the print is better than any previously released, and miles better than the discounted \\"Region Free\\" copies floating around. Though there is a bit of grain in the darker shots, for the most part the print is excellent.<br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is a bona fide classic, and one that deserves all the praise it receives. It never feels dated, and the use of comedy, action, and drama ensures that sitting through the 3 ½ hours is enjoyable, rather than an endurance trial. The Criterion release, with the quality transfer and the excellent commentary, is the best way to experience it. Also recommended from Kurosawa are \\"Ikiru\\", \\"Hidden Fortress\\", and \\"Yojimbo\\", and all are available from Criterion Collection.Jeck is obviously an expert on the subject of not only Japanese movies, but the culture and history, and he gives plenty of side information on Japanese customs and samurai traditions.

6304698690|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movies.  It is about the need to feel wanted and it is about living.  This is a beautiful story about children who find life in a garden and themselves in each other.  Anyone who adores stories about how fragile we humans are and how much we need one another (and how much good we can do for one another) will love this movie.  I find no fault with it.  It is all about HOPE.  (And I do not think the chanting and dream sequence is odd: the most spiritual of us do not close our minds and hearts.)
B00005UKKF|5.0|Britney's a horrible singer but damn she can put on a show! This DVD was amazing and had me watching the entire time. Worth every penny.
1400049628|5.0|I can already tell from some of the bad reviews that people are missing the whole point of this book. First this book is supposed to sound serious and that's the beauty of it. It's lack of suipposed humor is what makes it truly hilarious. I mean we all know that zombies aren't real...so why take the subject so seriously? The book details everything from a zombies' senses and how they react to how to survive in a world ruled by the shambling dead. Max Brooks even came up with an entirely FALSE historical accounts of various outbreaks, some with I found more amusing that a large number of zombie films. I have to commend how Brooks  makes a subject so ridculious seem so real. I definitely have to recommend this book for any writer concidering writing a zombie story or zombie movie fan.
B0000DD7LC|2.0|I had very high hopes with regards to this cd, especially after hearing her stellar first single &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, but upon receiving and listening to it, I don't really like it.  It's painfully boring to me, even though it has some nice songs on it.  Songs In A Minor was a much better cd.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Bravo Howard Shore. Very few musical scores are so evocative, so emotional, so complex, or so successful. The sheer power of this score will just overwhelm you, specifically, track 3-Minas Tirith, track 4-The White Tree, and track 17-The Return of the King. It's wonderful that Shore was given such a healthy budget to recruit some of the best classical musicians, both Renee Fleming's haunting soprano and James Galway's spirited and lush flute playing add so much to an already outstanding film score. I can honestly think of no better resolution to any trilogy. Bravo to the London Philharmonic for all of their work on all three films and making this very difficult and overwhelming score into pure beauty. And I don't care what these other reviewers have to say about Annie Lennox, I listen to nothing but orchestral and choral classical music and I still think her voice is absolutely perfect for Howard Shore's, Into the West, an absolutely beautiful and powerful closing song to an amazing trilogy. Some people have noted that you don't hear the themes from the first two films that much in this score,  you hear variations and little tastes of them throughout the picture, which is true. Howard Shore moves into a lot of new territory for this score and includes the other themes only where they are appropriate. The whole idea of the film is that every single one of these little cultures that had their own music and own way of doing things is now part of something bigger and greater, they are no longer just Rohan, Gondor, Bree, the Dunedain, or hobbit, they are a much larger version of the fellowship that we saw in the first book. Howard Shore illustrates this magnificently and clearly, showing that he has grasped and understood the book and the films and where the music should fit in to the story. I can't think of a better score except for maybe John Williams' Harry Potter which is tied for my favorite along with the LOTR music. There is now another great composer besides Williams who knows how to use the symphony orchestra to make such beautiful film music. Believe me, the works of Horner and Zimmer pale in comparison to this monumental achievement. Buy this soundtrack I dont care if you listen to rap, death-metal, baroque or jazz there is something in here for everyone. Highest Recommendation.
034537410X|5.0|First, I must state that I want to give this book more around 4 1/2 stars, but I mine as well round up. <br />If you are starting to become interrested in lucid dreaming, I HIGHLY recommend that you order or pick up this book. It has techniques for becoming lucid and tips for what to do when you're lucid. Along with that, the book has ways for lucid dreaming to further improve your life, beyond the aspect of just having fun. <br />However, I wanted to give the book 4 1/2 stars for one reason and one reason only. Like other reviews that have stated this, this book totally is without the spirituality that is experienced during a lucid dream and LaBerge's theories on dreams are a solely based on Freud, which may or may not be a good thing, depending how you look at it.<br />Overall, excellent book. If you're looking into lucid dreaming, read this book. Believe me, it will be an incredibly useful tool for you.
B00000ING2|5.0|New York in the late 1950s. Norville Barnes (Robbins) is a nobody who gets a job in the hilariously nightmare-ish mail room of the vast Hudsucker Corporation. But he is ambitious. He has a wild business idea represented by a circle on a piece of paper he is given to waving at people. This of course instantly convinces them they are talking to a moron who has just, quite literally, reinvented the wheel. At it later transpires that is not what he has done. A moron, however, is exactly what the boardroom, led by evil Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), wants. Company founding president Waring Hudsucker has just thrown himself to his death from the top floor and his fellow board members learn that the company rules deem his dominant share in the company stock must be put on sale to the general public in the New Year. If only they could get it to fall so low they could buy it themselves. If only they could hire such an idiot as President that shareholder confidence would collapse. At which point who should walk into Mussburger's office to deliver a letter but Barnes...<br />The result is  quite excellent movie. It's not quite as good as the best of the Coen Brothers later stuff which it often anticipates. Thus it starts out with a voice-over section as the camera sweeps into New York City from a distance, humourously establishing both the place and the central character, that strongly anticipates the opening of \\"Big Lebowski\\". And it's very evidently inspired by a host of earlier classic American movies in much the way \\"Lebowski\\" and \\"Oh Brother\\" were. The ghost of Frank Capra is never very far away. And the most important character I've not yet mentioned, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Amy, the hard boiled journalist who sets out to expose Barnes but ends up as the love interest, is clearly enough based on characters like Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson in \\"His Girl Friday\\". That's another movie this isn't quite as good as. But that again is praising it with faint damnation:most novels, including some great ones, aren't as good as \\"Mansfield Park\\"! And this is a truly splendid film, a really excellent, beautifully written and extremely funny movie that deserves to be better known.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Hatebreeder is the Children of Bodem album to buy. It contains some of the greatest dual keyboard-guitar passages along with intense classical melodies. They clearly can play their instruments which is more than can be said about 99% of the commercial metal community which COB are not a part of. The best song is either Silent Nite... or Children of Bodem, one of the greatest 5 minutes captured. Although they have now sold out, Hatecrew Deathroll, this is the COB that all have come to love and an essential in any metal collection.
B0000BWVBD|3.0|With so many movies based in comic books these days, originality is something that doesnt seem to be appearing much. Most of those movies are formulaic, predictable and action-oriented. &quot;Hulk&quot;, at least, tries to be different, gives the characters some time to develop and even has a story to tell. Director Ang Lee builds a superhero-drama and slowly introduces the tension, conflict and pain that define the green giant. Eric Bana gives a convincing performance as the nervous and reserved Bruce Banner, developing his inner fight between sanity and madness. Although the movie is well acted and directed, it doesn`t show most of the trademarks of a typical and bland blockbuster, so it failed to convince a big part of the audiences. That`s unfortunate, since it has an intriguing dark atmosphere, grabbing the viewer and creating a tense mood. Yet, it gets slow in some moments, an runs for too long (2h15m). <BR>&quot;Hulk&quot; is a good comic book adaptation and one of the best summer films of 2003, howevewer it`s not for everyone and requires some patience. The tone and overall feel of the movie is similar to that in &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, making for an interesting double-feature.
0066620996|4.0|Collins and his assembled team examine companies that have existed and then developed a focused cultural meme that propelled them from surviving (in some cases profitably) to excelling. This surge is measured by the stock's appreciation relative to the overall market and specific companies that are in the same industry. Is this the most significant way to measure a company's performance? It may well be if you are attempting to do it over many years, as Collins does. Unfortunately, it precluded his examination of non-publicly traded companies.<br />He creates some new jargon to describe how this focused meme manifests itself in the examined companies. If learning this new parlance bores you, you will have a tough slog ahead. However there is much of value here. The methods and tools of adherence to a metric that is at the essence of the company are described in rich detail. It is possible to take this and replicate it at any size company or organization.<br />I won't repeat the description of the ideas in the book that some of the other reviewers have exposed. I will commend this title to those who would like to learn how to propel their organizations to a higher level.
B00003CWL5|3.0|This is not that new. It`s just an independent movie overhyped to the extreme. It`s not that challenging, either, since \\"Fight Club\\" did this kind of stuff much better, and earlier. Not to say it`s bad, since there are some good elements to find here. The direction by Sam Mendes was creative enough but not stellar. The acting was appropriate although some characters seemed like caricatures straight out of \\"Daria\\". The plot, a bit unbalanced and sometimes went over the top. Ok, it`s a dark comedy but that ending is neither dark nor comic and just doesn`t fit with the rest of the story. Despite this flaws, it still works as an observation of today`s american society (is it just about the american?) and is another worthwile indie view of the calm, monotonous suburbs.
B000000HXK|2.0|I thought the music sounded great on my home theater setup. I just couldn't deal with the vocals - this guy can't sing. I'd be interested to hear what these guys are up to now... and if they got a different singer.
B00000634L|3.0|This record is difficult to review. Bran Van 3000 create interesting, original music, melting a lot of diverse styles in one album. &quot;Glee&quot; combines pop, hip hop, rock, electronica, country and easy listening (I probably forgot something), and as a whole is works as an unique, weird, flawed yet addictive effort. Each song here is quite different from one another, the band has male and female vocalists and at times there are some filler moments. When it`s good, it`s really good, like the lo-fi pop of &quot;Problems&quot;, the absorbing &quot;Rainshine&quot; or the chaos presented in &quot;Forest&quot;. &quot;Old School&quot;, &quot;Willard&quot; and &quot;Mama Don`t Smoke&quot;, however, would do better as b-sides. <BR>&quot;Glee&quot; is an eclectic mix, a bit too long and pointless at parts but with enough moments of brilliance to make it a recommended debut of the late 90`s. 3,5 stars.
0312995423|1.0|Unfortunately, Amazon does not let you give a 0 star rating...<BR>I agree with most of the other reviewers who gave this book a low star rating. I have read his other books and really liked them all. This book is the worst of his writing and seems to have been released without verifying many of facts on computer security issues that are well-known to an average software engineer. This book seems to have been used as an opportunity to cash in on Dan Brown's successes with his other novels DVC and A&amp;D, both of which are a good read. This book is really an insult to an average software engineer's intelligence. Perhaps the author's assumption is that the readers are less intelligent as the characters in the novel. Full of predictable scenarios and plots, boring and thin dialogues, clumsy plot, characters without any dimensions or intelligence, incredibly vague and inaccurate. If you want waste your time (like me :-( ...regretful now) by reading this, go ahead. I will be careful in buying future works of this author though.
B000077VT7|2.0|With so many meaningless action movies nowadays, most of them are just pieces of fight sequences glued with weak acting and nonexistant plot. &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is not a bad action movie, but never steps above average material either. Matt Damon is ok as the lost Jason Bourne and Doug Liman knows how to make some creative and credible action sequences, but the plot is still typical and not very different from so many other spy films. The predictable ending doesn`t help, either. <BR>While it is moderately entertaining, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; never achieves that &quot;something&quot; that could make it a must-see. A well-made product, but not much else. Let`s wait for the sequel.
B00005JMCN|1.0|To start, the director did a horrible job of making the film interesting. Sure, there is an under-dog winning in the end. I have seen plenty of uplifting films. The problem is almost everything is predictable to a point of nonsence.<br />We see the guy watch the chick undress. His vision blurs. I wonder how that will affect his racing... We see a boy driving up a hill with a car coming in the opposite direction. Could they collide? We see Seabiscuit running on a track. Ironically, two men are fixing a very large tractor or somethin directly next to the track. Perhaps something will happen! We see Jeff Bridges looking for a guy to look after sea biscuit. I wonder who that man could be? We see in the papers that there is a horse dominating the races, and Seabiscuit wants to race the horse. I wonder who will win?<br />I just pointed out 5 or so things that are so predictable right when the movie starts. The film is so lifeless that it drags along in my opinion. WHy do I want to watch this movie if I know who will win. The movie has no comedic moments. There are boring stories going on and maybe one good horse race to speak of. Everything else is boring. Predictable, boring, and lifeless. Wonderful!<br />Sadly enough though, many people feel that they are obligated to give this film 5 stars because it is \\"uplifting\\". It is like giving a child a lolli-pop. Don't expect to be blown away because it is obvious he will be happy.
078062369X|1.0|This could have been a good, or even great, comic book adaptation. The beginning promises a lot, with appropriate dark visuals, a well-created and intriguing atmosphere and some well-done action sequences. Sadly, after the first minutes the plot gets derivative and predictable, wretching an interesting and original concept. This urban, futuristic and edgy look at vampires ends up being a letdown, consisting in sequences of random fight scenes with plenty of gore moments, loud music, cardboard characters and campy acting. This is unfortunate, since it has some creative visual elements, which aren`t enough to make it more than a bad b-movie that`s just way too ridiculous to take seriously. It`s not entertaining, either, not even in a so-bad-its-good-way, so the disappointment is even bigger. Innocuous.
B00005JK8K|1.0|The terrible soundtrack, the story, the plot made me remember some of the Old war movies like those with John Wayne, Richard Burton and other famous actors of the same period. Sometimes I even found Nicolas Cage very bad, even laughable. The fights with the Japanese are quite funny..kind of when you think they are all dead, there is more. The end of the movie is laughable. Nicolas Cage carries on his back one of the indian soldiers while the Japanese are shouting all over the place.A scene 10 000 times seen in movies. I will not forget to say that it's full of cliches about honour, pride...They are all real men in this flick and they are all american of course. John Wayne could have been great in this one.
0767849493|1.0|What a worthless, childish and pretentious movie. It`s supposed to be a satire on catholicism, but is such an inane film that I almost felt pity for it. So this is what a hip, clever, witty movie should be nowadays, eh? Well, in fact it`s just a lame mess. The beginning isn`t bad, Damon and Affleck have a couple of entertaining scenes with some black humour, but it doesn`t last for too long and soon falls into mediocrity. The film seems endless and gets worse from scene to scene. In the end, &quot;Dogma&quot; is a failed parody with a few decent moments and a lot of crap. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the acting bland and the direction shows little creativity. While its strange, different and offbeat, it doesn`t qualify as being actually something worthwhile and poignant. A letdown.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw it on Broadway and was so sad when it was over. And I said, how can i relive this wonderful experience? although the cd is not the same as being in a huge theater with funny dialog and cute dances, the cd is great. kristen chenoweth and idina menzel are unbelievable and they are my new idols!!
B00009MEKF|1.0|An average murder story where the plot is about trying to find who killed the members of a special military unit. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get togheter again after &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, but the movie just goes on forever, endlessly...A souless, pointless thriller whose only interesting element is the ending twist, but not even that can save the state of boredom created by the previous moments. A turkey.
0385504209|1.0|Simply the worst-written book I've ever read. Yes, the plot is (just) amusing enough to keep you reading (though pretty implausible), but only at the expense of having your intelligence insulted by the most clich&eacute;-ridden, clumsily-written prose you're ever likely to encounter.<br />Perhaps the rave reviewers don't mind how their entertainment is delivered (just as millions are apparently satisfied with their daily burger), but if you require even the most basic attention to literary style from your reading material, avoid this book like the... um... well, I'm sure Dan Brown would have a suitable expression to use here.
B000003S09|5.0|the first great prog-rock album. with three of the genre's greatest songs &quot; 21st century schizoid man &quot;, &quot;epitaph&quot; and &quot;the court of the crimson king&quot;. while not as good as lark's tounges or red, it is in more of the tradition of the moody blues (the mellotron drenched songs). still not up to par with the best prog rock album of all time  &quot;close to the edge&quot; by yes.
B000007T1M|5.0|This unconventional album defies all tradition, normality, sanity, or reason in music today, and does a damn good job of it. Sure, they are completely psychotic, but their talent still shines in this album. Here's a review:<br />Suite-Pee: 9/10<BR>They open with this tremendous song, both lyrically and musically. The guitar is fantastic, as usual, the bass does a magnificent job of backing it up, and the drums add a catchy beat to the whole thing summing up in a great song. <br />Know: 7/10<BR>Although the lyrics are very strange and nonsensical, Serj delivers them brilliantly. The guitar is slightly below the benchmark set by some of the other tracks, but it is still something to listen to.  <br />Sugar: 8/10<BR>This song is... rather odd. When I said the album was unconventional, this is what I meant. Still, its great and very repeatable, and the close is just wonderful. <br />Suggestions: 8/10<BR>Although this song is probably the second wierdest on the entire album, System Of A Down pulls off being strange with excellence. I love the guitar, especially at the instrumental part near the end.<br />Spiders: 10/10<BR>Wow. Where to start. I could give this album 4 stars just for having this song on it. The vocals are fantastic. The guitarist shows real talent here. Its no wonder this song was a single.<br />DDevil: 6/10<BR>This song is very good and fairly humorous, but too short! Its only about a minute and half long! <br />Soil: 9/10<BR>Great song about sucide. The guitar is magnificent here. I also really like Serj's job with the vocals.<br />War?: 10/10<BR>The lyrics are great, they really have the right formula for a war protest song, and they are delivered with excellence. The guitar, again, is magnificent. It, along with Spiders, would be worth the money just by themselves.<br />Mind: 9/10<BR>Again, very unconventional. Some of my most favorite lyrics ever. The vocals are just so freaking cool, too. I love Serj's scream in this song (Go away! Go away!) and theguitar continues to be great.<br />Peephole: 8/10<BR>By far, the most bizzare song on the album. Its probably one of the top 5 wierdest songs of all time. You can't think of this kind of stuff without being on some kind of drug. Still, its a great song and I can listen to it over and over.<br />Cubert: 6/10<BR>This song is very good, but I simply don't enjoy it that much. I often lose interest while listening. But still, its worth listening to and then some.<br />Darts: 9/10<BR>Very funny in some areas, and totally unpredictable on the first listen. Again, its bizzare, but in a good way. The guitar is flawless.<br />PLUCK (Politically lying, unholy, cowardly killers): 10/10<BR>A song about the Armenian genocide. Its awesome in every way, from start to finish. I could listen to it over and over.<br />I really don't see the big deal about whether its Nu-Metal or Death Metal or whatever. If its good, I listen to it. And this album most definately IS good.

B00005JMTN|5.0|Most children start out their lives idealizing their parents in one way or another, and the pedestals are slowly hacked away, but sometimes a new one is erected. Growing up, Will (Billy Crudup) idealized his father, believing all of his incredible, tall tales of adventure - even including his own dramatic birth.<br />Now in his thirties, married and with a baby of his own on the way, Will must now tie up loose ends with his father who is dying of cancer.  Edward Bloom (as a young man, Ewan McGregor, present day portrayal by Albert Finney) seems to touch success everywhere he goes, not having much himself, but enriching the lives of those around him. His sweet smile and positive outlook make him not only an effective salesman of useless household objects, but a salesman of himself and his &quot;big fish&quot; stories.<br />Disgusted wih his father's apparent allergic reaction to telling a simple fact instead of a tall tale, Will has let 3 years pass without a word between them, but now must face the reality that time is now his worst enemy.  Will finally confronts his father, telling him, &quot;I don't know who you are.&quot; Will leaves in a huff, and going through his father's papers, begins to investigate the truth of his father's past.<br />As Will begins to unravel the tapestry his father has woven, he finds that &quot;not everything (he) has said is a complete fabrication&quot; as his mother (Jessica Lange) tells him... and some of the most unbelievable of his stories turn out to be very true, albeit sometimes a little exaggerated.  Will finds himself turning back into that young, believing child - rebuilding even a bigger pedestal to place his father upon - the opposite of what he expected.<br />It's easy to understand Will's resentment - his own mother, while not telling her own tall tales, never seems to be a voice of reason - expecting a young child to grow up not knowing what is real - her sole focus in life seems to be on her husband, and very little focus is on raising the little human they've created together.<br />Those who have recently lost a loved one may find a poignant scene between the father and son a little too close to home, a truly bittersweet moment of heart-wrenching reconciliation.<br />Lots of light hearted moments and tongue-in-cheek scenes break what little tension the viewer experiences.  Some language a partial nudity make this unsuitable for young viewers, but compared to broadcast television, it is quite tame.s is on raising the little human they've created together.<br />Those who have recently lost a loved one may find a poignant scene between the father and son a little too close to home, a truly bittersweet moment of heart-wrenching reconciliation.<br />Lots of light hearted moments and tongue-in-cheek scenes break what little tension the viewer experiences.

0805062971|5.0|Before you go and see the movie (if you haven't yet) you should probably read the book first. The book is almost always better, but in the book the endings are different, and the character are too, but anyways. <BR>What makes this book so good is how much it can make you realize. As you read this book, you often find how stupid and trivial a lot of your life is. The dark  humor adds a nice touch. Even if you are getting this book, because you need some entertainment, it's still an excellent read, with a higly engrossing plot, and very interesting characters. Palahniuk is an excellent writer and i would recommend this book to anyone.
B00000263T|4.0|Great album. I particularly dislike Udo´s voice, Ithink the band would have achieved greater success if had other vocalist, but Udo was part of theimage of the band, I guess, and was in it since the start.<br />This album is heavy rock at its best. The solos by Hoffmann are incredible, melodic, strong, intense.<br />The lyrics continue to be the weakest point of the band. They are simply awful.<br />After METAL HEART, Accept made a total assault to maisntream radio, with the horrible RUSSIAN ROULETTE, that cretaed incredible internal tension within the band.
B00001QGPS|4.0|The beats on alot of the songs here are totally kickin it!  My faves are Blackout and Tear (the roof) Off.  This is really &quot;hard&quot; rap though.  Raw and abrasive.  No holding back.  But more than anything, it's the beats that I like.  Y.O.U. is a pretty good song too.
B000005JYE|4.0|This is the last studio release containing original material from ABBA, and it dates back to 1982. IT has a top production, very good songs (my favorite is &quot;When All Is Said and Tone&quot;) and deeper lyrics than before, because the band was going through divorce at the time and Ulaveus and Andersson where in a bad mood...<br />Very good.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|Did anyone notice that there is essential dubbing missing or have Fox become politically correct?  In Alien there are two  scenes where the characters of Dallas and Ripley speak but nothing comes out.  Dubbing is missing - can you believe it and at these prices?  Then there is a scene where Parker says 'spit on it for Christ sakes' well, you see his mouth motion 'Christ' but only 'sakes' comes out.<br />Then in Aliens the sound actually sits on top of the film.  Is the track off?  It certainly looks that way because every breath that Ripley takes is larger than life but unfortunately is a beat ahead or behind the action.  <br />Come on guys, don't you know that we movie fans own the VHS tapes before we upgrade to DVD and may even know some of the dialog by heart (yup that means the missing dialog that you didn't include on this disc). I am wholly disappointed that these discs are NOT the same as the VHS.  Its not just the money - we want ALL of the original movies, dubbing, scenes and extras.  Shame on you Fox!  Buyers beware.

B000027822|5.0|I had never heard of Miles Davis before and then I went and got this CD for a test run on my new SACD player and was blown away with the sound quality that it put out you can hear ever pin drum and music sound I've never been so relaxed in my life. I usually listen to the Beatles and Rolling Stones on Hybrid CD's but this just blows it away. I can't wait to listen a second time. But buyers beware this is the real thing, an SACD not the Hybrid CD that can be played on both regular and SACD players.
0743490304|4.0|I gave Deception Point 4 stars because this is my least favorite Dan Brown book of the 4 that I've read.  But this one was almost as engrossing as the others, and had a more scientific bent that some people might really enjoy.
0140187537|5.0|Steinbeck wrote this novel in the days when American Grocery stores were 94% independent single-owned stores. The hero isn't much of a hero, just a man struggling with the pressures of economic success in contrast to his moral beliefs.<br />With over 90% of the grocery stores today being multi-store operations, we see in this book the beginnings of the Madison Avenue economy we live in today, and what has been lost in the process.<br />At least Hawley struggled against the tide, where today it has become almost chic to lack morals, fool consumers, be the trickster guru, or market a ton of air in attractive colors and graphics.<br />Steinbeck shows us it should be a struggle, and indeed it will be a difficult one in a cultural setting where rationalizations (&quot;It's only a crime against money - afterall!&quot;) eat away at the social requirements of honesty, decency, and respect for your fellow men and women.<br />At the end, a symbolic clue leads the reader back to a previous chapter and obscure dialogue. Left to ponder what this really means.
B0000AM6LY|2.0|Nothing ear shattering here on this CD.  The only good song is Sunrise.
0385504209|4.0|I just read the Da Vinci Code this weekend, and enjoyed it thoroughly. However, I just had to share something with other readers who enjoy a good laugh. I tried to email Doubleday, but could find no way to do so, so I'm having my fun here instead. If you check out the first page of the Epilogue of this novel of cryptic messages, you will find the following freudian slip. The hero is at last enjoying  a good hot shower after his many travails in pursuit of the Holy Grail, and the book refers to him enjoying the shower's &quot;message&quot; rather than &quot;massage.&quot; Does it get better than that? So I got to enjoy a final good chuckle as I closed the book. Perhaps someone will find a way to get this info to the publisher. Or, better yet, let's leave it in!
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|The Strokes are like Limp Bizkit, in that people dont see that theyre just a boy band until a couple years after their time.  Dont worry, soon enough theyll be the next Vanilla Ice's of our world.<BR>This is nsync for people too insecure with themselves to admit they're teenybopping superficial nobodies.  These are the same people who call their strokes cd &quot;the new record&quot;, expressing a nostalgia for vinyl, a media they never experienced.  Find other ways to feel grown up, ok lil jonny?<BR>Move over Limp Bizkit, kids like the Strokes now.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I can listen through every track without skipping one.  It's fantastic. I am a huge fan now and am looking forward to their next album.<BR>I only hope they keep with the same style and don't change it up too much. I really enjoy what they're doing.
B000003TA4|1.0|Kurt cobain was worst than avril lavigne.<BR>Read any lyric composed by him. Its just terrible. <BR>Do yourself a favour: go on and buy Exile on main street and listen to REAL MUSIC. Kurt burns in hell now. We all hate you, KUrt. You were a terrible lyricist.
B00005Q2RZ|5.0|I saw an episode of Music in High Places (a great series...but not as popular as TRL-like crap unfortunately) a number of years ago and was really impressed by the artist....but I didn't see the credits.  It drove me crazy for months until I found out that it was Ryan adams live in Jamaica.  I've been a huge fan ever since. <br />His CD, GOLD, is the best music to come out in a decade.  This one should be rated a 5 star classic. Adams reverently wears his influences on his sleeve...you hear Keith Richard's (tastiest)riffs in the Rescue Blues and tinges of the Allman Brothers and Neil Young elsewhere ...but it is the simplcity of pure Ryan Adams in La Cienaga Just Smiled that just blows me away.  The acoustic guitar on the bridge to that song just has to be heard. It is simply beautiful. <br />I told my 13 year old son that I liked Ryan Adams because he was the \\"real deal\\" and not some Counting Crows-like derivitive \\"sounds familiar\\" type artist.  When we went to see the Annie Leibovitz photographs from her book \\"American Music\\", this past weekend at the EMP museum here in Seattle he noticed that along with the photos of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, The North Mississippi All Stars and Iggy Pop , Ryan Adams was chosen as a representative of American Music....  <br />My son walked past photos of Bonnie Rait, Emmylou Harris and B.B. King and said \\"Hey Dad look, Ryan Adams....\\"
B00005Q45W|5.0|Leonard Cohen has again and again written poetry that is timeless, powerful, deeply and intensely profound and most especially poetry that invites the listener into a shared journey of spiritual depths and simple joys.<BR>Profoundly wrapped in paradox, Mr. Cohen's sculptured poems range from the profane to the sacred in his &quot;secret life&quot; and his &quot;rivers running dark.&quot;  Each song is worth the price of admission.  Each song is its own journey into longing and love;  warmth and loneliness, into mystic musings of Zen, the Kabbala and Contemplation. <BR>Whether it is &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep,&quot; or that &quot;You Have Loved Enough,&quot; there is a song for each and every hearer.<BR>Yes, simply stated &quot;Ten New Songs.&quot;
0385504209|1.0|This is a run of the mill novel mixing old fashioned Catholic bashing and New Age nonsense - it's a wonder so many readers are willing to park their brains to find \\"meaning\\" in so lightweight a book.  In 454 pages, this book has 105 \\"chapters\\" - even the author can't string enough nonsense together to write anything more than a few paragraphs at a time to make his feminist/religious points.  This \\"Code\\" is just not worth deciphering!
1587990717|5.0|This book will be very interesting for the layman. The author clearly elucidates on a number of counter intuitive topics such as statistical inference, common human biases and so on. The author also does a good job in demonstrating his varied influences and voracious reading habits to the reader. While the reader is (literally) kept hooked to the pages of the book, one is left with the feeling that the author probably had a lot more to say, but was cut off to a sub-200 page book by the publisher. The reader is also left with the feeling that a lot of arguments have been simplified in order to reach a broader audience. One often finds that chapters are too short, and that there is something left hanging, without being treated.<BR>If nothing else, read it for some perspective (especially if you trade/speculate/invest, and definitely if you have found yourself aligned to one particular school of investment thought- be it fundamental or technical).<BR>I have the author's other book on Dynamic Hedging, and it serves as a good complement to this title.
B000002UD7|5.0|This is definately the album that was a catalyst for their career.  With the popularity of their first album PLEASE, this album exceeded everyone's expectations and since then they have been known as the band that always has a hit every couple of years.  Bands come and go, some flourish for years and then eventually disappear.<br /><br />Pet Shop Boys are quoted as one of the first bands that continually keep going regardless of the era or fads that pass through.  Their music is original for any decade.  This album ACTUALLY is a perfect example of their creative intelligence and wit just beginning.<br /><br />What makes this album marked as a favorite among fans is not just that half the songs were radio hits, it's more that every song is unique and sounds completely different from the next track.  They experiment with numerous types of styles, and often go from electronic to a sudden orchestra of strings and trumpets.<br /><br />This kind of strange and sudden diversity is their trademark.  ACTUALLY is the album that states that this was just the beginning; bringing popular tunes in a more intelligent and sensual manner that goes deep into the soul, and with each new album since they continued to touch listeners through classical, electronic, rock, and even operatic pieces.<br /><br />An example is the track &quot;Hit Music&quot;--very typical 80's, fun and simple to listen to.  In their own blunt way, Pet Shop Boys will go to a slow and romantic pace of action, that lasts for only a few seconds, if not a full minute.  But always knowing to bring audiences back to the original sound, they tempt our hearts with quite beautiful, flirtatious chords that wink at you, and stop...and then begin again.  This could be why they are known for their live concerts seeming like &quot;stories performed&quot;, actors playing out roles as they sing to the side of the stage.  It's no wonder why they are asked to write hip musicals.  And why not?  It's hip music.<br /><br />Great album to start off with; and just a preview of albums to come in the 90's and into the 21st century.album to start off with; and just a preview of albums to come in the 90's and into the 21st century.
B0000CF30C|5.0|Released in 1975,&quot;Toys In The Attic&quot; perfected Aerosmith's brand of Stonesy hard rock,R&amp;B, and Led Zeppelin heaviness,thus giving the band its commercial breakthrough(it reached #11 on the Billboard album chart and sold 8 millon copies).The highlights are the super-funky &quot;Walk This Way&quot;(which was revived a decade later in a version by the rap trio Run-DMC,which featured Steven Tyler on vocals and Joe Perry on guitar),the grinding,lusty &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;,the catchy &quot;No More No More&quot;,the punkish title track,the menacing &quot;Round And Round&quot;,and the beautiful closing ballad &quot;You See Me Crying&quot;,but there's simply not a weak cut to be found here.If I could summon one word for the 5.1 SACD mix it would be AWESOME!Listening and comparing the standard 16-bit CD with the multichannel SACD is like comparing early spring and summer.The ordinary CD sounds good,but it sounds flat,compressed and muddy compared to the SACD version.The latter sounds full,punchy,clear and tough,much like music itself.You never heard &quot;Walk This Way&quot; or &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; until you heard them here!(Note:This will NOT play on your standard CD player.Sorry!)
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is absolutely amazing!  Not since buying my Norah Jones album in 2002 have I heard such musical talent, heartfelt lyrics and an ageless soul behind it all:  &quot;I don't have to be anyone other/Than the birth of two souls in one/Part of where I'm going, is knowing where I'm coming from&quot; (I Don't Want to Be).  I can identify with his words as a person in my 20's, but I think everyone can understand and connect with the themes and emotions he gets across.  He is most definitely my new obsession and I am trying to spread the word about him around my college campus as much as possible.  If you have not been excited about the recent radio play selection, his music is the answer you have been searching for in all of the immature, assembly-line pop that has been clouding the airwaves.  The best songs on the recently released album &quot;Chariot&quot; are &quot;Just Friends&quot;, a song for anyone that has ever had to watch a person they desire falling in love with someone else, and the first single &quot;Follow Through&quot; which aptly begins off with &quot;This is the start of something good/Don't you agree\\"?  I absolutely do agree and so will anyone else who listens to this album.  If you haven't noticed by now, I think I would have Gavin DeGraw's babies (and that is an invitation) haha.  Anyway, the whole point of this is to tell you to go out and get this CD right now.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004U2G1|4.0|&quot;Boston&quot;,released in 1976,became a major rock n'roll milestone,eventually selling 15 million copies,and making arena-rock a radio and concert staple in the late 1970's and early 1980's.Though despised by critics as &quot;corporate rock&quot;,the album,along with Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born To Run&quot; and Bob Seger's &quot;Night Moves&quot;,actually revived anthemic mainstream rock n' roll at a time when it nearly died out(especially with disco,punk and Kiss on the rise).Thus it captured the public's hearts and minds with uplifting hard-rockin anthems as &quot;More than A Feeling&quot;,&quot;Long Time&quot;,&quot;Peace Of Mind&quot; and every other song on this record.It still remains one of the best debut albums ever made even today.The stereo SACD mix isn't bad;in fact,it beats the standard CD by a mile,having detail and clarity(paticularly in the quieter moments)the muddier-sounding counterpart lacks,but it isn't up to the level of such SACD multichannel jewels like &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;,&quot;Tommy&quot;,&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; or &quot;The Stranger&quot;.Alas,the band didn't have much of a budget to work with at the time,so you won't find a better sounding version of the album than on this SACD.But go in with lowered expectaions,though;those looking for jaw-dropping results will be disappointed.(Note:This will NOT play on a standard CD player!)
B000002GK1|4.0|When I was 9, my family finally got with the times and got a CD player and the very first CD I got (and listened to) was Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger. I almost played this album out and to this day (9 years later) I still love it. From the dual guitars in &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; to the dreary &quot;New Damage,&quot; this was a definitive album for Soundgarden, and it was on this album that their craft of Black Sabbath-like drudgery and Led Zeppelin-influenced sophistication (with a hint of Rush-like odd time signatures). My favorites on this album were always &quot;Outshined,&quot; &quot;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers,&quot; &quot;Jesus Christ Pose,&quot; &quot;Searching w/ My Good Eye Closed,&quot; &quot;Room 1000 Years Wide,&quot; and &quot;New Damage.&quot; With Chris Cornell belting out heavy high-pitched lyrics of pure angst, with the amazing guitar solos of Kim Thayil, and the awesome rhythm section of Ben Shepard and Matt Cameron (now of Pearl Jam), Badmotorfinger is a definitive album by Soundgarden, although they would get better on their final 2 efforts.

B00011CZRE|4.0|Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a dynamic combination, one old and cynical, the other young and idealistic.

People look at me like I'm nuts, but I have never felt like this in years. I love musicals and I felt like they were really on their way out, but this makes me feel like there is hope. I can't remember they last time I cried at a movie and I loved it.

The storyline is weak, the plot thin, and if the producers had actually ever read the comic book this was based on, it might have had some promise. The only thing going for this movie is action, probably to cover the pitiful dialogue. If you are looking for a bloodbath, you found it and that's about all. The first Blade was good, Blade II is redundant.
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead just have that dark class that you can never forget and can't ignore.<BR>When I finally sat back and listened to this album I was thoroughly impressed. its old portishead mixed with some new experiments with vocal effects and sounds.  I highly recomend to and Acid Jazz, trip hop fan.  If you like this style check out artists on the Ninja Tune Label i.e. Amon Tobin, Bonobo or Blockhead..trust me you will be in heaven.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|If you bought the first set and didn't plan on getting this, reconsider. It couldn't be any better than this. There are new scenes all over the place in the Director's Editions. If only we didn't have to wait until 2010 to get a StarWars release like this, bite me George.
B00008OLYN|5.0|A true masterpiece. I am at a loss for words to describe the emotions that overcome me when I listen to this cd. Pure genius!
0790737345|3.0|It was girl's night out and I was (literally) dragged to see this movie, when it first came out!  It's not that I hate `chick flicks' (which this movie is) but I'm more of an action movie type person.  Well, `City of Angels' is one really sad chick flick and could have been more than just a sad chick flick.  I must say that the idea of this movie was promising (since this is a remake of the German film \\"Wings of Desire\\" which I have not had the privilege of viewing), but I feel looses its hidden meaning and turns into a sad clich&eacute; love story. Plus, everyone knows the shpeal, but I guess I should go into further depth with the movie. (Hey I'm not that shallow...ok maybe I am.)<br /><br />Ok, so angel dude goes down to earth to do his ritual `guide the souls' to heaven thing.  Yet, this angel dude was different from the rest of the angels because he's curious about the inner workings of humans.  He even keeps tabs on what things they like when they were alive in his handy dandy notepad (which was a part I liked). Well, he comes across chick doctor, who was working on a patient.  At that moment, she looks at him, screaming not to take the kid's life...well, he thinks she saw him.  Actually, he was in invisi-angel mode only visible to the dead and other angels.  Well, this perplexes him.  He's like, 'did she really see me??' Well, she doesn't and sadly her patient dies.  She has a hard time coping with the fact that she couldn't save him and angel dude is totally intrigued by this woman.  So he follows her and watches her interact with a world that he feels he should be apart of...(for some odd reason I hear Ariel singing \\"Part of your world\\" ...dude...have I made a correlation between `The Little Mermaid' and this movie...scary). Other angels notice his infatuation, and then warn him to stay clear from his new hobby. To no avail, he doesn't listen.  So, he meets up with her and helps her cope.  Well, they sort of take a liking to each other, although chick doctor has a hard time trusting him. Sadly, she totally freaks out when she finds out he's an angel. Boom there goes all that built up trust out the window.  Wouldn't you totally freak out if the guy your crush'n on turns out to be an angel?  He's now totally in love with this girl and she's totally freaked but oddly feels connected to him. Unfortunately, the freak out thing wins out and she can't be with him.  He's in a dilemma.  Hmm, he could become human, but how??  There's this one guy that did it, but can he do it?  Does he have enough cajones to become human for the sake of true love??  Well go watch it and find out?  (Yea, you know what happens!)<br /><br />Ok, so my portrayal is a bit off, but I think you get the gist of it.  I felt thhis movie focuses more on the romance between Seth and Maggie (wow I actually know their names) just to appease the female audiences need for romance. This could have been a great movie if they focused on his need to understand the human soul rather than do the `give up everything for the sake of love' clich&eacute;.  Another thing, I noticed with Seth is that he was in love with the idea of being in love (sort of like a Romeo complex...Oh I could go on and on interrogating the inner workings of Seth, but I'm only allocated 1000 words and I'm probably boring you right now!) and Maggie falls into play.  Her character was rather interesting (teaching Seth about humanity while he teaches her to trust in the unknown) until the ending where he acts like a complete idiot.  (This is another thing I hate about the movie.)  I guess there was a reason why the ending ended that way.  Maybe the director people wanted to get back to the main reason as to why Seth wanted to be apart of the human world in the first place.  However, storyline played more on the romance thing and lost the aspect of Seth's curiosity of humanity.<br /><br />As for the actors: Nicholas Cage did a good job as Seth (he tends to do well where his characters are rather angsty) and the same goes for Meg Ryan's portrayal of Maggie. I liked how the special effects set the mood of the story and the musical score.<br /><br />To sum it up, I would probably enjoyed the movie more if they had focused on a main theme rather than give in to the masses and create a clich&eacute; love story.<br />The movie was good until the part where he had to choose whether to stay and angel or not, the rest was a let down.  (Reason why I gave this movie three stars) Yet, I can recommend this movie to those who are into tragic love movies, but to those who hate sad endings, don't waste your time!n's portrayal of Maggie.

0385504209|5.0|This is, hands-down, the best book I have read in a long while.  I was quickly drawn in, and the ever-unfolding story held my attention wll the way through.  I was torn between not wanting to put the book down and not wanting it to end.  Contrary to another reviewer, I found the short chapters an effective means of keeping the pace of the novel brisk and exciting.  This wasn't the first time I had heard some of the theories that the book offers, but it is the first time that I have felt compelled to research them for myself.  Enjoy!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't usually listen to mainstream music. I'm more of an underground trip-hop/hip-hop junkie; nonetheless I have been exposed to this beautiful music and I absolutley love it.  <BR>I've been using amazon for three years and I have never written a review; however, I discovered the most negative and innacurate review of an album that I have ever seen on this website and feel compeled to inform you guys out there to ignore the reviews: this album blew me away. It's the perfect music for a romantic night. His voice and lyrics are so genuine and  sentimental. He's an exelent guitarist and has such sexy voice. This album has a soul.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|It's interesting that Paul McCartney waited for George Harrison to pass away before &quot;setting the record straight&quot; on the infamous &quot;Let It Be&quot; album. Of course, Ringo Starr praised Paul's efforts and called the new version &quot;bloody marvelous.&quot; However, I expected -- and deserved -- more. Where is the original, unedited &quot;Get Back&quot; album? Where is the rooftop gig? Where are the rough edges? Avoid &quot;Let It Be . . . Naked&quot; and track down the superior &quot;Get Back&quot; bootlegs that continue to flood the market. Regardless of what Paul believes, he hasn't put the &quot;Let It Be&quot; issue to rest. In fact, he has a lot to answer for -- and I'm surprised he didn't reverse the Lennon-McCartney credits like he did on &quot;Wings Over America.&quot; What a petty individual.
B000066C1N|5.0|SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON - Soundtrack is a wonderful collection of soothing music that has exquisite songs that have been breathed life into by Bryan Adams and scores that are brought to life by Hans Zimmer. As the animated figures go on a stroll on the screen the characters have been given a special aura by the background scores and the pleasing songs. <br /> Especially for those who are bored of participating in monotonous rat race of the city life, for them the album can act as balm for their bruised hearts or as a musical spa where they can relax. The sound tracks are specially designed to take one on a journey to a paradise into the world of Spirit:  Stallion Of The Cimarron; thus any day dreams of galloping like the horses can be a common phenomenon.<br />`Here I Am' has a mesmerizing effect that has been blended twice in the album. The beats in this sound track corresponds partially to the galloping of the horses in the grasslands, while base guitars brings in a vibration in the air. This song thus wakes one out of the cocoon by the words \\"it's a new world, it's anew start\\".<BR>Songs like `This Is Where I Belong' adds to the charm of a night sky while `I Will Always Return', which is also the end title has a promise stitched into it.<br />The rocky nature of `You Can't Take Me' can win the hearts of the fans, but those who tread the fast tracks of jazzy music might not enjoy the album. The sound tracks having touching words and crisp cool music are truly supposed to be a prized possession of good music seekers. Thus it is suitable for all ages and for all times.<br />`Don't Let Go' is a duet whose words have been deftly chanted by Bryan Adams and Sarah McLachlan. `Sound The Bugle' has hope and a wishes of freedom and `Fly Like An Eagle' also the main title has exotic music of independence as compared to the flight of an eagle soaring high into the sky. The album has so many dimensions of life weaved into by imagination that inspires to live free and bring all the joys of life. Not only the moods of the listeners but the weather too has been given importance as the track`Rain' confirms the same.<br />Other songs include `Get Off My Back', `Brothers Under The Sun', `Run Free', `The Long Road Back', `Nothing I've Ever Known'. This collection of fifteen tracks is a wonderful creation that should not be missed. The characteristic male voice of Bryan Adams and the magical music of Hans Zimmer create an aura around the animated creatures and nature swings to the tune of `SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON'.
055321263X|5.0|It is rare for a heroine to be ugly. One of the elements that makes \\"Jane Eyre\\" a perfect romance is that Jane is physically unattractive, just as the author Charlotte Bronte perceived herself to be. In Collins' novel also, the heroine's plainness makes her a more sympathetic character.<br /><br />Britain produced some great Victorian novelists and Collins is one of them. He is a superb stylist, making this book a pleasure to read. It does however, suffer from the 'curse of the coincidence', requiring the reader to believe that the hero just happens to be in the right place at the right time to meet the right person, not once but repeatedly. In fact the opening episode contains a coincidence so great that I almost gave up on the book there and then. Despite this clumsy plotting, the story contains much that is good, not least one of the most memorable villains in all literature. I find the hero himself rather exasperating. He hesitates and dithers, insisting always on being the perfect English gentleman while the evil foreigners run rings round him. I kept wanting to grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him.<br /><br />British novels, probably more than those of any other culture, are notable for their character portraits. \\"The Woman in White\\" is a fine example of that, as well as being wonderfully atmospheric. By common consent, this and \\"The Moonstone\\" are the author's two worthwhile works, so if you enjoy one you can go on to read the other, and be satisfied that you have 'done' Collins.
B000089RVX|5.0|This Arkansas band was listed as a Christian rock, then Goth band. They are simply a great rock/pop band. If you are lucky enough to have &quot;Origin&quot; (only 2500 pressed)--but available in Europe...&quot;Fallen&quot; is a continuation of great contemporary rock music. &quot;Fallen&quot; is really an inspiring album. &quot;Bring me to life&quot; is almost a 21st century &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Fantastic. Can't wait for their 3rd release.
B000002UAI|4.0|Here are the Beatles for the first time unplugged and somewhat folky at least halfway (on their own compositions).  The other half featuring them like their debut record (Please Please Me) performing songs they've done dozens of times live.  They finally record their first and only &quot;official&quot; Buddy Holly cover &quot;Words of Love&quot; even though he's one of their hugest influences (Crickets - Beetles).  This version sounds almost identical musically with the beat and guitars, but features far superior harmonies by John and Paul compared to Buddy's own double-tracked harmony on the original.  The recording's overall clean sound and highly reverbed vocals makes the original sound almost like a demo in comparison.  <br />&quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; sounds very schmalzy but that's how they intended it to sound.  Ringo's percussion on this record is actually quite expressive.  He seemed to know just how to fit the correct mood to the different styles of songs.  John sounds so comfortable singing &quot;Rock n Roll Music&quot; it's as if the song was written for him.  Everyone's turn at doing their covers fitted their voices perfectly, even Ringo (although George used to perform &quot;Honey Don't&quot; live as evidenced on Live at the BBC).  Paul's mini-medly &quot;Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey Hey!&quot; displays his showmanship as well as his powerful tenor.  <br />Now for the originals.  The best part of the Beatles early recordings in my opinion was the blending of John and Paul's voices.  &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;, &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;, &quot;I Don't Want to Spoil the Party&quot;, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; and &quot;No Reply&quot; feature them singing together in harmony or in unison on practically every word in the song.  Bob Dylan (and let's face it, grass) was a big influence on their songwriting around this period.  Their songs became more acoustic and folky sounding in their arrangements.  With their next couple of records (Help and Rubber Soul) their sound actually didn't change that much from this record with the exception of &quot;Ticket To Ride&quot; which has heavier guitars, but can still be classified as folk rock.  &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot; was originally written by Paul back in his old school days with a much bluesier arrangement, but he wisely reworked it and turned it into a John Denveresqe gentle ballad.  &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; has John with mouthharp secured around his neck as Dylan had demonstrated when he performed live allowing him to play his guitar and folking it up.  The lyrics are more introspective on the newer songs and actually tell a story.  &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; almost sounds out of place on this like &quot;Drive My Car&quot; sounds out of place on Rubber Soul since those songs are more of the rock n roll Beatles instead of the folky Beatles.  <br />Even though the originals on this record were few, they did introduce the world to a newer and maturing Beatles who were constantly improving as songwriters and masters of their craft.  There may not have been a true classic song on this record like their next records had like Yesterday, Help, and Ticket To Ride on Help or In My Life, Michelle, Nowhere Man, Norwegian Wood, and Girl on Rubber Soul, but this album laid down the building blocks for those future classics.  Overall, this album may sound dated with the amount of contemporary music as well as &quot;oldies&quot; packaged into it, but it's still the Beatles, and the Beatles (especially during this period in their careers) could do no wrong.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Yes, yes it does. I'm just throwing my coin of best movie ever into the best movie ever pot. How did this movie not win some kind of award. Anyway, theatrical brilliance.
B000000OA6|5.0|All you have to do is look at the album cover to see Queen was back at producing fine works of art.  Like the Beatles of the mid 60s (with their experimental and sophisticated music) everyone was wondering where Queen could have gone if they had stayed the course of their 70s sound with a more mature and updated approach (not to say some of their 80s experiments were bad nor were the Beatles back to basic records after Magical Mystery Tour).  <br />Queen shyed away from progressive rock in the 80s with occasional hard rock songs from time to time such as &quot;Hammer To Fall&quot;, &quot;Tear it Up&quot;, &quot;One Vision&quot; and mixing in some new wave &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, &quot;I Want To Break Free&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; along with funk/disco &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, &quot;Body Language&quot;, and back to roots rock n roll &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Man on the Prowl&quot; all to great effect, but I think we all wanted something more &quot;QUEEN&quot;.  <br />&quot;Innuendo&quot; is Queen finally realizing their potential at creating stylish masterworks that only they can offer.  The title track is an epic song with different sections including an operatic section.  The Spanish guitar part is something very unique and Queen make it appear as if it's naturally supposed to be a part of the song, not just a cheap gimmic.  &quot;I'm Going Slightly Mad&quot; has a great atmosphere to it's sound with the sampled voices synth effect.  Out of any Queen song they ever did with a synth, this is clearly their best use of one.  The lyrics are clever and is pure Freddie.  <br />&quot;Headlong&quot; and &quot;I Can't Live With You&quot; were amazingly written at the same time by Brian after he had locked himself in the studio and feature some of the best guitarwork and vocal harmonies in any Queen song and believe it or not, there's no synths in either song.  My favorite part of &quot;Don't Try So Hard&quot; is the middle eight part (&quot;Oh What a beautiful world...&quot;).  There are such deep and powerful vocals in that song from a man who would be dead just a few months later.  <br />&quot;Ride the Wild Wind&quot; definately sounds like Roger's writing and believe it or not has Freddie doing his best baritone (other than his Barcelona album).  &quot;All Gods People&quot; has &quot;incredible&quot; harmonies in it (maybe the best since &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;).  Great piano playing by Mike Moran is also featured on that track.  &quot;These are The Days of our Lives&quot; is Queen doing an Adult Contemporary anthem if there ever was such a thing.  &quot;Delilah&quot; always brings a smile to my face when I hear it.  It's so full of love, joy and humor.  <br />The &quot;Hitman&quot; sounds like it belongs as a theme song to some TV series about a hitman.  &quot;Bijou&quot; is the prettiest song Queen ever recorded with flawless vocals and Brian's best guitar tapping.  Where do you ever hear a song with guitar tapping like that that isn't a fast heavy song but instead it's a soft ballad?  &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; couldn't have been a more fitting ending to such an inspiring album.  Unfortunately, the show didn't go on for Freddie.  The remaining members of Queen would go on to release a solid album of his final recordings, but since Freddie wasn't there to oversee this and make his own final decisions on those tracks, this is truely their last album together.  <br />God Save the Queen!
0694003611|5.0|I received this book as a gift well before my first child was born. Of course, I had heard of it, but after reading through it a few times, I became enthralled by the book's magical and hypnotic rythms. The spare choice of words, the repitition, the soothing rhymes and the mysterious house, illuminated in the darkness, reveal something different in every reading. You can read it to your baby to get her ready for sleep, to your one-year old for the sound of the words, to your 2 year old for the rhymes--one of the books that you will put in your treasure box and save forever.

B0000AR8NK|3.0|While this certainly isn't Bowie's strongest effort, it is certainly commendable for an artist who has been around for so long to still put out music of this quality. I tend to agree with other reviewers that this CD functions as almost an extension of Heathen (although as a whole I like Heathen a lot more). <br />It is a good mix of songs, from upbeat rockers (New Killer Star, Reality and Never Get Old--the latter being one of my favorite Bowie songs I have heard in a long time), dark and haunting (Loneliest Guy, Bring Me The Disco King), and some subtler songs that tend to sound better after repeated listens (Fall Dog Bombs The Moon, Days). Of course, there are a few that still don't do anything fore me, including She'll Drive The Big Car, Looking For Water, and the George Harrison cover, Try Some Buy Some.<br />For fans of Bowie, this definitely belongs in your collection as the good songs are strong enough to justify purchasing the CD. To newcomers, this is probably not the CD that is going to make you a fan, and you should definitely look into his early years then work your way up.
B00005JKC3|5.0|entertainment value. I believe you may need to be a fan of the character the Hulk, comic books, and Ang Lee to enjoy this movie to the fullest. I loved it. The camera angles in comic book panels were fantastic! Eric Bana does nice, repressed work. Nick Nolte is unfortunately over the top. Jennifer Connelly does A Beautiful Reprise to her role with Russell Crowe. <BR>As an action flick, this movie is slow to start. You want to see the green baddie sooner.<BR>As a serious movie delving into surpressed feelings and bad parenting, this gets the job done. The problem is that the storytelling stagnates a bit as the entire first half of the movie is devoted to showing us how bad Banner is off. <BR>The CGI is slick and polished. <BR>The thing is, it is not as entertaining as it should have been. It is a little too serious and there is not enough protagonist action for us to really find some fun. That's really it. There isn't enough fun. Banner could maybe start to appreciate the good stuff he can do as the Hulk, instead it's all very serious and afflicted. In any case, I loved it on most levels, but it is not the entertaining movie that Spiderman is.
0060012331|2.0|I'm a diehard Pratchett fan, and so when I bought this book after reading all the novels (up to The Last Hero), I felt distinctly let down. This wasn't a bad book in any way except comparing it to Terry's earlier works of two decades of witty retorts and spliced fables. This book has the same sort of premise, but has a distinct 'lite' feel about it, presumably for the younger audience he seems to be aiming for. The sad truth is this is not a kid's story, and the stripped-down vocabulary does not do justice to Terry's writing skills. All in all, this is, I say again, not a children's book and will not pass muster for the teenagers and the adults: It winds up in a no-man's land in the middle.
0783222955|5.0|Midway through this outstanding movie, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in an Alabama town during the Depression. As the tensions of the trial reach fever pitch, Atticus is summoned home to protect his family from a rabid dog. The mad dog, an obvious symbol of the madness of prejudice (and the only symbolism in the movie) is killed by just one shot from Finch. This is one of the simple themes of the movie: all you have to do is confront and face bigotry, in order to eliminate it. <br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is undoubtedly one of the most important and most engaging movies of post-WWII America, and a cinematic emblem for the civil rights movement of that era. From the incredible opening credits, complete with Elmer Bernstein's heartbreakingly beautiful score, you know you're in for a great movie. Seen through the eyes of Atticus' tomboy daughter, Scout, the film runs the familiar gamut of a child's world: the scary neighbor; the new kid in town; the first day of school; and the need to be close to a parent. But the aptly named Scout also sees something that most other children do not: the dark world of grown-ups' hate. <br />But Scout is not just an observer; she's a fighter who's not afraid to duke it out with the boys in her school. In this way, she is a sort of foil for her father whose fighting spirit is internal, calm, but just as effective. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is full of outstanding performances. Gregory Peck is appropriately understated, although passionate when the moment calls for it. A very young Robert Duvall, in the bit but pivotal role of Boo Radley, conveys the pathos of a manchild locked away from the rest of the world. I defy anyone to watch Brock Peters as the wrongly accused Tom Robinson and not be moved. However, the movie is carried by the amazing and convincing performances of the child actors, Mary Badham as Scout and Philip Alford as her brother Jem. They are so genuine, so not like child &quot;stars&quot; (because they weren't), that, at times, you forget you are watching little actors.<br />This is a film to be watched on several levels but none more important than its stirring interpretation of childhood rapidly coming to terms with the adult world around them. It sounds trite and banal, but Horton Foote's screeplay, Robert Mulligan's textured direction, and the performances, sidestep any temptation to take the easy path of cliche. This is a demanding movie that requires a lot from us as film watchers and as human beings.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|&quot;Oh this is the start of something good.&quot;  Very fitting first words on an album that is at the very least, something good.  Gavin DeGraw's Chariot is easily one of the most unabashedly honest and timeless albums ever released.  His straightforward lyrics and wonderfully soulful voice sound like those of a seasoned veteran, not a 26-year-old's debut release.<br />Gavin DeGraw's lyrics gracefully walk the fine line between easily-accessible, cliché pop lyrics and completely personal introspection.  He eloquently writes about personal experiences in a way that makes it easy for listeners to relate.  The range of music on the album - from the soft sounds of \\"More Than Anyone\\" to the dirty guitar riff of \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" - is part of what makes it a timeless album.  I've been listening to this album since August 2003 and I don't think I'll ever have to retire it from my heavy rotation.<br />Today's music market is flooded with mindless pop, but artists like Gavin DeGraw keep my faith in new music alive.  He is one of the few artists today that breaks down genre barriers and sings from the heart.  A good all-around album, Chariot, is one of the few CDs I own that I can put in the CD player and never have to hit the skip button.  Every song is worth hearing - no filler songs here.<br />Comparing him to singer-songwriters such as Billy Joel, Ben Folds, and Stevie Wonder doesn't do Gavin justice because his voice and style are entirely unique.  The only comparison that I can venture to make is that Gavin DeGraw sounds like home.  Listening to him is like coming back home from a long trip, walking into your house and taking a deep breath and thinking, \\"Oh, yeah.  That's what my house smells like.\\"  Gavin's album, Chariot, is the comfy, old faded corduroys of my CD collection.<br />As wonderful as this album is, the music doesn't truly come alive until you see Gavin in concert.  He's an enchanting and charismatic performer who owns the audience from his first step on stage to the very last note.<br />Buy this CD now.  Get in and hang on for the ride.  I have a feeling this boy's going to be making exceptional music for quite some time.
B000056VJ7|5.0|WOW! What an album. Bat out of hell soars above every other album and laughs at them in their faces, simply because it has the right to do so. This is a fantastic album which made Meatloaf a legend and created some of the most memorable and recognised songs ever. It was Bat out of hell, You took the words right out of my mouth, Paradise by the dasboard light and Two out of three ain't bad which made an unlikely superstar out of Meatloaf.<br />This album blew me away when I first heard it and altough a few of the songs may now sound a little dated, the magic from the first time I heard it is still there. Not one song on this album is a dissapointment which is why the album has lasted for over 27 years. it's the third best selling album ever and has stayed it the UK charts for over 472 weeks (That's almost 9 years!). Bat out of hell was #36 in the US music charts in 1990 thirteen years after its release and has sold over 35 million copies worldwide and continues to sell over 200,000 copies a year, today. I don't think it will be long before this album outsells every other. <br />Meatloaf is known as the Pavarotti of rock and this album really shows off his operactic, bombastic, over the top and theratrical style of music. This album is vital to anyones music collection and if you haven't got a copy yet, it is well worth getting. I'm a huge Meatloaf fan but I do not lie when I come to reviewing his music. Personnally I think this album is an absolute masterpiece of contempory rock and is the proof that Meatloaf is still, larger than life... and always will be.
0380789035|5.0|I have only read American Gods and Neverwhere.  I will start by saying that Gaiman goes much deeper into American Gods with describing characters and settings.  I was captivated by both and I agree that there were more comical parts in Neverwhere.  However, Neverwhere is not in the same leauge with American Gods.  This book is for much more mature audiences and some may not be able to handle that.  It is a much harder read, but that does not mean it is not as good as Gaiman's other works.  Its genius can be compared to Pynchon's &quot;V&quot;.  Honestley, after reading some of Stardust and all of Neverwhere I have come to a conclusion: it would not be a stretch to say that Gaiman's only great work is American Gods.

Another example of this formula can be found in another slightly better film, &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, which is on a 'space-ship' rather than a regular one.<br />An ocean-liner disappears many years ago, only to be discovered again inhabited by ghostly beings. There are some parts better than others, with some good old/new fashion jumps. That's what really counts nowaday's, I suppose. But, there were many times when I was left scratching my head, &quot;Where's Gabriel Byrne?&quot; The old &quot;Forget about the character's until the plot (did I just use the 'p' word as a descriptive?) needs them to turn up.&quot; On the other hand, there are quite a few surprises as far as the &quot;why's and where's&quot;, but once you know this would you want to watch it again? Describing the acting as GOOD, would be devulged as the same GOOD as Samuel L. Jackson, Dustin Hoffman, and Sharon Stone in (the letdown in my life-creation of my favorite book) Sphere. If you Loved Ghost Ship, I can understand why.<br />But for me: A good one to watch once. Rent her. Fin'
B00011V8CW|4.0|Finally, BTWN is available again. It is missing one thing though. Where is the &quot;alternate mix&quot; of &quot;Jump They Say&quot; that was on the original version? At first I was hoping that the &quot;rock mix&quot; was just a renamed alternate mix, but it is not. As a completist, I guess that I'll just have to hang on to my original copy.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Centered around the town's and cities where I have spent my entire life, Big Fish has cast its spell upon me; weaving through my imagination.<br />It tells the story of a young man trying to find out whom his father really is. He has speant his entire life hearing stories of illustrious fables surrounding his dad's life, but when a heart attack brings them both to their knees, his son wants to know the truth. What follows is a journey which lover's of great stories must take. There are witches, haunted houses and trail's with living trees, giants, too-perfect towns in the center of a dismal swamp's with so much more to discover. There is love which literally stops time and commitments that are forever sealed. This is all just a taste of what you will experience. It is a wonderful story, that will survive through history as a classic, mark my words.<br />This is a sure-fire film drizzled with magic and tales that aren't so short. It will remain as one of my favorites - there is no doubt. ~s.a.o.s.~

0380002930|5.0|I read Watership Down the first time within about 6 months of its release over (sigh) a quarter of a century ago.  I re-read it for the several dozenth-time over the Christmas holidays just because I hadn't read it cover to cover for several years.<BR>Watership Down is a spectacular story of heroism and fear, of an overwhelming need to find a home, of glory and battle and of just plain old bunnies.  In the end it doesn't matter which level of the book you read - whether deep in the layers of metaphors or shallow in sheer fun of being a rabbit sprinting in the morning dew - Watership Down works.  We're all a little bit of Hazel-rah's intellect, and a little bit of Bigwig's courage and a little bit of Fiver's insight and a little bit of everyone who's ever set out on our own to find a new home.<BR>Read it, enjoy it, love it, remember it, use it.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|listening to this soundtrack was like reliving the Triology all over again. I've cried in many of the sadder pieces, as i thought about that characters of the parts of the film it was describing. <br />It is absolutely amazing! Howard Shore's musical score is so emotional and beautiful. From the yarn at the \\"Prancing Pony\\" and the heartache from \\"The Gray Havens\\" this soundtrack will have you simply captivated with awe.
B00000JR29|5.0|A while back I picked up &quot;20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection&quot; release issued by Universal Records in 2000.  According to the liner notes, the songs have been remastered.  I never really thought they sounded that great for remastering.  I bought the remastered and reissued &quot;Songs From The Big Chair&quot; (which was actually issued in 1999) album a few weeks back and was blown away by the difference in sound quality.  I really don't think the &quot;20th Century Masters&quot; collection was really remastered.  Some tracks are quite dull.  I've compared &quot;Everybody Wants To Rule The World&quot; and &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; on both discs and the versions on &quot;Songs From The Big Chair&quot; are much more crisp and clear.  I have gained a whole new appreciation for these songs, among the many others featured on this disc.  So thumbs up to Universal for at least offering this better, remastered version.  For those who say this reissue isn't worth it, take a listen to the difference in sound quality.  Then again, if sound quality isn't that important to you, then stick with your original copy.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is my favorite of the Yes DVDs I own (also having Keys to Ascension and House of Yes).  The sound quality is phenomenal.  The audience is respectful but enthusiastic.  I think reviewers here have said plenty.<br />I just want to comment then on the orchestra.  I did see this concert live in Philadelphia at an outdoor show, with good seats.  I really had a hard time hearing the orchestral parts and found that it didn't really enhance their sound at all.  Listening to this concert on this DVD, I hear the contribution that the orchestra truly made.<br />My favorite parts include, for one, the end of the &quot;I Get Up, I Get Down&quot; section of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;.  The orchestra just soars with Brislin's organ and Anderson's ethereal vocals, and it gives me chills to hear it.  Anytime I listen to the original now, I hear that orchestral part.  Another great moment occurs in &quot;Ritual&quot;.  The middle percussive section is breathtaking with not only four of the band members belting out percussives but the orchestra with the staccato strings.<br />Finally, &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; just becomes all out WAR in the middle as the band and the orchestra battle out a section that can easily become a muddled mess, but turns into a complex and glorious war.<br />If you do not own another Yes DVD, get this one.

B000001FE0|5.0|This is still the lushest of all the Bee Gees' albums, unless you count the late, great CUCUMBER CASTLE.  That alone makes it worth hearing a few hundred times but my, oh my- -those songs.  I don't know what the rift was over the band's direction that temporarily broke them up (a family affair, you see), but whatever it was the Brothers rose above the occasion and created one of the finest records of the glorious, inglorious Sixties.  It was their last of that decade, and everything they'd done previous to it, great as it may have been, was merely prelude.  In England ODESSA was released as a red-velvet two-LP box set; in the States as a red-velvet double LP with a remarkably green disaster-at-sea insert.  You could put the thing on your coffee table (or floor, or kitchen counter) and let it speak for itself, or you could lie back and immerse yourself in its velvety sonic ocean.  Or both, with or without headphones.  Okay, that may be overstating it, but ODESSA contains some of the Brothers' finest compositions, ranging from the story-telling prog-rock of the title track (the cello solo is an ingenious touch) to the lighter-than-air, lovely 'Melody Fair' to the oboe-chugged, acoustic 'Suddenly' (Maurice was always the underappreciated contributor) to the desperately haunted 'Sound Of Love'.  Heck, they even included an international anthem that actually sounds like one, the prescient globalists!!  And two other orchestral instrumentals to boot!  And- -'Lamplight'!! You want goofy instead?  Okay, 'Give Your Best', and 'Never Say Never Again'! There! These guys are awesome!  Now, stop me before I start raving about how incredible CUCUMBER CASTLE is!!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Musicians have to overcome difficult tasks in order to maintain a pop career.  Alicia Key's task is a huge one.  Her debut album was such a hit with both fans and critics that her sophomore album has to meet unprecedented standards in order to keep everyone satisfied and maintain her reign in the soul genre.<br />Born Alicia Augello-Cook in New York City and later moving to and growing up in Hell's Kitchen, this soulstress shocked the world with her hits \\"Fallin'\\" and \\"Girlfriend,\\" and delivered a great rendition of the Prince tune \\"How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore?\\"<br />Songs In A Minor won Keys a couple of prestigious accolades, including a Grammy.  With its beautiful blend of jazz and contemporary R&B, the album soared to the top of everyone's charts.  It seemed like a case of beginner's luck.<br />However, after a two-year absence, Keys returns with The Diary Of Alicia Keys, which indicates the artist's strong presence and resilient talent.  Although the album does not include a blockbuster ballad like \\"Fallin,'\\" and isn't as hit-packed as its predecessor, fans could not have asked for a better evolution, considering the sophomoric-slump stress that Alicia must've gone through.<br />The first single, \\"You Don't Know My Name,\\" sounds like a run-on chorus with Boyz II Men-esque romantic dialogue amidst its Motown air.  An awkward arrangement for a released song, yet it is somewhat satisfactory.<br />Keys revisits old school soul, which is the basic template of her music, with \\"If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By.\\"<br />Keys opens with a piano interlude on \\"Harlem's Nocturne,\\" at talent she mastered when she was seven and is clearly showcased in \\"Diary\\" and \\"When You Really Love Someone.\\"<br />Keys also does not leave the street beats that she is known for.  Keys earns street-cred with \\"Karma\\" and embodies neo-soul on \\"Feeling You, Feeling Me,\\" an interlude that beautifies the flow of songs on the release.<br />The singer visits her true roots when she delves into Aretha Franklin territory with \\"Wake Up,\\" and experiments with a bigger band on the enticing \\"Heartburn.\\"<br />The Diary Of Alicia Keys does not fall victim to the sophomoric slump that is so evident in the pop world.  While it is a recognizable record with a superior ring to it, it does not come near Songs In A Minor.  That is in no belittling of Key's talent or ability.  It is merely a subtler, less grabby record with the same delicious components that you have to look for in order to appreciate, unlike the face value of the debut.<br />It seems like Keys did the right thing by dropping Columbia University for soul stardom.n territory with \\"Wake Up,\\" and experiments with a bigger band on the enticing \\"Heartburn.\\"<BR>The Diary Of Alicia Keys does not fall victim to the sophomoric slump that is so evident in the pop world.

B000005JA8|5.0|It's all here.  Son House, Howling Wolf, Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Dadaist poetry and that other worldly eight and one half octave voice.  Trout Mask Replica is one of the great recordings of modern music.  Over the years, it has influenced many other artists inclduing Pere Ubu, John Lydon, Devo, the Fall, the Styrenes, the Electric Eels, the various no wave bands and even the Clash.  Beefheart was a true original, a genius.  A note to Billy Altman:  The Mascara Snake was not the drummer.  He was just the good Captain, Don van Vliet's cousin who did some bass clarient blowing and a little vocals.  The drummer of course was John French, alias Drumbo, an incredibly skilled musician who was able to translate Beefheart's avant garde ideas into the most challenging and exciting percussion work you will ever hear.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|\\"Trouble\\" is the lead single from this raunchy release and that is just what Pink is set to make in the music world. With every release, the once-R&amp;B singer delves into harsher melodies and grittier concepts. This led to a punk direction that would make Alanis Morrisette look soft. No longer does she need to impress anyone with snappy one-liners like in her debut single \\"There You Go\\", or bore us with radio-friendly dance tracks such as \\"Get The Party Started.\\" Try This is a proclamation of complete creative independence and an assertion that Pink is not here to satisfy, but here to astound.<br />If you ever doubted that attitude can be served on audio then Try This is your proof. The second track is ready to be videoed and served up as a single, and \\"Last To Know\\" is a an angst-ridden statement with direct lyrics.<br />Pink does not have time to be Missundaztood, like her last release; this time she simply doesn't care. Her album is packed with rock producers and her tracks meander from Aerosmith-tints to a Pink Floyd sounding \\"Humble Neighborhoods,\\" which is a highlight on this release, with its uncompromising rigor and riot outlook.<br />This time around the pop is put on a back-burner while the Philly queen churns up her armchair psychiatric sessions into fury sessions on the mouthwatering hidden track and odes to the aching heart on \\"Catch Me While I Am Sleeping.\\"<br />This effort does not lack low-tempo numbers, however. Pink visits striking simplicity on \\"Love Song\\" and unabashed sensuality on \\"Oh My God.\\"<br />This is an exciting time for pop music as everyone is straying away from the basic templates and experimenting with new things. Pop is no longer a boxed-in genre; it is a combination of all categories packaged in a more appetizing manner.<br />This is demonstrated on many tracks on this release from the Janis Joplin tinted \\"Unwind\\" and the classic rock of \\"Waiting For Love.\\"<br />The album does misstep, however, on the previously-released \\"Feel Good Time,\\" a song taken from the Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle soundtrack. Even with the finesse of William Orbit, who is responsible for Madonna's Ray Of Light, it falls flat as a lackluster attempt at a hit.<br />Pink embodies the persona of the struggling artist; even though she is a multi-million dollar success, she continues to struggle in order to create a record unlike any other.

0393317552|4.0|This has to be the book that brought into play, for me, a series of startling theories on the human condition.  It is awesome as a starting point for gaining informaation on the world of genetics, evolution and the Human condition.  It can be quite detailed but the writing style tends to be accessible, allowing for the book to draw you in.  This also makes the the use of data and terminology far more digestable.  As a critique of human history, it informs and analyses very effectively.  It proves a most interesting read as you begion to discover the events that shaped and effected the course of human evolution and ultimately your oown existence.  Mind Blowing!  I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE AS IT WILL DFINITELY AFFECT THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN WORLD AND BEING!

This is a summer record made for the autumn.
B00005N5S5|5.0|In one of the greatest sci-fi action movies of all time, this amazing film was a breakthrough in cinematic history. Brilliant small-time director James Cameron became a hot property with his highly original screenplay and masterful directing in \\"The Terminator.\\" It also brought a somewhat known, former bodybuilder champion Arnold Schwarzenegger into the ultimate action hero and brought him A-list status. This film is pure genius!<br />In the year 2029, the world is rural wasteland. The machines, ruled by super-computer Skynet, has taken over. The human resistance, led by the brave John Connor, rallies the rest of civilization to go up against the machines. They win after a hard fought war. To change the past, Skynet sends an \\"indestructible\\" cyborg, the Terminator(Schwarzenegger) back through time to Los Angeles 1984 to assassinate Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton), John's mother, to prevent her unborn son from saving mankind. The resistance intercepts by sending one of their own, soldier Kyle Reese, back through time to protect Sarah from the unstoppable Terminator, who feels no pity, remorse, or fear. <br />I love Arnold. His \\"I'll be back\\" line is the greatest, or one of, movie line in history. His best role ever doesn't have that many lines, but his demeanor, fiercing look and powerful screen presence makes him the perfect choice for the Terminator. Michael Biehn(Kyle) and Hamilton also give great performances whose characters onscreen can't help but love each other and fear the cybernatic organism after them. Director Cameron, who would go on on to make \\"Titanic\\" and \\"T2\\", balances great innovative special effects(a bit primitive nowadays) and fine action sequences. <br />The DVD ain't too shabby either. It has a good picture and new digital sound transfer, documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers and storyboards!
B00005A1PR|5.0|The music industry, as always, is the obedient trend follower.

When Britney made it - Christina, Jessica and Mandy \\"sings-from-the-side-of-her-mouth\\" Moore arrived shortly thereafter.<br />With Erykah's success, we find Jill Scott surfacing and, now, India.Arie bursting into the biz scene.<br />India.Arie is the newest addition to the neosoul phenomenon. She is signed under Motown record's rooster and was a Lilith chick. Her debut \\"Acoustic Soul\\" is a collection of soul ballads and bluesy folk hymns.<br />India.Arie's name is, as you might've realized, a bit different. The dot between her first and last name looks peculiar. One can't help but wonder if she is trying to be unique or if her father is a Web site. But, regardless of her name, compared to what is on radio nowadays, her music sticks out like Cher's old nose.<br />As an introduction to India.Arie, her record company released a music video titled \\"Video.\\" The song was a marvelous rant on the objectification of women in the media. It serves as an insightful statement when sandwiched between \\"The Thong Song\\"2 and Britney sexually molesting a chair.<br />The rest of the album follows the debut single in a mellower tone. \\"Promises\\" brings the atmosphere of a dim bar, while \\"Brown Skin\\" is a ballad to shag by. The promising debut does not plummet from there. The album evolves into a mature anthology of songs for life.<br />\\"Strength, Courage & Wisdom\\" develops into a sing-along after a couple of listens - habit that you will form after you play this album.<br />There is nothing better than a low-key tune with hard bass beats, which this album offers in \\"Nature.\\" India.Arie is experimental with her music, but doesn't stray out of the soul category. \\"Back To The Middle\\" is reminiscent of a young Tracy Chapman.<br />\\"Ready For Love\\" and \\"Always In My Head\\" are connected by a slow interlude, which some people underestimate the power of. In this case, the interlude blends the sonic themes of both songs.<br />Interludes are used to create a certain atmosphere by interconnecting songs - it works magic for some artists.<br />The album moves on to more street-wise beats. \\"I See God In You\\" makes a pleasurable lullaby, but \\"Simple\\" outranks the tracks with its subtle melodic approach.<br />India.Arie is very similar to other neosoul artists. She has the earthiness of Erykah Badu and the smooth edge of which D'Angelo is a master of. However, she has the moodiness of Des'ree and the meloncholy voice that will remind you of a slow Billie Holiday.<br />\\"Part Of My Life\\" sounds like a slow-mo Motownphilly tune, while \\"Beautiful\\" is a mellow ballad.<br />The moody album ends with a skillfully crafted tribute to her role model Stevie Wonder. With this bonus track, \\"Acoustic Soul\\" is concluded with an uplifting air.<br />Her new video might help as a sneak peek of the album, but there is no assurance that this soultress will float through the media's short-lasting attention to talented newcomers who can bust a tune without having synthesizers plugged in everywhere - a brave thing to do.<br />There are few albums that take you up and then down and still leave you satisfied.

0316666343|3.0|Amazon won't let me give this 3 1/2 stars, which is what I believe it deserves, but since the disappointments came at the end of the story, I'm rounding down to 3.  Ms. Sebold has written 80% of a great novel.  She lost her way in the ending chapters, however.  I can't elaborate much without spoiling things, but suffice it to say that when deus ex machina takes place just in time for the sex scene I rolled my eyes in disgust. Maybe I'm missing the big picture, but when you spend 300+ pages making me sympathize with the protagonist's inability to touch the world she's left against her will, a world she can only observe in sad rememberance, only to craft a contrived return-to-earth-for-that-roll-in-the-hay-with-that-guy-she-had-the-hots-for, I lost all suspense of disbelief.  It seemed to me the novel's power came largely from Susie's removal from Earth and her inability to interact with the world she was dragged away from while she watched her family cope with her absence.  Allowing her to return, in a scene that would make a B-movie sci-fi movie director blush, to complete her ascent to the plane of Womanhood, was too much for me to take.  I closed the book convinced that it was really Susie's sister Lindsey who was the real protagonist here.  This is a really the story of a surviving sister's ascent to closure and adulthood in the face of her sister's murder than what I think the author had in mind.
B00009W0U4|4.0|In Irreversible, the director Gaspar No&eacute; is pushing the audience into a dark sphere where the audience is exposed to some truly brutal violence as if No&eacute; wants to educate the ignorant minds of the masses.  Thus, No&eacute; is creating a very offensive experience as the story is told in reverse where the audience already knows of the coming events as the story unfolds.  The story itself will not be revealed here, however, the violence is extremely grotesque and might cause distress and disgust among the audience members.  However, behind the nastiness there is something to be pondered that might leave the audience with an echo ringing &quot;You cannot escape your actions.&quot;  The cinematography is cleverly tied together with each frame, and it leaves the audience with a disturbing and distressing cinematic experience that might affect their sleeping patterns.
B00003CXCD|5.0|No point in getting defensive about someone else's opinion, but Robert Horton (Amazon.com essential video) is considerably off the mark with his assessment of the casting of Gregory Peck.  Gregory Peck's stiffness as an actor was always part of the package -- can't change it, or the whole persona falls apart.  He's perfect as a foreign news bureau reporter, with a self-consciousness that fits the character to a &quot;T&quot;.  Mr. Horton suggests Cary Grant, who would have been 'way too slick and charming.  As for William Wyler's direction, it's a perfect pairing with Peck's performance.  Though Wyler was never afraid of a jump-cut, and the staging and continuity are a little ragged, we have to remember that this thing WAS filmed on location in post-war Italy, so it wouldn't have been the most trouble-free shoot.  The actor who plays the hairdresser who snips the princess's hair early in the picture is a gem.  As to Audrey Hepburn, this was the first time she rolled out that performance that she would essentially repeat again and again for the rest of her career.  It was a limited bag of tricks, but each gesture, each look, each line delivered with that accent, was miraculous.  Do I adore Audrey Hepburn?  Yes I do.

There's no other way to put it.<br />I was raised by a mother who sings jazz. I was taught that at the heart of music is the emotion it conveys.

I'm running out to get this as soon as I get paid friday.<br />Excellent music knows no bounds.

There's so many influences all over this, from the Rolling Stones, to Elton John, to Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and the list goes on. The album opens with the first single &quot;New York, New York&quot;, which is an excellent place to start the album from. &quot;Answering Bell&quot; was also a single from the album. The ballads are really nice, such as &quot;La Cienga Just Smiled&quot;, &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot;, &quot;When The Stars Go Blue&quot;, etc. The album closes on a high note with &quot;Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd&quot;. There's some weaker tracks (like &quot;Enemy Fire&quot;) but also some of his best like &quot;Nobody Girl&quot; and &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot;. Another great album from this prolific artist.

6305313687|5.0|The first few minutes of AHX are intended to horrify and shock you, to show the callousness of people who hate other people simply because of racial or ethnic stereotypes that have been blindly forced upon them.  Edward Norton really shows off his acting chops as he transforms from a bigoted, murderous neo-Nazi to a gentle, rehabilitated older brother trying to prevent his impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following in his misguided footsteps.<br />The film is both uplifting and tragic, as well as brutally realistic.  Without spoiling the ending for anyone who has not seen the film, Norton's pain and guilt will linger with you long after the credits roll.   Yet from all the tragedy of the hate and violence that consume the characters in this film comes a ray of hope--with the guidance of Dr. Bob Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) Norton's character, and ultimately Furlong's character, both have small victories in overcoming the cycle of hate.  The ending of the film reminds us, however, that we still have a long way to go in race relations in America.<br />Beverly D'Angelo, Elliot Gould, Stacey Keach, and Fairuz Balk also play convincing supporting roles in this powerful drama that is well worth watching.  Although it is certainly not intended for young children with its violence and graphic rape, AHX is one of those films that should be mandatory for older teens (17-18), especially those who might be pre-disposed to hate a certain religious or ethinic group due to their environment.  As another reviewer aptly stated: \\"hate is learned and can be unlearned.\\"  The un-learning of hate is precisely what this film is all about.
B000001FS3|5.0|You've heard songs from the album on the radio. The others are great, too.
B00000K19E|5.0|What more can be said about this groundbreaking film?  It absolutely redefined the entire action genre, and did so with unrivaled flair and panache.  The film does for Generation Y what the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; did for the younger half of GenX.   <br />Not only are the film's special effects groundbreaking and visually stunning, but the action is superb as well.  From dazzling mid-air martial arts to bullet dodging to the shoot-em-up &quot;lobby&quot; scene, it is little wonder that this was the first DVD in my collection.  My only regret is that I never experienced this film in a theater--I saw it for the first time on fullscreen VHS, which simply does not do it justice.  <br />The movie succeeds on all levels, but perhaps the thing that most clearly indicates the greatness of this movie is that I never tire of watching it again.  The special features on bullet time and the commentary tracks are insightful and interesting, making Matrix a must-have for any DVD collection.
6304458223|4.0|The story of &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is fairly predictable, in that we know full well that young Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is going to persuade her father, Thomas (Jeff Daniels), to come up with a way of teaching a flock of adopted goslings how to fly and get them to a winter refuge in North Carolina.  But predictability is not always a deterrent to a film being enjoyable or even inspirational, and you have to pity someone who cannot enjoy watching a bunch of baby geese running after Anna Paquin, convinced that she is there mother and therefore responsible for imprinting on them what they need to learn to survive.  Besides, for what is ostensibly a children's film this one opens with a rather shocking scene, where we see a fatal car accident during the open credits while listening to a gentle melody.  If there is anything that indicates this is more than your usual predictable children's film, this would be it.<br />If there is a flaw in &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; it is that the relationship between daughter and father takes a back seat to the story of the geese, so that the pathos that exists there is almost lost in the flapping of wings (but there is a nice moment and a good line when the father tells his daughter why he know what she can do it).  They two have been estranged by distance (he returned to Canada while his wife and daughter lived in New Zealand), and living together is not improving things.  He is an eccentric artist and inventor who cannot figure out how to connect with a living human being until the geese that come between them bring them together.<br />Fortunately, dad is spared the role of being the villain, because there are land developers at both ends of the flight and a wild life officer who knows what the rulebook says about domesticated geese.  But those are just minor hurdles to the idea of flying 600-miles in four days in an ultra-light plane for Amy to lead her geese to their promised (wet) land.  Yes, the idea that the clock is ticking and that bulldozers are ready to roll in North Carolina is all a bit much, but then there are moments, like when the ultra-lights and geese fly through the skyscrapers of Baltimore than just about take your breath away.<br />I was not aware until after I watched the film that director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel had previously collaborated on &quot;The Black Stallion,&quot; but that certainly makes sense because both films are perfectly willing to let pictures exist without dialogue.  The other commonality is that &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is another film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kiddies.and that bulldozers are ready to roll in North Carolina is all a bit much, but then there are moments, like when the ultra-lights and geese fly through the skyscrapers of Baltimore than just about take your breath away.<br />I was not aware until after I watched the film that director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel had previously collaborated on &quot;The Black Stallion,&quot; but that certainly makes sense because both films are perfectly willing to let pictures exist without dialogue.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a great cd. She really shows that she knows how to write a song. There are great dance songs and 2 great ballads. I believe that her song 'Everytime' is the answer to Justin Timberlakes 'Never Again' <BR>Best Songs:<BR>Me Against The Music<BR>Boom Boom<BR>Showdown<BR>Breathe On Me <BR>Early Mornin'<BR>Toxic  ( Great Video,good effects )<BR>Outrageous<BR>Touch Of My Hand  ( Fave Song should be a single )<BR>Shadow<BR>Brave New Girl<BR>Everytime<br />I cannot stand 'The Hook Up' it is the most gayest stupidest song she ever has sung. Ok thats my review!
068484267X|5.0|I am a teen, and when It come to reading I want to run and hide. My English teacher wanted us to do a book report. I looked for days,for just the right book,Then I saw it. The cover caught my attention, It looked so good, that I had to give it a try. From then on I couldn't put it down, I thought my childhood was rough. I love how Frank has both sad and humorous.You will cry and laugh out loud. I recommended it to all my friends and they are telling theres. I can't wait to read Tis. 5 stars, I love it!!!
B0000UHFC6|5.0|Howard Shore is a genius! This soundtrack is amazing! [one note about the DVD included with the limited edition- the bonus DVD is okay, but the 'supertrailer' is edited very poorly]
B00004RF8J|5.0|Oh wow!!!  I love this movie and just had to get it.  The songs are great and so are the actors.  I recommend this movie to everyone.  It is a classic.
B00005UOXN|3.0|This 1987 collection of club remixes extends some of Idol's hits to dancefloor length and brings the rhythms to the fore. The eight minutes+ White Wedding works especially well as this version loses none of its ominous, brooding quality while the remixed rhythms certainly turn it into a club stomper. The Uptown Mix of Dancing With Myself also works well as a dance track and I like this lively up-tempo version of Mony Mony (the old Tommy James/Shondells hit) with its hypnotic circular rhythmic patterns.<br />To Be A Lover is one of my favorite Idol songs but it is rather short in the original version and in this dance mix the patterns become a bit repetitive at times. Hot In The City and Flash For Fantasy are all right, but I would have preferred remixes of some other hits like Sweet Sixteen, Eyes Without A Face or Don't Need A Gun instead. This album is great for retro parties and still gets the feet moving when played at clubs, but might not appeal to all of Idol's rock/pop audience. I think it is a successful dance adaptation of his style and would have given it 5 stars if the aforementioned omissions had been included.
B00009ATKS|5.0|I don't know if I would call this rock, but I would call it rock before I would call it anything else. This is only of three CD's which I have bought straight from the factory which I can put on and just start listening from the beggining and not touch it till it's done. It is, in other words, perfect. I can't say I'm familiar with their work, and it was only by serendipity that I came across this in the first place. But I have listened to the audio clips and I think they are good reflexions of the music on the CD. If you like the clips, I can only suggest that pick up this amazing CD right away. For a suggestion, Track 6 is my favourite of those available, track 8 is also splendid, but unfortunately not available.<br />The music is progressive which I am opposed to a priori. But the mix of instruments and the lack of vocals make this CD a great success.
B0000W3YIS|4.0|In the Zone is much different than her other cd's. The album has a great beat, most of the songs make you wanna get up and dance. The best song on the album is Toxic. The only problem is when she tries to sing the song everytime you can hear her lack of vocal talent. she needs to stay with her more whispery voice that sounds good. If you are looking for a album with great vocals then this isnt for you. Buy christina aguilera-stripped cd. Other than that i recomamend buying In the Zone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Let's just make this short and simple. The lyrics are superior. Some songs really hit home with me and have made me cry b/c i cant relate to xtina, i go to one of the most strict private schools in the us and im not your private school type. im a step under the girls from 'thirteen'. i love every song and xtinas voice is amazing. when i feel really depressed instead of purging or screaming i listen to a song and it givbes me hope., its so very amazing. please buy, you wont regret it~~~
0385512104|5.0|I think the 6 hours of CD listening is the best way to absorb the book since you can slowly get the deatils of what the autistic protaganist is thinking.<br />By the way, one reviewer notes that the author is wrong about the math puzzle mentioned. The reviewer has also been fooled, along with some mathematicians. I didnt understand it the first time either, but the solution in the book (as Marylin Savant writes) is correct.
B00000JGOH|5.0|there are only a few words that can describe this movie's greatness. all i can say is you have to see it to belive it.
B000000P17|3.0|Many people bash this album based on GNR's breakaway hit, Appetite for Destruction. However, one cannot compare the power of 6 singles on a 12 song album.<br />Look at the Use Your Illusion albums and this brings about a change in GNR's side. After making a foray into bloated ballads and over-engineered hard rock, GNR shifted back to loud, pissed off post-teen junkie angst.<br />&quot;Down on the Farm&quot; is a great anti-detox tune, &quot;Human Being&quot; expresses a downtrodden's strike back at the people hurting him, &quot;Ain't It Fun&quot; is an excellent anti-heroin tune, &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; and &quot;Attitude&quot; were well placed together as strong rock, and &quot;I Don't Care About You&quot; into the hidden &quot;Look at Your Game, Girl&quot; were strong finishers.<br />As with any GNR album, this does have its poor tracks. AFD had &quot;Think About You&quot; and &quot;Anything Goes,&quot; Lies had &quot;Nice Boys,&quot; &lt;i&gt;UYI&lt;/i&gt; had quite a few songs that should have been rejected.<br />TSI has &quot;Since I Don't Have You,&quot; &quot;New Rose,&quot; and the Duff McKagen track &quot;You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory.&quot; They just did not have the spunk of all the remaining tracks.<br />Overall I liked this album, but the weak tracks made it a much less enjoyable experience than it could be.
B00013F35I|5.0|Watch Bruce and the E-Street Band having fun on stage, and if You dont find yourself singing and dancing with them - THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great set that is selling great, five stars from all reviewers, need I say more? Best entertainment you can get for 35 bucks around. Great writing, great acting and character development, great special effects, gripping stories, etcs. Best Sci-Fi show ever.<br />Just a thought off to the side. The networks are really going to the crappers, I find myself watching nothing except HBO shows now a'days. The success of this disk set is an indication that DVD sales could actually be a good forum for Joss and Company to distribute future episodes of Firefly. I for one would be willing to pay a few extra bucks for DVDs and cancel my Cable subscriptions. Who needs reality TV, shopping channels and sit-coms. I would much rather buy or rent shows like Sex and the City, Buffy, Angel, and of course Firefly. I think there is still money to be made there.<br />p.s. There is rumor of a Firefly movie! Please let it be true.
630575067X|2.0|Ive waited 20+ years for this piece of crap?<BR>Theres just way too many flaws here. Lucas's directing skills is one of them.<br />When i first saw this movie i felt a shiver and goosebumps all over my body. The title started scrolling and you started to read the story ............ The NEW star wars story and thats about the height of it all. 2 hours later i wanted 2 hours of my life back.<br />I gave this movie 2 stars for a couple reasons.<BR>1. its a star wars movie (had it not been it would have gotten 1)<BR>2. I cant go into the negitives.<br />What went wrong you ask? Well heres a small list of pros and cons.......<br />Pros: <br />-Its a star wars movie.<BR>-Good politics<BR>-great visuals<br />Cons:<BR>-This is a Star Wars movie? Wake me up im having a nightmare.<br />-Terrable dialog. I mean seriously, its about equivillent to that of a ninja turtles or pokemon episode. George also did a wonderful job of using the words &quot;bantha fodder&quot; about 10 times.<br />-Bad actors. Very few of the actors actually sounded convincing.<br />-Horrific character interaction. I never got the sence that others mattered to one another. Unlike the first trilogy which managed to do that perfectly.<br />-Jar Jar. I love childrens characters and movies, From the lion king to ice age. And i can understand what lucas wanted to do with jar jar, the problem is he went completely off the deep end in creating this character. I guess he wanted to make the most annoying, wacky, ignorant character he possably could and in the process alienated anyone over 12.<br />-An overall lack of attention to what really mattered. I think lucas was so involved with what he &quot;could&quot; do with the visual effects he never asked himself what he should use it for. Insted he decided to use effects in the movie to cover up all the errors he made, and theres alot.<br />-Lucas should have written all three scripts togeather.<BR>If he would have done this, he would have realized that the first episodes time should not have been spent on pod racing and medaclorians. This has basicly screwed the rest of the series.<br />Well im not going to go on with the cons, i think you get my drift.<br />I will save you some time though and do an episode 2 review really quick.<br />Pros:<BR>Read above<BR>Cons: <BR>Read above<BR>+<BR>-Terrable love story. I'm a man, thus enclined to dislike love stories, however i can tolerate them to a point as long as they are good. This was not. It seemed like he wanted to take an episode of a day time soap and throw it in. That didnt work.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Seeing as I have been a big fan of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" since childhood I was delighted when I read that a musical was being made about what happened \\"before Dorothy dropped into\\" the land of Oz.  At the time I found this out the show was still in pre-Broadway tryouts in San Francisco and there was no CD yet but I found out there was a book.  I promptly read Gregory Maguire's fascinating novel and liked it very much.  However, \\"Wicked the musical\\" is not the novel, though I think it still gracefully captures all the important themes from the book.  I don't know why there are some people who are irritated by that fact when Gregory Maguire himself is pleased with the musical.  <br />I purchased the CD the day it came out.  I don't usually do that without hearing at least one thing from it but seeing as I knew I loved the story and have been a big fan of Stephen Schwartz for many years I figured that I probably wouldn't be disappointed.  I was right, the cd was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.  And like many others I was irritated that there was no plot summary in it, though having read the book I could deduce from the songs themselves what was going on.  I then saw \\"Wicked\\" on Broadway the first weekend in January and it was one of the absolute best broadway musicals I have ever seen (and trust me I have seen quite a few) I recommend it highly, I plan on going again.  Once you see it you will understand why there are no liner notes in the cd.<br />Back to the CD, the music is absolutely fantastic, there is something for everyone.  I have had the cd for over a month and it has yet to leave my CD player, everytime I listen to it I have a new favorite song.  As so many have said \\"Defying Gravity\\" is by far the best number...it's just the kind of song that gives you goosebumps because it has a greater message than just furthering the plot.  Kristin Chenoweth is absolutely hysterical she nails the part of Glinda, not to mention that her voice just soars in this role.  However, the realsensation in \\"Wicked\\" is Idina Menzel as Elphaba, The Wicked Witch of the West. Her voice is profoundly amazing...and if you think she sounds fabulous on the CD you should hear her live, that is especially the case with \\"No Good Deed\\".  The harmonies are also amazing in this score, from the chorus right up to the two leads. <br />In short \\"Wicked\\" is a triumph and I can't wait for Tony time.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Edward Norton's movie is always worth watching.I love his wonderful performances but I wonder why he always portrays a bad guy,like Aaron Stampler/Roy in Primal Fear,Worm in Rouders,Jack Teller in The Score,and this time,Steve.   Anyway,as I said,Ed's movie is worth watching.The Italian Job isn't an exception.
0805062971|5.0|Hey chuck, wanna fight.<br />i think you have to get past seeing the characters of brad pitt and edward norton, and even helena carter to be able to read this book with a clear conscious.  however, if you should happen to read it, and see the movie, then well thats cool too.<br />its a good read.  pretty quick, pretty painless.  other than learning the facts about my contributing to the corporate cop out in america.  <br />yeah im part of the rat race as well narrator, but come on, lets face facts, it beats the alternative. or does it?<br />the narrator, call him jack for now, is quite a fellow with quite an interesting mind.  perhaps so interesting that he could be a schizo.  other great littel tidbits about this book is the wealth of knowledge one gains in corporate espionage.  darn you chuck, you have turned my one man city campaign of destruction terror and mayhem, and made it into a commercial success.<br />hisss at you chuck.<br />but buy it, read it, love it, become a member of the legion, but please keep on reading.  thats the great thing about chucks books, it made me read, it made me think, and it made me continue that groove well past his library, and into the libraries of so many others who can contribute to your life in so many ways.<br />happy hunting
079073253X|5.0|This is one of the most moving stories I've ever seen.It's not just a movie for entertaiment.It's much more meaningful than those Hollywood's big-budget blockbusters like &quot;Matrix&quot; or something else.I watched it for 3 times on the first day I bought the DVD(sadly there're no extras).I was totally moved by it.There're several scenes making me cry and 3 of them are the saddest:Shakes tells the terrible sufferings at Father Bobby's home;Michael meets Carol at the subway;the four and Carol gets together in the end.The music is also a big success and heartbreaking.I love the four kids,and the four grown-ups too.Yeah,they are the &quot;Four Gladiators&quot; as Michael says.After having watched the movie for several times,I still keep thinking about it,and I'll think about it for a long time.I'll never forget it..        In a word,this is a great and must-seen movie for everyone that has a real mind.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I first learned about the volatility of New York and its infamous draft day riots while watching Ken Burns' Civil War miniseries years ago.  This movie zooms in on that volatile climate in New York City and its epicenter in an immigrant community called the &quot;Five Corners&quot;.  Gangs controlled the streets.  Political offices were bought and sold by the gangs.  The fire departments were controlled by the gangs, and fire fighters would often end up in fights at a fire--with the winning fire company looting the burning building!<br />A young boy, Amsterdam (DiCaprio), witnesses his father's death at the hands of Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis).  He returns to the five corners as an adult with the intention of avenging his father's death.  He joins Bill's gang and becomes Bill's right-hand man.  But in the process, he is so influenced by Bill that he almost loses his desire for revenge.  But Amsterdam is ratted out and beaten senseless by Bill.  The movie culminates in the street fight between Bill and Amsterdam and their gangs in the midst of the NYC draft day riots during the Civil War.<br />PROS<br />* Day-Lewis is just a tremendous actor.  He is so believable as Bill the Butcher that I completely forgot he was acting<br />* Visually stunning; great set pieces; great crowd scenes; great juxtaposition of the haves and have-nots of NYC in the 1860s<br />* This basically happened.  I enjoy historical fiction and biography.<br />CONS<br />* Some of the musical selections, particularly the rap number during the first gang fight were terribly out of place<br />* DiCaprio is a little miscast as Amsterdam.  It's hard to believe him as a tough-guy pugilist.  His performance seems a bit flat, and in the end, I didn't care if he killed Bill or not.<br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Well worth seeing.  For those of us who appreciate Scorcese and historical fiction, we will see it several times.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great series: smart, funny writing, good characters and acting.<BR><BR>No complaints whatsoever on the series itself or the quality of the contents of the DVD.<BR><BR>My only complaint has to do with a couple of things that it would have been nice to have as bonus features on the DVD. For example, at the beginning of \\"The Train Job\\" episode as originally aired (and it was the first episode Fox showed), there was a spoken introduction from Book (Ron Glass) that pretty well summarized the back story for the series (\\"After the Earth was used up, we found a new solar system and hundreds of new Earths were terra-formed and colonized. The central planets formed the Alliance and decided all the planets had to join under their rule. There was some disagreement on that point. After the war...\\"). I understand there was a similar introduction spoken by Mal (Nathan Fillion) before at least one later episode. I understand (and support) leaving these off the actual episodes, since they were there presumably to resupply some of the continuity and context Fox's bizarre schedule decisions had taken away. It still would have been nice to have these brief segments available as bonus features, though.<BR><BR>Also, I think Morena Baccarin is perfect as Inara, but would have been curious to see some of the scenes with Rebecca Gayheart (which I gather from the commentary on \\"Serenity\\" were actually shot, as she was replaced after production was already under way).<BR><BR>Finally, I loved Alan Tudyk's audition, and wish we'd gotten to see the same for some of the other actors.<BR><BR>Again, though, I love the series and the DVD, so I really shouldn't be complaining (too much!) about these relatively minor unfulfilled wishes.
0385504209|5.0|Wow!  I am so turned on to the interesting factoids about Leonardo Da Vinci, Religion, Paganism, the Roman Catholic Church and more!  I couldn't put this book down.  It was a fabulous read, educational and full of suspense.  I admit, it reads as if intended for a movie (wouldn't be a bit surprised!),but it's so damn good anyway.  It truly charged me with interest in the topics mentioned above, I'm thirsty for more and researching!  Take a chance, it's so worth it!
B000002GQH|5.0|Looking back, and listening to many great albums over the past 35 years or so, there are certain ones that never get old, never get dull, or become dated. Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti comes to mind. Floyd's Wish You Were Here, Simon &  Garfunkel's Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, & Thyme, Rush's Permanent Waves, The Doors' debut...among others. I hesitate to use the word 'masterpiece' because it is so overused (and mostly associated with garbage), but these are true masterpieces in music, both for the awesome song writing, original melodies, as well as the AHEAD OF IT'S TIME PRODUCTION! The Moody Blues' On the Threshold of a Dream is right up there with all of them. All 5 members contribute to its content, with Tony Clarke at the helm. It is an experience to listen to this album. If you have never heard it, prepare yourself, because someday in the future, you will remember where you were when you first heard what is possibly the greatest musical work ever made (and I don't say that about just anything....this album is wonderful). Folks...this thing was released 35 years ago! And to think these 5 men were 20 something year old kids at the time. Totally unbelievable. And how sad it is to know that there are  millions of young people worldwide who have never, and probably will never, experience this true ...forgive me...masterpiece!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I am sickened by the negative reviews for this CD that some users have posted.  People who feel that this band is not for real had better have a reality check.  Granted, if they didn't like the first Strokes CD, god knows why they'd want to buy the new one- it is a very similar CD, except with a faster, more catch pace.  And that is a beautiful thing.  The infectious lyrics and guitar lines are incredible throughout the CD, and Songs like &quot;The end has no End&quot; and the first four tracks of the CD in sucsession should help to quell anyone's doubts.  These guys are the real thing.  If you liked &quot;Is this is&quot;, you'll love &quot;Room on Fire&quot;.  Enjoy
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Movie was definitely not what it was built up to be.  I thought is was a decent movie worth watching, but there was not near enough action scenes.  I think there are like 3 through the whole movie and only 1 of them is of any length.  The action scenes and the special effects were good when they actual happened but the movie left alot to be desired.  The ending leaves the story ready for a sequel, lets just hope if it is made they action put some action scenes in.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I have never seen as outstanding a concert as this.  I watched it for the first time last night, and would have to say this is one of the best gifts I've ever received.  Even my children, ages 10 and 13, were entranced.  They finally understand why I've always said The Beatles were the greatest of all time.<br />From beginning to end, this concert represents the humility and talent of George Harrison.  At no time does it become bogged down in sappiness.  Even the surprise addition of a mega-celebrity to the Monty Python skit is so toned down it would be easy to miss.<br />The star of this show is soley George Harrison's music.<br />Two things I must mention:  Firstly, the presence of George's lookalike son adds a most surreal feel.  At times, Dhani even adopts the movements of his father, and you would swear a teenage George has morphed from the Ed Sullivan Show directly to this concert.  And secondly, as others have noted, Eric Clapton's rendition of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" should go down in music and concert history.  I've never heard anything like it in my lifetime, and I'm old enough to remember seeing The Fab Four's first performance on Ed Sullivan.  It is moving as hell, and more brilliant than anything I've ever heard in rock & roll.<br />This is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who ever cared for The Beatles or rock and roll in general. There is not a single song or performance you will want to zip past.  Every single moment is breathtaking.<br />Just buy it and hear for yourself.
B00008LDPU|4.0|Ok right now: Do you want the red pill or The Blue pill?<BR>These words(While paraphrased...) hooked me into one of the best science fiction sagas of all times. While the first had mystery, the second relied on action, the third...still trying to figure that one out. That's where the Animatrix and the Enter the Matrix video game come in. While many reviewers have already said what I am going to say, here goes...This gives you a deeper understanding of what the matrix actually is. My favorites are as follows:<BR>1. Final Flight of the Osiris is by far the best one on the disc. <BR>2.The Second renissance (If I spelled it wrong, my aplogies) parts one and two are wholly depressing but tell you about the machines rise to power. <BR>3. A detective story tells a fun version of everyone that we want to be.<BR>4. Kids story explains the theory of self-sustination outside of the matrix<BR>5.World record also tells how one person can become aware of the matrix and the world around them<BR>The others are not that integral to the overall storyline for Reloaded or Revolutions, but are entertaining nonetheless...<BR>So now the question arises:<br />Does the Matrix Have you...?

0679720200|5.0|.<BR>In the story of the Stranger, one finds the lead character, Meursault lacking creativity and of passions within oneself, of the depth of conflict that burns in one's center that moves with chaos and value-positing; none of this can be found in Meursault. He is matter of fact in everything. True, his acceptance and passionless being allows him to under go his ordeal in subdued emotion and unenthusiastic plight, yet this groundlessness and existential being does not excite in living, but simply goes along in existing. <BR> <BR>Even in Meursault's act of killing, there lacks any real passionate fervor. His pulling of the trigger was just that; an easy act of the finger and no real understanding, that is, no depth in comprehension of the act itself, but merely a nonchalant action that seems to have been the best alternative of action at the time of occurrence. And yet, the lack of alternative actions is the problem. <BR> <BR>In each and every situation in Meursault's life, from the death of his mother to his sexual relationship to his befriending his neighbors, all is performed as a cog in a machine. As each piano key is hit, only to be in succession of what is already programmed on the sheet roll of music. The \\"last man\\" mentality of the Lockean view of self-preservation dominates Meursault's life as the bourgeois in existential nothingness and mediocre existence. <BR> <BR>Should Meursault suffer as he did for his actions? Were they really so evil? Were his actions simply the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or in this case, befriending the wrong person who caused these thugs to appear for Meursault to confront? If life can be reduced to existence over conflict then certainly Meursault could be pardoned.  But the one must ask if Meursault's action, the act of murder, not of self defense, can ever be excused, simply for the fact that the man who committed such did so from a lack of inner conflict and passion, from an act that simply called to be for the moment it presided in.<BR> <BR>The answer to Camus' Meursault comes from our view of subjectivity or objectivity. The Stranger places us in the former as we are personally involved as we read the story from the inside view and thus we side with Meursault. Yet when we are able to detach ourselves and look objectively, we gain a higher perspective and thus a different viewpoint.<BR> <BR>Robert Shattuck, from his book Forbidden Knowledge, remarks on The Stranger with the following point, that knowledge can be double bound; subjective or objective;:<BR> <BR>\\"The closer one approaches to an event or to a person, the less securely one seems to know it. The trees obscure the forest. The more one knows, the less one knows. Perception itself requires a certain distance. Empathy hides more than it reveals.\\" p. 162 <BR> <BR>Our closeness brings empathy, which distorts our power of observation and obscures the facts. That appears to be the case in Camus' The Stranger.
B00006690F|4.0|This album has it all...the regular Eminem ...talkin disses, Eminem singin, Dr Dre, D-12 and great lyrics. Ever since I have had this CD, it hasn't stoped playing.

Below is my track rating (1-5):<BR>Curtains Up (Skit): 1 (very short intro)<BR>White America: 5 (expresses Eminem's surprise because of how people feel the same as he does)<BR>Business: 5 (Great song)<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet: 4<BR>Square Dance: 4.5<BR>The Kiss (Skit): 2<BR>Soldier: 5<BR>Say Goodbye To Hollywood: 4.5<BR>Drips: 3<BR>Without Me: 5 (the single, great, like his others)<BR>Paul Rosenberg (Skit): 1<BR>Sing For The Moment: 5<BR>Superman: 5<BR>Hailie's Song: 5++ (EMINEM SINGS!)<BR>Steve Berman (Skit): 1<BR>When The Music Stops: 5<BR>Say What You Say: 5<BR>Till I Collapse: 5<BR>My Dad's Gone Crazy: 5++ (features Hailie)<BR>Curtains Close (Skit): 1<br />*Limited Edition DVD contains a music video, Eminem's movie trailer, and concert excerpts.*
B00006BTCA|1.0|Take away the pleasantly dissonant guitar work and you've got Brian Ferry singing &quot;My Sharona.&quot; Punk (post, pre, or whatever) is (by definition) irreverent. This music is as calculating as anything by Brittany or Justin, except that the lyrics are hoarier.
0062502182|1.0|This is an infantile book that seems to be written at a fourth grade level.  There's nothing profound or deep about the book, in fact I found it so boring that I struggled to finish it despite the fact that it's really short.  Doctor Seuss has better, more thought provoking material.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Wesley Snipes returns in this really gross and really exciting sequel to the original hit. <br />Blade (Wesley Snipes) is still out killing vampires, this time armed with better special effects. He is tracking down his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson, the most grizzled man on the planet), who was taken by the vampires and held hostage. In the meantime, Blade has picked up a new weapons master, Scud (Norman Reedus, who looks a lot like Henry Thomas). Whistler is rescued, and he and Scud immediately do not get along. <br />The vampires Blade is always trying to kill want a truce. It seems there is a new race of vampires, called Reapers, led by the very ugly Nomak (Luke Goss). The Reapers are killing ordinary vampires, and once that supply is gone, they will turn to humanity for their prey. Blade is saddled with a group of mercenaries called the Blood Pact, who were originally trained to kill him. It features angry Reinhardt (the always excellent Ron Perlman) and the sexy Nyssa (Leonor Varela), daughter of the vampire leader Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). <br />The plot really becomes secondary as Blade and the group infiltrate an underground hangout for vampires, and do bloody battle with the Reapers. This leads to a very long battle in the sewers where the Reapers congregate, and finally to the vampire headquarters, where double crosses and switched allegiances are ultimately uncovered. <br />This sequel can be described in one word: gross. I have not seen this much bodily fluid on display since my lactose intolerant toddler feasted on an ice cream cone. I am not talking a lot of fake blood, I am talking a lot of fake everything shown in graphic detail. The film is wall to wall violent, an almost two hour action sequence broken up into three or four main components. <br />Do you know what? The whole thing works. The special effects are strong, save for a couple of obvious computer animated fight sequences. The gore is excellent, from the Reapers' frightening mouths to the gallons of gore to the grossest autopsy of the last ten years. The film makers wisely just do not remake the first film, they expand on it. All the actors are good, making an impression despite the plethora of eye candy going on around them. Even the actors who are completely unrecognizable under the makeup (Goss, Kretschmann) still score some good scenes. <br />Del Toro is the perfect director for the sequel, he shoots it like he has been practicing for this for years. The film certainly never bores, moving faster than anything George Lucas has been able to come up with since \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" <br />The couple of weak computer effects hurt. So does yet another villain who confesses everything before being killed in a very creative way. I won't give away any of the double crosses, but you do see them coming from a mile away. <br />All in all, \\"Blade II\\" is really neat. The action is nonstop, a forced romance is merely hinted at, and Snipes can kick bootay with the best of them. If a third movie is in the making, I'm ready. This is the film that give sequels a good name.
1869504917|5.0|Having just returned from NZ on a self-guided Lord of the Rings tour using this book as our map, we found it very good in providing details of what was filmed where and whether it was feasible to get there without a helicopter tour or how much driving would be involved on gravel roads etc.  Some directions were a little difficult to discern on the ground (not having access to a GPS)but we eventually found our way to all of the sites we wanted to get to (we visited about 20 locations mentioned in the book)- you will usually find some other fanatic wandering around in the remote location carrying this same guidebook.  If you are planning a trip to NZ and want to see some LOTR sites, get this book.  It also provides information on other interesting things to do in these film locations.
B000063JDE|5.0|I hated it.  I really did.  I was deeply offended by this film when I first saw it.  It disturbed the hell out of me, in all the wrong ways.<br />Then I saw Lost Highway - a film that, it seems, everyone hated BUT me.  I thought it was a masterpiece of psychological horror; a real mind-bender with an extroardinary interior perspective on homicidal madness.<br />So I got to thinking: maybe I should give Blue Velvet another shot. Maybe I just wasn't ready for it 17 years ago.  This time I would be prepared for Dennis Hopper's demented Frank Booth.  I would be ready for the ear in the field. I would be ready for the unbelievably creepy and kinky scenes in Dorothy's apartment.<br />What I saw was a different film - not because the film had changed, but because I had changed.  A lot can happen in 17 years.  A guy can grow up.  A guy can sense for himself the underbelly of perversion beneath the white-picket facade of middle America.  A guy can come to appreciate a wickedly funny and disturbing film about the hypocrisy of genteel exteriors.  A film like Blue Velvet, in other words.<br />David Lynch's great skill as a director is his ability to aim right for the hind-brain - the unreasoning, alligator brain where the primal self lives.  His work tends to hit there first, and then ricochet to the reasoning self.  That's why his work is so evocative.  Critics and audiences alike struggled to &quot;explain&quot; Mulholland Drive, and while a sensible explanation for it is possible, it sort of misses the point.  These films are waking dreams - or nightmares - that, like paintings or pieces of music, try to touch something deeper than the intellect.  You can't read  a Beethoven symphony like a novel, you can't play Edvard Munch's &quot;The Scream&quot; on a musical instrument, and you can't understand Blue Velvet in terms of ordinary realism.  To do so is to run screaming from it in terror or disgust, as I initially did.<br />But taken for what it is - a kind meditation on the darkness inside - you start to see the outragousness of this film in a different light.  You start to see that the characters are not so much two-dimensional freaks as they are embodiments of primal forces we all have inside of us. In Frued's moth-eaten old psychoanylitic terms (really a poor way of approximating, but it's the best I can do), Frank Booth is the hedonistic Id.  Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) is the pure and virtuous Superego, and Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle McLaughlin) is the ego - the waking part of us torn between the two.<br />Of course, this is a Reductionist view, and it really does disservice to the artistic acheivement of Blue Velvet.  To really appreciate it, one needs to set aside preconceptions and let the experience of it percolate through that gray matter.<br />The DVD itself is well produced, with some nice extras (rare on Lynch DVDs), and a beautiful film transfer that really showcases Frederick Elmes' cinematography.<br />If you're a David Lynch fan, you don't need convincing.  If you're where I was 17 years ago, give it another shot.  You might just like it. A lot.darkness inside - you start to see the outragousness of this film in a different light.

B000099T2L|3.0|Not a bad album.  I agree with other comments that she did too many ballads and should have put in at least 3 more upbeat songs.  She has excellent vocal talent and whether she goes solo and stays with Destiny's Child, she will always do well.
B000000Y2R|5.0|This cd is an amazing document. If this was the only surviving artifact of the 20th century, of human civilization tout cour, then future races and alien species will undoubtedly be in agreement (however naively) that we were giants, that we, as a people, humans, earthlings, had emotional depth, a refined aesthetic sense, humour, intellectual refinement, and anything else you would want and hope for in sentient beings. The music here is perfect, sublime, peerless in its execution, epic in its scope, minute and detailed like the most finely wrought baroque trifle. Everything that it is to live and die in this world finds expression and reflection here. Unbelievable. Unforgettable. Unsurpassed. (100stars!!!!!!!!!)<br />I don't know where I find some of the words contained here, anyway ...
B000002BMV|5.0|Even though I'm only a casual fan of Journey but this is a classic album, this was one of the best selling album's of the early 1980's, I'm going to rate this track by track.<br />Don't Stop Believin': A mid paced pop tune that is laid back and catchy, at first I thought that this song was called Strangers in the Night, this song was a Top 10 hit in the fall of 1981. 5/5<br />Stone In Love: This song is kind of resciment of the Evolution/Departure era but it's a great song, great guitar solo at the end of the song. 5/5<br />Who's Crying Now: This song believe it or not was actually Journey's first Top 10 hit and I thought that their earlier songs would be Top 10 hits but boy, was I wrong or what? This song kind of reminds me of listening to the Marty Balin era of Jefferson Starship. 4/5<br />Keep on Running: This is a great song and one of the heaviest songs on this album, this is one of Journey's most underrated songs of all time, Neil Schon is one of rock's most underrated guitar players in history. 5/5<br />Still They Ride: I never really cared much for this song although it was a Top 20 hit, it's a bit too boring for me. 3/5<br />Escape: This is another Journey standout, good vocals by Steve Perry and great guitar playing by Neil Schon. 5/5<br />Lay it Down: This is another great song by Journey and I'm surprised that this song wasn't a hit, which goes to show you how good Journey is. 5/5<br />Dead or Alive: I would consider this to be the weakest song off of this album, although it's far from bad, it pales in comparision to the other songs. 3/5<br />Mother Father: This is an emotional song with orchestras in the background, this song was actually co-written by Neil Schon's father and this song is about a troubled family, this is a beautiful song that brings tears in your eyes. 5/5<br />Open Arms: We return to the ballad format with Journey's biggest hit single reaching #2 on the Billboard charts in early 1982, another interesting fact is this song was on a movie called Heavy Metal, this song still gets timeless airplay to this day and believe it or not, when I first heard of this song, I didn't know that it was Journey that sang this song. 5/5<br />If you're a casual fan of pop music or classic rock, then your collection wouldn't be complete without this album, another album that I would recommend is Foreigner's '4' or REO Speedwagon's Hi Infidelity.
6303073107|5.0|Rashomon is a fabulous film.  When a nobleman is murdered and his wife raped while travelling through a wooded area, a bandit, played by Toshiro Mifune is accused of the crimes and an inquest is held.  The witnesses--including the spirit of the murdered noblemen--each recount conflicting and contradictory accounts of what actually happened.  To what extent it is the result of simple faulty memory or the product of willful deciet is for the viewer to decide, thus making for a very thought-provoking movie.
0156027321|5.0|This has got to be one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.  So much symbolism and metaphors, I felt like I was back in grammar school! I couldn't wait to tell everyone what each animal symbolized, I thought that I might have a test after reading it.  A great union of two different worlds that one would never think of.  Who would of thought that you can combine zoology and theology in one book and at the same time not confuse the heck out of the reader.  I highly recommend this book, probably one of the best books I have ever read.
B00005QXDD|3.0|This effort is kind of like Kielbasa sausage.  Given the correct cooking measures, it still isn't a great meal.  Great production (most of the disc is mixed and engineered by the brilliant KEN ANDREWS), and some great song structure can't elevate TENACIOUS D to the status of serious musicians.  The themes and lyrics of the songs are amusing the first couple of listenings, but after that they get old.  JACK BLACK is simply too obnoxious.  If he could save the schtick for films and T.V., and focus his decent singing abilities and write smart lyrics, TENACIOUS D would be a hard rocking force to be reconned with.  Instead cool songs are marred by a kind of arrogant, jokey style usually reserved for comedy albums.  The other half of D, KYLE GASS, shows some true string craftsmanship, and should console MR. BLACK in getting musically serious.  Not a bad disc to have in one's collection, but I find myself never having played my copy 3 weeks after purchasing it.  Alas, my smirks had turned to grimmaces.  TENACIOUS D is good, but could be so much better.
B000063K2W|5.0|This is a movie about the lives of a group of New York socialites who's loves revolve around gossip, fashion and the art of being just a woman. Very entertaining, funny and it's so amazing that gossip was entertaining then as it is today in the age of cell phones, internet and tv, we still seek that most entertaining of all guilty pleasures !
0156027321|5.0|What a fantastic read.  For those who gave negative review, I am astonished at your lack of taste.  This book is wonderful in every aspect.  The style of writing.  The images it produces.  The tale it tells.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all.  Thanks to the author...a truly masterful storyteller.
0743455967|5.0|I was completely blown away by this book. It is different from any book on writing I have read. I enjoyed the excerpts from King's life. What an inspiring tale of a writer making it - and an example of hard work and tenacity paying off.<br />King's advice on writing is basic and to the point. He doesn't give a magic formula but realistic suggestions and personal experience.<br />I recommend this book for any writer and even non-writers who want to know more about the real life of writing.
B0000640VN|1.0|Here is typical Hollywood drivel. A slightly new twist on a cliched plot, with so little fresh flavor to it. Meg Ryan looks like she was very bored making this movie, and plays a pale version of her usual, competent if not brilliant romantic heroine role. Her hair looks like it was cut with a hacksaw and she is getting too old for the emaciated waif look altogether. The only reason I sat through the whole thing was that I had bronchitis and had not much energy to do anything else.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I avoided this movie like the plague for years- saw it on Tv the other night- and am completely obcessed with it!  I have the video to Come What may on my work computer- and listen to it endlessly.  Who knew that Nicole and Ewan could sing?!
B00005V9IK|2.0|What do Will smith,jeff goldblum,judd hersh and bill pullman all have in common?Absolutely nothing,so why are they all cast in this movie together,who knows?Sure it has some spectacular special effects moments,but that doesnt save this dryed out plot and a cast who has seemed to be picked out of no where.All fine actor's in there own way,but this is just downright goofy at times.Also there is no reason what so ever that Randy Quaid should even be in this movie,sure he's funny but is that what the movie is really about,umm no.If you want real sci-fi go for alien's,even the comical moments in it are all better than the serious parts in this movie.
B0000009NG|4.0|If you're a fan of heavy duty rock guitar, then look no further than Mick Ronson's crunchy guitar on this album. The guitar is mixed loud and upfront. The songs often start and stall, but for me the slow parts just provide anticipation for Ronson's raging guitar to reappear. This album is often criticized for having a non-stellar performance by Bowie, but I think that it's fine. It's sort of like a medieval version of  A Clockwork Orange. The album just doesn't have the poppy, catchy sound that so many Bowie fans are attracted to. A must for all rock guitar players. Suliman Lindh turned me on to this disc back at the Madrassha, and Osama and I spun it relentlessly when we were hunkered down in Tora Bora during the bombing campaign. Check out the soaring guitar at the end of  &quot;All The Madmen.&quot;
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Absolutely the worse album Britney has made.  Keep this up and she's old news before her 23rd birthday.  Since when is moaning, groaning and giggling considered music?  Very BAD decision to hitch up to middle-aged Madonna too.  Britney should spend less time partying and more time trying to develop a VOICE.  It doesn't exist on this cd.
B00009V7T2|1.0|how cute, a little crap emo band broke up and some of the members decided they would buy a bunch of effects pedals and try to sing like Freddy Mercury.  Give me a break, you other people reviewing this album are acting like this is some revolutionary record.  This band is actually a complete joke, just like sparta and at the drive in.  When are these crap emo, sreamo garbage bands going to realise they aren't good??????  Good music is coming back, it should be here in about 2 years.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban amazes me more and more with each song on the CD.  His voice is absolutely amazing.  It is a must have for classic music lovers.
B00008J4P5|5.0|i herd so much about this album and as i do with every album i buy i make a calculated purchase. when i first listened to this album i didnt really like it at all but after 1 maybe 2 more listens it really grew on me and i got used to it-im only 15 and havnt really herd that style of music much before- whereas my dad like it first time but anyway now its one of my favourite album<br />each song has its own feel, uniqness and qaulity to it leaving you satisfies thouroughly at the end. the addictive soft notes and chord changes on the guitar, the powerful riffs jack rips out and the great beats meg gets out of the drum all combine extreeeemmly well( im listening to it now)<br />now white stripes are one of my favourite bands along with Linkin park, Nirvana, Coldplay RHCP and rage against the machine ( wat a range)
B00006AW2O|4.0|Between January 28, 1963 and December 8, 1965 The Rolling Stones recorded around 150 songs, amazing for the time, unheard of today. This unbridled fertility had it's ups and downs as is witnessed by \\"12 X 5\\". Kicking off with the Chuck Berry stalwart \\"Around And Around\\", recorded on the hallowed ground of Chess Studios, we are treated to a band whose confidence level is surging. Half of the twelve songs on \\"12 X 5\\" were recorded at Chess Studios the others being: \\"Confessin' The Blues\\", \\"Empty Heart\\", \\"It's All Over Now\\", \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\", and \\"If You Need Me\\". These Chess Recordings comprise most of the strongest material on \\"12 X 5\\" leaving much of the remainder of the album (recorded at Regent, IBC, London) to sound weak and unfocused. <br />Back to the good stuff, \\"Confessin' The Blues\\" a blues standard of sorts, continues to blow me away some 30 years after first hearing it. The band is at full nick on this recording with Mick singing some of his best blues, Keith's guitar is searing, Brian's harp playing is unmatched, and the Charlie & Bill's rhythm section is air tight. \\"Empty Heart\\" (a band compostion) is a rollicking soul number in which you can feel the inspiration flowing from the walls of Chess Studios. What else can be said about \\"Time Is On My Side\\"? One of the two good songs on the album recorded in London it stands in grandeur as the first Stones' classic. \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" (Jagger/Richards)the other good song recorded in London is a semi-acoustic slow blues that simmers throughout, and is aided and abetted by some more of Brian's great harp playing. \\"It's All Over Now\\" with it's thundering openning riff and great guitar interplay between Messrs. Jones and Richards was the second classic to come out of \\"12 X 5\\". <br />Side two starts with an interesting instrumental entitled \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\" (the then address of Chess Records). Alas we run into into some quicksand, \\"Under The Boardwalk\\", \\"Congratulations\\", and \\"Grown UpAll Wrong\\" would have all been great on a \\"rarities\\" album, however here the don't stand up to what we've heard on side 1 (however Brian's slide work on \\"Grown Up..\\" is killer). \\"If You Need Me\\" the Wilson Pickett song is another great soul burner, and again benefits from having been recorded at Chess. \\"Susie Q\\" rocks out and closes an album that is a near miss, but a must have.<br />The Rolling Stones recorded a total of 25 songs at Chess Studios on between 1964 and 1965 six of which have never been officially released. Hopefully ABKCO will continue to revive the Stones recordings it owns the rights to and release a \\"Rolling Stones: Chess Sessions\\" CD.
B0000026NC|4.0|There are numerous reasons to give this live double CD less than five stars, but in spite of those reasons I've listened to this CD for two days straight, at least ten times.  While the CD may have its flaws, the dark, brooding sound and heavy wallowing bass matched my mood, and reminded me once more of Pink Floyd's eminence in Progressive Rock.<br />I have the advantage of being unfamiliar with Floyd's first live album, thus not having a comparison point.  Comparing this album to the other live albums I've heard, the principal thing I noticed was that the crowd noise was reasonably minimal.  Second, the bass is very heavy and either represents the mixing or the way Floyd plays in concert.  I suspect that at least some of the bass is due to the mixing since one effect of the deeper bass would be to mute the crowd sound somewhat.  The result is a live album that nearly has a studio album feel to it.<br />As for the songs themselves, many of them come across very well.  I particularly like \\"The Dogs of War\\" and \\"Run like Hell,\\" but many of the other songs come across quite nicely as well.  The live versions of the songs from \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" I thought were interesting and serviceable.  Admittedly the sound is different without Roger Waters, but the songs still come across with the distinctive Pink Floyd sound.<br />Other reviewers have commented on the saxophone and the female backup singers.  Being a fan of the saxophone I thought the sax on the songs helped distinguish the songs from the studio albums.  I generally expect live versions to be different from studio versions.  Sometimes the live version works well, other times not.  In this case I enjoyed the unique contributions of the saxophone.  As for the female backup singers, there are a few places where they are a bit obtrusive and add little to the songs, but fortunately those places are relatively few.<br />The difficulty with recommending this CD is that Pink Floyd fans are technically astute people, and I think many Floyd fans will prefer the mathematical precision of a studio album over a loosely choreographed live album.  Pink Floyd's music is well arranged and created in the fashion of classical music and the extrinsic distractions of crowd noise and special effects can spoil the effect for some fans.  I enjoy the variations from the studio albums, and the generally low crowd noise was not a distraction to me.  If you are seeking an album to relive a live Floyd experience, sans Roger Waters, this album is a good one.  If you are looking for a collection of Pink Floyd's best through the time of \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" but are not particularly interested in a live album, then you may want to pass this one by.nd I think many Floyd fans will prefer the mathematical precision of a studio album over a loosely choreographed live album.

B00006690G|5.0|Eminem's third commercial record, The Eminem Show, has shown to everyone Marshall's talent (atleast for those who still didn't know it), it has shown that Marshall is a real legend in Hip-Hop. He has mastered his gift to write rhymes, who was still a little weak in Slim Shady LP, and great in Marshall Mathers' LP.<BR>Every song in here is good, I mean, every song has some good rhymes, good beats, everything is cool, some songs, obviously, are better than others.<BR>My favorite songs in here are &quot;Till I Collapse&quot;, who has some of the greatest rhymes  ever recorded, &quot;Sing For The Moment&quot;, who leaves us a great message, the first time Marshall really sings, which is in &quot;Hailie's Song&quot;... Well, I'd spend many lines in here telling you what I think of each song, but the important is the record itself. Is it good? Is it worth my money?<BR>Yes, overall this is a record for music fans, not only for rap fans. If you don't like cussing, go ahead and buy the Clean Version or something, but the important is: you, as a music fan, must own this album, which seems to be one of the most important albums in Hip-Hop. This isn't only cussing, this is rap as an art, something you must pay attention to, something you must listen carefully.<BR>You may don't like Eminem because of his attitudes or some violent songs he writes. But this album, &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;, must be bought and listened carefully by everyone out there, because there are many, many people cussing Eminem without knowing what he's really about, without knowing his work (this includes you, Juggalos, don't be dissing Eminem just because he dissed your favorite band, grow up!). And those guys in general must really shut the f*** up, because they don't know what they're talking about. I met no one who, after listening to this album, didnt respect Marshall. Give him a try and change your mind.
0385504209|5.0|I think that people are forgetting that this is a novel. This is fiction, not fact, it's just something fun to read, and in that respect it is wonderful. Dan Brown does not pretend that everything that he presents is sound fact, rather he includes a page in the beginning outlining what is fact. Do not confuse this with a historical document, but along the same lines, don't expect this to be historically accurate. What is historically accurate anyway? It is good read, hard to put down, and I loved it.
B0000648WZ|1.0|No words can explain the disgrace with which this director should feel in the making of such a horrible movie.  The original book was excellent, written by an extremely gifted author, Robert Heinlein.  The director of this movie has seen fit to completely disrespect Mr. Heinlein by making a movie that is based on the book in title only.  I watched this movie in pain and awe at its absurdity.  They could have followed the book and made a science fiction movie to rival any that has ever been put out, but instead decided to mutilate this one into oblivion.<br />The people that put this movie together should be ashamed of themselves.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Every track on this CD is good. This is the perfect complement to The Chronic. Both albums define the very nature of what G-Funk and rap are all about. It's produced by Dr. Dre, and his influence is seen in every track through incredibly irrestible beats (a la The Chronic). This CD has some of the best beats ever heard on a rap album, combined with incredible lyrics and Snoop's best style. Guest appearances from The Dogg Pound rappers are excellent, and this is by far Snoop's best rapping.<br />This CD CANNOT be compared to any other Snoop Dogg CD; it surpasses any of his other albums with ease. There are so many classics on this album (\\"Gin and Juice,\\" \\"Murder Was the Case,\\" \\"Ain't No Fun,\\" \\"Tha Shiznit,\\" etc.) and the others, though less played, are equally as good. If you liked The Chronic (in other words, if you like real rap with incredible beats and lyrics) then buy this album. It will not disappoint. This goes along perfectly with The Chronic and many debate which album is better. Either way, you cannot lose with this album: It is easily one of the best rap albums EVER.

When I bought the CD I was thinking I could add a tool to my audio library and have more constant exposure to the concepts. But no<br />This audio was worse than my grade school educational film series. The reader is dull, boring and almost put me to sleep in the car. This is GREAT material. Everyone that is considering any of the books I would heartily give them a 5 of 5 stars. <br />I fast forwarded through the entire first cd, hoping that I would start hearing the same &quot;meat&quot; I read about in SPIN. What Iheard was a lot of &quot;pre-program&quot; dialog. <br />If I could speak with Neil Rakham I would say, &quot;Neil, this is an outstanding program. Please get a reader with more emotion&quot;.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|This seems to be the type of score that people either love or hate.  However, I'm in neither camp, but rather somewhere in the middle.<br />On the plus side, the performances are quite wonderful, and the choral work is outstanding.   Several of the songs are memorable, including &quot;Popular,&quot; &quot;What Is this Feeling,&quot; and &quot;I'm Not that Girl.&quot;<br />On the negative side, there is a sameness to much of the music, mostly due to the orchestrations, and some less-than-terrific tunesmithing on the part of Stephen Schwartz. <br />A very major problem is the lack of a printed plot synopsis.  For those who haven't seen the production, trying to figure out who's singing what (and why) will be a problem.  NO cast recording should be issued without at least a brief plot outline. For a show as complex as this one, this is a major oversight. (There are some websites with this information, but that's no excuse.)<br />I suspect that this show works better in the theatre than in does here.  I know there are many passionate admirers of the show, but I can't count myself as one of them.
B00000K31V|4.0|Every once in awhile when I am feeling reflective I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. I have seen quite a few of them at this point, from some of his earliest stuff like &quot;Shivers&quot; to his seminal reworking of &quot;The Fly&quot; starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get out of a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, usually served with a generous helping of gore. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs, messing around with human genetics, or plugging game units into our spinal cords may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is almost a sequel to his masterful early 1980's effort &quot;Videodrome.&quot; Whereas &quot;Videodrome&quot; dealt with the addictive and manipulative potentialities of television, &quot;eXistenZ&quot; warns about the addictive and manipulative potentialities of video games.<br />Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a top video game designer, is about to premier her latest efforts to a select gathering of techies and marketing schleps. Called eXistenZ, the game promises to blow every other previous effort out of the water, and the people in attendance at the debut of the game are beside themselves with joy. It is difficult to get so excited over a mere video game until we learn that the games these people play goes well beyond a television set and a joystick. In Geller's world, the games plug directly into the human brain via a bioport, or a hole in the base of the spinal column. The system connected to the spinal cord is a half-flesh/half machine game pod, a squishy, living organism sporting an umbilical cord attachment. The action starts when a person plugs in and uses their hands to manipulate this grotesque bag of skin. As for the program itself, well, it goes far beyond virtual reality to create a reality nearly identical to the one we see through our own eyes. Sure, there a few differences easily noticed by players, such as characters who repeat phrases until the player says the right thing to move the game along or weird little creatures that could never exist in reality, but eXistenZ is light years ahead of Donkey Kong.<br />Geller barely fires up eXistenZ before a nut in the audience attempts to kill her with a weird gun fashioned out of bones that uses teeth for bullets (!). Allegra flees the chaotic scene with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a public relations gopher, and the two head to a hotel out in the sticks until they can figure what the heck is going on. Geller's astonishment about Pikul's lack of a game port leads the two to an out of the way gas station where a guy named Gas (Willem Dafoe) installs unregistered bioports for a fee. More weirdness ensues when Gas makes an attempt on Geller's life, fortunately thwarted by Pikul, and the two confused fugitives head even deeper into the woods to a pod repair shop run by a couple of Geller's old friends. As if it couldn't get any stranger, Pikul and Geller at this point plug into eXistenZ in earnest and are rapidly propelled through a series of strange scenarios involving a Chinese restaurant, a really disgusting meal, one of those strange bone guns, a pod manufacturing plant, and a conspiracy concerning Geller's invention. You are never quite sure when Geller and Pikul are in the game or in reality, which makes the movie quite confusing at times. About the only thing that really makes sense is the conclusion of the film, an ending I will not spoil except to say that it was quite a twist and one which I did not see coming. I probably didn't pick up on the numerous clues throughout the movie because I spent too much time soaking in all of the epic weirdness going on every few minutes.<br />I always enjoy a Cronenberg film, but the real reason I liked this film was the presence of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Although I have heard several things about her that are slightly off putting, I think she's a real cutie who only gets better with age. I also admire the risks she has taken with some of her roles over the years. I couldn't help but draw a comparison several times in &quot;eXistenZ&quot; between Leigh now and Leigh when she starred in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; two decades ago. She's definitely attained a greater range since the early 1980s, and she is much, much prettier as an older woman. At one point in the film the script calls for Allegra Geller to cradle an assault weapon while talking to Pikul, a very short scene that reveals how stunning Leigh is even while toting military hardware. As for Jude Law and Willem Dafoe, they do an adequate job with what they have to work with here. &quot;eXistenZ&quot; ultimately focuses more on the twisty plot and the oddball effects than it does with character development. &quot;eXistenZ&quot; is not David Cronenberg's best film, but it is an entertaining romp through employing his usual themes. The DVD has no extras except for a trailer, disappointingly, but the movie is in widescreen and the quality is excellent. Here's to a long career for Cronenberg, a man who has brought up plenty of wild and wacky films and who will hopefully bring us a few more in the future.not see coming.

B00005JGAB|5.0|This 26-minute exercise in manic beats, furious guitar propulsion and brilliant vocals struck a chord (if you will) upon its 1976 release, and would go on to influence many different genres of many different artists. As the wonderful liner notes say, this album was borne out of alienation from the rock scene of the time: wankerous guitar solos, style over substance, all show no go. Tommy, Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee paid $6,000 dollars to record this album and go down in rock history. If you have not heard this album before, you are missing out: every song is a perfect snapshot of teenage alienation and rebellion, and are infinitely entertaining. Joey's vocals in particular stand out thanks to his ridiculous faux-British accent and intonations. Listen to &quot;Havana Affair&quot; for further proof (I used to make a living man, picking the banana). With this expanded edition of additional tracks and demos, you really get an idea of how this modern masterpiece came together, and is an indispensable addition to any self-respecting CD collection. Hey ho, let's go!
038572179X|3.0|Highly acclaimed.. but oh so BORING!  Although McEwan is a good writer, and he<br />describes very well how writers perceive the world.  That's what I liked about<br />this book.  Also, in the last few pages, a &quot;surprise&quot; ending that is really<br />unexpected.<br />Briony Tallis, 13, aspiring writer, sees something she's not meant to see...<br />and then proceeds to change her and her family's lives and futures.<br />Hard to describe this one without spoilers!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you're a fan of pop music, then you are bound to love this album!  It's an eclectic collection of dance music, ranging from the funky and edgy \\"Toxic\\" to the sultry and sexy \\"Breathe on Me\\" &  \\"Touch of My Hand.\\"  There are so many different sounds on this album that you're bound to find something you like.  I highly recommend this cd, and this is coming from someone who had never previously considered purchasing something from Britney.  I've gotta give her credit because this is one brilliant album!!
B00005U11Z|4.0|This is a really well produced DVD. I was very impressed with the quality especially the sound. Neal really performs well like always and its cool to see the band back together again. Steve Augeri is a good singer but just cant reach the high notes and doesnt show the emotion of Steve Perry. Steve had a way of singing songs that made you get goose bumps and your hair to stand on end! It's really weird to see the band playing such small venues now compared to the 40-80,000 seat stadiums they played at well into the late eighties. What happened to the unique lighting that was used in the raised on radio concert?? The triangular looking lighting panels that changed colors and brightness used mostly in the Girl Can't Help It video and I'll Be Alright Without You videos. Did anyone notice this big change in lighting???<br />Being a huge Journey fan I couldnt resist this DVD even if it was unfortunatly without Steve Perry. I reccommend it to anyone who enjoys the music of Journey.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Thanks, Hollywood, for remembering that while we baby-boomers are not your prime demographic we are still around and yearning for a great movie like this to make us laugh all the way to retirement.<br />Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are fabulous playing roles not that far removed from their real lives.  Jack is Harry Sanborn, a sixty-three year old entrepreneur who doesn't believe in dating anyone under thirty.  Diane is Erica Barry, a highly successful playwright (\\"the best since Lillian Hellman\\") who has had an emotional shutdown since her divorce.  Romance and sex are not even options for her and Harry is not at all attractive when she first meets him half-naked while he is preparing to bed her daughter.  Their relationship is best described as intense dislike at first sight but when he accidentally see her naked, it goes to full-out hate!<br />You might have a good guess as to how this will turn out, but there are so many twists along the way you might not get exactly what you were expecting.  What you will get is a great, feel-good movie to have you laughing a lot and thinking \\"how true, how true.\\"  When the relationship hits the rocks, Erica is able to turn her humiliation and rejection into a Broadway hit that features a male chorus line of Dancing Harrys replete in hospital gowns with peek-a-boo backs as well as every romantic and not-so-romantic line Harry ever uttered to her.<br />Keanu Reeves is a most delectable piece of eye candy, but it is Frances McDormand as Erica's sister Zoe and Amanda Peet as her daughter Marin who give great supporting performances.  Also good to see Paul Michael Glaser, albeit in a very small role.<br />If you're under thirty, just tell your Mom and Dad to see it.  But if you're over 40, don't miss this.  Hollywood may not permit us to see the likes of it again.
B00000JY1X|5.0|This is my first foray into the world of Stephin Merritt.  I am completely hooked.  I took a huge chance and purchased the box set with nothing more than the Amazon sound-bytes/samples and I am so pleased!  The reviewers did not let me down on this one!<br />There is such a huge range of styles in these songs, with lots of whimsy and tongue-in-cheekiness to boot.  Beautiful, imaginative melodies, a nice array of instrumentations, enigmatic lyricism - - happy, sad, cynical, and indifferent - -just like love itself!<br />I don't think I can pick a favorite, they are all catchy, worthwhile ventures, and with all the variety in themes, my favorites change with my moods.  Sometimes it's the plaintive ones - 'Come Back from San Francisco', 'I Don't Want to Get Over You'; sometimes the unrequited ones - 'The Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side'; and sometimes it's the fun, randy ones - 'Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits'.  And that's just the first disc!<br />The booklet that comes with the box set is also quite entertaining and informative.  If you prefer your pop to have some semblance of intelligence, some semblance of talent and musicianship, then this is definitely for you.  If you prefer the drivel on the radio, maybe not.
