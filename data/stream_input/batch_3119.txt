B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|YES FINALLY TERRARIA IS OUT ON KINDLE I SAW MY FRIENDS PLAY THIS ON THEIR IPHONES AND I WAS ANGRY FOR THIS NOT BEING ON A KINDLE BUT ITS FINALLY HERE GET IT!!!!!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I had a great ride with the first four books of this series.  The books filled in some gaps left by the tv series.  I loved the complexity of the characters  and the vividness of the world that the author creates.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you kindle,finally got candy crush saga game.it's such a great game.I enjoy playing this game a lot.love the game.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I perhaps shouldn't rate this book, since I stopped reading about 100 pages in.  I was bored!  I may revisit it sometime, but I think the core four books were far superior.
B000LB7G00|5.0|i'm extremely happy with this product, learning curve is a day. Works best with Adobe Products but it was fine in others such as Cinema 4D, and Modo. Perfect in Cryengine, not so much right away in UDK and PhotoShop 3D.... Of course it's amazing in Solidworks and Rhino..... I love this product I will definitely upgrade later!
B000I186FW|5.0|It is a gripping story, well told, with graphically interesting design, in chiaroscuro and employs good actors at the revealing junctures.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This helps so that your device doesn't freeze or be slow. One of my<br /> friends recommend it to me. It takes only a minute or quicker
B005IQ39AY|3.0|It is okay for what it is, a time waster. it's definitely not a game that you can't wait to get back to. but it kills time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book. Loved all the interesting neurotic characters. This novel was filled with surprises and many twists and turns. Enjoyed reading it very much.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It's a good thing to play on the Kindle rather than a phone as you can see what you are doing better, but that is just my opinion. All in all a fun game.
B00BC254I8|5.0|This is a tough read.  Mike's had a tough life, but there is a lot of wisdom in his words.  I honestly wondered if people who grow up like him, on the streets, practically feral, might prefer the jails because there is finally structure.  It's a brutally honest look into a life so different from mine.  Interestingly, we were born the same year, so all things considered, he just got the short straw when it came to parents.  I am so glad to see how far he's come.  His awakenings are hard-won. He can look back on such a harsh history (I think worse than \\"The Glass Castle\\" for upbringings) and see the light.  Really interesting read and I've never watched a boxing match in my life.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This was the first Angry Birds game I tried. It was free so I thought, why not. I think the graphics and sounds are good. The game itself is entertaining. I am not the best at video games, so it takes me a while to proceed to the next levels, but I like it.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|season 4: a group of good actors given horrific (as in BAD) scripts coupled with lackluster direction.  Kill this sucker and be done with it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really like this game, It sounded like it might be kind of boring, but it is not. it is fun to have to think and plan out your attack. The higher levels do get more tricky, but you can find some forums online with tips from more experienced players.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|If you are in the New York Metro area, you MUST take a field trip to the Frick Museum to see \\"The Goldfinch\\" for yourself .... what an amazing opportunity!!!!  The painting is part of a traveling exhibit and will be here until January 19th.  I recommend seeing it before, during or after your read.  Tartt does an incredible job capturing its magic but, as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words ... seeing this in person was better than any \\"celebrity sighting\\" I've seen.  Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you are not able to get to the museum, at the very least I recommend googleing the painting.  It will add a lot to the whole experience ..... btw, the book is a complete joy.  Brava! Brava!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like all the free angry birds games, so I am very happy with this one. I am not so good at video games, but it's a nice app to have when you are bored.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The acting was superb. The action scenes were great. The special effects were amazing. Great character development. Javier Bardem was creepy. Naomie Harris was sexy. Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney were great co-stars. All-in-all this movie was fantastic. It is borderline 2.5hrs long, but doesn't feel like a long movie. It keeps you entertained and interested throughout the entire film. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like that this one is add-free. It is as good as all the other Angry Birds and is fun to have on hand when you are bored.
098555780X|5.0|This book has some really interesting patterns and great instructions! I bought about 4 books, and this one has proved to be the best one, I think.
B0041D843M|4.0|My boss recommended this to me and I sort of bought to appease him, but I think it is very interesting and has some great information, Definitely a worth while read.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Great melodies and sounds from the master. The album does not disappoint.<br />It's a modern sounding album and you can tell it just wasn't put<br />together. I believe it will rank up there with his best. Maybe not<br />as great as Band on the Run... but on par with RAM.<br />Ta, Cheers, you've got a lucky face.
B00CFOGCAG|4.0|I like this game. It has a fun retro video game feel and the different levels are fun. It's fun when you are bored.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Pinterest works almost flawlessly on my iphone and computer, but is way clumsy on my kindle fire HD. It crashes quite a bit and has a bunch of bugs related to pinning. If I am in the app and try to pin, it will crash when it tries to look up my boards (almost every time). Trying to pin from an external site is equally as clumsy and I run into the same bugs. This is a bummer because I bought the kindle as an affordable alternative to the iPad and my biggest app obsession is pinterest. Wish it worked.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a really great idea.  It streams Hulu, Netflix, Pandora, and Youtube for me.  Also Will mirror my Chrome Browser on my PC. Works well now and still has tons of room for growth with programmers creating compatible apps for it. Reason for 4/5 is because Google has closed open source for developers for now.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Looks Good<br />- Easy to use and Install<br />- Very Portable<br /><br />Cons<br />- Needed a computer to set up originally<br />- Google has to approve apps before they work with it ( Hopefully this will change soon)
1451627297|5.0|Wonderful departure from King's usual style.  He obviously did a lot of historical research.  I loved premise of what if you could go back in time and change an horrific event . . . and what would be the consequences.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love the game!!! I can sit and play and lose track of time. Just be patient and don't rush it and you can play for hours.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Very interesting story. Lots of beautiful scenery and wonderful story. My whole family loved watching and we have watched it a couple of times now.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This is another great game I know that you'll like to play.<br /><br />It's a bit more difficult, but terrific point and click adventure all the same.<br /><br />I'm  among the fans of Big Fish games and I buy them before I even start.  I'm having trouble with my kindle writing this,so good luck :-)
B00CHVJODE|5.0|family movie - my kids my grandkids and my great grandkids all got lots of laughs from watching this movie.  A +++
B009LDD4V4|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my sister - and she was delighted to receive it. That makes my day as she is difficult to buy for. :)
1609613937|5.0|Great book. You have no hunger and still lose weight. Easy to follow was a raw foodist before and was always hungry.
0920668372|5.0|This book is perfect for parents and grandparents new and old. The overwhelming love for a child is beautifully expressed. I bought several to give as gifts.
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|I think this could have a great movie had there been more information, more definition.  The rift between them over the drugs made liberace seem to USE that as an excuse for a breakup, maybe that was the intent, but the lover blamed liberace FOR getting hooked.....so I wish there had been more dialogue ,emotional, deep dialogue between them on screen about that relationship, and each ones' role in that situation.  BUT, scott was told in the beginning that liberace would toss him out !
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A book that broke down convention at every turn. Richly drawn characters brought a plethora of emotions and experiences to life. An excellent str
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A beautiful story that makes you look at those with disabilities in a whole new light! loved the characters! a tearjerker from start to finish.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|What a book. I recommend this to every serious fiction reader. You will not be disappointed. You will be on the edge of your seat awaiting the third book coming in 2014.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a teenager in high school, and I remember every detail of that day and the days after so vividly! My family and I just sat in front of the television hour after hour just listening to the news.<br />This book brought back so many memories of not only that day but of life in the sixties!!!<br />This is the first book I've ever read by Stephen King. A friend of mine suggested this and my first reaction was &#34;Oh no I don't read his books! too creepy&#34;! but she convinced me that this was nothing like his normal novels.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and all the characters in it. I wish we could go back in time and fix this country!<br />It really makes you think, if the events didn't unfold as they did what would be happening in our country today??? Would we<br />be better off???
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It's a little too much. The series as a whole is too much like 50 shades. Perfect people, perfect Sex, perfect lives, perfectly dysfunctional together, blah. The way she ended this one sucked. I keep reading them just to see how it ends.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a great game, it's easy to learn and loads of fun no matter how many you play with!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am in total awe if this series. It's breathtaking. The characters are amazing. There is so much heart in this book. I can't wait to read more Veronica Roth books!
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|Absolutely loved Divergent and enjoyed Insurgent, although not as much.  After about 200 pages, I was easily able to put Allegiant down - FOR OVER A WEEK.  By that point, I knew where the story line was going and it was not interesting to read.  I only finished the book because my 14 year old daughter said I would regret it if I did not finish the trilogy.<br /><br />Now that I have finished reading it, I actually regret reading Allegiant.  It has ruined Divergent for me.  I love reading, read a lot as a teen, and have read literally hundreds of chapter books to my five children over the years.  I can only think of three other books that top this one, with regard to the feeling that I simply slogged through to the end, so that I could be done with the misery of reading the book.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|I bought this for my 10 year old son he loves to play with the lego and pc version its so cool!!!!! When he's at school i love to give it to him when he gets back. I say its good for kids 8 to 13 and it does not fall apart you have to like punch it to make it fall.
B0091XEW9M|5.0|The movie has so much more to it than most people realize.  For viewing purposes, it has action for some and romance for others.  There's the overtone of a revolutionary moment that I think is rare to glimpse in a film anymore.<br /><br />Always a favorite and I watch it every Nov 5.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Great read. Very insightful. Taught me how creativity and believing in one's self can change reality. A must read if bored with life.
B0007939NO|5.0|Loved this movie proud to own it and happy with service. Would recommend to my friends. Hope that more choose this
B00G3DA5XA|5.0|The Spectacular Now is a film adaptation of the popular novel by the same name from author Tim Tharp. The film follows the book fairly closely and is about a popular boy, Sutter Keely, who likes to party way too much, and a shy straight-arrow girl, Aimee, who befriends Sutter and then falls for him. It is at first a very unlikely coupling but Sutter and Aimee grow on each other, each getting something from the other that they couldn't have found on their own. The story follows the young romance as it strengthens and gently unwinds, as most young romances do, because sometimes what you each come to the other as is what you end up remaining, no matter what kind of influences enter your life. I love that the ending is realistic.<br /><br />The actors couldn't have been more perfect. Miles Teller was so good in Rabbit Hole and he brings to life an entirely different personality here and is a perfect casting. Shailene Woodley was incredible in another of my favorite films, The Descendants, and she too plays a quite different character in The Spectacular Now and so believably so.<br /><br />I found this film about teens refreshing. For once, kids from blue-collar existences and not upper-middle-class homes are portrayed. And for a change, cookie-cutter characters are nowhere to be found. The \\"stoner,\\" \\"goody two-shoes,\\"  \\"jock\\" and \\"class clown\\" are here, for sure, but as with real people in real life they are fleshed out to portray people with more than one dimension.<br /><br />There's an excellent supporting cast, especially Kyle Chandler as Sutter's dad.<br /><br />This film gets you to thinking--or rethinking--about your teen years and where you may--or may not--have fit in. When the ending comes it may take some people by surprise but it weaves in nicely and believably into the web cast by the characters from the beginning of the film.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|If you are into action and special effects, then this is a must see movie. When compared to other Star Treks the movie was painful to watch. The plot did not make sense. Why would Spock Prime make an appearance in such an illogical movie? Oh, I forgot he's played by a human actor who is not as logical as Mr Spock. Now that makes sense.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Another beyond amazing from Eminem. To actually listen to the songs, the lyrics and hear the genius of it all. then you throw the beats on top of it.... off the charts album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FAVORITE GAME IS SO ADDICTING EVEN GOT MY MOM AND AUNT ADDICTED TO THIS GAME ESPECIALLY MY MOM WE ALL LOVE IT
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I love this book!  Her command of prose and subject matter--botany-elevates this book to a new level.  She is a wonderful writer--I can't imagine the research necessary to write a book like this..
B000TNI370|5.0|This little guy is super cute, I enjoy having him as a desk buddy at work. The measurements that Amazon has is accurate!
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Share this one with your Tweens. It may help them get a moment of perspective. Read it yourself to give you hope.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ten years since I last read Ender's Game and it's still a joy to read. Still found it full of fun concepts to stretch one's imagination.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Keeps you guessing all the way through.  You never really know who is lying and who is telling the truth or even if there is any truth at all.  They are both crazy so it is just which one can be more convincing than the other.  Poor kid being born into that sick family, they are toxic.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|The very title of this album is ridiculous, and it's just very easy to spoof. \\"Artpop?\\" More like \\"FArtpop.\\" *bah-bah-dum-TSHH!*<br /><br />Look, it's the same old vapid, pointless, shallow syrup that she's always done. I'll give her props for consistency! This should definitely be her career-ending flop, which I'm awaiting with bated breath. If this album succeeds like her first one, I'm going to lose what little faith in humanity I have left. But, if you look it up, you'll see that her previous album took a noticeable dive in sales, compared to the previous one. I'm hoping this one starts where the last one left off and sinks MUCH further down.<br /><br />And some reviewers are calling this the album of the year!! Oh, THE HUMANITY!! Clearly, the poor saps don't have a mind of their own, only listening to what corporations tell them to listen to. Only an abysmal level of ignorance can lead anyone to declare this as the album of the year. That honor would have to go to Tarja Turunen. [[ASIN:B00DOQK2AK Colours in the Dark]]<br /><br />In summary: This is more of the same, it should flop miserably, and we should never hear from this atrocious \\"artist\\" again. Amen.
B00EJ9RIXA|4.0|I only use this on my mobile devices to access files created on my computer, which it does very well.  My only complaint about the useability is that it orders things by most recent access, not in alphabetical order.  That could probably be changed, but I haven't really looked into it.  I haven't tried to modify documents, but I wouldn't really expect it to be easy on a tablet.  I give it 4 stars because the exact same app for Apple is free.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Late to the party with Band Of Horses and happy it's not over. Every song rings true and sounds fresh each time I listen, and deeper cuts take only a few plays to become favorites. There is not a clunker on this disc -- buy it and the rest of the catalog (like I'm about to!)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is grate its controls are easy and its really easy to upgrade your robot at the beginning of the game
B003U51EE8|5.0|Love it!  I'm on to season 4!  Finished season 4 and started on 5! Great streaming and great sound !
B000A0GP18|5.0|This is truly a good, funny movie with a lot of good actors in it. It could be watched multiple times and never get  old.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This Book provided an insight into War that shows with some individuals mercy and integrity still can exist even under Nazism.
630529142X|4.0|This movie is funny. Another funny football movie. Teenage boys seem to enjoy it. It comes on TV quit often.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Been a Star Trek fan since the TV series in the 1960's. It was a lot of fun to watch.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this show. I have watched it several times. Sad to know next season, (season 7) will be its last.
1439190275|5.0|If you are serious about loosing those extra pounds, then following this guy diet program is your solution. Now remember that you also have to do some exercise and follow to the letter what the program says. You will see results soon enough, believe me... it does work!!! :)
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|best 3D not named avatar. first time since avatar that i was impressed with the 3D.. As far as the movie goes. love the reboot. lots of fun
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is the first for pleasure book I've read in a long time and I really enjoyed it.  From reading other's reviews, I can understand some of the weak points, but overall this is a great read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book!! Once I gott into the characters I didn't want to put the book down!  I Hope the author does a continuation of the story!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|A wonderful movie! Lots of fun for everyone! The deleted and behind the scenes were great. I love the combo pack as well!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|In John Grisham style  a &#34;not put down able&#34; book. Read it in two sittings would have been one if I did not have a plane to catch.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I want the old app back.  It was more user friendly without a bunch of garbage that I don't need or want.
B001609SQA|5.0|Aliens, is one of my favorite films.  It is NOT what I consider a &#34;groundbreaking classic&#34; as was it's predecessor.<br />It is a sequel, but it's a good sequel.<br />Why do I like it?<br />1. It's exciting.  It has all the screams and edge-of-your-seat excitement of Alien1 and arguably more due to the number of monsters.  There's plently of action throughout most of the film.<br />2. It's a story of survival.  Survival stories tug at the core of human existence.  In that regard, you can't help but be &#34;interested&#34; at least.  In this case, the stakes are high because the fate of the losers is one &#34;worse than death&#34;(spoken in a deep voice).<br />3. It's a story of teamwork and loyalty.  The players must band together to survive against the odds.  The players look inside themselves, realize their faults and concentrate on their strengths to support the team.  One overriding theme in the film is the charactors' loyalty to eachother.  They are each willing to lay down their lives for their comrades.  This loyalty is contrasted in the &#34;company representative&#34; charactor and his fate sends a chilling message to viewers about this behavior.<br />4. Memorable Classic Lines.  I enjoy films that have what I call, &#34;classic lines&#34;.  e.g. Jaws.  Jaws is one lone classic line.  LOL.<br />This film has many.  I personally enjoyed the sergeant's lines about &#34;the corps&#34; when they are waking up.  Bill Paxton, who I find utterly obnoxious in most of his rolls, has a few good ones.  His, &#34;why don't you put her in charge?&#34; is a scream.<br />5. Good clean fun?  Compared to recent films, this film is just that.  While so-called modern films boast fantastic computer generated graphics and sound etc sadly, they are also characterised by overt sadism, violence and lewdness(yes, lewdness).  This film was made in good old 1980's before all that &#34;modern&#34; behavior became acceptable in our living rooms.<br />6. Good musical score - nuffsaid<br />Why DON'T I like it?<br />1. Sigourney Weaver is just too harsh for me.  Her feigned attempt at manhood is tiring.  I can't help but bust out laughing when I watch her say to the queen alien &#34;you get away from her, you b&*$h!&#34;  Really?  Not to mention, she could have simply taken the girl and left without being noticed.  Her &#34;manhood&#34; almost ruins both her, the girl and Bishop's chances escape.  To her credit, the scene with Sig operating the loader against the creature is both exciting and believable.  &#34;Not bad for a human&#34;, did I mention the classic lines?<br />2. The charactors are basal in nature.  I don't know who they were trying to impress in this regard.  This is typical of this (and other) genres when applied to the B movie class.  I guess that's WHY it's a B movie LOL.  Certainly, if I were a U.S. marine, I'd be insulted to say the least.  I just can't help wondering why a corporation would entrust billions of dollars in equipment to such a bunch of boobs?
0449237567|5.0|Very fun book. I enjoyed it! What I loved the most about it, it give a different point of view of how deadly the human ego can be. We will be right no matter what, even if it costs everyone their lives. Also, give a good view of what life may be like in other universes. Well written. If you are looking for violence and action, you will probably not like it much, as there isn't any. If you are looking for a good psychological storyline, and enjoy observing human nature at it's best and worst, you'll find this a fun read. Recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the arena and the action so far best book in series and I mean it. I highly suggest this book for some one who does not gross out easily and likes action, blood, and killing.
B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|As a simple calculator, it's nice, but there are no specific redeeming qualities that make it stand out.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*The biggest pro is the display and ability to edit on-screen<br />*No rounding errors (that I could find)<br />*Fast<br />*Easy permissions<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The most blaring omission is memory storage; there is only one (-1 star)<br />*Lack of abilities beyond simple calculations<br />*Developer wants $1.09 more than I would be willing to pay ($.99 would be much more acceptable, -1 star)<br /><br />I would never have purchased this app (at its asking price) if it were not the FAotD, though if you do not already have a simple calculator (I keep different calculators for different purposes), you could do worse.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you catch this calculator as the FAotD and need one for quick, uncluttered calculations, go ahead and grab it.  If you already have a good, fast, 4-function calculator that you are happy with and used to, keep moving, there's nothing special to see here!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome book.  Can't wait for the movie to come out! These true-life heroes are REAL superstars, not Hollywood inventions. A must read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is a good game to play when ever!I could not stop playing it after I stared it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):)&lt;3&lt;3
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|THIS STORY HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN WHO TRULY BELIEVES IN EDUCATION FOR ALL!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Compelling book that revealed the power of words to change a country as well as a little girl.  Particular insight given into the German psyche where there existed a willingness to follow absolutely and yet to suffer the humiliations and deprivations when personal choice was no longer an option. Good read!
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|I never watch old movies and I rarely read American Classics, but I've always loved the title Breakfast at Tiffany's so that's why I chose to read this novella. I really liked it and the short stories that followed. I was surprised by how risqu&eacute; it was for its time. I can't say I liked Holly all that much, but she is a very interesting character. I'm excited to watch the movie now!
B00DW1WR14|2.0|I love Pearl Jam, but after 30+ years of music they haven't changed anything. It's always the same old soup: same sounds, same riffs, no new ideas...
B008Y5NO5G|5.0|My absolute favorite movie of all time! My two little girls also fell in love with it!  Excellent music, too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it it a fun game... no glitches and always something to be doing. I highly recommend. Good kids game!
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Hits the core of why I want to practice medicine. Moved me to tears. Also very funny. Worthwhile to see.
1416909532|1.0|The book was beat up and used. I was promised a new copy. I'm weird about books, and this one urked me so bad, I trashed it.
0920236251|3.0|This is my favorite kids book, hands down. I buy it every time I need a present for a kid. It's just fun, entertaining, and the princess is bad ass and smart.<br />I was very disappointed with the size of the book though. I guess I should have looked at all the info, I just assumed it was the standard size. I got it as a gift for my niece and will need to order another copy as I felt bad giving her such a tiny book. It's about 3&#34; by 3&#34;. Very small.<br /><br />Update - 7/7/15<br />I bought this book again, making sure it was the standard size, and I'm very happy with it. Just double (and triple) check the size! It's a GREAT book -- excellent story of a smart princess. The exact opposite to Barbie and the Disney princesses.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Worth the money is easy to use and not very expensive, I use all the time. I would recommend this app/product
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fabulous show! Excellent character development, great story, well acted, beatutiful scenery and costuming and accurate portrayal of what was transpiring during that era.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season is a little slower than usual, but hey, still a great show.<br />Can't wait to see how it all ends.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|You have NEVER seen Hansel and Gretel like this! They a hardcore witch fighters who do not take hostages, curse, and are both very handsome. This is a must-see film.
1476727651|1.0|This is not a good novel. It is not in the least bit scary or creepy or anything you'd want from King. The villain of the book actually speaks the following dialog: \\"There's no crying in baseball.\\" Holy...<br /><br />I think the problem is, there's nobody surrounding King that is willing to tell him the truth. And why should they? His books sell. Why work too hard to make this one good when you could be working on the next big sale?<br /><br />This book is a corny mess.
B0047WNLJO|5.0|Vin Diesel is at his grittiness in this futuristic thriller! Vin Diesel is contracted to deliver a young woman with special powers to New York City with her caretaker, Michelle Yeoh. What the three travelers experience on their way to the Big Apple will have you on the edge of your seat. The ending will tug at your heart strings. Enjoy this Vin Diesel action thriller with music that truly rocks!!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|normally ever like slower songs. Nooow<br />they are my favorites.This album is fun<br />even though some of the lyrics are sad,<br />it's not as serious as Born This Way it's<br />just pure pop (with a little bit of Hip-Hop<br />& RnB :-D ) fun! Can't stop singing, can't<br />stop dancing. if you dont like SOMETHING on this album....its you, not the music
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This sequel to the previous Star Trek movie with Chris Pine as JT Kirk is fantastic as Kirk and his crew go after a rogue terrorist who is hell-bent on destroying the star fleet headquarters located in London during the star date 2259. Kirk and his crew face off in a &#34;dark&#34; region of space where Klingons rule and the battle is on! Loved this new Star Trek film and look forward to the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A different perspective in well written form.  So many have come in contact with kids in cancer, but rarely hear from them how they feel about it.  Good for high school - adult readers.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Brad Pitt plays a UN scientist who has come home to spend time with his wife and two daughters when a &#34;virus&#34; breaks out that causes people to turn to zombies, bite others, and on and on! &#34;Patient zero&#34; was never found, but Pitt (along with other scientists) figure out what makes the zombies tick and these zombies are unlike any other zombies in other zombie movies! The action is hard and in your face. The resolution is profound. Loved this movie!
B00ENYUFYU|3.0|JT shouldn't try the foreign language thing. The back and forth trying to kill each other didn't seem like real life.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This film had me jumping out of my seat. Daniel Radcliffe goes to settle an estate and finds more than he bargains for. A couple who had adopted a young boy unfortunately had to admit that they had never recovered his body. The birth mother of the dead boy hanged herself in her grief over the boy's death. The dead birth mother's ghost went on a rampage in the village - making young children do things that would ultimately and sometimes quickly kill themselves. The ending of this film will get to you! Oh Yes!! If you like a great scare, then this film is for you.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Insight into what it takes to be what he was. You don't find these kinds of guys at every corner.

B006BFK5DK|5.0|I am 47 years old and  EWF has been my favorite band since I was about 12 years old. They just keep getting better and they never disappoint. Their music to me is so inspirational. I've told my husband that if we ever hit the lottery, the first thing I would do would be to try to have them come to my city and have a private concert, just for family and friends,  I would happily write the check, no matter the cost. THIS CD IS FANTASTIC! Sign  On is my jam, and then it follows with Love Is Law, a beautiful ballad.  Beautiful from start to finish. LOVE IT!
1577314808|5.0|This is, for all intensive purposes \\"Today's Bible\\"... I recommend it to everyone I meet.  I have to give gratitude to Eckhart Tolle for all that he has done for so many people on the planet.  This book is the one you read when you are ready to end the suffering that ALL of us go through in life. Eloquently written in a way that guides you to your own understanding using your own internal \\"sign posts.\\" I always tell people if they get 40 pages in and haven't had an \\"OMG\\" moment then go back and read it again because your mind wandered off and you didn't get the \\"gold\\".  This is a must read for EVERYONE!

0765357151|5.0|When I first began to read I am Legend, it was for school and my father had recommended it. As a teenager, I naturally had little desire to read, not to mention I had previously seen the movie. However, as I delved into Richard Matheson's piece, I began to understand why Fangoria, a horror magazine specializing in books and films, called it \\"One of the Ten All-Time Best Novels of Vampirism.\\" The novel opens up in January of 1976 with the vampire plague in full swing. Robert Neville, our protagonist, is, or believes to be, the last human on Earth - everyone else have become vampires.<br /><br />The novel progresses along with Neville, as he is constantly harassed by the hordes of vampires who crave his blood. Neville barricaded his house and burned the neighboring ones in order to stay safe from the diseased. As Neville continues to live alone, his memories of the life he once had plague him. In multiple instances he turns to alcohol, which ends up doing more harm than good. Matheson writes so in depth that we the reader feel we are with Neville, sympathizing with him as he struggles. As Neville continues to live through the wasteland of society, he begins to search for a cure. Armed with textbooks, a microscope, and nothing to lose, Neville hunts for a cure of the bacterium, which he nicknames Vampiris. Can Neville find the cure? Is he truly alone?<br /><br />Ultimately, the writing style of Matheson leaves the reader almost as thirsty to continue as the vampires in his book are for blood. I couldn't put the book down once I started, which is a rarity for myself. If you're looking for a great novel, let alone a horror novel, I am Legend is the perfect one for you.
1589795474|3.0|The topic of personal finance is important, and finding resources such as this book to guide decision-making can be very helpful in that process.  This book did a fine job of motivating the problem and suggesting reasonable approaches to wealth accumulation.  (Hunt: earn non-taxable income, be frugal).<br /><br />The book is essentially a survey post-analysis: they collected data (primarily from millionaires), and they share that data and try to explain it.<br /><br />Statistically, I am not fond of their approach: they make it a point to say things like \\"most millionaires do not drive the current model year vehicle,\\" but their data suggests that over 46% drive cars within one model year, and 62% within 2: i.e. they mostly drive 'new' cars - and that doesn't even include the 19% who lease, which is in a footnote of the chart, and take those numbers to 56 and 69%.  They interpret cherry-picked numbers because they have already formulated their conclusion, and are able to find data that correlates with their notions.  And they do themselves a disservice by limiting their participants to millionaires - I imagine some very poor people have similar spending and saving habits to the subjects they present.  I do not disagree with their notions, only that they often use numbers to justify them that can be interpreted to mean the exact opposite of the points they are trying to make, and more numbers on non-millionaires would be useful to support their general hypotheses.<br /><br />Stylistically, I do not care for this book either. It reads very much like one of those \\"personal improvement\\" books (it is, after all) that all say the same thing: long-winded on made-up scenarios and hand-picked case studies, short on solid advice, but YOU CAN DO IT!  This is no book for an investor, this is no substitute for a half-hour session with a CPA, and I am uncertain that an intelligent person who has not already been motivated on this issue would become so by reading this book.<br /><br />However, for a person like me (late-20's, interested in personal finance and attempting to get on the right track), this certainly serves as motivation.  There's very little new information, but it reinforces many of my beliefs about frugality and other decision-making that will serve to bolster my assets.  So if you're someone who has enough interest in personal finance to have read this entire review, just buy the book - it just might provide enough motivation for you to focus your efforts.  Buy it used though :)
B00C6B7GTE|5.0|Classic Steel book. Great buy unless you already own the movie on Blu-ray since there are no extras that haven't already been releases on previous editions

B0089LOG02|5.0|My daughter loved it said it was a great story good characters<br />Made her cry and she is a picky reader
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|I enjoyed as much of it as I could read, but it became bery ponderous. I began by liking the main character, but by the middle I could care less about her and the saccharine world she was in. Enough already. The point had been made numerous times by the middle.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|This was the best superman by far. Great story line and graphics. Wish I would have watched this in the theaters.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Great little waste of time. I picked it up as the free app of the day, but it's worth paying for.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|I was shoveling snow at night in a peace and quiet environment when I first heard the album.  Right away I was impressed by the album.  Impressed in that it seemed every song was different and of a quality that's difficult to find on every song.  But I also thought it must've had a whole lot of studio time to get to this level and would be impossible to perform live.<br /><br />But then I punched Jack White into YouTube and there were 4 full concerts of them performing songs from Blunderbuss.  At a time when it seems that everyone is protecting their concerts Jack White changed things up and put quality produced concerts (one by Gary Oldman) for free.<br /><br />And each concert there is nothing that feels like any of the other concerts though performed in the period of time.  Even sings the same songs differently at different concerts.  He's able to pull this off by having 2 bands backing him up - a all female group called the Peacocks and a all male group called the Buzzards.  Plus he rarely even takes a break to catch his breath between songs.  He's amazing!<br /><br />If those that watch any of his concerts and don't pick up the songs I'd be very surprised.  I know I was \\"awakened\\" to a incredible talent and have bought just about every CD and/or song he's affiliated with through Amazon.  Grab the album - you won't be disappointed.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|phenomenal movie, I would watch it over and over and over.  I am dying for the second one to come out....you must watch this!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was sucked in right away. The characters are all people I wish I could know personally & the story kept me hanging on from beginning to end. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great work of fiction. I'm starting on the next installment right now! I don't know how I hadn't heard about this author before now, but I am so glad I finally caught on!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Not the best entry in the Superman franchise as a whole.  Confusing plot line.  Weak characters.  Only thing going for it was the special effects.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|To much wrong with this movie to type out right now.<br /><br />Basically didn't feel like Superman. Thousands die. Kent who? CGI overkill. Lane is that you?<br /><br />Stick to the Reeves version. Still the best movie.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Every human being needs to see this video.  I knew everything in the film already before I saw it, because I've been upset about the situation of captive orcas for 20 years, but even so I cried 3X.  Many people may avoid the film because they know it will be disturbing.  But that's just why you should see it.  What we have done here is unconscionable--as unconscionable as slavery, as the Third Reich, as child abuse--and the ONLY way the situation will ever be rectified is if we all accept responsibility for our parts in it.  If you have ever visited a marine mammal park, you are implicated.  But more than if you stand by now and do NOTHING, you are implicated just as surely.  We all have to take action.  Watch this video, then learn more about what you can do to help captive orcas.  Good places to start are [...] and [...] .  Donate what you can.  Offer to help.  Picket SeaWorld.  Do whatever it takes.

B005CAPS0K|5.0|GREAT movie!! I adore Patrick Wilson. Scared my socks off! I love these kinds of movies and this does not disappoint! Would definitely recommend it, though to be honest I was surprised about the PG-13 rating. It gave me nightmares as an adult, definitely would NOT want to see this as a teenager!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I great little book to really make you &#34;get&#34; that LOA really exists and you are connected to it... It's written in a quick, easy to read way. And do not get discouraged if your time frame for the experiment takes a bit longer... Go on to the next one if you need to...Until you get good at focusing in one direction rather than having a more scattered focus, it takes a bit longer... Sort of like your first trip to Costco, you might get distracted a few times on your way to the aisle that has what you came for...You will come away from the book with a better understanding of how powerful you really are.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Another great mind game . . . it makes me look at how to solve something differently! And not always in the way you would think!!!
B000000OF6|5.0|I love Queen's songs, but never owned one of their albums. But this collection has all of the great songs with which I am familiar from the radio and films.  Who can forget Bohemian Rhapsody (1st track) from Wayne's World, or Under Pressure (last track second CD) from Grosse Point Blank.  All of the greats are here and it is a blast to listen to, I love this collection.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|Good movie, well acted, with better than average continuity and direction.  The downside is some broad interpretations of the history of the era that likely would not stand up well under scrutiny.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was films with awesome power<br /><br />THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN WITH RAW POWER COLLINS IS A GENUS WRITER AGAIN, AWESOME
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was awesome. Reading the third now, super excited!!! Totally a read you won't  regret. Don't stop now continue the series.
B00F8OV4HQ|5.0|For 40 years Ry Cooder has been a major player in the music business - as a stellar side-man and an original voice/guitarist on his own right.  All these albums were great, and to my knowledge none have been released as remastered CD's.  Since this release is from Rhino, one might think they have indeed been remastered, but no mention of this in the description.  Plus, at this price, it seems doubtful.  Anyone know the story?  Wonderful music, made better if indeed remastered.    After listening to a number of these cuts on Spotify, I am convinced NONE of the songs match the versions on the original albums.  All seem to be a different take or mix or?  So, if you have all these singly, buying this set is not a true duplication, at least not to my ears.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is what years of growing and evolving came to in Korn.  Anyone who listens to this album is hearing the refined and enriched product of all the veteran members of this band, even the new drummer gets it.
B00005KHJR|5.0|The  numbered collectors  2 disc edition arrived in near  perfect condition, except for a mark on the wooden box, from the UK in 2 wks! I paid 15.98 total  including S&H for this limited edition. It's #02228 of 50.000.  I highly recommend the seller.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Simply a classic WWII story of the war in the Pacific from a soldier's point of view.  Well written, it's like you were in the field with Sledge.  It shows how ALL the men who fought in these conditions were heros not only those who were highly decorated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|:) Been waiting forever for this to come to my KINDLE Fire and I am so thrilled it is finally here :)
1490550623|5.0|Cult of Mirrors was written as a fiction book, but gang stalking or organized stalking is very real and is a growing epidemic.  Cult of Mirrors opens a closet door in our society and shines a light on a secret that the puppeteers would rather leave closed.  I live in Southeastern Wisconsin and have experienced gang stalking first hand and many of the stalking experiences described in this book are fairly accurate, including the colors of the cars, the bumper stickers that are displayed, the emotional gaslighting, assaults by noise (hotels & stores), and the type of people who participate in the community bullying.  The sole purpose of the gang stalking is to destroy a person's existence and leaving no trace that foul play was to blame.  It is the school bully on steroids and Ms. Prag does an excellent job of exposing this ever growing cult that I consider a crime against humanity.  Once you start reading Cult of Mirrors you will find it difficult to put it down.

B00EZQJX76|5.0|I'm a senior citizen and this was a favorite book of my childhood.  I re-read it recently on my Kindle.  It's a charming story, particularly for girls, but outdated for today's tastes.  It's still a good read, however.  The story has adversity and romance,and gives a good picture of attitudes & conditions of times gone by.  I know that it had a positive influence in building my &#34;philosophy of life&#34;.  And, today, I still have my &#34;Pollyanna&#34; moments.  I recommend it.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Okay, we'll get this out of the way immediately: I adore adore adore Lady Gaga. And perhaps the thing that I've admired most about her (and the thing that sets her apart from everyone else) is her great musicality. Her first three CD's were stupendously above par.<br /><br />Now we come to ARTPOP, which I had the highest expectations for. LG has had a lot of time off with her hip surgery, so I could only presume that she was devoting herself to whipping up her masterpiece. What a shocking, bizarre letdown! They say that if you put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter indefinitely, eventually they will type \\"Hamlet.\\" But it would only take a week for those chimps to create these \\"songs.\\" Gone are any verses, choruses, bridges...or melodies. They are mostly hideous patchworks of shallow, cast-off ideas, picked out of the trash and stuck-together. When some filler is needed, in EVERY SINGLE NUMBER she chants the title out repeatedly. The background instrumentals are an unrelenting din of loud noise. By the time the god-awful \\"Jewels 'n Drugs\\" rolls around, the project is DOA. I know some huge Gaga fans whose reaction to this are far worse than mine. I get the concept of ARTPOP, sort of, but it falls thud flat. It is bad art and no pop. Two or three songs are okay, but nothing comes even remotely close to \\"Just Dance,\\" \\"Poker Face,\\" \\"Bad Romance,\\" or \\"Edge of Glory,\\" just to name a few. In fact, if this were a first recording that preceded her enormous fame, ARTPOP would never have been released. I cannot imagine what was going through her mind as she listened to this mess. Was she somehow setting herself up for failure? If this is what giving up pot did for Gaga, for God's sake, give the girl a doobie.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of one because I do still love Lady Gaga. I hope this isn't the end, but it will take a very long recovery and a mind-blowing comeback to overcome this tragedy.

B00G32QIEG|3.0|Fun romp along the Men in Black line. Reynolds is good as always and Bridges uses the same voice character he has been using since True Grit.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Might be the worst film I've ever seen, and I'm 43 so that's saying something.  A nonsensical, violent and incoherent retelling of the Superman origin story. The editing is terrible - main characters die only to reappear two scenes later to dispense with some homespun bromides (spoiler alert).  The special effects look like they're from a late 90s era film.  Seriously, even Superman Returns in 2006 had more believable SFX.  Zero chemistry between the main actors.  Avoid avoid avoid!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is such a fun game I could play it all day!!!!!!!!!! I recommend everyone download this very very fun game immediately
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Could not get to the right page very fast (if at all) a paper copy is definitely better than this.

B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|Its a nice looking calculator but its accuracy fails the square root test.<br /><br /> To test this do square root of 2 times square root of 2. That should give you 2 if its an accurate calculator if its an inaccurate it will give you 1.99999. This  calculator gives the inaccurate result
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book gives great insight and practical steps you can take to be a better spouse. I definitely recommend it!
B00BATG18K|5.0|I don't understand why the average review for this book is 3 stars. I have seen romance novels get better reviews. Come on folks, think before you write inane reviews. This book is not a romance novel. It is about relationships among a discreet group of women, some of whom become trapped in a life they did not choose...that of a courtesan (in China, approximate years: 1897-1926) when women had very limited choices.<br /><br />Amy Tan is an author with \\"amazing\\" writing skills. She researched this book for years. She has personal knowledge about the Chinese culture (i.e. she's the daughter of Chinese immigrants) and has personal experience with women's relationships (between two continents). She weaves the motifs of the story so skillfully and craftfully, that we should all be in awe of her abilities.<br /><br />One motif I loved was about the painting, \\"The Valley of Amazement.\\" Each woman sees something different in the painting; each time the painting reappears in the story, something dramatic happens. I also loved the motif about the women deliberately choosing to recreate themselves, renaming themselves in the process. Many themes abound in this book, and Amy Tan skillfully weaves all the themes in a cohesive and elegant manner.<br /><br />Also, I loved how the character's grew--especially Violet. She grows from a spoiled, petulant child to a woman with such internal strength she is able to survive hardships and give her strength to those around her. She is constantly remaking herself. She learns to both accept love and to give it. I love this amazing story.<br /><br />For these reasons I rate it 4.5 stars--since I can't give half stars, I round up to 5.0 stars.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|A must-watch for Broadway enthusiasts.  Debra Messing is as quirky and captivating as ever, especially in her morally troubling romance with the sexy Broadway vet Will Chase (be ready to fall in love!). Megan Hilty has thrilling talent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and was so happy to see it a valuable on the kindle fire again. No complaints here.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a beautifully created wildlife series. The only thing that bugs us a little bit is that it jumps from continent to continent with barely a mention of where you are viewing. For instance, you might be watching mountain lions in the US Rockies, and then without much notice they jump to similar cats in the mountains of Asia, and then off to New Zealand or somewhere. It's all very pretty, but I wish there was a little globe graphic down in the corner of the screen that reminded us of where we are visiting. I get my mind set on this scenery being in Asia, and then forget that we have jumped halfway around the world in the blink of an eye. Kind of wish they would study one continent or region at a time instead of globetrotting so much. Otherwise, this series is gorgeous, informative, and fascinating for all ages!
B003L77GH4|5.0|grandaughter loved it
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For my \\"mid-sized\\" gear, this is the perfect backpack. It has several compartments and lots of pockets and storage.  Also, it is very well made.  I changed the Velcro configuration around so that the heaviest item, the camera, is at the bottom as a lower point of gravity makes for easier carrying.  I also waterproofed the backpack.  For the price, this is an excellent deal.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book after having seen the new movie, and at first it was hard to get into.  When you see a movie first, in my opinion, it sours the book.  Not in the case though.  I was pleasantly surprised and am very happy I read it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Luv this movie. Funny, musical and a little naughty.  All the characters are cast perfectly and are likeable in their own way.
B0089LOG02|3.0|The story careens between two characters that are unrelated, but then again so similar.  Characters believable, descriptions clear and visual.
B00EK0UBPU|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book but found the writing disjointed, repetitive and somewhat artificial. High expectation was rewarded with disappointment
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Season 3 was going awesome, and then it ends abruptly. Too bad the show was cancelled. I enjoyed the enterprise seasons more than any of the other star treks.
0451228375|5.0|Book condition was exactly what was described. I enjoy this series and this follows the first book. Good sized book for carrying around.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it finally came to the Kindle! I definitely have a love/hate relationship with it and I probably will need a 12-step program soon.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Excellent book. Worth every penny. True patriotism and American hero. A shining example on and off the battlefield. I recommend this book.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This was my first Nora Roberts book, and I thought it was excellent and it has hooked me onto other books by her. The romantic storyline was terrific as the two main characters were polar opposites and even disliked each other at first. There is a serial killer after the main character, which is always a great plot in anything. There is a lot of details about dog training and dog searching, which I found very interesting, but I suppose that if you don't like dogs, that could be annoying. I think the rest of the book and plot is good enough though that you can risk the dog talk!
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|This is a powerful story about how Romeo and Juliet could have been written. I love this movie. Watch it!
B001O54NL2|4.0|This is an oldie, but goodie.  You can't go wrong with old school music.  Love &#34;Sailing&#34;.on this cd and many more.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Very fun and interesting, there is no better way to watch Shakespeare than through the characters and imagination of Joss Whedon
B00425S1H8|5.0|I have bought some of the fleabay specials for less money than this plugable adapter cost, but always have to resort back to this one when the others flake out or I can't find drivers.  This has worked with Linux and windows without issue. It has the female screw ends so my console cables connect and secure to it. Really, it just does what it is supposed to.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|I don’t recommend anyone waste their valuable time watching this. There is nothing endearing about the story or script. The great cast is absolutely wasted. I could not even finish watching it.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Jim Carrey on top of his game! It is a very unique movie that is ultimately carried by Jim Carrey's great performance!
B008EKMB82|5.0|This book is a gem. It sucked me in as flotsam and set me adrift in a gyre. There are numerous themes and ideas strung together like pearls. Beautiful, heartfelt, youthful, coming of age character development of Naoko. Contemporary world events are woven into the fabric of the story from the 2011 Japanese earthquake, the Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown, 9/11, cyberspace. The yin and yang of contemporary Japan to old Japanese culture. The yin and yang of Japanese versus western culture. Maid cafés. Proust. Quantum physics. Now is then. Ruth's commitment to uncover the content in the zip lock bag and for Naoko's diary to land in the hands of someone who wanted to listen and know the outcomes. I loved the \\"voice\\" Naoko used in writing her diary. I simply loved Naoko's character. The story evoked a broad array of emotions in me and in the characters. I learned so much from this book. I thank the author for her brilliant mind and her gift of story telling.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I had to buy this to listen to Josh Groban's silky, smooth voice at the end of the story. I am a big fan of Josh.  Besides, this has a lot of good songs in it.  The story itself is very cute and well done for kids to watch. And I would like to give Tom Hanks<br />the highest rating for his talent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun, plus the constant changes is scenary is so fun. They go to Florida, Spain, Brazil and more. Never looses its thrill.
B003G4W49C|3.0|When you go to sleep, have a nightmare and it's one of those that seem so real. It wasn't real; just a game.  Was this an short version? There seemed holes in the story line. I hope the movie is a little more excitement and the sequel gives more about the early wars. It was ok.
0316055433|5.0|The book is a masterpiece and well worth the price.  Very glad I was able to get it so quickly.
B006S0696A|4.0|Truly a fascinating adventure that I understand was a very realistic perspective of the human body and its defend mechanisms. Wish there had been a little more of an ending, it left me wanting more.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|An enjoyable, easy to read book.  You won't be disappointed.  We read to escape, right?  This one will take you there!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Now I can capture my memories from the live production whenever I want. Brings tears to my eyes every time.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|It may not be for everyone but I loved the entire series. How much more creative can a series be and the acting if phenomenal.  And then there is Albuquerque - what an fantastic setting for this series.  Everything works perfectly. Love it!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|The producers did a good job turning this book into a movie.  It has been a while sense I read the book, so there are parts where I missed changes that were made due to time constraints.  The actors and settings were good, and is deffinatly a variation of the book where one can follow the plot even with out having just read the book.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|This series just kept getting better and better.  Well worth the price.  Great clarity!  Cannot wait for next volume in the series.
1449433251|5.0|I love the drawings and funny dialogue in this set of comics!  Having the complete set is wonderful, it allows for hours of wonderful reading and knowing I have all the comics and am not missing any.  I do wish the books were hard cover instead of paperback so they would last longer.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|If you have Blu Ray you need to update your library with this volume. I have DVD but once I saw the clarity in Volume one, I was hooked!
B00F0AYF9M|5.0|Every song on this CD is just plain awesome!Her voice and the musical arrangements are stellar!I look forward to more from them!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|What can I say?  If you love this series as I do, you need to get this set.  Countless hours of enjoyment await you either by going in order or picking out favorites.
B001AXOFS4|5.0|Adele just shines!Voice,lyrics and only a guitar needed to back her up!I have everything she's ever done and it never disappoints!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very useful and easy to set up. I mostly use my phone now to control streaming video. This is a no brainer !
B005H0IW6W|5.0|The smooth melodies of Michael's voice make his music a pleasure to listen to.  This was a gift for my husband and he loved it.  It also helped to ring beautiful christmas music throughout our home.
145210655X|3.0|The book came damaged.  The book had pages that were not separated and you could need read the entire book.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I stumbled onto this and I am hooked. Wonderful plot. Superb acting by Benedict Cumberbatch. The first episode is by far the best and 100 times better than most big screen movies of our time (in content and quality)
B000GOUMPI|5.0|I have always loved watching this movie.  Now that I bought it I can watch it anytime I want and I will
B000SEFNMS|4.0|A wee bit defensive, but well written and thoroughly researched.  You really feel like you know Chris by the end.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Great movie for adults. Reminds me of my childhood years when I had a teddy bear and would take it everywhere I went.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this app!! Not only addicting I can get it on my phone, kindle as well play on my computer!! There's no missing out on requests or lives!!
0439023521|4.0|This book is a must read for all, ranging from young teens to mature adults. No matter what genres interest you, The Hunger Games will suck you in regardless. With constant obstacles and challenges the protagonist character must overcome, there are few dull moments in the book. On top of the thrilling action of the games, the book provides romance, a social message, and an intriguing plot to entice the reader. After finally reading the book, it is no mystery why an award winning movie was created. I highly recommend the book but I must offer fair warning that you may end up staying up past your bedtime as it is difficult to put this book down.<br /><br />The Hunger Games will have you questioning the morals of our society while you're rooting against a futuristic representation of North America. As the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen is forced to overcome great economic adversity; the Capitol of the country lives a lavish lifestyle. Through Katniss' district and the Capitol, you will realize the faults of our own society but also be grateful for the political and economic fortune we have in the US today. It is easy to develop an attachment to Katniss as she grows throughout the book. She represents hope for humanity in a world gone astray and at the same time is threat the dystopian society of Panem which makes her all the better. Katniss' fight for survival is sure to entertain the readers; whether or not they are looking for violent action or innocence of humanity amidst the cruelty of society.
B0007TKNII|4.0|my youngest son, he loves the music and he just learned to play the songs on the piano, he is going to be so surprised and I am so happy I found it on amazon
141690977X|5.0|I bought this book just for fun cause of Sophie from 2 broke girls hahaha. It's a good book if you don't know a lot about guys, it's one of those books you would read when your bored and don't have nothing to do. I however have a past as a guy now I'm a full female. So I didn't need the  book but like I said 2 BROKE GIRLS!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|As long as you're not easily frustrated you will enjoy this game. Although there are opportunities to purchase in-game hints, you can just as easily lookup hints on the internet and youtube if you get stuck. I will continue to enjoy this game for quite a while, I think.
B00FVVR2ZO|1.0|I play this game on Facebook and was so looking forward to it coming to Kindle only to be extremely disappointed that it's not compatible with my HD and I am unable to take advantage of the offer of free diamonds.
6305428042|5.0|My favorite movie around Halloween time, couldn't find on the T.V. schedule, so I bought it. A great movie to watch with the family.
B00C7NKPPS|3.0|have not had a chance to finish listening to it  .I like it so far will try to finish soon
1449410243|5.0|This arrive a MONTH, yes a whole month before the expected arrival time. The book is perfect for any sort of gift and taking a quick flick through it, the quality of the book is right up there!<br /><br />Thanks a lot!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love every song on this album  it is an amazing piece of work listen to it every day at least once or twice,
1250038820|5.0|I am an aspiring NYU Film/Photograpjy student, and this book made me more excited than ever to live in the Big Apple. Stanton's ability to take captivating photographs with personal, resonant interviews creates an overall lasting impact in each and every one of his photos. This is a must-have.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I had high hopes for Camille, the main character. During her stay in her hometown, she develops this bizarre curiousity and addiction to her sick and twisted family. I enjoyed the storyline and the plot but the characters are just strange and irritated me the further I read along. Still a decent read but I'm glad it was not my first of Flynn's.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Someone had the &#34;bright&#34; idea of making a movie that combined Transformers and Godzilla.  What a waste of time.  No acting, no character development, no rationale.  If you have a brain, do not watch this movie.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I listened to this book on audio, and was the first book I had read by Flynn. I really enjoyed her style of writing and the development of all the characters, how she writes from each one's view point and really grasps their individual nature. This one is still my favorite, because the storyline is so seamless and interesting, the past and present are narrated by each individual family member and the ending was so unpredictable.
B00EO10M54|5.0|Best album I have ever purchased! I can't stop listening! Miley Cyrus continues to impress me with her music.. such a great variety on this album.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn's latest has you guessing from the very first page. The narration of her characters keeps switching from Amy to Nick, both in the past and present, along with keeping you from deciding who was the protagonist and the antagonist. Although the plot gets very thick but is extremely well planned out by the author, because you can't help placing yourself in each of the characters' shoes trying to uncover the one base that was missed and bringing an end to the whole mess. The ending was disappointing, because of all the build up of anger and injustice... but appeases the character's personalities perfectly... these two are both locked into this sick and twisted marriage without any prospect of ever changing.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I love the whole set piece as a collection, art and total geek stuff! this product is top solid! and for those who haven't viewed the walking dead.. GET GOING!
0486408434|4.0|The illustrations are good.  I'm 61 and the techniques require practice.  I saw a DVD series on Amazon that I may purchase in the future.  This is a book for beginners.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read Divergent and I liked it a lot. Insurgent was also pretty good, not quite as good, but it was still an enjoyable read which had a coherent story. Allegiant? It was possibly the worst final installment to a trilogy I have ever experienced.  It was poorly written from both Tris and Tobias' standpoint. That was a lousy gimmick, first of all, and, second, it failed miserably. None of the story made sense. I also don't think Tobias wouldn't have cared at ALL about being genetically deficient. He also turned into a whiney baby, which was totally out of character. You took one of the main protagonists in the book and turned him into a baby and a wimp, when he was anything but that. Plus, his resolution with his Mom was a joke. Also not coherent.<br /><br />Finally, SPOILER ALERT, when the big thing happens at the end. FINAL CHANCE SPOILER ALERT. When Tris dies. I responded in the worst way possible. With apathy. I didn't care. I just wanted the story to end and if Tris dying was the route to get there, I was ok with that. There is nothing more unfortunate than to sit with characters for three books and have one of them die and not even care. I contrast that to a character dying in one of Stephen King's multi book stories, which wrecked me and still does to this day.<br /><br />Don't read this book. Even if you're a completionist, don't read this book. It is long, boring, and a total waste of time.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Cute, simple, fun, especially toward the end. Joss and friends just having fun. Just all around good time on a low budget.
B0040HERTY|2.0|Dumb movie but still fun.  Who couldn't like Bruce Willis in this series.  I don't think he jumped the shark but it's the last one for sure.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Zombies... I love em. and the plot is great. and amazon carrying the walking dead for such a good price is great
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|Colorful tale of the gold-rush times in New Zealand, with a mystery at the heart of the story. Interesting characters who reflect different responses to sudden wealth and clever trickery. The opium trade is forthrightly discussed and its human costs revealed with sympathy. Beautifully written.
B002APU580|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, and in my opinion is the #1 version of Pride & Prejudice.  Love being able to watch it anywhere on my laptop!
B0041KBWM0|4.0|This is the best Emma adaptation, I would had given five stars, but I was disappointed that many scenes were cut from the BBC original.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great book with practical, attainable exercise to put to work the law of attraction and manifesting.  Great complement for readers who are already familiar with the subject matter, and also a great kick start for those who are new to this type of work.  Easy to read, easy to follow.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product. Ease of use. If you're looking for easy setup, no hassle, this is the product for you, I bought product because I wanted to watch Neflix  ON MY  TV without transporting my WII AND XBOX from room to room in my home. This prouduct went beyond my expectations.  I love it !!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a fantastic novel. The historical base is solid, and forces you to go back to your reference books constantly and go over your facts.<br /><br />The plot is deep and complex, but flows well. The characters are interesting and endearing and integrate well into the story. All in all a fantastic book
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As soon as I knew this book was the sequel to The Shining I had to read it. All I can say is the book is perfection. Rich characters like only King can create, non-stop engaging writing that makes it painful to put down, thinking about the book when not reading... This book does not disappoint. I'm only sorry I've finished it!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|The best use of 3D technology yet. In classic Herzog fashion, this documentary teaches while introducing unusual real-life personalities while exploring a fascinating museum of our human pre-history that most of us will never see in person. The cave paintings make full use of the shapes and textures of the uneven cave surfaces, making 3D visualization imperative to gain a full sense of the magnificence of there work.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Love this movie so much! It came it great shape and like I said Love this movie so freaking much!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Ender has conflict and struggles but still comes across to perfect in his emotions.  His relationship with Nohvina is lacking true emotions as well.  Story is fascinating with a lot of cultural anthropology.
B0077JAXDQ|3.0|Please let the people know that the instructions are all in japanese. Apart from that the order was perfectly fine
1476734941|5.0|Interesting and informative  --  the ONLY diet I have ever been able to cope with, and this book tells me why that is true.  I really liked it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's fun at first take care of your horse and other things but after it gets kinda old not to many activities you can see your friends thats all you really do but it is okay I don't play it any more
0399157573|5.0|Have not read it yet  --  I only got it yesterday, but I have loved every one of Cornwell's books and do not expect this to be an exception.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I would love to play solitaire in bed, but this app completely ignores the fact that I've locked my screen rotation. It's always 90&deg; off from where I want it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Ordered this for my parents they loved it on PBS - this edition even better they said . love how amazon has full detail of the edition so you know what you are ordering ! Plus notified when edition 3 was available.
B008JFUO72|2.0|My reasons for not liking Iron Man 3 are probably the opposite of everyone else's. For me, the &#34;best&#34; moments in the film are the small personal ones. The genesis of AIM in Switzerland. Happy Hogan fretting about his new head of security position. Pepper Potts and her relationship with Tony. Tony Stark and the young boy in Tennessee.SPOILER: The reveal about the &#34;actor&#34;, who's portraying the Mandarin. (Ben Kingsley's a scene stealer) The action scenes are interminably long, and so over-the-top in non-stop destruction and violence , that one's reminded of the finale in MAN OF STEEL. If I wanted to watch a video game, I'd get a Nintendo. I'll stick with the original Iron Man, and write this one and #2 completely off. I'd definitely recommend a rental before purchasing, because you may regret it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a really good game everyone should have this game it is a really good game. Even my mom and dad like it.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|This is a movie about character, first, and superhero action, second. They got it right. Actually, this does what a comic book movie adaption should do - improve upon the original source. If you don't care about the characters-villains included-then what's the point of filming it? The script and acting in this film are superb. Marvel &#34;dad&#34; , Stan Lee, was interviewed and pointed out that Daredevil was probably his least favorite Marvel movie. Personally, I think he was just &#34;Going along with the crowd&#34; and trashing the movie. Shame on you Stan. If you want the nonstop action &#34;video game&#34; substance of say, Iron Man 3 , or The Avengers, then this movie probably won't be for you. Time will tell.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|Shipping was perfect as always- However I kind of wish I would have waited. I definitely enjoyed part 1 more than part 2. But if course I had to get the set as support for an amazing artist!
1594204217|5.0|Cooked is like the greatest declaration of love for cooking I have ever experienced. It is like a Born to Run, but for food, it just makes you want to you bake, ferment, and enjoy food. And yes - it is an eye opener in the evils of modern food production which is needed. What I love most about it is that Pollan writes how he learns to cook - we get to participate on his journey. This makes it so much more enjoyable as you don't get the &#34;expert and teacher talking down to you&#34; but a welcoming text.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Bought the first one, and like it a lot, so I bought this one, just as good. I hope they keep making the Star Trek series with these actors.
0446310786|5.0|I read this novel for the first time in the 8th grade. I have read it several more times in the 30 years since then. Somehow each time I read it, I convince myself that the outcome of the trial will be different! Atticus provides such compelling evidence of Tom's innocence. There are several scenes that are especially touching, but at the heart of the novel is the struggle of the main characters to be honorable in the face of hatred. The novel holds timeless appeal.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Bought the other 2 , and I wanted this one. One of the best. Get all three they are good movies.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I really enjoyed the console versions so the kids and I decided to get this. It works well on a tablet and has just enough challenge to make it fun to play. I think it's defiantly worth the price and they did a nice job with this app. If you enjoy Rayman you should get this app.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It keeps saying that it is currently unavailable and its been saying it forever I love the app cause I've had it before though please help thanks
B009XI7RF6|4.0|Interesting game and can be fun. I'm not up to speed on what colors mix to create other colors so I probably have a harder time than some other users. Overall a nice app.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Useful for those who dont have a smart tv or game console which allows you to use youtube or netflix via tv. Casting chromes tabs into tv didnt work so well that I wanted: Video stream is poor quality even if original video is HD. Altough its easy to install and use. I allready sold it forward...
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I've only played with a couple of hours but I can see why some people would love it. It's simple in presentation and concept but challenging to play. Overall worth a purchase if you like puzzle games.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Ohh my Gods this was like the best book I have read in my life! worth the money hilarious! Best book that exists!<br />But...........I'm not sure if boys would like them as mouth as I did if your an immature boy you would probably give this book a 3 but if your not somewhere between 4-5
B00867HDTA|4.0|I enjoyed my time with this app, but it's fairly simple and can get a little old after a while. You kick the ball into the goal using your finger then swiping the screen to change the direction of the ball. They add obstacles and moving targets to hit to give it variety but eventually it suffers from being the same thing.<br />I got it as a free app, but think it's worth a couple bucks.
B006KC4NK0|5.0|this is an awesome set, fits nicely in my Lego DC universe collection, now to just get a few more
0345803507|5.0|Great book...you don't want to put it down! Once you start the Trilogy you can't wait to get to the next book!
0345308239|5.0|Excellent, Nothing at all to say agains this book, a real lesson in how people insist on their mistakes, always to appalling results.
0439023491|5.0|great ready. Read it in 2 days. My favorite of the 3 part series. action packed and full of surprises. Definitely recommend. Can;t wait for the movie.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|All the other xmen movies don't even come close to how good first class is. This is hands down the movie that not only sets the bar for X-men movies but for comic movies!!! The story, characters, SFX, and just about anything else you can list helps make this a must watch for any comic book movie fan. This is to our generation what Star wars Episode IV was way back when. Do yourself and everyone else a favor and at the very least watch it.
B004LR5K0I|4.0|music good did not like the packaging. the discs keep falling out. good sound and a nice addition to collection.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|My kids haven't stopped singing this song since we first heard it in late 2012.  When we saw there was a game, we just laughed.  It is exactly what you'd expect and involves tasks that you sing about &#34;get your toast out with a fork&#34;, &#34;don't press the red button&#34;.  I don't think it's something you'd play for hours but as a 5 minute distraction, it's wonderful.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|She really likes this movie, so when the soundtrack popped up on Amazon, I thought it would be a great gift.  She really likes it and has certainly listened to it a lot.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Come on, now.  This is how it ends?<br /><br />I kind of forced myself to read &#34;Insurent&#34; (second book in the series) after not really feeling engaged by the first.  I was glad I did because it took the story to a new place and I thought that it was developing in an interesting way.  Tris and Four were never Rhett and Scarlett or anything like that but I did have a curiosity to see how their story unfolded.<br /><br />Without revealing spoilers, I just want to say I'm so disappointed.  I kind of wish I'd never read the entire series.  It seems now like a pointless endeavor.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Works much better than the Silk browser on my kindle....Amazon really needs to address the horrible functionality of the Silk browser.
B00BAXFDLM|3.0|Much of the novel is a bit confusing. It is hard to work pout who is what (this is SF after all).<br />Only at the end does the story begin to make sense and yet the story doesn't really end.
0393343405|5.0|Opened my mind to a new way of thinking about history, philosophy, and religion.  Extremely well-researched and well-written.  It's not an easy read, but it's compelling enough to keep the reader's attention.
0316074314|5.0|A tour de force. A richly textured book with a large cast of wonderful characters.<br />There is an astrological scheme involved but I did not find that I needed to<br />know how that worked to love the novel.
B005O7Q6FM|4.0|If you've enjoyed the last 3 seasons then season 4 will not disappoint! This show just keeps getting better and better.
0316055433|4.0|The book has received a lot of hype and although it is good it doesn't<br />quite live up to these expectations. I found it overlong. Many of the characters are not particulalry convincing.
B00ABXA1HI|3.0|I was able to download, sync and remotely access my computer.  I gave it three stars because it did as advertised but so slow as to be useless for me.  My son does gaming so I have a super high speed internet connection so that can't be the problem.  It is possible that it is my computer and not the program,  My laptop is a dinosaur.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Excellent suspensful read!  I love a good sexy murder mystery! I want to get more books like this, love the happy ending.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I waited a while to rate as I am still learning how to use this program.  Let me start by saying I am far from a techie.  I have 5 computers and a couple of them are dinosaurs and none of them have the same OS.  I have Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 7 Starter on a mini-HP, Ubuntu and a Kindle Fire, oh and a Droid phone.  In other words, I am a hot mess. I have used Microsoft Onenote for several years, I love it and I really didn't want to learn something new.  I was frustrated because of sync issues with my trusty onenote and also, I couldn't get Onenote on all my computers so I started tinkering with Evernote.  WOW.  Loved it almost from the start but still missed onenote because of the familiarity I had with it.  Now you can get onenote from the cloud and I am torn about what I am going to use going forward.  Still I give Evernote 5 stars because it is a super cool tool for organizing all your stuff.  I read that some folks have privacy issues with Evernote.  I guess I just feel that everybody is data mining and there is no way to avoid it unless you stay off the internet.  My 2 cents.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|Kind of a silly premise, I put it down for a better book.  Not terrible, but not what I expected.
B00129I5SM|5.0|Resident Evil and all it's parts has been on television recently but this one and the one before it are two of the most favorite ones in the series of movies and having this will free up room in my DVR for both sons and now they can watch it wherever and whenever they want to
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|I am not sure where people get the idea that the sound is terribly unbalanced. First, make sure you are choosing the correct mix (Stereo or surround) for your system. The video quality is simply top notch and the audio, provided you have a decent system to enjoy its awesomeness, it is crazy good. I can even hear John Myung and that's usually a non existent quality in many previous DT releases. Add a Buttkicker to your couch and be ready to get pounded by Mike Mangini! Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. Definitely a must have for DT fans!
B002NXSRW0|5.0|My son's love this movie and the other G.I. Joe movies and this is the favorite one. To add this to our collection for such a great price means I don't have to hope that redbox machines carry this type of movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This was my first experience watching a show/series on my laptop. Great way to watch. It's easy and many varieties to chose from
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game every day!! Once you start you can't stop until you run out of lives. The different levels keep your interest. It is addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Where is Candy Crush for Kindle?????????????  I get it on my phone, and on my computer, but can't get it on my Kindle?  What's the problem????  Are there any plans to get it on Kindle?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of John Grisham best book if not the best.  I really enjoyed reading this book and couldn't put it down.
B0026772N8|5.0|I highly recommend  it!  Took a while to finish but we'll worth the time. I recommend getting the professional narration.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book is a classic, I didn't read it in high school and I regret not reading it.  This book is a real page turner and I couldn't put it down.  I am now trying to catch up on the classics.
B005544TRQ|4.0|smart, witty and funny.finally a show with sophisticated humor and not just going for the obvious laugh, definitely worth watching.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators is not the best book by John Grisham but I enjoyed reading the book.  In fact, I like all of his books.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|The photographer bypasses the ubiquitous New York landmarks and focuses instead on what constitutes the heart of the city, and again he leaves behind the beautiful people and their wealth to take those sweet shots of happy, regular citizens in our streets.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Such a good album. They always do great with their music. I would reccomend this to anyone who is a fan.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Advertising is misleading.  States you can cast anything from Iphone or Ipad and in reality can only stream from two apps.  YouTube and Netflix. Pretty useless until extension for video streaming is added for iOS
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Good app, nice design comes in handy. I would definently recommend this app to anyone who wants yo save their writings.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|This book had all the history, story, intrigue and complexity that one could want! Once I got into the story, I couldn't put down the book. Definitely a blood and guts story, so it is not for the faint-hearted. But this book looks at a murder from the perspective of the father, from the local authorities, from the killers, from the killed and places this all in a historical perspective. I loved it!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Always a no fail with Rovio. Every angry bird app I 've gotten is awesome. This one I really like. By far my favorite.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|My son loved this screwdriver. Unfortunately the little button that connects the circuit kept malfunctioning. To fix it, we have to take it apart and put the button back into place. Other than that, it is a fun gadget.
B004GYY714|2.0|I downloaded this app thinking I could listen to Dave and Chuck the freak, but every time I tried it would say error and force it to close. Really disappointing.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Although it is a lot smaller than I expected, the figure is absolutely amazing! It has excellent multi-facial expressions, accessories, a stand, and even comes with Luna. I highly recommend buying this while it's still cheap and available; something like this is sure to become a rare item very soon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so glad when Amazon finally got this app. A lot of fun to play,  but highly addictive game.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Very entertaining. Surprisingly reminiscent of my youth.  I would love to see what Guillermo could do with a live action StarBlazers.
B004TTZHBK|3.0|This app didn't have very meny of his recipies as I thought it would. The layout is not really all that great either.
B003FCMAS0|5.0|Packed full of symbolism and mystique.  If you are just in for entertainment, this movie may confuse you, but otherwise it's a colorful and inventive portrayal of the multi-dimensionality of consciousness.  A creative, amusing story with depth.
B006M7JCC2|1.0|Extremely repetitive. What she had to say could be said in 10 pages - and she would still be repetitive. Also, although she claims that SHE cured her cancer by becoming her true self,  she underwent aggressive medical treatment. Her belief that all people are wonderful and worthy of love and acceptance is admirable and something to strive for, BUT their actions - which are the result of them becoming THEIR true selves (e.g., the terrorists she writes about) - can be horrible and make them unworthy of any love in my opinion.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|What a fantastic story.  Incredible that it's true.....A sad, and also heartening tale. You definitely wont be disappointed by this one!
B000T412OU|5.0|One of Harrison Ford's best movies. Just when you think it is over something else happens to prolong the excitement.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Love Bruce Willis. Love any movie he's in. I now own all the Die Hard movies. For action you can't go wrong.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Bought this book when it first came out, so was able to respond to it hype free. Feeling fairly lucky about that now. Instant fan! GRRM has an incredible talent for creating instantly intriguing and memorable characters on a breathtaking scale of numbers within this rich and complicated story. Completely gripping throughout.
B006WMILQU|5.0|This was a fun Jane Austin movie to watch on a cold fall evening while all snuggled in. Good casting and story line.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I haven't been this excited to read a book or read through one as quickly as I did these first 2 books in the series.  It sounds cliche but I just couldn't wait to see what happens next.
B002MG2ATY|4.0|Excellent documentary-style presentation of the inconsistencies surrounding the JFK assassination,  Casts significant doubt on the 'lone gunman conclusion', calmly and clearly presenting a credible theory of conspiracy.  The facts of the case are startling and leave the still-open question of why was all the information not more thoroughly evaluated before racing to the 'lone gunman' story as official.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What a great movie. Music is great. Singing is great. Dancing is great. Watch it often just for the music.  Richard Gere is fantastic and his performance in the court room is outstanding.  I normally don't enjoy Broadway plays converted to Movies but this absolutely is one of the best movies that I have watched.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Bought this for our 5yr old who LOVES it. He even went around the neighborhood this Halloween as Om Nom.<br /><br />Now my wife and I are addicted to this game. It lowers your productivity, you won't pay your bills on time, might vote for the wrong person in an election, but BUY THIS GAME!!!<br /><br />You won't regret it - it's cheap, it's fun, and it's something to play on the lawn while everything you own is being repossessed by large men with large slowly filling trucks, because you didn't pay your bills.<br /><br />Really - buy the game! Every chance we get to hold our Kindle Fire for ourselves, we play this game and can't stop!<br /><br />[sent by my iPrisonPhone through the wireless connection feed in Cell Block 12]
B00AFEQA5K|5.0|Loved it!!!!!!This is the best movie I have seen in years. The story line is great, and the cast makes it even better. Once I watched the trailer, I knew I had to have this movie. Dont know why its so hard to find. Amazon was the only place I was able to find it. But I'm so glad I finally have it in my movie collection!
B005SAP45I|4.0|Almost as good as the first! It's very 'Mater focused, so if you're not annoyed by him/Larry the Cable Guy, you're going to enjoy the film. Graphics are excellent, writing is excellent. Lost one star for two reasons, 1) Too much Mater. 2) Editing seemed choppy, as in the flow of the moving wasn't fluid, like a few scenes were deleted when they shouldn't have been. My 4 year old loved it so it will be added to our Disney library.
B000069KGM|5.0|I owned the Chicago 17 cassette tape as a kid in junior high but as my interests in classic rock grew, my interest in Chicago lessened, especially after Peter Cetera left the band (Dear Karate Kid II, thanks for wrecking Chicago).<br /><br />I feel like I've been ripped off because aside from some of the classic Chicago that received air play (25 or 6 to 4, Saturday in the Park, etc.) when I was growing up, I didn't know much about the band's roots.<br /><br />After introducing myself to the early Chicago records, I feel as though I've heard the gospel for the first time, wondering how I could have missed out on so many years of rock and roll with horns enjoyment.<br /><br />I'm leaving the same reviews for CTA and Chicago (II) because for me these 2 recordings go hand and hand and the two recordings transition from one to the other nicely.<br /><br />The standouts for me on CTA are \\"Listen\\" and \\"South California Purples\\" with \\"I'm a Man\\" and \\"Beginnings\\" following closely behind.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|There are some very fun experiments in here.  I read a chapter when I am somewhere boring and then work on the manifestation projects.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|I must have paid for it or I would not be asked to review it. Since the kindle died 6 months after I got it, I just wasted time & money on kindle books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I always have the Bible with me with this app.  It is easy to use. Very convenient since it is on my phone.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a cool little game.  I play it every once in a while but not really addictive.  If you already like mahjong you'll like this game.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|I must have paid for it or I would not be asked to review it. Since the kindle died 6 months after I got it, I just wasted time & money on kindle books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is positively addicting! It starts out with easy puzzles and advances to some very challenging puzzles. The sound effects are especially gratifying when two special candies are swapped and things explode. Chocolate squares are the bad guys. Almost made me dislike chocolate, an essential food group.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|VAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I loved this series for so very many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is for its ending.  It was not by any means an easy ending. I just finished the book about 30 minutes ago and I cried thru the last several chapters so it was slow going thru teary eyes and I have a headache now, but I think this ending was important.  This is a TRUE ending.  It teaches an important lesson, how to keep going, how to honor someone's memory, when you're certain there's no way you can keep going and it doesn't make sense that the world keeps going.  It doesn't save everyone for the sake of a happy ending but the ending is still hopeful.  I also love what these books teach about having a relationship, that its constant work on the part of both people involved.  I love what it teaches about bravery and selflessness and all the other attributes and human nature.  I love its critique of society and the hope it has for it.  I'm by no means saying it was a perfect book.  The sudden switch in narrator confused me a few times because the voices were not distinct enough and I was not expecting it from the first two books, however, getting to the ending, I'm surprised the choice didn't give away the end, it makes so much sense why it was done looking back.  Anyway, for me, this was a wonderful book, with messages I needed to hear again and perhaps that some readers, particularly YA, need to hear at all. Sometimes books are meant to help you escape, and sometimes they're meant to help you cope with life.  I think the backlash was people expecting an escape and getting slapped with life.  All I can really tell you is, it broke my heart, and I loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|it has a tendency to shudder, the screen won't be playing smoothly but will has pauses, and jumps.<br />The idea is brilliant so I'm hoping its just my internet
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Music is so subjective, but I've liked Muse for a number of years but just hadn't bought many discs until seeing them live in the city we live in.  (WOW - they are AMAZING live!)  Bought a couple of their albums after the concert because of how much I'd enjoyed some of the music I didn't already know, and of course the songs I did know.  If you like Muse's style, you'll like this album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves thus game she is a horse lover at heart and this game let's her reenact very accurate details of horse care. I'm pleased with this download.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Very juvenile. Reminds me of the Twilight series. Don't need a brain to read it. might be good for something easy to read during vacation.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  As a Grisham fan, I was surprised to find I had not read it long ago.  It's a bit quirky in places and that makes it just that much more enjoyable.  It's fun to see the &#34;original&#34; Grisham.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Got hooked watching season 1 on Netflix.  Bought season 2 here, couldn't be more pleased.<br />If you like horror stories, it doesn't get better then American Horror Story. A must see!
B00FX8EY60|5.0|katy has done it again! I think we will be hearing a lot of the songs on this album at the top of the charts agian.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!! I'm not even a child and I'm addicted to this game and a big fan of despicable me!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author has so vividly written this book that you cannot put it down. Suspense, with each turn of the page. Keeping the reader constantly engaged.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Very cool movie I am a big fan of 3D and this is a very good movie to see in that format,
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Enjoyed the ride, however, became a little unbelievable towards the end . Though the writing is good, the story line becomes a little strang at times.
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|Good product
B0058UXHHK|5.0|At first I was skeptical because I'm not the type to judge before I read and it looked more like a romance book but boy was I wrong..it's amazing and even though I have a hard time finding gift cards for kindles I will be getting the other two books<br />I was impressed!(:
B00C74HKF0|5.0|Beautiful Doll.  It is a present to a doll collector.  The doll is a very good likeness to Audrey Hepburn's princess in the movie.  Worth the money.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I love he game but when it says checking for updates it stays there &agrave;nd never hose to the game.

B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|Best object game ever!!!!if that's ur favorite,download this,nothing better.harder than it looks.lots of quests,and u get actual money,not like most games
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It sucks.  Like every other Bingo game I have downloaded, you ultimately have to spend money to continue playing.  I am not a gambler, I don't gamble at casinos and I don't want to be forced to do it with a downloadable game.  If you don't want to spend money on &#34;free games&#34; do not download this or any other Bingo game.
1400052181|5.0|great detailed story, good reading, compelling, yet painful . How could someones cancer cells be used and duplicated for research without her consent. Great story leading to what we now know know as mandatory protocols for research. Great book for ALL beginning researchers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So addictive.  Makes you think but not overthink.  Would recommend it to anyone who has time on their hands or wants something to play quickly.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I enjoyed it. A good page turner. Small town shown at its worst. Great characters and vey believable. Rowling at her best
B005HSL626|4.0|The game is easy to play and understand. You can play anywhere and it is relaxing and holds your interest.
B00BE909NO|4.0|I found it a little difficult to follow to start with but once I got into it I really enjoyed it. Fortunately it did not go into too much detail of the terrible things that happened during the civil war
B000006045|5.0|This was a gift to my girlfriend, she simply loves it, can't be more satisfied! Massive Attack is really creative and innovative. good for Dub style fans!!!
0440245915|5.0|Book came in good condition and fast. Quick read then saw the play.  Book was much better and I understand why  the broadway ratings tanked.
B00981V68W|4.0|Super fast-shipping, worth expensive shipping cost. by the CD itself it's really good if you're a Patricia Kaas fan but not so good for Piaf fans.
0670026557|3.0|As most readers do, I checked this book from the local library.<br /><br />Having been through all kinds of books from kindergarten, this is the first time I encounter the funny, weird, and poor quality control from book publisher (this book was published by the Penguin Group).<br /><br />After reading the Chapter 3 \\"The Ripple Effect\\" up until page 82, I continued onto the adjacent page. Suddenly the fonts change into different type, the texts are about very different topics. At the top of the page, it is page 83 (as it should be) but the heading is now \\"THE POWER AND THE STORY\\". Continued for few more pages, now I realized it is a completely mix-up with pages from another book but in the same order of page numbers. Pages from that different book (DOES JESUS REALLY LOVE ME?) continue until page 114, then from page 115 change to the remaining texts of this book \\"Give and Take\\".<br /><br />So be careful, check inside the book before buying or reading.<br /><br />(My overall impression even though missing some part of it, interesting book, but not quite convincing yet.)
B00022TPSO|3.0|Nice to know the first works on Black Sabbath legacy. here remains the blues roots, but also the heavy sounds to mark Black Sabbth style. for me it really worthy for two songs: Behind The Wall Of Sleep and NIB. this is why rate it with 3 stars. just for really fans of Black Sabbath but to begin I recommend Paranoid album.
8866131350|3.0|Too small to work with effectively.  Ok for an occasional note but not a good tool for daily business needs.
B000FBHC7S|5.0|Heavy, dark and slow pace. a masterpiece of doom and stoner rock, here you have crunchy and heavy, very heavy guitar riffs, drones and heavy ambient effects with a matching slow pace drums. a scenario of terror, witchcult, dead, desolation, drugs consmption and oscure world. singer for me isn't good but useful to manifest lyrics. what are you waiting for? buy now!!! for fans of doom and black sabbath. I think tjis is the best Electric Wizard album.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The female characters are particularly powerful and interesting, although the male characters are not patsies either.  It's a good balance as opposed to the usual primary male hero, female helpers or foils.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lots of twist , kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I like that it was modern day story.
B00CATSONE|1.0|No substance, just trying to sell other book, it is simply a marketing tool, do not waste your time reading this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is so col, especial for the money. yes, there are similar solutions but nothing this versatile, mobile and inexpensive. Love it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book. Keeps your attention throughout. Would highly recommend it to everyone. John Grisham proves again why he is such a great author.
B00FQPHA0M|4.0|Wow . . . I am not a Superman fan, but this movie interested me.  I am GLAD I tried it.<br /><br />The action is intense and of the kind that makes you want to re-watch scenes over and over.  Great fights.  Great explosions.  Science fiction aspects that are truly different.  From the ships to the creatures to the architecture to the suits--all very cool.  The effects are grand and incredible.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Cavill becomes Superman.  I am genuinely impressed.  There is no other Superman now.  He is the best.  Never expected that.  Most of all--because I have always hated Lois Lane--I actually liked Lois Lane's character for the first time ever! Amy Adams (and the writing) makes her likable, interesting, and admirable.  Zod and his right hand woman Faora are excellent villains fighting for a cause we can relate to.  They are unpredictable, believable, and never melodramatic.  The Kents are brought to life like never before.  They are not props or background pieces.  They are legitimate inspirations--superheroes in their own way.<br /><br />Only the story and characterization lack--no fault of the writers, though.  The movie just is not long enough to address all of the questions, quirks, and revelations that would make this story perfect.  The film can only touch upon what makes each character tick, what made Krypton and its people unique, and the science behind Superman.  So that is a weakness.  Also, who the heck was that giant and why wasn't he characterized!?!  Wow.<br /><br />They do not explain how and why Superman gets weak near the \\"atmospheric conditions\\" of Krypton.  That seems like a pretty stupid thing to neglect.  They would have been better off using the standard Kryptonite and applying plausible scientific explanations.<br /><br />The big surprise?  Jor-El is an incredible hero.  His scenes are probably the among the very best in the film.  Crowe is incredible.  The action is incredible.  His downloaded consciousness is fun and entertaining and very helpful.  Basically, Jor-El goes from being a hero like Batman to a heroic mentor figure who is a combination of Tony Stark's Jarvis and Obi-Wan Kenobi!  Just one of the best treatments of Superman's father ever.<br /><br />Worth buying.  No question.taining and very helpful.  Basically, Jor-El goes from being a hero like Batman to a heroic mentor figure who is a combination of Tony Stark's Jarvis and Obi-Wan Kenobi!  Just one of the best treatments of Superman's father ever.<br /><br />Worth buying.  No question.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I've used mine on my Virgin Mobile Android and a Nexus 7 tablet.  The tip is very firm and it has stood up to a year of steady use.  I like the weight - it is very well balanced. I have severe arthritis and have problems gripping normal-sized pens or pencils.  Most styli are smaller in diameter than a pen - and are impossible for me to use accurately!  Despite the large diameter, the Cosmonaut handles well... I use it to poke buttons, screen keyboards, and to write notes in programs like EverNote. I like the \\"non squashy\\" tip as well. It is nice to be able to write without the tip squashing backwards and following my pen strokes like I have happen with a standard stylus.<br /><br />Everyone who has seen it wants to use it.  And everyone that uses it wants to keep it :-P<br /><br />My only problem with the Cosmonaut is the need for a Nexus 7 cover or Android phone cover with a loop big enough to hold the Cosmonaut!  The little loops provided to store a normal-sized stylus just do not work.<br /><br />So the drawback - you need to remember where you last left the Cosmonaut (or who last \\"borrowed\\" it).
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Average, but it was Bob Dylan from the old days. Nothing really new, but there were a few unreleased songs that were good.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Flawless streaming of YouTube and NetFlix videos and movies. Our family is really enjoying the wonderful experience. Would recommend anyone.
B006AN78XS|5.0|Clever and delightful.<br />Makes me want to go to Paris!<br />If you usually like Woody Allen movies, you'll love this.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It takes a l it for me to rate a book above three stars. The kids vocabulary seems very advanced. But you can look past that when.you realize what is going on. It's heartwrenching but it also.gave me a weird sense of peace. And once you get into.it you can't put it down.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was a good action movie but the plot line seemed to get more unrealistic as the movie went on. Overall I give it 3 stars because it was entertaining but not a great movie.
B000148KK2|5.0|I entitled this as I did because this is the way Diana does her best. Just piano (Diana), guitar, bass, drums, & a Hammond organ. In other words, a combo format. I'm not that fond of her when she has a full orchestra setting, with strings and all that crap. I also don't like her in the many singer-singer things with people like Tony Bennet, etc.<br /><br />I know Diana, and she is a quiet kid, not really comfortable with the public and not as good-looking as her album jackets would have you believe. She is a great songstress but her best talent is jazz piano.<br /><br />I think the tune she wrote, \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" is the best on the album. She also wrote the lyrics. She joins Satchmo, Chet Baker, Marian McParetland as an instrumentalist who started singing by accident. Samples of the album are there so there's no need for me to mention any other tunes on the album.  Thanks!
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Dances with Wolves is one awesome movie in my eyes. It truly takes you back in time, and also gives you sight into the not so easy way<br />of life of the indians. I've watched this movie so many times, and when I found the sound track. I thought I better have it. If your like<br />me and are able to let your mind wonder with this music. Then this is a must have. A++++++++++
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|A decent action-comedy flick. Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx are about what you would expect, some of the bit actors were obviously trying too hard to be serious actors.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|Songs are based on a woman as victim model. Her live performances<br />are not doing such songs....this is an out-dated CD.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|There are plenty of bingo games out there, but is by far the best. My only complaint is that I'm totally addicted.
B006PZBR8S|3.0|Hugh tried to hard to be the bad farther, he never seemed comfortable in this role. Over all liked the movie though.
6305882592|5.0|Whatta kick this movie is - loved it!!  Apparently, this is called a &#34;dark comedy&#34; movie, but not sure what that means.  I just know we all enjoyed it immensely!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|As much as we all acknowledge meaningless sex and the use of God's name used as an expletive as part of our culture, if I'm choosing entertainment, they distract or offend. This novel is the revealing of what is in the mind of a man going through a horrible set of circumstances. I was filled with sympathy, sorrow horror and had to make the decision myself as to what was &#34;just&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the best devices I've ever purchased and I use it all the time. From casting my Chrome Browser over to the TV to MP4 files on my local system. Super Easy to set up as well.....
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This is very useful it tells me my space I have and gives me more space.It just needs to have better well I don't know what's the problem besides it not going crazy a few times that's one thing they have to fix the problems on Kindle fire hd it lags way to much (Subscribe JPGamingAD)
B00F880BWG|5.0|The walking dead is like watching a blockbuster movie that keeps going and never disapoints. Its very easy to get hooked. Love it.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Man of Steel is directed by Zack Snyder whose other movies include 300 and Watchmen.  You can really tell his influence and the special effects are amazing.  I was surprised at how well Kurt Costner and Russel Crowe with above-average performances.  The one star is because of characters of Lois Lane and General Zod, mediocre performances.  First half of the movie was excellent with a little bit too much of the fighting in the last half with the constant buildings being ruined and the throwing each other around non-sense.  Overall good film but I would rent it first.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah has a beautiful, unforgettable voice.  Love the songs, the whole album is a joy to listen too.  You can listen during work or play with equal enjoyment.
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|I love that I can see the entire equation. It even saves your history. You can go into the settings &amp; change the color as well as set the tax rate as well as a few other settings. This calculator fits my needs. I don't see scientific or trigonometry features, but then again it doesn't advertise those features. It still deserves 5 stars because it is all it advertises &amp; more.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fun read you will enjoy reading this story. From Las Vegas to sunny California, the fun keeps on. Enjoy it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Easy reading - fun adventure! Both kids and adults will love this book. It will be hard to put it down!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Wow, this set brings back so many memories. Excellent, the complete set. This was a daily bargain that I would not pass up.
0671891634|5.0|I bought it for a young friend learning the market because I am keeping my copy.  It is easy to read and understand.  Although the book is dated the principles remain the same. It should be required reading for every investor.
B008LXZFH6|4.0|Funny movie that is enjoyable to watch. Looking forward to the next in the series and would recommend watching it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have never been addicted to a video game before until now. Cutting you off after 5 lives and making you wait for more game time was a magnificent idea - I love it!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|It´s simply marvellous!!!!  A real Ghibli!!!! Just start the disk and enjoy the movie. Hope, there will be more from Studio Ghibli, soon!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game but hate the fact to get more lives you have either wait or buy. Also the 3 days waiting to move levels----really
B00915G6MG|5.0|After watching the fourth (4th) season of NCIS Los Angeles and being very disappointed in it, we turned to the original NCIS.<br /><br />What a difference in the characters, writing and displays.<br /><br />It is so far ahead of the follow up show it is a credit to all concerned.<br /><br />The quality of the episodes does not diminish over the 10th season. In fact, during the middle episodes it has lifted to another high.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended and a pleasure to watch compared with the 4th season of its sister show.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|IT IS SO GOOD. Steve Carell's last line? GOLDEN. I teared up. I laughed, I cried. Just go watch it it's priceless.
0821221841|5.0|Amazing books, the three of them. Extremely technical and useful. Covers all you need to know about film photography. Was hoping in a harder cover of the book.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Very very good movie, Not just for kids.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I buy it in bulk so that I can share it with others.  I am inspires by both sides of the issue - the young man who over came immense obstacles and the family who showed love and compassion to become a true family.  It brings tears to my eyes and hope to my heart
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Good movie, I enjoy true storries very much.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Don't start this game if you have a life and things to do or if you don't have time for a new obsession!
B00CK8CLFW|5.0|I wish I could give it more stars! I can see why it got so many great reviews. The author's ability to guide and teach a novice is  positively jaw dropping .. I have the talent but knew so little of the technique.This is an education .
B003O86FMW|5.0|I do believe this book was even better than the first.  I was reading and reading and the book just ended...I had to get the third one immediately.  It's very exciting.  This book is the beginning of the end for the oppressive government.
B00BC254I8|5.0|This book was well written. Very touching and macho -- simultaneously. It was real. Tragic. Explosive. Significant. It made me appreciate Mike and see him as a human being. What guts it must have taken to expose so much. And what a relief it must be to say the things that you want everyone to hear. I loved this book. The writer did a great job. It sounded like Mike Tyson. A lot of people aren't aware that Mike doesn't speak like a hoodlum, despite his background from the streets.  He's fairly well-spoken.  The Howard Stern interview this morning 11/13/2013 on Sirius was incredible. I had to come and review but I dont want to give away what's in the book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is a great game. If you like hidden objects this is a good one. You don't have to buy extras but you can if you would like to.
1400052173|5.0|THIS WAS A SUGGESTED BOOK TO READ, I AM SO GLAD I DID, IT HAS BEEN SO INTERESTING HOW A PART OF HER BODY IS BEING USED AS OF THIS DAY
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Story seemed rushed. Don't want to spoil anything but at some point you will realize most of the things that happened in the story were pointless.
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|Rather let the characters live in your imagination than deal with this traumatic ending after a wholly unsuccessful double narrative (Tris and Tobias take turns at their point of view which is not successful in that the  &#34;voice&#34; is not significantly distinctive)<br />If I could, I would like a refund. A great let down to what should have been a brilliant series.<br />Sorry I went there.
B00G32TD98|5.0|This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is really creepy since it is based on a true story.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Dont know why people are complaining about the plot, its been the same for about 30 years now, its not like you don't know what is going to happen after the countless superman films that have came out before. Instead I think they got it right by showing more action that was missing in previous films on a large scale, if you go see a Hulk movie you want to see him destroy thing and show off his strength. I think now that this film was a hit, we will finally get to see something more beyond superman 1, I hope they start with a different villain other than Lex like Darkseid or both and then finish the third film off with either braniac or doomsday.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This movie really sucked. Visually it was quite stunning, but overall the only good thing about it was falling asleep a little earlier.
B00942Y35S|5.0|love the movie it was different romantic i love christina ricci in this movie and the way everything worked out in the end
B00FAIL31W|5.0|A fine set. Just a warning to anybody who thinks this is a Capitol Records U.S. press; It is not. This is an Apple/ Universal press made in Europe. Apparently there is no proper U.S. vinyl pressing of this.
B0051E9INK|5.0|Excellent quality for such a great movie classic. The film captures the story and looks like it was made today considering this was released in the mid-80s where film was somewhat grainy. Thank you for bringing this classic movie to digital.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|This show is amazing! It's the best on television. I've been a huge fan since I first watched it on television, back during season 1. Jensen and Jared have really become these characters over the years. Jensen, in particular, is such a fantastic actor. He deserves much more acclaim and recognition than he has received.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My 3 year old twin grand children love doing this one.  The skills are easy for them to handle.  They love trains and building blocks.  I even find the 7 year old doing it.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Very good price for this set. My son loved it, and a visitor to our home even asked where we found it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This Kindle version of this alarm clock works better than the actual alarm clock that I bought from a department store. The clock sounds loud enough to wake me out of the deepest of sleeps.
B00A83075M|5.0|My kids absolutely love this movie and after getting it from the library and video store at least 10 times I had to buy it for Christmas for them. The movie is pretty good for parents as well as kids.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is fun and enjoyable it's not too hard not dumb and doesn't require in app purchases to keep playing I keep going back to it for a few levels
B0042TV4IC|1.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is one of my favorite TV shows. My family owns the DVDs already, but I decided to watch an episode through Amazon Instant Video since they are available in HD. To my disappointment, the episodes on Amazon Instant Video are edited for length. I only watched the first episode, but there were 2-3 minutes missing! Some of the missing scenes have important information in them. It is misleading for Amazon to not to mention this.<br /><br />Lark Rise to Candleford is a wonderful show that deserves at least 4 stars. The one-star review is for Amazon's edited version.
1609613937|5.0|JOHN MCDOUGALL MAKES IT EASY TO EAT A VEGAN DIET WHILE IMROVING YOUR HEALTH AND LOSING WEIGHT. AND HIS BOOKS ARE EASY TO UNDERSTAND.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Slow and a waste of my money. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I did not like it at all.
6305882592|5.0|This is my movie that the love of my life and I s=went to on our &#34;blind date&#34;&#62; It is quirky - have watched it over and over. Love has no boundaries!!!!!!
B002W1UEW4|4.0|I liked the action in this movie and would love to recommend this movie to a friend and looking for other parts of this movie to come
B00004VW0W|5.0|One of the best - the music is still great - for any generation to enjoy! Be sure to spread the music...
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This game is okay. It has great graphics and many weapons. One of the problems with it is that it may not load and it when it does that it blocks out all of your apps. Pretty good game overall.
1476727651|5.0|This is King at his very best.  Superbly well-written, tight plot/storyline, fleshed-out characters, everything you'd like to see from the master of horror.  I highly recommend this book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The whole family enjoyed it, had us in stitches at times, the humor was reasonably clean for all, but funny!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I couldn't finish this book due to the sex scenes and the feeling of<br />hopelessness that hung over it.  I returned it. No plot is enticing<br />enough to keep me dragging through this.
B006UW4OB8|1.0|I've used this many years on Window PC and a series of Windows CE devices before smart phones existed. But now having to pay $10 for an app that will not function unless connected to Amazon is absolutely, totally unacceptable. That means I have to enter TWO IDs and TWO passwords to enter the app, and use my limited data access for absolutely no good reason. Entering one with big fingers is hard enough.<br /><br />I will be looking for another password manager. I should get a refund, it does not function as described.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Lifelong fan here who is very impressed with this album!<br /><br />I hear minor keys of old mixed with a modern sound.<br />I hear the high vocals expected mixed with huge chorus bliss.<br />I hear dueling solos, killer bass, and huge booming drums.<br />I hear Stryper in their prime.<br /><br />Thanks guys from a huge fan!  I feel like I'm 20 again. I hope my 42 year old ears can handle this because it will be cranked to 10 daily.<br /><br />See you on tour!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTIVE!! It's a strategy game that gets your mind going. Love this game. Pet Rescue is pretty cool as well.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|What's not to love? Halloween retro movie night. Grandkids and I gather round, stay up late, see who can stay awake the longest.
B00ESB75FA|4.0|Started off kind of dry, I thought.  But it's starting to shape up to become what I fell in love with.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|really cool new age movie with tom cruise, desert scenes and old ruins made it cool. some good twists that make it interesting, overall a 4 star movie
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love it its better then where's my water I don't know if u Agrey but maybe this game would be top 3rd place cause minecraft is top 1st place maybe if it had upgrades in it maybe the whole world would like or love it aloha minecraft is awesome hahaha (p.s. aloha means goodbye and hello)
B000V39KDO|5.0|Excellent movie! Great script. Fantatic acting by some wonderful actors and actresses. What more is there to say? This is a must see!
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Bought it for a song or two I heard on the radio.  Now I like the entire CD.  Haven't tried anything else by them.
B0070R40V6|4.0|About the book: Its very impressive, i first saw the hbo serie, but now reading the book its like seeing the story for the first time. The level of details and description its something thats would be impossible to show on tv.<br /><br />About the kindle format: its all i would expect from a book. I use with ma paperwhite and Android App. The characters list is on the final pages, so now my devices register as the last page read that list, making very hard to syncronize between my devices. Maybe i just dont understand well my paperwhite yet... or its really a problem.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I - liked - this movie when I first saw it a few years ago.  Subsequently I saw it about once a year... and got more and more into it.  So I bought a copy.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun and addictive game. Easy to play my kindle. Now I need to come up older a few more  words.
0545128285|3.0|I've bought a couple of these as gifts for other people.  So far, nobody's complained.  I rather gather, though, that full appreciation requires having read the Hairy Potty books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is not only fun to use but actually useful! I may never by another magazine again!<br />Thousands of great ideas with a touch of your fingertips and no pages to tear out and store.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|It's just good all the way through.  Bought it for the track or two I heard on the radio, then was delighted by the whole CD.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|This movie is fun for everyone; both short and tall.  Proof that a good movie doesn't have to be from hollywood and cost 100 million to make.
B004GYY714|1.0|Ordered the app to listen to live football broadcasts.  Unfortunately the broadcast during the game was a talk show repeat from the day before.  Also, the radio station cut out every minute or 2, sometimes out for several minutes.  I've since uninstalled.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|i am so sucked into this game it is so fun and you can go back and replay the levels. it offers tons of levels and fun for adults and kids.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, but can be nerve racking! Very addictive and yet a lot of fun. Wish there was more moves on level 178. Lol
B0088O11NU|3.0|kids like this game i am not a fan. its hard and does not move like the real thing. and it is timed.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Iron Man 3 - What's not to like - action, action, action - adventure - lots of visual effects - fun to watch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my kids and husband are stucked into this game bad. great to keep them busy and there minds thinking. easy game to play
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This is a nice game, but the damn thing only works if you're logged in to Appstore. My Android is a player and isn't normally logged in to the Internet, which means the game is worthless unless you're logged into this site. I wish game reviews would warn people about this requirement. So a thumbs down on the game and Appstore!
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|Some pretty groovy songs, but the theme can get old.  Can only listen to it once a day or so.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for many years now and each new book seems to be more inane.  This book began with flashbacks to the Sandy Hook Elementary school shootings, where she apparently autopsied many of the victims.  I was horrified to think that Cornwell would exploit one of the worst school shootings in America for profit.  I am on the third chapter and don't think I will finish this one.  Sadly disappointed in you for doing this Patricia.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I think that the good songs are really good, but there are only 3 good ones.  The rest aren't terrible, but I can't bring myself to put it on the whole album.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|If you love this series this season will make you happy. If you are smart you will stop here. Good luck with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's easy to play<br />Sometimes I get stuck then I have to plan my moves<br />It a wonderful game.play alone or with friends
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|Blokus on the go! Great conversion. The only downside is, it is either 4-player or 1-player. You cannot assign AI to any number of players basically.
B00F3W9NQ2|4.0|Its gone down hill a bit thus season but its still great.if tort reading this I assume you already plan on buying it
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is a fantastic conversion of the board game with the same name. The real board game is fun with friends, but it's not as fast to set it up. This digital version lets you play with up to 4 players with any number of human/AI in the mix. Great sound and animation. A must-have.
B00BDSRFG0|5.0|Awesome guitar work.Like the vocals.Great 70's heavy rock.Real stuff.Kick-ass, no-kidding, no none sense.Do recommend their other albums specialy On Fire and Demons.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great.  It has improved now to the point where it will automatically switch my TV to the right input source for the Chromecast when I start casting, so I don't have to look for the regular remote control.<br /><br />We need the ability to stream personal videos and pictures. I imagine that the personal stuff has been blocked for personal security reasons.  If this is the case then users need to be informed that if they are streaming over a shared network that there is a possibility that the personal stuff may be intercepted.  Then we can adjust and use the device accordingly.<br /><br />I like it enough to have purchased 3. Even if the TV has smart apps I find that searching for content is much easier from the Android device than it was with a Traditional TV or Blu Ray remote control.
B00004W3L3|5.0|Great stuff.Love hus voice and the guitar work.<br />Great band with one of a kind style.The whole band is really good.Very good musicianship and arrangements.I wish they never brock up.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great story line.  Many twist and turns, ie. red herrings.  Keeps you guessing.  Great acting.  Looking forward to the third season.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Why is the govener still alive ? Lame. Why isnt WD on hulu? So the govener went to the university and released the swine flu with the new doctor to kill all the survivors there just to send the walkers to the prison for vengance. Now that would make up why he is around.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|I love this movie. It's so super cute! Just a great all around family movie for any age. Even teenagers love it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Satisfying hunts, slow-mo final shot as well. Various animals on various maps, some of the predators will attack you if not killed with one blow. So stay on your toes lol.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There are a lot of characters to keep track of initially, but this book reminds me of the movie Magnolia.  There are all these separate story lines and they end up intersecting in the end.  Awesome
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My family and I just love this movie! Our Christmas season wouldn't be complete if we couldn't watch Christmas vacation. Now that I bought the DVD we don't have to wait to see it on TV.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It work good........but if you have apple products you are looking to use with it you should look elsewhere. (Only run U tube) bought an Apple TV an that works great.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I found the info about Tesla very interesting but there wasn't enough about him.  I thought it may have been a biography but really, it's about many other things too.  Still enjoyable, for what it's worth.
0802473156|3.0|Very good book. Helps you understand the people in your life. I'm sending a copy to each of my kids.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Love getting my movies from amazon. Always on time and great quality. I use pre-orders when I can cause I'm sure to get my movie on the day it comes out
B004T340QY|5.0|Terrific film - the script is clever, the physical comedy is truly gifted, and the classical references are both pointed and hysterically funny.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|A unique talent has combined with a sensitivity to life in a changing era to produce this album.  It is genius to put it out early, before the live show which will include these songs &#34;hits the boards.&#34;  People will know and love these songs, and leave the theater with &#34;ear worms&#34;.  Prediction is always dangerous, but this music is so good it would be hard to mess up a stage production of &#34;The Last Ship.&#34;
B00FEN000S|3.0|Not with the &#34;virtual&#34; cost of the video...but otherwise an ok movie. Should just rent it in RedBox and save the $11.00.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|This, I think, is the best Iron Man movie made so far.  The villains were convincing and story telling was superb.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I loved this book and how it explains the, previously, inexplicable triumphs of Davids.  Heartwarming and mind enriching.  Worthwhile read.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This movie was excellent.  I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but I enjoyed this move.  Its intricate plot will separate it from others.
B00BHSEKAK|4.0|The case is well made and of high quality leather, looks good, and does do a fine job protecting the camera, though it is just a bit fussy to put on and take off.  (Note that I'd previously written that the bottom portion of the case partially obscured the LCD screen and covered some of the control buttons on the camera back. Mea culpa - I'd just gotten the case and simply had it on backward. Duh.  Anyway, I've now modified my review and upped the rating to four stars).
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|This movie was just like the other teen fantasy movies that are being poured out right now, bland.  I'm not sure what could have helped this movie other than showing the credits a lot sooner.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son loves this. He has 3 different characters. I love this product also. It's a life saver at times when baby is cranky or hungry.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|This was a good sequel thanks mostly to the charisma of the Rock.  It was disheartening how Channing Tatum had such a little role in this movie.  I would give it a chance, I think most would be pleasantly surprised.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|2nd time through, better than 1st.  Can we get the kindle version updated with US paperback preview chapter from WoW?
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would given the reviews it received.  I would suggest this movie to anyone that enjoys a fantasy movie with a lot of comedy built in.  Plus Ewan McGregor was great in it.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Epic fantasy action drama. Sucker punch is a very unique story. I dont want to give away much but the soundtrack is also very cool.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This has to be one of the most original plots I have seen in some time.  I can forgive some of the cheesy effects because of how good the movie was.
0060005696|5.0|If you are contemplating getting this book and would love a preview I'd suggest going to TED.com and watching his 20 minute speech about this book.  I read it while out to sea and thought it was a great read.  The majority of the book focuses on how the increasing your options doesn't always increase your happiness.<br /><br />On a side note, I help younger couples do financial planning and budgeting.  This book has several factors that talk about  financial investment's and individuals usually not participating due to too many choices.  Would definitely suggest to any young couple or young adult (or those who do not plan for  retirement).
B00F35BV64|5.0|The latest Star Trek movie is even better than the first.  The appearance of one of Star Trek's greatest villains, played superbly by Benedict Cumberbatch, was just the icing on the cake.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I FIND IT USEFULL PLAYING WORDGAMES OTHERWISE I DO NOT USE IT WHEN WRITING OR READING ANYTHING<br /><br />EASY TO USE
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|This was a very original movie, especially coming from Dreamworks.  My family enjoyed it immensely.  And Nic Cage was hilarious in this.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Inspiring, visionary and well written.<br />It tends to repeat itself a little at the beginning, but overall a great book. I read it in a few days and got full of ideas for new projects based on what is described in the book.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I liked the movie and especially how much of it helps Agents of SHIELD make more sense, but I hated how they downplayed one of Marvel's greatest villians.
B00FOU1O3S|2.0|This is a real fun game and it is so cute, too.  However, after playing about five games it froze my Kindle Fire and I had to shut my Kindle down to get off the game.  After that my Kindle Fire would not start up again and I had to do the 20 second hold on the start button thing to get my Kindle Fire working again.  Now I am afraid to play the game for fear that it will freeze my Kindle Fire again.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I liked this band, but I didn't think it was as good as the Civil Wars.  So if you like Mumford and Sons, definitely check out the Civil Wars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy it is now compatible with the Kindle Fire Hd.  I had liked it on my phone and wanted it on my tablet.  The other similar games were just not the same as having the real Candy Crush Saga.
B007V5XT1O|4.0|Good rhythmic beat. And Carrie has such a sweet, but robust voice that really shows her emotions through the lyrics
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Excellent album by John!  The selections are so beautiful and positive.  This one should be a keepsake for any romantic.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|This is a wonderful Disney Classic and my two year old grandson thinks he's Peter Pan!  Thanks for the great service!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Thor was a good movie for lots of special effects and good graphics. If you look close there is a cameo from Stan lee I the diner scene.
0062103377|5.0|amazing book. couldnt ask for better. love the organization, the pictures, the author. everything. wonderful read! a must buy for any fan
B002VWNIDG|5.0|This was a great movie with a great price. The quality of the movie was as expected and awesome. This was a great buy.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Really good movie. My dad and son watch this movie everyday they love it. Its nice to see the happenings around a movie.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|It was a great and thrilling book with a mind blowing twist in the story. What a great book! :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love mlp ( my little pony ) but why gems for rarity. Ponies that are royal like princess celestia should cost gems but not that many. I still have a lot of quests for ponies that need gems to get. But great game.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|very entertaining!!!! lots of action, never a dull moment, kept your interest the whole movie !  a must see movie if you like action movies!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Amaaaziiinnnnggg!!! So perfect my Fav Song<br />1-Manicure<br />2-Dope<br />3-Gypsy<br />4- venus<br />5- Do what you want<br />6- APPLAUSE<br />7-Fashion!<br />8-Donatella<br />9-Aura<br /><br />AND More<br />so impressed ~!!!
B00DSLZCR4|5.0|The kind of read that is laugh out loud funny! But not the kind of comedy you have to think too hard to 'get'.
B004XZR63M|2.0|The book is well written but for me,personally,I had a hard time getting into it. I gave up after a few chapters.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|If you are interested how people overcome fear in oppressive traditional cultures this is a good read.  I found her descriptions of her upbringing to be interesting given my western experience.  Her parents are the true hero's, and she clearly promotes their influence as instrumental in the development of her worldviews.  Their influence was the impetus for her stand on allowing women access to education in the face of the Taliban.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game every chance I get. Actually, I find myself making time for it when I should be doing other things. It is very relaxing...what else can I say. Simply put &#34;I Love It.&#34;
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Very encouraging for those that face disadvantages or work with people that are aware of their disadvantages.  Inspires the reader to look for ways to use painful experiences or disadvantages to bring deeper meaning to the human experience.  The authors exploration of the power of forgiveness opens the door for emotional healing for the reader.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|love Michael Moore it a laugh to watch, buy it now! Would recommend to all especially if you need a laugh.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but also solvable.  Very addictive! Can't wait to play more of these games.  I would encourage anyone to give it a try.
B000SINT52|5.0|love Michael Moore it a laugh to watch, buy it now! Would recommend to all especially if you need a laugh.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It tells me a lot of words and some I do not know and I like the dictionary a lot
B00FJTWK0U|5.0|Excellent performances, meaningful subject matter.  A worthy successor to the previous &#34;before&#34; movies.  One wonders just where they go from here, hoping that they are not torn apart by their separate challenges.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app. It is so much fun and a great game to help pass tome by. I also play this when I'm mad or mad.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great right out of the box.  Easy to install. Working for me within a few minutes of receiving the delivery. No problems so far.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This show is so great. Wonderful stories and amazing actors. The scenery is gorgeous. I only wish there were more than 3 episodes to a season.
B00F3VOL38|3.0|Ever since discovering Kevin Howlett's book \\"The Beatles at the BEEB\\" and first listening to the 1994 CDs \\"Live at the BBC,\\" I have been fascinated by these early recordings of live broadcast performances.  As that first album made it to #3 on the Billboard LP chart and went quadruple platinum in sales, why did it take 19 years to get volume two released?<br /><br />As a look at the track listing will show, this is a combination of songs they wrote and remakes of other people's songs, and also a mixture of songs they released commercially and songs they never released on singles, EPs, or albums.  I have no complaints about any of the musical selections or performances, or the spoken intros and interludes.<br /><br />My big complaint is about the crappy packaging.  It is difficult to remove the discs from the sleeves and to reinsert them, without getting fingerprints and skin oil on the playing surfaces.  That's a pretty serious shortcoming.  The booklet, on the other hand, is TOO easily removed from its pocket, to the point of readily falling out while you're trying to get the discs in or out.  The first BBC set came in a plastic case.  Unlike the second volume's cardboard digipak container, it's easy to access and replace the discs and the booklet in that packaging.<br /><br />If you only listen to this album on your iPod, iPad, or other electronic device, the packaging will be of no concern, and for you I'd give this set 5 stars.  But for Old People like me, who strongly prefer their music in a physical format (which is more durable long term than a blip on your PED), I knock it all the way down to 3 stars for the terrible packaging.
1476747016|5.0|I purchased the paper copy of this cute and comical story about the lovely cat Pusheen. I first came across Pusheen on facebook (with the emoticons)and my boyfriend and I send them back and forth so Pusheen has been a special part of my life and once I heard there would be a physical copy of these comics, I couldn't wait!<br /><br />I rated this 5 stars even though I have already seen some of the comics, it was still a lovely read. The paper is nice and thick, and very good quality pictures. Going along with that note, there's A LOT more pictures than I expected! Which is totally worth the value even if shipping was expensive. Overall this book will put a smile to your face no matter your age.
B003G4W49C|5.0|An amazing story of knowledge and forgiveness.  A story of using your knowledge for the good and how forgiveness plays a huge part in personal growth.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Once you read this book, you'll never see life the same way and the people around you. I always tell everyone to read this book because it really changed my life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|To start off with this book is AMAZING!!! Some of the parts that kept me hanging on was all the times when Katniss had to face difficult disisions, Peeta overcame, Gale getting angry, President  Snow, and a whole lot more. So if you are looking for a fun on going book  thaan you will LOVE Mockingjay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Iv been looking for candy crush for a wile then i found out there wasnt one but now that there is im glade + its free
140123755X|4.0|Entertaining and clever writing, a unique twist on classic fairytale characters and scenarios.  Good enough that I'm getting the second one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just can't get enough of the game. There is always a challenge when u play this game. It passes time by quickly too
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga has evolved POP music yet again. Layers upon layers of meaning in her lyrics and the music has some incredible original sounds and effects. Needs to be listened real LOUD to get full effect :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent as a sequel or stand-alone book. I am not Stephen King's biggest fan as I am not that into supernatural books, but this, along with &#34;The Shining&#34; was great.  It was not as gory as &#34;The Shining&#34;, but still spooky enough I was glad I was not sleeping alone.
B005J4TLQG|1.0|There were two reasons I wanted to see this film - 1) I love seeing new movie monsters and 2) Nick Frost was in it. After the first 30 minutes you are introduced to the first characters none of whom have one thing to root for so I assume they are the meat for the coming horde and someone like Frost would take the reigns to be the hero - so I waited for the deaths of theses hoodlums. It never came - granted a few dropped off but these were the kids that had a glimmer of hope of redemption. The ones you want to die horribly, survive. I liked the creatures - they were new and different and that was what I was looking for. The rest of the movie was a complete waste of time listening to kids trying to be tough, trash talking to bad rap music and painful accents.<br />There is no character growth, no support for the characters even though this takes place in a city, it's contrived and so full of stereotypes that it is painful to watch.<br />The behind the scenes special feature would be given a higher rating than the movie itself. It was at least funny, informative, and showed the creatures better.
140053271X|4.0|I previously owned a Kindle and loved it, but it kept breaking.  I finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced 3 times in the first year.<br /><br />I bought the Nook Simple Touch to replace it, and am very satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />To be honest, the Kindle is brighter and easier to read in less-than-perfect light.  However the Nook excels in nearly every other way.<br /><br />1) Nook is sturdily reliable.  I have had no failures with it whatsoever, although I carry it everywhere and use it daily.  I do have it in a protective case, but I had my Kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway.  POINT:  NOOK.<br /><br />2) Nook Simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent Kindle e-reader.  Nevertheless, screen-size is ample.<br /><br />3) Nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than Kindle.<br /><br />4) Books download in a blink and are immediately available.  This too seems faster than with my Kindle.<br /><br />5) There are some things I could do with my Kindle that I can't do with my Nook Simple Touch, but I don't miss those things.  I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.  POINT: NOOK.<br /><br />Generally, if you are shopping for an inexpensive, simple e-reader, I strongly urge you to buy the Nook, and not the Kindle.  I have tried both, and prefer the Nook.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It kept me interested right through to the end.  Many interesting twists made it unpredictable.  I would recommend it highly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a solitaire addict and this supplies my &#34;fix&#34; while I am on my Kindle. It is neat even with the ads.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|best game ever!!!! wish you didn't have to wait woo long for lives.But fun and addicting!!! The movie is awesome as well. Makes you really want to play :)
B00DZJ82VC|5.0|FINALLY!!!! A remastering job worthy of this fine album. The overall sound quality and attention to detail are outstanding. If you love this album, as I do, you won't be sorry with making this purchase, especially at this price.
B004UBM4TA|1.0|Well I would have been pleased to give a Five Star Review if I had gotten the IMAX: Hubble 3D (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy Combo Pack) instead all I got was the 3D Blu-ray. I don't have away to watch this at the moment since I don't own a 3D Blu-ray player yet. However I do plan on buying one before the year is out but I wanted to watch the movie before that time just disappointed in the seller.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|In stead of adding more all the time why don't you consentrate on quality.to many glitches all the time. To much going on at one time.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD THIS App and use it there is no Alarm clock Installed. You must then buy the upgrade for 99 cents.  So if its a free App with a full program included for NO Money find another App BUT ITS WORTH 99 cents for this APP!
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|Very much like the Prime Minister. So interesting to watch Meryl Streep take on a role and bring back the memories of a great lady.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Very good. Sometimes, even in fiction, justice is served. Held my attention and there could not have been a better ending.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It has been probably 20 years since I have read a Stephen King novel.  20 years ago I had all his books in hardback and read everything he wrote.  He has a way of scarring me like no other author.  I loved Doctor Sleep.  I couldn't sleep nights for wanting to read more.  It was a surprise to me when Dan from the Shining was the main character.  I remembered that book and also the movie.  Okay, now Stephen King has me hooked again!
B004F77SHC|5.0|great terrific it is the best ever you all should give it a try it is so worth it. yeah!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved the book. It was way better than the movie. Clear character voices. Interesting and compelling. Worth a read.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|All i have to say is wow what an amazing movie.one of the best super hero movies if not superman movies in history loved it!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I just finished reading Allegiant and I may be going slightly against the grain here, but the only redeeming quality about the book was the ending. If the author did not kill off Tris or Tobias, then the whole book would have been a meandering pointless mess. At least she bothered to get around to the purpose of the series toward the end....sort of. I think...I'm still not sure what the 'central thesis' was. Maybe - if you die for someone, it's the ultimate way to show you love them. Or - We can all ascend from bad times if we have our pals with us. Or - war (huh) what is it good for?<br /><br />It was bad. I felt like Allegiant belonged to a completely different series. The first book, and arguably the second in the series were about the characters. Allegiant was about...well, I'm still working on that. After about ten chapters the whole thing got so messy and convoluted that the characters got lost. The author spends this insane amount of time writing about gene purity and scientific hokum and who hates who and why, and who's vision is lost and why. There's the Bureau and the citizens and the GP and the GD and fringes and the Allegient, and the Factions and the Factionless and the people who just want to have their memories erased, and the people who are sad that people have died, and the people who have died - and that's just scratching the surface. Too many directions. Way to many. The whole story of Tris and Tobias was lost. The entire sub plot involving Nita and Uriah and the failed  'plan' could have been taken out of the book altogether and it still would have 'arrived' in the same place. The characters couldn't shine through the mire of sub plot and I stopped caring about them.<br /><br />It was an unsatisfactory ending to a series that started on a high note and then....nose dive.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Like colours,<br />Good layout of puzzles<br /><br />Really like the graphics<br />Like app store<br />East to use easy to follow<br />Easy to follow
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was interesting and I felt that the characters were well developed. It was profound and I found myself thinking about it long after I was finished reading it. It was well written and intelligent. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because I've never met a teenager in my life capable of such introspection. The vocabulary wasn't consistent with the age of the character. It doesn't effect the impact though. Just something you have to take in stride. Great read.
1451695195|5.0|This is a definitive work from the ultimate sceptic, well educated and entrenched in the scientific community, he describes his own extraordinary near death experience for the world to understand clearly that we Do in fact have consciousness and life after death.  What a valuable perspective for us to embrace in this earthly life that all of us wrestle with.
B005MHI0QM|4.0|This a terrific book I love it, it is awesome I would read this book a lot. It is a girl named Anne Frank they are in world war 2 and they are trying not to be caught ,so with out said it is sad and a excellent book. Oh almost forgot Anne falls in love with Peter the boy who is staying with them. At the end they get caught so pretty much they die at the camp they go to. READ IT NOW
0739378341|5.0|A little different from his other books, and a little the same.  Just enough to keep you guessing with a great ending.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|Love this movie!! It is so funny! Mel Gibson is great in this movie. I ordered this DVD on a Friday night with standard shipping and it was in my mailbox the next day. I was amazed at how quickly it came.
0525425772|5.0|I enjoy anything and everything John Grisham writes.  And I enjoy books with young people with a good head on their shoulder.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It was a powerful and true to life story that made me think about the people who's hands my life is in when I fly.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My kid loves this.<br /><br />The tractor is plastic. The front wheels don't turn. But that's okay, because the tractor does other cool things. The backhoe and the front shovel part move really well. If, using the backhoe, you reach for something to scoop, the bucket bit opens and when you bring the arm back, the bucket bit folds under to really hold what you scooped up. I know I'm doing a poor job describing, but trust me, it's cool. The arms click into place. There are stabilizers that click in and out of place. And the backhoe is removable !<br /><br />Just buy it.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|This is a good set.  If you are going to get Planet Earth, don't cheap out.  Get the one narrated by David Attenborough.  He is legit.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Hours upon hours have been spent playing this over the last year. It is quite simply the best mobile game I have I have ever played on any platform, save plants v zombies. It is a must buy for kindle owners.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First book in an incredible series. Haven't been this excited about an author in quite awhile. Loved every bit of it. Pacing, prose, story, everything was top notch.
B00BEYX7TW|1.0|Didn't keep me interested. Found it slow moving. Usually I like Tommy Lee Jones  but the story line or directing just didn't do it.
1934030198|5.0|Excellent reference book for training or coaching. Lots of good workouts. In general, very good book for learning how to train, particularly in a traditional, linear fashion.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|Excellent performance from ALL lead actors. Excellent story. Well directed and well written. Don't want to say much more, but well worth the view!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love this thing. I never remember to charge my headset and it always ends up dead. With this, it's always charged.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|If this isn't slow going. Tried three times to watch it. Outside of the plane crash, I was falling asleep.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|First book is excellent. Second is OK. Third is terrible. The direction the series took ended up making it one of the least enjoyable and most irritating series I've read. The rating is only as good as it is, because the first book is a 5, the next and is a 3, and the last is a 1. But when you finish out so poorly, it just leaves a bad taste in your month.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Pretty good... and pretty scary.  I liked it a lot. However, friends of mine did not care for it.  I thought it was well done. and that the ending was pretty good.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Extremely well written, interesting, exciting and evidently well researched.  Great job! No wonder she won the Booker prize for 2013.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|This is without question the most realistic version of the apocolypse, American style.  This story is very believable, and pretty much should freak you out.<br />I have the SD version as well, and you can tell the difference in the video with this Blu ray.<br />I want Max on my team if the time comes!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the creativity of the telling of the story from the viewpoint of Death and with the backdrop of WWII. The flow of the story kept me engaged from start to end. You could feel the pain, and the small joys of the reality of living during that time.  The characters were fabulous. I wished I could know them. And in the end, the tears and Kleenex is the connection to the story. I can't wait to tell someone to read it!
B00FMFEA68|4.0|As a long term fan I found this to be a very easy and interesting read. He is of course totally mad, passionate, bitter and twisted, poetic, bitchy, pretentious and hopelessly romantic, in the best sense of the word. He is not, as the nay-sayers and non-believers would have it, miserable.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|enjoyable film, steve carell did an excellent job.  suggested to girlfriend the other evening an free willing watched it for the second time.  still laughed and smiled
1936891026|5.0|The only self help book that I can suggest to everyone. I have, am and will continue to tell as many people as possible about this mind blowing book.
1589949811|5.0|I knew from the first quest that we played that we would be playing this game for a long time. I don't personally find much replay value in any given adventure, but there are so many between those included in this box and all the adventure packs, that it would be a long time before that even became an issue. The art on the cards is amazing, the flavor quotes are interesting and relevant to the card, the mechanics are fun. The rules are a little complex for novice gamers, but once you learn them they become second nature. If you've ever played Magic: the Gathering or similar card games, you will pick this game up naturally. The fact that it is 100% cooperative is a fresh take on the card game scene for our group, and a welcome change.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|My daughter-in-law recommended this author last year when I was looking for something to read. I started with Sarum and loved it. It is long, but that is what I was looking for. I love history and the author weaves a fascinating story with a lot of interesting detail. I am sure someone could nit pick things in the book, but I found it very readable and fun. It brought all the history of this area to life. I read London after this and am halfway through Russka. I Love Edward Rutherford and look forward to reading everything he has written.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I\\"LL CALL MYSELF \\"575\\", AS MANY HAVE CAME BEFORE ME AS TO ME WRITING THIS REVIEW. \\"SABBATH (JOB) EXECUTED!!!\\" AFTER MANY YEARS OF NO SOUL ON THIS PLANET KNOWING IF THIS WAS EVER GOING TO ACTUALLY BE A REALITY OR A THING TO UNFORTUNATELY NEVER BE, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A ROCK N' ROLL CATASTROPHE. SOME OF THE GREATEST ROCKER'S TO EVER GRACE FOOT ON THIS PLANET HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM OUR EXISTENCE BY DEATH OR HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE HOLLYWOOD POLITICAL ISSUES! THIS RESULTS INTO SO MUCH LOST TALENT THAT WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY......BUT NOT \\"BLACK SABBATH\\"! THEY HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY MADE AN EXCELLENT CLASSIC STYLE SABBATH ALBUM THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OUTDONE! OZZY SOUNDS AMAZING, TONY BLEW MY MIND, I MEAN LISTEN TO THAT GUITAR! GEEZER IS RIGHT THERE IN HARMONY WITH IOMMI LIKE I HAVEN'T HEARD IN OVER A DECADE, AND I MUST POINT OUT I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT AMAZON DOES NOT MENTION BRAD WILK ON DRUMS FROM THEIR EDITORIAL REVIEWS LISTED ABOVE, I MEAN THE GUY DID A FANTASTIC JOB! I AM SURE MANY SABBATH FANS OF OLD AND NEW WILL REDISCOVER THIS ALBUM FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES! BECAUSE THIS IS HARDCORE ROCK N' ROLL! OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT \\"GOTHIC DOOM METAL\\" AND IT'S PERFORMED AT THE ABSOLUTE FINEST. THIS WITHOUT A DOUBT IN THE LONG RUN WILL BE UP THERE WITH OTHER CLASSIC BLACK SABBATH ALBUMS LIKE SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH, MASTER OF REALITY OR EVEN HEAVEN AND HELL......AS OZZY SAY'S \\"I LOVE YOU ALL\\" - \\"I LOVE THIS ALBUM\\"......GOODNIGHT!
B000002B5L|5.0|The best album of the 90's before Lauryn Hill went on her own. Killing me softly is a must have when cleaning the living room!
6305064490|5.0|What can I say about a classic that still makes me cry?  My kids are now fans since we bought this DVD.  James Stewart gives one of his most inspired performances. Remember, &#34;Every time a bell rings . . . .&#34;
B00005AQE8|5.0|The best album Tupac made. Girls get your exercise clothes on and your jogging shoes, turn this up and let's go!
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|This soundtrack takes me right back to Middle Earth!  Howard Shore weaves some familiar LOTR themes in with many exciting and inspiring new ones for The Hobbit.  This music is top notch!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love to play this on my Kindle Fire at work to distress. Yes  I love it to play. Yes I Do
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day, and I've loved it!  I've had it for several months now, and keep coming back to it.  It is great to play if you have only a minute or two, or if you have half and hour.  While simplistic in nature, it does become challenging at higher levels if you want perfect scores.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am mentoring a 3 rd.  grader at a school and I can download things on my kindle and use it when I see him.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Enjoy playing.  Challenging and entertaining.  All my friends have it.  You're asking for too much information.  Shorten it.  Thanks. srt
B008N7Q2SQ|4.0|It's a great textbook for those looking to understand literary theories. It's put in plain language which is great for those new to theories.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Not usually a Woody Allen fan at all nor do I like Owen Wilson in particularly.  But the sense of Paris in the 1880s when it was blooming with creativity and wild personalities is so real, not only to the main character but to the audience.  It's quite easy to take this strange and wonderful trip with him!
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Awesome movie for all ages! Lots of laughs and uplifting with great morals! My three year old's new favorite movie!
B00BAWEGPW|5.0|My 7 son year old son really enjoyed this book. The drawings were cute. He's excited about the second one. Very imaginative. Only two nights to finish.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Extremely scary movie. Was on the edge of my seat every minute of it. Con, movie was rather dark was hard to see.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|This is an awesome movie with great special effects.good and fun for the kids. Very entertaining, from start to finish.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Had second thoughts about the series when I first started reading this third book because of the way the author wrote it but by the end it made perfect sense why she gave Tobias's perspective as well. Was crying my eyes out by the end.<br />Very good book to read. Lots of life lessons!
140006922X|5.0|I learned a lot from reading this book.  It really is a good historical view of Jesus' era and gives thought to different views.
B0014C0BMU|1.0|Bad quality video. The image was not good all the time. It did not have subtitles and it will be better to have it in HD. This one does not work well and the images gets frozen many times.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|The movie was funny in parts.  We enjoyed watching the movie, but don't have any desire to watch it again.  It's just not one of those movies that you love and want to watch several times.  Some of my Disney favorites include The Incredilbes, Tangled, and The Princess and The Frog.
B00G0KY1UO|1.0|Keeps flipping.can't play it at all! Do not pay for this app . I would love to play it .I debuted on spending the money for over one week .dam that sucks!!!!!!!!!!
B008CIUS72|1.0|I got this app for use on my Kindle Fire.  I can't get ANY flash on my Kindle & I'm very unhappy about that!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun . Road rage all you like. Drift and bump your way to the lead .
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Loads of fun.  A bit indulgent at times, but the story moves along nicely and there are definitely some very entertaining 80's throwbacks.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! The boards vary so you never know if it will be an easy one or a hard one. The only negative is that it takes too long to get your lives built back up.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Sometimes you just need to read a Grisham novel.  Its a fast read, and not challenging in any way.  It's good for what it is, and you know exactly what youre going to get.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It's even better than the first. READ IT. James Daschner definitely is a genius with this book. Can't wait to read the next book
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Divergent and Insurgent were orders of magnitude better than Allegiant.  It was a below-average ending to an otherwise above-average series.  This third installment rambles and goes on tangents that are left unfinished.  The first and second books are not told in the same style as the third and, honestly, I did not care for this new style of the third book.  Why bother splitting up the story telling between Tris and Four?  Its entirely unnecessary.  I'm disappointed in this book.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|Not as good as I'd hoped. For a series centred around Vamps, they play a very minor role in this book...
B003G4W49C|5.0|This story is so rich, I absolutely enjoyed reading it.  It is very easy to be completely drawn in by this book.  I couldnt put it down.  A great read!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not real sure yet I just started playing, but so it has kept my attention.  So far seems pretty easy to navigate through.  Tutorial was very helpful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun, but it's also challenging.  When I first started using it, it seemed too easy. As I started moving up to higher levels it became a lot more exciting. My one criticism would be that it gives away hints/moves too quickly.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This changed my eating habits! Everyone needs to see this. I donated it it to a local urban farm. They showed it to the entire neighborhood.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Super fun to watch. Love the characters; each one is interesting and the dynamics among the group is so outstanding. I do not have any experience whatsoever with law firms to know if Suits is realistic or not. But I don't really care. I'm not watching it like a documentary, I'm watching it for entertainment. It takes my mind off my problems for awhile successfully. Five stars for me, articulates that.
B00G0KY1UO|1.0|It fails to run at all on my Kindle Fire HD 7 inch....maybe you will have better luck on other devices.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Awesome sound quality and  comfortable! Replaced a pair of Vengeance 2000s, wish I had purchased these to begin with. Wow much comfort very sound.
0307477479|5.0|What a fun read.  Lively satire about our times that helps answer the question, &#34;What Happened To Kids Who Grew Up In The 1980s?&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging, yet doable. Like the fact that you don't have to go all the way back to the beginning if you can't get through a level because it lets you try and try until you've succeeded.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|everything was clear and good .... amazon rocks!!! need more movies like this hope they get more soon i really like this service.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's the standard for reading PDF documents, and always getting better. I've relied on Adobe Reader for years, and the application has exceeded my expectations.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Great book.  Good character development.  Perfect for teenage girls (13 years old).  Quick read and entertaining; perfect for kindle engagement.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|At this time, I can't recommend Chromecast to other buyers.<br /><br />Chromecast is not ready for prime time. It works well for what it does, but doesn't do much.  You have to subscribe to premium services or buy content to use it.  Your only free choices are casting YouTube or a Chrome tab.  But Chrome tab content casting only works on laptops and desktops.  It does not integrate with Chrome for Android!!!  If you want to buy it to use with your Android smart phone --- DON'T because for the most part, you won't!  You can't cast any of the pictures or videos you took unless you upload them to YouTube first.  Wait until there are many 3rd party apps available that actually work.  Or maybe wait until Chrome for Android is able to cast.  That will give you some minimal functionality that's reasonably convenient.  Otherwise, you will have to set your laptop up in your TV room.<br /><br />Some have dubbed Chromecast the &#34;Chromecasket.&#34;  That's a good name.
0553382179|5.0|The book was in good condition, arrived in a timely manner and is enjoyable. I had already read part of the book from the library, but decided I really needed a copy of my own. Hopefully sometime soon my chaos will start to subside.
B00005JLK1|4.0|This is a great movie to watch for Halloween.  I had this movie on vhs and I know not a lot of people use vcr's anymore, so I upgraded to a dvd and I'm happy.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved the movie, superheroes cannot get better than this. Cannot wait for the next part to come out and hope it keeps getting better and not the other way around.
B001F12J0C|4.0|I bought this set for my sister because she loves these movies.  It was great to buy them all together instead of having to by them separately, half because of the price and half because you don't have to wait for another to arrive.
031623480X|5.0|Well written, easy to understand, and has a lot of easy to follow recipes at the end of the book.  Definitely worth the time to read.
B00DD49R0E|1.0|If you are thinking of watching this movie and having your kids see it just look at the rainbow in the picture on the title. With that said just google the rainbow and make your own decision. Your kids are a young age and you should watch very carefully what they watch.
B00338QENI|3.0|The deeply moving, artfully told tragedy and miracle of Henrietta Lacks is a must read for those concerned with medical research ethics and those interested in a well told story that involves racial justice. Its only drawback is the author's penchant for conflating her story as investigator, novelist, and woman of privelege, as something that deserves to be told alongside the story of Ms. Lacks and her family, who are the true heroes.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The Signature of All Things - Elizabeth Gilbert<br />Audio performance by J. Stevenson<br />5 stars<br /><br />Alma Whittaker was a respected 19th century bryologist; she published several definitive texts on the study of mosses. Her father was Henry Whittaker, a famously successful botanical explorer. Her mother was the intelligent, multi-lingual, Beatrix van Devender, herself the daughter of a famous botanical family. And after spending 500 pages with Alma Whittaker, I find it difficult to believe that she is a completely fictional character.<br /><br />While Alma spends much of her life in the intense study of mosses, Elizabeth Gilbert has written an intense study of Alma; her unconventional childhood, her intellectual growth, her secret, sexual obsessions and her total lack of preparation for `normal' relationships. As Alma grows up with the century, she maintains a narcissistic, self absorption that leaves her detached from the emotional pain of those closest to her and from the political turmoil of an increasingly divided United States. Alma's eccentric upbringing condemns her to years of excruciating loneliness and leaves her vulnerable in her few experiences of true friendship. Alma is fascinated by moss. I am fascinated with Alma.<br /><br />So, here are 500 pages of Alma grappling with pain in her personal life and puzzles in her intellectual life. And then, toward the end of the century, and toward the end of Alma's life, there is Darwin and his,The Origin of Species. All of the personal pain and the intellectual puzzles of Alma's life interact with Darwin's theory, her theory, and Alfred Russell Wallace's theory. She chases down every significant truth and each confounding question raised by Darwin's theory and her own research. She could walk right out of the pages of the book and take part in the debate as it continues today.<br /><br />Alma was a 19th century bryologist. She is as real to me as any of the historical figures that appear in this book.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This book started out with a bang and just kept going. Very hard to put down. Baldacci is quickly becoming my favorite author.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|A compelling, but overly long book.  That said, I couldn't put it down.  It seems that the authors message concerns the imortality
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game I just love it. I play it every day and night do not watch T.V much, Candy crush make me happy.<br /><br /> M.C.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun and addicting.  But after you reach the 35th level, you are expected to pay to open more levels.  Not happy about that.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|so I played the game until level 16 and then all of a sudden it kept taking 5 minutes to load. Before that I loved the game but now when I try to go on it says connection error or it loads but just shuts down the app and deleted everything!!!! If you fix this ill give you 5 stars and tell everyone to by this app.just fix the problem!!!! I'm so mad right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003Q6D2B4|1.0|This is the worst movie I have seen in years. Not at all up to Willis' standard. It was so bad I could not watch this in its<br />entirety. I pity the poor soul who buys it from the thrift store to which I donated this.
B00CWX1HPA|5.0|It's Classic Movie that everyone must have for there collection. Even not putting more of old 1978 cast into the mix left some good one out. thank you Don
B000002O7C|4.0|Not the best music ever but has many good highlights. This is a &#34;buy&#34; in my opinion. I really enjoy listening to this.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|It's fun to watch simple movie and what the Idiot at DreamWorks could do with the Penguins of Madagascar make more dvd. I'm waiting.
B00B5SJEOO|5.0|This is the best score ever made. I love the opera! Music is simply WOW when you turn the volume way up.
0446699616|5.0|Wonderful writer, His lenguaje and expresions are so clear, son neat.,,and Y adore his sense of humour, Its evident that he studies deeply  the story, habits, culture of every place and scenarios of his works.
0316322407|5.0|I look forward to enjoying this wonderful story, my daughter will be inspired. Excellent product as well. Very excellent product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|To me I think it is a very entertaining game and I would let my kids play this game it is much like having a real horse
B00F880BWG|4.0|the walking dead is my favorite season and since i have been watching the show, i stopped watching other shows.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Really great GPU for the price. It handles most of the games I play on Ultra with no problems. Paired with a AMD 8350 FX and some 2400MHZ G-skill Trident x ram, it's a pleasure cruise!
B00007KQKM|4.0|Unless you have seen other European versions of this great piece of literature, you would possibly say it is excellent.  The actors and actresses do a yeoman's job.  However, compared to other versions it is, to this viewer, very 'PG&#34; in nature.  Perhaps the director was loathe to deal with Amer. rating systems so the final 'cut' ends up losing much of the richness and authenticity which this reviewer believes the novel's writer intended for his audience.  Good movie. . if its the only version you have ever watched and/or a bit of nudity and 'reality' in the bedroom offend you.  But then, to each his own.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great video quality. Very pleased with my purchase. Can't wait for next episode! Very iPad friendly download. Would recommend to all!
B003VS0CX8|3.0|The Blu ray disc didn't work in my Blu ray player. The DVD worked fine and we loved the movie
0061978078|5.0|Fantastic.  I avoided too long because I purchased by mistake ... I got it and it had rave reviews and &#34;young adult&#34; (I am a senior citizen).  When I was out of things to read, I read it.  And then bought every book I could find from this author -- all great.  Young adult means not too much violence, gratuitous sex, etc. -- maybe it should say young adult and senior citizens :-)
B0015AARJI|3.0|Decent controller.  It's about what you should expect.  Wireless is quite nice.  Very different than the NES controllers I grew up with :-)
B00BAXFECK|5.0|So much has already been said about this book, I don't want to be repetitive. It's been years since I was so excited about a book. It took my breath away at several points.<br />Here's one thing I do want to say: I hesitated over getting this because I was not interested in the thoughts/actions of a young teen-age boy, as written by a young woman. I thought it would either be fakey (becasue the author is an older-than-him woman) or boring, because what 13-year-old is that interesting?<br />I was so wrong on all points. His voice sounds realistic, and he's realistically sophisticated enough to be interesting---especially given all the other characters, and locations.<br />This is a truly stunning, in the best way possible, novel. It's literary, AND readable; it's kept me up at night.<br />If anyone is thinking wrongly like I did about the main character, don't make that mistake. It's inceredibly good.
B0093LINT2|5.0|Amazing little machine.  Make sure you pick of up all of the required accessories.  mSATA wifi and hard drive, and very importantly the power cord.  Kind of cheesy, but it doesn't come with the power cord.  It's a bit anti-climatic when you receive your exciting, shiny new computer, but you can't plug it in.  Dead silent, which is exactly what I wanted.  Everything works perfectly in Ubuntu.  I bought two more.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|Well, it was a quip-filled shoot-em-up-blow-em-up.  Enjoyable for what it was; however, nothing that I would go out of my way to watch again.  Actually preferred 'Olympus Has Fallen' to this one.  WHD had the bigger budget and it shows; however, for all of the special effects, etc, it was full of plot holes and was just plain 'ordinary'.  Nothing new here at all, and that's what disappointed me.  Was hoping for something other than a generic quip-filled movie and didn't get it.  Acting was OK; however, again, seems that they were just acting around a bunch of special effects.  IMHO, nothing more than just a movie to kill time, and then forget.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Great Animation but not as funny as the first.  I think a little more character involvement is needed and less about Mike.
B005LW5J9O|2.0|This book just wasn't my cup of tea. Although it was my book club's monthly choice I guess it's just one person's idea or perception of what he envisioned during a near death experience (NED). I never had such an experience although unconscious for 16 days following an auto accident. Mind you, I'm not saying that because I didn't have one it's all nonsense. Rather it's one person's NED experience recorded.<br />I stopped reading The Swerve about 1/3 of the way through and switched to John Mauldin's Code Red which is outstanding!!
B005FMZVLQ|2.0|the cloth strap is damage to the second day, is a  very poor strap quality, but the machinary is ok
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book was mostly run-of-the-mill Grisham, except for the twist with the family of a boy the lawyer in the story tried to help.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a very addictive game.  Loads of fun.  Challenging for sure.  Don't like that I have to pay for extra lives.
B00FKTDKTO|3.0|The ageless Macca manages to stay relevant with this nice outing. Alligator, Get Me Out of Here (with the surprise twist), Everybody Out There, Early Days, Hosanna, Looking at Her, Turned Out, On My Way to Work and Queenie Eye are all very good cuts receiving a lot of play on my iPhone. Well done, Sir Paul.
0062255657|5.0|Excellent read! Very well done. Neil never disappoints! I have all his novels and will buy every one that he writes.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Compelling tale of life in India, from slums to wealthy neighborhoods.  Especially about the difficulties of motherhood & also the joys of raising children. Focus is on mother love & how females are looked upon.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|And yet another book that scared me so much that I couldn't put it down. Yes, that's what a Stephen King book does EVERY time, and has for over 25 years. I'm glad the stubborn part of me kept me from reading The Shining for all these years. When I saw that Doctor Sleep was the sequel, I decided that I needed to read The Shining at last. I have been in a continuous state of fear and yet unable to put the books down as I read from the beginning of one to the ending of the other. Thank you Stephen King.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Reading through this book, I always fely a sense of adventure and action.  If I could give this book more than five stars then I would.  I also like the fact that there was always a feeling of suspense and each chapter left you wondering &#34;what are they going to do next?&#34;
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I find the show is a good tie in to the marvel movies and comics Reminds me of the the marvel comic book series Nick Fury Agent of S.H.E.I.L.D.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The first thing I would like to comment on is that I loved how Rick Riordan split the story in half and got to focuse on Annabeth and what she was thinking.  When I say this, I din't mean about how the author makes different chapters based on different charicters ( though I do like that to).  The other thing I like about this book is that it has a great cliffhanger ending!
1250038820|5.0|why i love brandon ?  because  he gives you a picture a  few words  synthesis  understanding  feeling .<br />better than a long novel .<br />i like it very much. thanks.<br />:-)
B0053TMP24|5.0|Because I read the first book, I thought that it would be simmaler, I was completely wrong.  This book threw a twist into Percy Jackson and I never thought of him in the same way.  This book was a wonderful continuation of the first book, The Lost Hero, just like all Rick Riordan books!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Can no longer play slot rooms every time I get scatter game freezes and I can not exit slot room have to uninstall &amp; reinstall app, plus some items are so rare in seasonal rooms it closes before room can be completed . I use to really enjoy playing but not anymore. Customer support never responds to issues.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Very Satisfied!  This is an engaging, wide ranging series, vast in scope and full of detailed character development - No surprise it's a major hit!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun my son who is five loves trying out the game. It's one game everyone can play and enjoy.
3836538725|5.0|I visited the exhibition at the natural history museum in London and was stunned by the photographs. The book does the pictures justice and conveys a rare and beautiful aesthetic. A highly recommended purchase, and a highly recommended exhibition.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Keeps me occupied but some times it takes too long to get out of a level and this is frustrating.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great game,  love it it keeps u thinking.  its fast paced and keeps your mind going and its good hand eye coordination.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I definitely would always buy the headset with the charging case. It keeps the bluetooth well charged while I'm driving and not using it and it allows me to throw my bluetooth piece in my travel bags without worrying if it'll get crushed since it's inside the case. It's pretty durable and overall quality manufacturing.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|awaome<br />the game is very cool so all of the diffret cars<br />the differ thinng you can do tote for the fifteenth tracks
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved Eat, Love Pray! However this book is nothing like it but still wonderful and gripping.  It follows the life of a wealthy girl who develops a passion for botany and evolves in character and spirit throughout her life.  The characters are rich and we follow the development of friends and family over a period of years.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this show, interesting, intelligent and amazingly...barely any sex, violence or profanity!!! How can it be that we could like a show without them...Well....great writing, acting and production!  Sound tracks are awesome as well!  TV for intelligent grown ups!!!
B007BVMVDU|3.0|I read all of the books and admit they are violent.  However I thought it was unfortunate that the video choose to in my opinion over exploit the violence with large doses of gore, nudity, and  brutal sexual scenes.  In some cases the brutality was simply a background to a dialogue to add visual interest - it was irrelevant to the plot.  The episodes seem fairly faithful to the book plot and the characters are well acted.  However the graphic realism could have been reduced to have resulted in a better production as the story is quite engaging.
1442366621|3.0|This is a good program and well done CD but reference is made to a pdf filled with diet information and I could not for the life of me figure out how to download it.  I tried emailing the publisher with no sucess.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great mix of romance (for girls) and battle (for boys)! Perfect for young teens everywhere. Thank you Suzanne Collins!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A movie containing zombies is judged in not in comparison with all other movies, but by its ability to hold up amidst a stack of zombie classics. World War Z does this well, and certainly (at least) deserves its place at the table, but will probably fade with time. Entertaining, exciting, terrifying at times. Well worth a watch.
0553801473|5.0|ok
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|Kindle only? Why? Why? Why? Why can't this app run on an Android phone (like every other version of Terraria?) Guess I should have waited or heaven forbid - bought it elsewhere. Please update this app, Amazon.
B00122KW0I|1.0|All they need to do is include the most popular songs from every movie but instead they include lots of little interludes that are unrecognizable.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I love the original game and after beating it, I always longed for more kingdom rush. This is a great sequel. The Dane old formula is here,so it's easy to pick up but the enemies and new towers add to the challenge,the varied heroes are a nice touch.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it especially how u can grow into bigger sharks and all the extras powers u can buy
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|It's fairly cute and a good set-up for the original movie, but overall I wouldn't watch it again. Yes, the characters learn to work as a team, embrace who they are and capabilities as monsters, and Sully/Mike &#34;grow-up&#34; but it doesn't compare to other Pixar movies that really have an emotional punch like Up, Toy Story, and Wall-E. See it once, don't buy it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Exciting and very different.  The author creates a whole world, very detailed and filled with interesting characters.  It is somewhat of a difficult read. Pay close attention!!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|A very fun numbers puzzle game! A cross between Sudoku and cross-word puzzles with different levels of difficulty, this game will occupy you for hours!
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should really get this app I can't stop playing it!! You will love this app. There are zombies/spiders /creepers/skeleton s
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the series.  Good drama, lovely cinematography, interesting characters.  And I love a show that can make me laugh!
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|One of Robert's best performances as a tough guy.  &#34;What is the color of the boathouse in Hereford?&#34;  All the acting is good.  Though the part is small, Sean Bean as a &#34;ronin&#34; in over his head is very well done,.  What really gives this the five star rating is the chase scene, one of the best ones I've seen onscreen.  If you're looking for an action movie with intrigue, this is it.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Thin characters and plot, this is pretty typical science fiction with a thin veneer of political thinking.  The message seems to be that nobody brilliant enough to win a war could (also) be cruel enough to do what is necessary to win the war... a premise that seems to have been disproved many times in history!  I read it because it was praised by many adult IT professionals and because the movie was coming out.  It is not bad but I will skip the movie and sequels.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't usually write reviews; however, this game is so worth one! Excellent game with fantastic graphics. Although slow to load, ran fine on my kindle fire. Thanks Fireproof Games. Hope you will expand on it.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Excellent show!!  Great cast of characters.  Very well written with good plots and story lines.  I would highly recommend it.
B00ECJ18HO|5.0|Very nice illustrations, decent formatting - what else do you need to enjoy good classic book... I downloaded several &#34;The Hound of the Baskervilles&#34; editions, this one is the best.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|.Cute I get to live the ice age movie. It's fun and I can't wait to see what new characters I'll meet.
B00371QQ2U|4.0|The movie, of course, is excellent, the extras are fun BUT I am just fuming mad that I have to forward through an xfinity commercial (and more) EVERY TIME I WANT TO SEE THIS without a top menu option or fast play option.<br /><br />You guys wonder why people rip Blurays and DVDS?  THERE IS YOUR ANSWER.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. If your a horse lover you will LOVE this game. I hope they make a second one
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Tuesdays gets FIVE stars. Human connection and soul sharing is powerful. A must read for all ages. Get It Now
B00BHMEALA|5.0|It can be difficult for the average person to really understand history, unless you fictionalize some tiny detail and then pull back to see what else was going on.  To some degree, that's the benefit of a film like Argo - it tells a great story, in the context of a recent event, and leaves you with some insight into what actually happened around it.  Ben Affleck is great as Tony Mendez, the CIA extraction specialist with nerves of steel.  Bryan Cranston is also excellent as his mercurial boss, but his Hollywood allies, played by Alan Arkin and John Goodman, make this improbable story believable.  Definitely the Best Picture of 2012.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's a pretty accurate recreation of the original game (as it should be in this day and age), but the onscreen control is abysmal. This is not a condemnation of the game or the Kindle; I just feel that these type of twitchy games need a physical control.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Fast zombies that behave more like supersonic ants, and a lot more exterior and long shots than you typically see in a zombie film.  Overall, very interesting, and mostly well-executed.  But not exactly a classic of the genre.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My middle son loves Angry Birds Star Wars...so this game was a must-have as soon as it was released.  He plays it every day on my cell phone, and will be playing every day on his new tablet!  It's fun, and it requires some logic and planning, which I like--it's not educational per se, but at least it doesn't involve killing people (just pigs:).<br /><br />I just purchased the telepods, which he is anxiously awaiting, so I will update this review with information about how they work at a later date.  :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book....started off slow, but really picked up in the middle. The book makes you want to jump into the pages and shake the mess out of both of them, that's how wicked it is. Disappointed by the ending, but overall. I loved it
B003UBTX6S|1.0|Did not like it at all.  I did not care what happened to the characters...I just had no interest.  Sorry. I know others rated it highly, but I truly do not understand the appeal of this book. The plot line showed great promise, but the author didn't really reel me in.  Deleted off Kindle.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a fantastic App!  My baby fell right asleep as soon as he heard these soothing sounds.  Love it!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I absolutely loved this book--I wanted to read it before seeing the movie, and I am so glad I did.  I was completely blown away by all the twists and turns--the book was truly a roller coaster ride of excitement and nail-biting!  The writing was easy to follow and there was a wide range use of vocabulary.  However, it was not verbose.  Very well done.  Highly recommended.  Only downer is that once it is read, it really has no &#34;re-read&#34; value, as you already know how it ends.  Then again, I take that back, because I just reread it after several years, because I had forgotten most of the story.  Regardless, it's a great book!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This app is lots of fun. The 2D orbital physics are quite good. The controls are easy to use yet complex enough to be useful. The rocket building is simple yet flexible. Very good game!
0743270754|5.0|We need his kind of genius in the White House.  Smart enough to rally his enemies, learn from them, and find a workable balance.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I've been trying to play. I've spend around 20 bucks on this game. When I go to play it my reef is empty and it says enter reef Id. Then it says server is down. All of my other games are working just fine. Help!!!  I better have not lost all my purchases
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I have some work to do, now. To confirm some of what is suggested in this book. It's not that I doubt his information, but I need to re-read some of the content, I have a nagging feeling there is too much here that is interpretation rather than &#34;information.&#34; But maybe that's Galdwell's genius, his ability to interpret and process what others don't recognize?
B007SGM084|3.0|I really can't see what all the fuss was about. Average writing, completely predictable plot. The sex was even so so due to the writing? I wish I would have passed, especially for the price I paid.
B00DUL3VFM|5.0|This is what started the whole stargate universe, loved them all.  Have always enjoyed Kurt Russell from his Disney good kid roles to his bad ass roles today
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book. Pleasant reading and I like the definitions of the flowers. I still make references to the definitions of the flowers.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Love love love these movies.  Sure, I might be too old, but I think it speaks a lot about a movie when younger kids can enjoy watching it along with you, while you dont have to worry about graphic or inappropriate content.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|One of the few high-res games that actually work on my Kindle Fire (Iron Man and Despicable Me: Minion Rush constantly freeze up the whole device).  Kids seem to like it.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|So far this album is enjoyable.  I often buy albums, but only end up liking a few songs.  Most of the songs on this album stay true to Adele's form, and therefore are enjoyable.  I really enjoy loveson, which is a remake of a classic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|i thought this season would be predictable but it had some big surprises! i never thought i could like it more but it just keeps getting better. :)
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Love love love these movies.  Sure, I might be too old, but I think it speaks a lot about a movie when younger kids can enjoy watching it along with you, while you dont have to worry about graphic or inappropriate content.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|This movie is a great classic with wonderful songs and an excellent story. Love how the film is more vibrant than the original one from the VHS days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great book and story collection for young readers.  I bought this book and gave it to my niece.  Not only does she enjoy the plot, but Katniss (the main character) is a great role model.  Especially when you consider these books in relation to the movies.  My niece who is 12, is constantly talking about Celebrities like Selena Gomez, Taylor swift, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Lawerence, I'm happy to say that both Katniss and Jennifer Lawrenece have attributes that I hope she picks up.<br /><br />Great plot line and character development.  This book gets much more into the emotional aspect of Katniss's and Peeta's relationship, while also including some Gale in there as well.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I never, never, ever should read the bad reviews of a book before reading it.  It's not about those reviews that give away the ending, it is about the people who haven't a clue what they've just read.  No wonder there are so few bad reviews for The Art of Racing in the Rain.  This is amazing.  Someone compared it to The Five People You Meet in Heaven, and I agree insofar as it moved me completely and viscerally.  The book begins at Enzo's end.  it is no secret once you read page two on the Kindle, so people aren't giving away a big secret.  But the love Enzo has, in a strangely anthropomorphic, yet simple canine way is heartwrenching.  The sadness in this book exists in some people's lives; that is life.  Cancer, death, heartaches and more.  To feel it from the dog's perspective was eyeopening.  I will never, ever, look at my dogs again the same way.  I would say buy this at full price, but at $2.99 for the Kindle, or even $14+ for a hardcover, it is worthy and beautiful.  Congrats to Garth Stein!  Perhaps you believe in reincarnation?  I think you know Enzo's heart too well...

Wished there would be another release.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|Love love love this movie! Never laughted so hard. I have watched it five times already and never get bored of it!!
B0029NY9YO|2.0|This movie was hard to stay into.  Almost too much going on, and didn't really captivate me or catch my attention.  I got it on sale, but I still wouldnt purchase it again.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is much improved from Book 4.  It brings back beloved characters and interesting twists. Can't wait for Book 6
B003K15IF8|4.0|Fascinating topic for author John Williams. The protagonist (Stoner) is an amazingly ordinary boy and then man, living in decades that saw very rapid changes within the dominant American culture. Through it all, Stoner seems unable to adjust to the changing times... or perhaps he was just oblivious, while focused so intently on his individual life (mostly, his career). In one sense, however, Stoner is a character who can open the eyes of readers who are even moderately comfortable in their own thoughts and actions. There are people like Stoner in our society-- people who simply cannot bring themselves to express what they feel. We all know people who are so painfully shy that they only show energy and confidence in a particular area of expertise-- whether that is basketball  teams or European Renaissance literature. But in Williams's book, we get to see more of the interior thoughts and feelings of such a person.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Just finished another masterpiece by Grisham.  There were times I could not put it down. Great read! The historical perspective was filled with great detail.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|E books flawless. The story was a bit repeative. Not quite what I expected from all the movie hype. Not sure I would see the movie after reading the book.
0446547638|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books, they let me go somewhere else for awhile...great story lines and people...leave you wanting more!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Fantastic show. Well casted. Great acting. Pertinent to today's society. My wife and I Can't get enough of this show
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it,  works well in Canada,  be careful of your data usage,  averaging over 200G/month with the whole family watching Netflix on 5 different devices.  Thank you for unlimited usage Videotron!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|challenging and totally addicting! this game has taken over my life! lol! i cannot believe i waited this long to try this game.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|My son got me addicted to this show during it's 4th season. I caught up to the current show in just a month.<br /><br />This series is so good, it made me almost want to do Meth.<br /><br />ALMOST.
B001P06GX4|5.0|A great game that the whole family loves! Easy to follow rules and bright colors make it a hit with the kids.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Blu Ray works great, and the price made the sale. The kids love the show and want to watch it again and again. Now any building with a dome is Monster's University. Helen Mirren does an outstanding job as Dean Hardscrabble.
B007REV4T8|1.0|With all the hype surrounding this movie, I'm glad it showed up for free on my Kindle and that I didn't buy it. It's a Bond movie yes, but it lacks a certain Bond magic I can't put my finger on. This movie is very dark and gloomy. Craig's first 2 were more Bond-like. The whole intro chase lasts almost 15 min, of the usual jumping, chasing, crashing and fighting. Big deal. Seen it all before. A new \\"Q\\" that's a unkempt geeky kid?? No way. No thanks. Not buying it. I guess he will be in every movie from here on out. I've been a Bond fan since the 70's. This movie doesn't have it. I didn't care for the down and out Bond. That's no Bond I ever knew. Craig's first 2 movies were better, I prefer the cleaned up, nicely clothed, sharp witted, well armed Bond to this unshaven, drinking, lost version. I'll pass on this. No thanks...
1423113462|5.0|My grandson loved this book from the first chapter until the final period.  It is such a unique way to write about mythical heroes that it seems much more modern than ancient to the child.  Gripping themes to the end.  Can't wait for him to read the next volume.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|All the haters can shut up. Having been a die-hard Gaga fan for years, I can appreciate her music on a whole other level. Having said that, I can also be critical when necessary. I was not the biggest fan of Born This Way, and some of the songs on this album are not my absolute favorites. The beginning of Venus makes me want to stab someone. However, overall, the album is nicely mixed and the tracks play seamlessly together so don't skip around on random. If I had one wish for an album of Gaga's it would be for her to have one of just piano ballads. I can keep dreaming though.
125000098X|5.0|Great book from any source! The content was more important than the method use to purchase the book. The delivery was on time and the condition was excellent.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Always loved the Bridget Jones books.  Was so glad she wrote another.  Enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend to all.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's pretty dope awesome gameplay.also so many dif weapons plus all the classes only online game can't forget each class has its own weapons
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|Not nearly as funny as the first two Hangovers. Funniest part was the scene after the credits started rolling. Due to that scene looking forward to next Hangover!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Ok for the people that read reviews and think it's the creator trying to promote his/her product.....I promise it's not. I downloaded this game last night and have been glued to it since. It's addicting and the graphics are far ahead of its time. I am still in awe of how great this game looks. It's ridiculous and you need to play it!
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Good Book I used it for my class an I received an A will buy more books when needed. Thanks
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love mahjong and the quality of the game is good. This one keeps me entertained longer then the one on the computer cause it's a little more challenging but I enjoy challenging
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows. I dont even watch that much TV. It s not really about the zombies but mostly about human evolution in destitute times.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|If God wants you to be more abundant, then it will be.<br />Relax and be thankful for what you have.<br />Don't waste your time and money, look you are already manifesting<br />abundance. Love, Learn, and laugh.
0596101996|5.0|As a relatively new Javascript developer, I use this book a lot! It is a solid reference that I use daily. It is a lengthy reference, however the topic warrants the length. This book does not contain a lot of &#34;fluff&#34;, it drills down to the core features of the language and how to apply them in your programs. A must have for any serious Javascript developer!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What I think of this is that every ppl love this game so Avery one should download this games and pass every level but let me tell you something the levels are hard 2 enjoy

B000008JUM|5.0|had this year's ago on tape needed to get it as CD - love Cole Porter and all the artists
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Not one story disappointed!<br />Alice Munro has paid deep dear attention to life and articulates this in the dearest way!
B008Y6RGFE|5.0|Very comical, heart warming, easy to watch.  I loved how will smith taught people with no self confidence to find love with beautiful woman!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Anyone who reads this book will have an even higher appreciation for our soldiers and especially those in special forces. It is so hard to put ones self in the atmosphere of this soldier and think how he never gave up. Read it!
B005NACYQU|2.0|How do &#34;people&#34; who are into extreme violence, cannibalism, human sacrifice, etc become the &#34;good guys&#34;?  And a bit of modernity is &#34;bad&#34;?  The story is very basic - good vs bad, but boy, it takes a long time to get there, in an incredibly complicated and convoluted way.  I bought this book because it was on the BBC World Book Club and got rave reviews.  It was my first Neil Gaiman book, and it is surely my last Neil Gaiman book.  However, I am obviously in the minority as he won the Most Wanted Author award.  All a matter of taste!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game. Although it seems that sometimes the rules change. That said,  it's still my go to game.
0805047905|5.0|This book was read many times over with my daughters when they were young. They are now in college! I purchased this book as gifts for the new born babies that have entered this world and multiplied our family.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Great believable flow to the plot line. It is a very entertaining movie and well worth the time. Solid acting
0694003611|5.0|I've been reading this book to children since it was first published. It is one of the most innovative and creative ways to illustrate and tell a story. Each colored page changes with movement in many ways. All you have to do is just pay attention and have lots of fun with your children! The black and white pages in-between the colored illustrations have been documented that these illustrations stimulate the brain in a positive way. I purchased this book as gifts for the new born babies that have entered this world and multiplied our family.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|So damn predictable and cliche ridden !!  Just 1 buff guy and lots of shooting  ! Forgot what the plot line was after the midpoint
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I like the Beach Boys sound from the 60s and 70s.  This CD is filled with the classic Beach Boys harmonies format of 'old' applied to new songs.  New songs in better quality audio format than records or tapes, but with the classic Beach Boys characteristic vocals.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Fell in love with the characters.  Most books paint people with the same brush but in this book you can see and understand why they behaved differently during these troubled times.  Peer pressure is very strong  --  with the children -- with the country.  Sad but enlightening story.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|King retreads some old ground hoping to find something new.  It just runs out of gas after awhile.  Not sure what the fuss is about this except people are more prone to applaud King because he is still writing.  This is past prime King and has nothing really promising to add to the cannon or the story of Danny Torrance.  Matter of fact, there is a plot twist that is right out of the most cliched soap operas.  It was so ham handed and just bland.  I thought, \\"Really?\\" The Villains are not very capable of producing much of a scare and seem almost comically inept.  There is little menace or real fear as in the original Shining. The biggest fear in The Shining was not so much the ghosts in the Overlook but the spectre of losing control, alcoholism and the barely contained rage that Jack Torrance felt playing tug of war with his soul coupled with economic hardships and the possible dissolution of marriage.  The ghost of failure and never being good enough.  Add some ghosts and a spooky hotel in an isolated place surrounded by snow and you have something there.  Here--it is psychic vampires lifted from Carrion Comfort driving in Winnebagos.  Danny's Adult Angst here is just some cliches lifted from the AA Blue Book.  The rest is pretty random.  Don't get me wrong--King has a way with words--it is that the Horror Field is well worn with cliches and gimmicks that have been done better somewhere else.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this but it was hard for me to understand the maneuvers that were going on.  The author was very good in switching from the war games to the personalities of the various characters so I didn't get bored.  Would like to compare to the movie.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|This is a movie with a lot of style. Plot is very classical, but the costumes, the characters are fantastic.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I loved this book!!  First, it was fascinating and humorous that anyone would think and act the way that Don did.  The relationship was so interesting to watch.  It was also amazing that Don could make any changes with the problems that he dealth with and was willing to try.  Great read!
B008JFUNJQ|4.0|I am reviewing the film \\"Ender's Game\\" based on the film itself (as a film overall) and not in comparison to the incredibly renowned original Orson Scott Card book of the same name. With that said, Director and adaptor of the screenplay Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Rendition) did a really artistic and thought evoking job of telling the story of a gifted young boy who is persecuted because of his size, intelligence and ability to win at everything he tries.<br /><br />In this film there is a back-story of aliens, once again, after having attacked Earth in the past and for whatever reason left our planet in a wake of destruction and chaos. Years later the military expects their immanent return and as a result, are training qualified young people to do battle in a highly sophisticated and technological manner.<br /><br />With a really talented and experienced cast, like Harrison Ford (Mosquito Coast, Witness) as Colonel Graff, who is the man who first sees in one boy, a person who may stand above the crowd both intellectually and strategically for the cause. Graff is a trainer of young people in the art of war, combat and strategy. Harrison gives a real gritty hard-nosed performance that almost at times makes you dislike his combative and Napoleon-like way of commanding his trainees.<br /><br />Stepping up to the plate rather impressively is Asa Butterfield (Hugo, The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas) playing Ender Wiggin, who has this impressive intensity in his eyes and an incredible conviction to his character with his performance. Asa is sharp and alert to watch and does the overcoming of his peers very well. It's unfortunate his end mission isn't what he thought it was and as a result makes good on something that was completely out of his hands.<br /><br />Sir Ben Kingsley (Schindler's List, Hugo) plays Mazer Rackham, the legendary fighter of all who actually defeated the aliens, the only one to defeat the aliens in an all-out attack. Coupled with his strangely bizarre tattoo make-up, Ben give a sharp, `Master Yoda'-like performance who has a mission of only training the best of the best. Like Ender.<br /><br />Special note must go to Viola Davis for playing the cunning and sharp Major Gwen Anderson who keeps trying to keep Harrison from over zealously over-training these young people into their own deaths. Viola's chemistry and opposite thinking against Harrison makes for some nice conflict scenes together.<br /><br />The film has some wonderful visual effects and the sequences in the ant-gravity training sphere above Earth are stunning to watch. The aliens are also a twist on the insect looking type that are actually not as they appear to be perceived by humans.<br /><br />The film for me left a really good message in my head about how young people, when they see this film, can realize that peer pressure, your extraordinary or ordinary gifts are never something to be ashamed of. This film is a positive message about young people or the underdogs who win on their wits, intelligence and cunning. \\"Ender's Game\\", besides being a Sci-Fi visual delight to look at, at the heart of it, tells a real story of courage and hope. Again, the book is far more intense and detailed, but this as a separate film holds up with a good story and characters. A really good film on many levels, with a positive outlook on humanity and how prejudice is not always found on our planet.y bizarre tattoo make-up, Ben give a sharp, `Master Yoda'-like performance who has a mission of only training the best of the best.

0810979772|5.0|So fun to add this to the series of books he already has. Product arrived quick and perfect condition...He loves it
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great headphones. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I these are the best heaphones I've ever own, super comfortable, amazing sound. My son is almost 9 months, so I will sit across the hall watching movies or playing video games during my &#34;shift&#34;, I can wear these for hours at a time and the sound quality is great.<br /><br />PS my favorite use is wearing them while watching UFC events on the computer, you can hear the corners yelling indiviual instructions very clearly
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!!  Really enjoyed the twists and turns! If you are looking for a good book this it.  Gillian Flynn does a great job of keeping you on your toes throughouth the book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|looks like you are going to play anyway...don't say I didn't warn ya...after awhile its pretty hard to complete levels without spending real money...hut its soo fun! plus..playing from a mobile device is different than playing on a computer...there are perks on a computer and better graphics
B001KQKD50|5.0|Love this album! Even from the opening track of The Musical Box, to the last track The Fountain of Salamacis Nursey Cryme speaks volumes! Seven Stones, is a great song since it uses the exact same mellotron Tony Banks bought from Ian McDonald from [[ASIN:B00065MDRW In the Court of the Crimson King]] Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins also played on [[ASIN:B000F8O7T2 Colin Scot]]'s album in 1971. So much teamwork went into making this album along with Anthony Phillips who co wrote The Musical Box!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book. Gave a lot of insight to the characters and solidified the movie of the same. The book layout and story telling was first rate!
B00197U0DU|5.0|Not a bad album. There are some great moments here, while Genesis was putting together this album in 1969 Phil Collins was in a band called Flaming Youth that put out the album  [[ASIN:B004SB156U Ark 2]] while Steve Hackett was in a band called Quiet World that put out the album [[ASIN:B000025AIE Road]]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun game to play. You can't get fat from all the sweet stuff fine that game. Hope people like as much as I do
B0043XUXS4|5.0|While the trio formerly known as \\"Genesis\\" was wasting time with Duke, Peter Gabriel knew how much better and versital Phil Collins was behind the drums than as a silly pop writter making garbage songs like Misunderstanding(a song Phil stole)There are some great drumming moments here, Intruder(Phil actually invented the gated drumming here) No Self Control, Biko, and Family Snapshot. Yes there were a few hits on this album however don't let that steer you away from the other songs. This album is positive proof that all Genesis members former or current were far better as solo acts than dragging away with the remaining trio formerly known as \\"Genesis\\"!
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|The Tab for Gmail works, but is kind of clumsy. Overall, it is satisfactory. Most of the apps work fine.
B000F3A7LO|5.0|There were many talented artists on this album including from Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. North Star, and Disengage were songs Phil Collins drummed to while Peter Gabriel sang Here Comes the Flood and hear Peter talking in Preface. There is a Peter Gabriel version of Exposure of his [[ASIN:B0043XUZLE Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch (Remastered)]] album released a year earlier.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Easy access to both sides of case.  Built in slots for desktop HDD's and laptop HDD's.<br />Material is a little on the thin side but overall would buy this case again.  Excited to build my new desktop this weekend!
B0084BMUFA|3.0|I hesitate to put a review on anything unless I put five stars. It's my opinion and therefore, I think reviews should be considered as one person's opinion. Others, however, have attacked me personally if I don't like something they loved. I've been accused of bringing the rating down (I don't understand why that matters) and told that I don't know what I'm talking about. Therefore, I'm giving it a three, although I don't recommend it and would never read it again, if I did have my Kindle. I like the classics but I confess, I didn't finish this one. I returned my Kindle. Having read the story before, I was never overwhelmed. I barely remember it from school (and I was a librarian so I'm sure I read it more than once). I watched the movie with George C. Scott before attempting to read it again. The movie was so good and moved at a much quicker pace. Perhaps I should have re-read the book before watching the movie but I've been spoiled now. If you're a fan of the movie and expect to find it in this story, you will be disappointed. Even for a classic, it's rather slow.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|At first, I was drawn in by the style of the graphics and gameplay. Then as I played more and more, the game seemed very well balanced for a mobile game. It's basically what it looks like, the gameplay is fun, and as you level up, instead of getting the best gun, there really is no best one; which makes it more challenging to fight the bosses instead of getting bored of it once you get the best weapon. Also. it may seem sort of difficult to get moneybut I found it easiest to keep beating the turtle boss over and over again. If you go to the far left side, then its mortars can't hit you and you will be able to kill it easily. Hope this review helped!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A little slow in beginning but became the page turner that he normally writes. I liked it enough to buy the sequel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad I can play Candy Crush on Kindle. It starts off easy gets harder as you climb the many different levels.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|I can't get my girlfriend to stop playing this movie all the time! However, I must admit that I  enjoy the songs.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was disappointed at first with the Chromecast as it basically only supported Youtube and Google media services (which I don't use).  But, now that it works with Pandora, Chrome browser on my PC, and other services being added it's really nice.  When the HBO Go app is added (which I hear is being worked on) and the ability to send music, video and images from my mobile device, I'll give it 5 stars.  It will also then replace the need for my Roku.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|It exposes the dirty tricks that the big pharma companies engage in. They spew downright lies, and we are swallowing their (mostly) useless drugs that do more harm than good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I just started playing this game and I am liking it. my family is laughing at me coz they are all already done with this game.
B006H5120E|5.0|I finally got me a 3D television, and this was added to my collection the next day. I'm sure everyone has seen this movie, so there is no need to say how good it is. The 3D is really good. You can watch the whole movie without felling sick. The 3D they use now is so clear, I don't see how it could bother anyone. The movie was crisp and clear. I just have to add this movie will still move you after all these years, and I can't believe that I can keep watching this 3 hour plus movie, and not get bored. One of the best movies ever made, and glad they made a 3D version. Defiantly worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A game that's both challenging and fun. My sister-in-laws got me attached to this game, I want to play it all the time.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great movie and the 3D is crisp and rich. I never had the chance to read the book, but I heard the movie was good. I ended up just buying it, and it's a great movie. The CGI is really good, and you will easily forget that it's not real. I even had to google to see if it was based of a true story.  I'm just gullible sometimes, but it's an enjoyable movie with great meaning.

B00F8KIJ2I|1.0|It seems Avril Lavigne has shed almost the last of her former punk-rock persona for that of a far more honest lame and uninspired pop star. Because really, that's who she has always been. Avril struck a really nice chord with her debut album Let Go back in 2002, although it was a bit of a reductive retread of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. She followed it up with a mess of a sophomore slump album known as Under My Skin, but little did I know just how bad she was going to get. 2007's The Best Damn Thing was a mixed bag of brilliant balladry and really un-fun cheerleader anthems. What exactly had happened to Avril over the course of those three records? Well, nothing. And that's kind of the problem. If anything, her exterior was just stripping away to reveal absolutely nothing underneath! Lavigne was, however, on the top of the world at the peak of her popularity. And here she thought she could do no wrong. Exactly the right time to release an introspective record that she wrote mostly alone. I mean, her legions of fans will buy it anyway right? RIGHT? Well, no. Goodbye Lullably, her love letter to romance and impending divorce was moderately successful but entirely road the wave of one Top 10 single (What the Hell). The record only served to damage her seemingly untouchable pop empire. The walls were beginning to erode.<br /><br />Cue 2013's eponymous Avril Lavigne, and yet again, Lavigne tricked me. I have to admit that I do own her first three records and I have found something enjoyable in all of them. Sort of a guilty pleasure for me. If nothing else, this girl has a set of pipes on her. Even though I was left slightly disappointed with Goodbye Lullaby, the strikingly adult artwork for her forth LP held my attention. Well, at least until I heard the album's leading single. Its title alone is a shining example of the problem I have with Avril Lavigne: \\"Here's to Never Growing Up.\\" Unfortunately, my dearest Avril, your fans will eventually grow up and wantyou to as well. But this song, co-written by her husband Chad Kroeger of Nickelback infamy, is Avril stomping her feet like a petulant brat. Instead of a joyful anthem of youth, it comes across more like a Kid Rock BBQ party song for people who should probably be worrying more about their credit report than buying a jetski. Oh, that's right, it's a hicksville anthem all the way from Canada. Odd, huh? The worst part is that this song is pretty much indicitive of the problems riddled throughout the rest of the album, much of which also has Kroeger's unnecessary stamp all over it.<br /><br />Avril, who once at least pretended to be her own person, now sounds like the \\"babe\\" of her relationship. It's clearly the girlie companion piece to any Nickelback album, and that is not something that anybody asked for, not even her fans. The album bounces awkwardly between immature party anthems like Hello Kitty (her most lyrically inane song) and soulless slower tracks like Hush Hush, which really don't hit at hard as anything from her previous albums. If you were a fan of Innocence, Anything But Ordinary, or even Stop Standing There, you won't find a whole lot here that Avril hasn't already done better. The bombastic and slick production even make her vocals sound unclear and fuzzy, something I wouldn't expect from an Avril LP. It's not all bad, though. Those at the mixers did a stellar job with Give You What You Like, which is the sound I was hoping Avril would experiment with on this album. Far more interesting than the hyperbeats on Hello Kitty. But this little glimpse of musical maturity is shattered when you hear things like Rock N Roll and the unwarranted Marilyn Manson collaboration Bad Girl (were these two even in the same studio?).<br /><br />Avril's career doesn't seem to be in freefall the same way Ke$ha's is; it's more on a steady decline as fewer and fewer people seem to be interested in what this girl has to say. Has Taylor Swift entirely replaced her? It seems that way. And why do you want a 29 year old woman singing about summer vacation? (No, I'm not kidding. This woman is 29 and has a song on this album about summer vacation). I would not be surprised to see Avril in some tawdry stage musical next in an attempt to keep her name in the papers, or maybe on a sitcom. In ten years, I'll look forward to her acoustic album and her jazz standards album. Maybe her comeback. Until then, I'll have to bid adieu to the Canadian chanteuse whose antics have so thoroughly amused me in the past, even if in secret.<br /><br />Listen to: Give You Want You Like

1594202273|5.0|From the first page  to the last Eric Schlosser captivates with this informational text on American nuclear missiles.  Wrapped around an accident that occurred in a Titan II missile silo, Command and Control takes the reader through a historical account of the U.S.'s atomic program from the Manhattan project through the cold war paranoia. Especially shocking are all the accidents that have occurred with these weapons. Makes one wonder about the overall safety of having these things around.  If you are interested in Americas nuclear race towards weapon superiority, especially the Titan II inter continental ballistic missile, this book is for you; it won't disappoint.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Loved this movie when I was a kid.  Ordered it and now my niece and nephew watch it too.  Classic Disney imagination with live action combined with animation. Its a long movie though.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This was an absolute phenomenal movie. I enjoyed every second of this action packed flick, keeps you on your toes and is non-stop thrills. I highly recommend it in every way possible!
006202406X|3.0|**Warning: I do my best to stay away from spoilers, but since this is the third and final book of a series, I might slip. So beware!**<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed Allegiant much more than Insurgent. But I didn't enjoy it as much as Divergent. I think this is a common trend with trilogies. First book rocks. Second book drags. Third book rocks and drags.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessors, Allegiant went back and forth between two POV's: Tris and Tobias. Overall, I enjoyed this updated format. In fact, I wish Veronica Roth had written the first two books this way. The varying perspectives added a deeper dimension, propelled the story forward faster, and gave the reader a break from Tris (who, lets face it, can be borderline unlikeable at times). My only complaint about this new format: I kept forgetting if I was reading from Tris or Tobias's POV. Because it's written in first person, and because Tris and Tobias are so similar, I'd end up reading entire chapters thinking I was inside the others head. Friends of mine have also complained about this issue. I think a simple solution would've been to add Tris or Tobias's name at the top of each page, or even use the strategy of Marie Lu's Legend with different font colors.<br /><br />**Okay, I'm going to tread into Spoilerville here. I must. Sorry.**<br /><br />The ending. Wow. Just...wow. I'm sure many people will disagree with me, but I liked it. I thought Tris's fate made perfect sense and fit the book's theme of \\"choice\\". And, come on, this was never a happy series. Death and despair and WTF-just-happened? moments were always the norm. I'm still trying to figure out if I liked how Tris died. At one minute I think, \\"Well, it makes sense\\", but then the next I think, \\"Really? Gunshot? Really?\\" I suppose I'm leaning towards the \\"Well, it makes sense\\" side. Just like the death serum, Tris made a choice to get shot. Even though she knew it would mean death if she lunged for the button to release thememory serum, she did it anyways to save those she loved. I liked that.<br /><br />I must applaud Veronica Roth for having the guts and boldness to kill off her main protagonist. I'm so used to YA series ending in a shower of glitter and flutter of butterflies. Even Hunger Games had a sorta happy ending, with Katniss and Peeta building a life together. But Allegiant ended horribly realistically, and, in this case, logically...At least Veronica Roth gave the reader a sliver of satisfaction by taking us a couple of years into the future with Four to see how he's dealing with Tris's death and how the world Tris died for is faring.<br /><br />Even so, it was a bittersweet ending to a bittersweet series.<br /><br />For more book reviews, visit jenspenden.wordpress.com.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|The only reason I didn't give full 5 stars is the book was a little predictable toward the end. But that is just my opinion. The book was well written and the characters were well developed. I personally enjoy a book with angst and this had some.<br /><br />Thank you Kristen Zimmer for putting your talent out there for the world to see.
1476729085|5.0|You had me at Chapter 2!  I loved this book.  I know someone like Don Tillman so I could relate to him.  Simsion captures the complexity of this type of person.  Hard to write new romcoms but this one rocked!  Give me more!!

B00280LYIC|5.0|I just read it to for the fifth time and it is still awesome to be reading. Three more words
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Well, my disappointment is huge. The first issue with this last book of 3 is the sudden swap to dual points of view. It was odd and threw me off track. Then I understood WHY this change was needed, and that led into the second problem--the ending. If a huge stylistic change is made, then it should be for a good reason. And the one in this book was not.<br /><br />The ending was horrible, and this author seemed to have little concern for her readers after their support of the first two books. I doubt I will invest time in her again.
B000XUBC5E|1.0|I couldn't wait to finish it so I could forget it. No real trail for the reader - it wanders around aimlessly, and then he ties it up in 2-3 pages near the end. No fun at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I waited a while to read this second book, but it was excellent. I enjoyed the return to the games and the turn the story took. I just can't decide who I want Katniss to end up with!
B000EUDAWG|1.0|Very slow and loud, didn't scare anybody, replaced batteries often and did not maneuver well at all. Product was not what a good buy considering poor performance.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I was looking for a book that not only exposes many of the myths of the Bible, but details WHY they were written that way so many years after his death.  This answered a ton of my questions (some of them life-long) perfectly!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Interesting from a historical perspective. At times, however, I wondered if Aslan really understands what Jesus' mission was. How can he say Jesus was a failure when Christianity (the kingdom of God) continues to flourish more than 2000 years after Jesus' death?
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I am very satisfied with your app. It's easy to adopt, straighforward, organized. Does what I want from podcast app.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Absolutely awesome telling of a story of courage, love and endurance during WWII. Like most children in Europe at the time, Liesel's childhood was snatched from her and she witnessed things no child should have to witness. Zusak's ability to make the written word come to life is what made this book such a unique page-turner. Although it's categorized as a young adult book, it's definitely one that adults will enjoy.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Excellent and outstanding drama, Julianne Margulies,  plays &#34;The Good Wife&#34; consistently good in this first season, I am planning to watch all new seasons

B003O86FMW|4.0|This is the 2nd book in the series and it shows.  The 1st and 3rd book are the best!  I still can't wait to see the movie!  The main characters keep a rich story and keep you on your toes.  You are left hoping for them to win!
B00C74SHRK|3.0|At the beginning of the book I was hooked. The text reminded me of Tartt's masterpiece &#34;The Secret History&#34;. However, with the departure to Las Vegas, the story loses momentum. The endless vodka sessions not only cause boredom, but almost cause physical pain. Page after page is all about Boris and vodka. From time to time Xandra and his father are woven into the story. At least this many pages could have been omit and &#34;The Golffinach&#34; would have been masterpiece. - Pity about the story that started so well and then totally got out of control, and too bad for the time it took me to read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Exciting! Thrilling!  Page turner!  Hard to put down!  I think that covers it! Waiting for the book to be turned in to a movie.  Should be a shocker to the world!

B0083P1QUM|3.0|Marino falls flat on his face in this book.  If you have read her other books in the series you know all Marino's issues, and there is nothing new here.  Cornwell should have reconsidered Marino's role or take him out!  Scarpetta was fabulous as always.  I do love the historical fiction and medical theory that Cornwell includes!

B003SI7OQ4|5.0|Very funny movie.  Watched with the BF.  Made for a goofy but cool and entertaining time together. Will watch again.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|This Scarpetta Novel is a good mystery, and that is nothing new for fans. I find myself impatient with the backstories and the countless times that Marino's low self-esteem is mentioned, as if we need to be convinced by the repetition of this fact. Scarpetta is superficial in a self-chosen way, and Marino just never even got that far in his development. Scarpetta's personality analyses leave much to be desired. Her crime-site analyses are spot-on, interesting and brilliant. There is much to enjoy as she and Benton complement each other in their choses fields of expertise. A bad apple in the FBI? Not exactly new news for those cynical enough to have once believed otherwise. All in all, a good mystery...dogs included.

B0084IG8TM|1.0|I received the DVD from Netflix. I watched 5-10 min, stopped & sent it back. As a Veteran of 2 VietNam tours, I've seen real killing. I don't intend to watch kids killing kids and call it entertainment. You can watch many documentaries that show the REAL thing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  I couldn't wait to finish the book but didn't want to hurry through because it was so good I wanted it to last forever.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|4 stars because I personally didn't like the movie at all but the package came quickly and in great condition. Terrible storyline in my opinion. For their budget, it could have been way better.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This was a great movie! It was really funny and good for all ages. I highly recommend this to any of my friends.

B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Just not my kind of book. It is very well written, but I found it long and not very interesting.I had a hard time relating to the main character, but I repeat, well written and many people loved this book. I think it is all a matter of personal preference.

It also has very little words for which to complicate things and pretty pictures. A must read, don't know why it isn't the best selling book for all time?
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This movie touches on signs of the making of someone with mental illness and the way parents deal with it. A great movie especially when you think of all the crazy things that are happening at schools, etc. Makes you really think.  I really enjoyed it although it was disturbing at parts.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written, interesting characters and a good story! It's everything you want in a good read! I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B002ZBZNPO|4.0|No, it's not quite as excellent or solid as Fallen, but it's still very good. Snow White Queen is haunting and Good Enough is powerful stuff. Still, even the weakest songs are better than most of what's produced these days. I'm just glad to see a fairly young band doing progressive rock.
B00EAH3D6C|5.0|truly wonderful I have always treasured Legrand's work but was really pleased by the songs as performed.The quality of the vocal performance was superb and really made the music come alive. Thank you for the gift of two great performers coming together.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|YES I KNOW, LIKE I TOLD MY WIFE I ALREADY OWN THE 'UNPLUGGED' CD BUT ALL THE EXTRAS SOLD IT TO ME. THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT SITTING DOWN TO LISTEN TO ERIC PLAY THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO AWAY. (NICE TITLE FOR A SONG). THE DVD GREAT! THE WAY HE PLAYS WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND TAPPS HIS FOOT. I'VE SEEN HIM THREE TIMES IN CONCERT NOW I CAN CLAIM FOUR, WITH MY HOME THEATER SYSTEM.
B002PJN59M|3.0|Too long.  Needs editing of some scenes.  Well acted for the most part.  Good story.  Loved seeing the &#34;young&#34;  Helen Merin.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I did not find it suspenseful enough to even come close to competing with The Shining.  The Shining was better.
B000OKNOKY|5.0|Delivery time was excellent.  I look forward to reading this book.  It was a gift from my wife, and she assures I will love the book.  thank you.
B00CM03H4C|3.0|If you saw the film, and want the same songs, you'll be disappointed. It lacks &#34;Hova 2003&#34;, a song that I love. In fact, I didn't recognize most of the songs on the soundtrack. Hopefully there will be a second soundtrack with the songs I remember from the film, a la &#34;Moulan Rouge&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was such a big disappointment. I've heard the author's \\"reasons\\" for the choice she made to end the book in a way that was sure to alienate many fans. Now instead of looking forward to the movie, I'll pass. I don't want to invest any more of my valuable time to these characters.

B00FIUO8MI|4.0|I have waited a long time for Allegiant to be released on October 22nd of this year. I read both Divergent and Insurgent in this series in January of 2013 and was, as is usual for me, frustrated that the third and final book in the series wasn't due to be released for some time. A reader's hell, right?<br /><br />While I did pick this book up soon after its release, I didn't pick it up on the first day. I waited about a week. I lurk on a few message boards now and again, and during the week that I waited to get my hot little hands on Allegiant I happened to come across some posts regarding the book from other readers who showed even less patience than I. I read those posts even though they clearly stated they contained spoilers.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to post any spoilers here, but I will tell you that the majority of readers on that message board were quite disappointed with Allegiant. They didn't like where Veronica Roth took the story. People were killed that the readers felt should not have been. They felt Veronica Roth had completely changed the character of Four/Tobias. And generally, they were just dissatisfied.<br /><br />For me, Divergent was a five star book. I loved every minute of it. Insurgent, not so much. I felt it should have been able to stand alone and that it just didn't stand up to the standard set by Divergent. I still liked it, but I didn't love it like I loved Divergent.<br /><br />Allegiant falls somewhere in between Divergent and Insurgent for me. I really liked it. And actually, the more I think about it - I do love it. Maybe just a little less than Divergent.<br /><br />Anticipation is a funny thing. On the one hand, I couldn't wait to get Allegiant and begin reading it. I read 61% of it the first night. But then I stopped reading it. I read the remainder in drips and drabs over a two week period. \\"Abie, why on earth would you do that?\\" you might ask.<br /><br />Because I am perverse. Because I had waited so long for this book and knew it was the last in the trilogy. Because I didn't want to get to the end.<br /><br />But now I have gotten to the end, and I must say I disagree wholeheartedly with the people on that message board. I didn't find Allegiant disappointing at all. In fact, I think Veronica Roth got it right. Life is hard. Even harder in a post-apocalyptic world like the one in this series. Tris and Four go through a lot in this book and tragedy can take a toll. People die - even people you don't want to die. There are very few happy endings in reality, and I think Veronica did an excellent job of making this book realistic.<br /><br />Sometimes the story is what the story is. Readers often want happy endings, but happy endings aren't always realistic, and I love this book all the more - just the way it is.new it was the last in the trilogy.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I learned of this book from the movie trailer and knew right away that I wanted to read it. I've never read a book written in the style as this one was written. I felt like I was right there with all of the characters - through the good, but unfortunately mostly the bad. As others have said - there are times you find yourself laughing, and yet this story is such a sad, tragic time in our world's history. Highly, highly recommend, and I will definitely see the movie.
B00BC5AWNM|5.0|Loved this book. Always knew the basic mythology but boy did the whole story surprise me. I wish I could hang out with the characters in this story!<br /><br />Chapter 11 is the only part of the book I felt was slow. I guess this is supposed to be the chapter that describes all the bad things Dorian does but it actually sounds like a damn good time!<br /><br />Anyways, read this book. It's great
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|love this album!! everything i had hoped for..cant stop playing it ..over and over..totally can relate to every song on it.
0689835604|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone who is raising children and are learning about body parts.<br /><br />Very cute read.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|good job on this amazing racing game for my kindle fire hd. I have played a lot of racing games in the past this one is number 1!
B008602KQI|5.0|It dealt with the themes in a sound and captivation way.....it was true to the story as portrayed in the medium of the book....the acting was very strong....it offered some surprises from the novel without being upsetting and that added to the story....
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This book was a quick way for the author to make a few dollars just like the characters in his book. The only difference was the protagonists in the book had to work Way harder for it. Don't waste your time.
0062107313|3.0|As many other reviewers have noted, Tan re-visits her familiar terrain--mother/daughter relationships. That she consistently returns to this theme doesn't bother me as a reader. I loved many parts of \\"The Valley of Amazement\\": I felt that Tan did a wonderful job of showing just how limited these women's lives were. They had very few choices or options. The historical parts about the courtesan houses was extremely interesting to me, as I wasn't familiar with the history at all. The aspect of the book I didn't like: I found it difficult to care for any of the characters, which sounds terrible, considering what some of them went through. I couldn't work up any interest in Lulu Minturn, for instance. I had a bit more interest in Violet's narrative, but she comments on everything from such an emotional remove that I didn't feel a strong emotional connection to her character as I would have liked. (And this could easily be my failing as a reader, and nothing to do with Tan as a writer.) So I give it three stars for the book's rich historical detail, and because I didn't connect to many of the characters. That said, the book is a very worthwhile read.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|I wanted to like this movie since Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actors. But this movie developed too slowly while at the same time having an erratic flow of the development of a romantic relationship between the main characters. I hoped it would be wittier, but it was just plain boring. I think Dustin Hoffman set out to direct a movie specific to opera lovers. No, wait.  Old opera lovers. The final performance was anticlimactic. Kudos to the cameos by actual musicians and singers, but their importance was lost on me since I don't know the genre.  Didn't like this one. At all.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I was uncertain about reading this book because the premise seemed unrealistic.  What a pleasing read this turned out to be.  It was not only believable but much of what he was experiencing struck a chord.  Very enjoyable book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King really hit this one out of the park. Brilliant development of really compelling characters, super-page-turner plot, and resolution for Danny Torrence. What more could you ask for? I know: what happens to Abra? King rarely fails to deliver so I hope he lives and writes for a long, long time.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Joe never disappoints. this CD is one of his best. Always great to listen too especially on a long commute home
B00EJ9RIXA|4.0|Easily gets Google drive documents onto my Kindle. Works as &#34;read only&#34;.  Does not get documents from Kindle back to the Google cloud.
0744014956|5.0|Good strategy guide, tells you most everything you need to know. I had to look online for the stock tips with Lester's assassination missions. On the plus side this guide tells you the locations of every letter scrap, spaceship part, stunt jump, bridge fly-unders, knife flights, submarine part, nuclear waste location, and body armor locations. This guide really comes in useful if you are trying to get 100% completion.
B00847KFDS|5.0|CCR was the first band whose albums I bought, starting back in 68. When 69 came along and they released 3, i didn't know why other bands only put out one album a year. The reason ended up being the songwriting talents of John Fogerty. I know i've gone through at least 3 copies of each over the years before CDs came out.<br /><br />On &#34;Wrote a Song Dor Everyone&#34; John Fogerty sings and plays like someone 40 years younger. He's picked am amazing selection of songs and artists to share the fun with. Keep having fun, John, your fans are loving it
B0089LOG02|5.0|Life, no matter who we are, IS a journey!  It twists and turns through good and bad, suffering and joy, and this book has it all!  Be prepared for an emotionally stirring ride!<br /><br />A true tale of and in American history.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found this difficult to read and could not do so without a dictionary beside me, which slowed down the reading process. The story line left me cold regarding the destructive  attitudes of the characters, and the sexual approach to the younger ones. I know that I am naive regarding the youth of today. I have not read any Harry Potter Books but have seen the movies, and I find the violence in todays movies aimed at the youth is overwhelming. e.g. The hunger games.  It is no wonder we are going to hell in a hand basket.<br />p.s. I consider myself well read and educated but a lot of the words eluded me and when I learnt their meaning could not work out how I would use them in my conversations.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|very slow could not finish this book was  to read I have worked in Publishing and if you can't get my interest in the first100pages I will not finish the book. This book did not stand up to the Kite Runner
B005DJREJS|4.0|I enjoyed the pilot, but I'm not sure I want to pay to watch any additional episodes.  I was surprised at the cost to watch this as a member of Amazon Prime.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|As good as the last one - almost unbelievable how well the characters fill the shoes of the first Trek. And Benedict Cumberbatch - wow - what else can anyone say?
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Looks like a very good series.  Only the pilot was free to watch so I didn't watch any additional episodes on Amazon Prime.  I will look elsewhere.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best games online just can't stop playing it just glad it's free and what to play more
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel was good as usual.  Scary movie for those that fly frequently...you just never know about the guy in the cockpit!
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I like a game that I can Keep playing this was not one of them. Didn't what to delete it but had too
B00AECGQF2|2.0|Only for children. The game is really for children and not for adults since there really isnt much to do in the game. It is a repeat of the characters and doing their hair.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Fascinating sequence of events: growth & development of unloved, uncared child girl who creates her own life. totally lacking in all support, hope and love or &#34;how-to-lessons&#34;. She eventually blossoms, through her devotion to the &#34; language&#34;  of flowers, finds supportive love, maternal love, and romantic love following her own instincts and mistakes.  The happy ending results in the security and warmth she learns to create.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, fun game with great sounds and animation.  It's challenging, but simple at the same time.  And, having to put it down when I lose all 5 lives is a good idea or else it would be impossible to put down!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said?  It is wonderfully written with characters we already care about. I would recommend to everyone'
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I love getting the digital version before receiving the actual CD in the mail. I've always been a physical type of person, I like to hold things in my hand. That's why I like CD's, but I also buy digital music. I like to also have to CD. Amazon makes that possible for me, you can listen to the music immediately, and get the CD.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great app.  Works amazingly in my Kindle fire first gen. Some glitches connecting to Facebook but beyond that a wonderfully created app.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Jack Ryan Snr was my hero and now Junior follows in his footsteps.  Action packed and typical Clancy.  John Clark can't be killed!!  For the Vietnam hero he still keeps on giving.
B004AUFVU0|5.0|Great character development!  Excellent plot development.  Wonderful acting!  Fred Mcmurray is even believable as the &#34;bad guy&#34;.  A must see for anyone who loves &#34;oldies&#34;!
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|A fantastic 3rd instalment to this exciting series. So thrilled to have the story return to Claire and Jamie, even though 2 decades have passed, their story is a passionate, exciting one. I can't wait to see what comes next now the story has taken a new turn.
B005LAII12|5.0|Great movie, very funny and entertaining. Can watch more than once and still get enjoyment out of it. Very funny
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|I fell asleep during the movie but the family said it was good. I don't have a desire to go back and watch it again.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a fun read. It is the perfect vacation read because it's not too heavy but you will want to keep reading.
B00338QENI|5.0|I am a slow reader but I could not put this down.  It generated a large range of emotions as I read and I was constantly asking people about the events.  Family members are now on tour answering questions and giving updates.  I hope they come to Tennessee.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I enjoyed this well written, action packed novel. Dana Barnes was a 26 year old who found herself in a psychiatric ward for five days. After her discharge, she checked into the Americana Hotel, operated by a creepy guy named Earl Hicks. Dana soon moved into Rainbow Connection, a hippie type commune where her sister Zoe lived. Dana was desperately searching for Tyler, her missing boyfriend. The people at the commune tried to convince Dana that Tyler was only a figment of her imagination. Dana tried to escape from the commune and find Tyler. The people at the commune were constantly watching Dana and following her. Read the book to find out if Dana successfully got away from Rainbow Connection.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|every time you make a move you have to pay $$$. Would rather use other games that you can just enjoy.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I will be ordering the other season as well.  Good series.  Maybe I'll ask for this for Christmas!!! !! !!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I have been a Korn fan since I was 12 years old and I believe this album to be one of their best since Issues and Follow the Leader.
B0071MV540|4.0|This collection of excellent comedy actors make for a story that is hilariously well done. Recommended as one of the best of the genre.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|It's difficult to tell if The Name of the Wind's protagonist, Kvothe, has been able to survive his eventful life in spite of his audacious stupidity, or because of it. Somehow he is still alive at the end, despite a positive addiction to making the kind of rash, irresponsible choices that inevitably leave him in dire straits. Kvothe's determination to attend the University (magic school) as a penniless prodigy exposes him to a never-ending litany of casual cruelty, neglect, obstruction, physical abuse and reckless endangerment from his professors. And that's when they're NOT out to get him. Truly, expulsion would be a kindness in comparison. This long-winded, derivative fantasy leaves me feeling nostalgic for the days when leaving loose ends was considered sloppy writing. Now it seems to be de rigeur, especially when the book is part of a series. Kvothe's quest to learn more about the sinister Chandrian and why they killed his parents is left largely unresolved here. I'm sure this could be dragged out for a few more volumes, but I don't feel any need to pursue it.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|This is a great production in the Saga series; producers, director, actors well-coordinated in this top-notch feature film series that only has one equal, in my opinion : Underworld .
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I love this app. I have never had any difficulties with it on my kindle fire or my samsung galaxy tablet. I would highly recommend it to friends &amp; family.
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|A MASTER OF SPY MYSTRIES.  YOU ARE UNABLE TO PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.<br /><br />A COMPELLING TALE THAT WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Great sci-fi series.  My kids(age 8) and I can't get enough. Geronimo!  Those kookie Brits, what will they come up with next?
B00F57VFXO|5.0|\\" Fleming and Bond, Bond and Fleming, a little like the Russian dolls deepening the mystery. Damian has created an exciting fast paced tale with a curious plot. The interplay of the Parsifal myth with recent history adds to the layers of interest. You will enjoy this book and seek out those that have gone before whilst awaiting with anticipation those to come.\\"<br />[[ASIN:B00F57VFXO The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal]]
6304696566|5.0|Great movie..  One of the best westerns ever made.  One of John Wayne's best movies.  A must see for lovers of western movies.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I can't. I just can't. It's impossible to sum up the effect LOST has over anyone who watches it. Seriously the best show that has ever been on television. I could go on for days about how much I loved it. I just finished my third time through the entire series and I'm sure I'll go through it again. Just a fantastic, brilliant and meaningful journey through life. Loss, love, misery, and the process of leaving it all behind and becoming a better being. &#60;3
B006BFK5DK|3.0|Good but not great..  We need more of the old Earth, Wind And Fire..  Good for background music at dinner or small party.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love to play this game, and I love that it has never become boring to me after many many moons of play.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great book on Adams and American history.  We need people like him now.  After reading it I gave it to a friend who loved it.
B001F0TM5I|5.0|Another Tarantino masterpiece!  No one makes them better!  The music, the characters, the camera angles and film grain, outrageous car chase, and a great plot.  I am sure a lot of people will walk away saying &#34;that was stupid&#34; and &#34;I don't get it&#34;.  I feel sorry for those people...I really do.  The more I watch Death Proof the more it moves up in my list of Tarantino favorites.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|Van Cliburn is a Master of interpretation and getting the &#34;whole works&#34; pulls my love for the world of the classics as performed by<br />the best--Van Cliburn.  As his mother told him at an early age--the music has to flow as if you are singing it!  Oh, me, with the works, I can relive time and time again, the wonderful world of the classics as performed by Van Cliburn, the best.  Thank you for this collection.  It is over the top, and I shall enjoy his performance again and again, and again!  Just love it!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Loved it even more than Flynn's Sharp Objects and Gone Girl.  Super creepy and twisted thriller!  Highly recommend if you dare to walk on the dark side!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is wonderful. It was recommended by a friend who has seen results just short of amazing from her memory returning to her stomach problems disappearing. It was worth it for me to try.  I recommend it to everyone.
1609611543|5.0|I bought this for a gift for a friend who works hard to cook very healthy.  She has incorporated many of the recipes into her family's meals and is enjoying the book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Awesome film. Love the convenience and great deals I get shopping with amazon.. If you want to see a great story and visually beautiful scenery you will be happy with this purchase.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|It was excatly what I was looking for, the original movie release with the voices-over and the quality just superb!!
B00GGEV828|5.0|13 dwarves - why not 13 more minutes? I love that these moves have extended editions - the long length of the Tolkien films gives them a chance to have something a lot of blockbuster films don't these days - something other than action! I love it. If you love the movies - it's totally worth it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Because I have large fingertips, I must use a stylus, which will occasionally drop the puzzle piece where it doesn't belong.  Picking it up again to move it to where it belongs can get frustrating.
B00DW475CC|1.0|An angel yearning/lusting for the bishops wife?<br />What's wrong with that picture?<br /><br />Read the Book of Enoch and you'll learn why it's wrong.<br /><br />His desire for a woman is unnatural and should never have<br />been part of the story.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is the best, no one can get anything like this for the fun, and information  it gives you I enjoy it a lot and use it often.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Easy to set up and I can hear clearly, I use it instead of the one built into my car.  Very long battery life. Easy to take with me when I am out of the car.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|You watch it once then twice then you just know you well watch it again.  This is one my most loved movies its funny, and makes you glad your Christmas is not anything like the movie.  Even the music is great and funny. Chevy Chase out performs himself in this one with a cast of wonderful people to add to the plot.  A must watch.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|True Ken Follett style - well researched and an excellent read.  I love the way he makes the reader live the lives of his characters. I await the follow up with anticipation.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|A fast reader and fun. to follow. Gives one the chance to feel and experience something by reading it first hand
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I've played this cd several times since receiving it.  It's great!  I love that they're branching out, and I don't mind in the least that not every single song is a duet.  They should record songs separately.  Nowhere in Jonathan's thank you's does it say that Charlotte is going her own way.  I'm not sure where that came from.  He does say that she has a love for musical theater and it would be a shame if she didn't get to live her dream some day.  I know there was some complaining that there are two Christmas songs on this cd.  There are.  Perhaps they're there because there wasn't time to get a complete Christmas cd together.  At any rate, this is a wonderful cd.  They're trying something new, and in my opinion, it works.  I look forward to buying many more of their cds.
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|A fast paced action movie, I really liked it a lot, The acting was great, the plot was cool, and the movie kept you in your seat.  This one I watched twice because it moved so fast in some parts I wanted to see them a second time.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Great story telling illuminating the broken and romantic facets of all of us. Weaving redemption and hope, a quick and reflective read....recommend
B000002LIM|5.0|it's a great SoundTrack i still got the old VHS Movie's of Batman Original and more but can play them but the soundtrack put's you back in like you watching the Movie with the Music playing. it also help's me to relax after a hard days work.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|My stepson (age 12) was looking for a series to read and we had heard one of these books as an audiobook.  I was somewhat bizarre but very intriguing.  He liked the book so much that he is working through the rest of the series.
006202406X|5.0|After I was done reading my husband asked me what was wrong. I started explaining my frustration about certain plot twists (I will keep this spoiler free). The more I talked the more I appreciated Roth's vision. I may not like all Roth's choices but I can respect them. I give this book 5 stars because everyone should give this book a chance. It might not be the ending you want but it is beautiful in its own right.
B00ESB6GBY|3.0|It's clear that the writers have painted themselves into a corner as the finale approaches.  The actors seem unenthusiastic as they drudge along and WHO cast that girl as &#34;the mother&#34; when Ted has dated some real smoke shows!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|loved the movie. Good special effects and great acting. Gives a decent backstory of krypton. One of my favorites ever
B00GH4R95C|2.0|This is one of those movies that I hate to dislike. I love Superman. I've seen all of the movies a good twenty times each, watched the cartoons, even sat through Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. But, this was just a misguided attempt at bringing Nolan-esque storytelling into a Superman movie. I thought Henry Cavill did a good job as Supes, and I can't wait to see him again in Batman vs. Superman.<br />I thought the father-son moments between Pa Kent and Clark were ludicrous and so unlike Jonathan Kent as to be a parody of him. Jonathan's death was just horribly played out. I think that's when I lost interest.<br />I'm glad others enjoyed it, but try as I might, it just comes off as a ten year old's fantasy for a &#34;really cool&#34; Superman film. It's loud, obnoxious and just overdone in the action department. I sat through the final action scene hoping the next punch would be the last. It just needed to be edited and cut down.<br />This isn't fanboy hate, because I don't hate it. It's not a horrible movie and that makes it even worse, because I sat and thought about how great it could have been after watching it. Hopefully, the second time around it will be better!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gave me quite an insight into the duties, equipment and experiences of a sniper.  A very interesting book which shows how warfare is changing.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Yea! Vintage that never grows old. Enjoy the wholesome goodness, comedy, interplay of the actors , and the good times of the memories.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|This is a very good drama but a sad story.  It is almost a documentary.  Angelina is raw and studied her role wel.
1596680296|3.0|Right off the bat, P. 26, no illustration for Sl1 purlwise with yarn in back. I'm a beginner. Lots of illustrations on P. 23 on how to join up when working in the round, and on P. 27, three images of what various heel flap stitches look like. But no illustration on how to make the Sl1 stitch. I'm on the beginning of the book. I'm studying the instructions prior to actually trying my first sock. I had flipped through the book, read here and there, and I'm hopeful. But if there is no illustration on how to create a stitch that is used to make the first pair of socks. I looked it up on Youtube and had a nice lesson. Maybe later I'll be happier about the clarity of instructions. Also, this book needed a copy editor for P. 25, Leg:<br />\\"Continue working even in stockinette stitch (knit every stitch of every round)\\", etc. Did she mean there might be an alternative to knitting in stockinette stitch? Or did she mean, \\"working evenly,\\" in stockinette stitch?
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I'm the minority I believe.  I thought the story  telling was just ok, but the story was weak and  other than the first revelation, it went just as you would think it would. At one point I said, oh she's not really going to do that....but she did.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series is incredible. Great characters in a great story that has twists you can't believe. Never a dull moment. Though it is a long book, it doesn't feel like it. I can't seem to put it down. On to the next
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual, the master outdid himself. This book was an excellent<br />Sequel to the Shining, I found myself thinking about it during my busy days, wondering what would happen next.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's truly a great game, would be better if you could buy any weapon with hunter bucks instead of gold.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So terrifying and beautiful! I got sucked into Briarcliff inspite of aliens and nazis and hateful Docters, because the stories about flawed people are true. I loved every second of this disturbing show.
B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|Go to the menu settings, second to the last line says \\"Calcuration setting.\\" LOL!<br />I don't need to list all the other UI problems others have noted- I can't take my eyes off this error:<br />Makes me think- Does it calcurate?<br />Permissions and small file size save it from a zero-star, not a .99 cent app yet.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Just good clean fun, well maybe not clean but certainly fun. Even if the basic formula from the general weekly plot shows does not change much, it is still a well made show and very entertaining.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|A timeless classic movie that the whole family can see over and over again. It definitively is worth the money!
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|We watch it over & over & over & over.  Love it! Even my toddlers are entranced the whole time!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pinterest! This is awesome on my Kindle Fire HD. It is user friendly, and is my favorite site to check out what's hot!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has taken us to a different level of finding things we want to do, and things that we have done, just with a new twist..
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|can't use this app. I click on it and nothing happens. This must not have been tested too much before release.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As with all of John Grisham's books, he keeps your attention throughout.  Once you start reading you can get all the characters in line for an absolute great read.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|It is what I ordered  what else can  I say  we wanted the movie and now we have it  Ok ?
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I needed an app that would allow me to make folders of my recipes as well as other documents.  This app has been a great addition to my kindle.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|A wonderful book.  So good in fact, I am going to start reading it again and maybe again after that!  I highly recommend everyone read this book.
B00D8RYV52|3.0|Doesn't really do a lot. We have a free game that is almost the same thing (minus the stickers) that is actually better. My son barely ever plays this game despite being a huge car fan and playing tons of other car games. It is in desperate need of additional content/mini games. It says garage, but from what I recall there is little more than painting, decorating, adding gas, and a few other small things. Multi-step repair of interesting parts of the car and engine would be much more appropriate for the title and to be in line with the rest of the series. It would also be great if the small driving area would change, every time it's the same hill, the same buildings, etc. Very limited even for a 99 cent purchase and definitely not worth 2 bucks. Our least favorite Dr. Panda, but could have been the best.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Most tech-savvy users will find setup and operation a breeze. There's a slight learning curve for those less technologically inclined, but all can become masters after a little practice.<br /><br />It may not be as user friendly as AppleTV right out of the box, but the price point can't be beat for those only looking to stream Netflix.
B00D2HTRVQ|4.0|Not our favorite Dr. Panda. Not the worst. It seems the older ones had much more content than the newest ones have had. There was a fair amount to do in this one, but creativity is pretty limited. Controls weren't always perfect either. Overall good, but we prefer veggie garden and supermarket. My son is 3.5.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Charlie Hunnan is a good actor and always like watching him on other than Sons of Anarchy, which is an awesome series also!
B005R32L66|1.0|On my Samsung Galaxy s3, when I try to make a call using the S voice, it won't go through, because a screen pops up asking if I want to complete through the phone's network or through Skype. Since I'm driving, I don't want to look down at the phone to make a choice with my fingers. I tried going into Settings to stop that screen from popping up, without success. I emailed to Skype, and they suggested uninstalling and re-installing, which also didn't work. So, I simply uninstalled it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! Although it is challenging I still keep at it until I reach the next level! Sometimes it makes me a bit irritated when I'm stuck on a level but I still come back to it eventually. Great Game!  KEEP EM COMING!!!
B009K916ZK|2.0|I'm sure this probably works fine but maybe my Mac book is just outdated (or I don't know what im doing) ... I got it to connect my laptop to my monitor and tv ...  It didn't work for either .... The picture was distorted
1878424319|5.0|Exactly what I was hoping for - in a very timely manner.  We had a Batman Movie Marathon - grandsons loved it!
0399255370|1.0|I love the idea of colors having personality.  I love the idea of crayons talking. And I love the artwork in this book; nevertheless, all the positive reviews puzzle me.  I read it to a kindergartner, and then to a preschooler. It didn't capture the attention of either one.<br /><br />Are there real kids who like this book? On the simplest level, the book is boring.<br />The letters from the crayons are long, full of silly stereotypes, and, as I already mentioned, BORING. If this is the best children's book of 2013, it has been a very rough year for writers.<br /><br />If you are looking for great children's books, skip this one, and choose some true winners: The Napping House, Ira Sleeps Over, George and Martha, or millions of others which keep kids' attention and have gentle (not whiny) humor.
006202406X|2.0|Although I was not happy with the ending, I am ok with the way it ends. I don't need a happy ending to enjoy a book, or a series. What I do need though is smooth writing with transitions when moving from one character to another. This book was so horribly written that when Roth changed from the perspective of Tris to Four, I was more often than not, unable to tell the difference. I found myself flipping back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was speaking. If I had bought the Kindle version I would have pulled my hear out scrolling back and forth! The voice of the characters all sound alike. Even Christina, who has been, up to this point, one of my favorites, has slid into the background. I feel like I have invested too much time into a book series that is just not worth it once I reached the end. I have no issues with death in a story, but I feel like if someone dies in a book, there should be a reason for the death, or at least make it worth while. That just doesn't happen in Allegiant, and there are several deaths where I question the validity. Had this book published before school began a couple of months ago I would not have began reading Divergent aloud to my class. I feel like they are only going to be disappointed in the next two books. Two of my students read this book after finishing Insurgent, and both of them came back disappointed. I just tell them I understand, since I too was disappointed. In the course of this school year I have already read at over 50 books, and I can say that this one definitely falls at the bottom.
B00ESNE696|5.0|I missed this show because Sunday Night Football ran into the time slots for the evening.  I love that I can just go to Amazon.com and order any show at anytime!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I had previously played my older son's download of Journey and loved it. This product is triple good because you get all 3 of That Game Company's games PLUS the amazing music. Could not find this collection at my local game shop.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I did enjoy this series, and watched season 1 2 and 3, so that says something about keeping the audience wanting more.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is one of the best strategy games I've ever played it cause you to think like you really should in war and its fun
B00821OX98|2.0|Kind of a waste of time I don't know if it's still on TV, but if it is skip it and watch Walking Dead instead.  I don't like zombie movies and love aliens which is a surprise that I would watch The Dead instead
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Disturbing on many different levels. Crafted well. Kept me riveted and certainly cost me many hours of sleep. Our book club discussed it in depth and had many different interpretations of it. Sad, oh so sad.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book could not put it down I would definite recommend better than 50 shades by 50 times great
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction. Follett has another winner!. The families and interrelationships he creates to weave his stories over the wars makes the history so interesting you are learning history. His research is always so well done.
B0062YADWI|5.0|Very nice carabiner. Good clip strength, nice size for my keys. I was worried that the squarish shape and ridges would get caught in my pocket but I have not found that to be the case. The bottle opener works great, and that's really what I bought it for.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Too much of the same storylines.  Didn't like the ending of the third book.<br />I do like the supporting characters.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I make a big pot of mac n cheese sit my ass down and watch How i met your mother its the only thing that gets me through my sad lonely existence is knowing these characters are my friends in my head love this show love this set. wish i was the mother!!! to marshal !!! lol
B004LK5CEE|5.0|The Director's Cut - a perfect film, one of the best - shows time and place perfectly - great acting, great script.  This is how it should have been seen in theaters.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|It is a romantic film for people who love dancing.  It's a girl dancer at a night club for men who want an audition at a ballet academy.
B0001MLMKY|4.0|This is a good, retro-looking watch (retro compared to today's casual watches) that fits comfortably on your wrist and looks a lot like the Swatch I had over 25 years ago.  It keeps time well, and the numbers / timepiece hands are easy to read.  I use this one when I am working outside and it stands up to what I put to it.  If you are looking for an affordable, nice-looking casual watch that doesn't look \\"out there\\" by today's standards, I would recommend this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kids had a great time trying to f figure out the clues. They can't wait for more levels to come
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thank you charlaine harris for finishing this series so well. I love your books and read everything I can get my hands on, but this series was my first of hers so it was special.I never watched the tv series and then I heard I should be glad. This book wrapped up the story well and my hero won in the end so I'm ecstatic.
B0047SF41G|4.0|All star cast and a interesting twist to the predator hunt.  I have seen this movie 5 times and it never fails to entertain me.  The pace is perfect and there are no wasted moments.  No romance and a very real sense of impending doom.  Great action flick.  Well written and really possibly the best Predator movie.  The original is great but I feel this one could stand alone.
