B0057XMCLA|4.0|This was a good movie, very exciting and good graphics, etc.  However, it was not at all true to the book.  So, it may make it more appealing to those who didn't read it, but was disappointing for those of us who had.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I devoured the book in hardcover and then got myself a kindle version for perusal.  I can't say enough about the book -- it's chock full of surprising information.  But...the kindle version has a flaw.  It does not include the graphs -- only the captions for them.  Very irksome.  I would not have bought an abridged version of the book if I'd known.  I was going to get a kindle version for a friend, but now I think I'd better get the hardcover version instead.  Please fix this.
B001EOOQF6|4.0|This is about 90% of the record that \\"Heaven And Hell\\" is, and I love it. On paper, this band shouldn't work, but it does and I return to this version of the band more often than I return to the Ozzy records. The late RJD was a giant among musicians, much less rock singers and he is at his peak on these two Sabbath records. I wish they had stayed together longer, but they didn't, and we have these two great studio records and an uneven live record to show for this version of the band. ( \\"Dehumanizer\\" was much later and not up to the task, IMHO ) This CD is worth twice the price, easily, and anyone who likes metal should own it.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Thank you Dr. Kissinger for sharing your wisdom and experience. And thank you for your decades of effort dedicated to shepherding the development of peaceful relations between the United States and China. This book is a fascinating, clearly written survey of the history of Western (primarily U.S.) military and diplomatic engagement with China.  At times, you are in the room with Dr. Kissinger and top Chinese leaders at pivotal moments in the evolution of Sino-U.S. relations. The book provides great context for understanding the current state-of-play in Sino-U.S. relations and offers hope that the constructive arc set in motion by Nixon and Kissinger and sustained through decades and across political parties can and should be sustained for the sake of both nations and all humanity.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|A nu.ber of readers who are obviously not experienced Sherlockians have written complaints about the Study in Scarlet suddenly switching to a different story called &#34;The Book of Morman.&#34;  It's not a different story.  It's part of A Study in Scarlet.<br /><br />Book 2 of the story is a &#34;flashback&#34; section that goes back and explains why the killer committed the murders.  After you've finished reading that section, the story returns to the main narrative and you learn how everything turns out.  It's the way the story is supposed to go, it's not a publishing error.  Relax and enjoy the wonderful story.<br /><br />Trust me.  I'm a 50-year-old college professor, I first read this story when I was 10, I own 3 hardcopy editions and 4 electronic editions of the story.  I have read all of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories more times than I can count.  I know what I'm talking about.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun, gets ya thinking, worth the download, runs smooth on nexus. additive strategy type game. got as free app of the day but would so totally have paid for it
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am enjoying playing this game. It's very relaxing. It's a good game to play before going to sleep at night.
B007R41E8O|2.0|I just brought this game 3 mins ago and its not loading...and I have the kindle fire...a little annoyed. Maybe need tech support b.c I want to play my 99 cents worth
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book literally took my breath away. The author is so detailed of every event, every setting - its like you're part of the book - sensing the character's emotions, tasting the caramel treats, picturing the circus all through your imagination. I will never get over this book - it made me feel like a kid again - imagining the impossible.
1401907725|5.0|I received the deck an hour ago and after reading the booklet, opened the deck and asked a question. I AM SO DARN SURPRISED ON HOW ACCURATE THE ANSWER IS. The answer I got from the card was so accurate and appropriate to the question I asked..<br /><br />I really thank Amazon to recommend these cards to me. Yes, I ordered a Doreen Virtue book a few days ago and the next amazon recommended these cards to me. I read the reviews and ordered these. I am so glad I did....<br /><br />This deck is a must have.....
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I've lost a bit of interest in Sinead's career in recent years. First, the religion thing was really starting to get to me since I consider myself staunch agnostic, plus I was really starting to think I would never see her live so it starting to wane my interest in her as well.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of 'Faith and Courage'. I actually think it's a peak for her, and honestly, if there were any justice in the world, it  should have been a huge hit record around the globe. However, since Sinead will always be known as the angry women who ripped up a picture of the Pope on Saturday Night Live about 98 years ago, he records will continue to flop, no matter how good.<br /><br />I really can not get enough of 'How About I Be Me, and You Be You?', from the very first note of \\"4th and Vine\\" to the very last note of \\"V.I.P.\\". Sinead's voice is in fine form the entire way through (probably THE most underrated female vocals in history!)<br /><br />I am not going to do a song-by-song review (I will say a favorite is \\"Old Lady\\" as well as \\"The Wolf Got Married\\"), but I will just say I don't think there is a bad song on this record. Again, I didn't think she could ever match 'Faith and Courage' ever again, but I think she may have managed it on 'How About I Be Me, and You Be You?')<br /><br />Oh, and thank you for a date in Chicago in May...I FINALLY GET TO SEE YOU LIVE !!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simply awesome puzzle app, I highly recommend to other puzzle solvers!  Nice, relaxing music and intuitive, challenging game format.  More levels please!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great time playing this fun game. runs smooth on my kindle fire.<br />I would reccomend this for all ages.<br />I give it five stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved every bit of this book. So much detail, pulled you right in, believing every moment. You feel for the  characters and can put yourself right next to them. The imagery is fantastic!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the game Oregon trail wish more of my friends would play it. get this game and you'll love it!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is just a puzzle game but the graphics and the music are beyond what you expect. It makes a huge difference on the enjoyability of the app.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Works fine on my Kindle Fire. Nice music and the difficulty level is just right. I love getting the achievements.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't put the books down. Why must there only be 3?! As good as the first novel, if not better. Reminds me of the Fallout game series.
B006RUJST6|5.0|WOW! This book will make anyone an emotional wreck.  I cryed through most of it. This book was awesome!! A top 5 for me!! I couldn't put it down. You WILL cry. Prepare now. But don't wait another minute to read this book!! I can't decide if this really is my favorite book, or if it's just the fact that my timing with reading this book made the whole book so emotional for me. I loved it from page one...I want to read it again right now....but I just downloaded the second book in the two-book series. I'm kinda scared to read it since I'm still an emotional wreck from book one! BUT you should buy this book today!!  It is a love story....yet there is so much more to this book than the main love storyline. I don't want to give any of this story away. I knew nothing about it before reading it and I think that's the best way to go!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is what the FAOTD should be.  not ad ware pay to play no functional garbage.  fun game well made and not scary permission wise.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I realy like this game is lets awesome I'm already on world 3 and I love it im hope theirs a lot more levels to go
B0051HNMTI|5.0|Very good routines, simple to use and the video instruction is perfect. Highly recommended. I use it daily. Five stars.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|This is a great way to stimulate ones mind. I play this game everyday. Bowling makes one think and even though there.  is no physical exertion there is the activity of the mind.
B000099T2L|5.0|My service was wonderful.  I got my cd's so fast, I didnt expect them to arrive that fast!! I'll be back!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great simple platformer which plays like games you know and love. Give it a go for a couple of hours of fun
B0002XMF5S|4.0|I bought this album originally when it came out on cassette.  I was 16 at the time and just getting into Sabbath.  I was not aware then that this was actually Tony Iommi's first solo album and that label pressures slated it as Black Sabbath 'featuring' Tony Iommi.  At the time I will admit I was initially put off a little by the absence of Geezer Butler on bass but found it to be a pretty good effort with former Deep Purple singer-bassist Glen Hughes on vocals.<br /><br />Having recently purchased the album again on cd I can say it still stands up as a great misfit rock album that is perhaps a better Tony Iommi solo project than a transitional Sabbath album in hindsight.  The full on up tempo rocker 'In For The Kill' transitions into the powerful but ballad-esque 'No Stranger To Love' (the only single back then if memory serves me) and works better than it should for some reason oddly setting the mood for this album.<br /><br />They pick up the pace one more time with an in your face track 'Turn To Stone' and then Goeff Nicholls intros the rest of the album with a keyboard interlude 'Sphinx The Guardian' that begins a succession of plodding deliberate emotional tracks that take the rest of the album out through an overcast atmosphere provided by Iommi's characteristic heavy sound throughout.<br /><br />Seventh Star the title track pays homage to Sabbath's darker topics with middle eastern overtones.  Hughes delivers a soulful performance as usual always finding a voice for Iommi's vision.  'Danger Zone' makes a defiant plea not lost on youthful angst.  'Heart Like A Wheel' finds Hughes on a soul searching mission as Eric Singer and Dave 'The Beast?' Spitz roll through a bluesy backbeat for a long number that sets up Iommi for possibly his bluesiest exploration since Sabbath's early material on Warning - great stuff.  'Angry Heart' clarifies that this is an album about personal struggles and defiant willpower.  It breaks down to perhaps the most powerful track 'In Memory' which sort of stuck with me long after I lost the cassette years ago.<br /><br />Well worth it especially when you realize it's a Tony Iommi album.
B005EVVPUE|5.0|This DVD is a MUST if you are a Queen fan!! It covers the entire Wembley Stadium concert, with Freddie in all his absolute glory. He is a spectacular performer and Queen is a phenomenal band. I recommend it HIGHLY!!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The American Sniper must have had a lot of time to reflect on running the war in Iraq, but his view of the strategy was not nearly as sharp as the cross-hairs he placed on his victims.  A capable SEAL, a patriotic American, and obviously a good shot, Kyle is the uber-macho fighter who sees solutions at the end of a fist.  This book does not even belong on the same shelf as Lone Survivor.  Now that was a real SEAL story.  How American Sniper has remained on the best seller list for so long is both a military and literary mystery to me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Straight forward game, ready to pick up difficult to complete all levels perfectly. nice presentation, nice graphics. Worth the cash.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I love this app on my kindle fire it works great doesn't freeze and has wonderful graphics I play it all the time. its a great game to pass thetime
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is great. Others talked about pixals dancing. The only thing I could see were the raindrops dripping down the screen. Looks great on the Kindle Fire. Thanks faotd!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Got this game a few days ago and I love it! As of today, April 11, 2012 the game is still free.<br /><br />Now for the game! It is very much like Mario 3 for nintendo. your leprechaun jumps over snails and other critters. There are pinecones that you collect that you can use to shoot at these critters. Coin collecting, breaking of ledges may drop a four leaf clover (1 up). Very good graphics. Get it free today sooo fun!
B003X5UDEW|5.0|Its been a long time since I enjoyed a good Kung Foo Movie. I been entertained by both IP MAN and IMAN 2, a good Kung Foo flicl... Watch them babk to back. Not sure what the third will be liked though. Am very pleased with the first two IP MAN movies
B0079R8IYW|3.0|The flap thing on the back just doesn't stay in. The case slips loose easily weather in the typing position or the upright position.<br /><br />I like the idea for the typing position, as this was the only case i saw that did both typing and upright around this price.<br /><br />But, its just not working to well for me.<br /><br />UPDATE: This case isn't so bad...but just not to my liking....so I purchased this model: [[ASIN:B0079R8KO0 Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire, Black]]<br /><br />That case work much better for me....much sturdier feel.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Well worth the price of admission. The game plays well on my HTC Evo. I normally hate puzzle games but this one is presented well. The puzzles are fun and logical.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Been a Spielberg fan ever since he did his first movie so looked forward to this one.  This one is not one of his best.  First of all - way too long.  Several parts of this had me saying \\"move on!!\\"  It gets really slow in some parts.  Then he seems to go for the easy emotional stuff way to much.  After watching this I was shocked that it was nominated for best picture.  It is an OK film, but no where near that kind of praise.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this on my iphone ogrinaly, but now it's on my kindle and I love it. Just like Mario.
0761169253|2.0|This is fluff. I read it in about 12 minutes. Good reminder of things you already know sprinkled with inspiring quotes from famous people. If you want a light easy read with a few good ideas, go for it. But don't kid yourself -- there is nothing new or particularly thought-provoking here. You'd be better off reading a couple months worth of Seth Godin posts for free. Or go read a serious business book by Jim Collins or the like.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This is the best music I have ever heard, without a doubt. My life is now complete. Thank you, Coldplay. The sheer joy for the heart and mind of fantastic music is incredible. I have lived. I have truly lived. God has allowed us unworthy creatures to sample a bit of His Heavenly gifts down here on earth and Coldplay has interpreted it right onto their latest album. Amazing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I found this to be a very relaxing enjoyable game.  I am surprised there were so few bad reviews since it is such a calm game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|rarely post but this game was fun and worth the time. kids enjoyed it too.<br />worked great on my htc
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great graphics, pleasant background music. Plenty of tutorial info, and chance at hints. All optional.<br /> I got it for free from the app of the day, but it definitely is something I would have dropped a dollar for, had I known. Somebody who can construct and think through a game app this well,  should look into writing productivity SW. And show that people who write in Java really can turn out kwality with a Q if they try.
0307455874|1.0|I will admit that I have not read on word from this book.  Today, I am taking a play from the liberal playbook and giving a one star review to a book that I know nothing about because I despise the person that authored the book.  It was written by a man who is destroying our great country with his agenda.  He will exploit anything or anyone for his own personal political gain.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its so addicting its more than adding games it reminds me of my favorite games on the nes Mario bros
B0052U59F4|5.0|Go ahead and just buy all 3 books in ths trilogy.  You won't stop until you finish the 3rd one and then you might start over again!<br />This is the hottest, sexiest, story I have ever read!
B0055SWM08|5.0|the game's puzzles are interesting, better than any match three game.  the backgrounds are very pretty and have a great nostalgic feel.  the music is very relaxing, but becomes a little incongruous when the frustration level rises while trying for a perfect score.  all in all a very nice diversion.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|this game is so awesome I love it and when your at plz plz gameloft just plz just for me or anyone else plz make a eternal legacy 2 plz that game is my life.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was captivated right away. The photos did not help in choosing this game, it was the reviews! I like the backgrounds and the music is perfect for this. I found myself melting away the minutes while trying to solve the puzzles. It looks simple but I find extra challenge in not just getting through the puzzle once,  but in the shortest moves possible. you will enjoy it too.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|I think this game stinks. I love Super Mario and this is a knock off. It kills you way to easily. I suggest u not to buy it. It is very difficult.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great fun!!!! Fast and funny....I love it!!!! You'll get hooked!!!!  Go through different levels....squashing bugs and getting pots of gold and coins!!!!
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Google sync works perfectly.  The simple UI is extremely easy to use and it does everything that I need it to.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|First, the biggest disappointment for me was the fact that the scene in the teaser trailer, where she says the pearls are non-negotiable and then smiles and then gets fierce looking and says, \\"That's the tone we want to strike,\\" well, that is not in the movie.  The line about the pearls is there but that fierce \\". . .tone we want to strike\\" is gone.  Too bad, because when I saw that last August, I knew Streep would win the Academy Award for that role.  Every now and then you'd recognize Streep, but for the most part you really believe she's Thatcher.  Just a superlative job by probably the greatest actress alive.<br /><br />Beyond that the story is totally made up.  It isn't based on any book, or biography or autobiography.  It's just the imaginings of the writer, imagining what Mrs. Thatcher is doing all day at her house in Mayfair.  It's a really quite mean and negative view of her.  And this isn't a left wing/right wing thing.  The book \\"Game Change\\" did a number on Hillary Clinton, and not just Sarah Palin.<br /><br />I don't recommend it other than getting the chance to watch Meryl Streep.  But be forewarned, it's a deadly slow moving film.  I actually did paperwork while watching it.  The Descendants, on the other hand, totally riveted.  Loved it.<br /><br />Best advice, rent don't buy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lep world is a fun game to play give it a try you will not stop playing its fun for everybody dont matter what age you are
B000JIHP88|4.0|This product is really great and works very well. I believe it would have been better if it operates on power. The batteries are expensive and requires 3 batteries. On a regular use, set of 3 batteries would last for 2-3 weeks at most. Fisher Price should have kept an option to attach an adapter.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app on the ipod touch/ipad/iphone and it is exactly the same on the kindle. that's great because some games have major lag or a static screen and are hard to play but this is a great app. and its very fun.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I just finished watching this and it is an absolutely brilliant film.  The story is so well told and they use Hawaii as a character.  The story is about a family on the verge of selling off a huge, undeveloped piece of property.  Right at the start George Clooney's wife is in a boating accident.  The doctor tells him she's never going to recover.<br /><br />It's all about loss and love and letting go and holding on at the same time.  Clooney is really good and the end is sad but very sweet.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the rent is too damn high things were better back in the day. but this game is alright for today
B0076NAW48|1.0|This is an unnecessary release. At times, it is well played, but it lacks the feeling that characterizes the great blues album.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|this game is really stupid but totally addicting and fun! you can spend hours on this game fringe to unlock blades and backgrounds and you should only buy it if you really don't want adds because those are distracting in games like these. so its worth the money but you can buy it free and the only thing different is there are ads
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Bought this as a gift for wifey who loves the show.<br /><br />She loves it (which pretty much makes me love it too), and that is all that counts, right?
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is phenomenal. Addictive, intuitive, fun to play, and perfectly coded. I cant put it down! This has very quickly become my favorite game.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app works well on the Fire...probably the best rss app for the Fire.  It ties in very well with Google Reader which was a must for me.
B007STBUIW|5.0|It is about time! Whenever a new format comes out this movie should be on the top of the list to get released. To me this is the greatest movie ever! Of course it put the fear of God in me back in 1975. But once I got over that is is just a great movie. I saw this at Emory in Atlanta a few years ago and the guy who was running the film for a festival they were having mentioned about all of the firsts that JAWS had done or set records for but he ended his speech with flat out it is just really a great movie I think that just somes it up. Plus I love watching all the young people still screaming there heads off at certain moments in the movie. Speilberg hit this one out of the park and set the standerd for others to follow. This movie is one for the ages it grabs you from the first frame and does not let go!! If you ever get to see this in a theatre please do!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Bought this as a gift for wifey who loves the show.<br /><br />She loves it (which pretty much makes me love it too), and that is all that counts, right?
0439023513|1.0|Books one and two were excellent reads, I don't know what happend when Collins got to this book. Seems like she got tired of her own story and just switched! I don't have to have a fairytale ending but I need for endings to make sense and answer important points made in the story. Very disappointing read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy and fun! Don't get bored with it as fast as most games like it! Graphics are very pretty also!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is addicting and keeps me coming back for more.  I was doubtful at first.  this is a large game but no lagging on my kindle
B0059XTUVI|1.0|If your looking for an historical \\"Docu Drama\\" DON'T bother with this movie, it was a horrible disappointment. Much of the movie was spent on scenes of \\"MT\\" in the last years of her life stumbling around her flat having visions of or being haunted by (who knows which) her long dead husband. The few interesting and historical moments that actually focus on the important parts of her life as a political person occur as flashbacks. All I could say was why did they bother? I can't believe Streep did this movie, it could have been so much more interesting. SKIP IT.  On the bright side, there is STILL an opportunity for someone to make a good movie about the Iron Lady... this just isn't it. :)
B005HSL626|4.0|I didn't find any problems with this app. It's really fun and I highly recommend it! So buy it! You wont regret buying this game! I Promise!
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game is really awesome you should try. I love puzzles but have not played a bunch. you should try it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you're on the couch after a long day at work, trying to slow down your mind, this game is PERFECT.  keeps your attention but also lets you relax instead of tensing up. great find!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Free app that is great for kids and adults. Great to entertain the kids andfun for us older ones too :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a great way to pass the time. the controls are easy, and the game concept is easy, just how original video games used to be. the only thing i would add is some power-ups.

B004LROUW2|2.0|I really enjoyed the beginning half of this novel but as the second half went on (and on and on....) I got bored. Much of the inner dialogue was repeated across various chapters and some of the description were a bit too involved for my taste. Also, I did not feel the air chrysalis piece of the novel was resolved very well at the conclusion of the book.<br />I will try another of his novels based on other reviews here as I did enjoy his writing style in general especially the dialogue, I just believe it could have been about 200 pages shorter.
B003MC5N28|5.0|THE GIVER hardly needs commentary from me.  It's been praised up one-side and down another.  And yet I'm going to write a few more words.<br /><br />Lowry's writing in this book is delightful.  Her tone is calm and her word and grammar choice are simple, almost childish, which fits the principle character who is only 11 at the beginning of this book.  And yet it's the soft, light tone --which never changes as the story unfolds-- that makes the horror of the tale all the more real, all the more poignant when juxtaposed against the community's gentle nature.<br /><br />The Giver is written at the 5.7 AR level.  (Think 5th grade near the end of term).  There's no direct violence or bad language.<br /><br />Recommend.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/kidlit-YA blogger
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Great songs from a legendary woman, this cd is a pleasure to listen to.  I am really enjoying it, including the photos inside.
B0055PGUYU|1.0|Based on all the positive reviews, I was quite optimistic that this book would profoundly increase my insight into habits and how to alter them.  Instead, this was nothing more than a thinly veiled attemt to interweave stories that really have no basis being compared, contrasted, or integrated.  Anyone with an advanced degree, or a lot of common sense, will probably not benefit from reading it. Contrary to several reviewer's comments, the writing is not at all like other authors of the genre such as Malcolm Gladwell.  Waste of time and money.
B005UD1D62|4.0|I like all of Lauren Conrad's books, and I think this book is good, but it's not great. A good book for teen girls and a good beach read.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|Don't be fooled by the rating of this app. This is a stupid app. NER Brothers failed to make a clone of Mario Bros. STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!!
0749942169|3.0|This was a good book.  It was interesting in that the story is told mostly through the eyes of the spirit of Mom, Grace.  She has been badly injured in a school fire after she ran in to save her daughter Jenny, who was also seriously hurt.  While their physical bodies are being taken care of in a hospital burn unit, the \\"spirits\\" of Grace and Jenny follow family members around as they try to piece together evidence to determine who set the fire and why.  The main investigating is done by Grace's sister-in-law, Sarah, who is a police officer.<br /><br />This really came down to a story about the love we have for our families - Sarah trying to solve the murder mystery out of love for her brother and his family.  The Dad - working hard to keep his family protected.  And finally, Grace's spirit, with a decision she makes out of love for Jenny.<br />While the story was occasionally wordy and just a little lengthy, I did enjoy it.<br /><br />This is the second book that I have read by Rosamund Lupton and I would not hesitate to read any future books she may write
B0043RSE2M|5.0|We got this for an Easter present for our 9 year old grandson.  Even his parents (in their 40's) enjoyed it.

B005Q1W0ZQ|4.0|After getting hooked by the first season of Downton Abbey, which I watched from Amazon Prime, I ordered the DVD series and found it to be only slightly less captivating. Some of the events seemed more contrived, but the writers are probably running out of material. If the first season left you hanging, as it did me, then you must watch this also.
B0011AQLZQ|2.0|Great family movie, but terrible quality.  Read other reviews if you are interested in the actual plot.  This review is for the Amazon streaming video service for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.<br /><br />I am streaming from my PS3 to a 1080p 50\\" plasma tv for our family movie night.  Usually I love deep blacks, but the digital streaming version that Amazon is currently offering is WAY too dark.  The entire opening scene along with several other were so dark that as our family watched, we couldn't even see what was happening - Dumbledor [sp?] dropping Harry off as baby - Hagrid at lighthouse - any and all night scenes - forest scenes.  Understandably the streaming \\"HD\\" is nowhere near blu-ray, and for this price don't expect it.<br /><br />All in all, Amazon needs to invest in a new version of this movie to stream that doesn't have such a dark playback.  Should a \\"lighter\\" version become available for streaming I would gladly adjust my review and give 4 stars.  5 stars if they can get \\"HD\\" a bit closer to the blu-ray experience.  Rent/purchase at your own risk.  At this point I think we might just purchase the blu-ray, the streaming experience in its current state is just a waste of time and money.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is such a great game!  It so reminds me of my childhood!  Thanks for offering as a free app!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is awesome for killing some time in the early evening. I just zone out and move the rain drop around.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great brain teaser. I usually down load games for my 7 year old but I found myself playing it for hours .love it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is a very fun game to play just to relax. I love the music, and I like how it is challenging sometimes, but not necessarily hard.
0470913029|4.0|Hi, I have been asked to review the book which I purchased ...<br />Unfortunately I cannot comment accurately at this stage (have not started the diet in earnest yet), but I can give you my opinion of what I have read and how I relate to the book so far.<br />I like what the author says about how we should be eating ... we certainly have drifted far far away from real foods, since industrialisation and the advent of agriculture. Foods are produced in \\"bulk\\", and we eat far too much of certain substances. For example, how many olives go into making olive oil, or sunflower seeds. Salt and sugar, are things that we grossly over indulge in, and I can see how this impacts on our bodies and our health. I simply see it as this ... what you cannot pick off the tree or \\"catch\\", is mass produced, using far more ingredients than we would naturally consume (in the wild, or long long ago).<br />In modern day and age, things are far too easy go reach out for ... this ends up on our thighs and other body parts!<br />This books makes sense to me! It is a very informative and an easy to understand book, which conveys a feeling of, \\"I can do this\\"!<br />The other thing that I enjoy about the author, is that we are human, and we can \\"cheat\\" every now and again,as long as we stay aware, and this does not become the norm.<br />Whether I will succeed in sticking to the diet or not, remains to be seen ... I certainly hope I do, even if it takes longer than first anticipated!
1612130283|1.0|The most poorly written book I have ever read.  I am so sorry I purchased it.<br />The hype around the book, specifically on the \\"Today\\" show, was the reason I decided to give it a try.  It sounded edgy, fun, erotic, covering new ground.  Sadly, it was none of those things.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|easy to use and fun to play. great for all ages. its like frontierville on facebook. try it you might like it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|really like the simple concept. ease of controls and graphics are easy on the eyes. perfect to play in small amounts of time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game was added because I was bored.  This is a relaxing yet fun game. It is simple, yet complex. Thanks builders for a great game.
159514188X|5.0|This book totally changed my perspective on several people. You can for example see when you're in high school that some of the students are 'outsiders' and when I read the book, I started to think how all of these people at my school feel about them self. I started to just say hi to them with a hint of a smile, and as it turns out, they were and are very unhappy.  I'm a 14 year old girl, and I read the book when I was only 13. A lot of the people in my class are not mature enough to read the book. Anyway, I got my 50 year old teacher to read it and he liked it. The point is that everybody that are mature enough must read the book. It changes your mind,
B0055SWM08|5.0|Enjoying the puzzles quite a bit. The mechanics are easy to grasp and intuitive. The puzzles aren't very challenging through the first 3 stages, but they are enjoyable.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|simple,  but cute and a lot of fun with all the references to the original Oregon trail.  enjoying it s lot.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first two books. Couldn't put them down. I finished Mockingjay last night. Today, I still feel disappointed by the ending. I'm glad Katniss wound up with who she did, but did the author just get tired of writing the story?  It just dropped off at the end.<br />*Maybe some spoilers ahead...<br />In my opinion, the characters were too disjointed and inconsistent. There was not enough explanation of how Peeta still loved her in the end.  I'm glad he did, but how did he overcome what happened?  Why?  Katniss seemed so much more selfish and was portrayed so weakly so much of the time in this book.  Peeta's character was so changed, was missing thru so much of this book, which perhaps is because Collins was trying to get Katniss to stop taking him for granted.  But, it was so much sweeter in the first two books when Katniss had been falling for him because of his sweetness, because of his steady presence, in the face of horror.<br />The ending for Gale didn't fit either, and Prim?  Collins abandoned the relationships in my opinion.<br />How did Finnick do so well in training, the arena, and then instantly just melt down down in book three?  Then mentally perfect again in the Capital?<br />It was pretty depressing how many people we loved who died...  Yes, war is horrible, but this is a young adult fiction book.  If I wanted to lose myself in the horror of war without reprieve, I'd check out non-fiction war stories.<br />I keep trying to reach back to the first two books to get the feeling back when Katniss cared more about others in spite of her rough life circumstances...  To me, the power of these books was when Katniss and Peeta (together) were loving, sacrificing, winning, defying, outsmarting, challenging the evil, changing the evil, beating the evil, holding each other up, and the details of how they were doing it.  But the final ending, and so much of Mockingjay, lacked the intensity of the earlier books.<br />That being said...  I think Collins is a fantastic writer.  She definitely has a gift for weaving rich tapestries and making you feel like you are there.  She gets you to love the characters, even the less than perfect people.<br />I will give the first two books higher ratings than Mockingjay.<br />I definitely recommend getting all three books if you get the first. I went straight into each consecutive book.  I just wish Collins had given more intensity to the final ending, making us feel the love again between the two at the end.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Last week I checked my email account and I noticed that Amazon had sent me an email about the release of this CD/DVD. First of all, I didn't even knew that Miss Florence Welsh and her band had recorded an unplugged and second of all, considering how impressed I am about this girl's music and her \\"so passionate\\" talent to come up with AWESOME songs I got very, very excited about this record that I decided to buy it right away. I just watched the show on the DVD a couple of minutes ago and I can tell you now how IMPRESSIVE Florence Welsh's performance is.<br /><br />You must know that this isn't an unplugged where you'll listen too much of string arrangements, choir voices nor percussions all over the place in the effort of making the show works. On the opposite, here is more than obvious that the whole show sucess was put on Florence's shoulders and her AMAZING voice. The music you'll listen here just helps her to decorate the landscapes she draws in every song and this decision of letting her shine on her own was the smartest the people behind this show could've taken. When you listen to Florence Welsh singing in songs like \\"Drumming song\\" or \\"Never let me go\\" you understand that her voice is just a gift given to her from heaven. She's so capable to wrap things up in a moment that you just can't stop paying attention to her when she holds a note or when she articulates a word in the music language. Simply amazing. Here you won't find too many hit singles from her short but unmatched music catalogue (considering that she only has two studio albums) but the ones you'll find (Shake it out, Cosmic love -only on the CD- and Dog days are over) are executed with such passion and heart by Welsh that you'll start wondering which versions are better: the studio or the live ones. Talking about the covers, I really loved \\"Try a little tenderness\\" (Florence couldn't sing it better) but \\"Jackson\\" was more like a \\"favor\\" that Florence did to Josh Homme and not the other way around... in this song Florence just let him sing with her as she actually needed him.<br /><br />Something that really caught my attention and that impressed me as well was the fact that Florence was extremely shy during the whole show. If you pay attention she barely moves from the same spot since song 1 and she hardly ever looks at the audience because she seems to be so focused in what she's doing that she doesn't pay attention to anything else at all. Also, you can tell that she's not very comfortable talking to people when she's on stage either. When she thanks the audience or when she tries to say something about the place where she is, it's hard to understand what she actually says since she keeps her voice down. This just tells me that either she's still naive to deal with audiences (something so hard to believe) or she's just humble enough to see herself as a pop star or whatever (I'm sure she's not comfortable with those tags either). However you see it, watching her singing live in this unplugged is a delightful experience for sure. I really hope to see her live in a concert at least once. BTW, thumbs up to all those young boys and girls sitting in the front row. Their music taste is definitely amazing. Keep it up!... in this song Florence just let him sing with her as she actually needed him.<br /><br />Something that really caught my attention and that impressed me as well was the fact that Florence was extremely shy during the whole show.

B005NHQ2NY|4.0|The reading material is to the point and assisted me greatly to understand why certain things are essential while limiting my carb intake.<br /><br />I found the trouble shooting sections particularly handy as this provided real-life scenarios around slow weight loss and other issues one may have at some stage of the eating programme.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|Being a lifelong A's fan I was fascinated exactly as to how Brad Pitt (oops, Brapi playing A's general manager Billy Beane) rebuilt the team in 2002 and got them back into the playoffs after losing three key players (including 2000 American League Most Valuable Player Jason Giambi) to free agency from the 2001 playoff team using a sabremetric (basically, a unique statistical method of evaluating player performance) strategy dubbed \\"Moneyball\\" by the author Michael Lewis who wrote the book of the same name that the movie is based on.<br /><br />Now, if this sounds too much like fantasy baseball, it kind of is. So, if you're not a sports fan who is interested in the behind-the-scenes machinations of how players are drafted, how trades are made and the inner workings of a baseball franchise, this is probably not the movie for you. There are long stretches where it seems like a lot of talking is going on and not much game action.<br /><br />The actual game footage spliced into the movie footage works great. It does capture the thrill of the A's record 20 consecutive win streak during that season. Yet, like the book, the movie overlooks two major factors that have nothing to do with this Moneyball approach. Firstly, is although ex-Giants shortstop Royce Clayton plays that season's AL MVP Miguel Tejada, a holdover from the 2001 team, he's barely a footnote in the story onscreen. Secondly, the A's starting pitching troika of Mike Mulder, Barry Zito and Tim Hudson were huge in the A's 2000-2003 playoff run. In fact, they were arguably one of the best starting pitching staffs in recent MLB history. You do see Hudson a bit in the movie, but the other two are not mentioned at all.<br /><br />Also, there was a lot of artistic license as Jeremy Giambi and Carlos Pena end up being traded on the same day for dramatic effect. The reality was Giambi was traded on May 22, 2002, and Pena was dealt July 5. Also, when Pitt discusses picking up submarining relief pitcher Chad Bradford at his meeting with the team's scouts prior to the 2002, I half expected some scout to tell Pitt that Bradford was already on the team. The A's acquired him in 2001.<br /><br />The fictional Ivy League educated stat wizard Peter Brand (played brilliantly low key by Jonah Hill) in the movies joins the A's in 2002 as Beane's righthand man. The real-life Paul DePodesta, whom the fictional Brand is based on, actually joined the A's in 1999.<br /><br />Also, the movie seems a bit unfair to A's manager Art Howe (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Howe led the A's to three straight playoff appearances. He may have been old school but did he really butt heads that much with Beane over lineup choices? Maybe he did but how about giving Howe a bit of credit for that 20-game winning streak as well. I'm pretty sure some of his managerial moves helped that streak along.<br /><br />OK, that's the nitpicking as an A's fan. Moneyball is still a terrific movie in showing how a small market team with a very low budget could compete with the likes of the deep pockets New York Yankees et al. The search for undervalued players was spot on and how Beane faced off against the old school style of scouting and evaluating players. The hero of the movie, Scott Hatteburg, a catcher turned first baseman, did prove to be of good value and a bargain to boot. Yet like the book, the movie makes too much of a case that the Moneyball way of finding undervalued assets led to the A's success in 2002. Moneyball was just part of the winning formula as having an MVP (Tejada) and those three great pitchers were major factors in the streak. Still it's pretty compelling to watch the streak unfold on the big screen.<br /><br />The extras have a terrific behind-the-scenes look at how the movie was made with Major League Baseball's full cooperation in helping the baseball scenes in actual MLB ballparks look as real as possible right down to the era's uniforms. There's also a good discussion on the whole Moneyballtheory with Billy Beane adding his own insight.<br /><br />Lastly, for trivia buffs, you have got to love the framed Clash posters in Beane's office. Who wouldn't love a baseball GM into punk rock from his era?theory with Billy Beane adding his own insight.<br /><br />Lastly, for trivia buffs, you have got to love the framed Clash posters in Beane's office.

B004LDLI0S|3.0|I haven't been able to finish this.  I can only bear to read it in small doses.  It is hard for me to imagine how people fell under the spell of Hitler's unbelievable ego.  He starts with the premise that he is an infallible genius, the source of all truth and wisdomm.  Any pronouncements he makes must therefor be valid.  His followers must have been very naive and desperate.
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|This is straight up 1970's vintage soul music, revived in 2011. Charles Bradley has THE voice, simply amazing, so much power and soul. And his band is incredible, totally in the pocket. Daptone Records is becoming a no-brainer label, ie, if it's Daptone, it WILL be good. If you like 1970s soul and r&b, get this now. It's truly amazing, there isn't a bad song on here. You will not be disappointed!

B000KE1PIM|4.0|Pretty good rendition of the classic. Dobbin is superb, and many actors are wonderful in this series.<br />Beware of absolutely stinky music. Couldn't be worse, really. Well, maybe it's a toss between this one and soundtrack in the \\"Invincible\\".<br />Other than that, definitely watch it. Beats Reese Whitherspoon's mockery any day.

B0055SWM08|5.0|it actually is really fun. I think that it is a big improvement for kids who want challenges. I think that other people should play the game as well. it has its tough parts, but people need to suck it up and play the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is fast and a great read. Its very intense and a great series. I read all three which i highly recommend. I am not a big reader but with these books i read them all with in about a week and a half.

Please bring back the old &quot;Carousel&quot; and remove the sales junk from the home page!!!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I HAVE NO IDEA WHY ANYONE WOULDN'T GIVE THIS 5 STARS. A PERFECT 100 OUT OF 100. YES IT'S THAT GREAT! THE YEAR 1978 MADE ME PICK UP THE GUITAR AND THEN SEEING KISS AND ACE FREHLEY IN CONCERT IN 1979 ON THEIR DYNASTY TOUR MADE IT THAT MORE CONVINCING. I REMEMBER HEARING THIS ON THOSE LITTLE LUNCH BOX TAPE MACHINES! THEN FINALLY VINYL. THE FIRST FEW YEARS I WAS MAD CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT OR KNOW HOW TO EVEN PLAY A NOTE OF THIS CD BUT GRADUALLY LEARNED SOME OF IT. THE KEY HERE IS EDDIE. THE SOUND, SPEED, DIVE BOMB WHAMMY BAR AND HARMONIC TRICKS, AND TAPPING WERE ALL NEW AND YOU MUST CONSIDER THE TIME. HE EVEN USED A VARIAC TO LOWER THE VOLTAGE ON HIS MARSHALLS, AND MANY OTHER TRICKS OF THE TRADE, THAT NO ONE KNEW OF. EDDIE WAS VERY INTELLIGENT CAUSE HE KNEW HOW TO ACHIEVE HIS UNIQUE SOUND. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH EXCEPT THIS IS TIMELESS AND EVERY TRACK BURNS WITH EDDIE'S INCREDIBLE PLAYING OFTEN WITH A PHASE 90 FROM MXR. HE USED HIS EFFECTS INCREDIBLY. I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF MY FAVORITE SONG BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY.

B007ARJF6G|3.0|Madonna is a \\"Bad Girl,\\" who has done good with the release of, 'MDNA'. From the opening track, \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" to the closing track, \\"Falling Free,\\" she creates what one might come to expect from a Madonna recording.<br /><br />Madonna has created a dance pop orientated sensation, with frivolous spontaneity, all the while layering (at times) serious lyrical undertones delivered along hypnotic overdubs and computer generated beats.<br /><br />The influences for 'MDNA', seem to be culled from Madonna's earlier recordings. \\"I'm A Sinner,\\" for example, sounds remotely similar to, \\"Ray Of Light,\\" from the album, 'Ray Of Light'.<br /><br />On \\"Love Spent,\\" Madonna, samples from the song \\"Hung Up,\\" featured on her 'Confessions On A Dance Floor' album. \\"Hung Up,\\" prominently featured a sample from, ABBA's \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\".<br /><br />\\"Give Me All Your Lovin',\\" has a classic retro pop sound that captures Madonna's '80's style. She toys with her earlier work with lyrics such as \\"you could be my lucky star,\\" from \\"Lucky Star\\".<br /><br />There is some filler on the album. \\"Some Girls,\\" and \\"Superstar,\\" are unimpressive and mostly forgettable. Also, some may not Give A about the song \\"I Don't Give A\\".<br /><br />Though, I enjoyed and appreciated Madonna's 'American Life', F-bomb, I went with the clean version of, 'MDNA'. The purchase price for 'MDNA' (Clean) is also lower than the deluxe version.

B0076NAWWA|2.0|I was a bit disappointed to say the least. I have always liked Steve Morse and Dream Theater, so I was looking forward to this as a new release and band. Some decent playing and song structure, but rather bland overall. This could be appealing to fans who may have considered 10cc, Supertramp, early Styx or Kansas prog rock, back in the day.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Its OK.  I thought it would be a lot better with such good reviews.  Very typical puzzle game.  Nothing really neat or addictive about it to me
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a good boredom game. not too enthused about the constant app ads. but otherwise it is fun. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|I especially like this game because I can keep on playing it in attempts to get better scores. You have to think about what you should do each move because if you don't you'll not be able to complete the level. It isn't so hard that you fail a lot, but it's hard enough to be a good challenge. I recommend this very much.
1569242739|5.0|In Seattle there are many choices for purchasing high end cupcakes and I can honestly say that the two batches of cupcakes I made from this cookbook (the chocolate stout & the red velvet) were better than any I've ever had from any of these boutique cupcake shops.<br /><br />I made batches of both for my husband's birthday party and no one would have guessed that they contained no animal products and as the party was at a brewery, we handed out some extras to other guests and let's just say that one guy was so impressed he asked for my number. Really, they were that good, but I just followed the recipe (oh and I did give that guy an extra cupcake).<br /><br />Spoil yourself, your friends, your family and make some cupcakes from this cookbook, they really are memorable!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this miniseries as part of the Elizabeth Gaskell Collection as a way to own all three cheaply, but I definitely want a North & South box on its own if ever there's a blu-ray release.  You know Mr. Thornton deserves to be seen in HD.  The first thing that struck me when I saw it is how it reminds me of Pride & Prejudice, yet being very different at the same time.  Biased preconception, culture clash, botched proposal - these are the similarities.  But the similarities quite end there.  North & South happens in a grittier, more tumultuous and progressive era.  People actually have important things to do and conflicts carry graver consequences.  Margaret's a less endearing character compared to Lizzy, but interesting nonetheless. And Mr. Thornton can rival with Mr. Darcy any day.  It's dark and moody, and yet it's incredibly romantic.  I also like it that the heroine does the rescuing at the end of the day.  Big big plus.<br />I've since read the novel as well and I can say the adaptation actually elevated Gaskell's writing.  No offense to Mrs. Gaskell, but I sure as heck did not formulate such vivid images as seen in the show when I read her words.  I sometimes felt swept away inside a scene due to the beautiful cinematography and haunting scores.  There are several little romantic moments from the book I wish I could see, but I think the script did a really good job of cutting and adding where it did to enhance the flow on screen (The genius line \\"Look back, look back at me\\" wasn't from the book).
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a typical type, but they add some obstacles and abilities to keep it interesting.  The music and design are well done.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The final chapter in the 50 shades series.  This series went from very very kinky to more main stream romance with a bit of ropes and toys thrown in. Christian is tormented by his past living in the bubble he created with his overwhelming wealth and controlling lifestyle. When Ana comes into his life his world is turned upside down and he has to learn how to deal with things outside his control. Ana wants to work, she wants her own identity and living with a megalomaniac control freak is difficult, but she does an amenable job.<br /><br />This book is filled with one overwhelming problem after another. First Christian and Ana are being stalked by Ana's old boss, then her father is in a car accident then... well lets just say there is a lot of action in this one.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of mixed reviews about this book and a lot of people hated the writing thinking it was lame and redundant but I wonder how many of those people have actually ever picked up a romance novel before.  They are all pretty redundant, at least these books seem to have more going on than just kinky sex and a one dimensional mystery.  There are so many issues that come up, some because of money, some because of Christians past and some just because sometimes stuff happens in life when you least expect it.<br /><br />I appreciate the struggle that Christian has with his past, trying to learn to let go, and I felt that Ana's reactions were well written for a romance, because we all know it wouldn't be a romance novel if the two main characters broke up.  In light of that I think this was a well done series with a unique twist that hasn't really been explored much before. I'm also in love with Ana's inner goddess.  I love how she is always reading classic lit and tilting her glasses down her nose to roll her eyes at things or running around pumping her fists in the air.  I could so relate to that!

B0059XTUVI|3.0|There is no doubt that Meryl Streep embodied the spirit and facade of Margaret Thatcher. It is one of those remarkable performances that you are unlikely to forget. The real Margaret Thatcher, however, was left somewhere else. I got the point that she was a strong woman, opinionated and had a rough road to hoe to her position as Prime Minister, but the rest was left elsewhere.<br /><br />Streep's performance and that of David Broadbent, who plays her husband, Dennis, were the highlights of the film. The story is told in flashbacks and as we are told in terms of a demented, Margaret Thatcher. Not the best way to portray a woman of such substance. It is intimated that her son, Mark, was not and has not been a big part of her life. It was also intimated that Margaret Thatcher was not a big part of her children's lives. Not much was explained, it is all a perception. Much of what Margaret Thatcher went through as part of the House of Commons was also our perception. It looked like she had a great deal to overcome with her male colleagues, and the fact that she was the first Prime Minister is remarkable. That road in her life, needed much more emphasis.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gave such a superb performance, this was the film. She deserved the Academy Award for this performance.<br />That, however, is the film, and I expected so much more.<br /><br />Recommended for performance. prisrob 05-10-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003E7PZCO It's Complicated]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001R1B6YA Defending Your Life]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it had a whole bunch of games the games are awesome! u should get it this app
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I hate these apps that ask for real money in order to buy in game stuff.<br />I wonder how many parents buy these games for their children and lose tons of money overnight.  I can just imagine a parent flipping out and yelling at some poor child who didn't know any better.  But that is the business model that the producers of this game chose to make money off of.  it's sad
B00B5AAW52|5.0|I'm sure there are many reviews that you can find of Gilmore Girls but I just want to say that I haven't found a show that I have loved so much as this show and has made me feel so good.  I still look for a show that makes me feel as happy as Gilmore Girls has but have yet to find it.  It's not only heartwarming and at times heartbreaking but it really is one of the funniest (serious laugh out loud moments) and quirkiest.  Stars Hollow is a wonderful place filled with strange but loveable characters that I'm sure you'll also fall in love with.<br /><br />I really like this new box set.  For years I have had each individual season and have taken care of them.  Originally I was going to buy the \\"doll house\\" box set but I decided not to because of the price and the cardboard sleeves that might scratch the discs, and it might look awkward on my shelf.  The reason I really wanted the doll house is because it had all new complete updated guide to gilmoreisms (in the individual seasons the Gilmoreism guide is only in seasons 2, 3, and 4) but after much thought I decided I could live without it.  I really like this box set because it takes up less space.  Each season is only an inch and when they are all in the box you can just turn it and it only takes up less than 6 inches of space on your shelf.  What I love most about it is that all the seasons are the same size in nice plastic cases (discs still protected of course) instead of the outer paper/plastic inner cases.  Maybe it's just me but I hated that the first two seasons were quite bigger (though I realize those sizes kept a lot better and never broke) and seasons 3-7 were the same size but those had the horrible plastic things that were just taped on the binding and would never stay together. So this set doesn't have anything new sadly-same features as stand alone seasons, though I knew that beforehand.  The only thing that would have made this set is the complete guide to gilmoreisms like I mentioned before.  Oh well.  I really like this nice looking, clean set and so compact.  And it's a steal (at $64)!.  I really like this nice looking, clean set and so compact.  And it's a steal (at $64)!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Best free app i have got in awhile. so what if it reminds people of Mario. get it and play u wont be dissapointed.
0307592731|5.0|The type of book that you are torn between wanting to devour and wanting to put down so it doesn't end so soon. I loved this book so much that before I finished I had already bought a copy as a gift to a friend. I'm off to read her other book right now.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great and very addicting. I highly recommend. I love the graphics and the ease of moving through the levels
0345803485|5.0|I got the book in the mail today, and a few hours later, I am halfway through. A great well written story that keeps you wanting more. The characters are wonderful and this is a fantastic page turner! Can't wait to read the second, and third.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|On paper, this film must have appeared to be a tired contrivance-- so many cliches, so little to hold it together. Yet, somehow, after making films for 40 years, Spielberg continues to get better and better at what he does better than anybody else. One might say that the Spielberg film is a contradiction to the phrase \\"they don't make them like they used to.\\" Well, Spielberg does-- and in some ways better than anybody ever has. That isn't to say a movie like War Horse is going to offer new insights into the human condition, but it does breathe new life into the hopeful, sugar coated miracle stuff that Hollywood lives and breathes on.<br /><br />The images in this film are truly breathtaking. And, it should be said, they go beyond cliche and achieve poetry. It may be a kind of commercial poetry, but it is beautiful nonetheless. And though many of the situations feel fake (especially one with a sick child and her kindly grandfather), and some of the sequences just reek of manipulation, most of them work wonderfully. As much as I resisted, I teared up a couple of times. Cynics may disagree, but I think Spielberg has an extraordinary and authentic emotional sense-- and I choose to believe its genuine. The camera movement, the blocking-- the very conception of so many shots -- all function to communicate straight to the heart.<br /><br />Just contrast the simple emotion in this film to a much more famous-- but much more fraudulent film-- Forest Gump. Both films, of course, are wonderfully executed pieces of cinema magic. But while both are fairy tales, and both play upon our desire for wishes to come true, there's a big difference. In this film (like most of Spielberg's movies), the simple emotion comes from basic truths. People make fools of themselves, horses (and farms) get lost to the boss man and to war. Hard work means a lot but it doesn't always produce the desired result. But sometimes, you get back what you lose. Life isn't random, but it does spin off many colors. In Forest Gump, on the other hand, the meek not only inherit the earth, they also get to own their own conglomerate! And not only that-- those who work the hardest for change are shown up as fools. Thus, Forest Gump turns out to be based on a Big Lie -- the lie that Reagan sold to America-- that brains and creative thinking-- and daring-- were the road to death (Jennie) or disfigurement (Dan). Of course we know now that Reagan and his Big Lie actually destroyed the middle class-- and ruined our country. But Big Business keeps propping up the Reagan brand since his laissez-faire narrative made them rich at everyone else's expense.<br /><br />Spielberg's film, as mentioned before, is also a fairy tale. But it doesn't pretend (as does Forest Gump) to offer a new spin to a key decade in history. Gump is a travesty of the '60s-- and a slap in the face of real heroes like MLK and Robert Kennedy. War Horse's connection with WW1 is purely casual. This is not a film about a moment in time-- it is just a series of warm and fuzzy dreams that show us as we would like to be, and remind us that life is better when we are humble, kind, and a little brave. No-- we don't get Bubba Gump Shrimp company t-shirts or the Porsche that Bob Zemeckis probably drives around in. What we get-- and keep-- are our souls.<br /><br />So-- don't go see War Horse expecting a serious work of art (unless you accept Damien Hirst's definition of art as \\"anything done super well.\\") But do go if you want to experience Hollywood magic (for better or for worse) at its finest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game rocks I like it because you get to play lots of games in other games you just keep playing the game over and over and over.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Harkens back to an old gem from way back called something like Alabama Smith. Great logic game. Great for teaching the value of thinking things through.
0817439390|5.0|Bryan Peterson's book is a time-honoured and respected guide for aspiring photographers. I've done many photography courses, but the tips and techniques in this book were a revelation to me. The methods for improving your photos are described clearly and in the detail you need to try them out for yourself. A must-have for anyone serious about understanding their camera and taking better photos.
034537410X|1.0|This is total steal from YOGA NIDRA technique. The author studied it and then rebranded it as lucid dream. The author is a cheater. Does not have guts to title it as YOGA NIDRA.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|well written story with awesome plots that keep you at point, but horrible endingZ! The characters were consistent with the story!

B0073U2F12|1.0|bought this yesterday bc the previews lookd cool, when i started watching it i soon turned off the crappy 3d, and turnd on the 2d picture, wanted to see some 3d but first off this movie has the dreadful black lines on the top and bottom of the screen makin 3d watching so horrible to watch, just a crappy story,and crappy actors and doesnt tell you,how the aleins got here nor shows them beating them at the end, they just floated away in a sub. come on people and the aliens cant see you thru some glass, give me a break
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game will keep you entertained for hours on end. The puzzles are top notch. Just be careful, because the next swipe could very well be your last!
B0058WFO06|4.0|It's got all the things you love about Porcupine Tree without the Beatles Nouveau Shtick. Both discs are good on their own, but listening to them back to back gives the full experience!
B0076NAW48|5.0|Last week I thought the new Joan Osborne cd would probably be the best blues album I would hear in 2012. Well, maybe not. Chuck Leavell has punched out some of the most empathetic piano based blues I have ever heard. Chuck has listened to and understood the masters he plays tribute to here. Also the guitar playing and supporting musicians make this a totally fine blues album. 15 tracks and not a dud amongst them.  I am SO glad I got this.
0375842209|5.0|I am not yet done reading The Book Thief and I already feel compelled to write a review.  This book is one that I will long remember as being heartfelt and endearing.  I have perused some of the negative reviews and would like to suggest to those that are finding it a difficult and/or long read to listen to the unabridged audio version of the book.  The reader is outstanding and makes all characters authentic and believable.  I am listening to it now and have not felt once that it is long or slow or tedious.  Some have complained that it is another book about an orphan in WWII, but this book does not reflect the life of the Nazis or the Jews in Nazi Germany as is typical, but rather the lives of poor German citizens caught in this struggle.  This is a rare perspective indeed.  Though it is titled The Book Thief, the focus is not on stealing books but rather on those things that were \\"stolen\\" during this difficult time that were necessary for the characters to cope with their situation - stealing words, stealing a Jew, stealing a look at the stars. and stealing books, of course.  It is truly a journey I am enjoying, and will never forget.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are super easy and really fun. need more games like these on the andriod market. I love it
B0055SWM08|5.0|SO fun!! Very addictive! GREAT time killer. This game make you think about every move. Great exercise for the brain
B00753MBHA|5.0|This album is excellent from beginning to end, with the final track, The Galley, as one of the most epic songs the band has ever done. Personally, I still like Blood of the Nations slightly more, but this is still a solid, five star album from one of the best metal bands of all time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this will keep you busy and thinking. I've been playing this every chance I get. I don't know what else to say.
B0055SWM08|4.0|its good.  I like it but don't want to be forced to rate it after I've only had it for ten minutes.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is a turn based jrpg like the early Final Fantasy games.  If you're familiar with these from the SNES and Sega Genesis era of gaming then you know what you're getting.  It's fun and the story is well done.  I love the turn-based games because it allows me to pause as I go about my day without worrying that I'll die just because I've get distracted for a second.  I am going to look for others by this company and hope to find more like symphony of Eternity.<br /><br />I have a Kindle Fire, works fine.  Finished the game and have to say it was a lot of fun.  For the price that's a lot of hours of play time.  Definitely worth it.  Now I'll be looking for more of these turn-based RPGs.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell has an interesting and unique take on this kind of puzzle game (and the zen like music and raindrop effects is relaxing :) ). After playing for about an hour I've completed half of the visible levels (though there's a basement I can't scroll to yet) so it looks like maybe five hours of play time. Definitely worth a dollar.<br /><br />As to a previous poster, In the last hour I've noticed only one request to rate and it wasn't obtrusive or annoying in the slightest, so maybe that is fixed now. Worth a look, I think, especially if you like sliding box puzzles.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very cool calm addicting game. It's great for casual play, music is very calming too,  fits the game perfectly. Not too challenging but makes you think.
1400069181|3.0|I'm not a do-gooder and have no desire to be one.  I am an accountant so I tend to think with more of a business mindset.  In that sense, this book is helpful to anyone that wants to launch a new product, help a cause, do some good - yet still be able to earn a living.  There's great marketing advice, especially the chapter on how to be resourceful when you think you have no resources.<br /><br />Mycoskie's tone does get a bit arrogant, which I found annoying.  But if you can get beyond that, he writes in a way that really gets you to set aside the fear of just Starting whatever it is that matters to you.
B006OV6MCO|5.0|It was a good movie, arrived on time and in great shape. I hope this isn't the end of the road. Thrilling edge of your seat
B00028HBKC|1.0|A visually interesting comedy horror film. You'll laugh. You'll get spooked. Mel Gibson knows how to keep an audience engaged. And don't be put off by the subtitles. The plot and morality play are simple enough for any children's movie, which is what this is (think Brothers Grimm fairy tale).<br /><br />However, it was perhaps the most anti-semitic movie I've seen. While Jesus and the \\"good guys\\" all looked European, I suspect the makeup crew needed prosthetic noses to make sure all the Pharisees looked appropriately \\"Jewish.\\" And the Pharisees were straight out of \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\" Nothing but vitriolic stereotype. Apart from the funny parts--like when Jesus builds a table for a rich client or when he bungee jumps off a bridge--\\"The Passion\\" is just an update of \\"The Eternal Jew\\" from 1940.<br /><br />Along with B-movie Sci Fi, creature-features and your favorite zombie classics, \\"The Passion\\" is a great film for that Halloween \\"Fright Night\\" movie marathon at home for the kids (where's MST3K when you need them). For adults, it is the ultimate movie drinking game. Take a shot every time Jesus is hit. Seasoned alcoholics won't be able to make it through the first half hour. Cheers!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This show keeps you on the edge of your seat & leaves you wanting more! Jessica Lange is brilliant as the woman next door. There are twist and turns you never see coming! Watch it..it WILL make you look twice before entering your basement! One of the most fun to watch tv shows ever!
B000002J09|5.0|Good remaster and worth the price. This remaster is a significant improvement over the earlier CD release with no harshness in the treble as is so often the case with RIAA equalized recordings. The sound is crystal clear with a wider and deeper sound stage than the older CD. The drums have good snap but are limited in depth and do not thunder on down to a floor shaking 20HZ. There is good rhythm and pace in this recording and it sounds fresh, clean and uncongested with reasonably good dynamics especially given that it is vintage 1970's recording. ZOZO (Led Zeppelin 4) is a classic rock album and you will be hard pressed to beat this recording.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found this book as addictive as the past two yet towards the end there is a sense that the author rushed the ending, left too many loopholes, lacked the depth of character as the other two books and seemed incongruent with their personalities. More detailing of events towards the end would of been appreciated instead of what felt like a grey quick run through of events instead of the vivid imagery that Collins has been able to offer in her past books.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone yet have them lower their expectation. Trilogies rarely have an Ending that ties everything together.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Well done remaster but not mind blowing. The sound is crisp, and crystal clear with no harshness in the treble as is so often the case with RIAA equalized recordings. I have a 1994 CD of the same and there is a significant improvement in sound quality so at this price point I can make a solid recommendation that you buy this timeless classic milestone in Rock.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|i think there should be a free version  free free free free frrree free free free free free free free free free free free
B003B96AOW|5.0|As a collector of Deadpool figures this one is definitely in my top favorites. Looks great on my shelf. Must have for any collector.
B007P3TMW2|4.0|Started a bit slow, most of the flash backs could have been dropped, but maybe not, depending on your taste.  The kid was better than real.  The characters were all believable, and best of all, it started a discussion that was enlightening.  Probably something that also could be used in a civics or ethics class.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is simply amazing way better than the old school Oregon trail I used to play in fourth grade in the nineties
B0071MV540|4.0|The movie was clean fun to watch and enjoy.  The couple of twists were not anticipated to far in advance.  Liked the fact that there was no gratuitous sex, swearing, and violence.  Something a family can share with the kids, even us old folks.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I've always enjoyed John Grisham's book, and I wasn't disappointed with this one!  It didn't have as much \\"intrigue\\" as I'm used to with his writing, but it more than made up for it with the interesting characters and story line.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you love passion and true love in a sort of controlling way the 50 shades trilogy is for you.  I hated to see the story end.  It was great!  Very touching in the end.  You will enjoy it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is sooo cool ... i use it alll the time...  you got to get it..  you will love it. you can even high light and copy and paste.. i will never delete this app. and its free...!!!!
1612130283|5.0|I give this book 5 stars.  It is the beginning of a great love story after you get past some parts. You need to read all three books to really enjoy where this book takes you to.
0545259088|4.0|Ahh I have read about the dreaded ending in many reviews and I have to say the same thing. It is way to open ended. I think she should have given up some of the first chapters to make more final chapters.<br /><br />This book was ok, the beginning kind of dragged on and nothing really happened because with no Grace there is no Sam. We all know that. I was really glad when the book picked up and coming closer to the end I couldn't wait to see what happened. I'm really glad what we thought happened at the end didn't happen though. My heart sank and then soared within two chapters. haha<br /><br />The ending...so much left unsaid. What about Cole and Isabel? What about Sam and Grace? Like I said I really wish she could have added more chapters.<br /><br />Dissapointed!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book you must continue on.  This is even better than book one.  I loved every minute of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent read.  The book has great characters and is fast paced to keep the reader interested.  Hard to put the book down once you start reading.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Ham and eggs, salt and pepper, Holmes and Watson. Some things just naturally go together. Yes, our intrepid tag team is back to a sooty, soiled London, with ever more outrageous plots and counter-plots, wry asides, hairbreadth escapes and goofy disguises. Once again we see Holmes' slow-motion mental preview for the next bout of fisticuffs before we see it unfold in blinding speed, exactly as planned.<br /><br />This time Professor Moriarty makes his debut in this series, so we're talking world domination here, not just Jolly Old England. Naturally we recognize faces from the 2009 film and the audience laughs when they appear.<br /><br />Once again Guy Ritchie (\\"Sherlock Holmes\\") directs:<br />  * Robert Downey Jr (\\"Iron Man\\") returns as our dauntless detective, doing his darnedest to derail that infernal wedding! (...and save the world.)<br />  * Jude Law (\\"Hugo\\") is, once again, his faithful sidekick, Dr. John Watson, who is Holmes' equal in every way, it's just that he wants to get married.<br />  * Noomie Rapace (\\"The Millennium Trilogy\\") introduces Sim, an ingenious fortune-telling gypsy, trying to locate her brother.<br />  * Rachel McAdams (\\"Midnight in Paris\\") returns as Irene Adler, an important woman in Holmes' life.<br />  * Jared Harris (\\"The Ward\\") is Professor Moriarty, one of fiction's best nemeses. He and Holmes share a mutual admiration for each other that adds to the fun.<br /><br />Sometimes things just get too, too cute, and the \\"bromance\\" between Holmes and Watson has them dancing together, almost kissing, and Holmes is clearly jealous when faced with the idea of Watson getting married. How would Sir Arthur Conan Doyle feel about this? I'm just sayin'...<br /><br />Personally, I appreciate the women in this series: they don't trip while running in the forest or need a strong man to save them, we find them serious, resourceful and focused. Of course with this being a Guy Ritchie film, they also know martial arts!<br /><br />Remember, we're talkingworld domination, so you may expect gunshots and some blowie uppie stuff; for the most part, this 129-minute PG-13 comedy keeps us entertained and we never have to cover our eyes. Whew!<br /><br />But this is another one where you absolutely MUST suspend disbelief! That's elementary, my dear....smile...
B0055SWM08|5.0|We'll designed. Challenging and fun.  Great attention to detail on the graphics.  For those that love chips challenge, you will like this game.
B00417HUV0|3.0|As a Twisted Sister fan, I'm just going to come out and say it:  this CD is not their best music, although I still enjoy listening to it. By now, it is common knowledge that this is not really a Twisted Sister album.  Think of it as more of a Dee Snider solo project.  According to stories on the internet, the only way the record company agreed to release this CD was to force it to be released under the Twisted Sister name.  It is not clear if any other members of Twisted Sister actually played on this CD.  To give you an idea of what the band thinks of this album, just try to find a Twisted Sister live show that contains any of these songs.  The music on this CD sounds nothing like the Twisted Sister that created the Under The Blade, You Can't Stop Rock and Roll, Stay Hungry, or Come Out and Play albums.  The CD was produced by Beau Hill who produced many RATT albums and the sound of this CD is very similar to RATT in that it is geared to the pop style of metal which is a major departure from the other Sister releases.<br /><br />With all of that said, I still play the CD and somewhat enjoy the music.  There is something about the tempo that makes it good background music and therefore keeps me listening.  \\"Love is for Suckers\\" and \\"You are all that I need\\" are the best of the bunch.  The extra tracks sound exactly like all of the other songs on this CD (filled with tempo and a pop-style chorus.)
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I have read all of her books AND THEY ARE GREAT, HOWEVER THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT IN A GOOD WAY. SHE TAKES YOU THROUGH ALL THE STEPS AND IT IS TOTALLY WONDERFUL...IT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE IN SO MANY WAY...THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU....
B0063IH60K|5.0|I found this game easy to use and quick to play.  Perfect for those times when you are waiting for someone or only have a few minutes to spare.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Saying this book is amazing is the understatement of the year. Many people will probably shy away from this book because it focuses on a video game that has taken over everyday life in this time period but please do not make that mistake. This book has everything. Puzzles, suspense, romance and its references to classic movies, games and songs makes you want to go watch, listen and play them all over again. It is a must read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|First review I've been asked to write and actually wanted to. Excellent game! Please continue developing more! Also, beautiful art style.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book reveals the real story about what this nasty war is really about.<br />The author puts you right in the story.  It clearly shows the kind of men it takes to fight this kind of a war.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I enjoyed the recording and the idea that he worked with such an eclectic group of young artists. Great sound; clear and beautiful.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game plays a lot like Mario bros.  Good free game definitely worth buying. Quit reading this and get it already.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have been looking for a good book to read for a few weeks. Why did I wait so long to read The Hunger Games???  Excellent book, would recommend over and over.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game more loosing games than winners, at least in my case anyway. can't really think of anything more to add to it.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Stalingrad picks up where Blood of the Nations left off and shows what talent is all about.  Stalingrad is Accept's best work to date.  This album is definetly guitar oriented.  Wolf Hoffman soars and his solos are plentiful.  Mark Tornillo sounds much stronger and more confident here.  There are many times that his voice sounds like Udo's back in the glory days.  The songs on Stalingrad are very diverse, from classic ballads such as Shadow Soldiers to modern metal speedfreaks like Flash to Bang Time.  Get this album and go see them on tour!
1934429821|5.0|Charley Harper is a great illustrator to enjoy and learn from. This lower cost edition of the book (the full size edition sells for about $120 on Amazon, discounted from $200) will have to do for the likes of me. But, though small and rather cheaply made, it is a treasure. So, five stars for Harper and Todd Oldham, one star for the publisher. The binding is so cheap that through brand new, it arrived broken. I don't blame Amazon's shipping department for this. Still, those complaints aside, I am happy to have a wide sampling of Mr. Harper's best work.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|tons of fun love the game addictive. wish you didn't need the wiring to play. but great game for sure
B006OCM0G0|5.0|A highly creative &amp; addicting game. Its hard to put down once you start by making tons of friends &amp; leveling up. I give this game a huge thumbs up and I highly recommend it. :)

B006M4F67A|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MAH JONG apps I have played.  Not only do you have a various games to choose from but your play to improve your own time.  Challenging and satisfying.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game I just wish there was a faster way to earn energy than every three minutes but I guess it makes me put the game down
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game, runs super smooth! Music is pretty good too. Keeps my brain active, I love it! Even better I got it for free
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great second book to the Hunger Games trilogy!! This will keep you reading and wanting to get to book 3!!!  Read on!
B007Q476KU|5.0|This is a movie that is great to watch with the family. A great movie on courage and it's many forms. It shows the bonds forged between amanand his beast and the hardship both have to suffer through in war.  This movie captures you with out you knowing and will put a tear in your eye by the end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|always liked this game. no crashes no bad things at all. if you liked playing this game, it definetly takes a small piece of boredom out of your busy schedule.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game is very fun and gorgeous on Galaxy Tab 10.1. Highly recommend this game! Plenty of levels and graphics are nice. Very relaxing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive game once I got started couldn't stop playing I normally don't care for puzzle games but i saw the great reviews that this was getting so I gave it a try glad I did
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Great show good value DVD are at over $50 for a full season I bought them all. And commercial free
B0025KVLV0|3.0|I bought this because I want to save on shipping fees. But I still expect it will be good. It's good, but there's no lyrics coming with it, which it's a little bit disappointing.
0439023513|1.0|In the aftermath of the movie director not signing up for the sequels inspite of the overwhelming success of the movie, people wonder why.<br /><br />After reading the second and third book, I realized why. The source material is such a foul well to draw on for the movies. Gary Ross was wise not to tackle such garbage.<br /><br />Book 3, Yuckingjay, is such a waste of time. Don't even bother driving to the public library to borrow this, much so spend money on it.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins should have just sold her soul to the devil like JK Rowling.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really tests your decision making abilities. Provides hours of entertainment. I really regretted not getting this a month or so ago when it was the free app of the day and was e cited when I saw it was being offered again.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is a very entertaining game but the only that gets on my nerves is the constant loss of energy.It seems like after I'm done with collecting my money and chopping my trees I'm out of energy.Other than that,its quite enjoyable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It gets addictive and intense!!! No bugs on Kindle Fire works perfectly. I love it, I say get it it's worth it!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is similar to frontierville or otherg<br />ames on facebook. I like those games so I enjoy this one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is not what I thought it would be like. However it has been so much fun reliving the Oregon Trail!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Lots of fun and very easy to use. Love that it is a free app. Don't wait...download it today. :-)
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is wonderful in every way.  The puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly so,  the music is peaceful,  and the graphics are beautiful.  I was on the fence with this one for awhile, but when it became the faotd I had to get it.  I will be purchasing the second one as soon as I finish this one.
B0063IH60K|3.0|ok just slow.when playing cards graphics ok.  card options are minimal but are standard. would recommend this game but it could. be better
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario Bros gone Irish! Side scrolling game that requires you to use your Irish pal to jump over bugs, collect coins, break question mark boxes, and collect three leaf clovers to recoup your life! Tons of fun and on the kindle fire easy to control!
B005TKD8ZK|4.0|This is a beautiful book about a man's need to run.  The book is gentle and totally unassuming, and highlights the very personal nature of running that I can recognize, as a similarly late-starting, though significantly less accomplished runner.  It's the sort of book you will keep and reread from time to time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a fun strategy puzzle game I enjoy playing.  there are a lot of levels of play to keep it interesting and to slowly ramp up the difficulty.  nice audio too.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|This was my first coldplay album and I love it! Especially \\"Paradise\\", definitely one of the best alternative rock songs out there! They're my favorite band now!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Soothing as a soul massage in a world of silk and velvet oneness... don't be afraid to be drawn in and released by your inhibitions. Just be and be less.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Extremely entertaining and is very easy to control.  If you like puzzle games you'll love this.  It's very calming and relaxing to play.  Buy it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun way to spend a little time and workout your brain. Challenging puzzles that are fun to do. Nice soothing music too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First, let me say this is the first review I have ever written.  EVER.  But since lately I rely on other's reviews before buying just about anything, I thought I should share for the opportunity to some that may read it, how this book/series affected me.  For me, this is the first book that I have read in a long time that can balance on the fine line between being \\"deep\\" and trying so hard for depth that it's borderline ridiculous.  For the most part, I will enjoy a story but find it either very light and basic or the author is so desperate to create something \\"different\\" that it winds up not making sense.  (Should anyone be reading this and knows what I'm talking about, they are probably clicking to buy the book before even reading the rest of my review!)  What Collins has done in this book is the reason why I don't write-not many people can effectively achieve this.<br /><br />Summaries of the book can be found everywhere, so I won't go too far into it, but there is a line in the book that sticks with me.  Peeta says he is trying to find a way to show them he is more than just a piece in one of their games. It seems both this book and from what I have read into the rest of the trilogy the main part of the story centers around this idea, for at least the main characters, anyway.  What I found the most interesting was everything the book left unsaid.  If you are \\"with\\" the auther on her ideas you are given enough information to form your own answers about what is really going on.  As Katniss is trying to figure out the reasoning for everything that happens to her and the world of Panem, the reader is also in need of figuring out her perspective and sometimes, a perspective that she doesn't see.  Suzanne Collins, I can 100% appreciate where you were going with this book, and I'm with you!<br /><br />Now, if you are not able to pick up the message I have been talking about, you will still most likely enjoy the book very much, and not feel that you are missing out on anything.  As everyone seems to be saying, it is very well written with cliffhangers at the end of every chapter.  It keeps you moving forward and engaged.  Yes there is a bit of gore and there were a few times I was disappointed that the romance intensity did not pick up whatsoever, but I have to remember, the story is following the path the author has chosen, not what I would like to read.  So anything extra will just have to exist in my imagination!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|get the game it is so fun come on people and it is for free just get it it is so fantastic
B0055SWM08|5.0|This puzzle game is everything a touch screen puzzle app should be. The use of colors and screen space is wonderful, making everything easy to see and use. The level design starts very easy as a person learns the game, but steadily increases in difficulty as the game progresses, making it a challenge even for puzzle veterans.<br /><br />The game's art direction is very much in keeping with the them of pushing around rain drops. Understated with a darker color pallet without losing access to other colors. It does give a feel for the time period set in the game level system (late '30s to early '40s). Subtle details like puzzle background changing seasons over the stages as if progressing through the level's year make the game all the more alluring. The sound is like the soft acoustic music that I like to play on rainy days.<br /><br />A very engrossing puzzle app that is a must have!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best it keeps you entertained with a bunch of different games I recommend it tod people all ages
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A fantastic look at a family crisis through an unconventional perspective - the family dog! I would highly recommend this to anyone!
0440178002|5.0|\\"Shogun\\" by James Clavell is an exciting novel that takes place in Japan in the early 1600s. The main character of the book is John Blackthorne a pilot of the ship Erasmus that is sent by England and the Netherlands to plunder Spain and Portugal's possessions in the New World and to open trade in the Pacific Ocean. The ship that John Blackthorne is piloting is shipwrecked in a storm off the coast of Japan and that's how he and his crew end up there.<br /><br />The book goes into great detail in describing John Blackthorne's culture shock in Japan. He finds out about the strict rule of the daimyos. He's horrified by the custom of ritual suicide called seppuku. He comes close to falling in love with his interpreter Mariko and strikes up a friendship with the daimyo Lord Toranaga in whose territory he is residing in and learns about how the ultimate goal of Lord Toranaga and the other daimyos is to receive the title of Shogun (supreme warlord) from the Japanese emperor.<br /><br />At the time John Blackthorne is in Japan, Roman Catholicism has been introduced and many of the daimyos are Catholics. Blackthorne is a Protestant since he is English and he is greatly bothered by the spread of Catholicism in Japan. I'm actually a Protestant myself, but Catholicism doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Although the tyrannical rule of the daimyos shocks John Blackthorne, he notices that the Japanese have a much more efficient system of sanitation than his native country England, so the book sends out the message that the bad qualities of a culture are offset by the good ones.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|This was one of the best videos we ever bought for our kids.<br />They never get tired of watching Toy Story and we don't have<br />to worry about them scratching the disc.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is something that can keep you entertained for quite a while and is pretty fun.  I enjoyed playing it and Robt regret downloading it.
B000FC1AOI|5.0|I read this back in 2008 because I wanted to watch the movie. I know books are always better than the movie. I hated the movie A LOT. The book made me laugh so hard...but when I watched the movie, I just got pissed off.
1400069289|2.0|Once again the American publishing industry pushes out a too-long book that would have easily been a nine-page essay in the Atlantic monthly. Rather than an expert in the field, again we have a journalist who compiles a bunch of facts and stories and massages it into the standard creative-writing-program story-expand narrative framework. The book is big on promise, short on execution, and dishonest in exposition.<br /><br />The first part concerns some basic behavior psychology with a focus on the Cue-Routine-Reward cycle. This is somehow the miraculous discovery that will change your life. However, the book is so bereft of application for individual users, that you end of reading a bunch of nice stories about how other people changed, but still lack any methodology about how to apply it to yourself other than asking, \\"Hey, what are your cues?\\", \\"What reward does your habit give?\\".<br /><br />The author is exceedingly dishonest in trying to massage Paul O'Neil's turn-around of Alcoa into an example of habit forming. It is an excellent example of expertise in organizational behavior, however it is only tangentially related to habit formation. Habit formation of individuals is a neurological mechanism, habit formation is organizations is a multi-factor process dealing with organizational structure, power sharing, organizational goals, and individual management styles, thus the author is disingenuous when he links the two \\"habits\\" through equivocation.<br /><br />Overall, this was not worth the purchase price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honesly i dont know why your reading this review. you know you want to buy this book. im sure you have heard how amazing it is a hundred times.<br />so just go back buy the book and have fun reading it if your anything like me you wont want to put it down!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|wonderful game really keeps u thinkin. keep more games like this commin;) can't wait till the next one comes out:) &lt;3
1612130283|1.0|Cannot believe some people gave this a five. It isn't even literature. I am a prolific reader and I have to say this is the worst book I've read. Finished only in hopes there would eventually be a story!<br />One star only because this review page would not allow me to go on without one.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I enjoy getting my favorite man friend something special for his Birthday/Christmas. I usually try to find something pertaining to golf. This is a very good movie and I know he'll be surprised.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautiful game with beautiful, soothing music. I play Quell often because I like the challenge of figuring things out. The graphics look 3D and are rendered in lovely, muted colors. Each level has four, new layouts. I have played five levels so far, and will feel a bit bereft when I've completed this game.  I highly recommend this wonderful game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Works. Fun puzzle game. Don't need to say much else. But there is a 20 writers minimum.  So I guess you could pass some time with this app.
0307272702|5.0|It's time for a revolution, to get back to the time when we knew how to eat and we were eating what it was healthy for us and not what is healthy for the economy or some persons' reputation.<br /><br />This book shows us the way to do it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This ice age game works smooth.  The built in cartoons in the i game movie theater are a plus.  Gameloft rocks.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent weather app, gets the job done with an appropriate amount of extras without feeling bogged down. would recommend as my first choice in weather apps on the kindle.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Very well put together puzzle game.  The graphics have a pleasant style. The background music is very relaxing, but not to the point of putting me to sleep. The difficulty of the puzzles, so far, is scaling up just enough in difficulty to be challenging, yet not frustrating.<br /><br />Definitely worth the low price if you are into puzzle type games!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is really fun. I like to save up the credits I earn and buy the red laser and max out the strength of it. If you max it out all the way, it shoots 3 red lasers at a time and at a faster pace.<br /><br />On an unrelated note, I'm not sure if it's a case of fat fingers but sometimes I accidentally pause the game somehow.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game runs smooth, easy to complete, and has a calm/relaxing theme playing in the background.  There are no intrusive permissions from what I have seen.<br /><br />Most people reviewing say they are being bombarded with messages to rate and like on facebook...  Odd as I have yet to see these...  Maybe because I don't have a facebook account?<br /><br />Droid X2
B0055SWM08|4.0|Works great on the charge! No issues so far! Doesn't slow down the phone or freeze! Great for my son to learn about strategy as well!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've been waiting to get this as the FAOTD and yesterday was that day. Graphics and music are great!  One of the better apps. love it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this trilogy to use on the kindle software I downloaded for my laptop, and it worked brilliantly. As for Suzanne Collins' work; it's some of the best I've ever read, I highly recommend it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this app it is the best EVER!!!!! and it is FREE!!!!! thank you NER brothers for creating this app and all u negitive people....be nice!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Enjoying this game. It's addictive and quick to play.  It forces you to think ahead and plan your moves.  Good for my kid's minds as well.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Arrived promptly, excellant movie, was very pleased as the movie lived up to all it's previous advertising. Somehow I ordered two DVDs, will give one away to family member.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't read the book but i did see the movie and it was really good and it shows you life lessons responsibilitys and most important what will happen if we don't take care of<br />the world better. Anyways this book is about a girl named kattness and she was chosen for the the hunger games which is one boy and one girl from each district who fight for there life
B0055SWM08|5.0|just a spectacular game.<br />gets you think before you make a move.<br />get this game now, you won't regret it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love the game, only problem is energy so it is not a play for hours game but play every so often.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I think this album is great. The took the uniqueness of Puscifer, but Maynard went back to using the voice that everyone loves. This in combination with the vocals of Carina Round just made a perfect album.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game had it on my phone now on my kindle fire kids like it too thumbs up<br /><br />!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is a great app and is a good and quick working application I just wish it was faster than what it is
B002R88G4U|5.0|Right from its unlikely title this book will captivate. Written in the form of correspondence, each letter brings revelations, observations and snippets of information as new characters and twists are seamlessly introduced and developed.<br />A great read with an original subject. I loved it!
B0067R0APK|3.0|Okay app but it bugs me when they beg for a review.  It thrrew me off at first when I found the persistent link in notifications but it is convenient to check the current conditions without having to back out of whatever you are doing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really love this game! It is great for the entire family!!! I think people of all ages will enjoy it as me, my mother, my 14 yo, my 11 yo and my hubby all play it!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun enjoy able app.  Very relaxing. Passes time well. Would like more like it.  Totally like this app. Yeah yeah
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|This show has been widely traded in bootleg circles is given an official rel;ease. Its David Bowie at his Ziggy phase. Backed by an excellent band, Bowie plays his hits very close to the studio versions which he didnt do much after this. Bowie is in strong voice and the audio quality of the disc is very good. The set list is like a greatest hits as Bowie was the biggest rock star in the world at this point. This disc is great for the long time Bowie fan and also those unfamiliar with his work. It is more staight up rock n roll than his other live releases. (David live and Stage). Both of those lps are also very good, but they dont rock as hard as this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Good game. Need version for phones. Need ways to earn dollars without spending real money other than that its a good game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great! I absolutely love it! It definitely reminds me a little bit of Mario Bros., but who doesn't love that game? When I was a kid, I played Mario Bros. all the time (on the original Nintendo) . I had soooooo much fun! Lep's World reminds me of fun times with my family when I was a child. That right there is enough to give it 5 Stars for me! However, the controls are easy to operate and it's just challenging enough so that it's not to hard. I also want to mention that it's FREE! I would definitely look at more apps from NER Brothers!  Thank You for a fun entertaining app!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a blast. Once you start you wont want to stop. Great fun for all ages. love that it was a free game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I rarely find Apps that even worth reviewing but this one is fun, well designed and quite addictive. Good job on this, Dev. I will be looking at more of your releases.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|if you like to spend some time on a game this is the one for you. I really enjoy this game quite a lot.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Runs great on the Epic 4G. Smooth screen changes and very nice graphics.  Downloaded it and wound up playing for 30 minutes before i knew it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I admit I held out as long as possible before reading this. I'm not into the young adult genre after my accidental experience with Twilight. I actually bought Twilight before all the mayhem and didn't realize it was a YA until I started reading it. Don't get me wrong I didn't think it bad, just a little too teenagy for me but I do love the movies and story!! I gave YA another go as The Hunger Games seemed a good bit edgier and I'm glad I did. Saw the movie in mid read and that made the experience even more enjoyable. Great girl power story, too. I imagine I would have been quite obssessed if I had read this as a teenage girl!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Good game play but unplayable after a short while due to no energy for your guy to perform actions. game wants money every few minutes to the tune of $1 per ACTION totalty insane.
B00005KARK|5.0|I bought this DVD for my youngest granddaughter who just turned one (1).  She loves cartoons & DVD's now, plus her dad likes for her to get the \\"old\\" stories that he remembers so well.  I'm sure this one was a winner!!!<br /><br />Sue
1609611543|5.0|ReAlly informative and convincing that today's wheat isn't good for you even if you're not gluten intolerant or have ciliacs disease. Worth really if you're serious about loosing weight and having better health.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|I expected this movie to be really good since I like Leo,but it was really boring. Thought that it would be more interesting.
0385344228|2.0|I can't care about a book unless I care about at least a few of the characters.  I didn't feel empathy for any of the primary characters in this book and as a result, I finished it just to see if Jacob was the murderer.  I won't read anything else by this author.
B0055SWM08|5.0|another fantastically addictive game. one of the best to come along.<br />worth every penny<br />easy to learn and progressively harder. you will spend time trying to beat your scores
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great! Its always nice to know the weather at home even if you're not there. I really have no complaint with this app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's all just trial and error with rewards when you finish a level perfectly. Great fun for those that like puzzle games. And it works awesome on my kindle fire.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game.  Relaxing fun.  Nice graphics and sounds.  Very subtle and effective.  Good balance of challenge and difficulty that keeps you coming back for more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Downloaded it and haven't been able to put it down since! Highly recommended and works great on mytouch4g.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is challenging enough to be fun, and yet mellow enough to be relaxing. It has quickly become one of my favorite Android games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game will be addicting for anyone who enjoys puzzles. Graphics look great and the soundtrack is soothing. Restarts once in a while but that might just be my phone.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love this app and the graphics are great! recommend this app for anyone of any age. Easy to use and full of great things to explore.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This second book of The Hunger Games Trilogy had the suspense and thrill of the first one. It is a must read but, the third was better again.  I couldn't leave it down and as soon as I had finished I bought the third one.  So sad I'm finished all three.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The graphics, game play, and frame rate are all great on the Kindle fire. Introduces th basic concepts well and has a lot of variation.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a puzzle game that has just the right difficulty. The enjoyment is enhanced with wonderful graphics. I recomend this game for anybody that wants to kill some time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the game is excellent but I bought this when it was .99. I could have saved a buck. ;) blah blah blah.
B001E45XT4|5.0|At first I was worried about getting the headset for the cheap price they were selling it for, but I received it at the earliest possible time and the product was in perfect condition, working great too.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|this game should have more worlds and levels.<br />But its the rummest angry birds game yet. THIS GAME IS AWESOME!
B001TODO54|5.0|I know a lot of people who had problems with this book, but most of that stems for messages they believe the book is trying to convey to readers. People seem to think this book is anti marriage, but I disagree. The main character Katsa, does not believe in marriage and does not want to be told to do something and thinks that marriage will take away her freedom. But I think its important to keep in mind the books setting. The book does not say that marriage is awful and that you should not get married, but that for the main character, Katsa marriage is not what she wants in life.<br /><br />The fact that Katsa has such powerful beliefs is what makes me love her as a character. She is strong, independent, smart, and caring. So she doesn't want to be married or have kids, thats her decision and she never tries to tell anyone else that they are wrong to want to get married or have kids. She just doesn't want to for herself.<br /><br />This book is wonderfully written with great characters and I hate to think that there are readers out there who will not read this book because some people think this book is too controversial. Read this book before you make up your mind about what message you think it's trying to convey. I fell in love with this book immediately after reading the first few pages and even know all I want to do is reread this book. Seriously go read it. Now!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love this movie! I was able to get it cheaper on Amazon than by going and buying it in town. It took awhile for it to get to me, but I wasn't in a big rush so it wasn't a big deal. It came shrink wrapped so I knew that I was getting a brand new DVD. I haven't had any problems with it, and I look forward to enjoying it for a long time to come.
B0053TMP24|5.0|If you liked the Percy Jackson series then you are going to fall in love with this book too. I wasn't a huge fan of the first book in this new series because I felt it was just in the original series's shadow, however this book completely changed my opinion. I can see where this new story line is going and love the new characters. The only bad part is the end and having to wait so long for the next book to come out!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this os an awesome game! y'all need to get it and I bet you'll enjoy! this game is a lot of fun but trick! but thts the fun part! her this app! I don't get why haterz hate on gr8 games like this one! they cant make a good game thts hard!! so don't hate get the app and enjoy!!!
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|While you won't learn how to actually do anything, this nicely written essay might enlighten you on some popular buzz words related to Web 2.0.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The levels are not difficult music makes it very sublime. Soothes as to not get angry at the game. Good to pass a nice and calm time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game it is spiffy. definatly worth killing time with. my kids enjoy playing it as well. :0)
B007R41E8O|5.0|so worth every cent. great game great story and wonderful visuals.  nice pace mini games are tricky but do able. the game flows nice from one screen to another.
B0033TJATW|1.0|I was very excited to finally see this video com out on DVD until I received it. I didn't even open it because it looked like it was a bootlegged copy from an Asian country.  Most of the language on the back was foreign therefore unreadable to the English reading average person. Yes, I read the reviews listed before I bought it. Yes, the language issue was mentioned, but I just wanted to be able to watch this DVD of MJ again and I only have it on VHS. It was also mentioned that it might not even play on your equipment which after seeing the packaging was one more reason that I returned the DVD.<br /><br />You can take your chances on this DVD for I know from watching the VHS it is fun video and tells a good story in the typical MJ style. FULL OF CLASS and AWESOMENESS. Do beware that parts of the story have been cut but unless you have seen the VHS it is unlikely that you would miss them.<br /><br />I will definitely be watching for the American produced copy of this DVD and will most likely buy after reading the reveiws to find out if it is all there in all it's AWESOMENESS.<br /><br />I only gave it one star because i wouldn't have been able to write a reveiw without. I can't really give it any since I didn't open it and watch it. If it would have been an American copy of the original VHS I would have given it all 5 stars.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|OK.. I'm a guy... but I enjoy a good chick flick, so when I saw the previews for the movie coming out I decided that I would read the book first.  I really enjoyed it.  The relationships develope in realistic ways... without having to have a rediculous missunderstanding... etc... etc..  When things go wrong in the story, they reacted in believable ways.<br /><br />If you're looking for blood and guts... this isn't your book.<br /><br />Now... for the movie!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|While this might not have a lot of pizazz, what it does have is great protection for your phone. It fits well and with the swirls within the soft plastic, it even looks great.  You won't go wrong with this purchase!
B00005JM02|5.0|I am very happy with my Finding Nemo (Two Disc Collector's Edition).  Unfortunately I haven't been able to watch the 2nd disc but I'm sure it will be as good as the 1st disc.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I have just finished reading the trilogy in 3 days. I could not put these books down, I didnt realise it was about bdsm etc and was a little taken aback at first but the story was so good I just couldnt wait to read all three books. I usually read a variety of thrillers and Irish romantics but this trilogy is definitely one I would highly recommend to those with an open mind.<br />Thoroughly griping and exciting.

0307887960|4.0|The Dukan Diet book was quickly delivered.  It is a very interesting and informative book.  No need to order a recipe book because there are many recipes included.  I'm glad I purchased the book because it had a lot more information, details about the diet than I found on line.
B002IFT1ZA|2.0|My wife and I recently finished the first season of Game of Thrones on DVD. We both enjoyed it as a sort of bloody, sex-filled, As the World Turns-type show. Beyond the hacking, slashing, and whoring what we both noticed was that there were a lot of holes in the show which diminished our enjoyment. Some examples SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />- In one of the first episodes a boy is hurt while his father is out traveling with the king. Almost immediately after he is hurt, the father appears at the boy's side. We have no way of knowing how his father received word of the injury; he's just suddenly there which feels like a cinematic mistake.<br /><br />- When the main character arrives in his new post as \\"King's Hand\\" he is asked to make a decision on whether or not a tournament will be held. After quick analysis, he determines it is a waste of money and it should not happen. But then in the following episode or two the tournament is apparently happening. There's no explanation for the sudden change from \\"its not going to happen,\\" to the tournament actually happening.<br /><br />- The the main character is executed he has hold of essential information about the death of the king and the rise to the thrown of a child who is not actually the heir. I find it odd that upon finding out that he is going to be beheaded, the main characters does not divulge any of this information to the people in attendance and seemingly lets this HUGE secret die with him. Ultimately this makes the main character look like an idiot.<br /><br />There are numerous more holes, unexplained items and so on, that ultimately made Game of Thrones Season 1 less like a fantasy epic and more like a poorly written fantasy daytime soap opera (which can be fun in its own right, but surely not to be taken seriously in the way, of say, Lord of the Rings).
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I use to play in elementary school. It brings back a lot of memories. Keep it coming.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones stands alone on the pinnacle of made-for-cable series-making.  Beautiful production values, cinematic scope, detailed creation of a fantastical world, and gorgeous acting (and actors) all make this a must-see as well as simply a joy to experience--even in the violent bits, which are (mostly) not gratuitous.  I cannot praise this series enough.  If you have read these books by George R. R. Martin, then you are already a fan, and if not, you are just missing out.  The only flaw is that there are not enough behind the scenes or commentaries with the Special Features.  The commentaries there are (every other episode basically) are disappointing and lame for the most part.  The best commentary is the one with the Stark children actors, and WARNING:  Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) says the F-word every other sentence during her comments.  She is beautiful, but her language and the quality of her commentary are not.  I'm a complete GoT fan and wanted insights, which to my mind, repeated \\"[insert actor's name here] is F-ing awesome\\" isn't.  But don't let that put you off if you're considering buying this.  The series itself stands alone in its excellence.

1463514581|5.0|I'm NOT a fan of Chick Lit at all, but I needed something light to read after a few heavy duty thrillers so I picked this up. I was so shocked that I couldn't put it down! Rose is just such a lovable character! I found myself laughing out loud more then a few times. As an avid mystery reader I figured I would be able to figure out everything early on, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there are a few things I knew right away, but the ending really caught me for a loop! Very impressive!! I would certainly recommend checking this out!! This certainly gives me hope that maybe all chick lit isn't as bad as it seems.  BRAVO!
1451648537|5.0|Another well-researched, well-written book by Walter Isaacson.  Despite being a tome of over 600-pages, I found I couldn't put the book down and finished it in a week.  It gives the reader a captivating insight into the origins of Silicon Valley against the eclectic backdrop of its time, i.e. the LSD/hippie era, the early geek/hackers, and the search for enlightenment with yogis/meditation.  Furthermore, all the big egos, e.g. Michael Eisner, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates and the rest of the Tech Revolutionaries, made the book very engrossing.  Steve Wozniak's perennial kindness and generosity gives a stark contrast to Steve Jobs' volatility.<br /><br />I hadn't realized how erratic, and even cruel, Steve Jobs was.  One wonders how much more difficult he would have been if he hadn't been so involved with Zen Buddhism.  (It seems many giants who gave the world so much beauty also caused alot of pain to those around them - think Michelangelo, Beethoven, Mozart, Einstein.)  However, the Zen simplicity of line and function did show through in his products and concepts - everything from the Macintosh computer to the iMacs/iPod/iPhones to the Apple Stores.  Steve Jobs and his products truly were an embodiment of the \\"intersection between the humanities and technology\\".<br /><br />It was also refreshing to read about a CEO whose prime objective was to create a phenomenal product, not increase profit margin...Built it and they came...One can only hope that the company he re-built thrives while maintaining his credo of product quality over profit.<br /><br />He was a gifted visionary.  Many of us have reaped the benefits of his creativity and drive in our daily lives.  Despite his foibles, he will be missed.
0385737955|2.0|James Dashner's THE MAZE RUNNER is one of the most frustrating novels I've ever slogged through.  It's not that the story isn't intriguing - it most certainly is!  The sixteen-year-old main character, known only as Thomas, finds himself in a pitch dark elevator (which is called a \\"lift\\" in the novel, as if it's taking place in England) without any memory of his previous life or how he got there.  When he's pulled out of the lift, he's in a strange place called the Glade, which is surrounded by massive stone walls and a mysterious maze inhabited by scary murderous mechanical creatures.  The hundred or so other boys trapped in the Glade have been trying for years to unravel the mystery of the maze so they can escape their prison, but so far no luck.<br /><br />Dashner's style here is pretty much a copy of the TV series LOST, which even fans have to admit was a pretty frustrating experience.  Everything in THE MAZE RUNNER is a mystery, and every time Thomas asks a logical question he's told to \\"shut up\\" or \\"you'll find out later\\" (or someone will be seconds from answering one of his questions when something interrupts him and you'll want to throw the book across the room!).  This may be a good way to stretch out the story, but it's an equally good way to alienate the reader.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, Dashner throws in a mysterious (of course!) girl, who shows up in the lift, the first girl to ever come to the Glade.  But . . . she's in a coma, so she can't explain why she's there . . . or what the mysterious message she delivers means.  I kept expecting the girl to play an integral role in the final act of the story, but she never does.  Even when she wakes up, she has little to say that's of any real value.  It was as if Dashner is following a formula here for YA fiction - a love interest is essential, so throw in a girl for Thomas.<br /><br />This brings me to the most frustrating part of all - as the first in yet another YA trilogy, THE MAZE RUNNER has no real ending.  Yes, a bunch of stuff is finally revealed (in a very annoying fashion - a character comes out of nowhere and just explains a few things), but none of it makes much sense.  And then Dashner drops in a two-page epilogue to set up the next book.  So the reader is left staring at the words \\"END OF BOOK ONE\\" with her mouth hanging open.  End of book one????  Books in a trilogy have to work on their own, even if they encourage readers to buy the next installment.  This one doesn't do that at all.  It just presents a ton of mysteries but offers little that makes sense in way of explaining them.  And I had more questions by the end of the book than I did as I was reading it . . . and not in a good way.  There were just so many loose ends, things that didn't jive, and red herrings dropped in for no apparent purpose.<br /><br />I like dystopian thrillers, and Dashner has envisioned a story that had the potential to be as exciting and satisfying as ENDER'S GAME (with which it has a lot in common).  But THE MAZE RUNNER doesn't live up to that potential.  The characters are thinly drawn, the plot is overrun with both deus ex machina moments and predictable developments, and there is nothing satisfying about the \\"ending.\\" Read this one at your own risk.real ending.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first read this book a few weeks ago. I knew that a film based on the books was coming out and usually when a film is made based on a book, the book is fairly good (whether the movie lives up to the book or not is questionable). I wasn't really sure what to expect when I began reading but I was very happy with what I read. The book was very good!! There are several character in the book but only a few of them are central to the plot so I isn't difficult to keep us with who is who. Katniss is a character that everyone can look up to. She is a strong female character who doesn't sacrafice who she is because she is put in a challenging position. I ended up reading the entire series in two weeks, which when you have two small children and work, it saying something. This was a fantastic book!!

B00756GKBA|5.0|I do not much care if Madonna is supposed to be \\"too old\\" to make this kind of music anymore.......it's POP/electro beats make me get up and dance & then when I listen to the lyrics it's even more interesting. Girl Gone Wild is more infectious than the flu & Gang Bang is an over the top hoot & so totally NOT PC. But that beat cannot be ignored. My favorite right now is Love Spent but Falling Free is lovely & Masterpiece is moving & sad (I did not realize it is from her movie WE). Many of the younger singers today.........ehhh they wail and run up and down the scales like that makes them better singers but they all sound alike. When  a Madonna song comes on - you know it is Madonna.(Same can be said for Britney Spears.....love her or hate her, the songs she picks are well suited to her baby-coo voice style.)When I buy a CD if I want to play it over and over again.........it's a winner. And Madge hits it outta the park with MDNA.

0439023513|5.0|There are enough in depth reviews of this final installment of the series, and although I can understand the perspective of those who didn't like the way it played out I found it absolutely riveting. The characterizations were solid and believable and the horrors and uncertainty of war were well illustrated. Designated a mere tool by those in power Katniss proved that she could live up to Peeta's initial ideal to remain himself from the first novel. I'm still waiting for my son to hit at least 12 before I let him read this series, though.

Thanks Fallen Tree!
B000OZ28IS|4.0|William Boyd really knows how to tell a good story.  This one is a tale of pre-WWII spycraft and one particularly resourceful and resolute woman working for a branch of the British secret service.  When the action jumps forward to the 1970s, the woman's daughter becomes a second and related focus of her mother's story.<br /><br />\\"Restless\\" has been well reviewed, so no need for me to labor on about the plot.  I must say though, that the book was thoroughly entertaining--original, well-paced and rich with interesting characters.  It was the first book that I've read by author Boyd, and it has made me want to try more of his writing.  Definitely recommended.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The look and feel of this game are top-notch.  The actual gameplay, which is a matter of personal preference, doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />If you like puzzle games this is certainly a good one.  I just prefer more freedom and creativity in the games I play.

0545265355|5.0|This is an emotional roller coaster ride all the way through. I strongly recommend reading these before you see the movie, it's really deeply reflecting the current situation in our country with us the 99% and the 1%! It's like what would happen if we let it go on like this in the future, unchecked. I think it was so powerful because it's believable. Ours is a greedy bloodthirsty race of people, and some people would like this kind of world. Most of us would relate to the struggle all of the people of Panem are going through. Hat's off to Suzanne Collins. Wonderful story. I could not put it down!
0439023521|4.0|Young adult fiction lately has been flooded by books about Vampires, Witches, Werewolves, and all sorts of paranormal subjects. They have also invaded movies that are for young adults. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is here to challenge that clich&eacute;d trend.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is in the genre of Science Fiction and Post-Apoocalyptic Fantasy. (So think Mad Max meets Death Race 2000 meets 1984.) That being said, it's not for children below the age of 13.<br /><br />The setting is a future North America where the nation that was once the United States are divided into 12 Districts ruled by an authoritative regime, al a \\"1984\\". And every year, as punishment for the past Civil War between the government and rebels, each District sends two kids, 12 and up, to fight to the death in the arena.<br /><br />When Katniss Everdeen's sister is chosen to go to the arena, she volunteers to take her younger siblings place.<br /><br />That is all I'm going to spoil. :)<br /><br />The plot moves at a very brisk place in the beginning, lags a little in the middle, then moves quickly at the end. The book has many twists you'll never see until they happen. If you love twists in books, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is perfect.<br /><br />When reading the book, I was reminded a lot of Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\". Having to survive in the arena wore down the participants, many went insane after having to fight tooth and nail, and kill. And the people watching the games, like the tribe of children of \\"Flies\\" , cheering as people were killed. And like Ralph in \\"Flies\\", Katniss  fights to remain civilized.<br /><br />Now, before I go on a long literary discussion, let's look at the writing. Collins wrote the book in 1st Person POV, so the only viewpoint in the story you get is Katniss's. I think 1st Person kind of limited the story. I wanted to get into the other character's heads, and learn more about what makes them tick.<br /><br />As for the use of language, Colllins shines. Imaginary drool dripped down my chin at the way she described food. The technology was described simply, like reading \\"Farenheit 451\\" and \\"Dune\\". The action scenes were fast and hard-hitting, just as action should be.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book. I give \\"The Hunger Games\\" 4 out of 5 stars!own my chin at the way she described food. The technology was described simply, like reading \\"Farenheit 451\\" and \\"Dune\\".

B0058YPG1G|5.0|I didnt get into Breaking Bad until last Thanksgiving when my cousin asked if i had watched this show and said it was a good one. He was not lying. I got all 3 seasons and watched S.4 online in a matter of Months. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are extraordinary in playing out the drama that the cat-and-mouse life or death chase they play w/ Gus. Breaking Bad and the older ABC series Lost are the 2 most unpredictable shows i have ever seen. This is a must watch for anybody and their momma!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was entranced and played about twelve levels before I even knew what had happened! A genuinely relaxing game that doesn't make you feel like you need a rest after playing it. Perfect for the end of a day.
B007G5K066|5.0|Let me preface this review with the caveat that I have not read John le Carre's novel but I have seen and rather enjoyed the classic BBC television adaptation of \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.<br /><br />It should go without saying that this post-millennial theatrical adaptation is a different animal. Directed by Tomas Alfredson, whose previous feature \\"Let the Right One In\\" was rightly heralded as an instant classic, has produced with the considerable aid of his screenwriters Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan an extremely stylish, precise, and condensed version of the story. The plot, layered not only in events and characterizations but also in themes, is complicated but not impenetrable; new information is constantly revealed to the audience as the film unfolds, which makes complaints that this film is \\"boring\\" all the more baffling to this reviewer. Attentive viewers should have no trouble following the film.<br /><br />Cold War paranoia infests every frame. Every detail of the film feels calibrated, from the angles of shots to the drab colors of the sets to the postures of the actors, each of whom is superb in their roles: Gary Oldman portrays a quieter, more detached Smiley than Guinness, Mark Strong personifies the sadness of Jim Prideaux, and Tom Hardy makes a surprisingly vulnerable Ricky Tarr.<br /><br />If I were to boil down the key difference between this film and the earlier BBC version (other than, of course, the length of time in which to tell the story), I would have to say atmosphere. Both are extremely well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted, but it was only in this film version where I could palpably feel the tension of the scenario.<br /><br />This Blu-ray features a fine, film-like transfer. Extra features are not overly abundant, consisting of an audio commentary from Alfredson and Oldman, a couple of deleted scenes, and filmmaker interviews. The most interesting extra for me personally was the interview with le Carre himself where the author discusses his background and delves much deeper than the usual fluff piece.<br /><br />The story of \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" is an espionage classic, and this latest film adaptation is a fine example of the genre and worthy of standing alongside the BBC version and other classics in the fold. Highly recommended.

B005CWRB44|5.0|An amazingly bright flashlight that fits in my pocket.  I've been using this for two months pretty regularly and the battery shows no signs of growing weak.  I bought 10 extra batteries and have no idea when I'll use them.  I consider this one of my more profitable purchases.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game but the app is buggy... added 24+ hours to my crop times and my business collections freezes more than it should! iron out the wrinkles and it'll be 5 stars!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|game is cool. its a good way to pass the time. very enjoyable. Highly recommended for little kids. It runs great on my kindle.i give this game 5 stars
0545305497|5.0|I am lucky to have found such a great buy on Amazon!!  No wait I take that back lol Amazon always comes through.  I received my Hunger games trilogy quickly, in new condition and sealed in plastic.  The family fought over who read it first.  Thank you to a great seller, I would buy more books from you again
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have this for the ds and dsi but this is the coolest game ever! this would be cool for the x-box 360 to.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love this game addictive and fun. seconds to learn, super easy yo pick up and learn but has plenty of depth
B0055SWM08|5.0|started playing about 20 minutes ago.  haven't set it down yet!  very peaceful way to unwind before bed...  as well as stretching the grey matter :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really good! Simple mechanics, yet unique gameplay and puzzles. Be sure to check it out! I'm sure you will like it.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Appears to be yet another variation of the classic tile puzzle game (the &quot;15&quot; puzzle).  Aces Traffic (?) and Fling!, also free apps,  work on the same general principle.  So, if you  enjoy this kind of puzzle, it's definitely worth trying.  As others have mentioned, the music is pleasant and I prefer the &quot;look&quot; to that of,  say, Fling!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have only had this up for a couple of minutes for this is becoming extremely addicting. 18 19 20
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The level of detail and imagery really transports you to a different world. I just started book five, and I am more happy with this series than I have been of any series before.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun, difficult, time consuming, the best recipe for a good game. add that the graphics are smooth, the background is nice and the music is decent, its just icing on the cake.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. just wish the energy would last a little bit longer so that I could play longer with out waiting for the next steps
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this new book is awesome. it is so easy to get lost in the world of greek mythology with this book. i love it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this mario-based game is absolutely hilarious and super cute! the graphics are clear and the controls are easy on my kindlefire.
B002OUV7SS|5.0|A few years back my wife and I spent a couple of evenings in St Marks. The music was a delightful send off for Venice. This recording brings back the ambiance of those evenings. These intimate renditions of some of the most beautiful music in the western world are a welcome back to a most pleasent time. I'm not sure Wagner wouldn't have appreciated the care and artistry that went into these arrangments. In a concert hall maybe these selections wouldn't be all that gratifying, but in the open plaza of St. Marks they would be a delight along with a glass of champagne, coffee, or whatever.
B006ISJQ26|4.0|Being able to relate as the star role of Farrel is all to eazy for me but the end result was a buzz kill. Looking for far more than expected will only let you down. Living life as a true Gangster takes passion. Where the bloody h*## can I find the soundtrack to this flic?
B0055SWM08|5.0|the game is both challenging yet relaxing at the same time! Try it and you will see what I mean.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I do not own this actual product, as I never could have waited 10 years to own the entire Smallville! I of course have purchased them one per year since 2001. But I wanted to review the series as a whole. And this does look like a really nice set. I saw it in the store, and the books and pictures looked really great. I wanted it! Of course, complete series are kind of pointless unless you become a fan in the last season, or are behind on your wish list. On the bright side, I have the Special Edition of Season 8: the limited edition \\"steel\\" case from Best Buy!<br /><br />Anyway, SMALLVILLE is pretty much my most favorite TV show ever. (It kind of ties with The Golden Girls, I Love Lucy, and All in the Family, but those are comedies, so you can't really compare.) Never have I spent 10 years - a third of my life - devoted to making sure I saw my show every week! Wow, I can't believe it was that long. Smallville drew me in from Season 1 and never let go. I'd watch it another 10 years, now that he's finally Superman, and has all those new adventures at his doorstep! The finale, incidentally, had to be just about the greatest series finale in all of TV history.<br /><br />I started watching Smallville because I was such a huge fan of [[ASIN:B000HWZ4BG Lois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete Seasons 1-4]], which had ended 3 or so years earlier. It is so hard to choose whether Dean Cain or Tom Welling makes a better Clark Kent. They are both just amazing. But SMALLVILLE is definitely my favorite show!!<br /><br />Now, I might make some people mad, but to those of you who are complaining that you already own the individual seasons and will not shell out money for a complete set unless they release it on blu-ray: stop being so spoiled. Yes, blu-ray is a very nice picture. But Smallville on DVD is hardly horrible quality, despite being filmed a \\"whole decade ago.\\" It's filmed beautifully, with amazing acting and more special effects than most TV shows, and even a lot of movies. Even the ONE season that is currently as old as a decade is very high quality.even a lot of movies. Even the ONE season that is currently as old as a decade is very high quality.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like all the options and variation of the games. the cards are easy to see and play. nice tap feature to move cards. but don't care for the dragging of the cards.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun, although some games are hard to control its an easy game for all ages that makes  time fly!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game they ever have created forkindle fire itsawesome<br /><br />best game ever created for kindle fire if u don't get it ( u sucked.  )
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a nice game that challenges you and makes you think. very relaxing music and fx.  I recommend this game if you have some time to kill.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell is by far one of the best games I have ever played, but the developers are practically begging for reviews, if they removed this, it would be much more enjoyable.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Loads of fun!  Keeps the mind going.  Think outside the box!  :)<br />  I highly recommend this game!<br />you should try this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome! i read other people's things they sayed and i think the same thing too!  love the game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Probably I spend on it too much time. Graphics are very pleasing and I like watchingnthe hustle and bustle ofnmy city.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the game...just hate running out of energy so quick because I would like to be able to play longer.
0345803485|5.0|I head about 50 shades of grey and I was very interested in reading it, then I hear from a friend that it was originally trasformed from Twilight fan fiction and that it was \\"dirty\\" as she put it, then I knew I had to read it!! I finished the 3 books in 5 days and when I was finished I started all over. The 3rd book is my favoite book because Cristian Grey becomes everything that I want him to be and what Anistasia needs him to be. I continually want to go back and read a chapter here and there and I just can't get the story out of my head. I am so thankfull for EL James to take the time to write these 3 book's and I am so excited to see what her new novel is going to be about. I am hoping that she keeps with the theme of these books because she does it so well, I guess I will have to wait and find out like everyone else. I am a fan for life of her and these amazing book's. Please go and read all of them now without stopping. :)
0756405890|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Not sure if it would have been told better as going through the story real time versus a guy retelling his life story, but that's not that big of a deal.  It occasionally allows him to jump forward a bit or skim through time without it being awkward.  Some reviewers have complained about slow sections, but the book went fast for me.  It's not as action packed as Lord of the Rings, and the magic is more subdued and more mentally taxing, so it may be a bit tame compared to other fantasy books, but the characters are well developed and the story is good.  Would have liked a bit more of a climax, but even without that I look forward to the next book.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game had great possibilities and fell short. Takes forever to earn energy, requires real money to do anything cool or progressive. If I wanted to play this type of game I'd be sitting in front of my PC playing on facebook. Booooo.
B003UYUP58|4.0|If you want to know about the history of the humankind fight against cancer, that's the book. Laymen language! Do not miss it.
B0073U2F12|1.0|Dumb stupid trash. Another \\"end of world wannabe \\"  This DVD should not have been sold for more than Five dollars at a dollar store.  It has 3rd rate actors and the plot is so childish.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The concept is simple; the game, however, is not. Thought-provoking, interesting, and addictive. I would have paid for this and not batted an eyelash.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome game. Just like super Mario brothers. It is about time someone makes a game like that<br />. I love it.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Works well. Better than most if not all of the others. The map feature is great.  Took me a day or to to realize i needed to turn off the &quot;alerts,&quot; they drove me crazy for a while.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I thought it is sooo much fun. it is a lot like Mario bros but free and filled with fun.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I live in Tasmania and was in Melbourne when \\"Love Never Dies\\" was on, but unfortunately I could not afford the exorbitant prices they were asking for it, so I missed out. So I waited for the Blu-Ray to come out and having watched it was blown away. I saw the original Phantom in Australia, UK & Canada and thought it could not be bettered. I do not like sequels, as they tend to be extremely disappointing. Not so with LND.<br />It was worth the wait and I have the added bonus of having the best seat in the house.<br />I am not going to go into the meat of the show, as you will have to see it for yourselves.<br />But I can certainly recommend it to all. The cast are superb, as are the sets, costumes and lighting. When I see shows like this, it makes me proud to be an Aussie.<br />This is a work I will watch over and over again as there is not a dull section anywhere, the twist and turns make sure of that. Plus the Regent Theatre is the best venue to facilitate a show of this magnitude.<br />If you have Blu-ray, go for it as the image and sound (DTS) are beyond first rate.<br />I have been a fan of ALW since his first work and I am proud to say that I have everything he has ever written in my vast collection.<br />So purchase with confidence and enjoy ALW at his creative best.

B001EC2ISA|4.0|Fun movie, enjoy watching Michael Keaton, watched this movie for many years and wanted a copy for my home library.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it a really fun game its pretty much like super Mario bros on the wii except u know its not on the wii.so ya, anyway it is a super fun game hope u like it 2!!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a captivating, wonderful game.  It's a simple concept with beautiful music and a great interface.  Definitely worth a purchase.
0545265355|1.0|I ordered the hunger games trilogy box set. It still hasn't been shipped. I ordered it on March 29th. I am extremely dissatisfied that its taken this long and there still isn't any in stock. I just think its ridiculous that its taken this long and its still not in stock. it really makes me not want to order anything from amazon ever again. I mean why cant they get more in stock. hunger games is extremely popular right now, you would think they would have books in stock or that it wouldnt take this long to get more in stock. i am so unbelievably annoyed!

And I loved reading it on my laptop.So i ordered a Kindle Fire so i could take it with to read and I am hooked on reading books this way now.And this book We need to talk about Keven  is great !
B0058EBNAO|4.0|It does what it should, but it is a little awkward in it's presentation.  It gives me quick and accurate weather warnings.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very addictive game. Also really relaxing with the background music. No issues with play. Love playing it!
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Its a intresting app but hard and annoying to control. When i got it i expected a lot more based on the good reviews but although its fun, its a major pain to control.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love love love this game....the energy thing is kinda a bum but its what makes the game challenging and they have to have a way to try and make money from this being its a free game! so worth it. i am addicted lol
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Orson Welles at his very best in a searing drama beautifully photographed and acted. The angles of the b&w photography add a menacing edge to the feel of the movie, and enhance and heighten the viewers' fear of Orson Welles' character.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|This book is great for people who know nothing of, little of, or a lot about Evolution.<br />people who read this book and still doubt evolution shouldn't rightly be called \\"people\\" but rather some lower lifeform incapable of objective, rational thought.
B005F6NA56|5.0|That a mainstream pop singer-songwriter can be this talented ought to be some sort of crime. Feist manages childlike sincerity, wonder, and vulnerability concurrently with maturity, fiendish songwriting genius, and summative command of all that she presents herself to be. I think I hate her.<br /><br />Part of what sets this artist apart from many others is her acute sensitivity to texture. Her guitar playing, objectively evaluated, cannot be said to be virtuosic, and yet she's able to transform her mere technical competence into textural genius; every note, every acoustic string buzz-out seems deliberate, and the results usually lead to a composition that may be simple in theory, but the cascade of sounds seem to belie the theory. There's too much going on to dismiss this lady as a pop singer bent on catchy melodies, as much of the music on here is definitely not meant for radio play.<br /><br />Considering all of this, the greatest triumph on this record for this reviewer's money is definitely \\"Caught a Long Wind.\\" The song begins with interwoven sounds and takes a few subtly different twists and turns from there, at one point held together with nothing but a clap. An organic Kate Bush influence is undeniable, but the piece is squarely Feist's own. Her ability to take a twee subject and make it into an intriguing listen is evidenced by lyrics like the cute-clever \\"Good morning bird/good nightingale\\" and the deeper \\"The current tells of what the wave withheld.\\"<br /><br />As a die-hard progressive rock fan, I suppose it's asking too much in 2012 for a mainstream songwriter to undertake a concept album project. Fair enough, but she could do it with wondrous results. At least it's time for some official live material. Either one would be welcomed.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I just bought this K-bar and it is alot larger than I thought. I love it. When you put this knife in your hand you know that you have something that will last. I'm in the military and do alot of outdoor survial stuff. So I use and abuse my stuff and it holds up by far. The only thing I wish that would have came with it would have been some molle attachment stuff, although I like to modify everything for me so I will. Great knife.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging, relaxing, &amp; fun: Challaxun!<br />  Or<br />Fulaxenging! Yeah, it's definitely fulaxenging.  And, as App Of The Day, is a bargain at twice the price! :-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun app. controls aren't the greatest but it's a good way to pass time. I would recommend to download this.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a very good game.  It has some kinks in it, though.  It needs to judge time better (I always end up just getting rewarded for one day of play).  I don't think energy is an issue, as it is supposed to make you check other games after you are dried out.  However, it would be better if the amount of time for buildings/resources to trigger for collection should be longer to compensate for the energy.
B00378VGGO|5.0|An excellent movie. The animation is amazing and imbues the \\"characters\\" with strong personalities. The quality of the voice acting adds to this, thus making the characters live and breath in a manner that exceeds many \\"live action\\" movies. The story is strong, the dialogue witty and touching,and this is an all around good film.
B0063IH60K|4.0|really enjoy playing this game. I do wish it had a pause button but other than that I haven't found any faults
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was not at all what I expected it to be, yet I enjoyed it immensely. I thought it would be a lot creepier and more gothic. It was actually more of a fantasy - and we all know that I usually struggle with fantasy books. This one was different though. I think it was because there was a clear set of rules that the fantastical elements operated in. Each peculiar child had a special talent, there was no random magic happening at convenient times for the sake of advancing the plot.<br /><br />The ending of this book definitely paves the way for a sequel and while I would like to read more, I was quite satisfied with how this book wrapped up. If for some reason there isn't a sequel, I won't be lying awake at night over it.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the book are real vintage photographs. The author incorporates these photos into the story - most of them are of the peculiar children. It was as if someone handed the author a stack of eclectic photos and said, \\"I challenge you to weave these into a story.\\" I thought it was a unique device. Because of these photos, I would recommend if you read the electronic version that you do so on a color reader. The photos looked like muddy blurs on my Kindle but looked great on my iPad.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like the game but wish the energy refilled faster and it glitches quite often and freezes. other than that I enjoy the game!!
B005QUQP76|4.0|I struggle to find mice that can pull double duty but the Vengeance M60 comes pretty close. Being disabled (spinal cord injury) with very limited use of my hands and fingers I've had to become very creative in order to play just about any game. So I won't be quoting any fancy numbers just usability in this review. Okay back to the games, yes there are some that are simply point and click but they get boring in a hurry. That's where a good quality mouse comes in. The more it can be customized the better. This mouse isn't without issues and I would never expect to find one that didn't. I just need something I can live with. The M60 comes close and at a price that fits my budget compared to others.<br /><br />On the plus side it can take a beating (I've dropped it several times unintentionally)and seems to be holding up well. I have it set up pretty close to meet my needs even with what many consider to be buggy software but I haven't noticed anything major with it. In fact it's pretty easy to set up without needing a manual an inch thick. The material it's made out of helps make it easier to grip a major plus for me.<br /><br />On the minus side I'm not crazy about the corded covering all the manufacturers are using these days. For me if not kept straight or close to it they tend to get kinks in them making them harder to use. I know I could go to a wireless mouse but even the best ones tend to lag and dealing with batteries for me is a pain. About the only real issue is its size. I have fairly large hands and though they don't work as an able-bodied persons do I find that it's a little on the small side. Other than that it is working for me and with time I'll adjust to its quirks.
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice game.  good concept.  Good music.  very short learning curve.  play as short or long as you want.  nails casual gaming.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great graphics, smooth action, no problems at all on my Dell Streak 7.  Simple enough for children, but entertaining for adults as well.  Highly recommended!
0439023513|1.0|I read all three books together .Wasnt even aware of the Hunger games trilogy until the movie came out .Liked the first book a lot obviously and then the second one even though slow in the beginning was still pretty good .<br />The third one is just terrible ,Its one of the worst books ive ever read !! .Firstly it drags throughout most of the book with no meaning or purpose .Secondly the plot is absolutely ridiculous .<br />I suppose Collins tried to make the whole thing realistic for a 17 year old girl and not say some kind of fictional story about a super -hero like say Harry Potter but its supposed to be fiction!<br />In the first book Katniss  volunteers herself to save her sisters life ,not only does she fail -it renders the first two books moot and makes a mockery of the whole series .<br />Katniss is basically painted as an angry ,confused ,drugged young girl throughout the book ,her mission was plain futile and in the end turned out to be just a suicide mission for both Katniss and all her dear ones ,why her sister would be killed makes no sense ,Peeta in the end served no purpose by coming along .<br />I think Collins just ran out of ideas(since she had no more hunger games) and just tried to finish the book .She should have taken her time instead of throwing up absolute garbage like this .<br />Really a pity ,Collins basically ruined the whole franchise with the last book .

B000TDXPSC|5.0|they just fit so well! people say the beats look better, but for less than half the price of the aluminum beat-pros, these deliver great sound (as loud as you need it), and all the parts are replaceable and affordable.

0061726834|4.0|Book rave for the week: Delirium by Lauren Oliver was a.m.a.z.i.n.g. though slow to start, the foundation for this world is so extensively planted and the main character neither too frail nor too strong. What would the world be like if LOVE were the enemy?<br />It didn't end the way I anticipated at all, but the last lines were haunting and wonderful and beautiful. <3

0345803485|4.0|I have never read anything from the BDSM genre before so I do not have any comparative reference within this genre, but I have to say that I found the story to be very captivating. The main characters, Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, are well sculpted. Honest. Real. Raw. The psychological pain, confusion and struggles they endure as they both explore their emotional and physical boundaries forces the reader to question the very meaning of absolute trust.<br /><br />While Fifty Shades of Grey is - at its core - a romance, one that is set in the world of BDSM, this is definitely more about self discovery. I definitely wouldn't say this fictional story is a true representation of a group of people as a whole - no one story is - but do I believe it to reveal how functional relationships do not always fall into the \\"hearts and flowers\\" stereotype. The truth of the matter is, relationships are organic and the ways in which people explore their sexuality, sensuality and individuality will continue to evolve. The act of BDSM or having a fascination with and/or desire to dabble in its world may just be an exploration of ones own vulnerability, ability to trust and their emotional/physical limits.<br /><br />A very intriguing and off-kilter way of exploring these ideas.
0385737955|4.0|the action is great and the mystery keeps reeling you along. i liked the world-building and the main character. i felt some of the dialogue and slang got annoying, though - as did a few of the supporting characters. but the book is imaginative and well-paced and well worth checking out!

1587613379|5.0|I had recently found myself in the middle of a polyamorous arrangement (two, actually) and desperately trying to work out how to keep all involved feeling cared for and respected when a friend suggested I read this book.<br /><br />I must say, I was very impressed at the care and forethought evidently put in the text, and I felt as though the authors were very careful to make no assumptions about their audience, thereby widening their applicable audience immensely.<br /><br />My favorite parts were those on jealousy and conflict. \\"Unlearning jealousy\\" as the authors call it, is a fantastically valuable goal and process, one that I will continue to aspire to regardless of the \\"poly\\" or \\"mono\\" nature of my future relationships.<br /><br />In short, there is no one that I would not recommend this book to.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just finished reading this on the kindle.  I had read a few of his books in the past and because I do so much reading, never got around to reading this.  I'm so glad I finally did.  What an amazing story by a brilliant author! Highly recommended!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love this game! I can hardly put it down! Very easy to use. it really brings back memories of playing this game back in grade school.
B0076NAWWA|4.0|Well, when I read some Mike Portnoy interviews late last year describing this line up and effort, I thought \\"hmmmm...being a semi-fan of Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, and even Steve Morse, this should be interesting.\\"<br /><br />And it is.  It's catchy.  Seriously, within one or two listens I had some melodies sticking in my head, and I was unconsciously humming to a couple of tunes.  Then after a fourth or fifth listen I was starting to understand that \\"instantly catchy\\" doesn't necessarily mean \\"enduring\\".  Yes, there's a \\"Coldplay\\" vibe in a few of the pop-rock tunes, and I don't fault these guys for trying something different, that's for sure.  And there are some Coldplay songs I actually like, so that's not necessarily a show-stopper either.  I guess as much as I tried to manage my expectations on this, I couldn't shake the feeling of slight disappointment with it as well.  Given the pool of talent on this, you almost can't avoid having high expectations, and even knowing the band was aiming for more of a pop-rock record, I guess I was hoping/expecting something that would push the boundaries of pop-rock more than sounding like Coldplay or something off a \\"Dawson Creek\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- The vocalist.  Nice voice and solid delivery of the songs.  I've moaned about Neil Morse' voice in other reviews.  It's not horrible, but it's not a great \\"lead voice\\".  Some folks have oboe-voices (thin and reedy) and others have full-bodied baritone sax voices that are nice instruments all by themselves (not unlike Greg Lake or John Wetton in their prime).  This Casey-guy from the band \\"Alfa-Rev\\" (sp?) has a very solid voice, and MUCH better voice than Neil Morse.  The stark difference was VERY obvious to me the one or two songs were Neil takes a lead line or two while Casey is doing most the singing<br />- There are some very nice hard-rocking, proggy jams in a few of the songs.  Steve Morse blows away a few fine solos, and that, tied with the energy in some of the music makes for an enjoyable listen.  And bass, drums, and keys deliver very nicely as well, and as expected, the playing is very tight<br />- Some well-written, likeable songs<br />- I actually liked the variety of styles even though the strength of the songwriting wasn't always consistent<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- When Neil sings I wish he wouldn't (I even prefer Mike Portnoy's voice)...though I admit it's a negative mostly in direct comparison to the better lead vocalist, Casey-what's-his-name.  And Neil really doesn't sing much on this fortunately (in his defense, I think he's a fine backing and harmonizing vocalist)<br />- That Coldplay/Dawson-Creek soundtrack vibe.  Flying Colors isn't the only supposedly \\"prog\\" outfit that borders on this sound (there are a few newer post/prog bands that are sounding more pop than the prog or post rock they profess to be)<br />- Not enough cool jams and player indulgence.  I know that wasn't the aim of the band for this record, but STILL I found myself missing it<br /><br />So, why did I give is a 4?  Well, I really did like it for the most part.  Nothing on it sucks...some of it is just \\"ho-hum\\" and didn't seem to live up to its potential.  It's really more like a 3.6 or 3.7 with a round-up, but I'm sure I'll be listening to at least a few of these tunes for many years.  And just to qualify, I really don't mind a little pop-rock in my prog (or vice versa) as I liked the first Asia record, and even a more recent example, Yes' \\"Fly from Here\\".

B0055SWM08|5.0|it really doesn't feel like you're being hipped buying this game! Much enjoyment for kids and adults. Graphically smooth and the audio is great!!
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a very interesting game. Say goodbye to old puzzles. This is the new generation of puzzle solving. Also, love the background and name. The game though gets pretty confusing and hard but that is what games are: challenging.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game on the kindle fire. I have only had one minor issue with the game and one of. the updates other than that great game.

B006DDU850|5.0|Root beer tasted better in 1958, less preservatives. State accents, undiluted due to the influence of television, were thicker back then than they are now. I know this because I just took a trip back in time with Stephen King.<br /><br />  Now these are the rules of time travel according to Stephen King:<br />1.When you go back in time, it's always September 9, 1958.<br />2.When you go back in time, it's always the first time. The people you met on your first visit won't recognize you the second, third or fourth time around.<br />3.When you return to the present(2011 in this novel), no matter how long you stayed in the past, whether it be three  hours or four years, it's always only two minutes later. Don't worry about feeding the cat even if you're gone for years. It can do without for two minutes.<br /><br />  Al Templeton, the owner of a Maine diner has spent several years in the past with the intention of preventing Lee Harvey Oswald from killing President Kennedy. When he is diagnosed with lung cancer in 1962, he realizes he won't live long enough to carry out this noble deed. He returns to 2011 and recruits Jake Epping, a compassionate English teacher to take his place. Jake, however, quickly learns that the past is obdurate. It doesn't want to be changed and the more ambitious the change, the more obstacles you will encounter, stomach problems, migraine headaches. Would Al Templeton have got lung cancer if he hadn't gone after Oswald? Possibly, put probably not.<br /><br /> To tell you more would spoil the many surprises that await you in this novel. The audio version is read by the actor Craig Wasson, the star of Ghost Story and Brian de Palma's Body Double. The audio version of this book should win the prize for best audio book for 2011 fiction. Wasson obviously respects the material he is reading. He gives a different voice to each character so that none of the characters sounds the same as any other. In my opinion, this is Stephen King's best work since The Stand.<br /><br />  By the way, the audio version of this book won't play on regular CD players, so don't buy the audio if you plan to listen to the CD in your car, not unless you have a MP3 CD player in your car.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm so happy I found a game like this, I love it! I seriously play it every single day. Any Mario lover will adore this game. And best of all its free ... I definitely recommend this game to anybody :)

1442346949|5.0|I listened to this book on audio cd, although it was long and I finished it in one sitting, it was awesome. I have read and watched a little on steve jobs but the personal connection this book has to steve and all the people in it makes it very interesting.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this app! the ads are shown briefly before game starts and you have the option to skip them if you want.
B00756GKBA|4.0|It's better than Hard Candy, and isn't that really all that counts?<br />Ha, maybe not. To be sure, it makes up for that debacle. This album is fun, a decent follow up to Confessions On A Dance Floor, arguably her last great album, because unlike the last two albums, Madonna was a trendsetter, not trend-follower, and on Hard Candy, she made no attempt to set any trends, and just followed the R&B/hip-hop craze that was going on during that time. Here, she goes a bit retro, but tends to stay with the electro-pop theme of today, which actually isn't all that bad. Overall, I'd say MDNA is a fun album with a few hitches here and there.<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild- DEFINITELY the best track on here. Just a good Madonna dance song. 5/5*<br /><br />Gang Bang- The track that makes the album explicit, it should be bad, but it's oddly addictive, even for it's simple bass drum sound, mixed with a few electro sounds. 4/5*<br /><br />I'm Addicted- A meandering electro song. They DID realize that the synth sound they used gets screechy, very cacophonic, and unpleasant when overused, right? WRONG! Play it at a VERY low volume level. 2/5*<br /><br />Turn Up The Radio- An electro clash song with a promising build up, then terrible let down with a monotonous chorus. Turn DOWN the radio. 3/5*<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin'- The song that's so 60s retro and addictive at that. One of the best. 5/5*<br /><br />Some Girls- An electro song with a intro that leaves more to be desired, but is overall not that bad at all. 4/5*<br /><br />Superstar- A song probably made for all the tweens with it's terribly childish sounding lyrics. 3/5*<br /><br />I Don't Give A- A strange title for a pretty good song, save the utterly pretentious choral ending. 4/5*<br /><br />I'm A Sinner (I Like It)- Another retro song with a title a lyrics destined to infuriate the zealous religious, and it did. Take it from someone who isn't so uptight; it's really pretty good, one of my favorites. 5/5*<br /><br />LoveSpent- I like how, towards the end, Madonna usually gets softer, more ballad-y songs. This one's pretty good. 4/5*<br /><br />Masterpiece- A good song, one of my favorite, with maybe a few silly lyrics, but overall one of the best songs here. 5/5*<br /><br />Falling Free- A simple, light song. Pretty nice. 4/5*<br /><br />***BONUS TRACKS***<br /><br />Beautiful Killer- The 3rd retro sounding track, it's the best bonus track, and one of the best songs here. Very addictive. 5/5*<br /><br />I F'd Up- I can't believe she'd actually build a song around the F-bomb, NOT TO MENTION that it would sound SINCERE! If she hadn't dropped the F-bomb, and attached it to this track, I wouldn't have any reservations about this track, as it's really pretty good. 4/5*<br /><br />B-Day Song- The 4th retro track on here, and it's so silly sounding. 3/5*<br /><br />Best Friend- A jittery sounding song wit a pretty good chorus. 4/5*<br /><br />GMAYL (LMAO Remix)- It's not a bad remix. At least you have the original. 4/5*<br /><br />Overall, save for a few blah tracks, it's really not that bad. I'd recommend it. Certainly there are a few songs that will easily appeal to casual fans.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|It works fine for recording You Tube videos.  I use it on my Motorola Photon and am able to record various video clips.  Not all videos are recordable because of formatting just as a lot of videos won't play on a smart phone or iPad but it will play most and record some.
0385342063|5.0|As a fan of 'Can You Keep a Secret?' this is my new favorite book by Sophie Kinsella. She really knocks it out of the park again. It's a quick, fun, easy read and you will fall in love with Poppy after the first few pages! In a world of texting, and Facebook, etc. the story line isn't so far fetched. I couldn't wait to read this book in paperpack. You will love it as I did!

( the final boss uses most of the attacks that you could hav)
0307477479|3.0|This book was interesting enough to keep me reading it to the end.  However, a few months later, I had difficulty remembering what the book was about.  In contrast, I have vivid,lasting memories of Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose or Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient.
B0073U2FB2|1.0|As far as popular supernatural subgenres of film are concerned, it seems reasonable to expect one or two of every ten to be a decent flick; when it comes to the traditional alien invasion movie, for example, there's usually at least one Attack the Block to match up against the likes of Battle: Los Angeles, Skyline, and Cowboys & Aliens. Unfortunately, The Darkest Hour, which follows a group of tourists in Russia trying to survive an extraterrestrial attack, falls squarely in the company of the latter. Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella play Sean and Ben, two social networking entrepreneurs looking to market their software in Russia when strange lights in the sky descend up on Moscow and begin vaporizing humans. It's probably easy to guess what the problems were with The Darkest Hour: I found the plot devices trite and contrived, the special effects lazy, and the characters wholly unremarkable. Don't bet on getting many out-of-this-world kicks from this one.
B00070DK1E|4.0|Another jewel in Tulls cap. This is another great CD, with Ian's voice not its usual, but still in great form. Reminds me a tad of Mark Knopfler. I love the fact that the band apologized to Metalicca, shows the great sense of humorof Ian and his bandmates. My favorites follow most everyones: Farm on the freeway, Budapest, She said she was a dancer. But honestly, the entire CD is incredible. It flows smoothly from song to song. It is a strong addition to my ever growing Tull/Anderson collection. I would strongly recomment it!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Every once in a while, a movie comes along that will compel me to say, \\"It's worth seeing for the acting alone,\\" and if ever there was a prime example of this phenomenon, it was last year's The Iron Lady. In The Iron Lady, Meryl Streep plays former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with the same chameleonic grace she harnessed for her portrayal of Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia. Told primarily in flashback, Phyllida Lloyd's portrait begins in Thatcher's youth, then traces her rise to power and chronicles her involvement in certain key historical events. To get a sense of my opinion of the film, consider the following: Lloyd's only other feature directorial effort, 2008's ABBA-themed musical Mamma Mia, is actually better The Iron Lady, but for her work on the latter, Streep took home Best Actress honors from the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Academy Awards. In other words, The Iron Lady is worth seeing for the acting alone.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Slow but lets you preview email. Latest version put in obtrusive ads at the bottom of the screen . I wish they had left them out.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Simply the best game ever for Kindle Fire. I just can't put it down. Not a big fan of the music but I just mute it and play a rave from TuneIn instead.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|AWESOME! i really like this app it reminds me of Mario bros.  I played all the time as a kid.
B004SBX112|3.0|do you like any angry birds? if you do, you should get it.<br />but if you don't, you shouldn't get it.
B007R41E8O|5.0|so far I love this game cant wait to finish it. it is so hard to put down! if you like games like mystery case files you will definitely love this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A wonderfully addicting puzzle game that is capable of being played at many levels. You can solve the puzzle by brute force, but you will want to keep playing the same level over and over, refining your play each time, until you solve it with the optimum number of moves. I have not played all the levels yet, but I've played enough to know that this will be a favorite.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The app works great and is really fun.  The only concern I have is the app freezes if I lock my screen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an interesting little game. It's easy to learn, yet still is difficult enough to hold my interest. The music is very nice and the gameplay is very smooth.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great way to pass the time. $0.99 well spent. the achievements keep it interesting. would love some different upgrades and scenery but for the price its perfect.
0891419063|5.0|My father war a WWII vet and I never got to hear the stories sadly. This book is an excellent read for anyone looking to know what  it was like on the front lines of WWII in the Pacific Theater of War. God Bless Sledge and his comrades as they faced the most hellish environment that we will never know.<br /><br />As far as the most popular negative review on the book (albeit still glowing), the riflemen did not live long enough to write about their encounters. I wish they had but we were not afforded that luxury.<br /><br />Great book. A must read for anyone interested in WWII.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|yellow heart would not work has a system glitches even used hints and did not work. trying to reload otherwise went that far without hints only used hints when yellow heart didn't work.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is an epic puzzle game. It's fun and addicting. It also works great on Fire. Quell is one of the best games I've played and was totally worth the download.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This simple game is refreshing and fun, I love it. It's a great game to play in class or any time you may need to pay a little attention to your surroundings.
B0055SWM08|3.0|this game is fun at first but the it just hurts your brain. if your good with that stuff- then get it! but if your not like me- don't get it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it... i play as often as I can... try it I know you will love it too trust me!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|l love solitaire and have it on my iphone but the screen is small so it's hard to play but on my Kindle Fire it's amazing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its so fun and just like mario.. it has clovers instead of mushrooms and so much more you would love it
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to use.  Great graphics. Everything you need from a solitaire game. Even has the option to add additional suits. That for me was entirely unexpected.
B0055SWM08|4.0|The game mechanics are the same as several flash games so nothing new there, but the graphics and music are very well done and relaxing. great game!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Sometimes one star. sometimes five with first two books but ultimately five! Then third book and definitely five plus. In a way it's really about Ana and how strong she is. But when she is submissive I cringe and think one star. But eventually I realized it is just more of her strength. hard to recommend these books to my friends because of the excessive and explicit sex but to me, part of the beauty. Christian's evolution is stunning in the hands of this winderful girl Anastasia. Definitely all three going into my Favorite Favorites Collection along with The Hunger Games, Night Circus, and The Fault of Our Stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great app. very interactive and fun for kids. cant stop playing or put down. i love the continuous fun for all ages.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is amazing, challenging, and beautiful.  A simple premise at first, however the challenge is there for those who want.  The music and graphics are both awesome as well.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|So, my daughter has become obsessed with `Mary Poppins'.  She wants to be her.  She watches this movie daily, sings all the songs, draws pictures of her, runs through the house with her umbrella, asks me CONSTANTLY what `supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' means...etc.<br /><br />Seriously, she is OBSESSED.<br /><br />Normally, her obsessions ware on me, and I'm sure that in time this one will too, but one thing that has come of this is that I've actually got to sit through the film a few times recently.  Now, I saw `Mary Poppins' years ago, and I've always held it in high regard.  I love Julie Andrews; seriously.  She's one of my favorite actresses and I've always held a special place in my heart for both `Mary Poppins' and `The Sound of Music'; her two most recognizable films.  So, with years behind me, I settled in to watch this film for the first time in a long time and I must say that I was astounded at how well this delightful film holds up.  It's still just as charming and magical as the first day I saw it.<br /><br />But my oh my, this is a long movie!<br /><br />Julie Andrews, who snagged an Oscar for her performance in this film, is just all sorts of amazing as the magical nanny who comes along at the right time to spread some joy and bring a family closer together.  The rest of the cast is also delightful, even Dick Van Dyke despite a horribly shaky Cockney accent.<br /><br />From dazzling set pieces to beautifully composed songs to sharply meshed animated sequences, `Mary Poppins' has so much to offer!  This is a great Anniversary Edition (I know that there has been a 45th released, but this is the one I own and I see no real need to upgrade) with loads of special features to keep you and your little ones occupied.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really enjoy this game. only wish it was easier to get more energy. hate waiting plus an easier way to find people who play the game already.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it is great.... I would not change a thing. xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo
B0055SWM08|5.0|app of the day isn't always worth it, but this would be worth paying for if it wasn't free... great game to get you thinking a bit
B005HSL626|5.0|I like this game a lot. I have had this app a while now and the only ads I have seen have been appropriate. the kids I babysit love to play it.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|The movie was totally inaccurate. However for the love of Liam I will see anything.. I really liked the wolves but at one point they no longer look like wolves way to big, movement wrong, eyes looked weird. Later I found out they did use in some parts men in wolf suits. That really made me giggle. Its a great action flick if you ignore how these men argue each other to death. The wolves in real life would never challenge them as a group over territory that was just silly. The idea that a wolf den would cause such chaos is also silly. The wolves were great except for the ones in suits. The plane crash is excellent best part of the movie worth the price of the ticket. See it for fun I did and I had a good time! Watch out for the men in Wolf suits. You might spot one!
B006X415GK|5.0|I'm an avid collector of Monster High dolls and to say that I was thrilled to find this one at Kmart for only $4.13 is a major understatement!  Monster High dolls in general are beautiful, extraordinarily detailed and have really great overall concepts.  I have all the other dolls in the Skull Shores set and my only complaint about this one is that it was the only one in the collection that didn't come with a little drink accessory.  Her hair comes plastered down, which I hate, but a bit of shampoo and warm water and it was soft, lovely and brushable.<br /><br />Please note that these dolls are fragile and come with VERY small pieces.  I would recommend these for collectors and older children.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Constantly freezes (often not enough time to even get one level in) on ASUS Transformer Prime running ICS.  Great game when it does work though (I do wish they would bump up the resolution a little, but it doesn't look terrible.)<br />Edit:  Freezing problem on ICS onward has been fixed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A peaceful puzzle game with great music, this game is fun yet calming, very zen and soothing music with  great thought provoking puzzles
B007HJ9NBE|2.0|I can see why the movie did not do so well in the movie theater, I was hoping to see Julian do more danciing
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it better than tiny village. it is very action packed and exciting. fun for all ages and very enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a great read, once you get into a few chapters its hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone age 14 and up!
B006WXW098|5.0|Technically beyond brilliant. Interpretively sensitive and stunning. Amazingly comprehensive in material chosen for the CD. I thought it would be a fabulous recording before I bought it, little knowing just how fabulous it is! She's the equal of Argerich and Horowitz in her early twenties, hard to imagine how amazing she will be when she fully matures as an artist-she is getting close now..........
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Jeff Nichols' new film, \\"Take Shelter\\" is a marvelous example of what happens when a group of talented people come together to tell a smart story and make a good film, despite the fact that few will see it and even fewer will appreciate it. I already know not everyone likes this movie, there are other comments right here that in no uncertain terms say so, some even yell so, this is, of course, because the movie is something of a challenge for many viewers. It plays out as a mystery, we've already lost many people here brought up on Hollywood effects driven blockbusters that explains it all in the trailers, a psychological drama and a character study, it is what is missing so often today at the multiplex or new on Netflix, an adult thriller aimed at a willing audience.<br /><br />Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, a relative newcomer with only one other film under his belt, [[ASIN:B0016MJ6I8 Shotgun Stories]] which played at Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival a few years back, Nichols writes a compelling script that translates into a gripping movie where things may not be what they seem, or as we the audience begin to care, we fear that they are what they seem and we don't like what we see. This works largely because of the fine acting of Michael Shannon, a great actor giving one of his greatest performances as the central character, Curtis. Curtis is a working class midwesterner who as the movie begins is plagued by a continuing series of nightmares about a coming near apocalyptic storm. Jessica Chastain is equally good, just how many good performances did she give in 2011, as Samantha, Curtis' loving wife, she gives the character the proper empathy to emote reactions from the viewer, we can see through her that sometimes being the witness can be the harder thing to have to be.<br /><br />The only major flaw I can find with the movie is that it is perhaps drawn out a little bit too much. There are those who will, and do find the leisurely way the film unfoldsto be boring, I think a lot of these people are too caught up in the modern era of instant gratification. When one is brought up on video games and movies based on such or easily transformed to the medium, expecting patience is difficult, if not all together futile. However, I do think that a small amount of tightening up in the center of the film might have made it's flow a little more gripping.<br /><br />The ending is the kind that I normally hate in a movie like this, it is ambiguous, I don't have a problem with ambiguity, but the way it is played sometimes can test a viewer's tolerance. Here though, I don't believe that to be the case. The ending seems to me to be the exact right conclusion, and it knows when to stop. I had a strong emotional reaction to this film, in no small part due to the near brilliance of the movie's final ten minutes or so.<br /><br />For the right audience, this is one of the best films of 2011. It is also the best thriller in a long time, period. I hope beyond all hope it finds a good audience, critical reaction has been up to this point, mostly favorable. In fact, many were surprised by Shannon's omission from the Oscar race. I say see it and I look forward to future films from this talent new filmmaker.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is very reminiscent of Mario,  which  is a good thing.  The gameplay will seem familiar to anyone who has played mario or mario 3.  Very enjoyable.
0446581348|1.0|I read this whole book expecting that the next page, or the next page would actually have something of use. This was written for 14 year olds who also want to be makeup artists one day. And wtf is with the blush? And the white under the eyes? I love bobbi brown's products but this is just bad. Here, let me give you all of the information in the book in one sentence: moisturize regularly for your appropriate skin type and follow the directions on the makeup packaging for application. Bam. Now where's MY 30 bucks?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really love this game. it is easy and fun to play. I love grafics...they are really cute and make the game interesting. love the old west theam...and is is educational.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really great puzzle game. Simple design and a great challenge trying to get a perfect score on every level! I will definitely buy future releases if they are anything like this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not ususally a sci-fi reader but I picked this up on a recommendation from a friend and am sure glad I did.  This was a very compelling story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and great value for only $4!?!?  I can't wait for the continuation of this series.  Keep up the good work!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading thousands of books, this will be my first review ever. Review is maybe a big word, it will be more a recommendation.<br /><br />But please, I had to give this book 5 stars for several reasons:<br />1. Making more people buy this book<br />2. Making more people enjoy this incredible story<br />2. This book will be a classic<br />3. By having more reviews, making this book more noticed<br /><br />Thanx to Hugh for this incredible gripping story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games trilogy. I think it's an excellent series for any age. You don't have to be young to appreciate the story and it isn't written above anyone's head.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is almost the same a Mario bros....it keeps myself and my son entertained! !!! very enjoyable! !!! definitely recommended for all ages!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|angry birds space is awesome but I hats that the opossum have danger zone and the kindle fire doesn't... its sad that they would charge 3 dollars when we only get 2 worlds.....
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lep's world is such a good game! its like the leprechaun version of Mario. graphics are great and the controls are quite simple. a really great game. I was honestly surprised that it was free. great game really. it keeps me entertained for hours.
0553386794|1.0|George R. R. Martin writes well; some of his earlier works are engaging and captivating.  Which leaves little excuse for this series.  It is a story mired in filth and obscenity and shines the light on the worst conditions of human experience and offers them up as plot lines, dialogue and personal, social and political interactions.<br /><br />For those that want a fantasy/sci-fi story, this series is not for you.  Although there are dragons, dire wolves and other various fantasy elements thrown into the storyline, they are secondary to what is taking place; the fantasy elements are obligatory color for an otherwise drab world.  Through five novels, Martin's audience is treated to what I would like to call a dark, sad attempt at a Harlequin romance novel instead of an engaging fantasy story; however, that would insult the Harlequin novel genre, so the audience is left to call it what it is: trash.<br /><br />For plot lines, we have incest, rape, murder, extremely gratuitous violence, deception, betrayal and, to whet the appetite even further, more rape.  The actions of the varied protagonists represent the lowest forms of human behavior.  I cannot even begin to fathom Martin's impetus to start or even want to finish this series; perhaps that is why it took six years to get the fifth offering published, he could not understand it, either.<br /><br />One of the reviews said that the characters are engaging.  I call foul on that one.  The characters might have a chance to be engaging if: 1) They stuck around long enough to engage you; 2) The POV did not change so often; and 3) They were believable.  It seems as if Martin deliberately destroys a character just to prove he can do it, especially if that character offers balance, decency and justice in his world.<br /><br />Overall, this seemed to be an attempt to write the fantasy equivalent of a dark Harlequin novel, at which it failed, due to its utter lack of redeeming virtues; the characters are flat, throwaway chess pieces whose only draw is that they die violently, or are rendered ineffective in some horrific manner or are caught up in the basest of human emotions; and the storytelling is something I expect from an average sophomore English student in college, not an established writer.  If I could give the series a half a star, I would.  I honestly do not understand how anybody in their right mind could compare Martin to Tolkien based on this series; what an insult to Tolkien and his legacy.<br /><br />If this is the latest and best that George R. R. Martin has to offer, I suggest a career change, perhaps the editors of the dark and trashy magazine, Heavy Metal, need a new writer...pieces whose only draw is that they die violently, or are rendered ineffective in some horrific manner or are caught up in the basest of human emotions; and the storytelling is something I expect from an average sophomore English student in college, not an established writer.

1451627289|3.0|I love Uncle Stevie, and as much as I found this an enjoyable read, I had one MAJOR problem with this book. The entire premise is faulty. Why? Because the main character struggles over his decision to kill LHO before he can assassinate Kennedy. He goes so far as to try to prove he's guilty before taking on the task, and he fights with himself over whether or not it's the right thing to do.<br /><br />The problem? Oswald is going to die no matter WHAT happens. Sure, he gets an extra couple of days--in custody, as the most hated man in America, perhaps for all time. So, if our narrator kills him and he's innocent of the Kennedy killing, he's actually doing Oswald a favor by sparing him from the \\"false\\" accusation. If he's guilty, he does what he sets out to do: try and prevent the Kennedy killing. Either way, it works out.<br /><br />It's not as if LHO is going to live a long and happy life. No, he's going to die anyway. So why all the fuss? I just could never get past that one simple fact.
B004T32SOK|4.0|I would recommend this app for people who need online storage space. Easy to use. Works well with the Kindle Fire.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This album is super and the more you listen to her sing, the more of Adele you want to hear.  Her audience responds to her songs \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" and \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" is amazing.  The audience seems to know all the words to her songs.
B004KKX80A|3.0|when i saw the package i was happy but then i saw the bey.the tip was not red for some reason and if i launch the bey head on to another bey the rubber falls off :( the ll2 was kinda bad. not sooo bad that it didnt work but it was kinda hard to launch.it a very cool bey but i got a bad one :(
B000H6SXMY|1.0|This friends set was such a waste. The quality is horrible and almost every CD skips. And not just little skipping, it will skip entire episodes. Or multiple sections of an episode at a time. It's terrible. I hate that I have to spend more money on another set.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun casual game and it was free for the day! just slide the raindrops around obsicals to win. don't know what else to say. its fun!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I enjoyed the book. I try to read the same books my grandson does so we can discuss them. We both enjoyed this one and can't wait til the next in the series comes out. It's always fun to see what Percy Jackson is up to, along with meeting new characters.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I like this game but it costs 3$ an I hat paying I got it for free on my droid this is stupid
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lots of fun. Highly recommended. Puzzles are challenging but not frustrating.  Plenty of &quot;aha! &quot; moments that will keep you hooked.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|After first reading a sample, I immediately bought the book as I couldn't put it down! I finished the book in a day which is also very sad as I didn't want to stop reading about them!<br />The characters are all loveable. There is nothing wrong with the book - other than some minor grammar but that's ok.<br />There are some sexual parts in the book but nothing too in depth that would make you blush and giggle like a school girl.<br />I highly recommend this book. You won't regret it! x
B000X2H8G4|5.0|My son was born with a moderate hearing loss and has been in speech therapy his whole life. He tried using hearing aids as a baby but would not keep them in and hated things around his ears. When we went to a different child SLP she mentioned using this product to get him use to having things on his ears so he would be able to get hearing aids when he was a little older. It worked amazingly! Not only did he now realize what it was like to actually HEAR what his speech therapist (and mom) was saying but also learned some things you don't initially like can be good for you. Within about 4 months of using this just at his SLP appointments and when practicing at home (so about 5hrs/wk) he got his second pair of hearing aids (at age 4) and has been doing amazing. He has had no problems keeping them in and is enjoying learning and hearing new things. This was a great transition tool.<br />One word of advice though if you use this for children...get smaller headphones specifically for children because the ones that come with it are too large. We just went to Toys R Us and got his favorite character (Cars) headphones to make it that much more appealing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you i love that it is also audio thank you so much for this app i am planning on reading and listening tothe whole bible God bless.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good. some of them are challenging which is good. I like this game. it is good. it is cool that there are so many to choose from.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun and challenging puzzle game. Not really sure what the theme is about but very fun none the less.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I, along with many others, thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  As with many adaptations of Edgar Rice Burroughs' stories, some of the elements are slightly altered, but so what?  I'm just glad to finally see a decent presentation of one of my favorite characters.  I won't rehash the plot of the movie; the small changes didn't take away from the story.  In fact, some of them were rather clever.  I got to see this on an IMAX screen, and it was a wonderful experience.  I've been a huge Burroughs' fan ever since the 1960s when I discovered the Ace and Ballantine paperbacks.  Of course the Frank Franzetta and Roy Krenkel and Abbett covers helped to fuel the need to buy and read every book I could get my hands on.  Although we've had to wait a long, long time for this movie, it was well worth it.  I will buy it when it comes out on Blu-Ray/DVD.<br /><br />I know that a lot of the movie goers really aren't familiar with the source materials.  What would have been really nice would have been for some of the book stores/comic shops to have put on a display of some of the books, comics, and magazines from the which the original stories came.  I would have loved to have seen lots of Burroughs' materials on display in the movie lobby.  There are so many, many examples that people could have seen.  You know: see the movie then go buy the books and discover so much more like Tarzan and the Venus stories and, of course, the other Barsoom stories.  Some of the public libraries could also have put up some displays of the movie tie-in books.<br /><br />Lots of missed opportunities to link the movie to the original author.<br /><br />Disney could have also done a lot more with the promoting of this movie and the merchandising.<br /><br />And the movie was a lot of fun!
B003K1EYM6|3.0|Good connector to have, specially on trips, when you can discharge your pics on the iPad. But i find it slow to take in the pictures. On the usb, I have not been able to import anything, since the ipad wouldn,t even recognize it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I tried this as it was a free application. I was pleasantly surprised to find it's a great program. Challenging and fun. Each level requires a bit more thought. I'm glad I tried this application and was only prompted once to provide a review.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I loved Fight Club, the movie.  The book was every bit as wonderful. The movie script did make some changes to the story, but nothing that harmed the flow of the narrative. The story will be something that I come back and reread for years to come.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's okay.  passes time away...pretty easy to pass level.  my son likes to play...he doesn't lose too much which is good.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A beautiful and well made application, with simple yet challenging game play. Contains a pleasant soundtrack. I highly recommended this game.
B00004CZA7|1.0|This dvd does not play at all..blank disc did not play on any dvd player..or nintendo system or computer.. Not happy tht i lost my $$
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|I liked the books, I LOVE the show.  The books tend to be long winded and broken up, and it was hard to keep track off all the players.  This took the best parts of the books and reduced them to a thoroughly enjoyable series.  Can't wait for season two to be posted!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|going good as of yet I see no problems, game play is slightly sluggish at times and you always click on trees by accident
B000X418UE|5.0|Nicolas Cage deserved a second Best Actor nomination for his bang-on portrayal of the legendary WWF champion in this entertaining, family-friendly biopic. Brimming with heart and wholly inspiring, THE ROCK is the best \\"feel good\\" flick since THE KARATE KID III. Don't miss it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Neat game to pass the time.  You can strategize or just play for fun.  Different than anything I've played.  Excellent and it was free!
B0055SWM08|5.0|i think it is a fun game but I wish it had more levels and was free as an over all
B007PTJOV0|3.0|its ok.i mean i got bc of my friend.but its kind of pretty cool if u like games like mario.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is cheesy fun. waiting for more energy to play is the only bad part as I am not patient.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check this app everyday and I can be prepared for whatever weather I might come in contact with. its fantastic
B003UESJHE|3.0|Well, the Blu-ray DVD will not play on my DVD player due to the region code of my player even though it´s a Blu-ray. I still have to find out about this. Otherwise it arrived in time and in good condition
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive fun! Great puzzle levels start easy and get hard, even when they look super simple! On my hacked nook color and razor maxx with no issues!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game will make you think and have fun doing it. This will be one of the games I play first thing after I wake up to get my brain ready for the day!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!App makes studying the  Bible a breeze.  Great app for those who don't want to carry their Bible around all the time.. It  is a great app has its flaws like all the others  but helps  with easy navigation  during service.  Also makes it easier to use the different. versions.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a great, addicting game with soothing music and tones :) It is very relaxing, yet challenging to play.
1455121924|4.0|The world is full of food villains & wacko theories today.  I never would have purchased this book if my Dr. had not recommended it.  That being said, I am so glad he did.<br /><br />Whether wheat is your pariah or not, it seems to have been mine.  Since cutting out wheat -- it's only been about a month now -- my undiagnosed body inflammation (and Oh, did I pay dearly for all those lab tests to tell me what it wasn't) is dramatically reduced, my metabolism is more even, food satisfies much longer, no more glycemic crashes and more energy.  I'm looking forward to what the next month will bring.<br /><br />I purchased the audio book and the first few disks were easy to follow.  Then comes the tsunami of science.  It's good in the sense that his findings are documentable, but my eyes did glaze over at times.  In the end, I do feel he went a bit overboard blaming virtually every ailment of the day on wheat (by its effect of exacerbating all manor of health conditions).<br /><br />All that being said, the book presents very solid arguments as to why there has been such an explosion of obesity & physical diseases in the last 50 years.  The book starts with the evolution of the modern franken-wheat, moves to the devastating effects on the body and is supported throughout by science & studies.  There is also a CD of wheat free recipes.<br /><br />And, most importantly, it's working as stated.
0439023491|4.0|This was another page turner but book 1 was definitely better.  The ending of this book certainly took me by surprise.
B0055SWM08|5.0|can't put this down once you start.  very peaceful music.  could play for hours. can't beat the price either.  you will not regret this addition to your Android game library.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|ALthough we get to finally come to encounter President Snow at the capitol I think it was a little rushed.  Gale gets to play a more prominent part and we see Peeta in a different light.  It is definitely sad but I think she ended up with the right person.
1609410416|4.0|I got this audio book mostly because it's read by Ellen DeGeneres. I love her, I think she's hilarious, and so I thought that she'd be great to listen to as if she were putting on a show on CD. This is not the case.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as much as I love Ellen, her audio book sounds stilted like, well, she's READING it. The jokes are a little like jokes you plant in a speech that has a monotonous edge to it that totally ruins the entire thing.<br /><br />The entire book wasn't like that, but the lead up to the punch line falls flat when she can't get that \\"I'm reading you a funny joke but I have to be careful I don't spit in the microphone so I'm going to read with one tone of voice for places I might spit whilst laughing\\" out of her voice! It's so frustrating!<br /><br />The book itself was a compilation of seemingly random chapters, some very short and some long. There's a long period of silence for a `meditation' period as well as one chapter she says `hey, look in the printed copy because we're gonna skip reading them here' (this is the `text lingo' chapter). Luckily, I had access to the book, but it's kind of a waste of your time to try and track it down. There's also a chapter that is all about sounds which is perfect for the audio book and not so much for the printed version.<br /><br />Plus, it's short. I mean, REALLY short. Like we're talking three hours short. And I honestly didn't like it enough to listen to it again. It is definitely a woman-empowering book and some of the chapters I laughed out loud but most I really wanted to skip.<br /><br />I'd borrow it from the library before you decide to buy the audio book. But a decent read nonetheless.
0439023521|5.0|When I first heard about the book I was against reading it but my daugthters convinced me I would like it and they were right.  It is a fast moving book and well written.  I liked the idea that you didn't get a lot of gory details when someone dies.  Looking forward to book 2 of the trilogy.
0312641893|5.0|Cinder was what I expected and what I wasn't expecting. I expected a parallel to the Cinderella tale (which, obviously, is what the book is built upon) but I wasn't expecting such liberties to be taken with the story. They were well plotted liberties, even if the main basis of the story was so dreadfully predictable. The whole \\"The princess has been missing\\" bit brought to Cinder's attention about twenty-five pages in was just screaming \\"THIS IS WHAT THIS PLOT IS ABOUT. PLEASE TAKE NOTE.\\" However, I found I didn't overly mind the predictability part simply because of the inventive spices added to a common fairy tale.<br /><br />Enter the existence of cyborgs, mutant humans living on the moon, and a very strange plague. Being a pre-med student with a focus in diseases, I naturally found many flaws in this sickness. For it to be the basis of unrest it needed to be a little less mysterious than it was. The science mentioned was mediocre at best, but this is a work of fantasy and not exclusively a science fiction novel. Meyer wasn't so ignorant as to build weak plot threads, so this wasn't much of an issue. I personally appreciated the mechanics of the cyborg people, which was a little more solid than the plague itself.<br /><br />I literally tore through this book in a day. I do not recommend doing that, as this book mimics the \\"middle book of a trilogy\\" syndrome. Simply put, you get a lot of information but nothing substantial to feel like you were granted anything in the story. Yes, it was good with fairly solid characters (most of them tolerable to possibly engaging) but in the end you really get nothing. Nothing from the main points of the story line was accomplished. I kind of felt cheated because I read through four hundred or so pages and wasn't even tossed a bone for my efforts. If the book had ended in a better cliff hanger, one where I could enjoy what had just happened and reflect on it until the next book up heaves my satisfaction, I think I would have felt better about it. It was almost like Meyer wanted to give us more story and sacrificed a good place to \\"end\\" the first installment. It was like drinking watery tea versus a shot of caffeine; yes the tea will last you longer but the caffeine will give you the immediate satisfaction.<br /><br />I did think the book had a well rounded build, hence the five stars, but I just felt like I was lead asunder. I will read the next book, but I doubt I will keep this series in the long run unless I can glean more satisfaction from the characters or the plot. I'd pick it up at the library first to make sure you like what you read before you fork over money for the hardback.better about it.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A very moving, character driven novel. If you know nothing about other parts of the world and how other women live, this will open your eyes. The characters are unforgetable and will forever remain in my heart.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|The movie is funny and enjoyable. The characters are interesting and adorable. And gives you a lesson in life.  Worth watching.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Super fun game! plays well on the kindle fire. graphics are good. overall 5/5 stars! Easy to figure out instructions
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love this game :) it seems alot like the mario games i used to play on the computer. but now on my kindle fire :) i was looking for a game like mario and this is it!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It so very similar to Mario. My seven year old son loves to play it. The boards are fairly easy.
B005T87QCI|2.0|it needs to have atom and zues the it would be a lot better irony like it the way it is
1609419693|5.0|I am not big on writing reviews and I'm definitely not gifted with words, but I'm going to give it a shot anyway! I really enjoyed this book. I read a handful of the negative comments and was surprised by some of the supposed Tina lovers that didn't like it. It definitely jumps around, but I didn't really mind that at all. My bottom line is basically that if you like Tina Fey and enjoy her writing and movies, then you will, more than likely, enjoy this book. I did listen to the audiobook as I took a walk each day and I don't feel I would have enjoyed the book as much. Hearing it in Tina's voice really brought it home for me.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|this app is ok i guess its time consuming and boring if you play it by itself if u download other similar games and play them simultaneusly its kind of entertaining. If you want to kill time i guess its ok .. all you do is wait for food to me done  you really dont do anything but make food and buy more things to make food in .its boring .
B0055SWM08|3.0|I like it, pretty addicting game!! nice change from the normal free app of the day. great graphic and controls.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lobe this app it's fun! I play it all the time and I haven't gotten bored yet! You should get this becauseits such a cute game.
0345803485|1.0|There was so much hype about this book, I thought it would be different, but it's boring, the characters are so young, he's so condescending, she's so naive..\\"oh my!\\" God I couldn't stand it, I threw it away. What was all the fuss<br />about? I don't know...It's not literature.. the writing was juvenile, something a school girl would write.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool game in the kindle fire there are a lot but this is one of my favorite ones it is cool
B0072GPQNG|2.0|It starts out with a boy trying to get close to a horse that doesn't want to get close to him.  The next ting you know, the horse is being auctioned off, and there's a bidding war on this thoroughbred by two men who we know nothing about, nor do we know why they want the horse so badly.  The man who wins the bid for the horse brings him home and it turns out that he's the father of the boy who always tried to get close to the horse, so I'm thinking he bought the horse as a gift for his son.  Not the case.  It turns out that he's a poor farmer needing a workhorse to help plow the fields, so his wife is mad because they are renters and he's just spent all of their rent money on a non-working horse. Why didn't he buy a workhorse?  So, right from the beginning, you're left with a bunch of questions and no answers and a race horse that lives on a farm where  it doesn't belong.  The father has almost no dialogue, and he takes a sip from a flask a few times throughout the movie, and from that we're supposed to figure out that he's a drunk.  The camera is always panning in on him, but he doesn't speak, so we have to read his mind and figure out who he is.  There was no building up of the characters, and the whole landlord character could've been left out, since it had nothing to do with storyline, and the town coming to watch the horse try to plow was stupid.  Very poorly done.  I wish I had rented it first at Redbox instead of buying it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Me and my wife really enjoyed sitting down and watching this. Really get caught up in the characters. Found the war scenes well done, but a little shallow. Everything looks great in blue ray hd.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am really impressed. it's a cute game. probably one of the best free games ever. good graphics. try itbfor yourself. (played on kindle fire)
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Disclaimer (or claimer, as the case may be): I am a SERIOUS trekkie.<br /><br />I have to say, having sampled just a few first-season episodes of the remastered series ... I'm iffy on this. The space effects look cartoony and cheap, though still prettier than the original series. That said, the clarity of the set pieces itself is very nice, a bit better than the first issue of the three-season boxed set, which I purchased a few years back. I'm not sure this is really much of an improvement over the first package set of all three seasons. It depends on your tolerance for very obvious CGI. If you can overlook the cartoonish effects of the space shots, you will probably appreciate the good quality of the actual set pieces showing the actors. I would say, if you don't have all three seasons on DVD yet and are comfortable with CGI touchups, go with this set. If you're NOT comfortable with CGI touchups, you'll be very happy with the non-remastered three-series set. I considered getting rid of the old set if I really liked this remastered set. Having sampled it, I plan to keep the old set.<br /><br />Edit to add: Working my way through the second season and I'm generally pleased with (or inured to?) the CGI. A couple of episodes have CGI that actually slightly enhances the experience (e.g., Amok Time and The Doomsday Machine - and thank the Great Bird, they did NOT screw up the ice cream cone. That would have been a mortal sin - the ice cream cone is iconic. They just touched it up some). I still plan to keep my unremastered set, though, so my first observation still stands.<br /><br />Note: Stupid, stupid, STUPID to put the episode guide on several separate cards rather than one card or a booklet. Packaging gets a minus 10 for impracticality (cheap plastic box already broken, crappy cardboard sleeve). Sheesh. Put the episode lists ON the disks, for heaven's sake. How hard is this, after two decades of DVDs?
B0055SWM08|5.0|sooooo fun I couldn't stop playing this game untill the pop up asked me to rate it. but this game is very fun.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it is fun but when you die you have to start the world over but is like Mario world which is cool
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire a couple days ago. It was very fun at first, but yesterday started the problems. My energy won't refill, it says all crops will mature in 26 days, and it freezes- I have to shutdown my Kindle just to be able to exit the game. I am also unsure how to add neighbors- one of the missions is to visit 5 neighbors towns. This is similar to Pioneer Trail on Facebook. It was very fun to play the first few days and I hope they get the kinks worked out.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This series followed the book to great detail, although some minor things had to be changed for tv, it still remained true to form. Excellent casting also makes the story jump out at you. We watch it all in 2 night, just couldn't stop.
B004OTZV0W|2.0|Now I do understand why this particular re-issue by Music on Vinyl cost so much less on the market.This re-issue sounds horrible .My regular Atlantic copy sounds much better.This one lacks details, bass,middle range is muffed, etc.etc.I would not dare to try other re-issues of ELP my MoV.A pity though-I was really looking forward to a better experience.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I LOVE this game. What keeps me from giving it a 5 star is not knowing how to add neighbors and the long energy refill wait. Other than that&hellip;I love playing it. It can be compared to frontierville on facebook.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Good except for the difficult levels and the challenge is in the puzzle itself just think... If your up for it.
B00002N9ER|3.0|Always know where your flashlight is with these handy clips.  Works on most \\"D\\" cell flashlights in either the horizontal or vertical position.  One clip is sufficient for a 2-cell flashlight.  I keep one one the wall by the garage door so I always know where the flashlight is.  It would work equally well in a car, truck, boat, or camper.  I am thinking about mounting one on my bike handlebars :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|absolutely love it. the best thing I have never paid for. its a roided up version of farmville. its amazing.
0446556750|4.0|It's one of the golden rules of mystery fiction:  the person who looks guilty at the beginning of the book is rarely the actual culprit.  Of course, Michael Connelly - one of the premier mystery writers working today - is good enough to break the rules when necessary.  So is Jason Jessup guilty of killing a young girl?  Maybe.  Even if so, can he be found guilty in court?<br /><br />That is the task of series character Mickey Haller, the so-called Lincoln Lawyer (who generally uses his car as his office).  Jessup was originally convicted in the 1980s, but after he is granted a retrial due to new DNA evidence, Haller is asked to be an independent prosecutor on the retrial.  Haller is normally a defense attorney, but he agrees under certain conditions:  his ex-wife Maggie - who is a prosecutor - gets to be his second chair, and his lead investigator gets to be Harry Bosch (Connelly's principal series character).<br /><br />While it seems likely that Jessup is actually guilty, proving it a quarter-century after the last trial will be difficult.  Bosch is an astute detective and can turn up new evidence; Haller is good at working trials.  The story is essentially a courtroom thriller, though like most such stories, it takes a while to get to the actual trial.<br /><br />The book follows Bosch and Haller in alternate chapters.  As with other Haller stories, the chapters about Mickey are told in the first person; the Bosch chapters are told with a third person point-of-view (which is the case with most Bosch novels).  Although they occupy around equal space in the story, the different narrative styles make this more of a Haller book; the reader will more closely identify with him.<br /><br />For most writers, this would be five-star material, but I hold Connelly to a higher standard.  Though most of the book is good, it falters toward the end, though in ways I can't describe without spoilers.  This is not Connelly's best book, but it will be good enough for most mystery fans.
B0055SWM08|5.0|When I first started the game, I was reminded of the first time I played Sokoban.  I enjoyed (wasted?) many hours playing Sokoban. I suspect I'll do that with Quell, too.  Nice implementation.  I'm not experiencing the display problems a few have reported.  HTC Rezound.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Similar to some other games but still fun. Levels start getting challenging in the 3rd world. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it.
0767802470|5.0|I was concerned about watching a movie with subtitles.  After the first 2 minutes I did not even realize that I was doing it.  We were total captured and engrossed into the movie.  We watched it again the next day.  After taking the tour through the U505 at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry we were intrigued.  The suspense and drama kept us on the edge of our seat.  One of the best movies I have ever watched.
0345803485|5.0|I heard about the book from a friend but she wouldn't tell me much about it. I was shocked at times but behind the thrilling sex was always the flawed characters who kept me interested. I highly enjoyed this book as well as its sequel! I'm currently reading the last in the trilogy and already wishing there were more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I already had &quot;Reflect&quot; and happy to report that I am not disappointed with its predecessor. I also like the design.
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is the best game ever - great on kindle fire and if u want an amazing thinker that at the same time is fun at the same time ... this game is for you
B004EPZ03O|3.0|Well, with only Dave Goelz (Gonzo) the remaining member of the big five Muppet performers of the Seventies (founder Jim Henson, Frank Oz, Jerry Nelson and Richard Hunt being the others) taking part in this production, many of these lovable characters are missing their original voices, and longtime fans will definitely feel a sense of unbalance. Still, this movie remains diverting entertainment, and the songs aren't bad at all, thanks to the talents of Flight Of The Conchords man Bret McKenzie. I could list a dozen things about the film that don't quite work, but in the end, this a good film for kids, and at the very least might make a few of them take an interest in watching DVDs of \\"The Muppet Show\\" with their nostalgic parents.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well the first 'curse words' of the chapter some it up &#34;damn&#34; this &#34;double crap&#34;. I skimmed and wasted time of my life. Please do no read this book i don't care who you are you have better things to do.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I enjoyed this set of books very much. I found myself engulfed and could not put them down. They were so well written and the story was so easy to follow.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game, very addictive. I have yet to experience the pixel issues other users have reported, but ive only been playing for ten minutes
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I tried reading it but got up to only 12% and then deleted out of my kindle.I wanted to see what the hype was all about but I guess I'll never know. I just couldn't continue reading it. I know I didn't get to the sex scenes but I just couldn't bear reading anymore of the writing. I know I am the minority here but I had to just voice my opinion.
0061148512|4.0|I can't believe it took me so long to read this book. I was thoroughly engrossed by the character's battle with depression, her increasing apathy towards life, and her keen observations about the world around her.
B00785P2QC|5.0|excellent game having a lot of fun so far great controls very fun and its free been playing it for an hour
B00753MBHA|5.0|Attention all metalheads!  Accept has again produced another metal masterpiece.  Again you say?  If you own their last release \\"Blood of the Nations\\", you already know what I am talking about.  If you don't own it, what are you waiting for???  \\"Stalingrad\\" picks up where \\"Blood of the Nations\\" left off in the sense that it is all killer with no filler.  Every track is strong and sounds great with Andy Sneap once again producing.  Mark Tornillo once again dazzles on vocals and Wolf Hoffman continues to prove why he is held in such high regard as a guitar god in the metal world (Pick up his solo Classical album if you can!).  This is another album of the year candidate from Accept that you need to hear!
B00785P2QC|4.0|nice strategy game though a bit hard in the beginning but good for those that come on often like not for those who want really fast or really slow more for the moderate speed
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I wish it didn't end. Excellent book- best Nicholas Sparks book ever. The movie that is coming out is going to be amazing. I am very happy I read this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Awesome game that continues the Oregon Trail story! I loved the original Oregon Trail and now I don't. have to wonder what happens to them.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy the game,  its pretty entertaining. And being able to share my progress on facebook is cool, as well as having my friends play along with me.
B0071BY1ZQ|5.0|Brad Mehldau is always superb. It's a beautiful recording that would appeal both to jazz lovers and to others. Bears repeated playings without becoming boring.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|All of the charactures are immature and childish to the extreme.  I know they are only 19, but my goodness what excessively dumb 19 year olds these are.. and why on earth would anyone want to read about them?<br /><br />Stalker in training who can only be saved by the love of a good woman?  What possible life trouble could there be in that?  Every evening and activity begins and ends with alcohol..what possible life trouble could there be in that?<br /><br />The Vegas/mob stuff was just stupid and awkwardly done.  I did not care about any of these charactures.  I wish I could get back the time I wasted on this book.<br /><br />The only good thing is that I did not spend much money!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I got Bag It! on Christmas ,when I got my kindle, and this is the only thing I played since then.At first I didn't get it and kept smashing things.Then, I tear the instructions and I was like ohhh that's how you do it and my sister said yeah didn't you read the instructions.
0345529057|3.0|these books have some of the thinnest paper I have ever seen in a book.  It is similar to cheap tissue paper.<br /><br />the price was OK, I would not have bought the books because of the cheap paper if I had looked at it in a store.<br /><br />there are blurbs and banners about HBO on every book, and every part of the book holder/box.<br />\\"Game of Thrones.  A new original series from HBO\\", all over everything.<br /><br />The book holder/box is very thin cardboard material, it will not hold up over time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I just simply love this game. It really sets the ability to do activities without having to pay money for everything. Recomend this to everyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good graphics.  Good gameplay.  Like the trophies/achievements. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing random games that aren't ridiculously easy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the points not addition up to the next level of games is a bit aggravating but overall its amusing, not the best thing ive ever played but keeps you entertained.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! passes the time away and very addictive. I highly reccommend this game to everyone :) it has many different games all in one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is lots of fun I love playing it all the time my land is huge and j love it so much fun
B0055SWM08|5.0|easy to play but enough challange not to be boring or mindless.  makes you want to keep going to the next level.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Android market has a newer version of the game, but it includes ads.  Otherwise its a great game. The game play is very cool
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game I like how you can fish and hunt but I don't like how almost everything costs cash like the five worms cost 5 cash
B006W0QOF2|2.0|The movie was very disappointing for me.  I am a car nut and one of the car chases was excellent but the remainder of the movie was either boring or very bloody. I don't know how anyone could rate this 5 stars.
B004XVN1T4|2.0|Readers acquainted with the mature Follett will certainly miss his usual geo-political even-handedness here.  Besides, the episode of the seizing of a small ship carriyng uranium by an israeli commando is based on a physical impossibility: the vessel is at anchor at large, in the middle of the Mediterranean.  Come on, only oil rigs can lay anchor in high seas...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app... it's like Super Mario Bros. meets Lucky Charms! LOL!  I give it all five stars. Check it out for yourself
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun and relaxing......easy to play...good mind exercises to keep you sharp....that is all I have to say for now. bye
B004KD5TQI|5.0|this is a very good movie and an excellent sound track. all songs a nice mix of old and new music. if you like sound track compilations this is for you
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love it because when I'm at work and bored its so time consuming and just makes the day fly by. plus it really makes you think.
B0055SWM08|5.0|So very addictive! I can't put this down! Like a bag of lays, once you start you just can't stop!
0061120073|4.0|I used this for a book club and it was an excellent choice.  I wasn't sure it was going to be a success but the members enjoyed it. There are so many controversial topics and differences in lifestyle from that era to today that it really facilitates great discussions. The questions in the back of the book that are provided for use in book clubs were great.
B0042UFWES|5.0|i haven't heard the complete double fantasy in over 30 years and listening to the new remix is like meeting an old friend who had a nose job.<br /><br />i say that in a nice way.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I'm starting to get an error message after each time i click on play/submit then the game closes and i have to reopen the game.  message something about process @zynga.words.com then the game shuts down......irratating!!!!!!'
B00006RIO7|5.0|love the movie and the music.  Musical follows the story line perfectly. Costumes are gorgeous, singers beautiful and acting is supurb.  Definitely a collector's treasure.
0736624643|5.0|This item was returned, so I am not able to write a review for it. I bought it for a friend who decided he didn't want the product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|that is the most coolest game ever hi my name is coolman Jojo's darn shake man you are a lifetimes full of fun
B007CMD5AQ|3.0|After a solid debut album and several EPs Halestorm finally gets around to making a second full-length album and it seems the dreaded sophmore slump is in effect. While there are some good heavy rockers like the first single \\"Love Bites (But So Do I)\\" there seem to be a plethora of sappy ballads that almost have a country feel to them and wouldn't sound out of place on a Taylor Swift album. It doesn't help that none of them are even half as memorable as \\"A Familiar Taste of Poison\\" from their first album.<br /><br />I get the feeling that the \\"experts\\" at the band's record label may be meddling a bit too much in what songs are released in hopes that the band gets some crossover radio support. The thing that backs up that theory the most is that the \\"bonus tracks\\" included on the deluxe edition are better than many of the \\"official\\" album tracks, which is a shame since many fans won't get a chance to hear them. The actual order of the songs doesn't help either, with several of the slower songs placed back-to-back. Producer Howard Benson apparently produced the band's first album as well so I'm not sure how much blame he should take for this but somebody dropped the ball here.<br /><br />I'm still a fan of this band and I think they're talented and full of potential, but they need the right person to help them create something fresh and original. Maybe someone like Rick Rubin or Flood or Kevin Shirley. Like I said, I look forward to seeing what these guys are really capable of.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game. it is so fun and calming. Its a very nice puzzle game and great for relieving your stress
1400082773|5.0|It has always been one of my utmost goals to read President Obama's autobiography as not only would it help me understand where he comes from, and also help me better understand where his views and opinions.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is fun to play. I am glad I downloaded it. Love it on my Kindle Fire. A challenging game.
B005HSL626|4.0|In my opinion it's an easy and fun way to send 5 10 min. You have to earn all the blades and back rounds to complete the game. Buy the game.
B0076D20E8|1.0|This was an interesting movie, ruined by Amazons instant viewing quality. For a whole 3 dollars I could have gone out and rented this from freaking blockbuster.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very relaxing game that has a little challenge but not so much that the game becomes more of a pain that relaxing.
B000M2O6AQ|5.0|I have been interested in spirituality for a little while now, watching other videos such as \\"The Secret\\" Also reading books such as \\"Think and Grow Rich - By Napoleon Hill\\" which quotes a sentence stating\\" \\"The world and people are made of 2 things: matter and energy.\\"<br /><br />I am strong believer in the mind-body connection, energy, and that there is a spiritual aspect to ourselves. I did not read the book to compliment this movie, but I watched it all with complete faith and belief in spirituality, and it re-irritates to me important points such as: Trust your gut instinct, give and receive energy, and know the energy of things and people around you. You are a soul, a spirit, non physical, living in a physical body - and you can tap into a infinite number of possibilities and take control of your life. This movie will change the way you view the world and the people whom you have and will come in contact with.<br /><br />Excellent movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is the best game for the kindle fire recommended it to all my friends and will continue to play till I conquer Oregon!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My complaints with book one were mostly solved in book two. I like her less and find him less strange.  It is great escapism and a fun read. Go for it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game offers loads of entertainment for all ages.<br /><br />There are loads of different things to do and I like the tasks assigned
B004SIIBGU|4.0|nice streamlined interface. scales well on phone or tablet. would be better if you could do advanced search/search by description, and pinch zoom photos. add those and I give 5 stars
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i like the game but it sucks you have to wait so long for more energy but overall fun game
B00000J2PH|4.0|Great and enduring songs but the arrangements and her style leave me wanting. But then I am a true folkie so take it with a grain of salt. Obviously one of the greatest albums for it's time to come along as it stayed on \\"the list\\" for many many weeks; so who am I to argue with success. But this is about personal impressions and I prefer for instance Mary Black and of late, Civil Wars.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Lots of people told me how great this book was, so when it went on sale for Kindle  I scooped it up. I have to admit, I kind of like YA novels, especially for sci-fi/fantasy books, because it's easier for my brain to comprehend (if it's written for an 11 year old, I can understand it! *FISTPUMP*). So it made this a very quick read. Although it coincided with the movie release and bowing to pressure from friends, I paused my book halfway to see the movie. I have to say that I prefer the book (another discussion, another forum).<br /><br />I thought the writing was solid and the characters were well-formed. The author makes it easy to root for Katniss through all of the trials and tribulations of the Games and made her very 'human' and relateable so that I found myself often stopping to think \\"oh man, what if that was ME? Could I kill someone?\\" I also enjoyed Peeta more than I thought I would. Lots of people have commented to me that he was whiny or weak but I didn't find that at all. I felt like he was just very accepting of his fate and treated everything very Zen-like (it is what it is). I can understand how some people would read that as weak-willed or even whiny, but I didn't have a problem with him at all.<br /><br />The concept of the Games is an old one (Battle Royale, Running Man, etc.), but I thought this was a fun interpretation and I really enjoyed the stark contrast of the \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" in this future (where Katniss is from Appalachia and her father was a coal miner, but in the Capitol everything is so extremely high-tech). Some of the concepts behind not just the Games but the vision of this future were very smart and I look forward to the rest of the series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love it!  It's a great puzzle game and it makes one think about the logistics of each level, which get progressively harder.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I bought a Kindle for my technically-tentative wife. She has recently had cataract surgery and sometimes doesn't have to wear glasses anymore. The Kindle offers the lighting and screen options to give her the easiest reading ever. How to make it portable in her small purse? Zip sleeve gives protection, gives easy access when jumbled up with other items in her purse or suitcase.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I fear I had quite forgotten this exquisite example of independent film making.  It came up in a search and I was a bit floored by my reaction to seeing it again.  Suffice it to say, the strength of my reaction caused me to buy it.<br /><br />If you like movies with a good story, no explosions, excellent music, heartbreaking emotions and just plain enchantment, do yourself a favor and get this film.  No big names, no big action but a breathtakingly brilliant total package worthy of a Saturday night stay home date, just add take out.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you love the classic super Mario brothers you will love this game!  a lot of fun &amp; addictive too. I certainly recommend this game
B00756GKBA|1.0|I must admit that I was completely turned off when I heard \\"Give Me All Your Lovin'\\" and that may have ruined me for this entire album.  It's quite possibly Madonna's worst single ever. I do quite enjoy \\"Masterpiece\\" and \\"Gang Bang\\", but they aren't enough to salvage the album for me.<br /><br />I can't wait for the tour!  Maybe I'll have a newfound appreciation for the MDNA tracks when she performs them live.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Received the items from the seller in a timely manner. Great book!  Read the book first then just had to see the movie.
1612130585|5.0|The best trilogy I have ever read.  Glad I had all three at once, would not have been able to wait.  Wish e.l. james would write more books about Ana and Christian.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Copy of SMBs but decent copy of it.  I haven't played that many levels but could get boring quickly if game play doesn't get creative and fresh. Probably great for younger kids.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game.  Trying the levels over to get every possible point is fun.  Several people at work play at the same time.  We compare points and speed.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|this app sucks.  it seems not to play anything on my kindle fire.  I think the other reviews are fake just by the way they are worded.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Steig Larson's [[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Book 1 of the Millennium Trilogy]], like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, never intrigued me enough to commit to reading the story. I never had to actually read the Harry Potter books because my nephew Alex was always willing and able to be my dynamic, interactive Cliff Notes while I watched the movies.<br /><br />He could not help me out with Larson's adult novel, so I was on my own until Audible.com came to babysit me with some very fine storytelling thanks to Simon Vance.  Sixteen hours, 20 minutes, and 50 seconds later, I can say I have experienced the story.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo--Lisbeth Salander--is my hero because she mashes her heel into the feet of mean and miserable giants in their handmade leather shoes and custom tailored suits and brings them to their knees, exposing them for what they are and quite severely--however justly--punishing them for it.<br /><br />Salander works for and with Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist recently burned by a source after publishing an expose of a corrupt industrial don. Together, Blomkvist and Salander's passion for the truth and basic human decency take them down some pretty dark roads and into the corrupt heart of a depraved man who enjoys hurting women because he can.  Martin Venger captures, torments, and destroys women because he can and because he gets off on the feeling of godlike power over another human being. Even being caught thrills him. He enjoys having his talent recognized.<br /><br />The passion for cruelty that drives Martin Venger is as unspeakable as it is ordinary. There are Martin Vengers the world over who toy with others' desire to be accepted and loved, who derive a strange pleasure from inflicting pain in others.<br /><br />There are also many Blomkvists and Salanders who hate cruelty, fight back, win, and carry on. We  call it living.  These are the characters who kept me reading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Worth every penny if you like puzzle games. This game will challenge you to think creatively with each and every stage you play.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|It is nice to know that there are classical movies that have a real trama, and hook you for the length of the movie. The section with the additional material is fantastic. I did enjoy it, while I watched it several times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game. i cant get enough. i seriously suggest getting it if your a lover of card games like I am.
0307949508|4.0|Lisbeth Salander is one of the most intriguing characters in modern fiction. She represents what it would be like to do what you want--when you want--without regard to laws, social mores, or personal reputation and to be able to mete out your own version of justice. I especially enjoy the relationship between her and Mikael Blomkvist and loved how Stieg Larsson in this novel portrayed the deepening of their relationship although there was little personal interaction between the two characters.<br /><br />I believe the book would have been more meaningful to me if I were better versed in Sweden's political and cultural issues, but as an author, I admire how Larsson interwove the social and political issues into the mystery; which is what I aspire to do in my novel.<br /><br />This is a good book, although not as good as the first. Even so, midway through until the end, I could not put it down. I look forward to reading the final book and, unfortunately given Larsson's death, the final chapter of Lisbeth Salander.
B007BLEKPM|1.0|When this movie first came out I was a bit leery and decided to pass. When I saw it become available  from Amazon streaming I thought I'd have a look. It just was not a very good film.  The dialogue was silly and  Di Caprio's portrail of the main character was not convincing. I'm glad I didn't pay more to watch it at the theater.
B0013SQP66|5.0|This show is one of the best on Cable Television. The story line, the writing, and the actors are great and will keep your interest so that you will keep coming back for more.
B000OJFV3S|1.0|This is so inaccurate historically it is laughable.  I won't waste any more of my time watching it.  Glad I didn't pay for what I watched.  That would have been daylight robbery.
0553801473|2.0|This is not a \\"dance with dragons\\", it is more like a lame middle school dance where everyone just stands around looking at each other.  There is hardly any plot advancement and Martin introduces new characters with boring story lines instead of bringing existing points of view closer to a logical conclusion.  I'm willing to bet that once the series is completed you could probably skip this book and the fourth one and still have a complete story.  Seriously, what happened?  The first three books were great, now it seems like Martin just doesn't care anymore.  Is this really the best he could come up with after an almost 6 year hiatus since the last book and almost 11 years since he wrote a good book (Storm of Swords)?
B006KX3GXO|2.0|on the kindle fire it does not work as great.  I cant upload pictures from the gallery. so basically I cant do anything.  please fix this portion so I can use this great app. back to my phone I go.......
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I had heard about this book and the series. Purchased them all. I could not put my Ereader down. Hopefully there will be another series like this. Would highly recommend to anyone.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Gerat story for anyone who has not read Jodi Picoult before. However if you have, particularly if you've read 19 minutes, it's a bit of a waste of time. Feels exactly the same as other stories. Same plot, same parent characters, same style of framing things. Not much new here
B0055SWM08|5.0|A game that is easy to learn. Easy to play. Can play anytime. I would recommend to buy. I got it for free, but I would have paid for it.
0439023513|2.0|Definitely Mockingjay is not as good as the other 2 books. (spoiler alert)  Killing off the characters gave the story a twist, especially towards the end.  Katniss seemed out of character compared to the first 2 books.  Does this mean the people in Panem will remmember Katniss as the loony tune who killed Coin instead of Snow?  It got boring in a lot of parts where Katniss ends up in the hospital, drugged up, wandering or hiding in the closet (probably 75% of the book).  I felt it was missing the dynamics of the rebellion and war.  I'm not looking for a fairy tale ending; I would appreciate some substance or depth.  It felt the story was rushed and wasn't as well written as Hunger Games or Catching Fire.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game with relaxing music and sounds. The art is also very pretty with classic looking backgrounds. The gameplay is fun, makes you think without it being too difficult. Also found the &quot;playing with raindrops on a window&quot; concept adorable.
B00004CZN9|1.0|DVD does not work on DVD players in the US. I was disappointed that this was not advertised more clearly. I should of read the fine print.
B004LUS390|4.0|##update##<br />this app has been updated since my initial review and now works perfectly. the only sketchbook app I'll use.<br /><br />###<br /><br />this app became the only reason to carry my fire everywhere I went...until the app stopped working properly. still worth the 2$ but just not nearly the amazing it was. would have paid more the app was the best quality program ive seen on the market to date.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. I could not put the kindle down. I did not even realize i was on book two until my friend asked me to slowdown I was reading way to fast for her. I enjoyed each character except for Katniss. Although she is the heroine of the story, I felt like she was behaving as a today teenager who has to raise a sibling, and fend for the home any way he or she can. I understand many choices she had to make, such as saving her sister, protecting Peeta, and falling in love, which was based on survival, but i kind of felt like she is and was so selfish....\\"me, me, my, how I feel, when my father.\\" I did fall in love with Peeta. I like his selflessness. He kept giving at every step in the book, even when things looked bad for him. His love for Katniss was so overwhelming. It made me start thinking of the Snow White song, \\"I'm wishing, I'm wishing, for the one I love. I'm hoping, I'm hoping for the one I love. I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, of the one I love. To find me. To find me today. la-la-la, la-la-la.\\" I like President's Rose character, call me a devil's advocate, but I think it added suspense to the book. He was so cold and ruthless, it felt he was general. When you watch a war movie, and the lieutenant to the general tells him innocent people are going to die, and the general says \\"thats casualty of war.\\" Call it cliche but Rose's character shined more in the book than in the movie. I did not feel as scared or sickened by the movie character the way the book described. I think it made Katniss more realistic and human, she was able to share with her reader that she is and was afraid of him. However in the movie, I did not see it. Even at the end of the book where he is to be executed and instead of feeling rage and anger for him as she did throughout the last two books she felt empathy. I find that interesting. But again we come back to Katniss again the teenager of the story. I wonder if I was this aggressive and insensitive as a teenager when I was younger. Not only is she beautiful, and is now scarred but she is remarkable for all the challenges and future decisions she makes at a young age. I compell to the Ms. Collins, Create a story similar like the Star wars Trilogy, I feel like we could have an inbetween book. I didnt want the book to end. I did see the movie opening day in Massachusetts, and I thought Jennifer Lawrence really sold the character of Katniss. She made me look at Katniss from different angles that I would never consider. I fell inlove with the teenage character. I went back and reread the story, and was even more saddened because I knew the end.younger. Not only is she beautiful, and is now scarred but she is remarkable for all the challenges and future decisions she makes at a young age.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|I finished THG's and this series was suggested by several people that it would be a good follow up.  The book is good and it is a nice follow up.  It does have some similarities to THG's, but of course it is a different book.  It's not quite as good, it's a little slower paced, in my opinion.  I have started the second book \\"The Scorched Trials\\", so far it's actually a little better.  The pace and the story is starting to get better.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun to play for all ages we like it my girls ages nine and nineteen play. it even I enjoy it
0307200477|2.0|We received a copy of Pat the Bunny for a baby shower.  My daughter loved the first book, but it was a small paper-back, plastic-spiral-bound version.  When it was finally destroyed beyond repair, I started my search for a more durable copy.  I found this one and purchased it because it said it was a board book.  (To me, that meant it was a hard-cover with hard pages.)  I was very disappointed to open the book and find it was still the same paper pages and plastic spiral binding.  We've had it for 2 days, have read it twice and already had to put the entire group of pages back into the spiral binding.  Absolutely love this story and will continue to read it with my daughter and future child, but I sure wish someone would make a true board book version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In this final chapter of the Hunger Games, Katniss has been deceived by her own District 13 in the revolutionaries' attempts to overthrow the Capitol. At the same time, President Snow's hostile revenge towards Katniss, and the civil unrest she brought upon the Capitol, has Snow retaliating with horrifically devastating outcomes; one in particular that results in the absolute mind control of Peeta.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, it is truly an unbelievably gruesome turn of events. There are so many travesties in this concluding episode that your emotions never know where to go. There are extreme highs and lows, to be sure, for the many that die; despair among the characters; and horrific challenges. Taking everything into account, it was a bittersweet ending in the conquest of the Capitol towards the rebuilding of new leadership, and thus, a reformed civilization.<br /><br />The results in my journey as I completed the trilogy was total amazement...left me speechless. Not expecting such an outcome, all I can say is that the journey was well-taken. As a total geeky horror/sci-fi supporter, I would have killed them all off for the symbolism of the cause, but that wasn't the case in this ending: it had a quasi-fare happily-ever-after. (I suppose it was to appease the reader audience, kind of like Peeta and Katniss' undying love performance.) Nevertheless, it did leave lasting emotional scars to those characters that survived, which are also obvious in some of the brutal reviews I've read about the book. But to me, this was an absolutely fabulous finale! Brilliant writing by author Suzanne Collins! Highly Recommend!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game that also makes my son use his brains a bit. It will definitely be staying on my phone.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I like the fact that when you are ready to put the stroller in the car, the cup holder isn't in the way.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm a fairly big Trek fan and I had my doubts about this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the story and I feel young Spock and Bones were captured perfectly. What I didn't like about this movie was the obvious desire to seperate this movie from about 50 years of cinema and TV history. JJ Abrams beat us over the head in telling us that he's rebooting the franchise that it became exhausting. We get it! You're trying to bring in new fans! Just don't disappoint too many of the old fans in the process, which is what happened. It's an exciting and even funny movie but I'm not sure if the die-hard fans will enjoy it as much. Howver, if I can be swayed so can those who are bigger fans than I.
0553573403|3.0|I just noticed these as I started to read the book and it had me wondering: Is there any chance this guy is a Grateful Dead fan?
B005K17RU0|5.0|so far so good. I never a problem with the app crashing my kindle fire. the interface is excellent: very clean, sharp, and easy to use.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|wish it was easier to add friends, and it takes a long time to earn energy...having trouble with gamelofts server :( otherwise, a fun game.
0060555661|5.0|I highly readable book. If you've ever thought of buying a stock you should read this book.<br /><br />At least chapters 8 and 20, including Berskshire's annual shareholder letters.
B0055SWM08|5.0|its relaxing and challenging.<br />and on top of that i got it free.<br />the music is very good too.<br />i highly recommend it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I too want to throw my 2c in about loving this app. Fun mental shut down w little puzzles. Much nicer than slingshoting birds at pigs.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the prettiest brain teasers I've ever seen. Love this game! I got it free, but it would have been well worth paying full price for.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I really enjoyed season two of in treatment. I plan to order season three. I enjoy the acting and the revelations are true to life.
0439023521|5.0|Honestly, I'm not even going to go into detail about the book. I heard about the movie and I knew it was pretty popular but I never really cared. I went into a Barnes and Noble one day to get something for school. When they didn't have the item I needed I ended up wandering around just looking. Honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of books or reading. I don't know why but I spontaneously chose to purchase this book after crossing the big stand/display they had for it; perhaps I just did not want to go home empty handed. After I got home, I put the book on my drawer and left it there, in the bag, for weeks. Just three days ago I decided to pick the book up and, since I am not a huge fan of reading, my reading pace was quite slow. In nearly every free minute I have had (on the train, on the bus, before sleep, before leaving for school, in between class) I have turned to this book to fulfill an addiction. I've just finished reading it less than 20 minutes ago and decided to do this review, as my first review on this website, simply because of the awe I was put in by this book. Just buy it, trust me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is so much fun!! Different levels and its very additive! I got this app not to long ago and its hard for me to put it down! A must get app!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic free game! Thanks for making it and sharing it with us! Beautiful and well made, challenging too! thank you! thank you! Warning, Danger Will Robinson!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is an awesome spin off from the original Oregon trail, and I LOVE IT. I recommend giving this a try. You won't be disappointed.  That is for sure ^_^
B004SOR4H6|5.0|this wasn't working on my kindle when I first updated it. all you have to do is delete the old twitter app that was actually just a shortcut to a mobile webpage. then the new update for the twitter app will work just fine.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its kinda fun but there are some hard games that I cant beat but overall its a pretty fun game
B0073XORCY|5.0|I saw Jethro Tull perform the original \\"Thick As A Brick\\" -- the whole, entire album -- live in Maine years ago when I was in college, probably very soon after the album was released.  The performance was amazing.  I have seen the band several times since.  I bought \\"Thick As A Brick 2\\" and began listening with a measure of trepidation.  I was immediately won over.  Ian took just enough of the old musical hooks to give a nod to the original.  Then he expanded upon -- and improved upon -- those musical themes. I have listened to the new CD continuously since I purchased it.  Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull not only created a solid follow up to the original.  In my view, they have created a real masterpiece. The musicianship is tight.  The songs are catchy, especially those about the banker and military man.  The ending?  I love it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a really fun game even though its like Mario just in a simplified version practically, but still I love playing this game
B00632HWOG|1.0|Putting in ads is hardly an update especially if it really is going to slow down the app and lose screen space.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very nice fun game j had a lot of fun playing this game. you should really try it. it is simple to play anyone can do it
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I got this for my Kindle when it first came out. It's definitely a worthy addition to the Angry Birds family of games. The \\"space physics\\" of gravity and inertia are integrated quite well, and the new abilities of the birds were quite fun.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it was over much too quickly. I was able to get three stars on all the levels -- plus all the golden asteroids -- in just a few days, playing it only at night before going to bed.<br /><br />Still, when you think about it, $3 for a few days of fun is not a bad deal at all. And it looks like there may be more levels coming in the future.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like Angry Birds on your Kindle, you're likely to enjoy this one too.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, now that more episodes have been released, this one's got plenty of length to it. Very fun stuff.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  it is extremely. addicting.  definitely. recommend this to any one enjoys the &quot;story&quot; type of games.
0571202284|5.0|Most people have learned the adage, \\"Learn the rules, then you can break them\\" but when it comes to art, what are the rules? And when it comes to commercial art with subjective tastes and evolving styles, again I ask, what are the rules?<br /><br />This book begins, logically, with the history of animation. If you don't know how we got to where we are today it's really easy to find yourself reinventing the wheel, and Richard Williams is big on avoiding reinventing wheels. He supports efficiency and economy of effort but wisely points out that sometimes the only shortcut is simply elbow grease. Software sellers rarely suggest this is necessary. It may seem to some that he's starting slow and waxing poetic about days long gone but he's actually helping animators consider a change audiences don't seem to catch.<br /><br />Pure animation, and we're not talking story here, is a visual medium that is expressed through drawing. Drawing can take many forms but the real jumping off point is drawing from what we know. What do we know? We know the physical world around us. A new animator might argue that we aren't photographers and that we aren't trying to replicate what we see. William's argues that until we understand what we see and can express that perfectly we will never be able to pull off into more imaginative work convincingly because our skill level is lacking. This point is repeated throughout the book for a reason: it's sensible. We may have computers to create the in-betweens, but if we don't know how an inbetween should behave we really don't know what to ask of our assistants, be they computers or hired hands. Williams is an interesting study regarding this because he began his career as many amateur animators might. He jumped in head first with complete disdain for the 'old school' animation and got lucky enough to build a career from it. This worked well for awhile until he really had to grow and realized the 'old school' was a very disciplined bunch, whose talents could rival or subjugate the best of today. Seeing that the men of the old school (mainly Disney talent) were fading away he hired a few to work for him and, in turn, soak up everything they have to offer. And here it is.<br /><br />We get lessons on masses, perspective, movement, timing, spacing, production methods, walks, runs, jumps, flexibility, weight, anticipation, takes, accents, wave/whip action,  dialogue, physical expression, animal action, camera movement, character blocking and directing. Lots of pages, lots of drawings, plenty of straight forward examples.<br /><br />There is no other animation book that covers so much, so thoroughly, so clearly in such a logical, helpful sequence. This is definitely a book all animator's must have.<br /><br />of course there are some who will pick this up and think, 'All I want to do is South Park type stuff'. William's addresses that attitude in a poem he posted for all his workers to see as he headed 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'.<br /><br />\\"Epitaph of an Unfortunate Artist\\"<br />He found a formula<br />for drawing<br />comic rabbits.<br />This formula for<br />drawing comic<br />rabbits paid.<br />So in the end he<br />could not<br />change the<br />tragic habits<br />This formula for<br />drawing comic rabbits made.<br /><br />If you're trying to build an animation career I can't think of a better book to start with.
B003L20ICE|5.0|Literally  no words. I honestly forgot if I bought it used or new, but it doesn't matter because it looked like new. It was spotless, wrapped up, and the disc has NO scratches on it. I'm very pleased.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app it is so fun and addicting I can not stilop playing it. I have all the other Texan lava games they are also really fun and addicting
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game. it works great on  my kindle . I think it runs out of energy quickly though otherwise thumbs up.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|You have to buy cash or you can only go so far. Other wise its pretty addictive and very similar to the farm games elsewhere .
B002UXRGLG|5.0|The BBC makes the best nature films. This one is beyond words, total immersion in the natural world. And each time one shows ends you wish it was much longer. I really enjoyed this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game I love!!! you get to create your own town. Your town gets to represent you by how you create it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addicting and calming. The gameplay is simple yet provides a challenge. I love it, can't keep my hands off of it. My girlfriend loves it too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This a really nice casual game for a tablet. Simple controls, elegant design and it provides a little challenge as well.
B007LEC7CC|5.0|Love the album and can't wait to see her Live in the fall of 2012!  Glad I bought the Deluxe Version to get all the songs.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought this book after trying many others, and let me tell you this is by far the best! He is to the point and has common sense answers to many bodybuilding questions. Highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn how to get started on body building and anyone who wants to expand their knowledge.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I just bought the paperback for $6.  Why is it $10 on Amazon.  I would much rather read it on my iPad but it's not worth the difference in price to do that.  I haven't read it yet but gave it five stars because I love Lee Child and haven't read a bad Reacher novel yet.  I've read them all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game.  Nice visuals. It really is a perfect game to just sit and relax or unwind.  Casual gameplay can be taken to a level that is fun and at the same time it holds on to a quality that is uniquely artistict.  The music is chill and suits the game well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Simple fast fun.  Energy drops fast but still good enough.  not too pushy about spending idle money either.<br />  have fun.
B000TETF9O|5.0|If you haven't heard this album, get it.  If, like me, you forgot how much you love this album, and your original vinyl is long gone, get it again.  This amazed me in college in 1975.  I couldn't get enough of it.  This, plus early Genesis, was the soundtrack of those wonderful years.  Baby's on Fire, with Robert Fripp is over the top fantastic.  Brian Eno's creativity lives on.  It's still new 40 minus one year later.  I keep dried roses on my mantel in homage.  I just read that Eno communicated his musical vision to the musicians by dancing for them.  No wonder it's so incredible.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really wanted to play Frontierville on my kindle fire but I cant this is a great replacement so far so good
B007PTJOV0|5.0|nice to have game like Angry Birds that's just fun to play without having to keep spending real money and/or time to enjoy. (like Paradise Island, Bakery Story, Pet Salon, bla bla bla.) It is Mario concept but who cares. Mario was fun. So is this and its FREE
B0055SWM08|5.0|love this game!!!!! It is so fun and relaxing to play. Also has awesome graphics. would recommend to everyone looking for fun.
051755075X|5.0|The hard cover has a better life span, but the soft cover has a better image. My used book was in great condition and has great content. From other reviews i saw that it is a bit redundant from other books of Ogilvy. Only one Ogilvy though so any of his books focued on advertising and not a narrative on his life is great.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|This is a very good toy even though it seems ultra simple.  It is loved by the little ones and I think it is sooo cute!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I'm an artsy, crafty person, have been for my whole life, and this was one thing I hadn't tried, though I do cut my own mosaic tiles out of stained glass, so I'm well acquainted with scoring glass. I watched the video on YouTube in order to put it together (not one of my skills), heated my water and set up another pot of cold water, excited to get started. I also watched the YouTube demo of how to use the cutter, looked so easy.<br /><br />I had saved a bunch of Perrier bottles to learn on. First bottle, didn't come apart at all. I figured it was inconsistent pressure and worked on that the second time around, but no matter how consistent, gentle, hard or whatever pressure, the succeeding bottles (half a dozen of them) broke open with shards and lines running hither and yon....not what I'd envisioned. One decided to detach as I carried it to the trash can, and I spent 15 minutes making sure I swept up all the glass shards so my Shih Tzu wouldn't eat them. By this time, I'm thinking \\"I Love Lucy\\".<br /><br />I have average strength for an adult woman, and I kept thinking I can do this, but the whole thing is poorly designed, and when I hold on with my left hand as indicated in the video, it hurts my hand. The strip that's supposed to hold the cutter steady invariably slips open, no matter how tightly I screw down the wing-nut. I would pay more for a bottle cutter that's well designed, dependable and doesn't cause me pain.<br /><br />I thought about sending it back, but I've already paid $5 in postage, and will pay another $5 to return it, so I'll keep it and try on various kinds of bottles. If anything works, I'll update my review. As of now, it's a definite thumbs down on the Generation Green (g2) Bottle Cutter.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|resterant story is a fun game. but some of the items that you can nuy are priced really high.  i still like it alot
B00000IMTE|5.0|so, they collide...the guitar master from the legendary heavy rock band DEEP PURPLE, and RONNIE JAMES DIO...The two together create the classic progressive heavy metal band RAINBOW, and this debut is simply brilliant...the hit MAN ON THE SILVER MOUNTAIN, CATCH THE RAINBOW and SNAKECHARMER are pearls!!! All the songs rocks completelly!!Great album, as all the RAINBOW albuns with DIO...If you like Iron Maiden, take a look on Rainbow and see where they got inspiration!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have a lot on my plate everyday, family of 6 full time mom as well as full time job. At the end of my day I love being able to wind my mind down with these puzzles and calm my mind and body with the soothing music. wish there were more games out there like this one.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Oh, noo...This is the last album from RAINBOW with DIO!!!..Fortunatelly, Dio leaves Rainbow to go to BLACK SABBATH to create 2 metal masterpieces....and than go solo to record HOLY DIVER and LAST IN LINE...Well, maybe actually was good to DIO to fly away and create music in other places...Anyway, RAINBOW´s debut, RISING and this one LONG LIVE ROCK N´ROLL are the best heavy rock you can get!!! RIP DIO...
B0055SWM08|5.0|Intuitive game play. Soothing music. Great app! The levels can exercise  the mind well. Nice design. I like the music the best!
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun to play and a challenging . fun to kill time with<br />didn't mess up my phone or lock up . get it you will love it
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a very fun and oddly addicting game! I recommend it to everyone who loves playing games of strategy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love the original Oregon trail for kindle fire so I had to try this of course. This is a lot nicer and easier than most other arcade/casual apps. Has a nice flow.
B004UXUX7S|2.0|Clooney is much better at being the \\"cute clown\\" so loved by so many of his loyal female admirers.  It's when he veers off course into the arena of serious drama that he seems a little out of his area of competence.  In 5 months the movie has made about $83M in the States, and $171M worldwide, so it's been a success, if that sort of thing impresses us, really.... As the \\"cute clown\\", Clooney is entertaining, but when served up with a side-order of slice-of-life human angst, Clooney is kind of boring to many of us who also have a Y-chromosome.<br /><br />Anytime Clooney wants to make a pile of money, all he has to do is shave, get dressed up, and appear in another \\"Ocean's\\"-style movie. The women will follow him in hordes... at the theater, and on election day, where this well-known liberal Democrat serves as one of Obama's \\"high priests\\".<br /><br />OK, next!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I think the graphics are great the puzzles are challenging I'm not sure what the years mean so ghats a little odd but all in all I ting it to be a good game
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Horrible controls. not fun at all!! dont get it and waste your time!!! -i dont like it at all. trust me
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it was quirky but easy to read and I loved all the characters and the story line. Several parts of the book really effected me and I laughed and cried.  Well worth the read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|easy to play, relaxing yet challenging. good hook for the second game in the series. works well on galaxy nexus.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|it's time consuming and addictive!  only thing is Internet is always needed. I would definitely recommend this game to any age group.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is exciting and challenging,  make you use your mind and problem solving skills.  Have been through several levels and have enjoyed them all.  Will be taking it with me to all my appointments.  Not boring at all.  Love it!!

B003Y5HWMW|1.0|Let me start off by saying that I hadn't seen this show until I purchased it on Blu-ray based on consumer reviews.  One star might be a bit harsh, but I have to counterbalance all of the ridiculously high 5-star ratings this show has received.  Seriously, there's nothing amazing about it.  Sure, the scale of it is grand, but the pace moves like a snail throughout most of it.  In fact, the first 4-5 episodes are a total bore.  There are endless conversations that serve no purpose, as well as many controversial elements that seem to exist for no other reason than shock value or titilation: full-frontal nudity, incest, gay sex, lesbian sex, even kids killing kids.  And the graphic, gorey deaths are not limited to just humans: there are plenty of animals slaughtered in bloody detail.  I'm not offended by any of it, although I could do without the onscreen violence toward animals.  I didn't mind similar elements in HBO's series \\"Rome\\" because they seemed to support the story more or could be supported by history.  In GOT, however, most of them felt gratuitous as if HBO said to the creative team, \\"Hey, we're HBO so we have to have these things, so find a way to throw them in.\\"<br /><br />After 10 episodes, I don't feel anything for any of the characters.  I couldn't care less who sits on the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, and that's the real problem with the show.  If I cared about the characters, I'd be interested in the events of future seasons, but since watching this season was a chore I have no interest in putting more $$$ in HBO's pocket.
0439023483|5.0|My daughter was asking for this book in a big retail store at full retail price.I told her I would get it for her some other time and went home,got on Amazon,ordered it and paid half of what the store wanted.With Prime I paid no shipping and had it in 2 days.<br />I know nothing about the book itself but I believe my daughter is enjoying it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|enjoyed playing it. the only down side is when they ask for a 5 star review. however it is a decent app that the whole family can enjoy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Challenging game. Real brain teaser. Worth the price and then some. Fun way to pass time. I now play this more than my daily crossword.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very interesting game play! addictive! definitely so happy that this was free app of the day! been wanting this game!
B0053JJLLC|1.0|This book had poor reviews before I bought it. However, the main subject sounded interesting and the authors were well-known to me.The best part of the book was the sample from Kindle.I paid the same price for the Kindle version as what the hard copy cost at Walmart. Bottom line shame on me for disregarding reviews.Don't buy this book.Slow and ponderous.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This has cooled my cpu(i5 2400) temps down 40+ degrees C, and has drastically increased gaming performance, because the cpu no longer has to throttle itself while under heavy load (previously was using the stock fan). Now, even during gaming, it scarcely rises above the mid 30's C, and my framerates have gone up across the board. On a sheer performance-per-dollar basis, this is one of the best investments I have made towards my modest rig. Cooler Master, despite its cheesy name, continues to impress me with build quality and reliability.<br /><br />I would say this heat sink (+ fan) is a MUST HAVE.<br /><br />Note: Installation was a tad difficult because there didn't seem to be a setting on the retention module that was an obvious perfect fit; but let's face it - if you're buying this, half the reason you're doing it is for the satisfaction of improving your rig, and a little elbow grease might give you more of a sense of accomplishment. =) I'd recommend watching some youtube tutorial instead of looking at the instructions. Also, the fan is a little bit loud at full speed, so make sure you use some software like speedfan to only run it as fast as you need to.
B003KTMW9K|5.0|It's a pretty entertaining game, after several hours the only problem is the beginning of... There's a kind of inattention in this prologue for those who doesn't read the books yet and doesn't know the world of Geralt...
B004JN1D2I|2.0|When I started the series I said cool a dark fantasy story with elements of real life tragedy. Then I said man this author is brutal but paints a good story. Then I read about flags....... Cheap trash complete waste of time. If you think this authors writings are any good past the first two books your only supporting him dragging out the story without cause or purpose. Wake up and stop reading this overhyped overpriced drivel. He completely ruined his own story the five star crowd must be paid shills. Going to go and find some self published gem out there somewhere, I am about to completely swear off any of the large publishers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smooth graphics and challenging game play make Quell a must have.  Level of difficulty increases at just the right pace, keeps you interested not frustrated.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this with my two sons and we have a lot of fun.  the games are pretty easy and don't frustrate them like other games tend to do.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a very fun game that seems like you actually are raising your own town.I recomemd this game to anyone.very addicting
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game lots of fun. takes too long to gain back energy though. but overall fun game and great fun.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's been a while since I got this record and I have to say .... it's perfection!<br /><br />There are albums that come along like Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rummors\\" that every cut is just fantastic.<br /><br />This record is that.  I love it.  I play it all the time.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Use to be a good little app but now they have included ads I am removing the ap and moving to gmail.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like playing Quell, it makes me think logically. I have not had any problems with loading or anything. Optimus V
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a lot like frontierville on facebook. wish you didn't need actual cash for some things though. otherwise a good time waster.  :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is wonderful when you're incredibly bored but its really addictive! you go around completing  tasks while expanding your little settlement.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|An outstanding read that will grab hold of you and won't let you go.  I'm dying here waiting to find out what happens to Kvothe after University and how he gets to the inn.
0545265355|4.0|I bought these books for my now, wife. She hasn't read them all yet.<br />I bought the hard-back set and the quality was pretty good.<br />The shipping was pretty quick as well.<br />Over all, I was pleased with my purchase.
B0055SWM08|3.0|its an ok game. frustrating that when you try to make certain moves it won't let you. then when you asked for a hint it makes the same moves you were trying to make. that makes no sense.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|No collection is post-World War II music is complete without Abbey Road.  This is not only the greatest single Beatle album, but it is one of the greatest rock records of all time.  It never grows stale, and always sounds great.  This remastered version is a must for rock lovers.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This CD is a wonderful collection of Whitney's best hits and I'm so pleased with it.The price was great (much cheaper than E-bay!!) and it contains my favorite Whitney songs all in one CD. I'd highly recommend this CD for any Whitney Houston fan! She will be missed terribly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some of these games are hard!!!! Fun to play while stuck on the metro though. Going to need help getting past some of these GAMES!!!
B000002VSN|5.0|This CD is even better than I remembered from years ago. It's always playing in my van now and even my children sing along! The lyrics are uplifting and the songs really show off Whitney's fabulous voice. I miss her.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I am A Bruce Springsteen fan from way back. That being said, it took more than a couple of listens for this material to grow on me. This is Bruce in a more introspective mood. I have come to appreciate this CD but it was not an instant \\"O, I luv It\\". Once u reach a certain age-life is too short to waste on bad music or wine. This music deserves a chance to grow on u as it did me. I'm glad I gave it a chance.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It arrived in the condition it was listed in and plays without any problems.
0345803485|1.0|Feminism takes a GIANT step backward, and apparently, the English language does as well.  This is NOT a love story.  This is NOT the story of a healthy sexual awakening.  This is NOT a reflection of empowered female sexuality.  This is NOT even that erotic.  Apparently, the only way for a woman to be sexually adventurous is at the hands of a simple-minded creep in a rape fantasy. If you want read real erotica, read something that is written by someone who actually knows more synonyms for a vagina than \\"down there\\" and \\"sex\\", and \\"length\\" for penis.  Seriously, the most terrible book I have ever read.  It deserves no stars what-so-ever, Amazon - this should be an option.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After finishing the first book - had to read the second ASAP!  Went through it fast.  Engaging and a good read.  I am on the third book now and anticipating how the trilogy may end.<br />I recommend the three books highly!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not what I expected!!!  Really enjoying this game!! still not able to connect with facebook friends though maybe just not doing something right lol

B000AP04L0|5.0|This is a funny movie if you ever worked in the business environment and had a cube.  You will be able to relate to this movie and the typical office equipment not working right, annoying co-workers and your boss.  The crazy tactics used to get you to work overtime, we been there done it and now there is a movie on this subject.
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|I bought this because I like the look of its features, especially the adjustable mounting plate and the fact it supports up to 5 lbs. The stabilizer is well made, only the handle is made of plastic with a plastic foam cover. That could be improved. The adjustable mounting plate is a great feature for balancing the unit. the spirit level is a great for helping achieve true balance. I do have problems with it going out of balance while in use and I'm not sure what is causing that. The counterbalance has some play at the adjustment knob, but I believe I can tighten that which may help. I wish Opteka would publish a better manual (like the Merlin's manual which is a good source for using any camera stabilizer). Overall, I'm satisfied with the product and the price I paid for it.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|When I first read the \\"Hunger Games\\", I was intrigued. I had a few issues with the writing style, narration, and other literary shortcomings but it held my interest and was very captivating.<br /><br />In my opinion \\"Catching Fire\\" was probably the high point of the series. The twists and cliffhangers were well-played and the new characters (especially Finnick) were a welcome addition to the story.<br /><br />However, \\"Mockingjay\\" takes everything you love about the story, piles it up, and burns it to ashes. Every character you liked either gets decapitated, annihilated, mutilated, psychologically damaged, morally corrupted, or embittered. The characters that do survive, including Katniss, become unlikable. I've had my fair share of violent movies, games, and novels, but this one was pretty distasteful.<br /><br />The ending was the MOST DEPRESSING I've ever read to any novel. Yeah, I get it. War is bad, it hurts and mutilates people blah blah. But it was like SC was trying too hard to avoid a cliche ending, avoiding both the \\"happy ending\\" or the \\"heroic tragedy\\". Instead, she puts the character in eternal unresolved torment for the rest of her pathetic sad life. I'm a guy so I didn't bawl like a girl but I had a hard time sleeping. The impact of the book and the dark cloud it put on me was hard to shake off.<br /><br />It is such a shame. This could have earned the trilogy epic status, but instead dove right into mediocrity.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|like it but it needs a lot more levels it is a very good game but I think until they make an update they they should lower the price. I think if I were you I would hold off for a while.
1439170916|1.0|The book is really terrible. it uses a very old and difficult English and it keep flying between stories without finishing any story you get lost, confused and finally you feel headache
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|if it was more like the original. game fine but its not. NO LEARNING PHASE some of the icons you don't know what they do (ie) the sheriff star? ?? wtf is that for ......??? you get lost and confused. wish someone would fix the real ORIGINAL. game for a app.nthen they would have something. only good thing is you font waste $$$$ BUT THE TIME you use finding out that its not worth the freenpart. ALL HALE THE ORIGINAL GAME BTING THAT TO US. then it would be fun.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|this hes got to be the shortest game for $1.99 graphics are good and it id interesting but way too short for a paid app.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|great game with plenty to to. graphics and found are good only drawback is you use energy really quick and have to wait or buy more. that should be changed if it was would have given 5 stars

B004T2QZL8|5.0|the best game ever. very fun and creative!!!!!!!!!!it looks lame at first ;but it is realy fun wen  u play it.
0345803485|4.0|I agree with others that some of the writing in this first book is rough, but it gets much better in book #2, and so does the story. This first book was VERY dark, but I found it fascinating, all the same. People have many facets. I thought the author did a credible job of creating very flawed, yet very real characters. And she explored a lifestyle that may not be to your liking but is definitely out there and definitely has its enthusiasts.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think the book successfully asked \\"Do we really know ourselves, and if we do, are we brave enough to admit who we are and what makes us tick?\\" Anastasia had her eyes opened not only to this impossibly damaged, complicated man; she was given a wake-up call to desires she never comprehended possessing.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey (fabulous title!) is an addictive read, which I consider the best kind.  I highly recommend this novel for those looking for something in the romance genre that's completely out of left field.  It's twisted, but oh so refreshing in today's market or repetitious plots.<br /><br />Half way through the second book and looking forward to the third.  And will be quite curious to see how they get the movie into theaters without an NC-17 rating!
B006R1T40I|5.0|There must be something in the water.  How else to explain how Tom Waits, Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor and now Bonnie Raitt are turning in such brilliant work so deep into their long and illustrious careers?  To me, Slipstream is a distillation of everything that Bonnie masters so well, both on the up-tempo numbers and on the slow burners.<br /><br />And as a long-time fan of both Joe Henry and Loudon Wainwright III, I'm prepared to stand on their coffee tables in my cowboy boots and say that Bonnie's version of Joe and Loudon's \\"You Can't Fail Me Now\\" is the definitive one.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book was fantastic! When I bought this, I'd just finished a different series that I absolutely loved, and was having a hard time finding something I enjoyed as much. By the second chapter, I was hooked. I kept telling myself I had to go to sleep and I'd finish it the next day but I couldn't bring myself to put it down. The main characters are fantastic, the romance is sweet, and the suspense is strong enough to keep you wanting more. I can't wait for more from this Author and hope this turns in to a series.

B00079HZUM|4.0|I watched Stage Beauty on The Movie Channel tonight and it was truly an incredible piece of acting.  Claire Danes and Billy Crudup were magnificent but the true star was Rupert Everett as King Charles II.  Everett is without a doubt the most incredible actor to ever portray Charles II.  If they ever made a documentary on Charles II anytime in the future, they should again seek out the acting abilities of Everett.  Not only does he look exactly like Charles II, his manners, style of walk, and an overall ability to impart a sense that he really is Charles II is absolutely incredible.  Anyone that likes a good love story will like this movie.  Anyone who likes any type of period drama, will love this.  Anyone who is interested in Charles II, may enjoy this movie.  Anyone who is interested in the 17th century monarchy and aristocracy may enjoy this movie.  Overall, it is a good movie and enjoyable to watch.  The movie rarely has any down time or real slow parts other than a few spots in the beginning but they are not bad at all, and they are very watchable, just not fast paced.  In fact, the entire movie is not fast paced either now that I think about it, but it is WATCHABLE to be sure.  I do think that any aspiring actor or actress should be mandated to watch this movie.  It also should be standard for teachers/professors to show this in college or high school level acting classes.  Not only does it introduce the student to what acting is like, it also gives them an idea what being an actor or actress would have been like in the 17th century, persecuting women as actresses (which was forbidden at that time) but seeing how Charles II (his mistress begging) insisted by issuing a Royal degree that women women would from that time forward be allowed to play women in stage productions in England.  This was an incredible milestone at that time in history and due to Charles II being returned to the throne after his exile, he was feeling more generous and wanted to do the will of the people, rather than the will of his ministers who were totally against his decision.  Charles II was very worried at the time of the restoration of what the people thought and wanted and he did everything in his effort to appease the people.  Charles II was keenly aware that his own father had been executed years before and he didn't want anything to jeopardize his own reign or secure the future of his descendants.  For any aspiring student of theater, you will be pleased with this movie.  For everyone else, I think most would enjoy this love story.  Enjoy all........of the people, rather than the will of his ministers who were totally against his decision.

B002WY65VU|5.0|Yes, I'm a fan of Jesse Eisenberg...but that aside, this is a very entertaining movie.  I'm not a fan of a lot of gore. But if it's mixed with comedy I don't mind so much (Shaun of the Dead is an example).<br /> This movie is one of those you won't watch just once and put on a shelf. I have seen it several times and it just keeps getting better. Maybe because I might have missed some things earlier.<br /> I think a good test of a movie is when you have a few people together talking about it and they quote some things from it...as the \\"rules\\".<br /> I saw it mentioned somewhere by movie critics that Jesse Eisenberg is \\"underused\\" in the industry.  I agree.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones is based on George R R Martin books, and it's very well adapted. Will please readers as well as those new to this universe. One of he best things about GoT is that it is actually realistic, avoiding common cliches, such as the good guys never die or never lose, the bad guy is very evil and wants to take over the world, etc. Most characters are not good or bad, just real people, driven by love, greed, ambition, money and other human emotions, so you will probably feel sympathy for most of them.<br /><br />Besides from the wonderfully written characters, he plot twists and reveals are also a highlight, and are sure to keep you entertained. It is easier to follow than the books, so even the lazy watchers will probably like it.<br /><br />Most of the viewers that dislike the series seem to have a problem with the nudity, and sometimes with the explicit violence, but it is coherent with the books, and add reality to the scenes. None of them are pure meaningless violence or sex, all the scenes have a meaning, so...

B007BT0RKG|5.0|Pros:<br />It is literally maps on the go<br />No need for any connection (cell, wifi) or even GPS (since my device doesn't have GPS)<br />GPS tracking is available with GPS enabled devices<br />Easy to zoom in and out<br />Easy to see and identify road names<br />User added content means new roads and areas are included more often than dedicated GPS units with built in static maps, or pay to upgrade map systems<br /><br />cons:<br />not much detail for the downloaded (offline) maps, just basic roads,<br />no elevation or idea of trees, fields, buildings for reference<br />no waypoint or suggested routing for offline non-GPS devices<br />need to download multiple states for traveling across state lines<br />for budget devices (like mine) it tends to slow down the device when minimized, so you need to force close it when you are done, luckily app startup is very quick

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I ended up getting this edition after getting Wool for free ... and liking it enough to buy the entire series.. I reviewed each one as I finished, but I must say that this really is the best deal for the money.<br /><br />For Wool:<br /><br />This was good.<br /><br />Short, sweet, and to the point. It peeked my curiosity and as well grasped my emotions - a perfect mix for a short story. It only took me a few minutes to read it, but was awesome the entire time.<br /><br />It is sci-fi and plays with the human need for hope. I really would not like to go into much about what the book deals with, because it may ruin something for the possible reader. Just know that this has a great storyline and will really turn your head/ideas around.<br /><br />As an afterthought.. it felt very much like a Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode.<br /><br />For Wool 2:<br /><br />I liked this one very much... Not really as much as the first but with the way the first introduced this world... I was certain you could not follow it up better.<br /><br />In this one you get a better idea of how the silo works and a more well rounded list of characters... Or maybe not... Maybe close to the same, but you can tell by the end that is is not really meant to stand on its own, but instead to grab a reader for the wanting of the next book.<br /><br />I have to say that I really enjoy the writing style and like that each moment I am ready to guess the next more about the world, but also have so many questions that I want answered as well...<br /><br />Something near the end has given me other ideas for a blog post and I am excited bout writing that.. Though I recommend having read this before that post. I will link to it when it is written and posted!<br /><br />Language Factor : In reading it I remember one or two 'bad' words.. so .. know that .. but mainly the language is fine.<br /><br />For Wool 3:<br /><br />HOLY SMOKES!!<br /><br />This is GOOD STUFF!!<br /><br />I have to be honest.. This book was about to be a four star review.. I liked the second book and was glad for a continuation, but was really lost on where one could go from what the first one created.  I was even getting a little bored near the middle of reading this one.  But.. all changed shortly after that.. This one has sealed the plot.. has.. created such an awesome story.  Maybe not something that was not a little predictable, but with such simple telling of the stories.. it was .. unexpected.<br /><br />I am on to the next one!<br /><br />For Wool 4:<br /><br />We are now to the point where the story is just broken into pieces. It has been this way for the full five books but the end of three and in four it is even more apparent.<br /><br />Once you have read the third, you are invested enough to read them all.. I am excited about reading the next one, the progression of story has been wonderful!<br /><br />This particular one has had the most cursing... And I would not be surprised if the last one has even more (I was very wrong about this).<br /><br />Still a great scifi read... If you have ever read The Lottery (likely for school) or maybe Harrison Bergeron.. And enjoyed them a tiny bit.. You will certainly enjoy wool.<br /><br />For Wool 5:<br /><br />Coming off of the awesomeness of all the previous .. this one could only be good... and it was.  I enjoyed every bit of it.  I am amazed at how well he tells a story.  True.. I would have liked some other parts in there, but I can understand why they were 'left out' or truncated to a later 'explaination' stage.<br /><br />The 'conclusion' of this series was wonderful.  I still was surprised by the end.  I know what I wanted and I have some pretty interesting ideas about the future of this world.  I like what these stories sparked in my mind and would recommend them to pretty much anyone!ook was about to be a four star review..

I am amazed at how well he tells a story.  True.. I would have liked some other parts in there, but I can understand why they were 'left out' or truncated to a later 'explaination' stage.<br /><br />The 'conclusion' of this series was wonderful.  I still was surprised by the end.  I know what I wanted and I have some pretty interesting ideas about the future of this world.  I like what these stories sparked in my mind and would recommend them to pretty much anyone!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I tried a few of these card games and this is the best basic solitare app around. Has a few options to customize your game. If you like Solitare, this should work great.<br /><br />Only down side is if it sees you have an internet connection, it will automatically display advertisements between games, and sometimes it is video ads (which can use cell phone data usage).
B00756GKBA|2.0|I was not in love with this CD. I'm a fan of Madonna and have been, but one day when I was taking a long drive  and I decided to listen to her new album. I was so disappointed I was fighting myself to find good qualities about every song. I'm use to Madonna having a message, being political, being inspired, innovative with catchy lyrics, and with type of meaningful lyrics to every song (not always all at once). All of what I loved about Madonna escaped her in this album. It lacked so much. It seemed as though she was just trying to be poppy and young sounding when in reality she should just write music the way she always has, with meaning behind a song.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This really makes you think. I like that! You gotta stay on your toes mentally. I think everybody should have this game.
B0063GORYU|3.0|love the challenge of the game but HATE the constant ad pop ups. would consider buying version to get rid of ads or possibly deleting game all together.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great app for Kindle Fire. hope there are more levels to come. want more games from this developer.  five stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very good game to stretch the mind, but not at the expense of the nerves. The shooting background music is the key to Quell!

B003MC5N28|4.0|Before there was The Hunger Games, or the world of new Young Adult genre selections we often see today with beautiful and appealing covers that enthralls our imagination and tends to our emotions, there was The Giver. It has been a book of its own caliber. One that tends to the human spirit and intellect with a sophisticated approach to society and the individual. If you read this book in childhood, it will stay with you for the rest of your life. If you read this book in adulthood, it will blow your whole view of life wide open.<br /><br />As one of the Newbery Medal Award winners for the most oustanding contribution to children's literature, the author deserves some mention. Lois Lowry is absolutely one of those writers of simple genius, a seemingly effortless genius. This is what she says about the book (from Random House Website).<br /><br />\\"I will say that the whole concept of memory is one that interests me a great deal. I'm not sure why that is, but I've always been fascinated by the thought of what memory is and what it does and how it works and what we learn from it. And so I think probably that interest of my own and that particular subject was the origin, one of many, of The Giver.\\"<br /><br />A seemingly utopian society for the purpose of the greater good. Every year is significantly structured to promote the appropriate and standardized growth of each child. At the age of twelve, all children are given their 'adult' places/careers/duties in society. They are taught that questioning and having existential wonderings are 'stirrings,' and should be treated by the use of pills. Their lives are built around the concept of conformation. Conform or be 'appealed.' Mostly everything becomes an automatic and possibly even meaningless gesture.<br /><br />This book is about Jonas's journey through this society. All events in the book matter, and every page is significant to the transformation of the story. At twelve, Jonas is chosen with the responsibility of being the new Receiver of Memory. How does one bear the burden of memory of the whole human experience? The agony of war. Disease. Loss and pain. Even the heights of human existence: human acheivement, freedom, music, color, and the power of love. He, alone, keeps these memories on behalf of his community. He isn't to share them with a single person. The reason being that no-one, supposedly, wants to experience the whole range of human emotion. Additionally, this limitation on the society as a whole means that if people cannot remember things then they cannot remember the pain that comes with life as well, holding people in ignorant bliss.<br /><br />The ending felt much like being vaguely abandoned. There is a sense of ambiguity about the ending when you get to it. The Giver is the first in the series of three book, the second being Gathering Blue and the third being The Messenger. Just with any series, the placement of such a vaguely placed ending probably is meant to lead us into the next books in the series for us to find out more. Here is a word from the author about the end, for she knows best why that was accomplished in that way, and it will probably put things into perspective for you, the read, as to how to approach the end the way Lois Lowry might have intended it.<br /><br />\\"Many kids want a more specific ending to The Giver. Some write, or ask me when they see me, to spell it out exactly. And I don't do that. And the reason is because The Giver is many things to many different people. People bring to it their own complicated sense of beliefs and hopes and dreams and fears and all of that. So I don't want to put my own feelings into it, my own beliefs, and ruin that for people who create their own endings in their minds.\\"<br /><br />I have my own personal relationship to this book, and it has become a strong part of me. It's made its mark on me. It's truly one of those book you have to read in your lifetime. I absolutely loved it. I will be coming back to it throughout life, it's just one of those timeless books for both children and adults.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|On its own this version might do relatively well, but it seems a mere shadow of the BBC version starring Alec Guinness.  I found the tone very different.  There is desperation in the first, certainly, but it is offset by British humor, and more importantly, a warmth that comes through the stiff upper lip.  To me, the first ultimately was a film about the value of human relationships, while this felt nihilistic by comparison.<br /><br />In its own right it is a tight, intelligent movie.  Nonetheless I thought they botched Connie, and somehow the characters felt unbalanced -- Collin Firth as Bill Haydon stands too far apart from other members of the Circus.  Gary Oldman is technically superb but feels a bit mechanical.<br />So if you have have the time, see the 1979 version as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game.  lots to do and cool for kids.  good graphics... only complaint is I wish things were easier to select when they overlap some.  again... really cool game... love it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a way to play games by winning points from winning a game. its also pretty fun for challenges. good luck with ur game
0345803485|1.0|I was very excited intially to read this book after all the publicity it recd. in the media.  I normally don't get swayed by the media but found it specially interesting as a topic like Eroticism was being discussed on public channels.  However, was very disappointed right from the start - to realize it is almost a teenage romance with a more detailed/crude form of sex being described.  I find the style very immature and language to be very inexperienced. Every sentence has 'Holy crap' or 'Holy Hell'. The 21 year old could not even say the word 'vagina' and kept on saying 'there'. Even High schoolers are more comfortable in saying these words.  The characters are not very well outlined. I am not sure how much experience has the writer had to even talk about a subject like this. I am most surprised that women really found it that exciting. Maybe the american society is much more prudish than all the soaps and movies seem to suggest. Anyways, I just cancelled my pre-ordered books of the trilogy which I had ordered in anticipation. I have read better books that still offer the titillation with story and language to go with it.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I would not have paid for this game had I known I would be done in an hour!!!!! Complete waste even if it was only a buck!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|so, I have always been a fan of these types of games, and this one is no different.  to the people complaining about waiting for energy, that's not a problem if you loan ahead. and most of these wait 5 mon to give you one energy, this one is only 3!<br /><br />next are the people talking about the kindle toolbar, if you go to options (it looks like a little watch thing) the toolbar actually comes back!<br /><br />my only complaint is that I had a glitches and it added like 11 hours to the timers on everything! gameloft should really look into that!<br /><br />I hope this has been helpful to someone out there!

B0071MV540|2.0|I don't understand how you can have a cast like this and still produce a boring movie. I fell asleep about half way through.<br />Good thing it was just a rental. I didn't even have the urge to try and finish it later. That's how \\"good\\" it is.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I loved this game , but then I shut it off and when I checked it after all my timers were reset to 80 hours. fix
B0034G4OUY|4.0|The Rock plays an ex-con who seeks revenge on his brothers killers. This movie will blow your head off from the first few minutes of watching. A surprisingly awesome performance from the Rock, definitely not your typical performance from the guy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Seems fun and interesting to build town.  Works well with kindle fire.  Takes a while to load, but otherwise a good time waster.

B00003CX8N|5.0|I was very pleased to find one of my all-time favourite movies on DVD.  I recently ordered four older movies on DVD format.  Of the four this is the only one that had not only good, but excellent, video quality.<br /><br />The film was exactly as ordered; the DVD quality great.

B0002JP4L4|1.0|NO stars.  It's a wonderful movie, but the image quality is awful.<br /><br />This is the second of four DVDs I purchased from Amazon last week.<br /><br />Three of them were supposed to be in wide-screen format.  They were not.<br /><br />The image quality on this DVD is grainy, dull, speckled...I don't know the technical terms...but it's terrible.  It looks as though the movie was taped off of a television set, with a cell phone, and then transfered to a DVD.<br /><br />This DVD not worth buying.  The movie is great!  The presentation on the DVD is awful.  I have the old, origial video tape of this movie.  I'll find a used video player and watch it.  The image quality will be better.
B005H9B44A|5.0|My boys really love this movie and the clarity of it is great, especially on the kindle fire. I like that we were able to buy and download it so that we can watch it without WiFi.

B000F8O35U|4.0|Great storyline.  Predictable, as most Disney romances are.  The vast majority of the movie is great for all ages, but there is a brief time where things could be a little too intense for younger children.  But, the video is extremely well done...what else would you expect from Disney?
B00756GKBA|2.0|This album is nothing like 'Confessions on the Dancefloor', or even 'Hard Candy'. It is light years away from pop classics like 'Like a Virgin' or 'True Blue'. The album is just horrible in so many ways, lyrically is high school talent show mediocre and a pain to listen to from top to bottom, only a couple of songs deserve a replay. It is her worst album. 'American Life' is great compared to this. Madonna has no excuse: 80's pop star icon Kim Wilde is also in her early 50's and delivered two great albums in less than a year ('Come out and play' in 2010 and 'Snapshots' in 2011, check them out, they are fantastic and Kim's voice is better than ever), Kate Bush also gave us two great albums ('Director's Cut' and '50 words for snow' both in 2011). While Kim Wilde and Kate Bush are in tune with her music fans and are delivering great albums in a smart, classy and relevant way, Madonna lost her magic touch with this new album, seems she is out of touch with those who used to buy her records in the past too.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|The premise of the book is great and the opening chapters hold high interest.  Unfortunately the middle 500 pages do nothing to re-enforce it.  Mentioning JFK in the beginning and tossing it around at the end while shooting off on a completely different story in the middle ( with vague JFK references) does not make for a stellar zillion page book.  This could have been done much better in one of Mr King's novella type works.
0757302661|4.0|As a hypnotherapist myself, I got this book to aid me in birthing my child.  For me, the book by itself is helpful enough for me to figure out the rest on my own and the CD has some useful affirmations.  I was disappointed however in there being no breathing help except for to direct people to the class.  The class isn't available to me but I still want to birth naturally.<br /><br />I also think she takes a fundamentalist view and I could have used more actual useful information and less dogmatic preaching.  I'm reading the book because I want natural childbirth, I don't need to be convinced.  And be careful of the \\"us vs. them\\" created between doctors/hospitals and expectant parents.  If someone is birthing ini a hospital, the key for me is to find out how to work withwhile still taying natural.  Treating them like the enemy will not help me to have a pleasant birth nor will it reduce my anxiety.<br /><br /> Update... My birth was fabulous.  After reading many reviews, I decided not to be shocked if there was pain.  There was pain but was totally ok and birth was smooth, quick & natural.  The best thing we did was listen to CD some nights, do some perineal massages and talk about how we could make things smoother. From all of this,<br />,  wec were very connected & ready for birth.  Book was supplemental for us and really just helped with mindset.  Our best way to do contractions was one at a time.  By him constantly getting me to stay in the present I didn't psyche myself out & my body stayed relaxed and did its thing.  We got to the pushing in record time (yes I had to push but only like 4 times) it was over.  Thank God for the quick easy birth because cord was around her neck.  If it had been a long hard labor she probably would not have been in as good of shape as she was.  I upped stars from 2 to 4 because this book had a part in helping my daughter in a big way.  Just keep your expectations realistic, this book is just a tool.<br /><br />Also, I found a hospital certified by UNICEF as baby friendly, wrote a concise, polite and humorous birth plan that scored me a natural birth friendly nurse and was supported through birthing & breastfeeding almost the whole time.  I do not recommend going in guns-a-blaxing against the institution.  However, my husband & I were very informed on many possibilities so we were ready when one dodo night nurse tried to get me to give kiddo formula.  Glad I didn't.  My point is.... We knew our stuff and picked hospital & doctor carefullybut we were open minded and funny and relaxed and it made process at hospital awesome... We were absolutely open to actual medically necessary interventions, though it didn't come to that.  Hope this helps.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it reminds me of the old facebook game but its fun and a good way to spend time. froze on me once so far and had to reinstall though.
B003NXOASO|4.0|What they called GREASE in those times it's clear purity in our times. We see how a teenager is trying to make a girl whom he likes to notice him. Only other kids, who look at their leader as a role model are trying to make him to brag about the girl, but he is not very comfortable with their expectations. Later in another Travolta Epic \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" he comes backs to the same theme and once again it's still his admiration for the girl of his dreams, which makes any viewer to like him again. So tell me where is the GREASE? I see just a lot of Fever. And regarding the MUSIC, it's just GREAT, I love it all, that's<br />why I was not that crasy about Grease 2, even considering the fact that I sold part 2 LP for $15.00, but as a musical expirience it was just OK.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it keeps us busy when we dont have much to do some games should have instructions with but although its an ok game to keep you busy
0345803485|5.0|Wow this book is so intense and vivid, and you won't be able to stop reading it...or thinking about it!  Yes it has a lot of dirty scenes (a lot!) but the story is very intriguing too.  The author does a great job keeping the reader interested and wanting to know what happens.  Definitely a chick-book, but the man in their lives will be happy she's reading it too!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I don't care if you love or hate dogs, this is just a plain great read.  I took so much from this book.  The most important to me is that we don't listen to each other.  When someone is talking we are too busy thinking of what we are going to say that we just don't let people tell their story.  I had BIG reservations about reading this book because I didn't want to cry.  I'm glad I read it.  This author did a fantastic job and the journey through this book was amazing to ME.  I have read a lot of books and I am a speed reader, I skip descriptions etc. Not this book.  Many times I don't even remember a book even after reading the inside cover...not this book.  I will always remember reading THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|very good movie/ very Alex.Payne/Clooney excellent acting. Good support cast./ sometimes kinda slow moving plot, took forever to get to the heart of it(not till abt the end). Surrounding plots ok but not great.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I rented this many years ago when Blockbuster was still around and I found it very disturbing for various reasons.<br /><br />Young girls are kidnapped and tortured, specifically girls, towards the end the movie provides its own theoretical reason; remember, its fiction.<br />What appears to be truth on the surface, isnt necessarily the truth. And that groups of evil are integrated into normal society, where family members know what is happening, the evil that occurs in their residence - not to them, but to others, and it should provide insight as to how far people who really believe in something will go to accomplish a goal.<br />In my opinion, the french are notorious for delivering something cold and clinical, but that is deeply disturbing. This movie is about how a large organization kidnaps and tortures people in order to put them in some kind of waking state where they are in the afterlife, but are still alive (thats what i figured), and that the organization hopes to glean information or a knowing from their victims. Any organization that does this is evil.<br /><br />The content of the film is deeply disturbing, but it opened my eyes to the possibility that such things might exist and in that way it increased the view.<br /><br />I did not watch the un-rated version; based on previous comments, much of the torture was graphically shown, I watched the short version where whatever happened was after the fact...wouldnt have been able to stomach the graphic version.<br /><br />Gave the film 5 stars becuase it was deeply disturbing, and it showed what evil people are willing to do to gain spiritual knowledge.
0345803485|5.0|I am totally hooked on Christian Grey. I could not put this, nor book 2 down.  I want to keep reading and reading.  These books are stimulating, erotic, sweet, sad, happy, draining, etc. I hope Fifty Shades will go on and on.
B005Q5OLC2|5.0|This book delights at many levels. For one who grew up in the south east of Ireland in the 1950-60s it transported me back to many familiar sights, sounds, smells and moments - with uncanny accuracy. The delectation is in the detail and Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has his details spot on. Mrs Kelly's shop, the Sunday night dance, early Mass, the Courtown Hotel, Curracloe and Ballyconnigar strand all evoke vivid memories. The petty snobbery, importance of appearances, and the social catastrophe of mass forced emigration are captured with a light touch, without anything actually being said about them.<br /><br />Indeed it is the absence of saying anything about anything important that is probably the salient impression I take from the novel. Real issues are never discussed openly by the main characters or sometimes not at all. We Irish are masters at skirting the subject, dropping hints, making snide comments, raising an eyebrow to deliver a message but rarely are we ones for coming out in the open, addressing an issue up-front. We are certainly better than we were but the old ways of buttoned-up silent emotions that T&oacute;ib&iacute;n lays out brilliantly remains our default stance.<br /><br />What is exceptional about the main character Eil&iacute;s Lacey is that she is endowed with heightened intuition for a young woman of her age and time. She can see into and beyond what people say to what they are thinking and feeling and her capacity for discernment is breathtaking. Her poise and manner set her apart but her inability to freely express her own inner emotions eventually is her undoing.<br /><br />Denial runs through these pages as a leitmotif. Eil&iacute;s's recently dead father is hardly mentioned, the harrowing feelings of everyone concerned at her departure for America (including her own) and other later events are never expressed, tears are shed in private, major issues are avoided or left to simmer, letters are written without crucial content, joy, love, ecstasy are barely acknowledged. T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has illustrated an innate Irish ethnic trait in the most subtle yet damming way - by slowly and painstakingly unearthing its essence while never actually naming it. He learned his manners well in Enniscorthy.<br /><br />The other themes of the book for me are emigration and women. The experience of a houseful of Irish emigrants in Brooklyn is brilliantly portrayed but it could be mirrored by similar groups in any part of England at the time, except for the particular constraints imposed by the distance from home. Lack of education meant limited opportunity and the Irish tended to huddle together for support and comfort. The beneficent influence of the Catholic Church gets its due as a bulwark of strength in a somewhat hostile environment. What is absent is any sense of frustration, anger or betrayal that this should be the lot of these young people - deserted by a nation pledged to cherish them. And that too is authentic. It is only in recent times that Irish people have moved beyond mute acceptance of forced mass emigration and started to ask the why questions.<br /><br />Apart from Fr Flood who helps Eil&iacute;s in Brooklyn there is hardly another major male character. T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has a sub-plot here as well I suspect. In the official Ireland of government, news, church, and commerce it was only men who were seen or heard. Women were confined behind the lace curtains but that did not diminish their power exercised in ways that men neither understood nor felt. This is a hymn of praise to Irish women of that era who did not merely suffer in silence but rose above it to act with dignity, sense, courage and humility as beautifully revealed in the portraits of Eil&iacute;s, her mother and her sister Rose. For accuracy sake the narrow mindedness and cruelty of other women is there too in Mrs Kelly and Mrs Kehoe but their parts merely serve to highlight the heroism of the Lacey women. Like many mothers and daughters of their time duty was what counted - knowing it and doing it come what may--and never letting the side down.<br /><br />The book left me with much to remember and much to regret. As I wallowed in the nostalgia T&oacute;ib&iacute;n craftily created I began to become uneasy and a sense of foreboding accompanied every page turn. As Eil&iacute;s got happier I become more alert, more aware of impending doom. In that older Ireland joy was not just fleeting it was distrusted and discouraged. \\"You'll soon get your comeuppance me boyo!\\" And just on cue T&oacute;ib&iacute;n brought me down to earth--but bless him--he didn't leave me totally devastated at the end.e what may--and never letting the side down.<br /><br />The book left me with much to remember and much to regret. As I wallowed in the nostalgia Tóibín craftily created I began to become uneasy and a sense of foreboding accompanied every page turn. As Eilís got happier I become more alert, more aware of impending doom.

B003YUC2FE|4.0|These are some of the best movies that Disney has to offer and they come in this large collection.  I only bought it because I didn't own any of them on blu-ray and it was 50% off.  A really good deal.<br />The quality of these blu-rays is flawless in every aspect.  Its great that the set also comes with the dvds and digital copies.<br />I do have to agree,however, that the packaging is a bit of an oversight.  Having to grab each disc by the edge is a pain since there is no way to do so without smudging them with finger prints.  It happens no matter how careful you are.<br />That is the only complaint I have with the product though.  I am still happy with my purchase and it was worth it to me.  I would really only recommend this to those who don't have the movies already on blu-ray.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book the best of all. Wish there was a way to give it 6 stars! I really hope EL James takes it to the next level and elaborates more on Christains side and thoughts. Awesome job! Great read!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The story of the third book is very good, but I confess I liked better the first two.<br />The tension, the questions the characters (especially Katniss) ask themselves, and the kind of attitude they have for each difficulty are better created in the first two books.<br />Anyway, the third book is really good, I normally don't want to quit until the end of the \\"scene\\".<br />I recommend this book, especially for those who read the first two. It would be a pity not to finish the trilogy.<br />Now let's see how they reproduce them in the screen.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|its just like Mario but for tablet it gets frustrating but its kk my friend hares it it makes her mad but I think its ok.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|I am in a creative writing class taught by an author. She heard my short story and told me to pick up this book and read it to see how to link \\"events\\" and \\"stories\\". UGH. I am slogging through this book. The language is awful. I didn't laugh to myself or outloud. I didn't read anything in this other than stories from life. Why not just write a memoire?<br /><br />The events are not in chronilogical order. I did not find the stories about drug use funny. The  sarcastic stories about his siblings came off as mean and disconnected. I feel obligated to finish this book because my writing teacher wanted me to read it, but I am so not looking forward to it. I wish I could ask my teacher to reimburse me the $10.00 I spent on the book for my kindle.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar to the older version of Mario brothers ... at least to start... I hope it gets better and more evolved as the levels increase.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|If I was just reviewing the film, I'd have given this a 5 out of 5.  This is an outstanding horror film.<br /><br />The film follows our two protagonists, Katie and Micah, a young couple. Micah, Katie's somewhat skeptical and foolish boyfriend, has recently bought a camera and plans on documenting the so-called presence that seems to be following Katie, and manifesting itself as some sort of haunting.<br /><br />The film is great, and follows a good \\"less is more\\" philosophy, relying more on creeps and subtle scares (loud noises or doors opening and closing by themselves, etc) then on gore or monsters.  It was good in the theater, but is even better when viewed at home, in the dark with friends or family or even by yourself.<br /><br />The DVD and Blu-Ray release, though, is fairly weak.  There are no real special features to speak of (save for one alternate ending), which is a shame.  We know for fact that there is a second alternate ending floating around online, in addition to unused footage and a commentary track the director recorded for the UK release (from what I've heard), so it's kind of annoying that the American R1 release got passed up on for special features.<br /><br />In addition, although more of a nit-pick, I have to complain about something else with the Blu-Ray.  The two sequels both included not only the Blu-Ray disc, but also a DVD AND Digital Copy, whereas this film only includes the Blu-Ray and digital copy...  No DVD, which is annoying, as although I have a Blu-Ray player, I don't have one in every room with a TV, so some rooms still only have regular DVD players, so it's limiting for now until I upgrade the rest of my stuff.<br /><br />But all in all, good film, sub-par release for the R1 territories, but still worth buying for the great thrills and chills it provides.
B005NPCUC8|1.0|I've been trying to replace music that has been misplaced over the years and I picked up this version as an MP3 download. This remaster has ruined the flow of this album. At the end of every song the smooth transition that existed in the original vinyl and cd versions are gone. After attempting to listen to it once, I can't even bring myself to listen to it in the remastered form again.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Very suprised no songs from this albumn made it to radio...solid album. Comparable to Working on Dream album.  Radio Nowwhere is especially catchy tune.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Geeky, goofy fun.  The prose is pretty lackluster and a bit over-written at times, and the characters generally fell a bit flat, but the story was original, engrossing, and overall very entertaining.  I'm not surprised to hear that there's a movie in development; it definitely felt like a quirky summer adventure flick.
B005COO1X6|1.0|This was a ridiculous story (including the reference to Christine).  From the car that eats many people to the crazy melting tires that magically form back into their original state, I hated every word!  Whatever happened to the Stephen King stories of the past with intricate plots that were imagininative but somewhat believable?  If I could rate this with negative stars I would.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|same of theses games or very hard to play put I like this app its gun to try to bet each game.I'll give it 5stars................
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|What a great show!  Well done, really brings the books to life.  Looking forward to season 2!  Just don't get attached to any characters ...

B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you're a Mario fan this game is made for you the bad thing is that their is no bosses
0553386794|1.0|Not badly written, but I found it boring.  The characterizations aren't bad, but nowhere near worthy of the hype this book (and the series) is getting.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|had this app for a while and used it quite a bit. I was really enjoying it until I came to the problem I am having now. I cannot upload any of my pics anymore to edit. I don't know why its doing that cuz it has let me do it lots of times before? please help bcuz I would love to continue using this app. thank you!! if this problem gets fixed I would def rate this  5 stars
B0073U2FB2|3.0|I was entertained from the beginning to the end. The actors/actress were pretty<br />decent, and the effects were pretty good.  This is one of those good old alien<br />invasion movies that is worth watching. Nice to see Moscow and you are not stuck<br />in one place like lots of movies these days. So its like a little adventure as they<br />try to survive the Aliens. The script is well written and there are enough things<br />to keep you entertained.  Sorry...not too much blood and gore in this one, as the<br />destruction of humans is done in a different way.<br />A keeper.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you only have a few minutes,  the easy to play minigames are great!  However, if you like unlocking everything in one day this is not for you. Games are unlocked by points and offers.<br />The games increase in difficulty. Prepare to be challenged,  frustrated,  but never bored.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a very relaxing game.music is awesome .I'm glad it works on my kindle fire .gonna get it on my evo too
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find the Bible with the sound on to be entertaining and refreshing. cannot wait for the narrator to read the next passage., keeps burning and yearning for more.
B007B8H97Q|5.0|Only recently did I become a Downton Abbey fan, catching up on Season One and Season Two episodes in a couple of weeks.  The Season Two final episode is spectacular, and leaves fans hungry for the start of Season Three.  You'll definitely want to watch the finale more than once! Enjoy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have played several other games like this and this is my favorite.  controls work surprisingly well and the theme is clever.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I've got a Panasonic Bluray Player hooked up to a Samsung 55 LED and I couldn't be more pleased with the picture and sound.  The movie looks almost 3D, the sound is awesome through my Yamaha Soundbar.<br /><br />So regarding the movie, it is awesome.  Just make sure you have a system that can bring out the best in the Bluray.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|For those fortunate enough to know Georgette Heyer's work already, you know that she was a brilliant story teller who wrote romances, not SMUT! So if you are looking for sex, try another author. If you enjoy a well written love story, buy Georgette Heyer!<br />I've read almost every book that Georgette Heyer wrote, and this has to be my favorite! I can never read it without being pulled into the story. And even though I can recite parts of it by heart, it never fails to make me laugh and cry. A truely wonderful story!
1401937519|5.0|A fascinating story that must be read with both skepticism and an open-mind at the same time. Clearly something \\"serious\\" and wonderful happened to Anita and since it can be corroborated by doctors who don't have an agenda and whose professional reputations are at stake, I'm inclined to believe her. I learned about her (before Dr. Dyer's plug) via the internet after watching some interviews on YouTube. She seemed so sincere and believable that I knew I wanted to read her book when it came out.<br /><br />What cannot be denied is that the healing took place, the rest of course, could be fabricated to sell books. However, my sense of it is that she's quite sincere and that whatever happened was so \\"real\\" to her that it healed her. There's nothing pretentious about her writing. She shoots straight and it reads easily. Most people will fly through the book as I did. She doesn't try to put a spiritual or religious \\"spin\\" on what happened but simply describes it. If I can find any \\"fault\\" at all with this book it is that she does repeat herself from time-to-time but it's on important points that bear repeating. The last third of the book is probably the most interesting, in terms of her describing her own understanding of what transpired and why, so be patient as she chronologically sets-up the circumstances. I found it to be a breath of fresh air. I've been recommending it, wholeheartedly, to everyone I know.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an excellent app for taking notes that will effectively sync with all your devices, no matter what platform you use.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A must have for ALL Sci-Fi Nuts!! Like Me... Robbie the Robot is just the greatest in his film debut and Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis and Leslie Nielson are just magnificent, not to mention the supporting cast. Look for People you've seen in many other movies, TV shows and stage. Get it in Blue-Ray its Fantastic!!!!
B00756GKBA|4.0|Ok boys and girls here is my review of Madonna's latest release, MDNA.<br /><br />Like most of us, I was anxiously awaiting the release of Madonna's new CD, MDNA. After a steller Super Bowl Half Time performance -<br /><br />excluding the first single released \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\" (my opinion) and a rather opininated 20/20 interview, I was stoked to hear what was on M's mind artisticly. I assumed there would be 2 or 3 good songs and then a bunch of fluff. I was secretly hoping I would be wrong. Did she disapoint me? We'll get back to that question in a minute.<br /><br />MDNA starts off strong with the hot and danceable single and second release \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", which I love. Then we get clubby with \\"Gang Bang\\" and \\"Im Addicted\\". Both of which I also enjoy . Then we switch gears with \\"Turn Up The Radio\\". Hmmm (one eyebrow cocked). And then \\"Give Me All Your Lovin'\\" (the remix should have been the single). \\"Some Girls\\" is so so, and \\"Superstar\\" is super DOOPER stupid. She regains my faith that the collection will get better with \\"I Don't Give A\\"...love it! \\"I'm A Sinner\\", heard it, remember \\"Beautiful Stranger\\". From here the only thing worth mentioning is \\"Masterpiece\\", which is a beautiful ballad and definitely worth the Golden Globe achievment.<br /><br />Do I hate it? No. Do I love it? No. Is it what I expected? Yes. Did she disapoint me? No. it was exactly what I assumed it would be. ;)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really fun and challenging game. Some levels require a little thinking but all are solvable. Could not put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Brings back memories. Great way to pass time. Easy to use and fun. I like that you get little missions to accomplish.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a fun game to play. It's like playing Mario Bros but Irish. Fun for the kids and adults.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a well designed game with a simple yet fun premise. Great when you need to kill a few minutes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm just utterly amazed at the quality of this story. This will be the new standard to which other stories will be compared or judged. Hugh renders an incredible amount of detail in the narrow confines of each story and much as those who live in the silo, you live inside of it, but you can't help but be curious as to what exists beyond. Howey is able to solder emotional wires to connect you directly to the characters emotions of fear, hope, curiosity, fatigue, paranioia. I'm not clastophobic by nature, but through several pages I fell as such.<br /><br />I could not tell you that I favored one story over another, they are each rich in detail as the story unfolds.  There is no room for filler here. Each story moves you deeper into the characters and Howley carefully balances hope and dispair, isolation and unity and each story is appreciable in its own right.<br /><br />I started with checking out Wool from the Kindle library, and had to then buy the Omnibus to get the full story [Well done Amazon, well done Hugh!].<br /><br />This is a landmark time for brilliant and lesser known authors to surface and be known not for the publisher or publicist but for the pure quality of their product supported by the community of readers.
1451627289|4.0|This is a surprising book for Stephen King. Even people who don't like King will enjoy this. It's suspenseful and full, and it fortunately doesn't have as much of King's droning on and on as some of his other giant novels do. My only real complaint about the book is how quickly it wrapped up at the end. It feels like he was up against deadline and had to tie up a pretty little package more quickly than the story demanded.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a very good puzzle game that was almost addicting. just difficult enough to keep me wanting to play. i would reccomend getting this game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy the different types of games and the challenge of beating the game. Its worth downloading. This game is fun for all ages.

B0055SWM08|4.0|fantastic game. so simple yet challenging. I recommend this to anyone the likes puzzles or just trying to waste time
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Nice little light weight sharpener. I'm putting it in my tacklebox to use on my fishing knife. I'll also be able to sharpen my hooks with the steel. I like the fact that the stone and carbide parts can be flipped when they wear out.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game is really fun. I guess. i don't know try it out for yourselves. its pretty much like all the other games by hem
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best game app I have downloaded for the kindle fire.  you should definitely try it out today.
B002IFT1ZA|1.0|I do love Game of Thrones; it's a well-done series. However, after paying good money for the DVD I was upset to find that I was forced to watch commercials for HBO's other series' at the beginning of the disks. I expect commercials for free content, but after paying for a box set I expect to be able to skip the junk and just play the show. Three and a half minutes of garbage at the beginning really ruined the mood for me. Forcing people to view commercials on a purchased DVD is a good way to persuade fans to download torrents instead.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|wow I love this game. its so fun. the little lep is so cute u should buy this game nowww
B000000H57|5.0|Type O Negative are one of my favorite bands of all time. It took until October Rust for me to really get into them though. I liked Bloody Kisses but October Rust is a masterpiece. It's the perfect mix of their heavier and more melodic Type O Negative. If you like any type of gothic or doom metal/rock than I'd highly recommend October Rust, definitely one of my top albums of all time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|with calming music and just an all around good puzzle game. Some puzzles are harder than others, especially if it drives you crazy not to complete the puzzle in the least amount of moves. I too wasn't sold by the review/description but as Amazon's FAOTD I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did.
B00757J98K|4.0|Madonna just released this album - four years after \\"Hard Candy\\" (which I loved - Great CD).  Seems like maybe she shouldn't have waited so long!  Not only is she getting up there in age (wince!) but this is some really good stuff!  BEWARE though of the songs I hated and only gave one star... \\"I F****d Up\\" which is strange, dull, and just sounds weird with Madonna saying that in such a slow song; and \\"Gang Bang\\" which I immediately learned to skip and not let it play while jamming in my convertible with the top down.  Because it is ridiculous and humiliating - really humiliating.  I love - LOVE and give 5 stars to \\"I don't give a\\" and \\"Masterpiece\\".  Those songs are AMAZING.  Four stars go to almost as good songs are \\"Give me all your love\\", \\"Superstar\\", and \\"Bday Song\\".  Three stars go to \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Beautiful Killer\\", and \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", I'm a Sinner\\", \\"Falling Free\\", and \\"Turn Up The Radio\\", which I hear is the next single to be released after \\"Give Me all Your Love\\".  Why, I can't understand.  Maybe they are trying to appeal to teenagers instead of people my age (42) who grew up with Madonna and are still around.  We are the ones going to her concerts; no teenager is gonna drop $500.00 on a couple of tickets to see a (admittedly remarkably HOT) 53 year old woman who is old enough to be their grandma.  Then we have two stars for still listenable \\"Love Spent\\", \\"Best Friend\\", and \\"I'm Addicted\\".  Oh Madonna, please continue making these quality  songs... we love you.  P.S. I dropped the $500.00 on those tickets... hope it's a good show!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very very very addictive game. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend this game to friends, did I mention I love it!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Why all the crankiness.  Love the challenge and  new take on an old game.  I think i got it for free but i wpuld have paid for it.  Giving 5  to offset the less generous reviews.
B007MC868M|5.0|After the horror of the serial murders in The Snowman and The Leopard, Harry Hole leaves Oslo for Hong Kong, with no intent to return.  But, three years later, he's back.  Not because of another serial killer, but for more personal reasons.<br /><br />When Harry arrives, everything in Oslo seems old and new at the same time.  Oslo is a city with a serious drug problem.  That's not new.  What is new is the highly addictive drug called \\"violin.\\"  It's playing so many of the city's young people, including Oleg, the son of Harry's former lover, Rakel.<br /><br />Oleg's friend, Gusto, has been murdered and Harry investigates--even though he's no longer in the police force and some of his old colleagues are more than a little bit hostile to him.  In alternating stories, we read about Harry's investigation and the events leading to Gusto's murder.  Although Harry and Rakel agreed many years before that it was too dangerous for Rakel and Oleg to have Harry to be in their lives, Harry still feels like Oleg's father and will do anything to help him.<br /><br />Gusto's story is told in his own voice, speaking to his long-gone biological father.  Nobody ever had anything good to say about Gusto's father, and Gusto is a sociopath, but the one person in the world Gusto feels compelled to prove himself to is his absent father.  As Oleg asks Harry: \\"Don't all boys see their fathers as heroes?\\"<br /><br />The Phantom is a return to form for the Harry Hole series after the digressions into long, convoluted serial killer stories in The Snowman and The Leopard.  The Phantom is also (almost) free from the gruesome and extended torture descriptions and ridiculously unlikely escape sequences that marred those books, especially The Leopard.  That doesn't mean that The Phantom is any walk in the park, though.  Nesbo pulls no punches in describing the degraded life of drug addicts and the way the drug trade corrupts everything and everyone it touches--not just the buyers and sellers.  We see the whole lineup of chemists, policemen, politicians and other middle-class worthies who are involved in the drug trade and hear the lies they tell themselves to justify their choice.<br /><br />This is a gripping police procedural/thriller, but with real feeling.  The last two chapters, in particular, are stunning, heartbreaking and unforgettable.  If you're a regular reader of the Harry Hole series, you'll want to read this as soon as possible, before somebody spoils the plot for you.the whole lineup of chemists, policemen, politicians and other middle-class worthies who are involved in the drug trade and hear the lies they tell themselves to justify their choice.<br /><br />This is a gripping police procedural/thriller, but with real feeling.

B0055SWM08|4.0|well done. easy to pick up and great for when you are looking g for a game that can be played for 5 minutes or 45 minutes.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it's not so much &quot;the Oregon trail&quot; as it is the epilogue, wherein you've arrived at the end and build a town. it's fun, though mindless. at first running out of energy really annoyed me but then I learner to appreciate the self-limiting aspect. I need more friends (ambyrle) and I'm good about returning favors :)
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great game love it. could not put it down .played when ever had a free minuet .clear details pictures where easy to see and had lots of hard angels.
0385342063|3.0|Typical Sophia Kinsella, charming and easy on the spirit. Not as good as her best, better than her worst. I especially appreciated that she gave the leading lady some professional expertise.
B005NS5CX4|4.0|Was just what i expected. Works great. Love the 4th track on cd, had not heard it on the radio yet.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Adds sound quality to your videos! I have a Canon EOS 60D & adding this stereo mic has been a big plus. I've had no issues using this mic at all. Very simple to setup & use. The connecting audio cable is never in the way; not too short, not too long - just right. The sound quality is robust compared to the built-in mono mic. Go for it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|many people thunk that this app is a piece of junk bt it isnt its really addicting just get the app n try it out if u dont like it then delete it GOODNESS GRASHOUS!!!!!!!!
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Watched a movie with my lovely last night here's my review:<br /><br />A Quantum of Solace:<br />As an average American even the title confuses me, let alone the plot. This horrible movie opens with a chase and fight scene, one of many which seem to occur about every 10 minutes with such shaky camera work that I found myself loathe to even be watching. It starts in Caribbean island of Haiti with some import export villain trying to corner the market on water, from what I can gather. I suppose the movie makers were bored with the scenery so we find ourselves in Bregenz/ Austria watching TOSCA, the opera, where our villains are discussing their nefarious plots using tiny earpieces. And that's about it for the story. There are two beautiful lead women; one of which is murdered, then covered with motor oil on a nice white bed in a fancy hotel in Germany. I found myself worried about how the sheets would be cleaned. The movie wandered about so much that it left me confused as to why I was even watching, except for the $2.99 I wasted! Most of the usual bond elements existed in the movie: lovely ladies check, fat general, check, expensive car being ruined, check, airplane crash, building blowing up, motorboats, check and check. Strangely, Moneypenny and Q (the gadget guy were missing). Next time I'm going for Gilligan's Island, you see, it's about these seven castaways stuck on an island surrounded by water. Even the title makes sense. I'll have to find a teenager to explain to me what the bond movie was about. I'll give it one star for the motor oil scene (which didn't make any sense in the movie).
B0063GORYU|5.0|Wonderfully addictive. gotta love a good card game to clear the mind and relax the body. Mobilityware's version is a definite favorite.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have all the Angry Birds little games and they are very entertaining like at airports and just about anywhere when you want to kill time and have fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm not a gamer but I love it. Having hints keeps it from being frustrating. The hints also teach me the tricks I need to learn.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very simple idea, well executed. I usually turn the sound down on all the games I play, but the music on this one is soothing and perfect for the game. It sets the mood. the boards are challenging, but not ridiculous. Awesome!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Clean, graphics are the best I've seen on a Calculator program for the fire. Buttons are absolutely huge, don't pay any attention to reviews to the contrary. Those guys must be either on a phone, or just being ridiculous.
B001W9EUC2|5.0|Great product, fast shipment excellent price , highly recommended, product was received as described, great packaging, I will bought the other 2 blu ray of the IP Man trilogy very soon.
B007G5GYHA|4.0|I think the creators did a wonderful job in developing the plot of the movie Puss In Boots. Oh, it doesn't follow the book, but it does appeal to 10-years old on up, especially with the addition of nursery rhyme charaters -- Humpty Dumpty -- for example. There wasn't a need, in MHO, to add the risque' moment. I did like the movie.
B00526ZKYS|3.0|I'd really like to evaluate this book. Mostly, because I bought it for the high praise of the reviewers here at amazon. BUT unfortunately this book just couldn't enthrall me at all up to page 90. Even if it gets better in the following pages, the premise of what I read was not really fascinating and the plot somewhat foreseeable (after I decided, that I won't read it to the end, I've read a summary of the plot to maybe be swayed by an amazing story).<br /><br />Anyway, if you're patient, maybe you might like it. I just don't wanna waste my time by reading so many boring pages right at the beginning of a story.
0805086846|5.0|This is a beautifully written and easy-to-read book.  It a heart-wrenching overview of the treatment of the native Americans at the hands of white settlers in the second half of the 19th century.  It should be required reading for all high school students, if for no other reason than that, as the saying goes, \\"When the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.\\"  Certainly, nothing in this book is part of the normal history curriculum for American students.  What a terrible shame.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wonderful before bed. Very relaxing and fun to play. It is worth paying for it. Great on my Kindle. passes the time.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|Tried this with my iPhone 4S.  With the phone held vertically, it's totally unstable.  With the phone held horizontally, it doesn't flop over but beware of a strong breeze :)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|When I was a teenager, my best friend's mother was a housebound farmer's wife who sat in her armchair all day reading one \\"flaming groin\\" romance novel after another- so I figured there must be something great in there and sneaked a few copies into my book bag. I loved the first one- so racy and sexy to my 14 year-old mind.  But since I was also heavily into more high-quality writers, the second and the third novels were incredibly boring and shallow- I just raced to the juicy bits and even those became mind-numbing and predictable.<br /><br />So 35 years later, the Fifty Shades trilogy really took me back to my first brush with this genre with the addition of mildly kinky content and lots of conspicuous consumption.  Initially stimulating but ultimately SO BORING!

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is a lovely story to keep both children and adults interested.  All of my grandchildren love this movie as do I and so will everyone.  I was truly happy that I could purchase this movie from Amazon because I couldn't find it any place else and I wanted my family to watch and enjoy Ponyo as much as I.
0375701427|5.0|When the WW II veterans raised children during the 1960's, only to see the youthful movement of the late 60's transcend into the Watergate hearings of the 1970's - many questioned what had happened to the country they defended in the 1940's.  Others demanded \\"love it or leave it.\\" And, the lead character of this book - Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov - can't seem to do either.<br /><br />A chameleon Jew, Levov is blonde and athletic.  His grace on the field made him the adoring eye of his predominantly Jewish classmen.  He is born and raised in the Weequahic section of Newark as the son of a successful Jewish-American glove manufacturer.  He starred in football, basketball and baseball - and even had a chance to play professional baseball.  Something no other of his neighborhood could earn.  He was also academic, and probably could have enrolled in great schools.<br /><br />Instead, he enlisted in the military, went to a local college, and married Miss New Jersey - who was as Irish Catholic as he was Jewish, as short as he was tall, as much woman as he was man.  The inter-family strife is cute, and the great religious discussion between Swede's father with the betrothed Dawn Dwyer becomes a trade for a baptism and the two major holidays for a bar mitzvah.<br /><br />Living amid the grand splendor of rural New Jersey,  his Newark glove manufacturing plant - Newark Maid - continues to produce gloves even though waning demand of the same ensues as glamour's evolution of miniskirts and other mod events make the newer women not love or want the hand items like their mothers once did.<br /><br />The city-raised Swede lives in pastoral America.  His wife gets her hands dirty by raising cattle.  His daughter is 4-F.  Everything seems lovely in their American existence. You can almost see their milk mustaches wiped off with grinning lips and a sweeping pink tongue.<br /><br />But, Swede realizes the opposite exists.  Almost like a horror film, his realization erupts at the end of the book when there is a family gathering.  In that event, he realizes his wife is having an affair with a couple's husband, he acknowledges a prior affair with another couple's wife, his daughter was hidden from him by an attendee, and then awkwardly a drunken visitor stabs his father with a fork.<br /><br />Swede's lovely life turns to the same depression seen in many novels written many decades prior to this - [[ASIN:0449911659 Rabbit, Run]][1960],[[ASIN:009956064X Revolutionary Road]] [1962], or [[ASIN:0142437298 Herzog]] [1964] come to mind. And, Roth can write well about depression.  And, that recipe can make for long hard passages which can depress the reader.book when there is a family gathering.

0307959856|3.0|To begin, I should specify that this was my first novel by P. D. James and my first Pride & Prejudice sequel, so I think my feelings are unbiased by comparisons. Whether this is to the detriment or to the benefit of the novel, I cannot say. I should also add that I was prepared to like this book--I enjoy mysteries, I've heard good things about James, and, most important, the book was a gift from my father. Despite all this, I was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />First, there is nothing to criticize in James's style. Although it lacked the sparkle and the exact cadence of Austen's writing, each sentence was interesting and each detail carefully chosen. I also greatly enjoyed Part I of the book, in which James fills in some of the gaps of the original. It's clear that she has spent a lifetime contemplating P&P, and her thoughts are honest and nuanced.<br /><br />However, in my opinion, the plot of the novel suffered from several problematic and confusing gaffes. First, although this novel is perfectly set up--by nature of it taking place at Pemberley the night before a ball (voil&agrave;, a country house and an assortment of out-of-town, independently wealthy guests)--to be an English country house mystery (or at least to earn some nods and winks to the genre) it neglects almost every convention. There is no detective character (professional, amateur, or otherwise), which means that the important details came to light only incidentally. In that way, the structure of the story more closely resembles a newspaper article than a murder mystery.<br /><br />Second, I think that James erred in choosing to off the least important or sympathetic character in the novel. I simply did not care who the murderer was, nor am I convinced that any of other the characters did either. The whole affair lacked a sense of intrigue or urgency, and the novel--left totally devoid of suspense--suffered accordingly.  Furthermore, no indications of the murder appeared earlier in the novel, robbing the reader of the anticipated sense of co-sleuthing. As opposed to everyone being under suspicion, no one was, and the only reason I guessed the murderer (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) is that I felt one of the characters entirely superfluous and deduced that his only conceivable purpose was to be revealed as the murderer at the end of the novel.<br /><br />An incidental complaint is that the novel's structure seemed poorly edited. Certain details or events were recounted or narrated time and time again by different characters. Instead of simply recounting that Darcy told Elizabeth what had happened (which the reader already knew), Darcy would explain the whole thing to Elizabeth, and then explain the whole thing again to Colonel Fitzwilliam, and possibly explain the whole thing again to any one else who happened to turn up.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most fatally, Elizabeth's character lacks every trace of sardonic wit so characteristic of her predecessor. Her dialogue is limited and, when present, straightforward.<br /><br />It could be argued that James made all of these choices deliberately and with a higher aim in mind. Regardless, the effect was missed. In the end, I would say that the book was worth the time spent reading it, but only barely.e reader of the anticipated sense of co-sleuthing.

B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Read the trilogy because so many people were talking about it.  Realized that it was this generation's version of Tolkien without the deep exploration of what fosters evil and helps it to flourish.  I kept waiting for for a confrontation of substance not just physical mayhem.  There were hints and then it was dropped.  By the 2nd book I had a ha-ha moment.  I realized the book was not a novel, it was/is a movie script.  Novels challenge the readers to create the world from the within - scripts are about the outside.  Once I knew whre I was I could continue, disappointed and yet see where the script went.  Seemed that the author got tired of the series and just let go of Katniss.  That she wouldn't be present at her trial?  Did not work for me.  I know it is a children's tale and that frustrated me even more.  This is the vision of the world for our young women - go out and kill people, watch your loved ones die and/or be tortured, become a heroine and then be quiet, get married and have children to whom you will not tell the truth of your life.  I REALLY hope that parents are discussing these books with their teens.  VIP issues and must be open with them.  Paints adults and power as totally corrupted and corrupting.  Not true and or truth.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good for all ages.  variety for all<br />  both my kids and I love it. cant wait to get more levels
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I was disappointed with the book.  Found it to be very light weight and in many ways guarded.  I was hoping for questions and insights.  Comedy requires great skill and daring and it would have been fun to be challenged by a better read.
0345803485|5.0|I am an avid reader, surprising people when I read books in a day or two, but, the Fifty Shades trilogy is the best set of books I have read.  I finished the first and bought numbers 2 and 3 immediately so I would not have to wait.  The way the stories take the world of BDSM and shows us another side of it, while incorporating a typical contract and such, is amazingly accurate.  I bet there are many women who, although maybe not as messed up, is wondering where they can find their own Fifty Shades of .......man.  These stories show us the kind of love, the depth, the ups, the downs, but mostly the unconditional, work through anything kind of love that we all want...It's that \\"more\\" and then some.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i am disabled and with so many games to choose from it really helps me to relieve stress.... thank you
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Excellent movie.  I would recommend it to others.  My daughter really enjoyed it.  It is more for girls than guys.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I highly recommend this game for all users. the ambient music is relaxing to the ear, while the puzzles are challenging and fun. it includes a high volume of puzzles for hours of time killing.
0439023521|5.0|I'm an avid reader.  I read for at least an hour every day.  I can honestly say that this is one of the best books I've ever read.  I'm not a big fan of 1st person narrative, but this book grabbed me from page one.  I finished it in two days!  The action is non-stop.  I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the trilogy. I'm tempted to download it, but I want a hard copy so that I can share it with my students.<br /><br />Absolutely a great story!  I can't wait to see how the story continues!
B0040ZN9WM|5.0|These are great shoes for toddlers!  My 2 year old can put them on all by herself.  She also hasn't gotten any blisters from them and she can wear them with everything from play clothes to dresses!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|It would be impossible and really unnecessary to comment on the greatness of the Beatles or this very special album.  Through all the years post Beatles reign, every possible accolade has been given to honor their vast accomplishments and success.  A superb job of putting this album together and totally appreciated by the recipient of this gift.  However, I experienced my first disappointment with Amazon - the shipment arrived sooner than expected, which was really nice, but minus the gift card I filled out that was supposed to be included.  No biggie, but it was almost returned as they thought it had been shipped to them by mistake.  I hope that doesn't happen with my next gift.  Still the best place in the world to shop, without a doubt, but if anyone is reading this they already know that!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|it is ok. gets kinda bboring pretty. fast cant complain tho. it was free and not bad. graphics are good
055338466X|5.0|We all know astrophysics, or just physics in general is a hard thing to understand, especially quantum theory. Mr. Hawking and Mr. Mlodinow simplify it enough to where average guys can get a grasp on some of the most stupifying concepts in mathematics and physics. As usual, Mr. Hawking injects his usual humor which in turn makes it even more of a joy  to read.

0061726826|5.0|Dear ms. Oliver - you broke my heart. I never cry and you made me cry. Your thoughtful writing is beautiful, though I think you went over board with over-the-top metaphors. Wonderful story - definitely not too slow-moving as others have said. One thing i love is that you don't brush over the dysutopian society. You develop the charaters so well and pay such good attention to detail that at times i actually cringed because i felt so in tune with your world.  Sigh, i love Alex. If only guys were like him. If anyone enjoys a gal being swept off her feet by a perfect guy with no flaws, than this one is for them. That said, the ending was awful and not appropriate, at all. It is SPOILER emotionally manipulating and I really don't appreciate it. Until the last forty pages, this was a four star. Now I'm uncertain that I'll even pick up the second book.<br /><br />EDIT<br />So I'm reading the second one. It's great so far and Ms. Oliver is becoming very comfortable with her style of dysutopian writing. A seasoned writer indeed. Lena is a warrior and I understand the ending of the first book, but I still don't like it. I love this series. I changed it to five stars.<br /><br />SPOILER for the sequal<br />Don't lose sleep over the loss of beautiful, perfect Alex...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love playing this game!  My kids like playing too. Reminds me of when I was a child and played this in school 23 years ago
B0055SWM08|5.0|At last an app. that is free and works well on kindle fire. This is a game that can be played anytime. It gives you a hint that is earned. The music is nice but I rarely play with sound. The setting is like a zen garden. The levels start out very easy and get harder as you progress through the levels. I would suggest this to people who enjoy puzzle type games. Be ready to put your thinking cap on!!! :)
B005VTS4EY|4.0|great game, challenging levels that steadily increase in difficulty. nothing special about the graphics. a good download, good time waster brain exerciser.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great just an awesome game much like Mario brothers wii and D's games I just love it some people say it ducks and it does
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a child of the video game era, but I love reading more than any other form of entertainment. My problem is that I am hard to please. I look at reading as a serious time investment. I don't want to waste my time reading dribble. I want books that allow me to escape to plausible worlds. I need the story to be believable and supported by meaningful explanations.<br /><br />Having said that, Wool is ABSOLUTELY worth the time (and small financial) investment. I started reading it 84 hours ago. I work a full-time job and have a wife and kid. I just finished Wool 5. I could not put it down. It was very gripping. The characters are very well developed and I genuinely care about what happens to them. I did feel a little despondent near the end when we discover a potential fate for a character. I almost wanted to put the book down because I thought someone else would be leaving the storyline. But the feeling of hope that the series builds on made me want to plow through to the end.<br /><br />Again, this is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoys quality writing. Can't wait for whatever comes next from Hugh Howey.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|Electric Light Orchestra  \\"A New World Record\\"  #5  (1976).<br /><br />Electric Light Orchestra was on a roll, after they struck platinum in 1975 for \\"Face The Music\\".  Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt went back to Munich, Germany to record the follow up \\"A New World Record\\".  This album would go on to sell over 5 million copies.  And oh what an album this is, not a weak track in sight.  You get the old Move hard rocker \\"Do Ya\\", which hit #96 in 1971, they would hit #24 this time around, this is a more polished piece, but the best version maybe on their box set \\"Flashback\\".  \\"Tightrope\\", with it's swirling strings, is a heavy pop-rocker.  \\"Rockaria\\", the operatic rocker, good slide guitar by Jeff Lynne.  \\"Shangri-la\\", lush orchestrated number with great drumming by Bev Bevan, nice Beatle name dropping.  \\"Livin' Thing\\", hit #13, a very good song.  \\"Telephone Line\\", #7, their highest charting hit up to this point, very John Lennon sounding.  \\"Mission (A World Record)\\", Richard Tandy shines here, one of Lynne's best vocals.  \\"So Fine\\", nice little pop-rockeer, with nimbling bass by Kelly Groucutt, this pre-dated \\"Discovery\\" by 3 years.  The bonus material has the 50's rave-up \\"Surrender\\".  The other stuff is passable, but not that interesting.  One of ELO's all-time best records.
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|One often wonders what happens to those great bands of the 1980s.  Too often, they forget their roots, and 'maneuver' to reach a new audience.  OMDs latest remains true to the band's origins, and is a great 14 track collection of new work.  If you loved their '80s music, you will love these songs, too.  I highly recommend History of Modern, and it will make you want to get out your other OMD albums and listen to them, as well.  Beware that the back of the CD lists 2 discs, but there is only one with all 14 tracks on it.
B005XN3150|4.0|I enjoy the show but it's premise will not be for everyone.  The season finale is not available yet and unfortunately I missed it.  Hopefully it will become available soon or the big build up will be a big letdown.  It has creative storylines that have a familiarity which  sometimes tantalizingly sends you in an unexpected direction.  Hope to look at the season finale without having to buy the whole season.  Think this is a show well worth viewing.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|for $2.99 I was expecting more! Didn't take me long to beat the game. didn't have any challenging levels. the space aspect was cool but this game isn't worth $2.99.
