B00CTERB2A|5.0|great show nice to catch up on all the seasons of a funny well written show.great great great great great
B000N5F6OW|5.0|Good old fashion Family  entertainment I would compare this motion picture to Donovans Reef,  and North to Alaska another classic.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Very interesting, and motivating.<br />While you won't necessarily have the same goals as James, he shows you that you have no valid excuse not to reach your goals.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|The main character is raised in an research setting which influences her later life and the lives of the other family members. There is also a heavy message about not harming animals which becomes more evident toward the end of the book.<br />It was a good read but I found the title misleading. I thought it would be a bunch of martini drinking folks becoming slightly hysterical at almost everything. It was far from that.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good first season! The show is a unique blend of political and legal issues. The characters have depth and are interesting to watch, especially Kalinda.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I found it quite easy to identify with an arthritic Labrador, The story is told from the dogs point .of view in a delightful way. The inner life of the dog is mixed with some auto racing impressions that included a fair amount of philosophy of living ideas. All this against a custody battle of gigantic proportion. It kept me engrossed and, being a dog lover, gently amused.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!!!  I can't get enough!!!  The show is so well done.  The actors are superb.  I am so wrapped up in their lives.  I can't wait to watch Season 4!!!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Gameloft you've done it again. Every game I have played of yours I have not only enjoyed but I have played over and over. But this is hands down in the top 3 best games. Not only are you the good guy but you get to play the bad guy too! How f&cent;$@ing ingenious ! I'm more than impressed with your games and yet you continue to blow my mind. 10 stars 2 thumbs up and keep at it. As long as u keep making games like this I don't care if there's a price tag I'm buying.
0812971825|4.0|I looked forward to Abide With Me ever since reading Elizabeth Strout's Pulitzer Prize winning novel Olive Kitteridge.  This novel, too, was deeply perceptive, intensely emotional, and full of irony and surprise.  The story's leading man, a strong, patient, sometimes stern young man, shows us the painful side of the human condition -- its conflicts, its tragedies, and the endurance it requires.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great story that intertwined between the lives of several women with a very interesting ending and analysis.  Kept me interested in reading it
1781162646|5.0|Haven't gotten to read this one yet but will soon, hope it's as good as all the rest, will have to wait and see
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great game I am always playing it what I would like to edit is<br />1.They need updates faster on the kindle 2. A update with villagers<br />And iron gloems 3.is they need to make it so you can collect redstone
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Its gotten so tough to figure out where Robert Downey ends and Tony Stark begins, I'll bet there are days that he can't figure it out, either. And, that's great news for fans of great adventure movies; because he is THE rock star of movie superheros.<br /><br />After the bloated self-importance of 'Iron Man 2', this third tale puts Mr. Stark exactly where we want him: in the most serious trouble; and, with nothing but his intellect, ego and eloquence to bail him out. Borrowing from the classic 'Extremis' comic-book arc, IM3 has Stark running from the nightmares he experienced in 'The Avengers', and discovering that old Buckaroo Banzai was right: \\"...no matter where you go, there you are.\\" This angst and and resulting burnout stresses the relationship between Stark and gal-pal Pepper Potts; and, in ways that will prove vital to the film's denouement. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to deftly blend Pott's quicksilver emotions towards her naughty-boy, Supersqueeze: exasperation, elation, devotion and the clear desire to take a maternal wooden spoon to his backside. She is more than his match.<br /><br />Guy Pierce, in yet another 2013 movie performance, proves to be a villain of charm, hubris and intellect who provides a very dark reflection for Stark to contemplate. In addition, the genesis of this new tale ties up elements going back to the first Iron Man movie; and, proves that our actions always catch up with us.<br /><br />Sound a little deep for a superhero flick? Not to worry. The cast and director massage it all in such a way, that it keeps your brain engaged, while providing the visual and auditory assaults we all demand of such movies.<br /><br />There is some well-managed humor from (former Iron Man director) John Favreau as bodyguard/factotum Happy Hogan; and, a kid 'sidekick' for Stark who manages to act like a kid, without becoming an obnoxious jerk (yeah, Short-Round...I'm talkin' to you).<br />Don Cheadle returns as \\"Rhodie\\"/War Machine/ Iron Patriot; and, there is a lot of fun watching this intense actor/character being mercilessly teased by his buddy.<br /><br />The story is suitably sinister, and Pierce's minions are as hiss-able as anyone could ask. A rollicking score, crystal cinematography and tight editing wrap this excellent cine-present up in a tidy bow.<br /><br />Oh, about those extras...<br />Start with 'Agent Carter', a short movie (\\"Marvel One-Shot\\") about Captain America's secret-agent sweetheart. It takes place a year after the end of 'Cap', and puts our Miss Carter at odds with evil spies and FBI male chauvinists, too (gasp!). An absolute little gem.<br /><br />In addition, there is a generous selection of the usual 'making-of' clips and outtakes. However, what I really got a kick out of were some clips of Downey vamping through scenes, at a mile-a-minute, until he gets the version that 'clicks' for him (and, ended up in the theatrical release).<br /><br />Top to bottom, this is 3 hours of soaring, solid action entertainment.<br />That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox!<br /><br />PJA
B00F91H666|3.0|As I said, it's OK.<br />It's a fun romp with action and a McGyver-ish hero that seems to be able to do it all...and the zombie-ish characters are kind'a scary.<br />I wasn't looking for a deep inner meaning so if you look at it as a fun romp you'll probably enjoy it also.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Another fun Angry Birds, the people at Rovio are insane.  Some new characters with different skills.  This works a little differently than the other angry bird programs but it is great fun.
B00E00RB5I|5.0|Earth Wind and Fire are one of the greatest bands of all time and have created one fantastic album. Other folks are sure to enjoy it as I have.
B000SEI230|5.0|this is an amazing book. I think that costumers would really enjoy this romantic story of two teens who fall in love.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|If you want a good look at the financial community's contribution to the collapse of the housing and financial markets, this is a good place to start.  Warning: much foul language/vulgarity, but it does provide an unvarnished look at the result of unbridled greed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have Minecraft on my iPod, Kindle Fire HD, and PC. The PE needs some more updates from version 0.7.5, but it is much like the PC Version, excluding the Nether not being present. In the near updates, they do plan thought to make Minecraft Pocket Edition the PC Version. Definitely worth the price of $6:99.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a brilliantly written novel deserving of far more than five stars. It's a book you'll want to keep, think about and read again. I found that whenever I closed the book, the story  stayed with me until I opened it again. I tried not to read it too fast because I didn't want the book to end, but sadly I finished it in two days.<br /><br />This book not only transported me into each character's head, it had me also living their life. I became each character as they took turns coming to life for me. Liane Moriarty depicts raw emotion so explicitly that there were times when I couldn't differentiate my emotional pain from the characters'.<br /><br />The author drove home the fact, sobering as it is, that everything we do or ignore to do affects other people, just like the old pebble hitting the water rippling effect theory.<br /><br />In this poignant story, Liane Moriarty highlights three  families who were struck by disaster like a sucker punch. Moriarty unveils for the reader just how a little selfish secret, a deception, a lie can crumble lives like a set of falling dominos.<br /><br />Tess O'Leary's mundane life came to a halting end when the two people she had loved most in the world betrayed her.<br />Rachel Crowley mourns daily for her deceased daughter and can't for the life of her figure out how she is still living, since  heart was broken twenty-eight years ago.<br />Cecilia Fitzpatrick was a successful business woman until she discovered a life changing hidden letter written by her husband.<br /><br /> What else can I say about Liane Moriarty's writing, other than it stands by itself; shining with magnificence? Oh yes, it's funny; very, very funny. \\"How could it be?\\" You ask. It's funny because it's about life, and  life is joyful, tragic and yes, even funny. There is nothing phony or unrealistic about Liane Moriarty's writing. Each page is filled with realistic characters experiencing life, with all its agonizing as well as its joyful moments.<br /><br /> I highly recommend reading this book. You will not be disappointed. I've already downloaded another one of Liane Moriarty's books. Wow, what a gem of an author to find.br /> I highly recommend reading this book. You will not be disappointed.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. Great way to pass the time.  The kids and wife also love it too. The monster truck is the way to go.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great app. Is it 20 work yet? I got the pro version free on free amazon app of the day.  That was cool.  Thanks for the great product.
B005HP2J66|2.0|My wife and I were disappointed, we had expected more, particularly after we had seen the book on the caves about a decade ago. JT
1781162646|3.0|This one just didn't seem as interesting as most but still okay. It is still worth reading that is for sure.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love this game! it is so much fun to play. I totally recomend this wonderfully fun game to everyone.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|Nothing at all like the book, which makes sense because if you've read the book? You'll know there's no way one could make a movie out of it. The most disappointing aspect are the zombies. Being a PG-13 movie, the zombies are nearly deprived of all gore and blood; instead they make happy chipmunk noises when their teeth snap open and shut. A lot of the movie is just Brad Pitt going from one zombie infested area to another in search of clues, all while escaping certain death.<br /><br />2004's 'Dawn of The Dead' and 2002's '28 Days Later' did this type of zombie movie much better and you'd be better served by watching those flicks again over this sterilized for mass consumption package of clich&eacute;d zombie tropes.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The tasks are varied enough to keep it interesting and it can be challenging at times without being frustratingly so. My favorite g5 game so far.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed the programs.  Friends told me how good the program was.  That's why I boght it.  Worth every penny.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a fantastic thriller!  I can't wait to read more works by this fantastic author.  I highly recommend it
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's album is a unique blend of modern techno music and classic violin. It may seem difficult to create multiple pieces using only one instrument and minimal vocals, she has created a creative palette of color and originality.
0811876373|5.0|Ordered a used book and it looks like new. Love the recipes, they are so cute.  Better than those cake pop machines.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I have just begun to watch this series.  No doubt people have compared and will always compare this to The Sopranos, and rightly so.  This show would never have been green-lighted  without the previous wild success of The Sopranos.  But, to be fair, this show has its own premise, its own arc, and its own appeal.  The cast are particularly well chosen, and the writing is superb.  As with so many TV dramas which resonate, the music contributes greatly to the emotional impact.  Excellent television in every respect, it is very much an adult show, in the best sense of that phrase.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Wonderful to finally own the entire &#34;Fawlty Towers&#34; series.  Just a shame they didn't do more!  Shipping was a bit slow, but product is fine.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This Reacher story is one wild ride. From the opening pages to the end, it held my attention. I enjoyed the team work in this one. This is the second novel I've read with Some of Reacher's army buddies and it makes the story even more interesting!
0345505387|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Outlander books and love the characters.  I'm not really a fan of graphic type books, but I thought that it would be interesting to see how Diana Gabaldon pictured Jaime and Claire and the other characters.  After reading the books you have a very clear detailed picture in your head of what these people look like. After reading a few pages of this book, I thought the drawings were way off base from how the characters were described in the books.  I thought they all looked almost indistinguishable from one another and they all seemed to have a very Asian appearance.  Then I read the bio of the artist and I said no wonder they looked Asian!  I also thought that if you didn't read &#34;Outlander&#34; first, this graphic book would make no sense.  Many times there are no segues between scenes and it only covers about the first half of the book and then it just stops; there is no real ending. I thought this effort was the nadir of Gabaldon's capabilities.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|The Dead had just been in Europe for a 20 show trip, and now they were touring up the West Coast. This concert has been of mythical proportions for a lot of reasons. I'm glad the Dead decided to release this one to everyone and not just to Dead.net. The quality of this show is like uncanny, I just listened to the first 2 CDs and the quality of the music is even as good as something like Europe 72, but without the overdubs. It's 3 CDs and a DVD to watch. It's in Eugene ,Oregon in late August and it is like 107, so a lot of folk are walking around sans clothes. But you would not know it listening to the Dead. A great set list too.<br /><br />  The songs on HDCD sounded great, very good quality. If you want the full DVD set, get the Deluxe set. The DVD has 8 songs ,Promised land, China Cat/Know you Rider,Jack Straw,Bird Song,Dark Star,Sing Me Back Home, and Greatest Story Ever Told.<br /><br />  Garcia sounds as good as I have ever heard him, He just seems to have his strat plugged into an Amp. Not a lot of effects, Garcia was playing with the band really together, the vocals are really great. I had seen the film on youtube before and knew it was good. They really made the CDs sound great, it was a 16 track recording, not 2 track like most of their releases. I thought the movie was going to be longer, They really did a lot of improving in the film, the colors are much better, wanted to see them play more songs, but fortunately, The CDs all sound great. The Dead did a lot of work improving the sound quality on the CDs, great mixing and mastering. On the film, wish the cameras had stayed on the Band more and less on the totally nude people, but you can't change that now. Probably the best version of Bertha that I ever heard. Also, China Cat/Know You Rider was like a perfect version. The vocals were great. I'm glad that I got this cheaper version, the best thing for me was the CDs, they sound great.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I have played the first one and the second met my expectations with a couple dead pigs and soaring birds
B00C5R8364|4.0|Enjoyed very much. Was a little confusing couldn't keep bad guys straight.<br />Good pastime fiction, great for vacation, or rainy day
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinning and browsing on Pinterest but I have intermittent problems with the app on Kindle Fire.  I still use Pinterest regularly but not without minor glitches in the app.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|did not work in my kindle. I have it on my ipad and I love the game. update it and I will download it again
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|This book is attempting to modernize &#34;positive attitude&#34;, etc by including the newer concept that the universe space (between the stars, etc) is not empty. But it has too many quotes, too many contradictions, ... It's an intriguing idea, but it's left hanging.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it! Can't wait for new season to start. The characters are so believable. I wish there were more shows like this.
0525478817|5.0|Books do not often bring tears to my eyes.  I have only ever shed tears for one other book in my reading career, and there weren't many tears.  The Fault in Our Stars caused me to cry like a freakin' baby in parts.  This book emitted such emotion through its wonderfully scripted words.  I listened to the audiobook version and am very torn as to whether this was a good decision or not.  I loved the audio track.  I thought that the narrator, Kate Rudd, did a fantastic job with bringing the story to life.  I do not regret listening to the audiobook whatsoever, but a part of me really wants to pick up the actual written word of the book and actually read it.  It was that good that I feel like I need to actually see and read the beautiful words.  I will read it someday.  How can I not?  It makes me sad that I will not have \\"A Peek Inside\\" for this book (because it's just too hard with audiobooks to get an exact quote), because there are so many beautiful and wonderfully crafted quotes from this book.  I guess you'll just have to trust me (and everyone else) and just read it and find the quotes for yourself.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is about a sixteen-year-old girl, Hazel Grace, who has cancer.  Terminal cancer.  She will die.  The reader is taken on part of her journey as she develops relationships with other kids with cancer, struggles with the emotional and physical side effects of cancer, and just tries to live every day life as best she can under the circumstances.  This boy she meets and ultimately falls in love with, Augustus Waters, is a fantastic character.  I love him and I love Hazel.  They are both amazing, as with all of the characters in this novel.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to describe what a great book this is, with its beautiful writing, which includes a lot of sarcasm and humour along the way.  This is my first experience with a John Green novel and he has made me a huge fan.  All it took was this one book.  I cannot wait to read more of his books and I highly recommend that you give his words a try as well.  You won't regret it.s books and I highly recommend that you give his words a try as well.  You won't regret it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|keeps my phone and the 4 tablets we have around the house clean and clears any cache or unneeded space! i love this app it is always the first one i download on any of my devices
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I don't care for zombies -- they lack personality and sex-appeal.  But this movie makes up for it.  It's such a great take on Romeo and Juliette and has so much humor.  The zombies are more than mindless killing and eating machines.  Very well written and acted!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I still love this game. I have been playing solitude since I was a kid. Played many versions, this version is still addictive.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|I HEARD ABOUT THIS MOVIE BUT NEVER WATCHED UNTIL NOW AND WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.... IT IS FUNNY, SAD AND MOVING, TO SE  HOW THE FATHER PRETENDS TO BE PLYING TO SAVE HIS SON FROM THE SADNESS AROUND THEM<br />  I MAY WATCH IT AGAIN.....
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fast<br /> pace game that me and my whole family enjoy playing. We are hoping that you create another game like this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lovely show. Beauty scenery & dimensional characters make this my favourite show. Can't wait for season 4!!  Truly a must see.
B001EN71CW|5.0|...because it ends so abruptly.  What's the point of another review by some peanut among thousands of peanuts. This series is great, the blu-ray is great, and it's perhaps the greatest sin in the world that the series ended so soon.  It's a truly character driven drama, and EACH one of them is interesting and fun.<br /><br />Joss!  Please finish this show before Nathan Fillion looks too old!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Fantastic. Couldn't wait. Walking dead proves to be much more than just a tv series. Great writing, great acting, great atmosphere.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I fell in love with the Firefly series a ways back when my friend introduced it to me.  It's basically a live version of the classic anime Cowboy Bebop.  The season was woefully cancelled after a mere 14 episodes.  There was an outcry from the world, and thus this movie was born.  They manage to use all of the original caste in this movie, and they are themselves as they left off in the series.<br /><br />Would I like this movie if I wasn't into the series?  I'm not sure I would.  I don't think I'd get it, and I don't think I'd care about the characters quite as much.  This was made to please an already established fan base.  They skillfully answered a bunch of questions that had been left unanswered about the back story of the Firefly universe.  It was perhaps slightly rushed, but hey, there was initially supposed to be several more episodes to flesh it all out.<br /><br />River kicking butt is hands down the most crowd-pleasing aspect of this movie.  Overall, an excellent movie if you're already a fan of the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Much better than trying to use the full page profile online on my Kindle. The pages wouldn't load all the way. Using this app works perfectly. I'm addicted to Pinterest!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Need to add more apps.  I can get youtube and Netflix on game consoles and blue-ray DVD.  Guess I was expecting more access.  Using device with my iPad<br /><br />December 25, 2013 UPDATE!!! - with the addition of the new apps (including Hulu, hBO GO, Pandora, etc)  I am now thoroughly enjoying my Google ChromeCast HDMI Streaming Media Player!  A must-have!
B00CP4GSGO|5.0|Forget about Williams' old and worn-out and action-comic tune.<br />This is the real Superman's musical spirit. Fresh savage beauty, dynamic strings, beautiful and mystical melodies.<br />There's some thin connection with Inception and The Dark Knight but this can be possibly best Zimmer soundtrack ever and Zimmer is best living film composer for sure!<br />Besides this sleeve folder is magnificent and download of mp3 expanded version worked perfectly.
1452126577|5.0|this is the funniest book ever. grumpy cat says what we all think, but are afraid to say.<br />i bought this book for my best friends birthday. i had one and she just loved it,soooooooooooo had to get her one.
1781162646|5.0|Just your typical nice book from a legend. King makes this a fun read which was great for the summer. Very easy to read and enjoyable.
1608871452|5.0|This is a stunning paratext, one that both explores and expands the world and mythology of Supernatural while at the same time providing a great deal of behind the scenes perspective. Those two trajectories may seem contradictory, but if you're a person in firm grasp of reality and are aware it's all a fiction, it works, mainly because it's the kind of show that leaves you wanting more--more of anything, any scrap--and this book delivers on two fronts. It's beautifully designed, overlarge and full of glossy photos and interviews with cast and crew, and it goes further by including a good deal of ephemera--some collectible type stuff, glossy cardstock pictures of the cast, a sheet of stickers featuring various symbols used in the show--but some is more strictly paratextual, such as postcards from the crummy motels the boys frequent, a guide to hunting demons, a sealed pouch of documents (that I haven't actually opened yet), even a pine-scented air freshener in its package, inserted into the section about the Impala. It's a feast for any Supernatural fan, worthy of a place of honor on any coffee table, except that if you put it there, other people might try to put their grubby mitts all over it...
B003TTH5MA|5.0|Love and miss this show! The acting is great!  Being a housewife myself I find the series very relatable, but in a more dramatic fashion of course!
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|Bought this used, disc was clean and so was the box. save a dollar or two. same features as the dvd so i gave that copy away.

1609611543|5.0|I am almost at the end reading this book.  It is  a good book to read for persons that are bothered by wheat products.  It<br /> tells you alternatives to wheat, how wheat is planted to-day, it tells us that this wheat to-day is not the same as the one<br /> our grandmothers used to make bread etc.  For me personally, has made a difference in my thinking about food, it is a<br />matter of what someone believes  whatever they read.<br />I speak for myself, as I  was willing to try alternatives to wheat, and have discovered a whole new array of wheat free foods.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to teens and adults who like this type of genre. The heroine and the troubled hero are so likeable. You root for them. Loved this book! Addictive.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|My kids didn't like this as much as Kiki's delivery service or Totoro.  I still think it is better than most disney films.  No focus on sexuality, more innocent themes compared to disney animation films.
B000089RVR|5.0|soft, mellow sound.  good for a peaceful ride in the car, or just having some quiet time for your self
B002SF9YNO|5.0|The cello music at the beginning of the movie alone makes the movie enjoyable.  However, the story is very touching and unusual.<br />The ceremony  or ritual of those who address the deceased seems much closer and tenderer than what the western world is accustomed to.  It seemed to give the living  greater freedom of release from pent up sorrow of transgressions or just the feelings of loss.  The loving care addressed to the body was a tender testimony to life. I am glad that I own this video.  I have already viewed it twice.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Stevie nicks is a sound that seems to appeal to all.  Although it doesn't include other favs, it is simply a great collection.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is genius. Not only is the show well-written, but it makes you think, and I swear I feel smarter just watching this. The way he analyzes things and how we get to see how his mind works is remarkable. But back to the well-written part. The characterization is amazing. In many versions, Watson is simply a side kick. Not here. Here, he is an equal partner and a tough former soldier who knows how to use a gun and will if necessary. He also has a good amount of emotional depth. He is traumatized by the war and longing for adventure and danger, and is thus drawn to the danger surrounding Sherlock. Molly is a intelligent and shy character you can't help but love. I can't say everything I like about this show well enough, but, essentially, Sherlock is a show that will suck you in a will have you thirsting for more. You have been warned.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Discovered KD Lang 20+ years ago.  Her voice and style is hauntingly beautiful.  She will always be one of my favorites.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Fabulous season. Can't wait for season 11. Love this show. A little sad that Ziva is leaving the show, can't wait to see who joins.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I bought this at the same time I bought the Kindle.  Now that I have seen other cases, I wish that I had waited.  This case is a well-made case that offers the necessary protection.  But since then, I have seen other cases which fold back and so become a stand for the Kindle.  This is good when flying in a plane because it can be set up on the tray table and played or read.

Apparently she's a scientist because we are having a lot of fun doing the exercises and the results are amazing!  I recommend this for everyone. The writing is like a fun conversation you would have with a wise best friend; casual, comfortable, and very funny!
0399255370|5.0|I read this to my sons 1st grade class today and they  loved it! And adults find it just as humorous! Encourages creativity and thinking outside the box.<br /><br />Someone gave this book a so-so review because they felt this book was gender stereotyping with the color pink, I can also be hypersensitive to gender stereotyping so took a look at the page and I have to say it is not a big deal at all.<br /><br />Buy it, enjoy it! It's a good book to have.

Brad Pitt.<br /><br />Rated R. dead people, some gore, dark theme, no nudity, no curse words I can remember?<br /><br />One of the best movies of the year. one of the best of this genre. well produced, well acted, great effects, great story!<br /><br />I recommend It!

B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Well this is music at the top that dont exsist anymore just listen and enjoy and hope that the kids today learn how to ply and sing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Well this thing has been covered to death on the trade sites so I'll just hit the highlights.<br />If you need a media streamer this is a great one at a great price and it's only going to get better as more stuff is developed for it. It powers easily through an outlet with the included power adapter or you can power it from the TV with the included USB cable. It plugs directly into an HDMI port and it comes with a cord that lets it hang if you are in a tight spot. It is fairly small when compared to the competition and lastly it sets up in about a minute.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I found this novel to be one of the most interesting one to read.  The author's incredible historical research was the most interesting to me.  I did not know that immigrant orphans were sent by train to Midwest areas to basely for many to become indentured servants.  I found the relationship between the 91 year old and the 17yr old one to be exceptional, especially how the author treated the stories of each.  This is a must read.
B000SOSS5W|5.0|I've viewed this and found it very entertaining.  The music was great, and the movie provides a very good glimpse into the lives of jazz artist from that era, especially when you put it in perspective when viewing actual historic jazz documentaries.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a history book, not a book that promotes Jesus as a manifestation of God on earth. Jesus is presented as a disciple of John the Baptist who goes out on his own and gathers His own disciples. He is a man of violence and a man who wants the Romans out of Israel. If you are not secure in your heart as to what you believe about Jesus you should not read this book. It is a history of the middle east in the time of Jesus (before His life and after it). It is a best seller because the author is a great writer and because he is an accomplished scholar who used many hundreds of scholarly research papers to write his book. He is a man whose mind somehow was able to actually feel that he was living in these ancient times and he does the same for the reader. It is to be recommended to those who want to go beyond the history that can be gleamed from reading the Old and New Testaments. It will not create a spiritual thing in your life but it will entertain you with solid history lessons from these ancient times.
140006922X|2.0|History with a bias?  The book did not bring much, beyond making Jesus just another zealot, a  simple disciple of John the baptist. I had hoped that all the new research would have brought some new reality to the life of Jesus, it did not.  The historical background, however was interesting.
B007SGM084|5.0|Mere words cannot express the LOVE I feel for the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. This trilogy is more than just about sex.  Yes, sex is a big part but it's more about the love between two people.  Christian has many issues from his childhood and he's so guarded and closed off but once he meets Anastasia she opens his heart to so many beautiful emotions.  She helps him to feel unconditional love.  There are trials and tribulations in all three of the books, yes alot of sex but also so much emotion.  I cannot get enough of this trilogy.  I am on the edge of my seat with the turn of each page.  I am so emotionally invested in Christian and Anastasia and their love story. I was unsure when I got this set for a present because all everyone talks about is the sex/dom/sub scenes. But, once I started to read the first book I understood where the author was leading me in the story.  Again, the sex is only a 1/4 of the story.  If you are looking for a true romantic story this is it.  It's all about LOVE.  To anyone who reads this review don't hesitate to purchase this trilogy.  I can promise you that you will not regret it.
0380730405|4.0|Good old-fashioned classic.  Then look at the Hitchcock version of the story, free on U tube. Excellent depiction of the characters.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'm not a doctor or a nutritionist, but reading this book is a real eye-opener! I was recommended to read it from my doctor<br />who said that this may help me with my health issues. Maybe this &#34;will&#34; be the answer, tiime will tell.  I tell everyone I know that they should read this book!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I have had this for almost a year now I believe and it has gone everywhere with me since then. Used an old Micro-SD card to make it into a USB drive for school and other business. It's always on my keys and have yet to run into a problem. The card has remained tight and accessible anytime.
B009D8RJR2|5.0|This is another winner.  Really good read. Keep them coming. I can't get enough. I am hooked on these really great books.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|It bugged me reading the the book looking for my favorite character's that never should up. just an apology at the end. would have been more enjoyable to if the book would have been split
B0020BUWX2|5.0|The character shows really emotions that you can actually feel yourself as your reading the book, and you feel the pain that she's feeling on how to decide what is right
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great viewing..I'm hooked.  I nice combination of humour and sorrow with a realistic story and some great actors.  Simply can't stop watching.
B005HNG1S0|3.0|All power to this fiery Frenchwoman for refusing to record Mozart with Count Claudio Abbado the Impaler - the bloodletting has to stop somewhere - but that does not make her listenable in her own right in a hotly contested field where the likes of Anda (K 459) and Uchida (K 488 with Tate) are sovereign.<br /><br />First I question the wisdom of performing these two masterpieces with an orchestra which is barely larger than a glorified string quartet. For instance, it is a little known fact that K 459 is missing its timpani and trumpets parts which would have intensified its pomp and circumstance. Even in their absence, the score still predicates more grunt than what's on offer here. And speaking of the orchestra, where's the distinction in the opening prelude of K 488, the contrapuntal finale of K 459 and the conducting thereof? It's inaudible to me. Surely Count Hugo Wankle and the Dixieland Funktime Band would have been cheaper to hire if this is the requisite standard.<br /><br />Second, while I enjoy Grimaud's joie de vivre, it strikes me as being somewhat two dimensional if not brainless. Mozart encompasses far more than mere sunlight. For instance, Grimaud shadow-boxes with the darkness in the F Sharp Minor Adagio of K 488 and no more. Others have better crystalised the nocturnal peace of K 459's Allegretto: a trip to Palmer's Tower this ain't.<br /><br />K 505 is well done but in itself, it's not going to save the day.<br /><br />To those who awarded five stars to this disc, I pose the question: where is the subsequent clamour for HG to record more of the Concertos or the Sonatas?<br /><br />This is nicely done, entertaining and no more. Do better!

B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I knew it had good actors and I'd heard some good comments but wasn't entirely sold...I mean...you know...another zombie movie.  Hubby and I gave it a try and really enjoyed the film.  Romance, action, original story line and good acting.  Definitely recommend.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A great story including love, drama, and action with detailed characters. This book is a must have for your collection.

B002PEP4SC|3.0|If you love the Castle series, you'll love this book.  If not, don't bother.<br /><br />It's light, enjoyable reading, with a decent plot, but it's never going to rival Agatha Christie, Harlan Coben, or Dennis Lehane.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're looking for a nice beach or airplane book, this fits the need.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Very sweet story line, easy to follow, maintains children's attention throughout the movie. Adults enjoyed the movie as well as the kids.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Enjoy the characters and the premise. On the other hand some of the story line are over the top. Still enjoyable.
B007NU54H4|5.0|Simple storyline. Not too scary for 4 year old. Not too complicated of a story, keeps their attention. Would recommend to others.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|Filming almost entirely with green screens doesn't make for overly convincing acting but it does open the door to an awesome visual feast! The film is so fun to watch, its drawbacks become minor issues in an overall entertaining experience. If you have any sort of affinity for the black/white interpretations of the future from the golden age of sci-fi, you'll want to own this one.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I love the history of the English monarchy so, in that respect, this series is great and seems to get a lot of the story and timeline correct in accordance to Henry VII and his reign. It is very captivating and keeps you coming back for more quite frequently. The reason that I did not rate this as a five star series is its sexual vulgarity. I understand at this is part of a drama series but it is a bit much for my liking. Overall, it's a great series and I will be continuing on with the next season. Grateful this comes with the Amazon Prime membership.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This book was recommended to me as a read before turned into a movie.. I have to say I cannot picture the movie being as good as the book. The main character struggles with her tremendous losses versus what she has left. She has to make a profound decision. I feel almost anyone can relate to this book in some way.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Everyone will laugh with this children's comedy. The minions have less of a part in this one but are still funny. The plot is easy to follow for the little ones and the ending lends itself to a sequel of course. Overall great movie.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Loved this book. Self doubt in Love happens to everyone.  It is great to follow these characters  as they move on with life and adapt through  their losses.This is a great read.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I loved the series growing up and now my kids are enjoying them too. The Blu-ray out matches the original format and rivals even the big screen. I hope they make another movie in the future.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This came highly recommended by friends. In The first work out phase I was sweating but not drenched. You can definitely rev up the intensity and make it as tough as you want.  I havent done the phases 2-3 yet. I've been doing P90X but needed a shorter workout on the days I could not fit in an hour. So far I like it and would recommend this produxt

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|What a surprise! Hail to the King is an album you can play from start to finish without getting bored. It resembles the amazing sound quality from Metallica's \\"Black Album.\\" It's obvious Avenged Sevenfold stripped down the music, added a lot of groove and simple, heavy guitar riffs. \\"Doing Time,\\" is heavily influence by Gun's and Roses and \\"This is War,\\" sounds a lot like Metallica's \\"Sad But True.\\" However the pre-chorus/chorus in \\"This is War,\\" is extremely EPIC! M. Shadows' voice has grown tremendously throughout the years. I personally haven't owned an Avenged Sevenfold record since \\"City of Evil\\" and at the time I was greatly disappointed by the album. So for me this is their comeback record!<br /><br />It's important for bands to evolve with their sound and talents. Their next album needs to be different from \\"Hail to the King.\\" The production value of this record is extremely high and fits this album and this album alone, perfectly. This is how \\"Hail to the King\\" will stand out from the crowd and (in my opinion) be the one to beat!<br /><br />Reasons to buy: Simply heavy guitar riffs, SOUND QUALITY, song structures, great vocals.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is game is so awesome that I could play it all night and during the school year and may be all my life.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I love the bonus features and have learned so much more of the back story of the show. The commentary from the actors gives you insight to many bits of information you may have overlooked during the original viewing of the show.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This show is absolutely spellbinding and addictive.  The acting is incredible!  This show is truly for adults and for the faint of heart.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|First off, I did not find this book as absorbing as the previous two in the trilogy. It isn't as dramatically compelling. It is, however, somewhat more contemplative and also shows quite a bit more humor, above all in the interactions between the surviving humans and the Crakers. While the first two books are samequels (taking part in essentially the same time frame, but from different perspectives, and ending at pretty much the same moment) Maddaddam is somewhat like the Godfather II in that it moves the narrative forward into the future at the same time that it expands knowledge of events previous to the primary narrative in the other two books. In many ways it's laudable of Atwood to wind up the trilogy this way; even if this book lacks the sizzle of the previous ones, it does provide more opportunity to reflect upon the meaning of those events in relation to who we are as a species. Certainly a must read for those who've read the other two books, and probably (like me) have been anxiously anticipating the final volume. If you haven't read the previous novels, better to start there.
034580709X|5.0|THE BAT is the riveting debut of the Norwegian author Jo Nesbo's Inspector Harry Hole series; a first novel that truly made an impression.  But it has only recently been translated from the Norwegian by Don Bartlett, and made available to English speaking readers.  This crime novel was published in Norway in 1997; it won the Glass Key Award for best Nordic crime novel (an accolade shared with Peter Høeg, Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson).<br /><br />For whatever his reasons, its prize-winning author apparently decided to up the ante by choosing to set his first thriller in antipodean Australia, rather than his home country.  Inspector Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad has been sent to Sydney.  He is simply to observe a murder case: the brilliant, but difficult and alcoholic Harry may offer the Australian police his assistance, but he is to stay out of trouble, and out of their way. The victim in the case he has been sent down under on is Inger Holter, a twenty-three year old Norwegian blond who at one time was a minor celebrity back home: she may also have been raped, but the conditions in which she was found make it impossible to say definitively. However, the Inspector gets friendly with one of the case's lead detectives and one of its witnesses and is drawn deeper into it.  Eventually, the cops realize that Inger's death is only the latest in a string of unsolved rapes and murders all over the huge country.<br /><br />The book is exciting from beginning to end, pulling the reader in and never letting go.  Until he finally cracks the case, Hole offers up a series of elegant theories; events prove each of them faulty.  But the detective's work is outstanding.  Also outstanding is the author's work, his treatment of Australia; he must have spent a great deal of time there and done a great deal of research.  He has the country, its weather, unusual fauna and flora, topography, history, social history and social ways down on the page; also the sad and contentious history, social ways and beliefs of its Aboriginal natives.<br /><br />Nesbo, a musician, economist and author, has been another, strong candidate for the attention of readers left bereft by the untimely death of that phenomenally successful Swedish author, [[ASIN:B007C52NY2 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Series Set: (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) (The Girl Who Played with Fire) (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest) (Millennium Trilogy)]].  Mind you,  I actually was reading Scandinavian crime fiction long ago, going back to Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo's Martin Beck, [[ASIN:B000O6WZNU The Laughing Policeman]]; and I don't see that any of the other current candidates can touch Nesbo's work for its immediacy, fast pace,  level of inventiveness and imagination.  I've previously read and reviewed in these pages the writer's [[ASIN:0061133981 The Devil's Star]], [[ASIN:0307743187 The Leopard]], [[ASIN:0307951154 Phantom]], [[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman ]] and [[ASIN:0307595854 The Redeemer]].

1781162646|5.0|I was excited to see a new Stephen King book that didn't weigh ten pounds. I've always kept up to date with his stories since my first book in the early 70's which was of course, THE SHINING. And then a friend handed me SALEM'S LOT.  Can I say I was totally hooked? The only ones I didn't care for were the DARK TOWER series.<br />This crime novel harkens back to the days of Mickey Spillane. I used to love those crime paperbacks. They were so much more entertaining than the \\"Bodice Ripper\\" Harlequin Romance books my friends were all reading. Let me just say Mr. King rescued  me from the doldrums of those mass produced \\"novels\\" that if you went to the exact middle page the heroine was finally enjoying the hero. I had stumbled (literally) onto a paper grocery bag of these paperbacks and halfway through the stack was THE SHINING.  The book Gods must have been smiling that day. Once I started that truly amazing book, I could not stop until the very last drop of terror seeped into my veins and gave me nightmares for weeks, until I found the next King book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this light romp through the Amusement Park and having worked at a carnival one summer, I was reminded so much of those days throughout the book. True maybe some of the carny speak was contrived but as SK put it, it's called fiction. I would much rather read a sprinkling of carnival talk than to try to learn a whole new language to understand a book. That's why I don't care much for Sci-Fi in general.<br /><br />This story hooks you in from the start and makes you wish you could go there. After all, what's more terrifying than a haunted house ride with its own ghost. And trying to figure out who the killer was , lets just say I didn't expect the outcome.<br /><br />Read this in a couple of nights. Great being able to finish it that fast. Now I simply must check out some of the other books in this series.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love that I can play this on r off line! Love I can change the backgrounds and decks like I can on my regular computer!!

1611761565|5.0|The book \\"No Easy Day\\" by Mark Owen is an amazing read if you wanna know the US Navy SEALs better and get to know more details into `the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden'.<br /><br />While the author has been very careful and has gone great lengths (even hiring a Navy attorney to review the manuscript and be sure) to ensure that none of the information shared in the book is classified and none of the incidents and personalities described are traceable to real persons - SEALs or otherwise - it is still is a great compendium of publicly available information and a great first person account of the SEAL experience.<br /><br />The first half of the book is pretty much about the SEAL training and the tough disciplined life in general. Most of the deployments that the author has been involved in the last 10 years are in Iraq and Afghanistan; details about these, and some unique experiences, are available. The second half of the book is a detailed description of the UBM (CIA-speak for Osama Bin Laden) killing mission and starts with the selection of SEALs for the mission, their mission-specific intensive no-end training, travel to Bagram and then on to Jalalabad and the eventual assault into the now famous Abbottabad compound.<br /><br />Having read the book with great interest there are a couple of things that will stay with me for good:<br />- Like military men of most countries, there is no end to the passion and commitment of the SEALs to server their country as long as they are in active service, notwithstanding the difference of opinion with the senate. Also, the government will ensure they have all they need, and more, to stay committed and in peak performance<br />- The government, after the initial heat of the period of war has passed, does go to great lengths making it difficult for military-men to do real work. The author mentions, and I quote - at one point it appeared that they were fighting war with one hand and filling forms with the other. Have you beenabused? -  is the standard question asked to any captured person and an affirmative response would result in investigations (and that was often since the Taliban and Al Quaida soldiers soon learnt this survival trick).<br />- The detailed UBL mission, the landing in Abottabad compound and the helicopter crash, the cleaning-up of the building from ground up, the killing and the wives and kids around, and how the SEALs ensured that it was indeed him before announcing Geronimo EKIA!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I reviewed this Scanner in talking about the replacement holders. Hope that isn't confusing. I have found it helpful to have the backup holders and they should be ordered at the same time as the scanner, to make sure you don't get interrupted if the basic negative holder gets scratched or jammed.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Nice story, interesting story line. I enjoyed the characters and the story line. If you like romance stories with a tidy ending, then defenitly pick this one.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|If yo have not gotten into the hype, you should.  I have enjoyed a lot of these types of shows where you find yourself rooting for the bad guy.  Great acting and premise for the series
B005P1YCNK|5.0|A podcasting friend recommended this book to me and I really enjoyed it! It is motivational and gets you prepared to change bad habits and pivot in the right direction to reach your goals. The little things add up over time, and I'm looking forward to continuing my path ahead. Thanks Darren!

B00471JSR4|4.0|yes GI Joe Rise of Cobra  exceeded my  expectations  first of all delivery was early awesome. movie Is really good  really darn good if I might add.  the cast was great  Dennis Quaid and Brendan Fraser a great addition to the movie. oh yeah one more thing  adding GI Joe retaliation  will not be a waste of your money  it is actually better.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Charles Dickens would truly be a writer that I would faint to meet.  He combines so much character and description of olden days that I truly feel transported in time and  the more I read some v of these occurrences depicted, the more accustomed I become to the era; becoming less shocked and abhorred with the manner of life. Each book is an example of intellect that I find more wholesome than any other writer of today's period.  I do love current authors but am totally swept off my feet by Mr. Dickens.
0345535421|5.0|This was a gift for my son as for the other four in this series. He is pleased and says there s great read.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved all the life stories woven into each. Character. I liked this as much as The Kite Runner.  Not as brutal.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Really great conclusion to an amazing trilogy. Atwood is a goddess of literature.<br /><br />Ten years after the release of the first book in the Maddaddam trilogy (Oryx and Crake) and four years after the release of the second book in the trilogy (Year of the Flood), Margaret Atwood releases the final book in her apocalyptic/post-apocalypse series - Maddaddam. When Atwood first released Oryx and Crake, the post-apocalypse wasn't as fun and romanticized as it is right now - hard to imagine I know but ....: the Walking Dead was not yet on TV, Red Dawn had not yet been remade, and main stream romance publishing houses weren't regularly releasing post-apocalypse romance themed books. I think it is fair to say that in 2003, the apocalypse was not yet the rage. It is interesting that when the series ends, Maddaddam finds itself nestled on bookshelves next to other mainstream and best sellers that deal with the what-happens-when-society-collapses. Atwood is a visionary. But Maddaddam and the trilogy is not just about the collapse of society, it is about so much more.<br /><br />Each book in the trilogy is told form a different point of view and at a different point in time, yet it is the same story and the same characters. The entire story is told in the present, but it is done with memory and flashbacks of the characters. Each book is about the time before the collapse of the world's society and each book is also about the time after the societal collapse.<br /><br />There are no zombies, no aliens, no floods and the moon didn't fall out of the sky. Instead Atwood's book (and series) is really a critique of what she sees as a major movement in our culture and our world - corporate control and dominance. Can you imagine a world where the corporations call the shots? Where the governments are so weakened that the corporations are the ones truly running things? What if the motivation to earn profit by those at the top of the corporation is what ruled the world? And these corporations controlled all scientific endeavors and the production of all food? Hmmmmmm ..... These are the topics explored by the Maddaddam trilogy and Atwood does this with really well developed characters, an amazingly intricately built (but believable) future world.  Atwood began writing about this topic in the early 2000s.  She is such a visionary (yes I have written that word twice now in this review -- but remember her book The Handmaid's Tale?, yeah she is brilliant).<br /><br />But it is also about relationships with our fathers and mothers. It is about sexuality, desire and how gender roles are constructed. The series takes on concepts of the building of myth and religion. And it is also funny.<br /><br />\\"Rebecca's having a cup of what they've all agreed to call coffee.\\"<br /><br />But you know what it is not? The post-apocalypse is not fun and it is not romantic. In Atwood's imagined world, there is no coffee, there is no abundant supplies free for the taking and even with the majority of the population gone it is hard to find food. Empty buildings are dangerous as untended electrical wires and water pipes often mal-function causing fires and flooding. City centers can be filled with tainted water and structurally unsound buildings due to lack of human maintenance. Without family members around to support us and no hope for the future, motivation is hard to maintain:<br /><br />\\"Daytime becomes irrelevant.  You can get careless, you can overlook details, you can lose track.  These days she'll find herself upright, in the middle of the room, one sandal in her hand, wondering how she got there; or outside under a tree, watching the leaves riffle, then prodding herself:  Move. Move now. Get moving. You need to .... But what exactly is it that she needs to do?\\"<br /><br />I would categorize this series as both literary fiction and science fiction. Readers who enjoy Margaret Atwood books or readers who read science fiction/post-apocalypse books to think aboutbroader concepts beyond just the story would enjoy this trilogy. Fans of the first two books may be slightly disappointed by the beginning of Maddaddam, but stick with it. The story does start slow and has a different feel but it is very rewarding and addicting.broader concepts beyond just the story would enjoy this trilogy.

B00CHNKJFO|4.0|The graphics, game play, and interactions are great! The sound bytes from the movie are good as well. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the game intermittently stops and restarts for split seconds - due to processor/RAM I'm assuming. If ZEN can get that worked out, I'll give the game 5 stars. Dont let that slightly negative comment stop you from downloading the game. It is by far and away the best pinball game amazon has in the marketplace.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|recommended application for music lovers.... Easy to use, UI is good, downloads faster. Can rate it 5* if the option to get rid the advertisements are given at no extra $.
B001BC5HXG|1.0|Had always heard of this book and author.  Didn't appreciate the content or want to hear the author's feelings on matters of the world.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Not nearly as good as my B&W P-5'a yet surprisingly good for the $. Built well, comfortable and the sound exceeds my expectations. Great value.
B000002OMN|5.0|Most people seem to think that Meat Loaf peaked with his first album, Bat Out of Hell.  I disagree.  I beleive this is his masterpiece.  The songs and the \\"sound\\" are amazing.  This album is great from start to finish and is highly recommended -- crank it UP!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Just the right level to keep it interesting. Not too hard that you lose heart, and not too easy to find it boring. Free game and you'd be glad you got it if you like these sort of games.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I haven't been able to start another book after reading this because I'm still processing the story-line.  It's no Pulitzer prize winning novel but a good read to keep you entertained.  It's also relateable which I like because fantasy can be annoying when you're done.  I recommend this for a vacation, want to get lost for a bit, long plane/car ride read.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 7 yr old HAD to have this after her birthday when she got a huge stuffed pony. The game is colorful, bright, and has plenty of coins to earn and points to accrue. The problem comes when it is time to turn the game off or switch to another game. Finding the exit button is a challenge, even for an adult. Overall, not bad for the price.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have worked in the medical field most of my life and I really enjoy anytime I hear of a Doctor having God as an experience
B009AY04A8|5.0|I've played other Nevosoft hidden objects games and enjoyed all of them. They're all fun and challenging with a variety of mini-games and interesting plot (I don't think there's too much talking). Recommend!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellently written and definitely a story that needed to be told.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone in the sciences or medicine...it includes a good history of the development of medical ethics.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I use to love this app. Then they updated it and now it's like using a bad website from the 1990's. I went from using this app daily, giving it five stars, to using it rarely, giving it one star. This was a terrible update. I wish I could roll back to the old version. Some developer needs to get fired for this one. AccuWeather used to haabe the best weather app. Better than the ones made for ipad. Now, I keep looking for something to change to to get this app off my Kindle. Incredibly disappointed.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It adjusts from bright to dim throughout the spectrum. I'm just not sure how practical it is on my kindle for regular use.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a fun game with different choices easy to play wish could get more bingo coins easier but still fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Second time reading this book...and the second time is way better. This book has a great story line. VERY detailed.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Awesome movie! If a sequel should turn up, I'm very interested to see how they would play it out, as there would be some inconsistencies due to one of the main driving points of this one's plot.
B00B22ASUM|3.0|I really enjoyed reading how Bob the cat changed the authors life but it got a bit long towards the end.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone who loves the Rings trilogy and wants to be swept back to Middle Earth through its magnificent music!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Doesn't try to be too much...entertaining and clever. Reminder of my younger days...some episodes are outstanding, others are OK, but rarely a dud. Enjoy.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|I usually buy &#34;Prime&#34; only.  But I took a chance on this DVD because of the price.  The DVD arrived a lot sooner than promised and was &#34;like new&#34; just like it was advertised.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Best show ever. It is really good.  Cannot wait for season 4.  I already miss watching it. I cannot wait.
1577314808|5.0|If you read one book this year - make it this one.  I've never been a believer in the 'spiritual hocus pocus' and was pretty skeptical when I made the purchase, but I gave it a chance... and it has changed my life.<br /><br />Learning to live in the present is incredibly powerful in so many ways.  8 months after reading the book, several concepts have been incorporated into my daily life.  Every day I enjoy reduced stress/anxiety, improved focus and performance, enriched relationships, positive outlook, incredible happiness and gratitude.  Nothing in my life has significantly changed, just the way I control my thoughts and ego.  The book also helped me differentiate spirituality from religion, which has been more fulfilling than I expected as I haven't actively practiced religion as an adult.<br /><br />I could write a book on how much I like this book (clearly), but I'll get all 'deep thought' on you and hope you'll consider this: we have such a short time on this earth, would you be willing to give these concepts a chance for even the possibility that every single day could be more rewarding for the rest of your life?
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Bought this gaming mouse because I needed a high DPI mouse to keep up with the increase in speed I managed from lots of game time. I wasn't disappointed. The Anker delivered the DPI but I also really like the fact that its a big mouse for my big hands and the buttons are well placed. The only Con would be that not all the buttons are assigned as mouse buttons. Some only mimic keystrokes. As I use this mouse without a keyboard I'm not able to program all the buttons. There's 2 I can't use. But the added weights, ergonomics, crisp buttons and high DPI make this a great mouse for a lot less than many others I've purchased in the past. I highly recommend it for PC or Xbox gamers.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My daughter loved watching this and I felt comfortable letting her watch it! i like how even in a monster movie they kept it pretty safe for all ages
B007G5H2HQ|3.0|It was okay, the story line was boring but the kids love like it, they don't need a story as long as there is animation.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I love this game, its fun and I enjoy playing it while waiting at the doctor's office or on the bus
0744014956|5.0|Love the GTAV book being Hardback and has a lot of information, the book could include more gaming in detail
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought it as a work watch but I wear it all the time. If I don't have it on I tend to look at my empty wrist wondering what time it is.<br /><br />The only down side I can see to the watch is that the band may start to fray and will hold dirt. But bands are very easy to replace.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|a very good book as is the other 6 books still waiting on the 8th book which i expect to be the best so far
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I wont tell you much about it but the story is worth at least seeing it once. I would recommend my friends to watch it.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|See it almost every time I memorize it My husband just looks at like for real again  What can I say
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is great because i imagine that im a princess and its great for when you want to wear for a wedding

B0072OFOM6|5.0|me encantó la serie, muy buenos actores,. me encantan las películas con base histórica, muestra ue el ser humano se rebela ante la opresión
B000TGCR38|5.0|It was the movie I was looking for and enjoyed watching.  Very informative. I was very happy to purchase it,.
1476734941|4.0|Very good points, but hard to follow, without a strong will power.  Very good book to read though.  I recommend it.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I honestly can't rember the movie that well , but just sit down with your popcorn and a 6 pack a beer and you'll be just cool
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|For what it was, I think JJ Abrams did a great job with this movie.  Not disappointed.  Definitely worth being in your library next to the original movie from 2009.  Benedict Cumberbatch plays a great villain.  A lot of twists and turns to this one but you can guess on some of the outcome.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|Some of the episodes are very contrived and try too hard, while other episodes are assured and flow well. The lens flare gimmick is overused in the first five or so episodes and becomes incredibly distracting and annoying, but the gimmick is eventually dropped; thankfully. The first season is a mixed big, but stick with it. By season two the show finds its stride and really gets interesting.
B0086700CM|5.0|I haven't gotten very far into it yet, its been a challenge having to start over and trying to get just alittle bit further each time.
B0055V6EZE|1.0|Despite being a fan of &#34;House&#34; and listening occasionally to hear him play the piano on the series when it was on, this piano jazz cd was a total disappointment on all songs.  I do think I will try to hear the cd's before I buy one based on artists name.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|My 10 year old and I enjoy playing this game together.  It is a brain challenger - trying to figure out where all of the objects are hidden!!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Delightful!  Music is great!  Fun to watch regardless of the season.  Recommended highly to all who have a heart and love of Christmas.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Don't buy this app you will waste your money! I bought this for my son and he cant even play it. This games takes forever to load and when it finally does it freeze up. I have to power down just to get rid of the app. Wish I could get my money back!
B009DA74ES|5.0|Another great addition to the series - another Porsche! Deeper down the rabbit hole we go with Hank Moody and co.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|this is my favorite movie i will watch it everyday. i wish they would come with a part 2. please
B0009P5YXO|3.0|The pen ends don't snap into place tightly enough, so when you write with them you risk popping them off.  The seams between the plastic pieces are a bit uneven and the whole thing feels a bit cheap.<br /><br />Still... the novelty of holding a sonic screwdriver is pretty cool. :-)<br /><br />But for $30 this thing should be a better toy.  Right now it feels like it's in $10-$15 territory, quality-wise.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|beautiful local  etc  but the charachters  ..were totally  mismatched..who would die for faidsy ...she was  vacuous  boring not  even glamourous...  .. i love  Leonardo in everything  he does... but  there was  no excitement just nast rich  people taking advantage of their place in life...
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This game is so cool! Its really addicting and fun. The game itself is great and its got campaign and multiplayer. Its so awesome, just this game, you wont regret it!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as the other 2 books.  The ending is bad.  Too bad. Was hoping for a lot more.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This is my favorite FFDP album since their first, and that's not saying I didn't love the two in between.  I really like how they keep it hard and heavy while mixing in the power ballads from time to time.  Adding tracks and bonus tracks with guest metal singers really added to an already awesome album.  You'll hear Rob Halford (of course), Maria Brink, Max Cavalera, Jamey Jasta and even Tech N9ne on the album, the last of which is an oddball out but still is an enjoyable song.  In summary, if you are a fan of any of FFDP's previous albums I think that you will really enjoy this one as well. I believe they took it to the next level with this one and it won't disappoint.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|So, while recently binging on the SG various series, I decided to watch SG-A, and while I enjoyed<br />seeing the shows themselves, I was impressed at how well the material has held up since it's departure<br />from the airwaves...
0399226907|5.0|Simply adorable.  The book teaches the stages of life for a caterpillar, the days of the week,  different foods, what over eating causes - fat, and the final stage of becoming a butterfly.
0762451319|2.0|I ordered 2 of these.  One for myself and one for my daughter but I was really shocked that they were so small.  One box was crushed since they threw them in together with the heavy boxed hardcover set of all 5 Mortal Instrument books I purchased.  I let my 7 year old wear the necklace and even on a child, the necklace fit like a choker.  It's a cute set for the price but definitely wouldn't be worth it if they had charged more for it.  Saw it selling for over $20 on eBay.  Glad I didn't purchase it there since they were asking for 3 times the price as here.  Definitely would have been pissed to have spent almost $25 on this tiny set on eBay when they probably purchased it here and tripled the price for it over there.  They should at least include the word, \\"MINI\\" in the description title.
0805047905|5.0|The book teaches colors and names objects.  It shows the value and importance of education.  I'm not against home schooling.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like the graphics and I no longer find myself running out of battery while in the middle of a good story.
0694003611|5.0|The book is about a little one saying goodnight.  When I read it I found myself looking for the different objects because they are not real obvious.  I can see this as teaching a child to be observant.  One picture is presented as a whole room then the following pages show what the object looked like in the whole room.  There was even a page where the little one said goodnight to nobody and the page was blank.<br /><br />Very entertaining and a great way to bond with a child.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|This book was really fascinating. I found myself wanting to write down passages from it. I also read parts out loud to my husband.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The quality of the image in this blu ray is awful, so grainy, with picture noise. The audio , the same problem with the 5.1.<br />The editing is so so , weird! There are more angles of the audience than madonna. And the quick change of angles, make me dizzy .<br /><br />I want my money back Madonna ?
B000FC12Z0|3.0|This was my first read of Christe and I enjoyed it.The characters were hard for me to follow throughout the story but the ending was good.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Good tasting, but i didn't realize that the 32g comes from TWO scoops, not one, which doubled up my use of it. oh well, still a decent price
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Really?  Best seller? This book had characters that were pointless, it was extremely confusing switching back and forth and was a boring read. The ending was horrible. Life is about a bunch of what ifs.  No one ever knows what happens if something else would have happened. So disappointing.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|If you like this singer, you will LOVE this CD.  She is exceptional, creative, and the organization of her work on this CD is terrific.  The &#34;tunes&#34;  (some) will stay in your head a long, long time, which in this case is good.
B004M20YDU|5.0|this a great album,and has great remixes.for some reason I like this album better than the first tron album. this album is HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|After using the cable for about a week, it would not charge unless you held pressure against it. 2 weeks into using it the end broke off inside my phone. I only plugged it in at night, so it got very little usage. Buy an Apple product. If you want a longer cable, buy an Apple product and extension cord.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Read dis<br />Pretty please it is so great and it is so funny<br />Love is in the air for Greg heffliy
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game is good but only if you spend more money. The perfect game gives no extra repair points so when you continue you start with points from last game when you lost, so where is the progress from last game? Let me start over with all my points and choose different upgrades. Stick with test drive for more of a challenge. No new challenges in full game.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|Really liked this movie as a kid & I found it for a great price. Was shipped in an reasonable amount of time.
B008133MDK|5.0|Love this series!  Cumberbatch and Freeman are fantastic as Sherlock and Watson.  So much great humor in addition to suspense and action.  Can't wait for more!
B001I45UFC|5.0|A wonderful written story.  Every Character comes a life so vividly,.  With the Kindle edition, I really like how you can enlarge the print so my younger kids can read it easly.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|Nobody does Hendrix like Gary Moore. Unreal musicianship, style, speed and quality. Love this dvd will watch again and again.
B00BR9VW32|5.0|Ok, full disclosure, I'm already a Tina Fey fan. Why else would I buy her book? This is one of the few books though that I have read more than once. Tina's humor fills the pages, but she's also a great storyteller. She has entertaining stories about her childhood, her marriage, and her time at SNL. Parts that I love: the rules of improv, the script of Tina and Amy Poehler as Palin and Clinton, and the chapter on her responses to negative fan mail.<br /><br />Reading Bossypants just made me want to meet Tina even more. Like almost to the point of obsession. Perhaps that's the downside of this book.
B0000067L3|5.0|One of the best bands ever in my opinion. Strong songs great art work cD TELLS A VISUAL STORY OF THE BAND AT THE TIME WHEN MUSIC WAS EXPLODING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
1781162646|5.0|This book isn't Stephen King's usual genre, but I wasn't disappointed.  There is a ghost theme, a little bit of a love story and this book made me cry at the end.  I just loved this book and would read it again!

0385349947|3.0|This was one of my first &#34;women power&#34; type books to read. I thought a lot of it was really great. The only complaint I have is that it is very specific to women in corporate businesses. While I went into it knowing that she was a successful business women, I guess I wasn't expecting so much about big corporations and making your way to the top. It was still a very good book though, just not what I really needed.

B00A8MGLAI|4.0|I like the idea of a film that not only can be enjoyed more than one time, but gives more enjoyment from multiple viewings. Cloud Atlas is such a film. It requires multiple viewings due to it's depth and complexity. It's good science fiction from the old school, when a requirement of memorable science fiction was that it provoke a sense of wonder. Cloud Atlas does that. It does suffer a little here and there because of some political correctness, but it's easily ignored. All in all it's a good science fiction film for your library. High production value, great acting, and incredibly beautiful cinematography make it a winner.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is very intertaining to almost everyone. But getting the coins are just 1 of the issues. It takes forever to get to 100 coins. Another thing is that you need to have Internet to play this fun enjoyable game. Other whys. How many stars am I going to rate this game? I would say a four. Ohh if you don't want to spend money on apps. Do not get this 1.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Although many may call it boring, or say that it drags out much to long, its this style of writing that I've always thought was beautiful. Jane Austen always uses such beautiful imagery, and the story in this book is one of my personal favourites. How prideful thinking can come from both sides. I believe both sides of the story are well represented, and there is a reason this wonderful piece of fiction has survived so long.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Why babies can't talk you feel like you are sat around a camp fire with a wise storyteller who is teaching you of the tales from his homeland. I loved this, I enjoy stories that have origins from other countries and these really don't disappoint. Story one is about poverty, a woman named Rosa, a bowl of stolen rice and a river Goddess. That is just to begin with.<br />Although this book is short, for people who like a short story one that they can share some with their children,, this is fabulous! Give it a read.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|&#34;Broadchurch&#34; is a murder mystery much like &#34;The Killing,&#34; in which the entire season is  devoted to solving one murder.  The characters are well developed and complex.  There are many smaller mysteries orbiting the murder -- involving individual character's pasts, relationships, and motives.  I bought the first episode on Amazon, and have watched the rest from BBC America.  The only thing frustrating to me is that I have not been able to get closed captions.
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|The first full-length movie Ron Howard ever directed was \\"Grand Theft Auto.\\" Since then, he has built a storied, award-winning career; now he has come full circle to another auto-racing film. This biography is based on the true story of an Austrian Formula One champion and his British arch rival. I found it thrilling, involving and highly entertaining.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Daniel Brühl (\\"Ladies in Lavender\\") as three-time Formula One champ Niki Lauda, a buttoned-down technocrat, friendless and charmless, but a brilliant analyst who understands all the elements of racing: the track, the engine, the body, the weight, and above all, the competition.<br />  * Chris Hemsworth (\\"Thor\\") as handsome James Hunt, exuding the joie de vivre of international success. He revels in the booze, the drugs and the women that go along with fame and is always the darling of the press because he is so quotable.<br />  * Olivia Wilde (\\"The Change-Up\\") as Suzy Miller, soon to be the famous supermodel Suzy Hunt, who swans into Hunt's life and quickly marries him, much to their mutual regret.<br />  * Alexandra Maria Lara (\\"Imagine\\") is Marlene, who marries Lauda almost on a whim, but who remains in his life as his staunchest friend and ally.<br /><br />Howard gives us a soundtrack that shakes the theater as those powerful engines roar into life, but never neglects the dialogue: We hear every single spoken word in a script where much of the fun is what our two rivals say to (and about) each other. Their top-notch competition brings up the game for both, so they come to realize they need each other. Lauda says, \\"I learn far more from my enemies than from my friends.\\"<br /><br />We already know from reading about this film, that neither one dies in any of the horrific crashes we see, so this isn't a spoiler, but I found comfort knowing in advance that despite treacherous rainstorms and challenging race tracks, these guys still will be with us in the final frame. I always want someone to root for!<br /><br />In this R-rated story, expect nudity, alcohol, drugs, profanity, excitement and a lot of humor. I've signed up with Amazon to be notified when this is available.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I'm not sure why I enjoy this show as much as I do -- perhaps because the plot twists are frequent and regular.  The characters are somewhat two-dimensional, the story line cliche.  But, it IS a super-hero story.  It's just plain fun to watch.
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|Michael Douglas does (\\"Lee\\") Liberace in this made-for-TV movie about his relationship with his hapless companion, Scott Thorson, played by Matt Damon. We get to ogle the lavish lifestyle of an icon who was \\"out\\" in plain sight, his wardrobe, his candelabra, and his baroque furnishings.<br /><br />Although the wigs helped Mike Douglas' depiction, I was more impressed by his take on that distinctive voice. And we couldn't help but feel sorry for his houseboy as Liberace played Svengali, subjecting his current heartthrob to diets, pills, jewelry and plastic surgery.<br /><br />Rob Lowe does a great job as the doctor who lures our naive young chap into the prescription drug scene.<br /><br />Although Scott Bakula seems to be listed as one of the players in IMDb, I saw no evidence of Mr. B. in the story. One of you explained that I had been watching Mr. Bakula but was completely fooled by his mustache and his performance. Wow!<br /><br />I bought my DVD from Amazon.
B009LDD54K|4.0|We didn't think season 3 was as good as 1 & 2.  The first 4 episodes were slightly boring.  The action did pick up and it got better.  Still not as good as 1 & 2 overall.  We sill see what season 4 brings.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|It starts off with very impressive stylistic directing.  I didn't mind, the creative liberties that veered away from F.Scott Fitzgerald's novel much, but they certainly were noticeable.  The acting was somewhat waning, I didn't see a stellar performance from anyone other than Carey Mulligan.  It was enjoyable, but it's only a once thru.  The second time I watched it, the glitz and glamour of the jazz age, got old.  Worth a box of popcorn, maybe a pretzel.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|This app continuously tracked my gps location, even when the app was completely closed. I had to delete it because of this. Too bad because it was a lot of fun!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This film took a new approach to zombies that most traditionalists will despise, speed. Racing zombies are definitely a new spin. Storyline seemed a bit choppy; scenes were established and changed with such frequency that you didn't get the chance to settle in before the next jump scare scene arrived.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I have read all of the Teacher series and all have been a 4 or 5 rating. This I'd a 4. It was a little repetitive , and  confusing at times. But that could just me. I will read the next book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game..... but in some of the 'magic pictures ' the item you are looking for is not really visible. when the set up the page they did not 'bring the item forward in front of the image of the 'magic picture'. you can see this when you use a tool to help you find an item.
B00ET47USI|5.0|i have this game on my computer also and it is really hard to do.  it is even harder on the kindle.  finally won a game after having it for about a month.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|The toy box arrived fast! Looks like pictured. It's a X-Mas gift for my daughter so we weren't able to test it out yet. But I'm sure it will be a great addition to her Barbie collection.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|I have three books on systems thinking and I have appreciated all three. This was the first on I read though that took the subject out of the &#34;justifying and exemplifying&#34; systems thinking and actually took time to illustrate some simple tools to study and document a system. I also loved the final chapter(s) where there was an effort to give guidance principles and nemonics that would help those new to systems thinking to chart their own path to more knowledge and skills with systems thinking.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|It is always nice to have great kid movies out there. Happy Feet is a really great movie for kids.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I don't know that I have ever read a book I more disliked but couldn't seem to put it down.  I don't know that I would recommend it.  All I can say is read it at your on risk or don't read it . Goodbye
B00170DEM8|5.0|I love the old musicals with Gene Kelly and all the other actors from the 30's to the 50's. They are great movies to have around.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This front facing bike seat allows our son to \\"see the world\\" as we're cruising around. It's construction is high quality, ergonomically designed and the seat & front pad are cushioned for a comfy ride. The 5-point harness & foot rest are good safety features, too. We've taken it on local rides & during our big camping trip this past Summer. The seat is easy to remove from the mounting bar, which is convenient when loading up our bikes on the rack. The only criticism, albeit very minor, is the mounting bar is not easily removed for switching to another bike. However, this is better for safety.
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|My nieces age 10 & 12 got really frustrated with this...frankly so did I. Although I will say once you get the hang of it after 100 tries its fine lol. The instructions are confusing, we youtubed for tips after the 20th try. It would be nice if it was clear but not a huge deal, also the tool they give is not very helpful, we actually used real crochet needles. If you have patience then it's fun, if not...not the toy for your kid or yourself.
B00BGI07GC|1.0|I am a big fan of the actors in this, but not even the actors could save this.  The material was soooooooooooooo dumb and predictable.  I can't believe so many people liked this mess of a series.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|It is the best album I have heard in a long time and i love the book of pics that came with it
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The original three movies are still the best in my opinion and most people give Crystal Skull a lot of crap and I share their grief. But these movies are a great way to take an adventure in your living room and have a lazy day watching Harrison Ford kick butt.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I absolutley love this box set.This is my first one and when i seen it i knew i had to have it. i love listening the all the unrealsed tracks and espially the demos.I gives you an insoght of how he work on a song that is really close to recording.i REcomened this to any hard Core Fans Of michael himself and the 5th disc adds a little treat to it.Honestly, i just Freakin love it.<br /><br />  ¢¾¢¾I LOVE YOU MICHAEL!!!!¢¾¢¾
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|My grandson collects legos so this one is a great one that he enjoyed putting it together and is very educational.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|It was perfect!! I felt like I was back when Ozzy & company were together in the 70's!! Must check it out!!!
B006P0FICE|5.0|Awesome movie if you like the three musketeers storyline. It's definitely worth it to get the Blu-ray. It also leaves it wide open for a sequel!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good quality TV and entertainment. Enjoyed watching the series immensely, well worth the money! Oh It's included with Prime! Bonus!
B004H4XLRE|5.0|I bought it for my 5 years old son, he admire Cars 2, and this things is awesome to carry around his collection and also to play with it like a real racing track.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Setup was a bit more challenging than I expected.  Initially I plugged the device in behind my TV and it couldn't find it.  I then plugged it into a side port and after 4-5 attempts it did connect and I was able to stream a TV show.  Tip if you have been watching on lower res on a laptop it will look BAD on a 42&#34; TV.<br /><br />The Good:<br />I tested it with a non-standard streaming site and it worked brilliantly.<br />Sound quality is as good as your TV or sound system (no tinny echos from my laptop and no lag with between the audio and video.)<br />The video quality is completely dependent on your source 320p looks awful, 720 looks broadcast quality,<br />Hulu works fine<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The power plug is rectangular and doesn't fit into european round receptacles.<br />Plugging it into the side of the TV isn't attractive.<br /><br />The Meh:<br />When you first turn it on you have to wait approx 1 min for it to be &#34;Ready to cast&#34;  until it syncs you must wait.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />The power indicator light makes a VERY bright night light (it didn't wake me up but I did make me unplug it to get to sleep).<br />Casting a normal webpage works but the text is miniscule.  Using your browser's zoom helps but isn't perfect.  150% was good for me.<br />AmazonPrime uses a video type that isn't currently supported.
1616551151|3.0|Three stars for a book that has a number of positives and negatives.<br /><br />First, the positives! The illustrations, as many have said, are quite beautiful. Be aware that they follow the concept art style of Dragon Age 2 and subsequent material (Silent Grove, etc) more than Dragon Age: Origins. Not unexpected, as that seems to be the overall art direction of the franchise. A little more vibrant, a little more stylized, but you lose that edge of realism if it's what you prefer. Either way, it's a personal preference issue, and the art in the book is plentiful, high quality, and much of it is brand new. The layout is excellent, reminiscent of a textbook with main sections and plentiful sidebars, the latter of which range from more detailed analysis of a topic briefly touched on in the main body of the text to humorous anecdotes, timelines, and more. While the layout is 'textbook,' the author's have done a good job of making sure the text itself never lingers on one topic long enough to become dry - this is intended as an entertaining reference to a fictional world, and it pulls that off nicely.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are negatives, as well. One is not rightly attributed to this book alone - canon issues within the greater Dragon Age universe. They are numerous at this point, and there is nothing this book could have done about them within it's pages, though it does introduce some inconsistencies that are all its own, as well, which have already been pointed out in other reviews. Be aware however that the information here should be taken with a grain of salt, especially if being used as a reference for a tabletop campaign, fan fiction, etc. Hopefully Bioware can sort out the canon issues and provide a definitive version; it would have been nice if something like that could have been done before releasing a reference guide, or perhaps they intend for the information here to be considered definitive. Also, very little of the information contained here is new, or even provides new details on old information. Careful reading of codex entries in DA:O / DA2 will give you most of the information in this book. For a new retail product, it's not entirely unfair to expect the author's might add further elucidation of important detail, or entirely new information, rather than just gathering what's already known.<br /><br />While general canon issues within the universe reach beyond the scope of this single work and can't be held too much against it, the build quality certainly can. I've seen a few reviews say it has \\"excellent binding\\" or is \\"sturdy.\\" Neither is true. The book uses a wax-chord binding - one of the cheaper binding methods available and one which results in your pages becoming loose due to the perforating effect if the book is referenced often. It also means that if laid open, the page edges will not line up, creasing some portions of the binding more than others. The pages are high gauge, quality paper, at least. The cover is decent but a bit flimsy, made of a fairly pliable cardboard. Overall, nowhere near the construction quality I would expect of a book retailing at 39.99 MSRP - it reminds me of those oversized coffee-table children's books more than anything.<br /><br />Is it worth the money? Probably, to a die-hard Dragon Age fan, who are most likely the only people reading this anyhow. Just know that you might already know everything here, and that it probably won't stand up to constant use as a reference for a tabletop campaign or something of the sort. It's fun to read, though, and would like nice as a coffee-table piece in a collection.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|This is a top-notch show, and the movie is just a ton of fun to watch. These guys were at the height of their powers.<br /><br />My favorite part is where Iggy Pop is standing naked on the top of the pole behind Jerry, his weiner flapping in the summer breeze.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Amazing book!! Wonderful writing!!! Highly recommended!<br />These tales are all amazing!!<br />They are so entertaining and super hot...<br />Excellent story lines..<br />I was totally addicted from page one.....<br />Can't wait to read more books of Luca Rossi..
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|This is not my favorite of the harry potter movies but then again I like them all equally excepting Goblet of fire which I despise (the book as well). This one does however this does have a special place in my heart because this is the only one that I saw in theaters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great book. I couldn't put it down I read it strait through. I would recommend this book!
B00CN8U60Q|4.0|I liked this cd.  It is certainly not my favorite out of all the Blackmore's Night cds but the songs on it are still very good as per usual.
B0064W667Y|5.0|This compiles the first story arc in the ongoing Fables comic series. If you are a fan of shows like Grimm and Once Upon A Time this might appeal to you.
0486268659|5.0|This is my second favorite short story.  It is a wonderful piece of literature at a good price as well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game, you can play bingo or slots.  It's very additive,  hard to quit playing.  I play this one and Bingo Bash the most, because you get more bingo chips to play with, and this one has a free bingo tournament room.
B000W745CU|4.0|This Is my favorite of the harry potter movies though not the books.  It just edges out chamber of secrets.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Tense.  High drama.  One character a brilliant manic depressive , another , suffering from severe post traumatic stress and confused national loyalties.  Both are romantically drawn to each other.  ACTING is  best quality.  PLOTS  convoluted with many turnabouts.
1451673442|4.0|I got this as a present for my mother.  She very much enjoys it.  I an glad I got it.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is really fun to watch. Anna Camp is wonderful. The rest of the cast including the 3 &#34;other girls&#34; in the group are great and the performance numbers by both the women and the men show the work they put into them. Watch the inappropriate dialog section.
B005LAIISA|4.0|I got this as a birthday present for my boyfriend.  We are both young adult and we enjoyed this movie. heck my boyfriend's granddad even likes this movie.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|This movie is great.  Tom Hanks is very believable as a 13 year old in a man's body.  The movie is lighthearted, but still thoughtful.  We should let our inner children come out to play more.
0374533555|4.0|There are two ways of thinking, according to Kahneman, \\"fast thinking\\" and \\"slow thinking.\\" \\"Fast thinking\\" is more intuitive, which for the most part requires no efforts and barely consumes any energy. If someone asked you how much is 2X2, you will use \\"fast thinking\\" to provide an answer. \\"Slow thinking\\", on the other hand, is responsible for more complicated things, such as algebra, for instance.<br /><br />\\"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\\" is an accessible introduction to the life work of Kahneman. In a nutshell, it is a study on the human mind and decision making. An ambitious goal, nonetheless, it tries to achieve more than that. It attempts to help us readers in overcoming the shortcomings and biases of our decision making. I am not sure people will be able to overcome their biases because of this book, but nonetheless, it provides plenty of insights and food for thought.
B00F0349LS|5.0|This album reminds me of why I really enjoy Placebo. My favorite songs are the title track, Bosco, and Too Many Friends but the whole CD is excellent from start to finish!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Engagingly woven tale, with appropriately satisfying character resolutions. The individual stories beautifully connected with each other and the rich fabric that was the cultural, historical and geographic setting.
B003U53GK8|4.0|It was good to see almost all the characters again & get it all put together.  It sure kept us hanging in to find out what was going to happen.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Ruth Ozeki has written a fine story, well-crafted  and engaging throughout.  She offers a masterful weaving of Dogen's Zen teachings, a young Japanese girl's musings, and the narrator's life experience, moving through time and space seamlessly.  Thank you.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|The only bad thing that i could say is the cd box arrived broken, but the rest is perfect!!!<br />I recomend this album<br />BSB are amazing as always!
0486409511|5.0|Amazing, it matched everything the description it said it was. The description was on point. Looking forward to future business together!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is well written and explores the great debates that have always plagued human society, how far does the government need to go to benefit a civilization.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The chrome cast sounded like it would be very useful being able to stream right to the TV from your laptop, but once I got it working<br />it only streams a couple services not what ever you want.<br /><br />Disappointed with its capabilities
B004UID2LC|3.0|If you're like me and have limited access to internet, then this app is useful.  I used it on Kindle Fire 2nd generation.  The ads are at the bottom of the screen &amp; are not intrusive.  You have to use the search function to find the videos you want.  It helps if you already have the names of some favorite channels in mind. You then scroll through the results. I think having a free file manager installed is mandatory &amp; having an alternative media player installed is optional but helpful in using this app. 3 stars for usefulness.
159562015X|4.0|The test is good and pretty on the dot.  It is very revealing and a great tool for organizational management. I wish that they would expand the analysis to more than just the top 5 strengths.  I believe that is optional.  It is worth the cost.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like this game but it's nothing great. I play it and enjoy it for the most part, but not as rewarding as I hoped.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's a great period piece.  Plot twists and beautiful language that entertains the mind and soul. The actors are true to form and the scenes artfully crafted.
0807014273|5.0|Well written and a brief and yet comprehensive work to aid all who seek meaning and purpose in life.  Has stood the test of time.
B0071MV540|5.0|I retired 32 years in the corporate world Saw so many of these type of Eggheads using and taking advantage of hardworking people.We are all the same.The ending gave me great satisfaction.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it.  I found it so personal and real.  I can see why Oprah made it a part of her book club.  I really did not care about the contravery over the book,  I loved it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|A true picture of different expectant woman. Your hopes, dreams about the baby. Some sad for us and some lucky to bear their own. But to me even adopting a child is a wonderful one! Funny too!
020530902X|5.0|Easy to use, simple rules with examples. I can see why so many people recommend it. Now I know how to use commas!
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is very entertaining and challenging.  My husband says I&quot;m addicted to it!  I especially like the length of time given to find the objects.p
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was referred this book by a friend and boy was it a good  referral. The point of view is outstanding!
B008469DGY|4.0|Nice graphics.  Good interface.  Simple gameplay yet challenging because the required score to advance to the next course increases significantly so you better get skilled at hitting the target and making hole in ones. In short, it's fun...
0307352153|5.0|This was a Book Club choice and provided material for a great discussion. The general feeling is that we so overrate extroversion and place such a stigma  upon introversion in our society, which causes  a disservice to our American culture. A must read for educators.
B003M6FGTE|3.0|I watched this expecting it to be amazing because of all of the hype and popularity.....but it was just okay.
B000O599ZS|5.0|A major addition to my movie collection. John Wayne starred in so many different types of movies but I always enjoy the westerns.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game could have better graphics. It is fun to play. Children 5-8 would find it most enjoyable. Would recomment it for younger children.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Another great Star Trek movie - although it could be a lot better if it was an original plot and not a mish mash of rehashed plots already used.  They should be able to do better.  And I agree with several other reviews - stop the annoying lens flare!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|YouTube is very helpful when looking up information. Sometime you can get the wrong thing. Not everything is appropriate for young people.  There should be an age limit.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The writing style made it difficult for me to stop reading.  I was on the edge of my seat and marveled that I don't usually read books like this.  It was intriguing, imaginative and riveting.  I have not read Neil Gaiman before, but I hope to read him again.  I highly recommend this story if you want to be lifted out of your everyday world.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|I just recently got 'addicted' to podcasts, before I never even considered listening.  But the job I have now allows me a lot of time to listen to things while I work. When I got tired of music and audiobooks I decided to try some podcasts.  For a newbie the interface is quick and easy to understand and to start using. I started with some shows I knew I wanted to listen to but found several more easily by browsing through their search site.  If you are interrupted while listening to your podcast it remembers where you left off (even when you don't!), and it's easy to listen to several podcasts at the same time using the playlist to pick and choose which one you want to listen to at any given point. It has a neat and orderly interface, and lots of capability that I probably haven't even begun to use. I have the free version but I am seriously considering donating for the 'pay version' not because anything is lacking or to get rid of the few ads (which are not at all bothersome) but to support good app programing! Thank you Podcast Addict for a super app, I honestly can't think of one thing that I would want that this app doesn't provide for my podcasting enjoyment.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I played this when amazon gave it away free. It took about a week to finish playing around real life,i used the help button about 5 times when things got hard to find or figure out, other than that the play was great it a fun game i played on a<br />Velocity micro cruse t408 tablet and it worked fine.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After reading it, I thought this would make a great movie. I just heard that it is in the making. Gillian Flynn did not disappointment me.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|I love this show - I've been a zombie fan since the 70's when Night of the Living Dead made me lose sleep as a kid.  The shows are great.  My only wish is that they had the latest &#34;Webisodes&#34; on the bonus material disk with commentary.  Since I'm wishing, I wished they had commentary on every episode, but they are generally only have one commentary per disk.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I was very happy to see that Jack Reacher is back in action. After the last very disappointing episode in Despair Colorado, I was going to give the author one more chance. He delivered, I was not disappointed at all. Very good story line and character development. Set in New York, with bad guys you want to hate.,This book has it all. Thanks for bringing Jack Back.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Easy read but occasionally challenged on the vocabulary.  Entertaining.  Not a rave, but I enjoyed it.  Kept me company on the exercise bike at the gym.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is just a fun movie, lots of action and great actors that seem to have fun during the movie.
B008RKIACK|4.0|Warriors. Come out and Play! Worth a watch. Great to see the gang underworld across NYC in the late 70s.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Not a big Tom Cruise fan, but a Science Fiction Fan and this movie was great.  I have watched it three times since I have received it.
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review on anything before.  However after reading this book I had to say something. This book is complete trash. I bought the first book and started reading it. After several chapters i couldnt understand why it was such a big hit.  I continued to read it thinking....something big has to happen soon. I went as far as buying the second book in hopes that the mystery of why this book is such a hit would reveal itself.  It never did. I refused to accept that a book so bad would be on a best sellers list.  And whats worst is that it is has three part of total crap.  After awhile i could predict what the author would say next. \\" she flushed, as he cocks his head to the side\\". What the hell! Someone owes me an explanation. How did this book become such a big hit? After a few chapters of reading i started scanning the words to find something anything with substance but just could not. Dont waste your time.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|We love this movie! We've watched it at least a dozen times in the past month! It is a must by plus their extra scenes are great!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Didn't expect this to be such a fun thriller. I don't consider it a \\"scary\\" movie despite the zombies. I have been suggesting to all my horror buff friends to watch with an open mind and just enjoy the ride.
B006UKC566|5.0|The movie it self is great and I had to have it in 3D not just bluray. the price was great and everything came intact and worked flawlessly.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show is a great way to pass the time! I've enjoyed it ever since starting the series in 2009 and this season did not disappoint.
B00ELU7A4E|3.0|I have to say the week this song came out, I listened to it. I enjoyed it enough to retain interest in Katy Perry's new album. I however am done with this topic of self empowerment. I realize she went through a divorce, that was okay the first time she sang about. I accepted Part of Me and Wide Awake even though I really didn't like the songs. She had to get all of her pain out.<br /><br />Now two years later we're still dealing with this? What the hell Katy. You should not be so upset. You were the only one who didn't realize Russell was a serial cheater and then surprise of all surprises you act shocked and hurt when he cheats on you. Katy it's time to move on or at least present a public front that you've moved on. I am just not here to listen to your problems anymore. I was sympathetic at first, but now I have moved on and I need you to as well. Let's go back to having fun riding in your jeep and partying on Friday night. Occasionally you can reference and direct all your anger on non-single tracks that I'm not bombarded with at every turn when the radio's on.<br /><br />Musically this song is very much in line with Katy's past offerings. It's not her best, but certainly not her weakest. This is not a song to shun if you love Katy Perry. I however do not love her enough to be down with this song. One thing I will always stand by is that Katy needs to find a new lyrcist 'I got the eye of the tiger' really Katy? That was the best you could do for us? It barely worked for Survivor in the eighties and is as close to a trademark as they ever had. You can not blatantly steal from them.<br /><br />If you love this song, but are not buying into Katy's whole 'I've now moved on from Russell and I'm better for it', then I strongly recommend Sara Barelles 'Brave' that features just as strong of vocals and similiar musical backing. You'll find the similiarities shocking.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Decent movie overall but I found myself board and grabbing for my ipad.  I was hoping for much more action and a little more realistic set up.  At least as much as you can hope for in a zombie flick.  I am Legend is a much better movie in my opinion.  The zombie chattering his teeth was the straw that broke the camels back.  I wanted to believe but just kept thinking...how retarded!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This may be the fact that I got it for free during like a promo or something but I love this game, good graphics a nice selection of cars and some very well put together scenery
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Good game, pretty hard in some levels, the physics in the game are stunning, zero lags and great colors, 100% recommended
B004SVM7BW|5.0|This has got to be ONE of the best PDF readers out there.  Use it all the time on all my devices.
0984183523|4.0|I would suggest this book to anyone who is seriously considering consulting. This book goes over the basics of how interviewers think (which is very important to your success so I'm told) as well as how to structure most cases. Some of the things it lacks are extended examples and some basic business acumen that would be necessary for someone with an Advanced Degree. Thus I highly recommend supplementing this book with another (ie Case in Point). Both give great advice, but make up for where the other lacks.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good novel with plenty of irony.  Watch for an &#34;eye for an eye&#34;.  Unanticipated outcome as the husband's secret is revealed.
B00BKQ02GA|5.0|This book is by far one of the best written novels I've read. The style of Michael Cunningham is at its best here (not in vain was this work worth a Pulitzer for him).<br /><br />The redaction is absolutely immersive, real and organic. The portraits of every character are totally believable and living, and the story is very humane and present.<br /><br />Although &#34;The hours&#34; is very closely linked to &#34;Mrs Dalloway&#34;, by Virginia Woolf, it shines with its own light and is a total delight by itself. (You don't have to read &#34;Mrs Dalloway&#34; to understand &#34;The hours&#34;, but if you do you will find a bigger treasure in this book)
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Everything was just as they said. Movie worked perfect. My grandaughter loves it. But my daughter found this movie on line at Barnes and Noble for half the price I paid for this one. I need to shop a little more to find better deals.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|OK, as a movie I would give it 4 stars. As a musical I would give it 4 stars. But the performances of Ellen (Audrey 1) and Rick (Seymour) get like 10 stars, oh and the trio of singers. Therefore, this is one of my favorite pieces of entertainment I have ever seen. Even if you don't like musicals, you could like this! Just go somewhere that's green and watch it.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|One case is broken and season 1 disc 1 is hard to hear, no matter how loud you turn it up. But as a whole I like it.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Totally worth it!  Works awesomesauce and I love it.  Highly entertaining.  I recommend it to 2 year olds and up.  Join the pork side and have fun!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|A great solution if you own a tablet but not a Kindle. The download was easy and the books where available to read within minutes, saved me outlaying dollars on another device.
B0058YPGL6|4.0|it started out a little slow. but it got better as it when along. the actors also got better.and the season was to short.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|fun read i bought it on the kindle for 5 bucks and it was worth every penny different than the movie
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Fun game can't put it down sometimes. Just wish you could do more upgrade.its not to hard<br />Need more money but I give it a5
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend it for young teens and old teens this is a book that needs to be shared with everyone from each four corners of the world
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really do like Facebook a lot<br />Like I get to see other people some of them be my family some be friends Facebook is very awesome
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is really fun and exciting you get to get costume for them and its just like temple run for me except you have engines.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely fabulous acting and plot.  You will be drawn into the series almost immediately. Gawd Amazon needs six more words !  There
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I liked the Dr Quinn Movies. So I Watch the complete television series. which i enjoyed also. I intend on buying other related series and movies in the future.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great flick! May have ended a little quickly and left you wondering how to fill in the pieces, but whatever. Great zombie movie!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Episodes just don't come fast enough. We own all the seasons right now, and just can't wait for more to come out. Every episode is packed!
0062255657|3.0|I'm a Neil Gaiman fan from way back, but this was a disappointment. It seemed somewhat thin and lacking in literary substance. I didn't really care about the characters and the story was forgotten within a few days of finishing it.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I like the science and the people.  It is great to see a show with &#34;nice&#34; people for once instead of deeply flawed ones.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It works for me and it saved having to purchase a new &#34;extra&#34; charging cable when I bought my new MacBook Retina. With this I was able to use my old one, too. Recommended!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|We live in a neighborhood where part of our dues pay for wifi.  Since there is a splash screen to log in, we cant use it.  We are thinking of setting up a private network, but why bother.  So if you live in an apartment, dorm, condo, hotel don't bother.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was very disappointed that the chrome cast was not applicable with other websites. Also, i could not get it to work with my Samsung galaxy s2 phone. It specifically stated on the box that you can send video or anything on the web to your tv from your smartphone,tablet or laptop. However, I can set up you tube on my iPad to stream to my Tv.
1844488748|4.0|This book puts the reader into another era of decore, So with the help of this particular book and its great instructions I will succeed in my endeavour.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo's Reef is fun &amp; exercises your memory while its colorful ambiance is soothing to the eyes as it really imitates the natural underwater world of small species of fish to its glorious state.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I think you would have to buy the other two books for this to make any sense to you. But I do admit it is a great book. I hope there is another one in this series.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|World War Z the novel, hit an over-saturated genre and removed itself from the pack with its Ken Burns style approach.  This could have been a great adaption and not ANOTHER example of Brad Pitt's failure to carry a movie.  He is at his best when he is one of a number of good performances.  As it is, Brad Pitt's WWZ is a fairly entertaining bit of fluff that's alright to stumble across on cable, not a must-see to go plunk down your hard-earned $15 (or more dollars).<br /><br />Sticking to the source material's vignette approach would have made a memorable take on the Zombie film.  Hopefully, someone will one day adapt the book the way it should have been done, as an episodic high-end cable piece.  Not a multi-year series, but a faux Ken Burn's documentary.  Oh well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 3 year old grandson plays this on my kindle fire every time he gets in my car for a ride. Nothing is better than listening to him giggle as he is chasing the minions. Cute!
B00EUM5O4Q|5.0|But in the best way possible. As it says at the top this is, obviously, the uncensored version of the album. Honestly, there is a quite a bit of profanity on this album, and if you purchase the censored version, you're not going to get the same experience. This album is definitely geared more towards young adults anyways.<br /><br />However, it is somewhat of a departure from her first album. The songs on Perfectionist, her first album, were more synth-beats, and it was definitely more pop-driven party tunes. Trouble is something considerably different. There are a few synth-beats on this, but the content of the songs is considerably more emotional, and her voice is much more powerful. Even though it is quite different, each track is something unique, especially her song, Controversy, which is truly unique to this album. I give 5/5 stars, and if you enjoyed her first album, you should definitely pick it up.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|This is an addicting game.  Love mind games this is for you!  Just the right challenge and fun for all ages.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was very relevant and explores all sides of a very tragic event. I couldn't put this book down.
B0064MGU98|4.0|This series is great. I never heard of it until Amazon Prime video introduced me. The character's are interesting and the story line has been intriguing.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|So far so good. Was able to set alarm. I Will reassess how well it works after I have used it for a week.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|the world's greatest innovator and jerk.  Wow, the story was well told and it is compelling but what a jerk Jobs was.  His wife deserves all $12B after putting up with his crap.
B0093WVND4|5.0|My 2nd grade teacher read this to our class... Now I have a 2nd grader of my own to read it to.  We loved it.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|As others have commented, the remastering really freshens the sound of these classic albums and to my ears, The Clash have never sounded better.<br /><br />It seems that a lot of care has also been taken with the presentation of this boxed set - the CDs are reproductions of the original vinyl, complete with liner notes; Sandinista! includes a mini version of 'The Armagideon Times No.3' insert & Combat Rock has a small (2\\" x 4\\") copy of the poster included with the original release.<br /><br />The box itself is well made and will look great on a shelf next to your Clash Singles box set.  They've also included a 'DIY cut out The Clash stencil & I Fought The Law badge' cardboard insert.<br /><br />This ranks right up there with The Smith's 'Complete' box set, both in terms of sound quality & presentation.  And, like the original vinyl, it's priced so that all the young punks (& even casual fans) can enjoy it.  It's a must have!
B000X5SPBI|1.0|The disk where all here and the package arrieved opened  was suppose to be a birthday gift for my husband, No one will help fix the problem for 4 days now it getting annoying and really old.
0385344333|1.0|I love the series and could not wait to read this one on a recent flight. It was such a disappointment ! It is boring but because he has never previously disappointed I assumed it would get better. No.. A quick terrible wrap up. I felt so let down when I finished this book.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|This mouse is the best I have ever owned, it has all the features I need and more. It is excellent for games and the presets make using this thing a breeze. The only reason I give this four instead of five is that it is *too* sensitive. The mouse icon will drift whilst the mouse is not being touched or moved, not through any fault of the hardware, but because the vibrations from my desk fan are just enough to register on the mouses sensor. While this isn't a world ending problem I am slightly warmer while playing. Oh well :P
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Colors were great and special effects were wonderful.  Some surprising plot twists and a fun and humorous movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so many things all in the same place! what a wonderful idea! I could play on there all day long!
B004V9MU86|5.0|The Book Thief is a very interesting take on a bleak period of human history. The narrators trepidation is equal to that of his subjects. I highly recommend you stick out and finish the story, despite its length.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Songs are great, it's wonderful to sing to and they are one of my favorite groups.  Price was spot on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and entertaining but when i updated it,it erased everything and i had to start from the beginning. But overall it is really fun i recommend this game for all ages.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|My camera requires using this card, does a good job and holds lots of pictures.  Expensive compared to SD cards, but this is a must for me.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|This product really lived up  to the hip and all I liked it so much that I shared it with a friend
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app.  I think it is a good thing that I have to put this app down for my energy to be replenished.  I would play the game to much.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I really loved this movie!  It was not at all what I thought it would be.  There were moments that made me fall out laughing, great action that had me on the edge of my seat, scenes that shocked me and scenes that made me sad.  It was a really good movie and I'm looking forward to the sequel!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing . That's it. It is one of the best books I've ever read in my life . Just amazing
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Broken City is a great movie!  You are wondering how the bad guy will get his until the very end.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read the first one just before the movie came out, didn't see what all the fuss was about...really didn't like the first one...this one is way better, it's a page turner!! Can't wait to read the next one!!! :)
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great collection of music - felt like we were right there at the concert!!  Highly recommend this purchase - you won't be disappointed!
6305781427|5.0|Awesome. The best of Yanni in my opinion! The quality of the video and the sound isnt that great for today standards because of the age of the recording but it doesnt really matter
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with you: A Crossfire Novel was a great book to read. This is part of a series. Couldn't put the book down.  Can't wait for the next book.

B00006FDCD|1.0|Major sections of the movie where missing on this DVD.  From the very beginning.  The sceen when they boy was pulled into the drain and killed to the death sceen of Richard Masur.  Not sure who did the editing of this version but he/she was an idiot.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you: A Crossfire Novel was a great book to read. This is part of a series. Couldn't put the book down.
B00ALCBU4M|4.0|Acting is okay, story is good, and action is pretty much non stop. I would recommend to others looking for war action entertainment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i have played this and it is AWESOME but don't understand the 1 star reviews a<br />they read: game is bad and dont buy i dont believe in them
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Found that in the middle it got a little redundant, but what a wonderful job on a tough subject.  I couldn't put it down.  And it was like I was watching a movie the description and feeling that I was in the room where so vivid.
B0091THDOM|5.0|great little wallet for iphone 5 :3<br />im happy with it, but due to alot of wear and tear, don't expect it to last more than a year. i take my phone out alot.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|Fun game, but after completing a couple of levels, the screen starts to have little flashes of lights and the game slows down.  I've tried redownloading a couple of times and even deleted a couple of apps from my kindle fire to free up space.  Nothing has seemed to help.  Hopefully after an update, these can be fixed.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After playing it for a couple of days now, I realized that the flashes in the screen occur after you complete a level and it flashes on the bottom of the screen whatever achievement you may have accomplished.  The flashes and stuttered play, last for one round (level) and then they quit until you achieve another \\"accomplishment.\\"
B007SGLZH6|4.0|Great bread using the recipes in the book, but it does require a lot of time to make the best loaves. I prefer the approach of lahey or the five minute a day guys as they a lot less labor intensive and produce a fairly high quality product.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Predictable plot. This movie had so much potential. The previews were better than the actual movie. The movie had such a great cast and such a good premise but did not follow through.
1609611543|1.0|Food Fix: Hello, whole-wheat pasta and potatoes!<br /><br />\\"Our bodies run on carbohydrates,\\" says Zerner. \\"It's too bad they've gotten a bad rap.\\"<br /><br />In a Tufts University study, women on a carbs-restricted diet did worse on memory-based tasks compared with women who cut calories but not carbs. And when the low-carb group introduced them back into their diet, their cognitive skills leveled out.<br /><br />Carbs help your body burn fat without depleting muscle stores for energy. The ideal diet is 50 to 55% complex carbohydrates, 20 to 25% protein and 25% fat. Complex carbs provide energy as they're digested, while protein and fat, along with fiber, slow the digestion process so the boost lasts a good long time.<br /><br />\\"Think about getting a mix of high-quality protein, carbohydrates and fat from whole, unprocessed foods over the course of any given day,\\" says Katz. \\"That's really all we need.\\"
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I do not use a laptop. So I was depending on my Kindle Fire (and desktop computer) to use this Chromecast device. I searched the literature, Google said android devices and tablets would work. Kindle Fire is an android device (tablet) so I thought it would work. I could not set up, so called Google and they told me my Kindle Fire does not work with Chromcast. I do not have an android phone and will probably never get one. I am disappointed, Chromecast is a nifty product. I have an older Roku player, there is an app for Roku that works well with my Kindle Fire. I will probably update my Roku player.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|5 stars I would recommend this to everyone. It is a great way to meet new people and reconnect with old ones.
B00049QQHI|1.0|not much to say about this a scene of homoproposition looked promising. that woman is always drugged up and anoying
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It is a very good game in itself but they charge way too much for some things. I bought some gems that were originally$9.99 and they were supposed to be $4.99, well I bought them and they still charged me the full price!
B003VW8GT6|5.0|Excellent actors, John Wayne and Dean Martin.<br />Ricky Nelson was a kid. This movie is one of my<br />favorite John Wayne movies. Also Walter Brenan<br />was excellent, another great actor.
B007RX32XK|5.0|I imported this before it was released in the States. Best choice! I've since seen them live at Bonnaroo and can say they are a spectacular band!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The game has been fine (other than the outrageous costs for ponies using gems) up until I actually started losing gems when I leveled up. I thought I had been imagining things until the fourth time. When leveling up, one would receive one to two gems, which I still do, but in addition to that I lose three or more gems. It has happened at least three or four times.<br />When I began playing today, I had eight but when I checked on them again, I had seven. This time I had not leveled up or used any.<br />I have already 'reported an issue' and will continue to find other ways to alert the app creator, or SOMEONE THAT CAN DO SOMETHING, about this problem.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have listened to this many times now - this is a great singer and a great CD- love it.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It was difficult to use and kept locking up my laptop; I had to uninstall it so my laptop would work properly.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Using his well-known writer's gifts, Ken Follett weaves the lives of several families into the history of the period just before<br />WW2 and after it. His characters come alive as the Nazis try to conquer the world, Stalin butchers his people, and the French and English people bravely fight and suffer. The United States enters the fray at Normandy and we see the war in the Pacific begin with Pearl Harbor sneak attack by the Japanese. His characters move through history in love and hate, jealousy, nobility, and savagery. Follett is a master storyteller. If you would like a dose of history with  your stories, here is the book for you.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Great classic! My parents still speak of it, I feel like every family  should own a copy of gremlins! nh

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game on Kindle fire.  I have never had any issues.  Some people complain of freezing and such but I have never had this happen.  Very fun and addictive.  Easy to understand...my 6 year old plays with ease.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|My boyfriend is obsessed with the ice age movies! I had to get this for the price it was selling for!

B004EPYZOO|5.0|My boyfriend wanted this, he craved this movies forever so when I saw it on amazon I had to reach out and get it for him!
B00CS74W0C|3.0|Sooooo....I don't even really know where to go with this review. I bought this as a box series, expecting it to contain all parts of the story lol, and come to find out, nope! There's going to be not one, but TWO more books to this series! I'm sorry but for $10 a book, I'd like a little less sex (I skip right through the sex scenes anyway, I read for the romance, not the sex) and more freaking closure! About 50% of the way through this series, I got so fed up and bored with it that I didn't read it for a couple weeks. Then I remembered I paid a lot of money for this stupid series so I was going to finish it. Imagine my disappointment when I didn't get any closure. The first two books were pretty good, the third was fluff and I won't be reading the last two. I bought this because I heard it as being better than fifty shades, and I can assure you it was not.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, I loved it, had to buy it when I saw it was selling for such a good price while I was browsing through other films!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A wonderful book. Don't know how they made it into a movie, A great story of a man and  wild animal....... It's different.
140006922X|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it quite fascinating- the author captures the political atmosphere of the time beautifully and I learned so many things I didn't know about how much Rome controlled and influenced the Jewish people at that time- among them that they quite possibly were responsible for the death of Jesus rather than the Jews they pinned it on.<br /><br />However, I was a little back and forth on his theory of Jesus as a wild political revolutionary.  I'm sure He, like any decent Jew at the time certainly had His opinions and His voicing of them could have indeed led to His death but at the same time I think Mr. Aslan takes a great deal of the Bible far more literally than it was ever intended to be taken.<br /><br />There are indeed discrepancies in the four gospels written about Jesus which, taken purely historically, would probably  discredit the authors- however I think doing so would be a wild misinterpretation of the style in which they were written and the message they were intended to convey.  I personally believe certain parts of the retelling of the life of Christ- much like the parables He Himself used to teach- were meant more as a symbolic representation of the journey of the soul towards truth than so much a word for word historical biography.
B009EEPPQ2|1.0|Live Free or Die Hard is a disgrace to the name of Die Hard, it's one of the most unnecessary and also most uneventful action movies ever made. They literally take everything that made Die Hard good and disregarded it and made it like every other generic action movie. I loved the first and third movie, but this, I will argue and say it's the worst action movie to come around in 10 years, it's unforgivable.<br /><br />The movie begins with John McClane who is talking to his daughter over the phone, you get an idea that all these years of fighting John McClane is burnt out, aged and tired. He is assigned to safely escort a hacker played by Justin Long who is probably one of the most annoying characters ever. He learns there's more to the job, there are terrorists out to kill him, because he's a skilled hacker. The villain has an agenda to breach and hold America hostage. The villain by the way is lame, uninteresting, unlike the other villains in the Die Hard movies, he's forgettable and rather poorly written. Also, John McClane makes an attempt to stop the guy. He does so with the annoying hacker. He also has a taxi cab fly and hit a helicopter. You know, stuff you'd only see in a Transporter movie.<br /><br />I understand that Die Hard movies are loaded with impossible stuff, but this took it too far. A car hits a chopper, then John McClane drives a car into a building and then there is a scene where he is on a plane. Also, unlike the other Die Hard movies, the action was lame. Very uneventful, no intensity whatsoever. The first Did Hard movie (The best Action movie of all time) it held my interest, it was intense and suspenseful. This one, nothing, I actually daydreamed throughout the entire movie, I honestly didn't care, I wanted the movie to end. I am shocked at the rave reviews this movie got. I guess since the general public loves it, I must be wrong right? Well, I can go on and on about that topic but I choose not to.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is terrible. Len Wiseman as a director for it really didn't contribute, I feel his style works great for music videos but not so much for movies. I'd like to see him tackle maybe a fantasy movie in the likes of Dark Crystal or maybe Legend. Something with less action, he has an interesting visual idea but this movie, his style didn't work. I also mostly blame the writers for this. Anyways, Live Free or Die Hard is terrible, I will go off and say, I give it an F.e.

B00CRJSWBQ|1.0|I purchased this motherboard so a dear friend could custom-build a computer for me.  The first one turned out to be defective, so I returned it and got a replacement.  My friend installed that one and now *that* one is bad too.  This is a man who knows his computers (in fact, works with them all day long, and has custom-built my computers for the past 15 years with no problems).<br /><br />Asus used to be the creme de la creme as far as MBs go.  Not any more, apparently. The second board is going back and I'll have to find a different manufacturer for my needs.<br /><br />Buh-bye Asus!  You've lost a customer!  (And probably more than just one!)
B0094KTAEY|5.0|Now that I can buy digital version and watch on my XBox through the Amazon App, I have no reason to buy old-fashioned disks that cost 3 times more and come with a bunch of silly features that my child is NOT interested in.  Great job on figuring out what a modern family needs, Amazon!  Keep the new Disney titles coming. =)
0307352153|5.0|I've always been quiet and introverted, but I didn't really realize that I was an introvert until much later in my life. Once I started hearing about introverts and realized that I related 100% to them and that I wasn't a freak of nature because I liked my solitude and quiet times.<br /><br />I bought this book to learn more about introverts. It has been very insightful and Susan clearly knows what she is talking about. I heard about this book after watching the TED talk that Susan gave. Worth a watch if you've not seen it.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who is an introvert or may have an introvert in their life.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This used to be the best bingo game on the Kindle & Facebook.  Not any longer!  It was as much fun gifting items that teammates needed, as it was finishing collections.... and often necessary.  I have a team of 11, that have been playing since the game came out from Buffalo Studios.  Often times, one or more accounts would never get a certain item... so the teammates could help each other.  Then we would move on helping others. The new owners of the game have ruined it!  Items that must be found un a chest... are never there.  Some items must be won, but never get the shadow card.  Out of my eleven teamies & me.. ONE has completed the last three rooms.  Guess what?  None of us will buy another token pack to play, like we have in the past.  Waste of time & money.  Move on.  Not worth the stress
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Love Letter....doesn't sound like a game I'd like to play to be honest. It also comes in a red velvet bag....ewww.. However, once you get past the name and the bag you realize what a great game Love Letter is. So very simple with only 16 cards and only two cards to pick from on your turn, but so much strategy in how you use those cards.<br /><br />Basically each card has some text on it indicating what you can do with that card. You draw a card on your turn, pick between the two cards and do what the discarded card indicates. Player with the highest numbered card or the last player in the round wins the round and gets some attention from the princess.<br /><br />Overall this game is a very simple but very fun game that can be played in 20-30 minutes with 4 players. Can't recommend it enough.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|was very happy with its wonderful condition and its speedy arrival i would recommend to anyone who likes its type
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love the piano guys ever since I started following them on YouTube. This CD continues taking some of the songs from their YouTube channel and putting them on a CD. I think this disc is a bit weaker than the first, but still the music is great.<br /><br />I love how they meld pop and classical together into something so fun and enjoyable to listen to. All my kids put the two albums on their iPods and go around the house listening to them constantly.<br /><br />Can't recommend this enough.

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I look forward to Wednesday nights.  The acting is tremendous.  It keeps me wondering how it is going to end.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|While starting a bit slow, the story picked up momentum and became a page-turner.  The story was believable as were the characters.  Enough was left from from the story to make following the series a necessity.  Low tech sci-fi, post apocalypse dystopia.  A good read I'd recommend.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I admit I wanted to find out what happened in this book, but I felt there was  TOO much explanation of symbols, Masons, etc. The authors slant on scripture and history is also very New Age philosophy. He interprets things that way then puts it off as truth since the ones finding out this information are scientists and respected researchers. For instance, his slant on Jesus and Christianity is way off base for those who are believers and read the Bible in context. I was disappointed in the writing and the subject matter. Not sure if I will read another book of his...
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|The Steel box the movie came in was very good quality craftsmanship. I would highly recommend to any movie collector.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Officials you love Star Wars&trade; then this is the app for you.Also this time they made it where you can launch pigs and defeat birds,and you can use telepods to teleport  your angrybirds Starwars bird or pig figure into the game.Another nice touch is that you can use more characters including:Count Dooku,The Emperor,Mace Windu,Darth Vader ,and many more.Some people may have said other apps are<br />must-gets but this one is a Definite-get.
B000NE6FUM|5.0|just what I was looking for and delivered in better condition than expected. This is one of my all time favorites.  A small dream to own this record is complete
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very happy with it. Easy to use with an Android phone. Enjoy streaming from Netflix and Youtube. I love it!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Forgive Them, Gene Roddenberry, They know not what they do or did!<br /><br />While this flick might provide for a satisfactory pubescent [blow-em-up while you pop-your-zits] type of video game experience, but as an old school sci-fi kind of trekkie,<br />my expectations were to be captivated by inspiring, intelligent dialogue, thought provoking,thrilling plot & the timeless monumentality of Gene Roddenberry's characters[Kirk & Spock, & Co].<br />In this version of Star Trek, plot & dialogue have been replaced by incessant blinding explosions, flashy artificial space-goober visual effects, staccato,<br />repetitive weapon-blasts, in a melee of mindless, testosterone-inspired battles. The blah, bland, bromidic, clich&eacute;d, cornball, cornfed, corny,<br />dull as dishwater, lack-luster, unconvincing, performances of the actors was just uncomfortable & unfulfilling to watch;<br />in summery- this entire production could be described as a cringe-worthy & dumbed-down caricature of *The Real Deal*. Sad.<br />Someone here, had written that the director of this movie[J.J. Abrams]should be taken out back & shot, *grins*; I don't agree.<br />I think it should be a slow death that hurts a whole lot- as a memorable life lesson<br />to never, no matter how much personal/financial gain can be realized, take something<br />of brilliance, wit, originality, & excellence & turn it into Drek, into Darkness.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|Greatest movie ever. &#34;There is more to a life than being ridiculously good looking, and I'm going to find out.&#34; so many great lines.
B00F91H666|5.0|Edge-of-seat flick from start to finish! Well written,very credible apocalyptic plot that kept an intense pace from the opening scene. The visual effects were unique & ambitious,in portraying the massive scope of horror that would accompany a world-wide outbreak of a deadly epidemic. The acting was very well-crafted to the plot & the cinematography was awesome. Excellent flick- highly recommend it as one the best of its genre.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is an easy fun way to play and escape boredom. It's a great way to also improve your memory skills.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|My son plays this game and asks me why does it keep freezing. I assume it's still got a few bugs.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I loved the first Die Hard movie but none of the rest ever seemed to match it.  Sure, the explosions and gun fights are bigger and better and the stakes are higher but you can see that Bruce really doesn't care any more.  And what's worse, he has admitted that he doesn't care, that he just does the action movies for the money and nothing else.  I did like Jai Courtney in this.  I think he has great potential with a good script and other actors that actually care about the movie and not how much they're getting paid.  Anyway, the story was entertaining enough if a little (okay, a lot) far fetched.  Would have been nice to see Bruce try a little harder though.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This game required some ridiculous download space and never really opened, so we never got to play it. Consequently, I took it off my Kindle almost immediately.
1416987118|5.0|My son has a hard time sitting still when I read him books except when I read him the Bear Hunt book. He loves making all of the sound effects as I read it. This books is great for actively engaging your child in the reading process.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Excellent product design.  Well executed and performs at a level that belies its price.  Now has an &#34;anti-counterfeit&#34; feature in the packaging, which worked well.  Highly recommended.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Ordered for my Ipad and finished this entertaining read on vacation. I like books that keep you turning the pages and this book had no boring lulls. Haven't watched the movie but I have a feeling the book is better.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|It's difficult to describe this book because it definitely is a bit cheesy and derivative of the Black Dagger Brotherhood or any other series where there are shifters belonging to \\"packs,\\" \\"covens,\\" or some type or \\"order.\\" We the readers are also asked to suspend belief yet again when it comes to clothes that magically appear after shifting, or the fact that these HUGE men walk around the big city packed with muscle and growling orders at people, but are still somehow seen as genius level business tycoons. Usually this is enough to make me stop reading a novel. So glad that it didn't stop me this time because I would have missed out!!!! Dragos is hot! Barrons level hot!!! Ms. Harrison does an excellent job of creating the ultimate romantic and sexual tension between Dragos and Pia. The heroine is clever without being too cutely sarcastic. You never waiver into slapstick the way I feel about some of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books. These two are AMAZING together. I would give this one five stars, but it does have a lot of typical paranormal clichés. Still, it's worth reading. You will not be disappointed as long as you are reading it for a well developed toe curling Alpha Male rush!!!!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|She is so whiney and needy all the while acting like Dexter is not being sensitive to her needs. Give him a break already! He has needs too. And people to kill.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|This was much smaller than I thought it would be, especially for the price. There is a picture of the figures on the box in 'actual size' and they even look smaller than the usual figures. Lego might be capitalizing on a trend... My seller delivered within the time frame and the package arrived unscathed.
0553288105|4.0|Still reading but the concept of the &#34;pump&#34; between worlds that gives unliminted energy is intriguing. Hope the end wraps it all together and does not do a &#34;star child&#34; ending....

B0044IABFS|5.0|Really good show but wished it had a different ending. It kept you wanting to see more. It also kept you guessing.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|G.P.A,as his name suggests, delivers. Revenge of The Orgasm is a wonderful,sensual,erotic collection. Beautifully worded and flows sweetly with a smooth rhythm. G.P.A has a voice worth listening to and he seems to have a firm grasp of the power of words. Highly recommended and I look forward to reading more from this author.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not happy with all the new advertising stuff that pops up constantly. I loved it before it became so commercialized. It was more of a social media. Now it's all about the money,.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying [[ASIN:0988178532 Outview (The Inner Movement) Book 1]]I could't not read 'Outlin'. This is a great continuation of what's building up to be a classic fantasy series. 'Outlin' starts directly where 'Outview' left off and hurtles you along the story. Again filled with wonderful characters and great spiritual and fantasy concepts 'Outlin' leaves you gasping for air and eagerly awaiting the next thrilling installment.

I have seen the movie before on MTV or VH1, not sure which,but I feel very strongly that it was almost, if not the most, important event in the whole history of the 20th century. I want my grandkids to know about this historical event.<br />  The movie was delivered in a very safe and secure package. It was also at my door very quickly.I am extremely satisfied with the condition of the tapes and the box. It got to me as described!!!<br />  I would definitely recommend this seller for future purchases!!!!!! I give this seller an A+++++
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I love this movie, I grew up with it. Best movie I've seen in a long time. Not a movie to be taken lightly though.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is one of the best programs out there.  It is like a scifi western with a mix of comedy.  This could have easily been one of the top shows on TV had FOX not messed it up and then refuse to Joss a chance to fix it with a second season.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|Extremely interesting perspective. I know it is not super nice to say this since she was forced to endure so much discomfort, but having someone like her in a prison is like a grand social experiment. I was reading with rapt attention. I am very much a fan of Piper Kerman now. I feel like I know her an like her.

B004M3GDI4|5.0|This a a seriously bright head lamp. it is VERY bulky its true, but i think it more than makes up for that fact. Extremely bright, simple lighting optiops, no stupid flash setting, no stupid red light, just Spot, Flood, and combo.. It has a locking feature so it CAN'T turn on in your bag, It takes AAs which is SUPER nice for taveling in central or south america due to limited availability of AAAs.. All around one of my best buys this year
B005NGKMOU|5.0|I lived and taught school in Boliva from 2008-2011. While I was there, I went on a Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid horseback trip and visited most of the places shown in the movie.  Every few minutes I was yelling out; \\"I was there!  I saw that!\\"  Very cool! The logistics of making this movie must have been difficult. Bolivia is not an easy place to work. Very very corrupt and very extremely third world. And they're not on good terms with the U.S.<br /><br /> I'll have to get a copy of this movie and watch it occasionally when I get a little homesick.

B00CLL1UY6|4.0|Sebastian, the second book in Christoph Fischer's Three Nations Trilogy will steal the heart of readers almost immediately.  Young Sebastian, a misunderstood and bookish teenager, loses the lower part of his leg after an infection sets in and takes over.  With the support and the love of a kind-hearted nurse, Liesl, and a supportive grandfather, Oscar, Sebastian works to overcome his new handicap and manage the family business after his father is drafted to fight in World War I.  He eventually grows into his responsibilities but struggles with doubt and uncertainty as he tries to understand himself and, hopefully, find love.<br /><br />Fischer's first novel in the Three Nations Trilogy, \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiner's\\" is a tragic love story between a Jewish woman and a German man whose love and marriage crumbles during the onset of World War I.  In \\"Sebastian\\" Fischer goes back in time and over to Vienna, Austria to describe the life of a multi-generational Jewish family during the Golden Era of Vienna.  The Schrieber family are a lovable group of characters and realistically flawed.  Sebastian's father and grandfather worked incessantly to build a prosperous life for their family and have faced struggles as new competing businesses have moved in, the grandparents begin to experience failing health and then Sebastian loses his leg which adds additional expenses onto an already strained family budget.  Sebastian is a wonderfully written character.  Initially he keeps his spirits up and is determined to overcome the challenges of losing his leg but additional surgery, time off from school and his father being drafted into World War I all take a toll on the fragile young man.  As the struggles mount and the family experiences tragedy after tragedy Sebastian finds himself swimming in a sea of self-loathing despite the optimism of the people around him.  He continues to move forward but it's a constant struggle.  Most of the characters in Sebastian are well-imagined by Fischer although there are a few that seem to have been added in as an afterthought or merely to expand the cast.  They didn't detract from the story but they didn't add to the story either. They could have been omitted and the text would not have suffered.<br /><br />Sebastian reads a bit slow and stilted during the beginning of the novel.  It takes approximately 50 - 70 pages before Fischer finds his voice and the novel hits its stride.  It isn't a challenging read in the beginning but with so many personalities and story to set-up the flow is a bit disjointed.  Once it begins moving along and the story grows the reader will find themselves entranced!  The historical details are beautifully told.  Fischer is a very talented wordsmith and, with Sebastian, has written two enthralling historical fiction novels.  I have yet to read the third novel in the Three Nations Trilogy but if the first two novels are any indication it will also be a must-read!<br /><br />Review by Ashley LaMar<br />Closed the Covery Fischer although there are a few that seem to have been added in as an afterthought or merely to expand the cast.

B008NQYWC0|5.0|As Stephan king described the past in 11/22/63 I felt as though I was there with the main character. He not only described how neat it would be to go back in time he also described the frustration of doing so. In other words one could feel the unrewrding aspect of lesser medical availibility along with a stifled socialogical points of view compared to how we act today.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I beat the game in only a few hours. It was not very challenging except for the one puzzle that didn't follow the clue... -.- most of my time was spent on that one puzzle. I was really looking forward to a few days worth of gameplay. Oh well. When the sequel come out I will be getting that. I just hope its a bit longer.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|First start with story...., than bad performance from Jon T. You don't believe him and he is not defensing the gay what he is playing. De Niro is making this movie interesting but everything round him is bad. Only good thing in the movie was the view from the top of the mountain where they hunt and.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when I boaght the game I didn't know how to play but after time I learned more it's as some
B00821OX98|5.0|I like that this series grabs you right from the beginning. When an episode ends I can't stop. I keep moving onto the next one.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|If you love Star Wars, and angry birds, this is the game for you. I totally recommend it for you.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this game!!!!! I am so addicted to it!!! I already live the minions, but it's even better with their cute sounds effects and different costumes!! Everyone needs to get this game NOW!!!! It's the best thing u could ever get!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|If you like Mario Bros. you will like this. Fun and entertaining, was sad to see it end. Worth the download.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love love love kik!!! It's the absolute best!!! I love that I can make my own comics and can send them to my friends. U can upload pictures and videos to your friends which I love. It's just a great app and I love it, I think everyone should get it
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I like Cinderella stories, but I really like the perspective they tell this one from. She is a very strong woman even after all the abuse she has to experience.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game is a great sequel to the first game. I think this game is pretty cool now that you can launch the pigs out of the slingshot. Definitely worth the dollar. I can't wait for the next levels. Enjoy the game :)
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had trouble getting into the story, and when I finslly got interrested, the book ended coldly without a resolution. I was angry, and if this was a physical book, I would have thrown it into the trash. I will never read any other book from this author. What a waste of time.

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|It has some stupid crap, but not as gratuitous as most TV offerings. It actually has a story line and some, not much, character development.

B001NA6096|5.0|Saw Before Midnight this summer and decided to see Before Sunrise (which I had seen years ago), followed by Before Sunset (which I hadn't seen before).  Linklater has created a truly great work of art with this trilogy.  The characters seem authentic and the settings are beautiful.  A much needed antidote to the drivel that Hollywood passes off as &#34;romantic comedies.&#34;

This record ties in to their first album in a way I never thought would be possible.  I'm really glad they got together to put some more music out.  They talk about the issues at hand today in a way no one else can...
B005IS56CG|5.0|I love the energy of FFDP Very few bands can stand with these guys.<br />The emotion in the lyrics is raw. The music is powerful.<br />Nobody does it better!!!! Keep it up guys you rock.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Bought this blueray quite some time now.<br />The way it was conceived, excellent.<br />First the artist solo. And as the concert progress, musicians are added to the presentation.<br />John Mayer give us a demonstration of control, virtuosity and good taste in every song.<br />He is so good that it doesn't bother me his cockyness.<br />I give 3.5 stars to the image, but the sound mastering is A plus.<br />You'll spend well your money if you buy this one.<br />Recomended.
0385349947|4.0|Quick read. She makes you think about your own place at work as she shares her own stories. Good book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this game for a couple years now so can really recommend it.  Sometimes  it's a real  challenge but not enough that it is discouraging<br />Don't hesitate to try it.
B000000OU0|5.0|Great Eagles CD, play it over and over and never get tired of it.  Timeless music, never goes out of style.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|muy buena
B009NY43NY|1.0|I learned to forgive many of the author's foibles, such as rehashing past story lines (at length and without trusting that fans knew her characters pretty well) and presenting a deus ex machina in tight spots. I even forgave how hard Sookie's personality became toward the end of the series. And I was one that did not feel the love story element of the novels followed a logical course. Bill was her perfect other half, they should have found their way back to each other. This book could have been so much more satisfying. I wish she had done something brave, like turning Sookie into a vampire, then for a time being able to see the other side of that life from Sookie's eyes (then she could have used the cluviel dor to turn herself back) - it would have been a far more interesting end than to witness her being abused, used, misused, cast aside; and then end up in a relationship that seemed very wrong to type. I suggest to any reader who has come this far to finish what you started, but be prepared for disappointment.

B009LQKHIO|4.0|Pride is a small town and this novel introduces us to some of its citizens. It is a delightful story of survival and romance. It makes you feel in your gut the emotions of the characters  dottiek
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's easy enough early on but provides a good amount of challenge later on. It's a great way to kill some time but be careful you don't forget what you were waiting to do! Love this game<br />definitely recommend for all ages and skill levels.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is amazing and I've been recommending it to anyone who loves a great story that is written fantastically full of great characters!  Read it!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Not very interesting drawn out and lacks fluidity.  Do not recommend unless you like a boring read. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it!!! Awesome book! I'm excited to read what's next! The book was well written and plenty of action throughout the whole book!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I find all of Ken Follett's books to be absolute page-turners.  Never be daunted by what seems like an epic novel.  I speed through his stuff because its always riveting.  I've even suggested to a history teacher I work with to get this book and have his AP US History students read certain pieces of it alongside the factual stuff they read about this era.  It's like living the history instead of just getting the filtered facts.  I'm going to buy the second book of the trilogy right now.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|It was a good easy read but the characters were so similar to 50 shades it was a little annoying. Once the story line got going I couldn't put it down.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This is one of the BEST two shows on television, the other being Game of Thrones. Each episode is better and more expertly done than most movies. If you haven't seen this show yet, you need to get this set as well as seasons one and two. And for the price (about $15 to $20 a season), this is a no brainer. Just get them and thank me later.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I ordered this series on a rainy weekend to catch up on all the Downton series so I could converse with friends who had been watching it.  It was easy to download with a Roku.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the content of the book and the way it flowed through to the end.  It was a great book that I could not put down.
B003Y5D776|5.0|don't waste your money on cheaper alternatives that don't work at the end. This one does the job and does what it promised to do.

B008NW67E0|5.0|I may not love this album as much as I loved Sign No More, it is still incredible music and worth every penny!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is a blast to play! The one major gripe I have is the hours of game play I've lost. I frequently have to redo missions. The most annoying thing is losing coins and progress. The game is awesome but I may still give up on it because of this flaw.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|GAME IS ENTERTAINING,I JUST STARTED IT,I'M INTERESTED TO SEE THE END,THE PUZZLES ARE KIND OF HARD,BUT I LIKE A CHALLENGE..

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Everyone should have this dictionary at their fingertips.  Besides helping you spell a work, helps pronounce the word, define it.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|I can stream media or copy any file from SD, USB, and even external HDs to my iPad. And if you read the instructions carefully, you can copy files from the iPad to the MobileLite without any additional software. I can also copy non-standard iPad files like .avi files as well and play them with a 3rd party media player. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little big and a little slow.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Excellent read.  I still hate Steve Jobs, and the book only confirmed my dislike for him.  It actually added more reasons to dislike him.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I love being inside Drew Evans head! What a ride! A must read... I am definitely going to buy in print.
B000I8HIR2|4.0|I watched Silent Hill Revelation first and then this one.  I gave this one 4 because I liked Revelation just slightly more due to the improvements of the monsters! Just a great entertaining movie with little/no foul language.  I wasn't embarrassed to have my 10/12 year old watch it.  It's hard to find a really good horror show and this is definately one of them!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|You guys, I've gone and done it again... I've fallen in love with Rainbow Rowell's characters and their stories. There's so much I love about this book (like, every. single. thing. about it) and I'm going to try not to gush. Too much. I don't feel like I can truly do this book justice with a review, but I'm going to try.<br /><br />\\"To really be a nerd, she'd decided, you had to prefer fictional worlds to the real one.\\"<br /><br />Cath is a nerd. She writes slash fan fiction about Simon Snow, boy magician, using the name Magicath. She's such a Simon Snow fan and writes such complex fan fic, she has a fan base of her own. She's a big deal in certain circles online. Real life is a little different. She's insecure and lives in the shadow of her twin sister, Wren. While Wren likes to party, chase boys and experience all life has to offer, for better or worse, Cath is more reserved. She'd much rather spend the night writing and fostering her online friendships than hanging out at parties or in bars. She's so introverted at times that it's almost painful. But, she's an easy character to identify with. She's as awkward as can be, but she's lovable, strong and smart. She's loyal to those she's closest to, even when they might not deserve it. She's completely adorkable. I loved her almost immediately, but \\"Emergency Kanye Party\\" solidified it for me.<br /><br />\\"There are other people on the Internet. It's awesome. You get all the benefits of `other people' without the body odor and the eye contact.\\"<br /><br />Cath and Wren head off to their new lives in college at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For the first time in their lives, they won't be living together. It's time for each of them to experience life without being a crutch for the other. Cath's new roommate, Reagan, is pretty much her polar opposite. She's a partier. She's always out with a different guy, despite the fact that Levi is always hanging out in her room. Cath assumes they're dating, but the truth is more complicated than that. Somewhere along the way, Levi becomes more than \\"Reagan's friend.\\" He's Cath's friend and confidant. He's there for her. Their chemistry is strong and sweet.<br /><br />\\"Oh, put that away,\\" Cath said with distaste. \\"I don't want you to get charm all over my sister - what if we can't get it out?\\"<br /><br />\\"She didn't have words for what Levi was. He was a cave painting. He was The Red Balloon. She lifted her heels and pulled him forward until his face was so close, she could look at only one of his eyes at a time. \\"You're magic,\\" she said.<br /><br />I adored Levi from the moment he appeared on the pages. He's an adorable farm boy. He's sweet and thoughtful. He always went out of his way to try to include Cath, despite being turned down again and again. There was more to him than met the eye, as Cath began to find out. When he began meeting her at the library to walk her home from study \\"dates\\" with her classmate, Nick, I started to hope there was a glimmer of something more there.<br /><br />\\"Cath liked Levi. A lot. She liked looking at him. She liked listening to him - though sometimes she hated listening to him talk to other people. She hated the way he passed out smiles to everyone he met like it didn't cost him anything, like he'd never run out. He made everything look so easy... \\"<br /><br />As you might expect, Cath was completely out of her element at college. She was so uncomfortable in new situations that she was afraid to try to find the dining hall, so she was more or less living off energy bars. Reagan and Levi finally force her somewhat out of her comfort zone and get her out and about. For a girl with very little social life, Cath has the attention of several guys. Throughout the story there's Able, her quasi-boyfriend from home, her study-date/writing-partner Nick, and Levi. I'll let you find out for yourself how that all shakes out though. There's so many sweet, swoon-worthy scenes and good, old-fashioned teenage angst that you need to experience it all for yourself.<br /><br />\\"Apparently, I'm good for something,\\" Wren said. \\"You keep stealing all my best lines.\\"<br /><br />Wren is a minor character in the majority of the book, at least in a physical sense. She's not around very often. She's off doing her own thing, leaving Cath to live her own life. To find herself. While they shared some of the same friends and interests pre-college, I'm not entirely sure Wren and Cath could be any different. They each went through a lot in this novel. I think they both wound up stronger and better because of the events that occurred though. I think their relationship with each other, while different than it was when they left for school, became more solid, too. It wasn't an easy road though.<br /><br />\\"I feel like... what happened last night was just an aberration. Like it could only have happened in the middle of the night, when he and I were both really tired. Because if it had been daylight, we would have seen how inappropriate it was -\\"<br /><br />\\"How do you feel when I smile at you?\\" he asked - and then he did smile at her, just a little.<br />\\"Like an idiot,\\" she said softly. \\"And like I never want it to stop.\\"<br /><br />The romance in this book was absolutely swoon-worthy in that way only young adult books can be. It was sweet and innocent. It just made me smile. I was absolutely charmed by nearly every character in this book. At the end, despite the fact that there wasn't a cliffhanger and really, everything was resolved, I was in no way ready to give these characters up. I've had such a book hangover from them it's been nearly impossible to think about writing this review.<br /><br />\\"I feel sorry for you, and I'm going to be your friend.\\"<br /><br />\\"But you're so helpless sometimes. It's like watching a kitten with its head trapped in a Kleenex box.\\"<br /><br />Whether they're main or secondary, Rainbow Rowell writes amazing characters. They're real. I want to know them personally. By the end of the book, I feel like I do know them. This book was absolutely no exception. Reagan was just what Cath needed in a roommate. She was sassy and outgoing. She pushed Cath. She helped her grow. I want her to be my friend. Professor Piper also helped Cath come into her own. She was everything a professor should be. She was supportive, but she still pushed her. Cath became a better writer because of it. Cath's father was another favorite. He was complicated. He had issues. But, he was a great dad. I loved their banter.<br /><br />\\"But it's just so good. Nobody writes Simon and Baz like Magicath. I'm in love with her Baz. Like, in love. And I used to be a major Simon/Agatha shipper.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sometimes...,\\" Cath said, \\"when I'm reading canon, I forget that Simon and Baz aren't in love.\\"<br /><br />One of the things I loved most about this book was the way that Rowell integrated the fan fiction so well with Cath's real life story. This is something most authors couldn't pull off, but she does it absolutely flawlessly. First of all, I just loved reading the Simon Snow stories. It took me back to the days where I would read a TON of Harry Potter fan fiction to get through the excruciating wait between books. I read more Harry/Draco slash than I should probably admit. (Don't judge me.) I loved seeing what the fan fic writers did with J.K. Rowling's characters in an alternate universe. I enjoyed reading what Cath did with Simon and Baz in her stories. The world-building in the fan fic and the Simon Snow \\"book\\" chapters was wonderful. Complex. It made me wish Gemma T. Leslie and her books were real. I also loved that Cath's writing in the fan fic world closely mirrored what was happening in her real life. The details about Cath's on-campus life were incredible, too. I felt like I was with her. I actually have a good friend who went to school at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and he was in awe of the details I was describing from the boo\\"But there's nothing moreprofound than creating something out of nothing.\\" Her lovely face turned fierce. \\"Think about it, Cath. That's what makes a god - or a mother. There's nothing more intoxicating than creating something from nothing. Creating something from yourself.\\"<br /><br />This is a beautiful coming-of-age story. It's about growing up and finding yourself while trying not to lose all the things (and people) who have made you YOU so far. It's about learning how to accept new people into your life, while not isolating those who have been there for years. It's about family and friends, crushes and love. It made me feel like I was a college freshman again. The situations were *that* real. The characters were charming and believable. The dialogue ranged from witty to sweet to teasing to moving and it was sheer perfection. I went through the whole gamut of emotions while reading this book. I was in Cath's corner the entire time.<br /><br />\\"When you break from behind the tree, it's because you want to. It's the first breath after a long dive. Branches snap under your feet, and the world is hotter and brighter. Ready or not, here I come. Here I come, ready or not.\\"he end of the book, I feel like I do know them.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|We love this soundtrack, but the our cd player struggles with the black disc. Glad to have the digital copy included automatically (cloud player).
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a lovely game.  I have enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing game to pass the time.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Exciting, crazy war, surprising deaths. Definitely a fun read, but a long one. Great getting more in depth with the lesser players.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|No comparison to Arnold's original. Not sure the point of why they even remade this movie. Thank God it was free! Story line was hollow. Climax of the end was a flop! Don't waste your time. Just watch the original!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|If you enjoy dan browns style of storytelling you will enjoy this. If you dont you will not make it to the exciting end!
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I went great lengths to get this doll-I woke up at 5:45 on Friday the 13th and ordered her from Target.com. She was $25, which is the retail price at most stores. She is very superstitious, and her outfit is based on that fact. Catty's dress has a broken mirror top with the number 13 by the shoulder, and one black sleeve above that. The skirt is high/low, going past her feet at the bottom. The first layer is pink, the second layer is pink fish-net with pink sparkly circles, and the top layer is the same except that it has white circles. At the very top of the skirt, there is a little piece of white fish-net where the top meets the bottom. The back of the skirt is intentionally ripped, so don't be worried when your doll comes looking that way. Catty's four bracelets are one silver, and three pink with spikes, and the one on her left arm has a bell on it, sort of like a collar. Her necklace is meant to look like a broken mirror, and has another 13 in the middle of it (you have to look very closely). Catty has three ear piercings; the two on the right have pink hoops like Clawdeen's, and the left ear has a pink 13. Her silver boots are also broken mirrors, and have no heel and a platform. They come off strangely, though. Instead of being cut down the back, you have to pull them apart and then put them back together, which I hate doing.<br /><br />Catty is the first all-black werecat, and her body is great. Her hands are one of Howleen's and one of Rochelle's and Clawdeen's. The middle of her ears are light pink, and her hair is all pink. I had no trouble with \\"box hair\\" as it is pulled into a high ponytail.  Her bangs are tied at the sides of her face, which looks cute. The tail is also great and it stays in very well. Her only accessory is a pink microphone, which is very detailed. Her stand is the newer model, which I love. It holds the doll up by their hip area instead of their chest area. It works really well. Lately, Mattel has been doing a horrible job releasingtheir dolls, though. I saw people selling this doll in August, and the pictures for some of the 2014 dolls are already out. Also, this doll seems a bit overpriced. The only accessory is her microphone (but the dress is amazing), and the shoes are kind of, yes, cheap. (I thought I'd never say that, but it is sort of true.) I love this doll, though, but I'd recommend that you get it soon, because I am almost certain that the price will rocket by the holidays.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Couldn't stop reading... I would recommend this to everyone as it's just the saddest yet most wonderful book ever written.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This was better than we thought it would be. The acting & story line was pretty good...and with Sam Shepard, how could you go wrong.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The flow of the story is good, and yes I would recommend this book  to someone that likes  a good suspense story.

B00CATSONE|3.0|Very informative. Science obviously was never immune from effects of big buisiness and politics-even in the 19th century.<br />However, the book is not a complete biography and one is left wanting to know more about the persona of Nikola Tesla.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was awesome.  It has sci go, video games, comic books, movies, computer games music all from the 80's.  The story is fast pace and filled with creative action and adventure.

B00B4FU6KE|3.0|My friend recommended this book for our book club and I agree with her on that.  It is a book that gives you a weird feeling of who you are and knowing the similarities of the human and the ape.  That is a book that is completely outside of my comfort zone, however, am happy to have read it and will recommend it for my book club reading.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|Highly detailed and the paint job is excellence, but it does not surprise me, coming from Kotobukiya. I've bought several items from them and I never had a issue. I think any batman or justice league fan will love it.

B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I have a terrible time getting connected to even try to use Nemo's Reef and at this point can't say I have had the pleasure of experiencing it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love it!  I wish the energy would recharge faster though... very addicting! There are so many different tasks and challenges... it requires dedication to accomplish all of them, I'm always looking forward to the next one!

1250030951|5.0|Cath writes fanfic. Her and her twin sister Wren head off to college and Wren decides she wants more space. She doesn't want to be just a twin. Cath wants to keep writing Carry On, Simon and she really wants her sister to be her friend again. What she doesn't expect is a roommate that she doesn't mind, or a boy that she starts to like. What she doesn't expect is that maybe there is more in life than Simon and Baz.<br /><br />My first question is: Why are there 30 more pages in the hardcover? I guess this is just a ploy to get me to re-read it. This ploy is inevitably going to work so...yeah.<br /><br />I loved this book though. LOVED it. I read it so slowly, as slowly as I could stand. I just wanted to savor it for as long as I could. The last few chapters I rushed through though, because I wanted to see what happened to the characters.<br /><br />I loved Cath. She was such a real character. She and I could be friends if either of us were any good at making friends. Then there was Wren. I didn't much care for her. Why was she so daft? There was Nick and Levi too, except let's not talk about Nick. Levi seemed like a lot of fun. I appreciate that he wasn't overly romanticized. Sometimes it's really nice to have a real person to fall in love with instead of a super human. Reagan was surly but a good person. I appreciate her character and how she interacts with everyone else. Rainbow Rowell just has a way of writing very realistic characters that I can relate to and love or hate.<br /><br />This was a great story about finding who you are when you don't have anyone holding your hand every step of the way. It's also about letting things go and being happy. Cath isn't perfect and she will never be, but slowly she can let herself be happy.<br /><br />I loved the Fanfic part of this. I have never read any fan fiction, but I can definitely see the appeal. I think I'm going to need some fan fiction for Fangirl. I'm not ready to be done with these characters. I want to see them re-imagined to death. I want different scenarios for them and I want the outcome that I wanted. I can see why Cath was so obsessed with Carry On, Simon. I am in love with this book. I only had these characters for 400 pages or less, but already I want more of them forever.<br /><br />If you haven't read anything by Rainbow Rowell, I'm not sure what you are waiting for. She is completely brilliant and I can't wait to get my hands on more novels by her. Do yourself a favor and go out and by this one.

B007STBUIW|5.0|I'm a big fan of this film like all fans of Jaws<br />and is still a Huge classic after all these years, brilliant script, Great Acting and Directing<br />and of course the music score that stands the test of time<br />i have the 30th Anniversary edition DVD release like all fans<br />but when i found out about a new Documentary called THE SHARK IS STILL WORKING i knew i had to get it<br />but i found out that this new Doco is only available on the Blu-ray release as an exclusive<br />so it's not available on the DVD releases<br />so i bought this blu-ray just to watch the new Documentary actually.<br /><br />so when i bought it, i only watched the new Doco called the Shark is still working<br />which is a Legacy and Impact Doco of Jaws<br />and the Documentary is incredible and goes for about 2hrs<br />this new Documentary is even better than the 2hr Making of Documentary released in the late 90'S on LaserDisc<br />which was released on the 30th Anniversary edition DVD anyway.<br />the new Doco is fantastic just about every actor/actress from the film is interviewed<br />even the actors that have small parts in the film, there's interviews with fans, critics<br />the D.O.P, the Producers David brown and Richard Zanuck that have passed away now<br />there's TV footage of the Jaws-fest conventions and the List goes on<br />Jaws 2 and Jaws 3,4 are mentioned briefly<br />as a fan i love Jaws 2 aswell i think it's just as Good as the first one<br />excellent Directed by french directer Jeannot Szwarc so Jaws 2 is equally as Good as Jaws 1<br />and who knows if Jaws 2 will ever get a blu-ray release it's anybody's guess<br />but this new Doco mainly focuses on the original Jaws film not really the sequels<br /><br />all the special features from the 30th Anniversary edition dvd are on this Blu-ray aswell<br />Deleted scenes, outtakes, From the set which is rare on set interviews from 1974 etc<br />so you might aswell throw the DVD out and just watch the Blu-ray.<br /><br/>while i had this Blu-ray i thought i might aswell watch the film<br />even thou i'd seen it many times on my 30th anniversary edition DVD<br /><br />i was absolutely amazed at how good the blu-ray picture and Audio quality was<br />the picture was so clean and crisp with bright/beautifull colours<br />and the audio quality is fantastic, it's been remixed into 7.1 sound<br />the picture and audio looks and sounds like a new release film produced with today's best tech available<br />Universal really did put the Hard work into restoring this film no Doubt about it<br />with all new 7.1 surround sound and better picture quality of the film than the DVD release<br /><br />this blu-ray is Definitely worth the money, there's no point keeping the 30th anniversary dvd<br />cause every single extra/featurette, Deleted scenes etc are on this blu-ray.<br />i gave this blu-ray 5 stars, not only is the film's quality incredible but all the Documentaries<br />featurettes etc are on this blu-ray aswell.

B0083DJUMA|5.0|A really great book that shows you the possibilities of personal fabrication. This book goes into great detail about how new technology impacts manufacturing. It also shows the impacts of democratizing certain manufacturing and prototyping technologies like 3D printing. I'm almost certain you'll enjoy this book.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|30 years into her illustrious career, there's nothing much else to say or prove. Watch the MDNA Tour on Blu-Ray (my copy is perfectly fine, image or audio-wise) and you will know the kind of showmanship that this one-woman wonder is associated with. Once on the stage whether belting out old tunes or new, the stage is hers. While others often say people only pay to watch Madonna perform her old hits, I beg to differ. Madonna's catalog is so vast that a 2-hour show will not be able to accommodate but she expertly weaves in elements of old songs into her new songs and the majority of MDNA is sung here. Look carefully - her fans are able to sing her new songs, which have an added dynamism live, too. There's no doubt this woman sings live too - watch Like a Virgin Waltz and Like A Prayer where she borrows the voices of her fans on many lines. Last but not least, I am utterly amazed at the energy this woman possesses and how she contorts her body almost like a seasoned gymnast to perform! If any of today's female artistes can take their careers this far, they can take away her throne. In the meantime, Madonna is QUEEN!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|We read the other three books in the series. A little far fetched and, at times, a little brutal but a good story.  I would be careful what age group would read this.
B004I744AS|5.0|I found this app to be fast, efficient, and quite useful with the built in audio feature.  It makes working on word documents easier than going online to find the word through a search engine.  I can launch this app and then reopen my word document without having to pay for a built in dictionary and spell checker.  Great app!!

B009C7JS14|5.0|I like this app because it's weather at the tap of my finger. No waiting for ads to load, I don't have to click on separate buttons to see other information. It's all on one page. Very nice,very convenient!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a pretty good book it started slow but it took off toward the middle I enjoyed reading it. I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is quite a very good game. I play everyday now and it is fun, I strongly recommend it, especially if you like strategy games.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I hate alarm clocks, I mean common! Who doesn't? But this one if super cool!!!! If you have music on your kindle Fire, you can have your alarm set to your favourite songs! You can also change the design of the clock. It it totally worth the &cent;99/coins. This would be my second day using it and I am already telling friends about it. It is perfect!!!<br />(\_/)<br />( &deg;&middot;&deg;)<br />(u u)*
B004KZDV8E|3.0|I wish I would have gotten an i5 but its okay, this guy works just fine. Let me keep my first gaming rig under $800. I
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it<br />Now  I need something else to fulfill my lunchtime reading hour!! I could feel their emotions, no complaints from me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when I was wondering what all the hype was about with this book, I got to the part where it suddenly got really interesting. I appreciate the thought put into developing an intriguing story with a couple of very smart (but messed up) characters.
0062215507|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my sister. She is a Harry Portter fanatic.  I came across this book at the Harry Potter Store Whismical Alley, here in LA.  There was a sample that you can flip through.  The pictures were amazing and the details it gave about the Harry Potter books, movies were simply amazing.  Long story short, my sister could not stop raving about this book, she said that it also came with the Harry potter map and other Harry Potter stuff.  So from all her raving I gave it a 5 star review.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I always enjoy movie scores, and this one is amazing.  I loved the movie, and the soundtrack just fits into my collection so well. I am really glad I made the purchase.  My 19 year old son listened to it too, and loved it.
0439023513|5.0|I enjoyed it, you needed to finish it to see how it ended. The second book that goes with the series was too much, she should of had just 2 books.<br />Good for children 12 and older.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|I love Jack Johnson! This cd is great! It reminds me of why I fell in love with his music in the first place. Songs are catchy, upbeat and always full of love. Definitely recommended.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It is funny and exciting but sad it is an awesome chick flick  I would watch it over and over is how good it is.,
159463176X|3.0|Was an ok book. I enjoy reading about Afghanistan and the middle east when it was a beautiful and peaceful place. I do think the story was all too familiar having read Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. The characters are similar and stories seem recycled. I prefer Kite Runner to them all but, I did read that one first.
0802473156|1.0|The book seems more like a vessel for religious ideology than for actual helpful information  The moment the author gets close to explaining something interesting about how humans love in all the different ways and express ourselves to each other, it dives right back into godbibleversejesus etc.<br /><br />Skip this and check out Books like &#34;Sex at Dawn&#34; or &#34;A Billion Wicked Thoughts&#34; and you'll learn much more about how we think and express ourselves romantically and how men and women REALLY think.<br /><br />Pass on this.
0451197879|4.0|I liked the book in that it was more<br />the story of a mans  spiral down into<br />mental decline. That said, I'm a big fan<br />of mental decline.
B00DIMXTBO|2.0|This book just didn't do it for me. The first book dragged and I don't know why I bought this one--I guess there were enough interesting ideas to make me take the gamble with my time...  The writing didn't get any less disappointing, though.<br />I'm 3/4 through and I don't think I'm going to finish...
B008TRH5N6|5.0|The truths expressed in the book at timeless and beneficial to all. This is a must read for you and yours!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I just finished the book today.  I truly think that everyone should read it.  Amazing, funny, deep, practical: a gift to the planet.  I am getting ready to read it for the second time!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just download and you'll see yourselves. It was worth the time by far. I Look forward to more rooms!! Had a lot of fun.
0345803493|4.0|Interesting in many ways!<br />  The book was almost impossible to put down. I couldn't imagine what Mr.Grey was going to come up with next! I am looking forward to the next and last book in the set. What comes after marriage!!!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I really love this book it has open our eyes to a lot of things we do in our life. & it has also made think about things in our past that could have been done differently, I recommend this book to everyone
B005HV6Y84|4.0|This was a stimulating listen as I drove a long distance car trip. The mix of classical music with up beat contemporary was uplifting, but not so much as to disturb my sleeping daughter in the back seat.<br />Sincerely enjoyable,<br />amazon.com/author/joyjohnsonwrit3r
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It had me from the start, and cried at the end.  Would recommend to everyone.  It's very different, but an easy read.
0375869026|5.0|A very good youth novel, about a boy born with a severe facial deformity who goes to public school for the first time in fifth grade. As you might imagine, he gets mistreated by some, befriended by others, and lessons are learned all around - but the book is never preachy or heavy handed. The author takes the risk of telling the story through several different voices (the boy, his sister, classmates, etc.), and succeeds beautifully - hard to believe this is a first novel, it's so unaffected and affecting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book!!! Great characters, great story!! Had me really feeling what they were feeling and caring about what was happening in their lives.
0307950654|3.0|This book proved to be a disappointingly flat trifle, albeit with a fun premise: a mystery plunked down into Jane Austen territory, in which a murder occurs on the Pemberley estate and upsets the tranquil married life of Elizabeth and Darcy. Surprisingly, given what a great mystery writer PD James is, the mystery story isn't very interesting - what's most engaging about the book is how James slips in a lot of plausible back story to aspects of  \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\"
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I stopped playing this game because the last objective at 10,000,000 meters has been very difficult. I am<br />On the verge of never playing this game again. I pick it back up after a few months and now find all these advertisements. I paid for this game. If you want to leave the ads on there, put me to level 10. Way to go to \\"temple ruin\\" a good thing
B009LQKHIO|3.0|The romance between Todd and Megan is sweet! But the start of the book is too slow for my taste! The characters think too much instead of interacting with each other, it becomes better as the story progresses.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was disappointed, there was such a hype about this book in the press. I stopped ready after the fifth chapter
B00280LYHS|4.0|I really enjoyed these and found them captivating. My wife liked the first one but the then the series begun feeling dragged out for her. I loved them them all but the movie was terrible , from an adult view point anyways.
B005UG542S|4.0|As with the first part of The Deathly Hallows, this one is truer to the books than some of the other movies.  While the first part is a bit slow as it builds a lot of the story, this one is full of action.  The characters are handled well and its a fun ride.  I highly recommend this one to fans of fantasy and Harry Potter.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This camera bag is inexpensive but works well for me. I'm able to carry all my camera gear with me. I have officially become a camera Geek!
B004WMKSH2|4.0|The Harry Potter books and movies were somewhat disappointing in the middle.  The movies of course cut out a lot of material and this really hurt the fifth and sixth movies.  The seventh movie, however, was a lot better at incorporating the major points from the book.  There are still some changes and omissions, but that's part of Hollywood.  The movie is an epic and entertaining ride and worth watching.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook has given me a chance to reconnect with family and friends from way back. I use it everyday and find it fascinating the many messages, pictures and articles people share with me.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started. Golf solitaire with a real golf twist. Pretty funny cutscenes to explain the gophers plight. Great game.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I have found the v-Tube-viewrer and downloader for my Kindle to be incredibly enjoyable and fascinating to hear the ole tunes..
B004DLPXAO|5.0|for someone who cannot afford a kindle, put this on your phone and its the next best thing. Have a look
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Shipment was quicker then expected, Couldn't beat the price. Although you can't help but compare this to Phantom of the Opera, it was a seperate show in itself. It is something I wish was out at the theater, The colorful costumes, the music, well worth watching over and over.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|Bought this to keep my daughter busy when needed. It is fine but not too many options that make it any different from a paint game that has been on every PC I have bought that came for free. I think I will try this on the PC to see if it works better, some apps do. I use this on my tablet.
B0000797IO|4.0|I love this movie for its intelligent screenplay, offbeat and interesting characters, and a lovely performance by Jennifer Aniston. It has a lot to it, and can be watched over and over again. I am divided as to whether or not Hollywood was smirking at small town USA, or sympathizing with it, or a bit of both.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|She loves the movies and like most children these days, is very familiar with games. She is 7 and just found it too difficult. She can play games like Minecraft that I personally think are more challenging but this game she can't seem to get. I will try again in a few months, you never know!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Since downloading this game I have not been able to put it down. I have no problem recommending this game.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Awesome book, story is well written and historically accurate. Mr. Riordan has done it again to create an epic tale of mythic proportions
B008I3R2VG|5.0|Brandon Flowers has an amazing voice and is an incredible song writer, I love this album! Miss Atomic Bomb is a great song!
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|I took my 2 year old to see this twice. He is a huge cars fan so I thought what the heck he will love this.....was I ever so right!! Not only did he sit still the entire movie, I too enjoyed it as well. Would definitely recommend this to any Disney/Pixar collector!!!
0061906220|5.0|This book is absolutely addictive!  You find yourself singing Pete's song, even when you are'nt reading the book with the kids!  It's all good!!!  Loved it!!!!!

B00A6L78TY|5.0|\\"Is this what it was like hearing the Rolling Stones for the first time in the early 60's?\\" -- *Actual thought that ran through my brains while listening to Foxygen's 7-song July `12 release Take the Kids Off Broadway.  Managing to pull of an intensely pleasurable blend of 60's rock a la Stones, Beatles and Bowie with the modern psychedelic-trimmings of Tame Impala, I shook my head at the raw talent, both musically and creatively, running through the veins of the L.A. duo and prayed that they wouldn't screw it up with their follow-up.<br /><br />\\"Good, they didn't screw it up....yeah, this is really good\\" -- *Second actual thought that ran through my brains after listening to We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Magic & Peace.  Simply put, if you like rock even slightly you owe it to yourself to experience the musical goodness oozing out of a band that will no doubt turn heads in coming years.  If the duo can quit canceling shows and avoid burnout, there's a decent chance your kids might one day ask what it was like hearing Foxygen for the first time way back in 2013.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book is a departure from Harry Potter.  It was a bit raunchy but maybe the author was trying to write something entirely different.
B00BB22GSU|5.0|It's hard to think about Vampire Weekend without some sort of collegial association. This angers me because I know the whole thing is overblown, yet it's tough to shake the music media mind morph. Fans and critics of their 2008 debut each zeroed in on the boat-shoed Ivy League air that flowed through their music; fans lauding them for putting their brains to use in their songwriting, critics dismissing them with vague accusations of yacht club elitism. Regardless, the college vibe flowing through their debut was distinctly undergraduate. It was easy to imagine them playing these songs in the quad while philosophy students drunkenly debated reality next to the Zeta Tau bake sale.<br /><br />Their third studio album, on the other hand, is the band's PhD theses -- their 10,000 hours album.  Leaving behind the Afro-pop cheekiness of their youth they create a sound that is more round and ear-pleasing, while still retaining the lyrical sharpness and instrumental complexity that softens even the most critical listeners.  Songs like \\"Step\\" \\"Hannah Hunt\\" and \\"Ya Hey\\" are all songs that ordinary bands could hang a career on, yet in the context of the album they show up simply as slightly brighter stars in a large constellation.  After their first two albums it was still possible to debate with some credibility the overall merits of the band...with this album one can make a cocktail, put the record on the platter and drink to the fact that the debate is over, they're good.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I am reading this and plan to recommend it for my book club to read.  I am finding it a little predictable but it is a good read.
B003AIEOCY|5.0|Few albums in music history so completely sum up a genre of music as Exile On Main St. did for rock & roll upon its release in 1972.  Rebellion, check. On the run from the taxman the band wrote and recorded a large portion of the album in the basement of rented villa in southern France. Drugs, check. Lots of heroine. Love, check. Mick Jagger got married during the making of the album. What makes Exile on Main St so head-shakingly good, however, is its magnetic pull on all the rock & roll influences up to that point in history.<br /><br />The band originally formed around its affinity for American bluesmen like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and early rock & roll pioneers like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. Covering many of these artists in the early days, Exile is where you see the band taking what they've learned and expertly creating their own variations on the theme.  Guitarist, Keith Richards, was in peak form and in his words was using, \\"...five-string, open tuning to the max.\\" A double album's worth of classic, hip-shaking rock -- one of the greatest albums ever made.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  It not my usual genre, but it is always good to go out of one's comfort zone.
B00DKY4NBA|5.0|After a somewhat wobbly last album, the Arctic Monkeys are not only back in their groove, but, like Vampire Weekend earlier this year, seem to be hitting their ultimate stride.  Filled with a glittery mixture of glam rock, doo wop, and 90's hip hop, this is an album that will tickle even the most critical ear.  As a friend of mine said, \\"You could play most of these songs at a stadium and people would stomp and clap even if they had no idea who it was.\\"  The A side is filled with hit after hit and the B side finds a seductive groove that will keep many a party going into the wee hours of the night...all the way to the \\"AM.\\"  Undoubtedly one of the top albums of 2013 - a must-have for any music lover.
B006PZBRCY|4.0|An enjoyable movie from beginning to end. The ending was surprising for what could have been a run of the mill feel good movie.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This was a gift for my wife and it was so much cheaper than the box stores retail. Arrived in real new retail packaging and is not a knock off
096798467X|4.0|Great book for backyard construction.  Walks you thru the entire construction process and explains why certain materials are used vs. others.  Follow the guide and you'll be happy with the oven.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Would definitely recommend the book. It was a quick read - you couldn't put it down, even though you might not like the characters.
1118109791|4.0|As a starter, I found it very useful. It gets you familiar to the exam by the questions which were asked in the previous exams. I would recommend this book if you are starter, cause it is very good resource to learn the basic framework of the exam.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Addicted to this fun game.... can't seem to put it down. GREAT game!!!! Much fun. You have pay attention to all of your surroundings
B004UJAOLM|3.0|The book wuthering heights was not that good of a book. i had to read it for class and it kinda sucked. i would def not reccomend it for anyone else.

B007URVZJ6|3.0|I down loaded this by accident I wasn't planning on writing a book.  But I will find time to look it over at another time later.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I had the original album but over the years it hot misplaced or left behind in a move.  I was very pleased to be able to get one of my favorite album's of all time again.  SEGAR ROCKS!!!!!
B004EF65QA|5.0|North and South was Excellent as I expected. It was not until the 4th Episode that I realized I must have seen it years ago because I knew what was going to happen in a couple of scenes, British fare is not predictable.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Man it's good cool and so fuuun the all u have to do is search something like an app that will download
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|SO, SO SAD TO HAVE FINISHED THE LAST BOOK AND NOW, OH WHAT TO DO, OH WHAT TO READ, WHY COULD THERE NOT BE JUST ONE MORE STORY WITH \\"THE GIRL\\"?
B00E34A9FU|5.0|This date has always been on the relatively short list of greatest Grateful Dead shows, but we've only had various unofficial \\"tapes\\" to judge it by. Now, after listening to it both soft and loud, it's obviously a no-brainer to buy. All the great moments of the show - the China Cat break into Rider, the zooming Playing in the Band, the mournful Sing Me Back Home (these last two now reaffirmed as the definitive versions) and of course the thoughtful considered Dark Star - are all wonderful to hear in their full sonic glory. This was one of those days, too, where all the members of the band were really really really listening to each other - the characteristic that most defines the Dead and sets them apart.<br /><br />But I'm also struck for the first time that the intensity comes and goes a bit. Was it the heat? It seems at times that within some of the songs and even in some of the song selection they're thinking about conserving resources. Compare this show with one of the other contenders for \\"best ever\\" - Dick's Picks #8, May 2, 1970. The sonic qualities of 8/27 as a recording are clearly better, and probably so is the musical complexity - remember, they essentially have an additional instrumentalist in '72 - although this is quibbling. But 5/2 is just INTENSE, sharp, almost brutal in its urgency, even during the acoustic set, let alone when they get to The Other One or Viola Lee Blues.<br /><br />So make sure you buy both!
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|amazing for all middle grades.<br />however not a good role model when it comes to leadership. Praise for Jeff Kinney good writing
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very clear and easy to use<br />. Always at hand. I like the reports throughout day and night. Best I have seen.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|LOVE this CD - Let's face I have a huge crush on JOE - and I am NOT a teenager but a grandmother!  We all can dream.  Joe has really experienced life at it's best, worse, and everything in between.  He is a fantastic musician, and has become a real grown up who has friends, family, and values.  Hearing his voice, those &#34;licks&#34; he does so flawlessly, and see that grin = thanks Joe!
B007EDYN36|4.0|We will probably never know what the absolute truth is, and there are very few that know it.  I agree with a previous reviewer that stated that memory is relative and subjective.  I also agree that if Peter Criss isn't stating the facts exactly as they occurred, it is not for a lack of trying.  With that having been said, I've read books from the other three members, and this APPEARS to be closer to the truth than any of the others.  Whenever you read a tell-all of this sort, you can usually tell which parts are basically propaganda.  You can also tell those subjects that are well-schooled in slipping punches.  Peter Criss doesn't appear to slip any punches in this tell-all, as he castigates himself as much as he does all of the others involved. Some would say that that's not good business, or not good for the brand, but Criss doesn't have appear to feel the need to continue to engage in propaganda.  Criss owns up to those things he did in the 70's, and he apologizes to the fans for being unappreciative, but he blames others for putting him in a position for rebellion.  He also expresses some duality when it comes to the money and Kiss, but by the end of the book, the reader can't help but take Criss's side in all that he details.  I did not approach this book from an objective position, as I was a huge Kiss fan, and I knew all the characters, and I wanted to know all the stories, but I can't help but think that this book will captivate a reader that knows nothing about the band.  It is not only captivating, but well-written in a relaxed, easy flow that I think all readers will enjoy.  And if Criss's version of these stories are not the truth, as Criss sees it, he should teach classes on how to coerce people into seeing things from their point of view.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I have watched the HBO special so many times, over and over.  Having this is so great, I have it on every week.  The Eagles are so great and so happy they got back together after such a long wait.  How could they have ever wondered it the public would welcome them back.  Their music is timeless.  Enjoyed getting insight on what many of my favorite plays expressed for them, for the comment on the world at that time.  Never gets old.  I love it!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app!  I use it when doing puzzles or reading on the kindle.  It has a very intuitive interface that allows you to layer sounds. Plus, if a sound combo does not work, you can easily remove components.

B0029XFNA8|5.0|A timely classic that you should have with your Christmas DVD's.  The original movie much better than all the other remakes
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have read this entire series and found it very hard to put down.  It catches your interest from the 1st chapter and definitely keeps you wanting to find out what happens next.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|This is my favorite disney movie, however i did order a used copy and the disk would skip half way through, but it was cheap so i didn't bother returning it.
B0039NJTLQ|4.0|Great movie highlighting  PTSD that our troops and family are currently dealing with. Great movie for psych students researching PTSD.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|It sucks that it was the final season, but they had a long run and a lot has happened through the years there isn't much left for them to do, no complaints with the actual disks themselves, shipping was quick and all of the disks worked perfectly
B001CC7PPI|5.0|I got this for my niece, she had seen previews of it on TCM over the years and she is a fashion major at an art school. She was totally thrilled with this movie, she loves the clothes worn by Grace Kelly.<br /><br />The movie was still sealed and arrived in great condition in plenty of time for her birthday!!
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Locks up phone and runs in the back ground sucking battery, Do not get this, Also see others had same issues. BAD APP.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good app.  Runs great.  Free version has advertisement between each game. Some look very official.  But most are easy to skip if you want.
B00F35BV64|1.0|When you watch science fiction, you take for granted that you will have to suspend your disbelief to a good degree, but sometimes it's more than you can take. We're really supposed to believe that there was no better option than to dangle Spock from a cable into an active volcano? And then, wouldn't you know it, HE FALLS IN! Luckily he manages to land in a safe spot. Every active volcano about to blow its top must have at least one, I think it's an EPA requirement. Who could have seen that coming...just about anyone who's ever seen a movie before. Meanwhile, it's really important that the natives not see us, so we'll hide the Enterprise in the ocean! OK, maybe something happened to all the shuttle crafts and they aren't space worthy right now, or more likely, it was just another cheap ploy to incorporate some cool special effects, like a starship rising out of the sea, glistening with CGI water! Give me a break. And it just goes on like that.<br /><br />And then, there's Khan. Does he look like a Khan? Does he sound like a Khan? And his acting, it reminded me of that big Easter dinner at Grandma's house: so much ham!<br /><br />Sure, a person can overlook all the flaws and enjoy the action and special effects, and many of us who have written negative reviews probably wouldn't have bothered if it weren't for what is being done to a once great franchise. Instead of trying to reinvent Star Trek, why not make a new sci-fi action movie? There's obviously a market for it, and many of us would be willing to pay good money to see such a thing, if only it were done WELL.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the most enjoyable Sci-fi I've read in quite awhile.  So glad the story continues with \\"Shift\\" and \\"Dust\\".  Thank you Hugh; you're my new favorite writer.
B002JC9RMY|1.0|I repeat: white-washed, rewritten garbage loosely based on Dragonball. This is horrible. It's not even \\"so bad it's good.\\" It's just plain horrible.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go watch the original Dragonball series.<br /><br />I hope there's a horrible place in the afterlife for whoever decided this should be white-washed.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  IT HAD IT ALL!!  HORROR, SCI-FI, MYSTERY, PARANORMAL SUSPENSE AND SO MUCH MORE.  THE MAIN CHARACTER WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT HE WAS LOSING HIS MIND.  THIS STORY IS SO ENGROSSING YOU START TO FEAR FOR YOUR OWN SANITY!  THERE WERE SO MANY INTERESTING TWISTS AND TURNS THAT YOU COULDN'T STOP READING.  YOU HAD TO KEEP GOING TO SEE WHAT NEW HORROR OR SURPRISE THE LEAD GUY WAS GOING TO CONFRONT.  HE WENT THROUGH SO MANY TERRIBLE SITUATIONS JUST TO END UP RIGHT WHERE HE STARTED.  THIS BOOK REMINDED ME OF AN OLD SERIES \\"TWIN PEAKS\\" THAT WAS ON YEARS AGO.  IT WAS  REALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS USUALLY MADE.  THIS BOOK WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THAT SERIES.  IT MADE YOU WONDER IF THIS SITUATION COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.  YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING ON THE Q.T.!  I HOPE NOT THOUGH.  TO LIVE A SURREAL LIFE WITH NO REAL FUTURE!!  YOU KEPT HOPING THAT THIS GUY WAS JUST HAVING A LONG, FRIGHTENING NIGHTMARE AND WOULD WAKE UP IN A COLD SWEAT BUT WITH EVERYTHING BEING AS IT WAS AND SHOULD BE.  THE AUTHOR HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE YOU FEEL COMPLETELY INVOLVED WITH THE STORY.  HE HAS A GREAT ABILITY FOR DESCRIPTION EVEN TO THE POINT THAT WHEN PEOPLE WERE RUNNING FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN FEAR, YOU STARTED TO FEEL OUT OF BREATH LIKE THEM AS IF YOU HAD BEEN RUNNING WITH THEM.  I FOUND MYSELF ABSORBED BY THIS STORY AND IT'S CHARACTERS.  I COULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK MORE HIGHLY.  NOW I'M OFF TO READ BOOK TWO OF THIS TRILOGY.  IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG WAIT FOR BOOK THREE NEXT YEAR!!!  ENJOY!!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Messed with my mind well after done watching it.  Beware!  But in a good way.  Plan to watch the next season when I can handle it!
B002N1AEN2|4.0|I bought Coexist and loved it so much I had to buy the first album. Wasn't as good as Coexist but very good
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|i am torn between a 3 or 4 star rating on this video, i think once i watch it again i will be able to settle on a 4 star rating.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Very good band and songs. You can find something in each song that can strike a cord in you. Great tracks I would recommend: House of Gold, Holding On To You, Migraine, Semi-Automatic, and The Run and Go. Enjoy!
0316228532|5.0|Couldn't help to love anything written by J. K. Rowling and looking forward to her new series of books coming out about the happenings before Hogwarts; bring it on and let me add more of her books to my collection.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|This is the first Arctic Monkeys CD I have ever bought. I have their older stuff but I never liked every song on them but on this CD I loved all of the tracks.
B00EOFIYZA|1.0|I have to agree with a few of the other posters, having already bought Halcyon so I have 18 out of these 28 songs. So if I buy the ones I can individually it'd cost me $15, almost the full cost of the album, and I still miss out on 3 of the album only songs. Can they just release a \\"Halcyon Days Addition album\\" which has the 10 new ones that Halycon owners would already have? I really like her music, but I'm skipping on this album on principal alone.<br /><br />Like another poster said it... a lousy way to treat fans.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|This classic is every bit as good as the latest Multi million dollar blockbuster. If only we had Hitchcock's talent in today's movies.
B002V091K2|4.0|I liked the story and the twist at the end.  Good writing and an easy read. Will read more of Jodi's books.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|I enjoy the detail and creativity of the characters.  The story kept me interested until the end.  I loved it.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It will not charge my kindle fire.  Itis useless I cant use my I wonder if it is the plug where you connect
B0036UMM84|4.0|I enjoyed this movie after waiting to see it again for thirty years.  I was so happy to see that Amazon had it, because Netflix and others did not.  Listening to the music reminded me of days gone by.  It may seem a little cheesy now, but pretend like you are back in the 70's and enjoy!
B00BE97ONM|5.0|What a great surprise to find a new author to read! Jams N. Roses has written a great dark and twisted psycho thriller. The story begins with a bang, using short chapters to introduce us into the world of these intriguing characters, some of them even staying alive long enough to get to them well, maybe even too well. This was a great read and I'll be checking out the other titles from Roses.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The characters were interesting, maybe too many.  Because of all the details he covered on each person, I lost the story.  Had to go back and remind myself who was who.  I kept waiting for it all to come together. In kite runner and a thousand splendid suns the story lines were easier to follow and I  felt satisfied and completed at the conclusion of the books.<br /><br />If you liked his other books, I feel you might be disappointed in this one.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Stone makes a pretty solid case for the fact that it was a conspiracy; each little individual doubt taken by itself doesn't do the trick, but when ALL are taken together???  JAJAJAJAJAJA
B00EYAMEX8|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect but this really blew me away : Very outstanding debut for a new artist. This girl is extremely talented. It really has a mature sound to it. Its a good mix of pop rnb and dubstep. She will go very far in this music industry. I know that there is this stigma of \\" oh no here we go with another Disney actor who wants to be a singer/dancer \\" but Zendaya is the exception; She is really talented; I didnt expected this CD to be this good. Listening to this CD,you can tell that Janet Jackson, MJ, Aliyah and Beyonce are her influences. I am really excited to see her continue to be successful and strive to the top; My favorites songs are 1)Bottle you up (I looove this song ) so emotional and her voice is amazing in this; 2) Scared reminds me of a MJ song; I love how it is haunting at the beginning then go to fast and slow and slow to fast; then all the songs in no particular order; Every song on this album can be a SINGLE that's how good this CD is. I absolutely love it :). Give this CD a chance and you wont be disappointed :).
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This is a movie that needs no review; all who see it and have a human heart and are not beasts inside, can not but help and admire it.  It is also, one of the most difficult films to see.  It brings pain and suffering with it.  But it is necessary.  The human race MUST declare:  &#34;NEVER AGAIN&#34;; &#34;NUNCA OTRA VEZ&#34;~!!!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Great game until I tried to buy some gems, paid for them and never got them. And now game freezes when playing and closes.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It's safe, easy and quick .i recomend to download from a safe place that shows confident without viruses. Now i can see my favorites videos thanks amazon.
B007QEHQY6|5.0|I wanted  CD recordings of the&#34; Planets&#34; and the&#34; Hymn to Jesus.&#34;  The rest was just a gift I  have yet to listen to in it's entirety.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|Game play is simple enough to figure out. Entertaining for a while, but I get bored fairly quickly with it. It is too complicated for my 4 year old, at least so far. I do find it annoying that I have to mute the sound every time I open the game because it doesn't remember my settings.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Normally I'm not much of a very Violent movie watcher. After seeing this on the TV guide several times I tuned in. The show intrigued me and I kept watching. It's humor made me laugh and the quirkiness kept me intrigued.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent show! Characters are interesting and well developed. Plot is gripping and leaves you wanting more at the end if every episode. I highly recommend this show!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is very fun to play when you are bored. This game is also very good for your brain.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Every year I order a Holiday Barbie for each of my girl grandchildren every since they have been born. I keep them, in box, to present them on their 18th birthdays. Packaging is always great and easy to box for the wait over time.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|She is awesome, very different from any other artist. I like the combo of violin and electronica music. I would definitely recommend it.
B005DJREJS|1.0|The only reason that I gave it one star was that after I ought it I couldn't watch it because of my Internet or something about a proxy.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Awesome to see the original series without commercials or missing scenes! Colors are beautiful and everything is so clear. Well done.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|IT WAS GOOD NOT GREAT. I SEE WHY HE WAS PICKED FOR MAGIC MIKE. I STILL LOVE CHANNING. LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS NEW MOVIES THAT ARE JUST COMING OUT. CAN NOT WAIT TILL THEY ARE ON DVD'S.
1452101248|5.0|And when you make the recipes, they look like the pictures without even trying.  I've made the green bean salad and it was wonderful.  Looking forward to making a lot of the squash recipes now that there is a slight chill in the air.  The cover is really well constructed, almost with a padded feel to it.  The recipes are all really approachable, with no &#34;you really need these super secret spy chef skills&#34; hidden in there.  The pages are thick and glossy.  It is one of the more beautiful book s i own.  Looking forward to picking up jeruselum and ottolenghi.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is addicting but yet very frustrating. I want to play but yet I want to crush this Minions head. LOL

B008220BP2|5.0|Warm Bodies is a neat little horror movie now playing over the Internet.  \\"Cute\\", \\"sweet\\" and \\"funny\\" are not words I normally associate with zombie movies. \\"Gross\\", \\"disgusting\\" and \\"gore\\" are the ones I use. But this movie, directed by novice filmmaker Jonathan Levine, surprised me. I don't know if it's a new trend in zombie entertainment, but a nice zombie-human love story is a positive one.<br /><br />\\"R\\" is a living dead flesh-eating zombie who spends his days stumbling around an abandoned airport with the rest of the reanimated corpses. But he realizes his situation is hopeless. Most of the introduction to Warm Bodies consists of his internal monologues. For instance:<br /><br />\\"What am I doing with my life? I'm so pale. I should get out more. I should eat better. My posture is terrible. I should stand up straighter. People would respect me more if I stood up straighter. What's wrong with me? I just want to connect. Why can't I connect with people? Oh, right, it's because I'm dead.\\"<br /><br />Prior to the opening of the film, a zombie apocalypse had taken place. Most of the human survivors have gathered in a walled-off fortress where General Grigio (Malkovitch) manages to keep the remaining humans alive. The zombies exist in two forms: 1) the \\"corpses\\", who stumble around all day, looking for human food and 2) The \\"bonies\\", skeletor things who will \\"eat anything with a pulse\\". The major difference between the corpses and the bonies are how they view their existence: corpses will eat the living, but feel conflicted about it.<br /><br />A team of young adults are sent out beyond the wall to scourge for much-needed medical supplies. While the corpses attack, \\"R\\" finds himself smitten with one of the women (Teresa Palmer). Although he's munched on her boyfriend's brains, he pulls her out of the mob and takes her to safety in his private crash pad. At first she's terrified of him, but \\"R\\" manages to win her trust. He shows her how to act like a zombie to avoid being eaten. Eventually she makes it back to the human side of the wall.<br /><br />But she's started something within \\"R\\". As he begins to develop human feelings, he becomes less of a zombie. Soon, the other corpses are learning to be human again. The bonies don't like this one bit and toss them out of the abandoned airport. Knowing the bonies are massing toward the human city, the corpses link-up with \\"R\\" and head toward the last refuge of humanity. Will the corpses be able to stop the Bad Living Dead? Will the humans not shoot the corpses and accept their help? Will \\"R\\" be able to express his love for the human woman?<br /><br />It may all sound silly, but the movie works. There are some hilarious moments. Such as a scene where \\"R\\" tries to imagine how the airport looked before the zombie apocalypse. Instantly, we see how it was in the old days, with bored travelers shuffling around the terminal staring at their smart phones with glassy eyes.<br /><br />So check it out if you get a chance. It's not even that violent.<br />[...]it back to the human side of the wall.    But she's started something within \\"R\\". As he begins to develop human feelings, he becomes less of a zombie.

B000I0XLYO|4.0|Zoolander isn't exactly a subtle in its humor and it won't challenge you intellectually, but it has more than its share of genuinely funny moments.
0887431461|5.0|Great practice and learning material for children entering grade K. All my children used these types of workbooks at home during the summer, going to doctor's office, ect before entering the next grade, or as a rewiew from the previous year and it helps. It keeps them thinking and they love it.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Great game. No issues that I have come across.... it better on an iPad or kindle.. to small on my phone... it is set up differently on phone as well... but overall great game
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I love the idea that they really do care for each other inspite of her sickness, and how the relationship first begin.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loved this Robert Langdon story! Learned a lot and opened my mind to many other things! Really enjoyed the history lessons too!
B00004XQ83|4.0|I bought this cd for a friend who LOVES the movie, and he immediately had to put it in his car so he'd have it when he traveled. The music makes you remember scenes from the movie, and you just have to smile.
0385751532|5.0|my son received his book. It is easy for him to read, he shared with others after he was done with it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie was far better than the trailer led me to believe. It was exciting with plenty of twists and turns and surprises.<br /><br />I loved the soda cans and the walk of survival when Brad walked down the hall with the box.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|while it is not classic trek, this is better.<br />the cast is comfortable in their roles and it shows.<br />the last twenty minutes are some of the best action that have been seen in a trek movie.<br />some have complained about the soundtrack, I think it fits.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Modern Combat 4 defiantly stands out. But with some awkward glitches its hard to play.<br />Graphics: the graphics for this game is amazing. But the story is hard to follow. It tries to hard to be like Call of Duty. That is something they shouldn't have done. Even playing as Page its still the same game.<br />Multiplayer: the multiplayer is okay. The only problem is that there's barely anyone online and the fact that you need a gameloft account just to play is annoying.<br />Gameplay: the control's are similar to Nova 3. Though you can move around the buttons on the screen which is good. It took me 5 minutes to do it. There are some glitches like shooting an enemy killing him but him still standing.<br />Verdict:<br />+gameplay<br />+like Call of Duty<br />-glitches<br />-boring story<br />Rating: 7.5
0738212415|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  I am returning to drawing after many years and have purchased a number of drawing books.  My other books were too much too soon with me being a rusty as I am.<br /><br />With this book I am having small success.  It is a great review and fun. This is a beginner book and will not take long to work through. But you can add as much as you want to it.  I was so proud of my spheres and tennis balls that I looked up how to draw crystal, metal and concrete spheres.  The bottom line is that because of the success I had with the simple sphere lesson I took it much further on my own.  I am easily adding on to each chapter.<br /><br />The author does say that this is book is not intended to make a finished graphite artist but someone competent in basic drawing. I really feel it is bringing back my foundation.

B00EV4EUT8|4.0|I love Oprah as much as reason allows, and that, favorable pre-movie buzz, and Oscar talk propelled me to see this movie. In fact I looked forward to it with some anticipation.<br /><br />The beginning stated that the movie was inspired by a true story.  If there was one thing I would change about the movie it would be that statement, as some of the more significant story elements used in this movie are in fact not true.  That is not to diminish the story in any way as entertainment, but to depict something as a true story, and then foist a not true narrative on the spectator does not bode well for the movies Oscar aspirations, though it has not hurt it at the box office.<br /><br />With the well deserved success of the superior movie  'The Help,' from last year, the writers of this movie were obviously hoping to get similar acclaim for this movie.<br /><br />The movie opens in a deep south plantation cotton field in 1926, and a young black boy watches as the plantation owners son grabs the boys mother (played by Mariah Carey) and pulls her into the barn, where we can deduce what happens.  When the owner emerges what happens next is fiction.  The landowners mother or aunt, played by Vanessa Redgrave perhaps moved by pity, or guilt, then trains the boy to be a house slave, I mean servant.  When the boy grows up, he leaves the plantation, and filled with determination to make a better life for himself than his parents somehow becomes the White house butler.<br /><br />Except in reality the inciting event did not happen.<br /><br />What I did like about the movie is that it was well made, and has a stellar cast.  Several performances are worth talking about, particularly Forest Whitaker as The Butler, who may win an Oscar nomination, and I particularly liked James Marsden's take on John F Kennedy.  John Cusack gave an interesting though unlikely performance as Nixon.  Lenny Kravitz is also a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />In fact, as entertainment, it is quite good.  A few tv commentators have talked up Oprah's performance. Oprah has her moments in this movie, though I thought she was better in both Beloved, and The color Purple. Here she plays the Butler's alcoholic wife, who may not or may not be having an affair with the character played by Terence Brady.  A scene where she danced along to the telly was subtle and amusing, and a scene where she  puts on lipstick in front of the mirror while arguing with her husband and about to go to bed I found to be messed up but arresting.  Who puts on lipstick to go to bed?  What about the laundry bills?<br /><br />As a scene where a character criticized Sidney Poitier unfolded I found myself wondering what would Oprah do.  This was a great scene.<br /><br />One of the more surprising elements of the story, apparently true, was that despite all the Civil Rights laws passed in the 1960s, black Butlers still had less pay and opportunity for advancement than their white counterparts, although we do not see any white butlers in the movie. It's really curious that the Kennedys would not do anything about it, or Nixon though in the movie he makes a campaign promise to the butlers to that effect.  It's not until Reagan becomes President that that is resolved, although Reagan's son takes issue with how his father is depicted in the movie on other matters.<br /><br />So the movie has attracted some controversy, yet has done very well at box office.  As I write it has grossed over $102 million in 5 weeks of release having spent three weekends at number one.  So it's success is assured.  The movie is based on an interview given by Eugene Allen in 2008 to the Washington Post.  He had a son who fought in the Vietnam War and survived.<br /><br />I think most people will enjoy the movie.  As true stories go, it's true that it's a story.  As entertainment goes, it's true that it's entertaining.<br /><br />I think most people will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.few tv commentators have talked up Oprah's performance.

B00B1COIRW|5.0|Because the movie I wanted to see was not due to start for another hour, I wandered to another cinema, and noticed this movie starring Berenice Bejo, the actress from The Artist which won five Oscars.  I decided to watch it.<br /><br />Populaire may best be described as a stylish French movie which blends the excellence of My Fair Lady, with elements of Rocky.<br /><br />A girl from a provincial town has a dream of being a secretary, not the loftiest of dreams perhaps, but she heads to the the city for a job interview where many girls have the same dream.  The girl can best described as a charming composite of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />When the employer rejects her for the job, and goes to call the next girl, she sits down at the typewriter, and hunts and pecks at incredible speed.  Impressed, the handsome employer hires her.  A week later, still impressed by her speed but not impressed by her incompetence as a secretary he proposes to fire her unless...<br /><br />The employer still has a thing for an old flame who provides a mature casual sophisticated sexy contrast to our innocent girl and seems more obsessed with our girl winning typing competitions than anything else, like Rocky's coach in Rocky.  You may wonder if that can change, and our girl gets an unlikely ally in her pursuit of love.<br /><br />If you're like me you root for the girl, both in typing and in love, but as we know from movies if not from real life the course of true love does not always run smooth.  The music helps to convey the atmosphere both of love and the 50s beautifully, and the further the movie progressed the more I was drawn into the love story.<br /><br />Some of the scenes particularly the competition scenes I loved particularly how the women are so competitive, and I loved the facial expressions and the psyche outs.  Very subtle touches. This is a very clever movie which I absolutely loved. Sometimes I have difficulty persuading people that a movie is good.  This time though at least three people asked about the movie and said they were going to see it.<br /><br />It's very charming, and you are unlikely to see anything else quite like it.  It is subtitled but that did not diminish my enjoyment in any way.  I think most people will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.time though at least three people asked about the movie and said they were going to see it.<br /><br />It's very charming, and you are unlikely to see anything else quite like it.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Advertising is a bit heavy and not always clear how to skip.  Also not crazy about the app asking personal questions, presumably to target marketing.  Guess they have to keep the lights on somehow and at least the purposes seem transparent.

B002ZG999U|1.0|Its loud, its bloody and its silly.  If you are into these three movie themes then this movie is for you.  I watched an hour of the movie then I shut it off.  My mind could not take the noise. Its not even a guy's movie.  Its more like a killer's movie. This movie should be listed as a horror movie not an Action movie

0062020897|5.0|Anything he writes is just great.  This is no exception.  There is a movie out too which I want to see.  It's a good tale- intrigue, murder, suspense.  It has a bit of everything including Nazi's and British agents, not to mention a brave heroine.  Read it, you'll like it.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I been waiting for this to come out for the past month. I has a very cool gameplay, if your.an angry bird fan I believe you should get it! And it's free!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow! Couldn't put this one down. Lovely blend of characters and plot...absolutely loved the epilogue...this is a must read! Great job Liane Moriarty!
0143123173|4.0|I wasn't sure when I picked it up whether it would keep me interested and move at the pace I like to go. I usually read books like this in one day, so I want them to move quickly and keep me interested. At first, the book covers made me believe that it was a desolate scene, cold, only a few characters, maybe not what I look for. Boy, that was a wrong impression. Great characters, well plotted, snappy dialogue, and it interested me enough to continue with the series. All-in-all, for those of us who like these kinds of series and characters...this is a great fit!  Fun to read.
B004EPZ070|3.0|Love the actors and acting in this story of a 'good-girl' who finally getting what she deserves; however, the story line falls a little flat. Worth watching, but don't expect a timeless love story.
0345541588|5.0|I am not sure whether it was religious overtones, or just plain viral discontent among Reacher fans that gave this book low reviews. I loved the book! It was genuine Reacher, and I am in the midst of reading them all in correct order. I'm a few past this book already, and I can't understand what would cause the number of one star reviews. I am glad that I ignored them! You should too! if you are a die-hard Reacher fan, go with the book!
B004MYFV0O|5.0|It's a lot of fun. Drawings look real almost right out of the bat!! Easy instructions and don't need expensive equipment
0452282152|4.0|I'm a bit behind with my reading of some books and finally got to this title.  I'm enjoying it, but knowing what I know about the time period (1600s), life was NOT easy and clean as it's depicted here and that element of the book bothers me for some reason.  Food preparation was not as straightforward as it's made out to be, obtaining food wasn't as simple as going to the market (like we go to the grocery store), keeping clean and neat wasn't easy, and running a household like this one wasn't all just dealing with a few political games with the mistresses of the home.<br /><br />That being said, I am still enjoying the social history aspects of the book, imagining daily life as a maid and her family.  It's interesting to imagine the life of a famous painter who works at home with his family around -- a twist to today's work-at-home family members facing similar issues of needing quiet, having business visitors, etc.<br /><br />The writing is simple, but that's the beauty of it.  It moves quickly and tells a story that builds.  It's a quick and great read and if you have any interest in Vermeer, painting, Holland, social life of the 1600s, etc. you'll enjoy this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple yet effective. Glad that I ran a cross this app, will continue to use this in a pinch. Thanks
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Love this game!<br /><br />Very addicting. I play against my grand sons all the time :)<br /><br />Takes some hand coordination in my opinion.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|Picked this up for my grandson for summer reading.  He's not an enthusiastic reader at 16, but he enjoyed this book.  Didn't have to remind him, he just kept going back for more.
1574214276|5.0|I am just beginning to get into Zentangling and found this book to be the most helpful of the four I own.  One of the highlights of the book is Chapter Four's &#34;Tangle Directory&#34;, a visual summary of all the tangles used throughout the book ... all in one place.  Photocopied and cut to fit into a small photo album, they provide a take-along reference of ideas when &#34;on the road.&#34;
B0083Z614S|5.0|I greatly enjoy this book  and I would read it again in a heart beat! The only thing that I  didn't like about this book is all the talk about magic.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great narrative of people and events surrounding the changing times in Europe and around the world at the turn of the century .  Rushing headlong into war and revolution the characters are muddied along the torrent of history.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Such great writing, casting, characters, storyline etc etc All of it. So good to watch good tv! Alicia kicks butt!
B00881VLCE|3.0|puzzles are enjoyable.....when they are not \\"crashing\\" this happens too often. scenery of pics ARE beaitiful.please correct this. then this will be rated \\"5 star\\" in my opinion. thank you.
0743497465|5.0|Hey its a Dan Brown book ---need I say more!!!!  As usual it is superbly crafted and  tesnsion builds till the last page.
1452126607|2.0|Basically, it's 12 months of the cover photo (a grumpy cat pic photoshopped into a stock background) with a different meme text for each month. The same 4 pics of grumpy are repeated over and over. It's cute and all (the Dec one with a santa hat photoshopped on that says, &#34;I got you a present, check the litter box&#34; is the best one), but definitely NOT worth $13.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I cannot wait for season 4 but worry that the show will run its course so buying the DVDs to keep for my own little library of British Classics.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its fun to play. My grandkids love it.the minions are cute. I would play it every day if I had the time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beyond the intrigue of the story the setting in London during the WWII bombing brought home the tragedies of war.  I found the book difficult to leave.  Enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! me and my brother always go head to head to see who loses first or who collects the most bananas this game make me happy!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first review ever because until now I haven't had a book that enthralled me more. I couldn't put it down. Read it in one sitting. Then devoured the second on in the saga. I am now onto third in as many days. This book took what I love about the genre and made it great.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|It was great came really fast and I just can't get the songs out of my head something aboutusic like this makes me smile and the fact that I can remember the episode it was on made me tear up such a great soundtrack
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I got this for use with a Zoom H1, but this mic required the input level to be cranked up really high, introducing a lot of noise.  Although it might be fine for other applications, as a mic for the Zoom H1, it was pretty much unusable.<br /><br />Although it's not my review, this shows the issue I was having: [...]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the size is fantastic.  easy to use .  very useful.  everyone should try it !! you won't be sorry !!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|No comment. 5 stars! But this requires  a lot of words to let me hit submit. Still more words. One more.
006117758X|5.0|Definitely one of Bukowski's best. An interesting look at where the writer came from and the people he grew up around- through the eyes of the writer. If you are fan of Bukowski, this is a must read.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I originally rated this 1 star due to receiving a defective unit and having to ship it back to Amazon for a refund. I figured I'd never buy another Anker product again.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I received an email from a customer support manager offering to send me another unit free of charge, and apologizing for the inconvenience of the defective unit.<br /><br />The working usb 3.0 hub arrived today and I tested all ports and everything is working. Really surprised with Anker customer support, you don't see much of that level of commitment to customer satisfaction anymore.<br /><br />If you have any problems with a unit you received, I'd recommend contacting Anker support, they will make things right.
B00164GDA0|5.0|A perfect movie for boys who love to explore. One of my all time favorite movies growing up because I could relate to exploring the railways.
B00F0349LS|5.0|I'm not good at  stating why something sounds good or at giving detailed analysis of sounds and metaphoric descriptors... But i do have an ear for good music and Placebo has been my fave band since 1998.  And this 7th and newest album doesn't disappoint! I have been playing it repeatedly in my car and on my phone with headphones since the early morning of release day. This is another killer album by an awesome band that doesn't get enough attention here in the states.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was my Book Club selection, and all loved it.  It was sensitive, thought-provoking, characters finely drawn - and even had its moments of humor.  All in all - an excellent read.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|I have always liked this movie. I like to watch it every once in a while! Just very visual and visceral.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love this book it is a great  kindle book! I think this book is for more  middle school age kids but still Read it because it is invigorating and a book for the whole family! The one thing you will be wanting is to read is the next Book! And if you are big Percy fan you will love this ESPECIALLY if you love Rome!
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Not fond of the language and violence, but gave it a shot. Doesn't mean that other people won't like it. It just wasn't my cup of tea.
B0015AARJI|5.0|great option this control are very nice are wireless what more could you ask for?, if you want to play in the company of friends or family this is your best option
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Characters are so interesting and mysterious., while plot is gut-wrenching  Great writing and acting - can't wait for next season!
B00C5R8364|5.0|To see the first page is to enter into that world of the wordsmith from which there's no escape but the dreaded last one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books just make you want to keep reading. I'm almost finished with the third book now and will miss them when I'm done.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The ads are so big they restrict the map (which is the reason I wanted the app in the first place)
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Amazon user which means I cannot get free peanuts.  Peanuts are the currency of the game's.  But since I cannot get the peanuts for free I would have to purchase them wit real money.  SO NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!  App deleted
B0071XO8RA|3.0|It is agonizingly slow in unfolding,bogged down in detail, and rather boring.....but read for yourself?,,,,I will not bother with sequels?
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I live in rural ND in a small town without a big theatre or even a video store to rent DVD's. I have wanted to see this since it came out.  I just finally decided I would buy it. Can't beat the price for it here on Amazon!
B0027MJU00|5.0|A very good read. Interesting but not necessarily likable characters. I highly recommend although Sharp Objects us my favorite by Flynn.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book<br />There were so many great twists and turns.<br />Kept you guessing til the end<br />Highly recommend this novel
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing experiments.  The first one resulted in a signed lease on a rental that sat empty for over 2 months.  Very fun, doing it with a girlfriend & enjoying it very much.  Great price too!
B0007LGCB8|4.0|Good Quality Sandal!  I had never worn a pair of Keen Sandals before and usually had a pair of Rocky or Columbia.  They fit just as they needed in my size and are very comfortable.  Quality seems high.
B0031RG846|5.0|Wife bought these to put on our kids birthday cake so it would look pretty and it gave her an excuse to buy the kid more toys. It is what it is and it s just exactly that.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I enjoyed the unique gameplay, overall concept, and execution of this game. Don't let the simple premise fool you, this game becomes challenging pretty quick.
B003WMA7BU|5.0|I know folks say the book is always better, but I thought this was so different than the movie that comparing to two seemed silly. Definitely enjoyed the writing and the pace.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I really enjoyed this game on my 10' Android tablet. Intuitive controls and excellent graphics round out a stellar experience. This is one &#34;must have&#34; if you are looking for a racing game on Android.
B009NY43NY|2.0|After reading allof the novels I was really disapointed with this one. Where was the big finish? To me it seemed as though she was bored with it. Too bad.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|the sound is great! I swim laps and they make me swim longer and faster. I do wish you could adjust the volume thought, but if you move it around your cheek you can adjust the volume.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This was a fantastic series. I would recommend it to anyone. It was as if you were transported back in time. I put on my bucket list to visit England, Wales, Scotland & Ireland. The costumes were gorgeous.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Excellent, great playing, fun songs...in that Buck Owens style. Good listening, nice selection of songs. i would recommend this cd.
B000FC13E0|5.0|If you like to be scared silly, then this book is one of two that will accomplish that.  The other is Micro....another Crichton book.  Your will love them.
0345529057|5.0|Love the show and could not wait until next season, so will read these until next season starts. They are awesome.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|This is, along with PREY, Michael Crichton's best and scariest.  You will not be able to put the book down.  I miss him already.  What a genius!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|We were somewhat disappointed in this movie, a bit slow and not much of a plot. Rather basic movie not a lot to it.
B002GSXKN8|4.0|Good deal for the price,all four Batman's. Will play in English, French and<br />Spanish. With subtitles if you like.Two movies per disc. Great in surround.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I LOVE THE FEVER  SERIES I LOVE MAC AND BARRON AND THE MIX OF ADVENTURE and  SUSPENSE I AM NOW READING THR SERIES FOR THE 3RD TIME
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Possibly one of the most hyped zombie films since the 1968 \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" is \\"28 Days Later\\" and having seen both of those iconic movies along with countless others I can confidently say that \\"World War Z\\" easily outranks `em as far as pure entertainment and not to mention it's truly epic.<br /><br />Hey, before ya press the \\"No\\" button under \\"was this review helpful?\\" listen to my case.<br /><br />What WWZ has:  Brad Pitt (this is coming from a non-fan btw) who is not only ridiculously handsome as always but a good enough actor to make us believe he's a post-apocalyptic special envoy for the U.N. and a pretty tough survivor type to boot.  Action... and I'm not talking about stupid, Hollywood over-the-top fluff but riveting events which we can get caught up in without eclipsing the underlying story or defying credibility (not too much anyway).  Zombies par excellence! This is how the undead should look and I'm totally ok with them occasionally moving at leopard speed or building zombie pyramids cuz it all fits in with them no longer being human.  And finally, a great script aided by a filming style which enhances the overall level of dramatic intensity and allows the viewer to take this story seriously.<br /><br />When I think of all the cheesy and terrible zombie films made over the last 30 years and yet try to view WWZ as its own production rather than through the lens of past genre benchmarks then I must give it a 5 star for the reasons I've already mentioned as well as originality.  :o)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Read this for my book club.  Everyone liked it, with reservations.  Jumping back and forth into time, places and characters got  confusing for some.  Beautifully descriptive, fascinating story lines.  Just too many.  Well worth reading, though.  The story stays with you.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|As driving, as dissonant and yet coherent, as varied in pace in tone and as freakin awesome as any QOTS album so far, but different.  Different enough to feel like you've discovered something new with old friends, something lyrical, dark, and smooth.  At times ...Like Clockwork feels like it almost borrows (never steals) from some Floyd and other greats and does them justice.  Imitation is the sincerest form of saying 'I think I can do that one better'.  There is even a song that is like Maroon 5 tripping out.  I've been chomping at the bit for a new album from Homme and crew and am not disappointed.  I didn't just buy 10 new songs off the floor of an old album, I got a new work of art.  Enjoy,<br /><br />Update:  I CAN NOT stop listening to this album.  It is too highly varied to get bored of and so incredibly catchy and deep at the same time.  Best album of the year.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Did not like the way this author put events, people, etc. together to make his own scenario. Didnt like the writing style, didnt finish the book.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is the best 3-d game ever. But you could ad so you can move your self<br />And so their is less Gore
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Loved this show. Not my first time seeing it but was in the mood to watch Mal and Co again
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|If you go looking for good plot and character development maybe not that good. Looking for a good time and entertainment this a good option, for a Red Box night or cable. In my opinion it was a fun movie an I enjoy movies with a twist at the end.
B009CG8EOM|5.0|This movie has excellent effects. Brilliant acting by Charlize Theron! Love &#34;Breath of Life&#34; by Florence and the Machine! A new favorite for sure...
0143123173|5.0|The Walt Longmire series is an excellent read for those who enjoy mystery mixed with the beautiful descriptions of the countryside around Buffalo (Durant) WY.  I especially like the fact that you have several suspects but don't know the truth until the spellbinding end.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Great album!  I really like Gaga she is a true artist and brings visual, sound and fashion back to music!  Can't wait for the new CD in October!!
B008133MDK|4.0|I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan.  I love this series take on the relationship between Watson and Holmes. Benedict makes a great Holmes.
B0039N74CW|4.0|Enjoy the widescreen.  The DVD arrived in a very timely manner.  I would recommend to others in regards to the arrival of the DVD and the widescreen.
B00F91H666|3.0|No waiting for the action on this one. Some good tension scenes, no academy awards for acting but that wasn't the point anyway.Zombie apocalypse, lots of stuff blowing up, cast of CGI thousands and Brad Pitt beefcake. The zombies are pretty typical but weirdly flexible, going from twitching, limping wrecks to speedy predators in mere seconds. I'm not sure I understood why there wasn't more exploitation of their attraction to noise throughout the film, but there y'go. Not for small children or squeamish adults, but if you watch The Walking Dead it's a piece of cake.<br /><br />It was worth a rental but I doubt I'll be putting in my library.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Small steps lead to a new life. A very sheltered young woman finds ways to change the lives of others.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Nice to sit back and watch with no commercials at your pace. Great way the catch up with last season before this season starts.
B00F35BV64|4.0|well you have to remember that this is set in a different time line and the one of the enemies is of course one from original tv series and movie.  This is a pretty good science fiction movie, I rented it and watched it twice.  There is a constant emergency as always with one thing or another.  I am still having trouble with such a young captain kirk being in command. Good  supporting characters are in good supply.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'd been weight training for about 6-7 years before reading this book and would consider myself to be in pretty good nick but have still never fully reached my aesthetic goal (however vain that may sound). I bought this book on a bit of whim after seeing how many good reviews it had got and I wasn't let down.<br />Unlike other weight training/health books it doesn't just leave you with unanswered questions for the first half of the book, Michael addresses them and pretty soon afterwards he talks you through them. At the same time as highlighting the things that you could potentially be doing wrong he doesn't dwell on these areas either, which I would find particularly annoying because it can seem quite patronising and you just want to get on with knowing what to actually be doing.<br />Finally the actual content is solid, it's all backed up with references and I learnt a lot of interesting stuff about how to train and was reassured about other stuff such as not having to mix up my routines the whole time. He dabbles nicely in some nutritional advice, which I found the most useful as I think nutrition is the key thing I have to change in order to reach my goal.<br />On top of all that, he gives you a free one year challenge report to help you through the first year. He's all give this chap so the least I could do was write a review for him.<br />If you're looking to learn some more about weight training and nutrition in order to reach your goals in the shortest amount of time then look no further than this book.<br />I'm going to start my one year challenge next week and I can't wait.<br />Cheers in advance Michael
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Just requiring and I am completely disappointed. How can you leave the story so unfinished. I hope she writes another book is all I have to say.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not believe this is a free game!  The graphics are great, the mechanics are quick and easy to learn, and the game itself is addictive.  The minions are so cute, too!  What's not to love?
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Greatest movie ever!! One of the funniest comedies to come from the era, once you get passes the retardness, it's pure genius by Ben stiller, as per usual
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|She's some kind of weird but I love love love her music.  Ready for her next big hit to purchase.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just started playing this game and I can not put it down I love how many levels there are
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Great read. Useful insights into machinations and manipulations of devious leaders everywhere including our  allies and our own  trusted leaders
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is definitely a game that will challenge your mind but fun! I would recommend this app/game! I love games that challenge your mind and this definitely will challenge it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Think this game is a  awesome game it's very enteraining and and very fun I give this game 5 stars
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it great game play it everyday but could use a few more things to do. Also more horses to buy with money instead gems.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|This is a lucid and informative synthesis of a number of great books by real historians (e.g., Burns, Cole, Davis) who relied in the main on primary sources. One finds few, if any, primary sources here, which is disappointing unless one just wants \\"History Lite\\" or \\"Popular History.\\" Certainly, such books--any books that get us reading and excited about history--are great literary contributions. Considering the extraordinary, bone-shaking nature of the times, however, this reader disappointingly found very little fresh, very little in the way of interpretation. The book reads, rather, like a very fine dissertation by a doctoral or Masters candidate.<br /><br />For a fascinating account encompassing these times and showing what can be done with a fresh look at primary sources, please consider David Roll's outstanding \\"The Hopkins Touch,\\" appearing earlier this year.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This game is easy and fun 2 do.I never thought that there was a game for this.it's hard to put it down.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|How can one go wrong with minions? One failed supervillain, three orphaned girls, and a whole lot of minions filled this movie full of laughs and enjoyable scenes.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a must read! It shows a real picture of how young teenagers feel when they know they are going to die sooner than needed. Love this book!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is great for ages 8 and up. As the levels progress, it gets more difficult, but not unbearably so.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Son of a Serial Killer had me from the first chapter. this book has murder, madness and a sprinkle of love - everthing I would want from a psychological thriller! Perfect.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Loved watching the series; I started the first season on TV; but couldn't find time to watch, now I can't wait to watch the 3rd season. When will that we available. thanks
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Reading \\"Finding Her Feet\\" has put a smile on my face at times, but more than once I have shed tears whilst reading, especially at the end. Wow. The author must have been something like this to write about this subject with so much heart. A brilliant story that I highly recommend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow thats what I have to say. This was an incredible book to read, I couldn't put it down, I read all 3 with in one month. Awesome!
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Don't bother buying this item.. It didn't fit my kindle fire and probably will not fit yours if you buy one.. It's hard to even give this item a single star.  stay away from it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Works well, does what I want. I enjoy the sounds and love the layering ability. This helps me sleep when my mind is still racing at the end of the day.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|This book is such a classic and it is such a wonderful  remembrance to have Grandma and Grandpa read our favorite!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|We have loved this movie for years....rented it now to show our new daughter-in-law...how in the world did she grow up without seeing this!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Others have reviewed the Google Chromecast for it's capabilities and ease of use. I want to make a couple points on it's limitations.<br /><br />First, it only works for applications that are designed (or have been modified) for it. That currently (September 2013) means Netflix, YouTube and Google Play. I use Netflix and very occasionally YouTube, but I don't buy/rent individual DVDs from Google Play, so this thing is pretty limited. Maybe other app developers will upgrade their products. Wait and see.<br /><br />Second, it doesn't work with Chrome (!!) browsers except on certain devices. It definitely doesn't work with any smartphone browser and it doesn't work with Google Chrome on my \\"ancient\\" Galaxy Tab 7.<br /><br />In fact, the only real use I get out of it is to cast via Netflix (smartphone and browser). At $35, that is a worthwhile convenience, but if you are buying this to do more (especially to cast tabs from a browser), you may be disappointed. I know I was.<br /><br />Google says it is early -- that many more cast-enabled apps are in the pipeline. But I doubt they'll go back to add cast capabilities to (pre-28) Chrome browsers in earlier Android OS versions. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 cannot be upgraded as this time, so it looks like Netflix today, Netflix tomorrow and Netflix forever. (With apologies to George Wallace.)<br /><br />It also should have MiraCast capability.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I love this game so much I already know most of these items but I am having a lot of fun making a reef.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|R u people at kindle nuts. You can have cheats for a game you don't even carry. WORD TO THE WISE GET BETTER APPS. I promise u will lose my money I'm switching to an I pad :/ :( BTWS IF I COULD I. WOULD RATE IT AT 0
0345803493|2.0|This read left me flat. The expectation was 1 on a scale of 1-5. An imagination left to run wild; entertaining to some and porn to others. The popularity of book two escaped me even though having purchased the book in a 2/3 scenario.
0062238868|5.0|this was a very good book I enjoyed it a lot and it is written in a language everyone can understand
0345803507|3.0|Book three engaged more of a story line than book two. However, in-spite of all the popularity this trilogy inspired; this was definitely not an engaging read for this audience.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Love season collections so I got this one while on sale! About attorney office that these two men do things in an unconventional way.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enjoyed this book but do not think I will read others in the set. Children, do not like stories where children are the main character.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No directions are given on how to play this game. You just keep clicking and clicking and hope something happens...stupid
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Such a cute movie..my 3yr old daughter's go-to favorite!! Excited to be able to let her watch it on the iPad now!!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Found this to be super easy until 9th level then you had to give it some serious thought can't wait for next level.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Sheldon is awesome!  The whole cast just gets better & better.  My whole family watches this show.  We love it!
B0000C1733|5.0|This collection is near to perfect. I'd also love to see an updated version of Greatest hits (from latest albums).
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is the best series i have ever watched . It is bloody , but when you follow the story from the beginning and all the<br />different people mesh together for survival from they don't know what ???? It keeps you on the edge of your seat . You<br />just feel comfortable with the people who band together and in a flash ---they are gone . All of a sudden not only they<br />are fighting against the walking dead but other survivors who want to take away what the main group has fought for .<br />The acting is superb . Just when you pick a favorite something happens to them and they are gone & you are shocked<br />that it happened and realize when you are always in harms way there is nothing for sure ! There is enough action that<br />you couldn't doze off watching it even if you are dead tired . We watch a complete episode until late at night . We can't<br />wait to see what happens next . I hope there are many , many more seasons of the &#34;Walking Dead .----- Rich Mellinger

B00571F26Y|5.0|Very well written. Has some great recipes and trying some foods that I had never used before. It also makes you think about what you are eating and where it comes from. Eat fresh local produce whenever possible.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I find myself waiting for something to jump out at me and since I'm a spooky one as well, this is very enjoyable.
1476733953|5.0|What a great title! I didn't think that at first, but as this post-apocalyptic tale unfolded and I was drawn into the lives of the inhabitants of the silo world, I was fascinated, hooked.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes mysteries, learning secrets, and studying human nature. Why would someone do that?
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the greatest games of all time but, I just discovered the worst glitch ever! I have this HUGE theme park world in creative, it has a hotel, water slides, a carnival, a diner, and tons more. Then today I went to build something but my world was half ruined. It looked like the game just made huge cuts throughout the world and It took some of my stuff and cut it in half and switch he d stuff around. A lot of it is unfixable. It's horrible. I don't know how it happened... other than that it's an awesome game.....
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I just love Khaled Hosseini writing it completely opens my eyes to the other parts and cultures of the World! He is brilliant!!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Even as the decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall pass and dread memories of the Iron Curtain fade from our consciousness, a film like \\"The Lives of Others\\" has the quiet power to remind you that human evil, weakness, hope and despair are eternal themes. Too many other reviewers have lauded the movie's superb plot and characterizations for me to add anything new at this point. Simply, I was disturbed, depressed and yet gladdened to see how the lives portrayed in the drab GDR turned out by the end of the story. The Stasi captain Wiesler, who appears coldly methodical and assured in his work for the totalitarian state, is actually a lonely and sad individual. His job of listening in on the lives of the playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover Christa-Maria Sieland, far from securing the GDR against subversives, ends up diminishing him as a person. His work exposes him to the realization that his life is empty and hopeless. We see this only in snatches: a bit of mournful piano heard on his headphones induces tears; an encounter with one of his victims in a drab bar nearly forces him to blurt out his complicity; and his meetings with his superiors take on a growing desperation. Wiesler is playing a double game in a system where everything is rigged by the State. Everyone knows that the system collapsed in 1989, but the way individuals are made to suffer and suffocate is a strength of this film.<br /><br />One of the great things about \\"The Lives of Others\\" is how it treats life in a stifling environment like East Germany. The neighborhood where Dreyman lives and Wiesler sets up his listening post is a cold unwelcoming world where people walk mostly alone if they're visible at all. Streets are wide boulevards yet hardly any traffic is heard; the cars we do see are pathetic Trabants, emblems of the socialist economy. Black Volvo limousines are for Party officials, either for secret trysts or for meetings with underlings. The color palette is all muted grays, washed-outblues and sepias, as cheerless as the humans who shuffle about their day. This is not the sterile fluorescent world conjured up in Orwell's \\"1984,\\" it's a totally real and believable place where ordinary people try to go about their lives under the circumstances.<br /><br />There are three themes running through \\"The Lives of Others\\": the forlorn hope the playwright Dreyman shares with his colleagues that they can maneuver within the grip of the Stasi; the torment that Christa-Marie faces when she's forced to become a State informant; and the crack in Wiesler's veneer of allegiance to the State. It's this third theme that fascinates me the most, because, unlike the all-too human actors and writers he spies on, Wiesler is supposed to be professional, merciless and detached. I found myself alternately despising him and cheering him as he veers between Party loyalty and decency. I think the film raises the eternal question: how much suffering must apparatchiks like Wiesler inflict on others before he cracks? In the interrogation scenes we see uniformed guards whose garb eerily resembles the SS style that preceded it. You're reminded: oh yes, the GDR arose from the ashes of Nazi Germany: the same methods for a new era. Wiesler is the embodiment of the \\"I'm just doing my job\\" mindset that nourishes tyrannical governments. His boss, a worm of a man named Grubitz, is as ambitious and unremarkable as they come. We've seen many bureaucrats like him and his oafish Minister fade into the new world of a reunited Germany. But it's Wiesler, now humbled and marginalized as a delivery clerk, whom we're riveted to. When he and Dreyman intersect in the aftermath of the Communist era, it's a statement of redemption and hope that doesn't rely on a sappy happy ending.<br /><br />A few reviewers have observed that \\"The Lives of Others\\" is slow-paced and lacking action. Just like the dreary lives trapped in a Socialist paradise... I say, it's a subtle film, and subtle can be great.
125000098X|5.0|Great product - Great price - Great value!  I thought at this low price the product might not be as advertised but I was wrong it was just as advertised and in perfect shape.  Thanks Amazon you have done it again.
B006ISJQBM|3.0|Now, I didn't have HUGE hopes for this movie, so I wasn't overly disappointed, but neither was I thrilled to discover that it was actually good.  All I can say, it was better than I expected, but still not a movie I ever would have bought or watched if not for Johnny Depp being in it.<br /><br />\\"The Rum Diary\\" left me with the same feeling that \\"Fear and Loathing\\" did...hardly a shock, since they both revolve around the same author.  Once again, we are treated to a cynical and drunken (or high) (or both) view of the world, where most things turn out to be pointless.  However, the saving grace of this movie were the spectacular landscapes and the wonderful vintage cars and the beautiful actress who played Chenault, the love interest of the film.  The music was also really good.<br /><br />Kemp is a big time drinker with a checkered writing career (if you could call being a failed novelist a career) who goes to Puerto Rico to work for an ailing newspaper.  He hooks up with Sala, a photographer for the same paper and ends up rooming with him and his even stranger other roommate who also (sort of) works for the same paper.  He's probably the most oddly intriguing character in the show, though of course you never figure out how he got that way.<br /><br />What follows is a drunken (or high) ramble through all sorts of misadventures that are sometimes funny and sometimes not, with an occasional nod at a plot revolving around a secret real estate deal.  The gap between the rich who are exploiting the island and the poor is brought up a few times, but nothing really seems to come of it.  Just when you think something might get accomplished, that Kemp is going to take a stand or do SOMETHING other than get in and out of trouble and find the next high...it doesn't.  A lot of the plot seemed pointless.<br /><br />Again, this reminded me of \\"Fear and Loathing,\\" where if it wasn't Johnny Depp playing him, with all of his charm, I would so dislike the guy that I probably wouldn't have even finished watching the movie.  Which isn't to say that I hated the movie entirely, but I don't understand this fascination for pointless, essentially plotless writing.<br /><br />Warning, there is a lot of drug use in the movie (though it does show you what stupid things you can do and get into as a result) and if you would be squicked or offended by chicken-fighting scenes, then you might not want to watch it.
6305428050|5.0|just as described!
B00BGD8CFK|3.0|its an ok case. it looks good and feels solid all around. i think it needs about 1 mm more of &#34;table protection&#34;. matte finish is nice.<br /><br />only issue i have is that the screen lock button(for my iphone 5) becomes extremly hard to press with the cover on. also the jelly home buttons that come with the case are kinda lame and look nothing like the ones you see online.<br /><br />overall its decent for what you pay. just dont expect too much from it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It kept me reading so I could find out what the secret was. Nice to have something different to read.
1781162646|5.0|This quick read was in line with my favorite King works -- retro feel, simple story at its core, just a touch of supernatural elements rather than centered around them. I have been reading SK since I was 12. I'm now 44, and no matter how many types of books I enjoy (a lot of memoirs and literary fiction, mostly), there is no one who keeps me turning the pages deep into the night the way he does. Dreamland fits the bill.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This is an adult movie in my opinion, and I mostly enjoy the interesting<br />story line...can do without the gratuitous profanity!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a great fast paced game that keeps you on your toes!  It has a lot of other rooms you can advance to as you win.  I love the callers, they are all different and have different accents.  I never get bored with Bingo Blitz!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was not aware of the Orphan train practice and loved reading about this.  Those kids were survivors in a very difficult time in our country.  Great characters.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a really good book for book group....It prompted lots of thought provoking discussion.<br />I enjoyed the characters as well...
B00AYE8C70|3.0|Great for texting, however challenging for phone calls as you are dependent on the wi-fi strength.  I would recommend for all who travel.
818400060X|4.0|After Interpreter of Maladies, this is the second Jhumpa Lahiri book that I have picked up. Yes, at the risk of raising eyebrows from one and many, I have to admit that I haven't read The Namesake yet.<br /><br />The first story in the book is `Unaccustomed Earth' and I was lost in this book right from the first page and there's no use in pretending otherwise. The common theme in all these stories is that they narrate about the NRI lives and their everyday nuisance. Be it a mother daughter bonding, or the relationship between a man and his granddaughter or the unwanted helping hand of a well-wishing friend... again it may be about love or friendship or jealousy or abandonment... The stories visit different aspects of relationships and emotions with such a unique perspective that as a reader I questioned myself about a lot of it.<br /><br />Vivid characters live among these pages - characters you will recognize and characters you may even empathize with. They aren't extraordinary in their lives by any means, but it's the author's projection of them that make them seem extraordinary. In any other setting, I would have perhaps called for a bit more strength from some of the characters, but in these cases they were portrayed just right. Each trial and accomplishment of these characters felt like my own trials and accomplishments - such was the power of Ms.Lahiri's prose.<br /><br />I have had a couple of people telling me that they were a bit disappointed that some of the stories turned out to be depressing and so a word of advice for those who are yet to pick this book up (if there's anyone's left at all) -- Please do not expect the stories to be all sunshine and rainbow. The stories are closer to reality than fiction and in real life there's often no happily ever after.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Again they blow us away with the drama and gorgeous costumes on Downton Abbey. This immediately became my favorite shown on Season 1, and Season 2 does not disappoint. Filled with historical references, beautiful sets, and breathtaking costumes; this show has something for everyone.
B00B0CU2CI|2.0|I wish it was about Canada but it isnt, and the story drags and repetitious. The title is misleading. I was looking forward to<br />something like a James Michener novel , historic but lively.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Great app to use when watching videos you put on your tablet yourself. Can read a lot of different types of video formats.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|I'm no big movie critic and I LOVE silly action movies, but this movie made absolutely no sense. They just put in scenes because they looked cool. I almost didn't even finish watching it. This is almost as bad as Battlefield Earth which remains my all time worst movie ever. I guess this is number 2.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I have quite a few of his CD's which I love but I don't think this one is up to his standard.  I would still recommend it if you are a Rod Stewart fan.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is a story about one small town and a nearby small village and the interactions between the people in the two communities. The small village is populated with laborers who are barely surviving while the town is full of people who think they live in a sophisticated urban mecca. Brenden Coyle is in it and he plays a similar character to the famous Mr. Bates. However, his constant harping on his &#34;pride&#34; becomes annoying as the episodes go by. Still, the show is engaging and has a curious calming effect on the viewer.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I was so unaware of so many things that happened on that period and thanks to this book I learnt in a light way more of XXth century. Nevertheless, I prefered Fall of Giants.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Awesome show. I cant believe im watching it just now.season two is on the to do list. Kinda makes you want to get a bike and join a gang.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is beautiful on many levels and frighteningly truthful in respect of the human condition.  We  laugh, love, believe, We cry,hate, doubt. We live until we die,  with or without honor. John Green captures the essence of life, which is love.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I thought this book was good, but predictable.  It is definitely a tear jerker and made you grateful for a healthy life.  I felt like the ending dragged on and on and it took me a while to get through the last 10% of the book.

B00DM0XXCM|3.0|This movie needed more focus on theory surrounding the two worlds and a little less on the once-in-a-lifetime love that sets unrealistic expectations for young people.
0770437400|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It was really a war book - not science fiction.  Too bad the movie did not follow the book, it wouldn't have been much much better.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This book was engaging and very well written.  After I was done, I wanted to read and hear more.  To me, that's a sign of a good book!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The plot is derivative, the characters undeveloped stereotypes and the technology self-contradictory, but the action moves forward, albeit predictably. I am surprised at the success and the large number of glowing reviews.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Beautiful Disaster is out there on its own, it's really the first book people think of when NA comes to mind and it comes with a whole trunk full of controversy. I've seen this book on so many \\"Will-Not-Read-Due-To \\" shelves on Goodreads and I've read the rants and raves and to be honest was pretty intimidated starting this book. It's fiction but for some reason this book has become the poster child for dysfunction and liking it means liking dysfunction.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. I didn't expect to, NO-ONE expected me to but I liked it.<br /><br />If you don't know the story...Abby Abbernathy (that name kinda irritates me) is a \\"good girl\\" (she wears pink cardigans and pearls so that means she's a good girl apparently...wait I wear pink cardigans and pearls and I AM a good girl...okay McGuire well played with that one!) Anyway Abby is at an underground fight night (us good girls know how to party it on up!) and attracts the attention of *cue D-12 Fight Music* Travis \\"Mad-Dog\\" Maddox. Do you smell smoke? That's your loins on fi-yah! &lt;eye-roll><br /><br />So Abby and Travis become \\"friends\\" even though Abby has no clue why he likes her! Don't you hate those pretty girls who are all \\"Gosh! You want to take lil ol' me onto the porch for some lemonade?\\" Anyway it's total scandal in...umm Western? Northern? whatever the university is called because Travis is a \\"bang and run\\" type of guy and no girl's cooch is worth a second go round.<br /><br />Except...yup you guessed it Abby Abbernathy and her magic lady-garden is enough to make Travis give up the meaningless sex and become a \\"good man\\" and they lived happily ever after and are hereby deemed TRABBY...apart from the drinking, the fights and the most ridiculous sub-plot involving card sharks (is it sharks or sharps??) and the mafia. That re-cap might contain scenes created for entertainment purposes.<br /><br />So...you're probably wondering about the part where I said I liked it. I'm trying to remember...right! Travis! No I don't want to be \\"Mrs Maddox\\" and I'm going spoil something here but I really don't care but Abby gets a tattoo saying just that and oh my god, ya wanna lose weight? Just think about that every day and your appetite will disappear faster than Travis's lady-friends' panties!<br /><br />Anyway, Travis was the highlight for me. He was hilarious, I know he was supposed to be the hottest, most dangerous, bad boy on the planet but for me he cracked me up. There's one exchange where Abby says he has no standards and he says very seriously \\"First of all...I have standards! I've never been with an ugly woman. Ever\\"<br /><br />Be still my heart...I'm just going to take a minute and swoooooooon! Seriously though, Travis knows he's a douche, he owns it and yes he treats women like disposable (can't think of a word!) oh wait...condoms! But when you go home with a guy and he bends you over the couch rather than take you to the bedroom you have to know what you're getting yourself into. I mean surely the fact that he says \\"I bag them on the couch\\" is transparent enough. He's smart too (academically at least) which was a nice departure from the stereotype.<br /><br />Abby's relationship with Travis at times is the holy mother of dysfunction but overall there were a lot of sweet moments and Travis did treat her with respect and love.<br /><br />His willingness to use his fists is another story and one that has been re-hashed by many so I'm just going to say I do not approve. The morning after TRABBY sleep together has been dissected at length, people have freaked out over the fact that he trashed his apartment when he realised Abby had left. Not the nicest behaviour but if you're going to hit something I'd prefer a TV to be the victim than someone's face.<br /><br />Travis making Abby change clothes for a fight so he's not distracted was another not so fun moment for me but Abby changed her clothes rather than nut punch him which irritates me more.<br /><br />The thingthat interested me most about this book is all the drama, all the incidents that have proved controversial happen BEFORE TRABBY become a couple. There's this consensus that Travis's behaviour is appalling because he shouldn't do those things because it hurts Abby. Newsflash, if you're not together, you have no loyalty to that person romantically. Friends yes but they aren't a couple when any of the drama occurs so why the panty twisting? I also didn't get how invested Shepley and America (oh yeah there are other characters in the book) were invested in their (non) relationship to the point where they split up over the TRABBY drama.<br /><br />When they finally do get together, the sea calms and the boat stops rocking and their relationship is actually functional. Then comes the sub-plot in Vegas which was just ridiculous. It turns out Abby and me aren't truly sisters in the Good Girl Sorority and she's got this shady past and an idiot father and I skimmed a LOT.<br /><br />The last third of the book was my favourite, McGuire really knows how to inject emotion and the scenes at the Maddox house at Thanksgiving were really touching and tugged at the heartstrings. I really felt it was here that I connected with Travis and Abby as a couple and truly rooted for them. From then on the emotion heightens until the climax that really made me smile and possibly experience some feels and honestly made me truly enjoy this book!

B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Fun movie, but a little predictable.  There were some good special affects, but the costumes/affects for the bad guys left a little to be desired.  I was not expecting a 5 star movie, but still got a fun sci-fi adventure to enjoy.

B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Unfortunately the plot was quite predictable.  The special effects for blood, guts and gore were so overdone, it made me wonder if the director has some sick fascination of mutilating human bodies.  The acting was not bad, but not stellar either.  I gave it two stars instead of one just because I managed to watch the whole movie to see if/how the bad guys went down in the end.

1400067820|4.0|This was a challenging book to read to understand the concepts but definitely worth the effort.  Taleb claims to have found a relationship between volatile events and things that profit from them.  These things he labels antifragile, or the opposite of the things that are fragile, which are harmed by volatility.  (Please note that when reading Taleb, I have some sense of trepidation over the complexity of the material as he sometimes casually throws out difficult statistical and financial terminology.)  Antifragility is one point on a continuum, with resilient being the next (lower) lever, followed by fragility.  Taleb claims that not knowing antifragility causes a lot of problems in public policy and other areas as a result of naive interventionalism, or doing something because of the sense that something, rather than nothing, should be done.  He refers to iatrogenics, or the cause of harm by medical intervention, as an example. Often the body, ruled by all wise mother nature, can take care of itself if given time.  Unnecessary back surgeries are a good example of this.  Another major point that Taleb makes is that antifragility has been transferred to an elite group - bankers, policy makers, pundits - who have \\"no skin in the game\\", that is nothing to lose from their actions.  Taleb's prime example is the head of Citibank, who earned $104 million while bringing his firm into a position needing a bail out. Taleb also targets pundits who beat war drums or engage in other forms of cultural influence and also have nothing to lose.  He focuses here on the lack of integrity among these types of journalists and writers.  Taleb has other targets - academics divorced from action; universities seen as creating products and innovations, whereas these tend to come from entrepreneurs and tinkerers (with skin in the game), and others.  A great book to look at world events, policy decisions and even personal choices, from another and perhaps more lucid perspective.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Read in one day.  Get lose in another world.  Love the series, all the books are fun and quick reads.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The weather forecast s are pretty accurate. O just wish they included the local forecasts like they used to before I updated the app.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Fast paced action, scifi. Good plot and story. Well acted, great effects. Big machines, little machines all kicking rear and taking names.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|...and I do too! What a fun fun app! It's very realistic and has lots of practical features<br />Like grooming and and showing..
B005F2BBLK|4.0|JD pulled it off again, great movie with all the old western stars from the past made in to animatics character, old spaghetti westerns included. A very fun trip to the west. You even have the Judge and a mariachi band. Excellent!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|I LOVE Adele, and I have her cd's i listen on the internet, but listening to her on vinyl is absolutely a great experience! The record was brand new and delivered in perfect condition!
B00DP3IESY|4.0|This had poor critic reviews but like so many the critics say were so, so they were wrong again. It was great!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 7 year old loves this game he plays it all the time. Teaches him to count too and how to handle money as he has to make enough to buy and unlock other games.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Action, time line, straight from the comics I read as a kid and brought to like on the screen. Excellent effects.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|wonderful book, down to earth write..highly recommend it can help the most experienced to the beginner , I think it also has simplistic views for children .
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Great graphics and sound, but bugs are common.  They range from minor annoyances up to major issues, like the disappearance of your character and no response to your request for help.
B008469DGY|5.0|Simple, easy to play, quite fun. Thought I had completed the &#34;World Tour&#34; portion only to realize there was more to accomplish, so it has some good play time to it as well. Worth looking into if you want a simple game to play that will last a while. Not extremely demanding mentally, but still quite fun.
081095415X|5.0|Stunning photography, amazing imagery. Brandt moves well beyong the typical animal shot and conveys strength and grandeur mixed with fragility and sadness in a single frmae.
0316228583|4.0|This book is social commentary.  It is a hyperbole of misfortune and misunderstanding.  The book starts off dark, and things only move from bad to worse.  It isn't for those looking for a light hearted tale of life in the English countryside; it's grim, and it tackles grave topics, most of which have no clear answer or solution.<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy the book once I got into it, but it took some time to get the characters straight in your head.  However, once you know who it is you're reading about, the book really becomes engrossing.
B00200K2UG|5.0|I've got a ton of accessories. Being an owner of a D800 and A D700 with grips, a 50mm, 85mm, 24-70mm, 70-200mm, & 18-70... a ton of square filters, lens mounted filters, reflectors, cables, and a ton of other things... this bag makes for a perfect fit to carry it all... Including my laptop and charger... beyond worth the price.
B004GBFF5Y|3.0|I think the movie is decent. I didn't feel like I wasted my time but I also think it's tad overrated. Hard to explain what's good or bad about it... Just felt like there wasn't anything special.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Yes! Yes and Yes.  The plot and characters were believable.  The acting was superb. The special effects were first class.  I don't much like fighting movies and I was ready to NOT like this one.  But, the main character grabbed me right away.  I highly recommend this one.
0786956291|5.0|Great having lots of fun with friends now couldn't be any better than it is now. I love it yah!
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|Not bad as a piece of work.  But, by the 2/3 mark, I'd ceased to even care, watching the special effects instead.  The interplay between the Jewish woman and Brad's character was down played to the point where it didn't mater anymore.  A man with a hole through his belly and out the other side doesn't just walk 20 miles to get to the WHO.  Why isn't he being carried in a travois instead. Then it would have been believable.  It offended my desire to believe in the movie.  Special effect were top-notch, so I gave it a 4 star on that alone.  If you can escape the obvious to &#34;believe the plot&#34; it wasn't bad.  But it escaped my sensibility, so I couldn't give it that last star.  I never realized how frightening chattering teeth could be.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Absolutely love playing this game. Highly recommend it. If you like bingo games then you will love this one. The slots are fun also.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I know I'm a little late on this one, but I've played about 40 hours of Game Dev Story on both my IOS and Android devices.  It is a wonderful game.  You run a game development studio and make sweet video games.  What could be better than a video game where you make video games?  It's so meta!<br /><br />Where else could I create such gems as:<br />\\"Real Boobs\\" - Game Genre: Simulation, Game Type: Romance<br />\\"Fast Boobs\\" - Racing/Fitness<br />\\"Nerdy Boobs\\" - Online Sim/Bookstore<br />\\"Boob Hunter\\" - Shooter/Cutie<br />\\"Boobs?\\" Trivia/Art<br /><br />Alright, alright, enough examples of my genius.  As you can see, I'm very creative.<br /><br />Strong recommendash to use some kind of guide/wiki to figure out which of the combinations work the best.  I like all of the Kairosoft games quite a lot.  They excel in the \\"toilet-play\\" genre (copyright pending).  That is when you play games while you're on the toilet.  Anyway, give it a try, you'll thank me now and later.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book really reminds me of middle school when revenues ends as we as s Saddam's. None led slams sk
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I had my reservations about this game. But after seeing the excitement of my six year old son playing this game, I changed my mind. Because he plays it on the kindle and uses his hand, it has helped in strengthening his fine motor reflexes as well.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Even tho I get lags and stuff this is a great game to pass the time I love it :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can't get enough of this game!  My daughter and I will play it for hours on end. Waiting anxiously to get more coins.
B00009EJC5|4.0|Good CD, some of the songs I remembered, others I did not and the insert was very informative on how JB and his band selection were involved.
1565234243|5.0|the whole book is what the cover would make you expect. if you only *wished* to be a carver, you would drool over this book. worth every penny and a dollar more. shows you everything but where to get the wood and how to sharpen tools.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|After reading other reviews of Season 1 of Orphan Black, I purchased it as soon as I could and binge-watched it with very high expectations. Well, it exceeded those expectations. Especially impressive is the acting of star Tatiana Maslany. Hard to believe I didn't know who she was before. I don't want to add any spoilers. Check other reviews for more details. Watch it...you'll love it!
0307165485|5.0|and this one is huge, and has full length stories. ask any parent who was smart enough to buy scarry's books.  my 40 yr old son remembers them fondly. none better. beats seuss by a mile.
0694003611|5.0|Our twins love this book, it's always the last one we read before putting them to bed.<br /><br />It has a nice pace, great illustrations and plenty of chances for mom and dad to add sound effects, gestures and other customizations.<br /><br />I just wish they had a larger version for reading to 2 kids at once.
0307155102|5.0|my 40 yr old son still remembers scarry's books fondly. they are timeless. any parent will tell you how much the children loved them, and therefore educated themselves with them. a lesson in every word, with wit for parents cleverly woven in. beats seuss hands down.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|This book was an instant hit with our 7 month year old twin girls.  It's got nice simple rhymes, cute clear pictures and lots of chances for daddy and mommy to improvise gestures and sound effects.<br /><br />Goodnight Moon still edges it out with the girls but this is a close #2.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is so wonderfully different yet set in Mumford and Sons' style. I listen to this over and over.
0345529057|4.0|If you like the HBO series and you like to read series books then you should really enjoy this collection.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The 2nd reboot installment is an action Packed Star Trek adventure that you just have to have!!! Excellent movie for your action collection!!
B0011MZOEI|5.0|I love it when the good guys win. I always enjoy Bruce Willis paying one of my favorite characters, big bad John.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Reading this felt like a year in prison. It felt like an un-edited journal, with lots of repetition. And, despite it being in prison, it ultimately seems like nothing really happened.
B005LAII3A|5.0|This movie is a must &#34;see!&#34;  Action packed and full of suspense! I enjoyed the forst Total Recall with Arnold schwarzenegger and this one follow suit in being a great movie as well.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Great app from Google that takes you right to your gmail account and access to everything you need to send, read, modify anything needed.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I lived in Denver for a couple of years, from 2008 to 2011.  'Fringe' premiered about that time, but I was so distracted with work, new friendships and relationships that I totally missed the first seasons.  It is very reminiscent of how, for a time, EVERYBODY used to set aside their Friday night to catch the latest episode of The X Files.  In fact, there HAS to be some kind of crossover since both were somehow spawned by the FBI when it inevitably encountered events revealing that some crimes have their roots in the far-fetched and the bizarre.  'Fringe' seems to be an evolutionary product of The X Files.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I live this app and truly enjoy the content that is centered around what I want to read & can remove blogs that aren't my style. Great for creating your own blog with step by step instructions!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Good quality free game. But beating the computer is not easy, but I am glad for the challenge. Too easy would make it no fun.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Special effects are good.  Plot became too predictable and the ending was plausible but predictable.  Good if you like Tom Cruise.
0142422010|4.0|\\"Just because something isn't practical doesn't mean it's not worth creating. Sometimes beauty and real-life magic are enough.\\"<br /><br />I was so glad I read this book throughout a weekend where Monday was a holiday, else I'd have to force myself to stop and get some sleep, and yet it would be one of those nights where I'd end up tossing and turning thinking about the book until the wee hours of the morning. And in the process of getting myself off the bed and preparing to go to work, I'd be mumbling to myself that I should have just stayed up all night finishing the book since I didn't get much sleep anyway. Yup, perfect timing.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is one of those books that I enjoyed more because of the minor characters rather than the main protagonists. Don't get me wrong, I like Lola and Cricket, but I just adore Lola's Dads, I really have a soft spot for fathers, straight or gay. Nathan and Andy made reading through this book really fun. I love how protective they were towards Lola, much to her aggravation.<br /><br /> Plus Etienne and Anna being here added more entertainment to the story. I love how they are more relaxed and affectionate now since all the drama from Anna and the French Kiss has long passed on. Did I mention how witty Etienne St. Clair was? Seriously, he made things all the more interesting!<br /><br />Lola's passion with her costumes is admirable considering she's at the age where everything seems so confusing, and these are the times where you'd want to find a click of friends where you would belong and truly feel wanted. It is also at that age where quirky little things about you would be seen as weird and made fun of. So I was really proud to see Lola staying true to what she believes in and does what she wants even though some people tend to tease her about it.<br /><br />Cricket is a nice guy, maybe even too good for his own sake, but I like how supportive he was with Lola, and he is such a sweet guy. But he's just not my type. I like my guys rough and rogue-ish. Cricket's metro-sexual demeanor is just not the type of guy I'd be drooling over. Still, I'm happy for him and Lola.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door may not be the kind of love story I'm attuned to, but there is definitely more to this book than just that. I think the highlight I saw in this book was the lesson of embracing who you are and what you love. Being passionate about something can truly take you places if you add dedication and resolve to the mix.my type. I like my guys rough and rogue-ish.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I love the writing style of Hosseini, and he doesn't disappoint in this respect. However, the story, which starts out strong and captivating, diverges into what I felt was more like vignettes, disrupting the main story and not really adding any substance to it. Those &#34;vignettes&#34; could easily be skipped over and the main storyline would move along just fine. I really wish, though, he would have fully developed the mini story of the warlord and woven it into the main plot. THAT could have been fascinating. Nevertheless, I did overall enjoy the book and I'll read the next novel Hosseini writes.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is very mysterious and so addicting!<br />I love this series so much and the shows too ! -A
B00F35BV64|4.0|I enjoyed the original series its makes me wish there was still a TV show I miss the days of good Sci Fi.
1451675046|5.0|I have read several other books by Richard Dawkins, (The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker and The God Delusion), and he never ceases to amaze and educate me in the &#34;facts and truth of reality.&#34;  In a very clear and simple (Too easy and too simple at times), way this fantastic book explains the unique differences between magical thinking and scientific evaluations.<br /><br /> Even though I suspect Mr. Dawkins wrote this book for children, adults who also believe in magical answers also need to read this educational book. He emphasizes truthfully, that real magic is how our universe began and how life evolved over billions of years.  Each chapter begins with a question followed with a mystical ancient story and he than explains the factual scientific answer.  There are 12 interesting and informative chapters.  They include the following:<br /><br />Chapter 1:  What is reality?  What is magic?  2. Who was the first person?  3. Why are there so many different kinds of animals? 4. What are things made of? 5. Why do we have night and day, winter and summer? 6. What is the sun? 7. What is a rainbow? 8. When and how did everything begin? 9. Are we alone? 10. What is an earthquake? 11. Why do bad things happen? 12. What is a miracle?<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the kind of book that is so interesting that it keeps you turning the pages.  This book should be required reading for all students, teachers, and anyone else who is tempted to believe in mystical and illogical answers for how and why the world works in reality.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.

If you have a usb port on your TV then you won't even have to have external power.  Instant Netflex. If you have great internet service then you can feed the TV, and watch 4-8 screens of a NASCAR race at the same time.  While on another laptop watching a netflex movie.  The software is totally automatic once you go to there (Google Chromecast) website.  Buy it you will love it.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|My friend has a different model of this brand, a slimmer more pocket friendly version that I highly recommend as well. I bought this one because my phone frequently dies halfway through the day, it is the same shape/size as my phone so I can hold it and the phone together when I need to answer it, and because the wire tucks away when not in use. It comes with adapters as well so you can use it for iphone or android devices.<br /><br />I've been using it for about a week now, and it works great. I get an extra charge a day, and I'll stick it into the wall to charge itself back up every other day. The casing scratches up easily, as I stick it in the same pocket as my keys, but since it's just a battery charger I don't really care how it looks anyways. Not too heavy for the power of the battery too, and convenient lights let you know how much life it has left. I haven't gotten into testing specifically how long the battery lasts, but I have a Galaxy s2 that lasts maybe 4 hours when being used frequently throughout the morning, and this thing will charge my phone nearly 4 times.<br /><br />Cons: It heats up in your pocket a lot. Not to the point of burning or anything, but you can definitely tell it is there and that makes it a bit uncomfortable. Would be really useful in the winter time though, and anyone with a purse or bag wouldn't really care about this. Also, like I said, it scratches easily, but I'm also putting it in a pocket that's being knocked around with metal keys and a pocket knife. The size could be a con to some, but since it's the same size as my phone I don't mind.<br />Pros: Quick service, looks great, does its job. Highly recommend anything from this brand even if you don't like this particular model. They make slimmer ones with built-in flashlights too.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Spoiler alert: This movie spoiled my appetite.<br /><br />If you want to see an exciting starship chase scene, or, a lot of CGI explosions, and, a hottie in her underwear, this movie is for you. In other words, you fit the target audience, which probably considers the original Star Trek series too slow and \\"cerebral.\\" That is, you're likely between 13-23 years old and don't remember that Star Trek wasn't just about things exploding (at least, for the most part).<br /><br />That said, if this wasn't labeled \\"Star Trek,\\" and was just a sci-fi action movie, it would've been a perfectly fine one. It's just saddening to people who've grown up with the original concept to see what it has degenerated into -- just another shoot-em-up in space. Note to J.J.: could you have made this movie without making each of these well-known characters a cartoon-image of what they were? No? Then why make a \\"Star Trek\\" movie? Oh wait...it sells, because the kids will want to see that underwear scene, and things going \\"boom,\\" and, the millions of people who're already in love with what ST used to be will give it one more chance because they're desperate for a new ST film. It's ingenious.<br /><br />Spock: Used to be Spock. Thank heaven this guy can still look stoic, because that's where the similarities end.<br /><br />Kirk: Is a wuss. He can't figure out that he's a leader? How about choosing a job besides Starship Captain?<br /><br />Uhura: Yeah, now she's a central figure...which means she has finally fulfilled Nichelle Nichol's deluded fantasy that the communications officer was something more than a receptionist on the original Star Trek.<br /><br />McCoy: Someone tried to be McCoy at least.<br /><br />Scotty: Gets drunk onscreen. A nod to us old ST fans. See, this film has something for everybody!<br /><br />Chekov, Sulu: Who cares?<br /><br />And, KHAN: Oh, MAN, they made Kahn a homicidal maniac cyborg! Great! Wasn't it cool when he smashed that guy's head? Ricardo Montalban was waaaayyy to boring a Kahn -- THIS one smashes heads! Yay!<br /><br />One more thing...please, when you make \\"Star Trek 3: The Final Milking of a Beloved Franchise,\\" exclude a Leonard Nimoy cameo. He looked as embarrassed to be in this trash as I felt paying to watch it.

1455526959|4.0|I listened to \\"The Black Box\\" on audio, and the reader does a very good job, though he can't quite fill the shoes of Len, who gives a Harry an incredible voice and personality in the volumes he has covered. As for the actual content of the novel, I was treated to another great crime story by Connelly, featuring my favorite hard boiled detective. I was a little let down that this book didn't follow up where the last novel (\\"The Drop\\") left off, making no references to all the craziness that was stirred up with Irving and the serial killer that Bosch stopped, but this does not mean that I didn't enjoy it. \\"The Black Box\\" is still a fantastic crime story, and it was interesting to see how Connelly decided to tie it in to the 1992 L.A. riots. He really put his mind to use, connecting it to Harry's current assignment in the Open Unsolved Unit. Ultimately, this is more or less a standalone Bosch file, the repercussions of which do not seem to affect the overarching plot arcs too much.

B00EF460ME|5.0|This is a easy to use sound optimizer, set the EQ to your preference and choose your bass boost level.  (You can turn either function on and off while music is playing to hear the difference) You won't believe how the Fire's already great sounding speakers come to life with added fullness and crystal clear highs.  When you listen through headphones you would swear your are hooked a full size stereo system.  Try the free version you won't be disappointed, when I heard the difference this app made I immediately purchased the full version to unlock all of the options.  I also have a Toshiba Thrive that the app works equally well with.

Check out her new collaboration with Ted Leo (they're calling themselves &#34;The Both) - when that album debuts, it will be spectacular.<br /><br />Not much advantage of ordering the old school CD over the digital copy.  Leaflet is decorated in the same vein as the cover, two songs per page with no additional info other than lyrics (unlike some of her other albums).
