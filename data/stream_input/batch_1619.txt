B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades is an enjoyable book, giving me different venues to explore.  The first book was a little too intense for me but the second book gave me more romance and the third puts it all togrther..but I have not finished raeding it yet so I must go
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I wasn't ever planning on watching this movie, but I broke down and rented it to see what all the hype was about.what did I find? A 2 1/2 hr snoozefest, many other reviewers have said much better then I can, but I'll give it a go. I thought the movie seemed to long and yet for the length of the film you never really get to know or care about the characters.The cinematography was well to my mind just plain horrid, I hate *shake-cam*.Now for all of you, who would tell me to read the books. I ask you, why should I have to read the book first to 'get' the ins and outs of the story? Even if it's movie one of a trilogy it should be able to stand on its own, no homework required.

B0073XV2W2|5.0|Daniel Suarez has quickly become one of my favorite authors.  In Kill Decision, as with his other novels (Daemon and FreedomTM) he mixes enough fact and current events with the story to make it seem more like a documentary than a far-out techno-thriller.  Some reviewers claim he doesn't know what he is talking about and is too far fetched, but I feel just the opposite.  It is obvious that he does a ton of research into the subjects he brings into the story, but at the end of the day he is writing fiction and he is free to stray away from the facts as it fits his vision of the story.<br /><br />Kill Decision is not related to his previous books, so this book can be read before the others.  This story starts out with the USA being blamed for an attack upon a Middle Eastern pilgrimage site by unmanned drones.  The USA has no knowledge of the attack even though the drone appears to have the correct markings to be military drones.  The USA begins to experience terrorist bombings, which are actually drone attacks thought to be in retaliation for the supposed original attack.  As the plot develops the origins of both attacks are far more sinister than originally thought.<br /><br />This was a book that kept me up reading way too late in the evenings, and consequently I finished it in only a few days.  If you want a good exciting story that makes you think about where our society is heading with drones flying in the USA, this is the book for you.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Bought this one mainly for my new Joovy Caboose stoller. Who would have thought that a $125 stroller didn't come with an organizer!  Fits well but only complaint is after 2 days of use, the stitches are coming off. It's not falling apart but found some threads coming loose. Maybe a got a bad one, who knows.

B0094K1PW4|5.0|This is a very good movie.  I didnt know what was going to happen next.  The bonus of it was that it took me back to 1979 when I was a kid of the same age. I even liked the zombie movie at the end.  Great movie, must watch.

1439165653|2.0|Be easy to use lots of edible puns here<br /><br />This was a fun, light read. There was lots to keep a foodie interested and it was a colourful journey taken by the main character. It started in India and wound up in France so there was an interesting international diversity in both setting and cuisine.<br /><br />The characters tended to be more caricature than complex. The author states that he would love this to be made into a movie and I feel that this was his aim in writing. So it is vivid and flamboyant and quirky and distinctive enough to make a fine film ... but, as a read, it needed more seasoning (ooops ... a food pun).
030758836X|5.0|Loved this book. Such a good mystery, could not put it down untill I found out what happeded.Loaned it to a friend to read because I know she will love it too.
0307341550|3.0|Dark and nasty ... avoid small towns<br /><br />So glad that I was introduced to Gillian Flynn through Gone Girl.  This one didn't do it for me ... maybe because I was on to the perp half way through so the ending was no surprise.  Or maybe because I felt it wallowed a little in the middle just padding things out which was odd because I felt that the ending was far too rushed.  In general I felt it was a little overwritten.<br /><br />I do think that Flynn does wonderful \\"nasty\\" ... both plot twists and characters ... and I love the fact that she doesn't shy away from flawed, and rather unlikable, very dysfunctional, female characters.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|No surprises here. Suspend belief as Liam Neeson courageously, methodically, and efficiently tracks down nasty Eurotrash and eliminates them with nary a scratch until the end. See him arrive home victorious, with no mention of any repercussions from shooting the wife of a French Big Shot to get his point across. I guess the French were all, \\"Oh, you crazy American!\\" and knew it had to be done. Predictable, yet fun to watch- who doesn't like to see an Albanian electrocuted with a home made electric chair? Perfect set up for a sequel- they get the ex-wife next. In the third one, they take his faithful dog,  Shutzengel. To make it interesting, the dog will be carrying Atomic Secrets in his collar.
0756991145|5.0|Awesome! Just loved it!!!<br />And now I think I'll have to read some Dickens!<br /><br />This has been sitting on the bookshelf for ages ... so I am so glad that I have made January \\"Paperback Month\\" to catch up on unread purchases.<br /><br />This was a delight ... yet it was about horrible, horrible things.<br /><br />It was beautifully written, though for the most part I worried about the inappropriateness of the \\"voice\\". I felt a similarity to \\"Caleb's Crossing\\" where I didn't believe in the voice of the character narrating the events. In Mr Pip, I questioned the voice of the 15yo native girl telling the story ... but that all becomes clear at the end.<br /><br />This is set in Bougainville. I found it frightening, enlightening, to know about this horrible recent history and wanting to know how complicit Australia was/is. This is a disturbing read ... it should come with a warning label! ... I was so taken by surprise/shock as events unfolded.<br /><br />The main character is the last remaining white man on the island who teaches the children through his love of Dickens, in particular \\"Great Expectations\\". So now I have to add that to my reading list and do a bit of Google research.
B0083EW97W|4.0|Preface: John Mayer is talented, but I'm not an acolyte. That being said, I think Born and Raised is a quality/solid effort. I liked the track Shadow Days the few times I had heard it. After listening to some of the song samples I wound up purchasing the MP3 album and I am glad that I did. The music overall is quality stuff. I think JM has tuned into a point of view that many posses but you don't often see represented in an authentic heartfelt way. The stand out tracks for me are Born and Raised \\"I cant retrace how I got here...\\", \\"I got a mom, I got a dad, but they do not have each other...\\". Whiskey \\"I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place...\\", \\"dreamed somebody missed me...\\", and my favorite If I Ever Get Around to Living (good intro) \\"you been spending all your time searching for a sign that's never gonna look the way you want it...\\".  Face to Call Home has a nice harmony. Walt Grace has a nice vocal cadence as well. Something Like Olivia & Love is a Verb are good adult contemporary but not ones I would seek out on my iPod.<br /><br />Do I think every track is a slam dunk stand out? No. However, BnR is a solid effort and all the tracks are very listenable. With lyrics touching on loneliness and regret in a deeply personal (in places) and real way, I think BnR appears simple on the surface, but reveals its depth as you revisit the songs, both lyrically and instrumentally.
0143038095|3.0|It took a while ... but I came to appreciate it.<br /><br />Once again, because I have read some excellent literature that uses change of voice vividly (for example : \\"Cloud Atlas\\" or \\"A Visit From The Goon Squad\\" or \\"Room\\"), I found this a bit of a trial at the beginning as it was not well done. At times it was difficult to tell who was the storyteller and the time period of the story ... there are multiple vignettes told in flashback to the daughter's childhood and the mother's childhood ... as well as anecdotes and histories from the other members of the Joy Luck Club. It really took me till the last third to feel involved in the storyline.<br /><br />In the long run, it was a good book. It covers Asian/American + Mother/Daughter relationships well. I am glad I read it ... it was enjoyable ... by the end. But I have others of a similar ilk that I prefer.
B007X76Y58|4.0|The mood of this album is much closer to the sound of Gahan's solo albums and SOFAD than recent Depeche albums.  I've listened to it about 4-5 times, and this album feels more like an... album rather than a collection of songs.  Meaning, I like the music, but I really haven't been able to distinguish the tracks from each other (aside from \\"Longest Day\\".)  It is slow, gothic, and full of strings.  Again, if you're a fan of Gahan's solo work or SOFAD, there's a good chance you'll like this album too.
B000HT3JNY|4.0|I don't think CLICK did well in the box office, so I didn't expect much. But it turned out to be a pretty good flick with funny moments.
0525953728|5.0|An easy, informative, and exciting read. Well done: exceeding ALL standards, like everything else in the author's life of extraordinary service. The fuss about imaginary secrecy is best forgotten by outsiders: more important problems to be dealt with today, when other former SEALS have so recently given their lives. I for one have more productive things to do than criticizing a man who put a round or two in Osama. The special operations community can handle this controversy quietly on their own. We will need another generation of such men. My favorite military euphemism from this book is \\"re-engaging\\" down terrorists during an assault. Quite fitting, but only under those unique circumstances. I trust these professionals to do the right thing. Also enlightening are the extremely lawyer-like rules of engagements during raids in Afghanistan. As a former interogator there, I often wondered why we were able (or forced) to take so many prisoners. Now I know: the targets felt quite safe that they would be taken alive and released later. I know that these special operators used great restraint when on capture missions. God bless them one and all. Don't eat your own. The author knew he would be taking some flack from some colleagues, and says so directly in his book.
B004MYF4SS|2.0|most of the book is looking back at the characters childhood and youth... long chapters of too much irrelevant story. I was really disappointed, as the actual mystery and looking for the murderer fell far too short. I started skimming and skipping to get a bit of suspense, but that is not really what one pays for.
0385344333|1.0|I am a huge fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher. But this book left me wondering if it was indeed Jack Reacher's latest exploit. It was not the conventional Reacher I knew and loved. The story is not a page turner, the narration was a drab and in the end, if it was not for the love of Reacher, I would have closed the book mid way through and not pick it up again.<br /><br />Lee Child is one author I do not even read an excerpt before picking the book, for he is so entertaining. I looked forward for Reacher novels, knowing that I am about to enter into a world that is filled with his menace that only he can provide in his principled way. I hope the next book shall not disappoint, whenever it comes out!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|It took me a long time to get around to Bob Dylan. It's not that I was unaware of him;  I think I've owned his Greatest Hits since high school, but mostly because I thought I was supposed to. I knew that a lot of what I was listening to was somehow indebted to him, but I fell prey to the oft-repeated reason for respecting but not really enjoying his music - his voice.<br /><br />But, when Love and Theft was released in 2001, I was mesmerized. I heard \\"Mississippi\\" on the radio in Birmingham (yeah, really!) and was struck by how little nasally whine was left in the vocals, replaced by what? gravel? exhaust? burning pine straw? And, those pounding, perfectly paired guitars on Lonesome Day Blues?! I couldn't believe this was the same guy I only barely tolerated on Greatest Hits.<br /><br />To be fair, he's not the same guy. (Who is the same after 34 years?) And, certainly songs like \\"Watching the River Flow\\" sound surprisingly similar to what would come on Love and Theft, and as I would later discover, guitar geniuses like Robbie Robertson and Mark Knopfler had been a critical piece of some of his best records and tours.<br /><br />But, this is a review of Tempest, so why the meandering background check involving my introduction to later-life Dylan and specifically, \\"Love and Theft?\\" Because, among his late-career resurgence (which, interestingly, corresponds roughly with the appearance of his slightly goofy, pencil-thin mustache) Tempest sounds the most like Love and Theft. Its tone, tempo, and sonic landscape mimics that record, and that's a phenomenally good thing.<br /><br />Time Out of Mind and Modern Times are unquestionably great records, and Together Through Life is much more than anyone should expect from any 68 year-old singer-songwriter, were they not Bob Dylan. But, what I've come to believe is that years from now, Love and Theft and 2012's Tempest will be the one's mentioned in the same sentence as Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde, and Blood on the Tracks.<br /><br />Starting with the vocals, Rob Sheffield said in his terrific Rolling Stone review of Love and Theft in 2001 that Dylan's voice sounded like, \\"the last few creaky floorboards gave way.\\"<br /><br />Were the floorboards to have fallen out of Roy Orbison's voice before he  died, it would have been tragic, but with Dylan, it becomes an opportunity to write songs in a completely new direction. He turns to vaudeville and Burlesque and maybe even a little boogie and swing, while still singing the blues, telling stories of love gone wrong, love that becomes violent, death, loss, and even historic catastrophe.<br /><br />The title track is a 14-minute interpretation of the sinking of the Titanic. In it Dylan name drops Leonardo Di Caprio, because how can any among us imagine this actual event without remembering how Rose survives and Jack slowly dies of hypothermia? And, what of the title, \\"Tempest\\", Shakespeare's last play? Is Dylan predicting the future or just toying with us?<br /><br />No one could argue that Bob has ever been a great singer in the classical sense - try playing \\"All I Really Want to Do\\" to an uninitiated listener by telling them you want them to hear one of the truly great singers of all time. But, listen to the melody and phrasing of \\"My Back Pages\\" or \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" - that cat can sing! The rocker \\"Narrow Way\\" substantiates this on the new record. In the middle of a song full of religious allusions, contemplations seemingly about the path to God, observations about the nature of evil, and a strange historical reference to the burning of the White House, he makes you laugh out loud with a line about a girl's breasts.<br /><br />And, it's not just the line itself that's so funny, it's his punctuation, his timing, his busted tire of a voice singing about a sexual rendezvous that an 8th-grade boy might envision.<br /><br />Dylan aficionados and musicologists will find much to discover and digest here. Pour yourself a glass of bourbon and settle down in front of your record player and tube amp. But, if you're new to Bob and wanting to find out what all the fuss has been about these last 50 years, Tempest would be a lovely place to start. After you download it, put on those crappy white earphones, and work backwards in the catalog. Sure, it will take you a while to get to the \\"music will never be the same\\" records of the 60's, but beginning with Tempest you might be a bit more open-minded about his voice when you get to \\"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight\\", or \\"Lay Lady Lay\\", or \\"All Along the Watchtower.\\"e down in front of your record player and tube amp.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book, as well as the series is just a story. I dont think a lot of people can get past that. Yes, there are some obscene, sexual and rude parts, but if you can read through them I am sure you will appreciate the characters and their story.<br />This is basically, Twilight Fan Fiction, which was just that. However, seeing some simularities between Fifty Shades and Twilights characters, they aren't exactly the same. Ana and Christian can hold their own in this series and stray away from Bella and Edward in Twilight.<br />I enjoyed this book. It was an easy read and it introduced me into a world that I would never take part in, but was happy to be a bystander and get lost in their story.

I think she was wonderful in the character she played as Margaret Hale. I was disappointment that the episodes did not continue in season 1 past the forth episode four because I would have enjoyed more. Mr. Thornton shows also how easy that fortune can be lost.  Both characters show how love can rise above it.

B005LAIHE0|2.0|This film is much too cutesy, improbable and slow to develope.  The characters themselves are continuously smiling or laughing and they are basically stereotyped cutouts.

B002BI6SMI|2.0|Unfortunately, your thinking is all about how farcically preposterous the whole thing is.<br /><br />To be honest, there is nothing that Liam Neeson's character does during any 4-second interval of the film that is not believable.  Taking all his actions together, though; that's where the absurdity comes in.<br /><br />One might argue that this is meant to be a fast-paced thriller that will provide a couple of hours and entertainment and nothing more.  But for my part I couldn't lose myself in this movie on account of being unable to believe that Liam Neeson could be this sort of man, or that anybody in the world had such a skill set.<br /><br />I wonder what the French thought of this film:  it was almost an insult to their culture.

The camera recognized it as an SxS card, and we recorded a lot of video without any problems. This is a fabulous alternative to the very expensive Sony SxS cards.

0307959856|1.0|The setup sounds like a tantalizing whodunnit: the Darcys are to host a ball at their palatial estate. Guests will arrive from across the country for the annual fete.<br /><br />What a great setting for a murder mystery!: a crowded party in an isolated country estate where it will be hard to account for everyone's whereabouts and alibis. Deliveries will come and go all day, extra staff will be brought in, and drunken revelers will sneak off onto the grounds for trysts and into shadowy corners for hushed arguments. I thought I was in for a Regency Era spin on Gosford Park.<br /><br />I expected a mid-party discovery of a body. I expected that while the proper authorities would be called, that shrewd Lizzie would take it upon herself to follow up on suspicions to discover the murderer before the guests could disperse to their homes all across England. Perhaps family honor would be at stake and she would have to piece things together before the murderer could potentially escape forever.<br /><br />But instead, the murder anticlimactically occurs on the eve of the ball (which is subsequently cancelled) with a bare minimum of suspects. Instead of a whodunnit in the tradition of Christie, the story unfolds like an episode of Law & Order. The English legal process is dryly explained at length. We hear witnesses repeat the same testimony time and again. The resolution is at once a deus-ex-machina (a sudden confession..) and dully expected (...which has been indiscreetly foreshadowed).<br /><br />Even more disappointing, though, was the poor quality of writing and the bland representations of characters we know and love. Austen populates her novels with the good, the bad, and the silly. The actions of the bad (like Wickham) and the silly (like Collins) spur the plot forward, leaving the good to sort things out with wit and grace. In James' voice, however, we lose this delicate balance and all of the characters fall into one category: the dully polite. Several years of marriage seemed to have robbed Lizzie of her acerbic wit, while other characters -- like Colonel Fitzwilliam -- seem to have undergone total personality transplants in order to suit the needs of the writer. When James (who has an affinity for the passive voice) does make direct references to her source material, it's heavy-handed and feels like an afterthought just so that she can touch upon characters (such as Charlotte or Lady Catherine) who aren't involved in this story.<br /><br />James prefaces the novel by apologizing to Austen for subjecting her characters to a scandal. She should extend that apology to her readers for subjecting us, too, to a butchering.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love Quell.  I think this one is a little easier than the regular Quell, but both are really great.  Both of my kids (8 and 5) love to play too.
0425263908|5.0|This book is a great book.  This story really develops and gives away just enough to make you want to keep reading.  You will fall for the main characters.  I CANNOT wait until the last two books are released.
0375842209|4.0|Loved this book!  I could have kept reading had it been twice as long.  A quick read.  Having Death as a narrator is so unique and it was interesting to hear a WWII/Holocaust-related story that focuses on non-Nazi Germans during that time, for a slightly different perspective.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Love this show cant wait to get the sencond season, I am buying the books not just the dvds. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a really fun game. It has really easy controls: Tap and hold down to fly. It has so many different gadgets,jetpacks and clothes that you can wear. When you finish the game you are not done for good instead you can start over and earn a medal for doing so. The difficulty increases each time you start over. There are lots of fun objective and missions to complete. It is a really fun game and it never gets old.
0786891416|4.0|Enjoyed the book from beginning to end. Expecting to buy other books of this series. I also enjoy the TV series therefore looking forward to receiving the next series...
0525953728|5.0|Enjoyed the book tremendously.  SEALs are great American heros who sacrifice much to protect America everyday.  Loved the reference to to Joe Biden as the \\"drunk uncle\\" at Christmas dinner.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|I've always enjoyed Paramore since I first encountered them in Guitar Hero World Tour. This is the first time I decided to purchase an album of theirs, mostly because I had MP3 credit from other purchases. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the album is from start to finish. So good, I was surprised when it ended. I primarily listen to music while studying between college classes and thus never realize what I'm listening to has looped when it's really good. It wasn't until Ignorance came back around did I realize it ended. Good stuff.
0312427646|5.0|The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennett is an absolute riot.  It is a small, thin book, only 120 pages.  As a matter of fact, I wish it was longer.  This is a book which is obviously about Queen Elizabeth and the fact that she has started to read.  When I first read that I thought so what, she has started to read.  Isn't that something most people have done all of their life?  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially the use of English phrases that are just delightful.  It also has a surprise ending.  A most enjoyable book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Highly recommeneded! Everyone should give this game a try. It's addicting and the visuals are amazing. Loving every part of it!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Interesting novel. I wondered about his sanity at times.<br />It did expose him to many different people along his way<br />to his destination. Overall, enjoyed the novel, found it<br />ran a tad slow at times. A lesson in dedication & determination.
1439192812|5.0|This is such a wonderful book I'm so glad I purchased. Very refreshing to have science this easily explained. After reading the God Delusion, I was definitely hooked on his writings. This book really nicely illustrated and very informative. I almost feel I learned more about science in this book than I did in all my years of high school. Highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 was spectacular!  The actors, costumes, scenery, all were excellent!  Everyone should watch it again and again!  Best miniseries ever!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Very entertaining. A game in which u want a bit more history to (why dId Barry steal the jetpack) but does not take away from the addiction of experimenting with items bought in \\"the stash\\"
B008BIZ06M|4.0|I am an Offspring fan and have most of their work from way back.  Although I think their last CD is better, with the exception of a couple tracks I thought this CD was well worth the price.

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|So beautiful, magical & passionate!!!<br />One of the best movies of 2012, no question about it. Haters should refrain of giving those shallow reviews...
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Sorry I bought 2 of these but I went with the original, old model because the shaft is stronger than the newer G2 model.  Ours snapped right in half.<br /><br />What I forgot about was with the original, old model it is a pain to dump the waste because you have to take the bottom tray off and dump it into the garbage can, hoping you don't spill it all over the place.<br />This doesn't happen with the newer G2 model.  With it, one presses a button, the bottom opens and the waste dumps out.<br /><br />And another thing the original, old model does is that it can easily flip itself over when vacuuming dumping the contents all over the floor that you just vacuumed up!  This flipping does not happen with the newer G2 model either.<br /><br />Swivel Sweepers are handy for quick vacuuming, nothing heavy duty.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I'm so addicted to the game. I get all excited when an update comes out lol like a kid...I have both so I have more puzzles
0062202081|5.0|Before calling me a 10 year old girl, I will let you know I am a male in my twenties. Not sure why I decided to read this book. I was always a fan of his but not \\"hardcore\\" like some people. Judging this book based on content and not literary ability, it was excellent. DONT read this if you are expecting some kind of literary Shakespearean masterpiece. Don't forget, Justin is 18 years old and is a SINGER, not a seasoned writer. That being said, this is an easy read. I read it in one day over the span of a few hours.  What I liked about this book was that it had a fair amount of information that wasn't included in the documentary Never Say Never or his first book.  There were some appropriately placed pictures throughout the book; many of which I've also never seen before.  You can tell that what Justin says in this book is truly coming from him and from the heart. It is almost as if Justin is standing in front of you telling you the story.  It is very personal at parts but never becomes boring or repetitive. He talked about each topic with an appropriate amount of detail.  Parts of this book are funny, some are sad, and some are purely factual/storytelling. What I enjoyed reading about in particular was his conversation with Kobe Bryant. If you haven't heard about that, I'm not going to give it away; I assure you it was an amazing moment in the book and sounds like it was an amazing moment in Justin's life.  If you are on the fence about reading this book, I will tell you this. Even if you are not a fan of Justin or if you are his biggest fan...this book WILL make you gain respect for him.  Even if you arent a huge fan of his music, you will see how incredible of a human being Justin is. I use the words \\"incredible\\" and \\"human\\" for a reason. He is incredible because of his talent, love for family/friends/fans, ability to keep calm in front of thousands, contributions to charity,  and a lot more....but what I liked reading about was the human side.  They say you don't know or love somebody until you know all their faults; I think that is applicable in this situation.  We already know why Justin is one of the most famous artists of all time,  but until you learn about him in this book,  you cant truly appreciate the whole story.  Yes,  Justin cries. Yes,  Justin has rgrets. Yes,  Justin makes mistakes ....but if he was perfect,  we wouldn't appreciate him in the same way. He is not a \\"machine.\\" He is not a \\"product.\\" He is Justin Bieber and if you don't know the full story behind him,  you need to read this.  The last thing I will touch on is the title...could not be more appropriate. Here is my favorite quote from the book, said by Justin.....\\"There's no point in doing something if you're not going to strive to be the best. My best is still far away-- I've got more striving to do... ha, ha!\\"  I'll leave you with that. I guarantee this book will put a smile on your face...fan or not.  There are topics in here that are relatable for many people.  I guarantee you will appreciate this. If you don't., I will invite you to my house to hit me with a baseball bat; one of those blow up ones from a carnival,  not a real one,  because that would hurt....<br />if you have any questions,  tweet me! @justiferrt know or love somebody until you know all their faults; I think that is applicable in this situation.

1609611543|2.0|I bought this book after watching Bill O'rielly  show. I thought it would help me to reduce my cholesterol.  I think this book is bogus. I lowered my cholesterol using a plant based diet, I took my cholesterol from 210 to 127 and my LDL from 143 to 64 on a plant based diet. This book also said that wheat causes a your vldl to convert in to the small dense pattern B particle of LDL. My plant based diet has made my particles pattern A the large boyant particle, and I eat a ton of wheat products from cereal to whole wheat bread. From the studying Ive been doing, niacin is the only thing that make your small dense pattern B particles change into large boyant pattern A particles. By the way, I'm 50 years old and have lost 25 lbs and lowered my cholesterol following a plant based diet. I have followed the Pritikin diet for years. Ornish and Esselstyn have just done the studies that validate what Pritikin has said for years. If you read the Atkins diet, you'll find a lot of similarities to the Wheat belly diet. The worst diet ever!!!
0385344333|5.0|You gotta love their determination. I'm shocked at their obvious tactic at hitting the non helpful button after SOOOO many Reacher books. I only found out about him 3 years ago and have read every single one since then. And I'm middle aged and have reading this stuff for 30 years. Of course it's unreal and gets a bit repetitive. Isn't that what we love about this guy? I can go toe to toe with any literary snob out here. It's mindless fluff and I love him to the nth degree. My internal clock says it took 2.5 minutes to write this review.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Brilliant read, just cant wait until new book comes out.  Could not put book down and read when ever I could.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Rarely doo I find an app that does exactly what it's supposed to do and do it well, but this is an exception.  it works great all the time.
B008XG1X18|4.0|overall this app gives you everything you get on the regular website. the downside is that it force closes quite a bit. fix that and then ill give you 5 stars
B00003CY0V|1.0|Arriving at the tail end of Hollywood's naive fascination with the imaginary lifestyle of glamorous hackers, this is an utterly ludicrous daydream without even the hint of a connection to reality. It's loaded with stars - Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and John Travolta (of all people) take the leads, with supporting shots from Don Cheadle and Vinnie Jones - but abysmally acted and thoroughly stiff, narrow and postured. The plot stabs in all directions without hitting anything substantial, more wrapped up in looking cool than going anywhere, and has its priorities so far out of whack that it actually expects the audience to deify the same character that's shown casually slaughtering dozens of innocents in the very first scene. As vapid, cheesy, overindulgent mind-numbers go, it's a real jewel.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have only had this App for a month and I have fallen in love with it! I would definently say to buy it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i think its good for lists or checklists; i love all the little tools inside the app. very good apps
0385523912|5.0|I loved this book. It took me beyond the word \\"famine\\" and let me understand what it meant to pick through grass for edible weeds, what it is like to watch a husband and son die from lack of food, what it is like to live with the knowledge that your family members who didn't defect with you went to prison camps and likely died there. This one is a heartbreaker. Thank you to the author who delivered this important story to the world.
1844486524|4.0|This is a great book for beginners & intermediate students to learn to how braid, etc.  It gives simple instructions with LOTS of pictures.  Also has many ideas for gifts, etc.  :o)

B003Y5H574|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that made me laugh and cry and then laugh some more. Having gone through similar events in my life made it all the better. One thing you get by the end is that all love makes you both crazy and stupid. You won't be disappointed seeing this one. Maybe a bit of a chick flick but believe it or not my husband loved it every bit as much as I did.
B008CJ0KI8|1.0|huge waste of money! highly over rated! there was not one song that captured me. it is very sad to see what music has come to

B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app and fun way to browse Pinterest. However it regularly doesn't want to load and you have to Force Close.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Great book, quick read, but a little over hyped in my opinion. The change in writing styles is impressive, but sometimes overwrought. And I felt the ending was a little desus ex machina.<br />But these are minor quibbles. It was absolutely worth reading.
0385344333|1.0|Wow. OK, it had to happen, after what 17 shots at being perhaps the most consistently readable fiction writer out there, Tom Cruise movie and all, Child sort of lost his muse on this one. What to compare it to? The Reacher story that took place in the dead of winter, where you could hear the snow crunch with each footprint, that was one of the best, and totally escapist. This one, not so much. The joy, the thrill, of Reacher is that the reader USUALLY MALE gets to play along and figure things, sort of an interactive book. But that only works when things keep moving. Sorry for the spoiler but halfway through Reacher ends up in some sort of holding compound and except for maybe the very last 20 pages of the book (which is busy busy busy) the novel just sort of derails into a lot of talk, and a lot of details, many of which don't make sense. Not engaging. The worst yet
B004LQI0HE|4.0|Unique and heartbreaking beautiful film. Wonderful, subtle acting from a very talented cast. This movie stayed with me for a long time after I watched it.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game as much as wmw, which I have tri-ducked on all lvls. My only problem is I have beaten the game and now waiting on more new lvls.  Bring out new lvls soon please.

B004GJDQT8|5.0|UPDATE: They have fixed it for Nexus 7 and made it actually look awesome.<br />You can see my previous review below. But they did make it work better. If i didn't look at my review list I probably would have not updated it to 5 stars.<br /><br />Good job on improving Amazon.<br /><br />08/12:What happened? I could use it before and now I cannot use it on my device. Everything worked just fine. Thanks a lot amazon for ruining my shopping experience. Don't expect me to buy from you anything as often as I used to due to inability to work on the Nexus 7.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|the movie is espectacular. great show, even if it hasn't content, or story, or magnamimus performances; still being great for all family.this movie is not a paradigm, like the matrix, the ten comandaments or Forrest Gump, or even the last batman .but is a huge action show... like when you see fireworks(fun for your eyes, not your brain, so to speak )<br /><br />But what is annoying; is that the ilegal copys are allready on the internet, I know people that already saw it in hd blueray quality. and I preorder it , since it was available (june), and need to wait until september 25 to see it in blueray. why did they take soo long? for bring out  the blueray or dv edition; that's unfair... how do disney-marvel is waiting  for our loyalty, to the original combo or the other editions if they treat us like this.<br /><br />the stars I removed were for the time they keep me waiting(Disney-marvel)... not because is a bad movie,  as I already say is espectacular.  but the product will came out too late(I'm rating the product not the movie itself)
B000MKXEME|5.0|This movie is simply put one of the greatest horror films ever made, it has everything mad scientists, zombie like people, gore and more. It is very original. Jeffery Combs is fanastic as Herb West.They don't get much better than this.
0525953728|3.0|The author said he was inspired to be a SEAL after reading a book about special ops when he was in middle school.  He states that he hopes that this book might inspire another middle school student.  This book is riddled with profanity.  Since I appreciate the historical significance of the story, appreciate the reason for writing the book, and think my middle school son will be interested in reading I read the book with a black pen in order to censor the language.  It was significant.  Not for a middle school student.<br /><br />On another note.  The author grew up in Alaska, son of missionaries.  He speaks of their faith; not of his own.  And how he was so \\"lucky\\" many times.  God bless his faithful parents who had prayed for him throughout his career.  Fellow Christian parents of adult children understand.
B0086QS7N2|3.0|When I heard the heavy, grinding sound of BU2B for the first time in 2010, then in concert in Pittsburgh and Cleveland, I could only imagine what this album would sound like. I waited for 2 years for this album to come out, and now that it has, all I can say is that I'm disappointed for three reasons.<br /><br />1. As others have stated, the layers upon layers of sound don't hold a candle to the straight forward recordings of their work from the 70's. Even when listening to Bad Boy from their 1974 bootleg at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, a.k.a., Fifth Order of Angels -- I'd trade BU2B for the raw, live sound of that recording of Bad Boy any day.<br /><br />2. Compare Cygnus X-1 Book II to Carnies, The Pass to The Garden, Natural Science to Seven Cities of Gold, or even Xanadu to Caravan. Compare *any* song from the 70's or even as late as the 90's and you realize that there is no comparison when it comes to what Rush was and has become.<br /><br />3. Much of the album has elements from previously recorded material. Same chord progressions, same rhythm fills, same sound. Don't believe me? Listen to 3:12 to 3:20 of Clockwork Angels, then listen to 19:06 19:47 of 2112 and compare the two.<br /><br />I'm the biggest Rush fan in State College, but I have to say that I'm overall disappointed with Rush's most recent effort. After 40 years of music, one would think that they would move forward, not backward while cherry-picking from their best efforts. At least Neil tried to reinvent himself in the months prior to Test For Echo. If they're out of fresh ideas and new sound, I would suggest that there's nothing wrong with listening to other progressive giants like Opeth or Porcupine Tree.<br /><br />In the end, I refuse to jump on the \\"Clockwork Angels is the greatest album of the year\\" bandwagon just because it's a Rush album. After 20 years of listening to the greatest band on earth, I expect more.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is awesome! A must read for ppl that like mythical creatures, action, drama and fun. I think Cassandra Claire does an excellent job at building her charactors and stories in a way that leave the reader wanting more. I have bought all of her books and can't get enough. These books have been compaired to The Twilight Saga. They're similer, but deffinantly NOT the same in any way. There are more creature types and not really the \\"love story\\" that you would expect from a Twilight like book. Cassandra Claire's books have me reading more than I have read since I had my daughter almost a year ago. I highly recommend her books to anyone who wants a good book to read that you can wrap yourself into.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so glad android finally came out with this app! I am on this app constantly. There is so much great stuff on this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has all the essentials. some of the games remind me of old school games from the arcade. rock on.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Love this product. The only thing I don't like is that my BOSE speakers stay on constantly if I do not turn them off. They used to turn off by themselves after 15 minutes or so of no use but I guess since the box stays on it is always sending something so the speakers so they stay on and I have to manually turn them off. Not a big deal. Some reviews said they had problems with interference, but there is absolutely none. Sounds just as good as when I hooked it up directly to my old TV. No complaints.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a great book for adventure and action. The main character is Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl who can hunt and has to provide for her own family. She has a little sister named Prim, she is young,small and gentle. Katnisses best friend is Gale he is also her hunting partner and someone she can talk to. At the reaping for the hunger games Prim gets chosen and Katniss immediately volunteers herself for the hunger games. The hunger games are a fight to the death and the other tribute that gets chosen for the hunger games is a boy named Peeta Mellark his parents own the bakery in district 12. Their mentors' name is Haymitch Abernathy he is an alcoholic old man, yet he is one of the two people to win and still alive. In the Hunger Games many things happen and many die.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app crashes every time I open it!!! And every time I try to play a video it says my connection quality is poor! My Internet is just fine!! This is by FAR the WORST youtube app I've eve used!! This app is crap.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire. The only problem is that it's a battery hog. Usually when I download a video, Ill close the app and watch it using the gallery app. Other than that it works just fine.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was sent this book by email as a book I might like because I like thrillers, it suggested it was a thriller I should have read the write up more because I would never have bought such dribble, I would have had more thrills with a lemon.  This book is not a thriller although I did come close to wanting to kill of all of the characters. This book is a sad reflection on publishers printing a book to gain money. This writer needs to go to writing school and learn some basic skills on writting an interesting story line.  I also think that years ago I read about the house and the meadow with Man Child and Wife in something else.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie was perfect. Amazon made it simple to watch the movie instantly. I plan on buying more movies on amazon to watch instantly.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|Like the other reviewers, this is a great companion to BMR.  It has a different vibe, more bluesy/rocking \\"Little Lizzy Mae\\" and less psychedelia and deep lyrics. That 13-minute jam, \\"Vibration & Light Suite\\" is simply amazing stuff.  I love the ramake of \\"Appaloosa\\" too.  Maybe this should have been first set, but either way buy both new CRB cds.  The Cassal solos are tight ( a la Garcia) and the synth/moog keys are way trippy.  I saw them live recently and they mixed old and new CRB , as well as some New Earth Mud stuff - also some cool covers.  Can't wait to see 'em again live in 2 weeks.

He's helped me overcome my own loneliness by sharing the pains of being alone.<br /><br />So whenever you feel lonely, sad, or dejected, pop in Nick Drake and he'll make you feel better!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator was just what I was looking for.  It performs all the functions I needed it for.  I love how it uses the whole screen.
B006T3RM08|2.0|...Which is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Sleek looking and packaged as beautifully as a real Apple product. The idea is great and I was So looking forward to using it. BUT.. just like many of the reviews state, the compartments that hold the keyboard and the trackpad are too tight. Once I was able to get the peripherals in, the pressure kept pushing the side buttons and turning the devices off!! I tried and tried, cause I really liked the idea of the piece. Since it is just plastic, I was wary of \\"stretching \\" it too much for fear that it would break. Called Amazon and, Amazon, as usual, came through again, giving me absolutely no grief about returning it at their expense for a full refund. I went ahead and ordered the \\"MeshWe Bluefin Seamlessly Connects Magic Trackpad to Apple Wireless Keyboard\\" mentioned in some of the other reviews. It's a few bucks more, but hopefully worth it. I'll update this review when I receive the other brand as replacement.
B0009VSB06|4.0|Can be a little touchy at first til you get use to the sensitivity of each setting..<br />Found quarters under 6\\" of soil and grass.. Don't waste time and money on cheaper models.. This is a good one to start with..
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is the greatest movie of all time. Everything about it is perfect. Heath Ledger's Joker was the most rememberable performance of All Time. Christian Bale is the greatest Batman of All Time. Christopher Nolan is the greatest director of the Modern Era. The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest story for a series of All Time for any series, film, tv, game, book, etc. The Perfect Beginning, Second Act, and Finale. I love this movie, this series, and Batman. It's a must see!<br /><br /> 25/5  Yeah that's right, 25 out of 5!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This film was done well, with some interesting characters, but let's be honest--the Queen (Theron) was the fairest in the land. It is clear the diretor was heavily influence by Peter Jackson. Just look at the Prince (with a bow and arrow) and the Huntsman (with an ax) busting into a room together--that just rings with a parody of Gimli and Lagalos. I would also be remiss not to mention the arial shot of the group of men and dwarves traveling along the mountain's spine also reminded me of scenes from the LOTR. That said, I still liked this film.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|An excellent app that does what it says - downloads YouTube videos to your device. NOTE: the Amazon app store version is not always the most recent.  As I'm writing this, the Amazon version is 1.05.37, and it's no longer working properly - the current version is 1.05.39.  To get the latest version, visit the TubeMate web site, listed at the top of the screen when you open the app.<br /><br />The app works like an overlay of the YouTube web site. You can login to your YouTube account as usual to access your playlists and feeds. From any video page, you can click the green arrow at the bottom to either watch the video as normal, or download it to your device in any available quality/size.<br /><br />One nice feature about this app is that it can continue playing sound when you turn off your phone's screen (at least it can on a Samsung Galaxy S3, Ice Cream Sandwich). I often watch/listen to instructional or guided relaxation videos on YouTube and sometimes I turn the screen off to save battery. The old YouTube app on my SGS2 could do this, but the latest YouTube versions can't. To me that's a very useful option.<br /><br />Like many free apps, TubeMate is ad-supported. A banner ad will appear at the top or bottom. I've personally never seen a porn ad like another reviewer complained about.  Maybe I've seen a dating-service ad, I can't really remember - nothing too scandalous.
B0030T1NAO|1.0|This will be the second time I will return this item.  All three DVDs were blank.  Nothing on the disc.  I will not order this item again.

B008E374PO|5.0|The Midsummer Station is such a FANTASTIC Marvel. The cover artwork is so creative and beautiful - just like all of Owl City's albums. The style is different from Adam's previous albums, but still just as enjoyable! I HIGHLY recommend this CD! Every song is different and so awesome. Buy this CD and all of Owl City's albums - You won't be disappointed. I can't wait for his next album to come out! OWL CITY rocks!!!! BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!! :)
B000071ZZI|5.0|Fishermen in a boat traveling on the Mediterranean, during a heavy rain storm, find a man floating in the ocean with a flashing light on him.  They rescue him and bring him aboard only to find that he is alive but unconscious.  He has been shot twice in the back and one of the ship's crew removes the bullets from his back.  He also finds along scar on the man's back and he removes a tubular implant from him. It is a laser projector that when activated shows a Swiss bank account number and bank name onto the wall of the ship.<br /><br />When the man suddenly awakes he does not know where he is or how he arrived there.  He has amnesia.  The man helps on the fishing boat crew while they are at sea.  He is always talking to himself in foreign languages and asking who he is.  He tries to remember who he is but he is without an identity.  When the boat arrives at the port the captain gives him a small amount of money to get to the bank in Switzerland.  He takes the train but he does not have enough for a room so he sleeps on the street on a park bench.  Two policemen roust him up and the man suddenly begins speaking fluent Swiss.  He then quickly knocks out and disarms the two policemen in seconds.  He is a master of martial arts and he did not even know that he could do that.<br /><br />He goes to the Bank and opens a safe deposit box that is full of passports, money in many currencies and a gun.  He assumes the name of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) which is from one of the passports....<br /><br />This is a high action thriller involving an undercover operative in a secret department of the CIA.  He failed his mission and now they want him dead, immediately.  The film is a fast moving spy thriller and Matt Damon does a great job in playing the role he is in.  It provides a view into the operations of the CIA and perhaps a real insight into the world of undercover agents.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and it is a first class suspense thriller.  I recommend it to you!
B008MEM24S|5.0|love this game I just can't stop playing and come on how can you not love Perry he is so darn cute.

B007IX383I|5.0|Everything Anathema does is amazing. They transcend themselves and the music industry every time they walk into a studio and walk out with a new masterpiece. This is why they are my favorite band out there right now, and have been consistently since I began listening to them 12 years ago. Please never stop making such emotional, meaningful, and expressive music.<br /><br />P.S. What is it going to take to get Anathema to come to the US, I feel left out in the cold here.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can I say  a wonderful love story.  I couldn't put it down.....it is quite sexy and erotic with scenes that leave you breathless
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I have been playing for seven months or so and I haven't had the timer problems that others have had but it seems that the last task I completed was the last task. I'm in level 88 and can still collect and farm and such but the game isn't giving me the other things to do. I don't know if it will again or if the game is pretty much done.
0553801473|5.0|Can't wait for book 6!  I love this series and I am hopeful that George RR Martin continues to produce this quality of fantasy.
B0092MKTL2|3.0|After really enjoying the Continued Silence EP, the tracks not derived from that album generally disappoint here on Night Visions.  The first half of the album definitely shines, but 4 of the 5 tracks were on Continued Silence.  Tip Toe is a new track that is definitely enjoyable with an interesting new take on 80s retro pop mixed in with some interesting lyrics.<br /><br />Most of the \\"newer songs\\" are on the second half of the album, and unfortunately, that's when the album severely loses steam and never fully recovers. While the band strives for the same diverse sounds of catchy alternative rock mixed with synthesizers and occasional electronic beats, there is a somewhat hollow feeling that permeates and it starts with the music.  Alex Da Kid co-wrote and produced most of the Continued Silence EP, but his only new contribution here is on the track \\"Bleeding Out.\\"  While \\"Amsterdam\\" shows the band's range and the lyrics aren't bad, the lack of interesting layering and the ultimate message of despair in the song start the album into a descent. \\"Hear Me\\" is a fairly standard rock song with lyrics that again put the song's character in a sense of despair while trying to lean on his loved one.  \\"Every Night\\" doesn't really display anything interesting musically and once again has the character in a state of self-loathing with the refuge of a loved one being his only hope for existence.  I couldn't help but feel that Hear Me and Every Night sounded like B-side versions of \\"Round and Round\\" and \\"My Fault.\\"  The collaboration with Alex Da Kid on Bleeding Out starts to pick up the album with great layering and better lyrics (even though the singer still hates himself).  \\"Under Dog\\" is upbeat but musically has a really basic and somewhat bland arrangement.  He sings about a tendency to view his life below his expectations but doesn't really explain why, making this an upbeat song about despair with basic lyrics.  \\"Nothing Left to Say\\" has interesting music and a nice dramatic arrangement, but the lyrics represent very basic depictions of hating life and giving up.  I don't necessarily mind the despair in songs, but it should at least tell an interesting story. \\"Rocks\\" is placed within the same track as Nothing Left to Say.  At only 2 minutes long, it may have been included on the album as a pseudo-hidden track because it's a very upbeat song and the band didn't likely want to end the album with the trail of its latter songs.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad album, but there wasn't much that grabbed me after the Continued Silence songs. While the band doesn't need Alex Da Kid on every song (e.g., It's Time and Tip Toe), his presence definitely brings the band to its height.  Lyrically, the singer clearly expresses his despair through religious concepts (e.g., sin, guilt, shame, heaven, hell) but has a difficult time reflecting his feelings in a non-literal way.  It's likely that the bonus track \\"Fallen\\" didn't make it on the regular album because the singer talks about \\"falling\\" or \\"being fallen\\" so often.  (He seems to believe in the concept that we are all born as sinful fallen creatures.)  It's too bad that Fallen, \\"Working Man\\", and \\"Cha-Ching\\" were not on Night Visions instead of the less stellar songs.  The three bonus songs not included here remind me much more of the satisfying feel and sound of Continued Silence.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love Pinterest and now I am glad I have it on my Kindle!<br />Makes my DIY lifestyle so much easier!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really pretty good. I like all the variety of the games there is on this application. the biggest thing is on some of the games they do not have enough explanation.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|Another awesome album from the boys! Their ability to play \\"MY\\" music for \\"ME\\" has existed since their very 1st album.
B008Y5OWMK|4.0|As an ardent fan of quality widescreen epic fare, I built a giant screen home theater in order to do justice to so many films that can seldom, if ever be seen in the sort of presentation for which they were expressly made.  I am thrilled to learn that Criterion has stepped up to the task of restoring Michael Cimino's \\"Heaven's Gate\\".  The DVD edition, which has, sadly, been the best version available, is a slap-dash affair.  It is not even anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs, and it has disappointing video and audio shortcomings throughout its considerable length.  Even with all of these problems, I have presented screenings for many friends over the past few years, and despite the many terrible reviews the film has received, all of the viewers in my facility found it an immensely worthwhile show.  If you are the kind of movie fan who grows impatient when the story does not unfold at a consistently fast pace, you should probably forget about this one.  On the other hand, if you favor films that are deeply thought-provoking and visually magnificent, you may agree with me that this one comes very close to being a masterpiece.  It's flaws include a soundtrack that buries too much of the dialogue in a flood of background noise and music.  (One might hope that the new Blu Ray restoration will clean up some of that problem.)  It also suffers from a final action sequence that is over-long and confusing, which can not help but hurt a production of this length.  Repeatedly, Cimino slows the pace of the plot by immersing you in sequences like a wild carriage ride and dancing and partying scenes, clearly designed to give you a feeling of being immersed in the life of the characters, their community, and their era.  I revel in such splendors; I'm sure some would differ with me about this.  A reviewer once said that, if David Lean had made a western, it might have been a lot like this one.  With the film's mature presentation of social problems that have clearly afflictedour country from early in its history to the present day, it is one of the most unusual grand-scale epics ever made.  I eagerly look forward to discovering what the folks at Criterion have accomplished with the remastering of some of the most magnificent cinematography ever accomplished.  Their DVD of \\"Spartacus\\" was so fine that it looks decidedly better than the subsequent Universal Blu Ray release.  P.S.: Having just viewed Criterion's restoration, I should note that it is now clear that, with all of its other strengths, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" can now be appreciated as nothing less than one of the most beautifully photographed films you'll ever see.  Furthermore, dialogue audibility issues that plagued the original film have been largely eliminated in the grand new Blu Ray edition.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Battery HD shows you where your energy is being used.  It also managed to show me a piece of mal ware that was causing several issues - namely, that it was eating my power faster than the screen and talk time combined!  This little app has been great, and my daughter loves that I can change the battery color!
B0070NSPCU|3.0|Raven's Shadow is an original story. I found the beginning a bit confusing but stuck with it and the story picked up and took off.<br />Great depth of characters, detailed adventures and an engaging story kept me reading, almost to the end. I kind of lost interest at about 75% and decided to read a few other books, then came back and finished this one. I like reading long stories, I loved Mists of Avalon, 11/23/63, but for some reason this one didn't hold my interest all the way through.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't expect anything when I start reading this series. I thought that this will just be a good read between works or when I'm on a train. Many of my friends read the series before so I became interested. But, it's just a usual interest and I'm a little bit skeptical because someone said in the internet that this will be like how Japanese' Battle Royale meets Twilight. But after reading this, I can say, it's not.<br /><br />The way Suzanne Collins has written in the main character point of view really made me absorbed to the story because I get to know the mental struggle of the character. Collins has being true with the emotions of a teenage girl in terms of despair and love. The characters are all lovable. The first book started with a bang, the second is great bridge and the third book is so intense I cannot put down and eventhough I have to stop once in a while gasping for air since I forget to breathe or sorting out my emotion since I got too attached, I finished the book, less than a day, tired but with a smile of satisfaction in my face.<br /><br />Personally, this is a genre that I love. Adventure/action as the main theme with just the right amount of drama.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|This album is the best of Zac Brown.  So many good songs all in one place.  Well worth the money!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this movie after seeeing Facing the Giants also by Alex Kendrick. I was in awe of the talent of these individuals, and absolutely grateful for the story line!!  I have NEVER lost my faith, but different events in my life, like losing the love of my life to death, other family friends to death and suicide, and tragedies within the family I've questioned \\"why bad things happen to good people\\". I wish I could personally thank The Kendrick Brothers for helping me get \\"MOTIVATED\\" to get out the house for more than work, and start living with more energy and a life God could be proud of.<br /><br />This movie touch every emotion, you don't have to have gone through losing a child for example to gain knowledge of compassion and experience what life is all about!!!  Thank you, I have all your movies and will share them with my family and nieces and nephews when appropiate. I'm inspired!!

0857520644|5.0|I read this book because I caught a snippet of Rachel Joyce talking about it on the Diane Rehm Show on  NPR, and it intrigued me. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and by the third chapter, I could not put it down. This book is for readers who are thoughtful, enjoy well-written prose and a story with English countryside as its backdrop. Full disclosure - I am English myself- and I think there are definitely references and elements in the story that non-English would not understand. However, the book centres on what it means to be human, with all its zeniths and nadirs. Through his journey, Harold learns what life is really all about, and that you can like people who are very different from oneself if you just talk to them. I think this novel will become a classic.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this is the app I was looking for all along. Buy it I would think its the best app ever created. Thank you disney
B008XG1X18|4.0|good kindle app esp when I need access on the go. crashes sometimes but easy to open again. worth the price.
B000IFQLBE|4.0|Agree with most of the reviews here - John gives a solid but not great performance here.  Song selection is good (and can't help but realize how many awesome songs John has written over the years) but everything seems a bit rushed and \\"generic\\".

B0087HT36U|4.0|entertaining game. passes the time when you have a few minutes to kill. works great on my kindle fire. did the first 20 or so levels and none were very hard.  still not bad.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Harkens back to the old PC games.  Enjoyed it.  At times felt like I didn't know my next move and did resort to a walkthru.  Some puzzles were difficult as you didn't know if you were working off some previously seen clue or just brute forcing the solution.  Would recommend and hope they develop more pure adventure (no hidden objects - Yay!!) games like this fir the KF.  Had a few freezes bust just hit Menu and then Continue Game and was fine.  Didn't have to even leave the game screens.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like the cute little mini games:) I could play this game all day or at least until ive unlocked all the little mini games and beaten them.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a pretty addictive time killer, but I wish (1) the banner that comes up on finishing a square would not cover the square or that it could be hidden in order to view the completed square without obstruction, (2) hints were an option, (3) there were an ad-free version, and (3), most importantly, it would be landscape friendly, especially for tablet.

B008X77K8W|5.0|Another Chris Knight CD!!  I didn't even know a new one was coming out and when I was just now browsing the MP3 store on my phone, I saw this and thought, can it be??  I have all his CDs and each one is just as heartfelt.  Love all his music and I immediately bought this one without even listening to it.  I really have to like an artist to do that.  Yay!  Now I'll have some new music to listen to at work tonight!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/18/12  Ok, so I've listened to this album about five times since I bought it and I have a few stand-out favorites:<br /><br />Hard Edges is like Hard Candy and I think it could be a good part 2 sort of follow up song, but it's equally good all by itself.<br />Missing You - well, that's just powerful stuff - listen to this when you're really missing someone who never cared as much for you and you'll understand.<br />In The Meantime - makes me think of House and 90 Acres with it's hard scrabble lyrics about just getting by and holding to your principles even if it means losing everything.<br />Nothing on Me - says, plain and simple, you don't know what I've been through to keep on keepin' on.<br /><br />All I can is say is that this man must've done some livin' to write music like this.  Nothing about his music is contrived or scripted, at least IMHO.  I hope he keeps true to his style.  Sure would be a disappointment to see this kind of originality go down the crapper.
B008XG1X18|4.0|my only issue is that I have to open it twice.<br />once to open only to force close it Bc it freezes<br />a second time to actually get to use it.<br /><br />its on my kindle fire.

B008Y1RTUG|5.0|*spoilers*<br />Snow White has never been one of my favorites in the fairy tale realm. Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel were always more my cup of tea. But this re-telling was captivating. Charlize Theron stole the show as the wicked queen, twisting evil with a smattering of sorrow/sympathy that never quite won me over to Snow White's view of things. What I mean is, I never quite fell 100% to the side of wishing the Queen would redeem herself. Of course, that isn't how the story goes anyway, right?<br /><br />I was disappointed when it was the Huntsman's kiss that woke Snow White rather than William finally gathering up the courage to confess his love and bring her back from death's brink. However, I did enjoy the fact that it was not a typical \\"love triangle\\" (yawn) between Snow, William, and the Huntsman but more of a jaded man with life experience impressing upon the younger man to go for his dreams. Even the reviving kiss wasn't really a kiss of LOVE as in the fairy tale by Disney but more of a selfless love of a knight for his queen. \\"Courtly Love\\", I believe they call it. Throw in the fact that she never was told who woke her, and it left the tired \\"love triangle\\" out of the mix.<br /><br />Gone, also, was the typical \\"the man gets the girl\\" ending. The jury is still out on how I feel about that....<br /><br />It is about time for fantasy and fairy tale to be taken seriously in the movie realm of things, and I wonder how much we have Peter Jackson (LoTR, King Kong, The Hobbit) to thank for that? This is definitely on my buy list.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest! It's a little slower loading on my kindle fire compared to my laptop but I could still sit on it for hours.
B005LB1MY6|3.0|I dont hate it but at the same time i dont love it. There are a few good tracks on this album like \\"horsepower\\",\\"civilization\\", \\"canon\\" & \\"helix\\" but the rest fall short of what most of us would expect from these guys. We all know these guy can come up with some pretty tasty disco infused electro rock. It kinda seems like these guys were trying to sound too much like daft punk and queen put together. Doesnt really work . In the future i hope these guys get back to what they do best. Maybe get some collabs going. Kavinsky maybe? Maybe even let one of the Daft punks get behind the boards and work their tasty magic. It worked on sebastien telliers album. I expect these guys to step it up next time. So if youre thinking about snagging this album I'd say only do it if you can get it for cheap. There are some tracks worth keeping.

1932907009|2.0|I almost never write a review, but this book is so poor that I felt the need to warn you. The \\"writer\\" drops many names, but there are no examples of a screenplay. None at all. And the advice given is no more than what a first year English major will learn.

B0087HT36U|2.0|You have to be connected to the Internet in order for the game to launch. This is true with most games that require WAN connection.<br />I don't approve of games with in app purchases, especially when you have to buy virtual items for real money.

B0098VYKSA|3.0|I've seen better, I've seen worse.  I skipped all of the Twilight stuff, so this was the first time I'd seen Kristen Stewart act.  Like so many others have said, serious lack of talent there.  Dead eyes, she looked stoned through the entire movie.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was good or great.  The movie had a lot of potential, and it might have been great with a different actress playing Snow White.

1609611543|2.0|William Davis might be right, but he didn't convince me.  His theories about wheat are largely consistent with the idea (championed by Gary Taubes and Robert Lustig, among others) that carbohydrates in general are harmful.  So perhaps it's not wheat per se that is the problem; it's the high carbohydrate content of wheat products that's the issue.<br /><br />Another problem with this book is that it's very wordy and repetitive.  I got the sense that Davis had to struggle to write enough content to fill a book.  I remember one section of the book where he tediously listed many, many examples of wheat-based products that you can find in the supermarket.  He went on ad nauseum.  Was that really necessary?<br /><br />My recommendation is to skip the book and wait to see how this all plays out.  Perhaps Davis will be proved right, or perhaps he's conflating wheat with carbs.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|LOVE this book.  What an amazing life experience to share.  Thank you Marcus for sharing your story and for all you do for this country!!  I don't know how anyone can NOT support these troops.  A true MUST READ!!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I heartily endorse this wonderful film, which I rank with \\"Dragonslayer\\", \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"Excalibur\\" as among the finest exemplars of the fantasy film genre.  Art direction, costumes, cinematography, screenplay, performances: all work in harmonious concert to construct a consistent world with roots that delve deep into the wellsprings of myth.  Jung and Campbell would be pleased.  The director, especially, is to be commended for \\"sticking to his guns\\" by keeping the tone and quality of the film's look and action squarely within the world he's created. No anachronistically modern sensibility here; no winking at the audience; and no cheap laughs. In fact, the film plays more like a highly coherent dream than a typical escapist Hollywood summer movie. I have nothing against empty-headed action flics; but if you're in the mood for something more ambitious, try \\"Snow White and the Huntsman.\\"

B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is worlds better than trying to pin through the web on my kindle fire!  I just wish there was a &quot;pin it&quot; option as well.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I formerly rated this game at one star because I kept losing packs that I paid money for and could not get them back. I loved the pictures because I could email them to myself and I used them to make beautiful screensavers. Then an update left the final picture looking like a puzzle, so I couldn't use them anymore. I deleted the app.<br />But now ... YEARS LATER! .... I have gotten a new Kindle HD 8 and there have been good updates. All of my paid packs can be re-downloaded and the pictures stay pictures, not puzzles, so I'm happy again.<br />The ONLY drawback is that it gobbles up A LOT of storage. That is what keeps it from being 5 stars.

1451627297|5.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King's work since I was 15, I started with the Talisman (co-written) and then went on to The Stand . . . from there I just couldn't stop. As with the majority of writers, a wonderful novel can't be achieved every time but SK really hit the mark with 11/22/63! What attracts me most to SK's writing is his ability to create complete, 3-dimensional characters and his gift for the Fantasy Genre. This book had both those elements while still managing to incorporate a major part of American History.<br /><br />11/22/63 maintained its excitement throughout the entire ride by combining Fantasy, horror, history and romance. It was a truly compelling read for who hasn't wondered about the possible changes to American History if JFK had never been assassinated?<br /><br />I experienced the whole range of emotions throughout my journey and will add as my last piece of praise the unexpected elements of beauty he was able to capture throughout. His gift for descriptive detail allowed me to experience the beauty of a time I would never had experienced had I not read this book as well as a beauty that few have ever truly experienced . . . the face of true love.<br /><br />All in all, I think this novel is one of his very best! Bravo Mr. King!
0062073192|4.0|The book was not terribly riveting and at times tedious.  However, for those fans of \\"Supernatural\\", it was a good look at John Winchester.  The reader got to know the senior Winchester and what went through his mind regarding his wife, his sons, and the whole demon hunter experience.  Overall, it was a good book.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I pre-ordered this book for my Kindle Fire, and read it in two days.  I am a Lee Child and Jack Reacher fan and have read every book.  This one was slow and the plot seemed a little stretched and odd in places.  Too much riding in cars, not enough action. I felt like Jack was tired and not really giving it his all until the very end.  Almost all the action is at the very end of this book.  I have never been bored with Jack Reacher adventures before, but this one did it!  I certainly won't give up on Jack (or Lee Child), and will be eager to read the next Reacher novel, but sadly, I can't really recommend this one.  Unlike some other reviewers, I just can't believe that Lee Child let someone else write this book.  Every author has hits and misses!  I am hoping that the next Reacher novel will be the best one ever.  I hope all Reacher fans will see the movie Jack Reacher and support a great character, a great author and a great actor.  I don't think this movie would have been produced without Tom Cruise.  Let's give it a chance and maybe we will see some of our other best loved stories about Jack on the big screen!
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Trojan Horse continues the adventures of Jeff Aiken and Daryl Haugen, whom we met in Zero Day. This time they're swept up in the middle of a US/Israel vs. Iran/China vs. United Nations secret cyber battle, and their bravery and considerable wits are required to prevent not only their own deaths, but Iran's emergence as a nuclear power.<br /><br />Russinovich, as before, is able to cast a detailed vision of the malware ecosystem into a gripping and thrilling tale. There's enough suspense to keep you reading, and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.<br /><br />And he gets it right. Since publication just a few weeks ago, the newspapers are already revealing the same kind of intrigue between Iran and China that Russinovich wrote about. Which leads me to this: either Russinovich took a ride on a time machine, or he did a great job at projecting. My bet is on the former: he's clever enough to have invented one, and wise enough to keep it secret from us mere mortals.<br /><br />Bravo, Mark! I'm looking forward to #3.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|I Saw this on opening night which was also on my birthday. So viewing it was extra special since Alien is one of my favorite movies of all time. A Blu-ray release will be a definite must because the cinematography was superb in this movie. The alien world and ship(s) settings are remarkably beautiful and felt real. The acting was top notch with kudos to Michael Fassbender being the most memorable. The beautiful Noomi Rapace and seriousness of Charlize Theron also helped push Prometheus narrative as well. Of course, the hate comments I read after this movie was released make it not perfect, as usual:<br /><br />\\"this is not a direct Alien sequel, but only based in the universe.\\" Duh, we knew this from the beginning, Why is this hump hard to get over, dumb metacritic reviewer?<br />Scientific fact nerds will be nit picky... even though we know it's a sci-fi film. Do we really need to point out every great sci-fi films problems? The movie is set in the future and on out of this world ideas.  Just Go with it!<br />The story was cliched and predictable, even though, wait, why are these guys lost? Okay that doesn't make sense, but oh well.<br /><br />My biggest problem and the only constructive argument that I agreed on was, what exactly does the main plot device actually do? In Alien, the xenomorph monster was easy to understand. In Prometheus, Ridley Scott and writers loaded the black goo monster mechanic into a plot shotgun and shot the effects everywhere making it hard to figure out what exactly is the menace here. So Scott's films of the past, it seems that a need for a director's cut is in need.<br />So with that in mind, this may not be THE copy of Prometheus to own at the time. However, I still liked what I watched and I beleive that of all the movies releases lately with a director's commentary, this may be the one if you are seeking possible answers to questions of the film.. It did suck me back into the Weyland/Utani cooperate future of the Alien universe. That certain setting I love to see where once again, they make things more dangerous for human life than they intended. For a recently released sci-fi film of the past five years, this is still a great theatrical viewing. Not perfect like District 9, but entertaining nonetheless.certain setting I love to see where once again, they make things more dangerous for human life than they intended.

B004A8ZWW4|1.0|I received my DVD on time, but at the end the DVD freezes and it's at the most crucial part of the movie! I checked for scratches and smudges, but there were none, so I am assuming that the DVD is defective. I have contacted the seller, but am waiting for a response to see if they can resolve the issue.
B008602KQI|5.0|You don't have to be a kid to love this movie; my husband and I are over 50 and initially watched this at the movie theater and purchased it as soon as it was available - even pre-ordered it.  We anxiously await the sequel!
B003EVWDR0|3.0|The war-driven plot may be a racy historical metaphor, but that's about as far out on an artistic limb James Cameron is willing to go. Everything else about Avatar; his first movie since Titanic; is safe and sound, often to the point of being clich&eacute;; a fact its surprisingly stodgy dialogue and paper-thin characterization give away right from the beginning.<br /><br />In a future world where Earth people fly to other places in search of mineral goods, a marine named Jake Sully infiltrates moon Pandora; home of a race of tall blue cat-people with long tails and braided hair. He does so with a team of scientists via the Avatar program, which allows them to live on Pandora as Navi creatures without really being there.<br /><br />It's imaginative science fiction and the world of Pandora is a visual wonder. There are strange creatures, big and small, and awe-inspiring landscapes that sort of make you want to visit a place like that in real life. But the story; a mythological fairy tale based around eye-rollingly unnecessary themes of religion and romance; never lives up to the hype.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B001AT4Y84|4.0|The machines aren't the only things rising. The sight of the TX cyborg, played by Kristanna Loken, causes my body to react automatically. Her face, which only occasionally breaks expressionless focus for a slight grin, is perfectly cute. Her body is perfectly slim. It's her conduct that could use some work. Her merciless aggression is a turn-on, yes, but the girl is literally a killing machine. So if she touches you, it's only to take the form of your body when you're dead.<br /><br />The \\"Terminator\\" moniker now refers to her. The T-101 model, played by an Arnold Schwarzenegger who looks older but still fit for the role, is now the savior. He's been sent from the future to protect the lives of John Conner and his future wife from both the TX and the near nuclear holocaust the people of the world will face as a result of the Skynet computer virus. The virus has infiltrated our machines and decided to wipe us out, hence the movie's subtitle.<br /><br />This part 3, which doesn't feature Linda Hamilton and isn't directed by James Cameron, disappointingly enough, is inferior to part 2 but superior (better) than part 1. There are surprisingly funny moments and the overall plot, while riddled with improbable coincidences and stodgy dialogue, is consistently engaging. The best scenes are the fight and shoot ones that revolve around the TX. There's an extended chase involving a crane truck that's actually quite remarkable.<br /><br />marcellee.com
030758836X|4.0|As I read this book, I had a recurring thought. Perhaps I am naïve, but if there are lots of people in the real world  that are like the dysfunctional characters in this book, then the human race is in big trouble. The reader will encounter manipulative, cruel individuals who abuse and are abused with abandon. Brilliant sociopaths, lowlifes who take advantage of others, misfits, completely unhappy and miserable examples of mankind, occupy the pages of this book. I was hard pressed to find one likable, and possibly normal being, who was not intent on using another, not intent on drawing attention to themselves, not intent on seeking fortunes, power and control using any means to justify their ends.<br /><br />As the pages turned I could not believe the developments, and yet, they were just real enough to possibly actually take place. The author captured her characters personality traits perfectly in the dialogue. The narrative twisted and turned and kept the characters and the reader twisting and turning in the wind, as well. What would happen next? Could the situation grow worse? The answer was yes, it kept getting worse and worse until the ending which was a bit of a surprise, but also in the realm of the possible, in the realm of the credible. My tension increased as I continued to read and I was, at times, afraid to find out the conclusion of this mystery. The author makes the unbelievable absolutely believable. These characters were sick people who found each other and fed off each other. They were all some kind of parasite.<br /><br />Gone Girl, just kept surprising me. Nick and Amy, for all appearances, were both very self absorbed, very preoccupied young people, who wanted to appear to be the cool version of a perfect married couple, very much interested in maintaining their independence and not leaning heavily on each other with reproaches. They were \\"the beautiful people\\". However, they were hit hard by the economic downturn, losing their very well paid jobs in New York City. Experiencing these bumps in the road, they were forced to reassess their lives and relocate to Nick's former hometown, where they started  over. Together with his twin sister, and his wife's money, Nick purchased a bar which he operates happily with his sibling.<br /><br />Suddenly, one morning, on their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears in what looks like violent circumstances. After a lengthy investigation, with many shocking revelations, all fingers point to the husband, Nick, who is generally the first and major suspect in cases like these. The storyline will introduce the reader to all sorts of people who thrive on this kind of investigation, not only to help solve the crime, but also for the thrill of it and some for their fifteen minutes of fame, romance or even financial gain. (Nick's wife Amy is the inspiration for \\"Amazing Amy\\", a character in a children's book series created by her parents.)<br /><br />Occasionally, the book got a bit tedious, but just when I was ready to give up, the plot moved on and captured my interest again. The competing, dual narratives and timelines concerning the events Nick and Amy experienced, were engaging, but sometimes it took too long to switch from one of them, to the other. The plot used trompe l'oeill, sleight of hand, and misdirection to provide different clues and constantly pointed me in one and then another direction, as it did the police investigators. It worked so effectively, so perfectly that it kept me involved in the story, eager for more. Each time I  thought I had it all figured out, another theme developed, the plot twisted away, and I was baffled once again.<br /><br />It was really hard to like any of the characters. All of them were self serving, scheming in some way, working under the radar, suffering from one thing or another, often self inflicted wounds because of stupidity, greed, insecurity and perhaps, mental illness.<br /><br />I was able to identify with the closeness of the fraternal twins because I have a twin brother. Also, I was able to identify with the in-law issues, since most of us do experience them in one form or another, but with twins, I suspect it can be more intense because their unusual closeness can cause jealousy. Regardless of any common ground I found within the pages, I could not identify with the issues that troubled any of the characters in the story. They were simply not nice. They lied, stole, cheated, inflicted harm to others, played ugly games with people, disregarded the feelings of others, used them at will and, in general, seemed to be completely corrupt in some way. Yet, haven't we all known someone like that?<br /><br />All in all, Gone Girl, is a really good, exciting read!
B008OUTQ6C|3.0|My love probably isn't big enough for Lianne La Havas. I don't really partake in traditional romance; the kind of \\"love\\" she's referring to here; so most of my affection would be restricted to her pretty doll-like physical appearance. I think I could get swept-up in her music though, to the point where, even if I'm not actually in love with it, my mind would be too hazy, my \\"heart\\" too fluttery, to tell the difference.<br /><br />Some of these songs come close to demonstrating that fact, particularly the two in which she's stripped down to just bluesy vocal melodies and an acoustic guitar. Age and Tease Me are both dedicated to \\"you\\", the guy she's questioning in the title, like every other song. The one that interrupts the flow is the one you can hear a guy's voice replying back on, No Room For Doubt, also one of the album's best.<br /><br />Coming from a new pop artist, the set is something like a breath of fresh air. It's not so hard to create this kind of cozy coffeehouse soundscape. All it really takes are skilled musicians playing live instruments softly as opposed to programming thumpy electronic ones. What makes it stand-out is the arrangement of the vocals on top, something this \\"love\\"-smitten Lianne girl has an apparent knack for.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B007FG9LIE|4.0|In a way I have to agree with some of the statements made in negative reviews but not with their conclusions.  Pines is not fully effective as a crime thriller nor is it fully effective as science fiction.  However, high-toned, intellectual novels don't seem to appeal to me.  What some people may perceive as flaws in the story line are exactly what kept me from putting this down.  Each time the crime thriller aspect of the storyline started to unravel, something disturbingly sci fi was foreshadowed.  I usually read with the intent of falling asleep within an hour but every time I'd start to drift off I'd hit a WTF moment and have to stay up.<br />I'm left kicking myself for having borrowed it instead of buying and may now have to buy the hardcopy to share with my non-Kindle friends.<br />Pines is full of action and suspense and it's just plain fun.<br />If you enjoyed Flowertown, you'll enjoy this.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|I love, absolutely LOVE this movie. I picked this out at the video store on a whim, and DH goes \\"Oh great, another one of your goofy movies.\\" Cause I admit, I kinda like over-the-top bad movies. Or pretty much anything with a zombie in it.<br /><br />Tucker and Dale is not a bad camera work movie.<br /><br />Tucker and Dale is not full of bad acting.<br /><br />Tucker and Dale is not a bad script with crappy jokes.<br /><br />Tucker and Dale is the best \\"bad circumstances\\" movie I have ever seen. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Not a minute of it. It won't be for everyone. If you can't handle blood-guts-and-gore, don't watch it. DO NOT let your kids watch it. But if you have a black sense of humor, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />I liked this movie so much I bought it new. I haven't bought a new movie since \\"Boondock Saints\\". I plan on buying it in Blu-ray as well. It's just that good.

B0032Y8XH8|2.0|I'm not sure I understand all of the hype and awards.  This album is monotonous for me.  Marcus Mumford's vocals are sing songy simple and have this stair step pitch that all sound the same.  As you listen through the tracks you find yourself asking \\"Didn't I already hear this song earlier in the CD?\\".  To make matters worse if you weren't told you might think in some songs you were listening to a bad Dave Mathews cover.  The instrumentals show some quality and talent, but the harmony at times seems to be trying to match pitch with Mumford's voice instead of the other way around.  I struggle to imagine enough diversity of material to pull off another album.

B008Y1RTUG|4.0|Just like other other people have stated in their reviews, you should watch this movie based on the the performance of Charlize Theron alone.  She was amazing as Ravenna, the evil queen.  I was more emotionally invested in her character than anyone else's in the movie.  At the end of the film I was actually hoping that she would triumph over Snow White (the beat down she laid on Kristen Stewart was awesome)!  Watching the dynamics between her and her brother (an excellent performance by Sam Spruell)was worth the price of the rental. I do wish they would have spent more time developing Chris Hemsworth's (the Huntsman) and Sam Claflin's (William) character's.  They did a great job of portraying the torment (Hemsworth for his wife and Claflin for abandoning the Princess), but there just wasn't enough there to evoke more than just passing sympathy. 4 stars for the movie and a purchase of the Blu-ray for my collection.<br /><br />P.S. On Stewart's performance: I will agree that her motivational moment was laughable.  She also didn't come across to me as innocent.  I could have been jaded by the whole infidelity thing and had that filter on while watching the movie, but her body language with the other cast members seemed more \\"sultry\\" than anything else.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I purchased Minecraft after playing 20+ hours of Block Story &amp; like many of you, I wanted to know which is better. I have come to my opinion that they are both worth playing because they are different even though they have similiar play. Block Story let me develop a character that I care a out &amp; have leveled up. monsters have spawn blocks &amp; can be more easily avoided. Death doesn't drop everything like MC. You also have NPCs that give you work for XPs. MC has more to craft but finding resources isn't like the glowing caves of BS. I prefer BS in this way. I understand that MC can sell @ $7 because of the fan base but BS is a fun way to learn the more difficult MC. MC has NO instructions so be prepared to read online help or make mistakes to learn it. I'm prbly in the minority that hasn't spent $20 for the PC or Xbox version so I started with BS. So my recommendation is start with BS and get MC when it goes on sale. You can wait and still have hours of fun with Block Story.

0385344333|1.0|I was so excited about this book and eagerly awaited arrival.  I was thrilled when arrived on my Kindel Fire 45 minutes early.  I am now so disappointed that I spent the time and money to read it.<br /><br />I gave it only one star for the sheer fact that Mr. Child must have suffered so much pain and anguish just to put so many words on paper.  Where the heck was Jack?  Not only did he not seem to have a clear purpose in the story, he was completely AWOL. There was more description in this one book then any two extravagantly  descriptive Barbara Taylor Bradford novels combined.<br /><br />Perhaps if Mr. Child hadn't been so busy reviewing and promoting others works and palling around with Mr. Cruise (who in my opinion will never be anyone's idea of Jack Reacher) he would have had time to write a real Jack Reacher story.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|I respect what Pat and the band tried to accomplish with this recording, but it's not a good<br />sign when, after the sixth or seventh listen, instead of collecting a host of sonic memories that<br />beckon me back to the recording, instead I've collected a list of \\"suggestions\\" for how this recording<br />could have been better executed.<br /><br />I've enjoyed many of Pat's experimental works, including Song X, Orchestrion, Rejoicing, and<br />Quartet. I also enjoy long thematic pieces, such as Beethoven's symphonies. So I had high hopes for<br />\\"The Way Up\\". Upon listening however, I didn't find the theme all that interesting or inspiring. This music<br />to me borders more on filler material than the magnum opus of a great composer/musician. For me, Secret Story<br />represents Pat's magnum opus. The musical landscape of that recording seems so complex, beautiful, stunning, and<br />inspiring. Here, however, those adjectives just don't seem to apply so well.<br /><br />For one, I'm not a big fan of the current PMG lineup/chemistry. Although Antonio Sanchez seems like a technially<br />amazing drummer, I thought Paul Wertico seemed a very creative and capable drummer who seemed to sense very well<br />the percussive requirements of a musical idea. More is not always better. Also, I suppose over the years I've become spoiled by the vocal instrumentation provided by Aznar, Ledford, Blamires, and, most recently, Bona. No offense to Cuong Vu, but<br />I don't consider him in the same league, nor do I believe his trumpet playing is utilized enough.<br /><br />And then there's the collaboration between Metheny and Mays. Do they really still collaborate when not in the recording studio? On this recording I hear more digital keyboard noises and very few memorable piano passages. I question the degree to which Mays felt engaged in the musical and recording process.<br /><br />Finally, in listening it seems that this recording could have had more track listings. Based ontempo and key<br />changes, this piece seemed to have anywhere from 8-12 parts, rather than 4.<br /><br />With all this criticism, I do recommend this<br />recording for the PMG faithful, but someone new to PMG should pass on this and start with some of the earlier recordings, such as Pat Metheny Group, Letter from Home, First Circle, and Still Life Talking. As for a good experimental PMG recording, check out Quartet; which represents a great example of when four brilliant musicians come together to create interesting music in a relaxed \\"keep-it-simple\\" environment. May be that is my underlying problem with \\"The Way Up\\"; in that its overpretentiousness makes me reluctant to move in that direction.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Good product at a good price! I have used this product more than once and find myself to be always satisfied!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews.  I found the book to be engrossing, and had a hard time putting it down over a two day read.<br /><br />I also did not see why it is so controversial, as it is straight forward, positive illumination of our troops going into battle.  I don't see any tactics that are not straight forward, common sense planning. Please read it and decide for yourself, I think you will enjoy the book.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|This movie was done in the 40's with George Sanders playing Bel Ami. Robert Pattinson is great in the role. This one really sticks with the book.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best, and writer/director Gareth Evans took a very simple one and turned it into an unrelenting, pulse-pounding and gleeful exercise in bone-crunching shoot-'em-up kickass action film storytelling with THE RAID: REDEMPTION.<br /><br />The plot of the film is, as I stated, simple. On this particular day in Jakarta, Indonesia, an elite SWAT team is tasked with taking down a dangerous drug lord in the 30-story building that he controls and is populated primarily by that drug lord's thugs and enforcers, and the story and action of this film is told primarily through the eyes of a young rookie to the squad (Iko Uwais, also the film's martial arts choreographer). Once they've arrived, the cops find themselves trapped and under siege by the machine-gun-or-machete-wielding, martial-arts-trained psychopaths that occupy the building.<br /><br />What sets this film apart from most other action films of this variety is the action scenes themselves. There is some fun gunplay to be had early on, but once our surviving protagonists are out of ammo, it's time to get creative with the martial arts. The film's star Uwais is a master of Silat, a martial art that is a little more fluid that Muay Thai but just about as brutal. The setting of the film as well as the mood is very claustrophobic, with most of the fighting taking place in single rooms and corridors and stairwells. The fight choreography is by far the most clever and impressive I've seen in many years, probably since Louis Letterier's UNLEASHED, and Evans allows the action and movement to flow and create its own energy and momentum without using MATRIX-y gravity-defying style or the typical reliance on slow-motion.<br /><br />You know what else is pretty impressive about this film? The actual story and performances! There's some really nice character moments and some really interesting and well-played twisty-turny moments to the film as well.<br /><br />The fight scenes aren't necessarily epic in scope like you might see in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, but the battles are epic in the brutal punishment the opponents dish out to each other. Every fight scene seems like it would be the final fight in a more Hollywood-ized martial arts film, but it's just par for the course for this film.<br /><br />This film is more of a throwback to the late-80's/early-90's era of Hong Kong action cinema with allowing the film to be bloody and brutal, but with a real sense of dark comedy and over-the-top violence that seems very much in line with the combat of films like John Woo's HARD BOILED or THE KILLER.<br /><br />Put simply, THE RAID: REDEMPTION is energetic, visceral and intelligent; certainly one of the finest pure action films in many years and is an absolute joy to watch for fans of action and fans of great filmmaking in general.<br /><br />4.5/5 Starsepic in scope like you might see in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, but the battles are epic in the brutal punishment the opponents dish out to each other.

B00932A2MC|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. It was fun and fast paced. Anyone who has served time in the Navy would absolutely love this film.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|This book made history very interesting. The author's information came from archived letters, so it is not just the opinion of the author. The book follows Henry VIII childhood and covers all six marriages. The book describes each of the wives history and what happens after the marriages.  The book is better than a modern day TV Soap, arranged marriages, affairs,executions, power struggles, religious conflicts and politics from the time period. The book also showed different sides of the characters, for example Henry VIII seems at times like a tyrant, and then a pawn in a political game, with his court trying to deceive him for their own benefits(a deadly game). I also enjoyed the when the author included the cultural and geographical history as well as information on the residences of the King, Queen and Court.

0062183591|3.0|In all honesty, this book was a letdown. The human propensity for lying and cheating should be a juicy topic, but Ariely manages to squash reader interest by (mostly) confining his experiments to sterile classrooms, where one group of student volunteers after another pencil in answers to one dull test after another, usually involving dotted matrixes, one-dollar bills, and paper shredders. When Ariely and colleagues DO leave the artificial environment of the classroom -- sending a blind girl into a farmers' market to buy tomatoes, for example -- their research yields some interesting results.<br /><br />But back to that classroom ... our intrepid social scientist's big discovery is this: We all cheat, but only a little bit. And if we can just get a few reminders that cheating is bad, maybe we won't do it so much.<br /><br />That's not exactly a scientific breakthrough; it's simple common sense. And that's the brutal truth.
B009329ZF2|3.0|For many of you that thought Battle Los Angeles was just okay, this movie does surpass it in a way and I was glad to see a movie where finally the Navy takes the lead. Liam Nielson is in it but you don't get a lot of his character and not really a lot from Rhianna though both are present in the film. Both had small but mediocre parts and or lines. However, they did have some nice actions parts in the movie and at least you can see the alien, which resembles some type of human animal cross-over. This movie gets three stars because in my opinion they could have taken that great start of the movie and went further. Not to spoil it too much for the rest of you but there could be a part 2 (but highly doubt it) in the future.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is a prequel which explains \\"WICKED'S\\" initial thoughts and actions to the futuristic world's problems of vastly decreasing resources.  I highly recommend reading the original series before you read this prequel; however, it's not a requirement. Characters you root for and can relate to combined with nonstop action make this story, along with the rest of the series, a must read for any dystopian literature fan. Great job Mr. Dashner!
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|I suppose after all this time I ought not be too surprised that Dylan can still deliver an album's worth of dark powerful music unlike anything anyone else can get anywhere close to (with the possible exception of the equally remarkable Tom Waits) but he's sure as hell done it again! Loved all 10 tracks and play the cd constantly. Nothing can come close to his early stuff like Blonde on Blonde and Blood on the Tracks (who could) but this is as good, or better than any of his late career material and way better than almost anything else around just now. Keep going Bobby. You are the man!
0439813786|5.0|From the beginning of the book `Invention of Hugo Cabret', images drawn by the author caught my eyes. Instead of a boring introduction, a number of pencil drawings naturally made me sink into the story. As Brian Selznic, the author of the book, mentioned in one of his interviews, it was a brilliant idea to help children begin to read the book.<br /><br />I could not stop reading until I finished the book. There were some elements that made me keep reading. Throughout the whole first section, I was very curious about the message that Hugo's father left to his son through the automata. When I was done with the first section, I thought I would lose my interest because the secret was already revealed. When I started reading the second section, however, I realized that it is going to be even more interesting. And it really was.

B0041KKYBA|2.0|The producers of this film were on an obvious mission to blame the misery of the world on that Evil Wall Street. One only needs to look at the back of the case at the names of the featured commentators to discern the upcoming bias: Paul Volker, George Soros, Eliot Spitzer and Bawney Frank. Your usual left-wing cast of characters with an agenda. The film simplistically and non-analytically attempts to blame the financial melt-down on deregulation and the revolving employment door between Wall Street and government. It is aimed to influence the gullible general public and not critically inform. Completely lacking is ANY blame assigned to the other guilty parties, particularly the Fed, greedy homebuyers and Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac.  Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the Fed engineered artificially low interest rates (just like they are now). Those rates increased demand for houses which, in turn, caused prices to skyrocket to unrealistic and unsustainable levels. And Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac were ground zero for promoting mortgages to people would never be able to pay back. So, while there are some truths in this film, its lack of balance and completeness renders it not credible overall.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I love this show and would like to see it broadcasted forever . As Long as the dead are biting, this show will be a hit forever. In the beginning, I thought the Main character, the Cop, was a wimp . It took a while for him to grow up and realize he must act like a man . One weakness in the show is the Black male actor., who is big and strong, yet they didn't give him a decent part to play in the group and they seem to treat him as an invisible person who doesn't need to be with them. They made him a buffoon, clumsy and wimpy. At least they didn't kill him early in the movie as most movies do with Blacks male actors, unless they are well known, like Denzel Washington . Now I know there had to be a lot more people of color who would survive  a disaster because they make up 80% of the worlds population but the writers only include 3 people of color with one killed early on. . Why? I don't know. Maybe in another hundred years , people of color( Blacks, Asians, Latinos, Native Americans  ), will be seen as an equal in this country and will be more represented in movies of this nature, or any movie in this country .

B0087HT36U|1.0|The object of Siege Hero is to destroy the bad guys by throwing things at their structures. All of this is done in first, instead of third person - that is the only thing that separates it from being an exact copy of Angry Birds. You can zoom aim for extreme precision, not that you really need to as the first few dozen levels are all terribly easy.<br />I achieved a gold crown on them without any effort on my part.<br />Eventually the game does get more difficult, with hostages, tougher buildings, and the like.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Graphics in this game really are top notch, almost Angry Birds quality. The cartoony, hand drawn look really suits all the destruction that happens on screen. The animations are also quite good, with nice big puffy smoke clouds, and debris flying all over the screen.<br /><br />- Sound and music are above average, mostly upbeat tunes and cool explosion/destruction sounds.<br /><br />- You are allowed to zoom in for accurate shots.<br /><br />- There is a huge number of levels here, numbering in the hundreds.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- The game starts off incredibly easy, but eventually ramps up the difficulty to an insane level, almost forcing you to purchase Buster Bombs (that pretty much instantly clear the level for you). All of this is done with one touch because of the built in permissions. You can buy 5 for $.99 or get a \\"good deal\\" and buy 15 for just $1.99. Wow, classy.<br /><br />- There is a delay between when you clear (or lose) a level and the game actually registering it. Sometimes this can take up to a few seconds. It gets very annoying as the game has a lot of levels.<br /><br />- There are plenty of fake five star reviews all over the Amazon page. These are all coming from people with one or two reviews. Shameful. Because of this, I am also expecting a lot of downvotes. Hopefully you mange to find my review somewhere toward the bottom of the \\"unhelpful\\" heap.<br /><br />- There is built in Facebook and Twitter integration that allow you to brag about your achievements while advertising the game.<br /><br />- The physics are really screwed up and it's not uncommon to encounter floating structures with no support.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />- You are peppered with a giant, full screen, and in your face ad for MINICLIP.COM - where you can PLAY ONLINE GAMES. This thing is displayed every time you start up Siege Hero and stays there for a good six seconds. Not quite as ad free as advertised.<br /><br />- This game has a triple threat of permissions for instant IAP:<br />  - com.android.vending.BILLING - Allows for (one touch) IAP.<br />  - Open network sockets - Gives this app free range internet access<br />  - Access information about networks - Lets the app do exactly what this permission sounds like.<br />This is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME. The only reason these permissions are even here in the first place is for social media integration and IAP.<br /><br />While I think Siege Hero is worth the free download, I can't see myself paying for a game with so many issues.<br />If you have children, make sure to put your device in airplane mode (or root it and install ad/traffic blocking software) before handing it over, because buying bombs really is quite easy.

B008S7EPXA|5.0|I discovered DCD when I wanted to know who did the beautiful music at the end of Gladiator. I quickly became a fan of Lisa Gerrard and, ultimately, DCD. I've read the reviews and for me, this album is simply wonderful. Anything they do together is magic and I'm so glad they reunited for a new collaboration. I find the songs beautiful and haunting, as usual. But it's always the music that does it to me, and this effort is no exception. It's epic. I love all the songs, but Return of the She-King is my favorite.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard DCD fan, I believe you'll love this as much as I do.

B001974DG0|5.0|I have been a DK fan for years and The Watchers did not disappoint. This story explores the what-ifs of genetic research, a subject I have personal interest in. Both the good and bad outcomes are explored, using rich characters as expected in any DK novel. You will not be disappointed.
0307744434|4.0|Night Circus is a very different kind of read than I am used to.  Magic is real in this novel.  Yes, the major characters are magicians, but just like the rest of us, some of them fall in love, cut corners where they shouldn't, and create havoc in their own lives and in the lives of others.<br />  There isn't a dull page in the book.  The plot moves along briskly and the characters are intriguing.  I recommend this novel to those with enough imagination to fall under Morgenstern's spell.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe I slogged through this entire trilogy.  I've been a submissive all of my adult life and this book is just pure trash.  I'll keep this review short and sweet, but it seems EL James' goals consisted of two things: making money and mocking as many categories of individuals as she possibly could, from BDSM players to people suffering from eating disorders, to people subjected to domestic violence or any other form of abuse.  This belongs in the trash pile.  God help our society if this is what's considered literature nowadays.
B007G5K066|2.0|I've spent the last year or more immersed in \\"Smiley\\".  Listened to the full audiobooks of the whole Karla trilogy, following each one with the BBC Radio abridged version.  Watched the Alec Guinness mini-series, and couldn't wait to finally watch this version!<br /><br />But what a disappointment.  I'm not able to objectively review the movie on its own merits.  I can't see it without thinking of the books, and the mini-series.  This does not hold up.  There are some great small scenes, but the overall move just doesn't pull you in.  Worse, though, are some things they changed, for no obvious reason.  I don't consider these spoilers; they really are small parts of the movie;  But, they are small parts, so why change them?<br /><br />First and most obvious, they moved the whole Czechoslovakian incident to Hungary.  Why?  Was it cheaper?  If so, just film there, but pretend it's Czecho.  This struck a sour note from the beginning.<br /><br />Second and much more subtle, they replaced Sam Collins with Jerry Westerby.  Why?  What possible reason could they have had to swap Jerry in for Sam?  I honestly don't remember what Jerry's role was in this book, but he's the titular Honourable Schoolboy in the next book.  Did they just give him a bigger role in this movie, setting the audience up for the next possible movie?<br /><br />These are minor, but they ruined my enjoyment of the movie, and there wasn't anything else to make up for these and other shortcomings.<br /><br />Do yourself a HUGE favor.  Listen to [[ASIN:1602838623 Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (BBC Radio Full-Cast Dramatization)]] instead.
0345803493|1.0|This is pseudo-S&M to say the least.  It makes a mockery of a wonderful subculture which EL has effectively managed to push even further into the fringes of society by making Christian's sole motivation for his 'BDSM' (and I use the term loosely and with immense sarcasm) trauma undergone in childhood.  I won't even touch on how bad the writing is, because so many others before me have already done so and I wholeheartedly agree with them.  The fact that people are eating this up and using it as a baseline for their relationship says a lot about the sad state of our society, especially in terms of women's rights.
B0087HT36U|1.0|The majority of the five star reviews for this game are from the developer. The game features in app purchases, which is always in bad taste for a game that already has a purchase price.<br /><br />Very sleazy.
0345803507|1.0|I'm completely and utterly astounded at the stupidity of this whole series, in every single aspect possible.  The 3rd book was clearly identical to the other three (same boring soccer mom pseudo S&M) with a (you guessed it!) totally unoriginal ending.  Seriously, if anyone found these books sexy or a realistic guideline for a relationship, I'd advise them to read up and go see a therapist.  Bestseller?  Really?  I'm shaking my head.  As a real-life sub, I'll be so glad when this fad passes.

B0083V2VW8|3.0|My heart was broken when I watched the new release. It sucks!  Soundtrack is awful and muddy - Pete sounds like he has a lisp.  Color is terrible, washed out.  Worse yet, it took forever to figure out how to turn off the stupid audio comments and subtitles. Who wants to listen to some old git talk about a great film?  Shut it will you?<br /><br />I said 3 stars because I love Quadrophenia, the Who, and Jimmy and I always will.  This DVD is trash and Jimmy would have smashed it.
1401937519|5.0|I've been reading about NDE, afterlife, and \\"astral\\" experiences off/on for decades.  Overall, this is my favorite individual account.  It illustrates the true natural of our spiritual selves and facilitates healing on many levels.  I want to make it clear, though, while others have similar experiences and come to similar conclusions about spiritual reality and God, there are those who have near identical experience with \\"oneness\\" and do not come to the conclusion we are the same as God.  At this point in my understanding, I'm finding it more logical to say we in God, the essence of God, able to relate and experience AllThatIs through God, but it is not most accurate to say we are God. There are so many levels to reality outside of this existence, I find it a little presumptuous for a person to say I experienced \\"this\\" outside of my body, and \\"this\\" is AllThereIs/GodSelf.  (I wonder what Bob Monroe's take would be on this book.)<br /><br />Another good book on NDE experiences is Glimpses of Eternity (shared death experiences) by Raymond Moody.  Together, they've given me tremendous peace of mind.<br /><br />If you make it through those two without thinking they're more deluded than the average person, try Frank DeMarco.  His ideas on co-ordinating soul lives (not past lives, since God, Universe, Creation, AllThatIs exists at once, outside of time) were an eye-opener and affirm what others have said about how \\"past\\" lives are only past in OUR dimension.  Moorjani uses a CD analogy to explain perceptions in time.  I've used a vinyl record playing on a turntable, and wherever you drop the needle is your point in time, but. I sometimes wondered if maybe I was crazy for believing we can experience it all outside of this focus point.  Now... I am thankful, I am blessed, to know this small slice of truth.<br /><br />BTW, I read Moorjani's free online short account quite a while back and forgot about it.  I've been busy researching ideas on other levels of reality and didn't think any more NDE accounts would be helpful.  For some reason, this book came up on a side bar.  I was curious about the health applications, and decided to load it on my Kindle last night.  SO glad I did.  Additional information relating to commonly asked questions are inlcuded.  Her explainations confirmed my \\"gut\\" feelings on some spiritual ideas that are taken as complete truth in the Christian and/or New Age literature I tend to pick up (esp. in regards to forgiveness and fears of living).<br /><br />I still have a few questions and doubts about what she wrote.  For example, I don't feel inclined to share my bodily resources with most parasites and predators (unless I'm ready to pass on, then death by predator seems preferable to what happens in modern hospitial run by death-terrified humans). And I can't say I'm in agreement with any higher \\"purpose\\" that involves skeeters or ticks. ;-)  Also, I suspect people who refuse to use the concept of \\"wrong\\" and don't see a need to change the world never had a child tortured and murdered.  However, 95% of her ideas and feelings about her experience made perfect sense to me.<br /><br />I'm giving this book five stars because she's done an excellent job relating her complex \\"other life\\" experience.  And, I wholeheartedly believe the essence of our discord comes from the false judgments we've been taught to believe about ourselves.  So much of what is taught by our family, cultural tribe, one religious group or other as necessary to spiritual connection is simply not true.  The old axiom \\"follow your heart\\" and ALLOW the life force to flow through our BEING (as opposed to DOING prescribed and/or ritualized steps that \\"attract\\" certain situations and \\"stuff\\") will bring about the world we want to experience.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I've had this app on Kindle Fire for 2 days. It worked great ...NOW it doesn't. While attempting to download video an ERROR msg pops up saying to check connection when my wifi is glowing all bars, forced closed a bunch of times too. Nothing will download anymore. I know it's free but I wouldn't pay for Pro now. To bad,  it was a good app. Will try something else.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I loved this app. It was always very convenient and very helpful. I have never had problems with it until today. I have tried reinstalling it but it still wont let me watch/download anything. My wi fi is connected and I have all bars. Please fix this problem. Thank you. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book the love story and the suspense i cant wait to start book three. Absolutely love the first two
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a pinterest addict. I never feel compelled to leave reviews...but this app is great! I can finally move thru the site on my kindle with ease. I can see everyone I'm following, choose categories so much easier AND choose which board I want to pin to without any issues. Love, love, love it. One hiccup so far, just shut down and restarted.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The entire content can be summarized in three sentences:<br /><br />Ana the virgin fell in love with a sadist super rich billionare;<br />she and the sadist billionare wanted to make things work;<br />and failed for the moment.<br /><br />Reading the book is as boring as eating its papers.<br /><br />Without the porn websites, the novel could be a hit in its explicit description of the BDSM processes. But, the problem with the novel is, it is published after the internet. Thus, just as words are dominated by graphics, the book is subdued by the porn websites.<br /><br />Someone commented that it looks like a teen's work. That is insulting the intelligence of a normal teen.  The book is like being spit out of a robotic machine which can do combination and permutation of a dozen of porn words.<br /><br />Well, given such a boring book can have so many readers tricked into buying it, its plot that a super beautiful sadist controling freak can be super successful as a teen appears credible.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Does exactly what it says and more.  Incredible app!! It is my computer on my Kindle Fire.  No need for any apps like google docs or quick office pro anymore!  Makes the kindle fire a breat productivity tool now.
B0087HT36U|2.0|Payed for this app before the free day and it will not run.I have a asus tf300t with jellybean.It looks like it loaded ok but all i get is a siege hero has stopped message.WHY O WHY the pain of having waited so long to play this Yosemite Sam looking app to have my dreams dashed and to be left with the thought of what might have been.(EDITED REVIEW)After my first review i tried to load Mr mustache on my phone.Drum roll please...............IT WORKED.YEA!Now with the pain gone and my dreams fulfilled i can tell you what i really think.Its a lot like that pissed off bird game but the physics part is not nearly as intricate.You are also looking from the shooters perspective.Its a lot like the knock down the castle games we have all suffered through. The structures are  simple and boring to watch collapse.The game also plays kind of slow.There is a closeup feature that's pretty cool.In conclusion if your not worn-out on those castle knockdown games like i am or if you have kids this game might just be your ticket.What ever that means.O yea also didn't know that pirates were a part of sieges.Back to those history books for me.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Worked fine until the most recent update, now i cannot download anything or even choose to play a video on youtube without downloading it first. Another update better come along soon.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love the full version, which is handy in more ways than one.  When I don't have the means to print, I can save/print the doc to Adobe format and print it later,  when I have access to a printer.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this app is not the best app in the world but the worst but I do have to give you props
B00992CF6W|1.0|I absolutely love this game!!! I play it on the xbox and computer all the time. everyday ive been getting on the app store looking specifically for this game. I tried others such as story block. but they really weren't fun at all. like someone on here said all you do on story block is run around doing quests the entire game. as soon I saw minecraft I bought it. I didn't care what the price was because any price is worth it. very very fun game :D
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a fun and interesting one to play.  The puzzles are challenging and really make you think.  Fun for all ages and worth the money.
0120000156|5.0|This is the best book ever!I read the whole series and I loved it.It was truly suspensfull and exciting. If you like greek mythology,fantasy,or adventure you will love this book,so don't  hesitate about buying it.And if you don't you'll want to after you either borrow it from a friend or get it from the library!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this app for free. It is nice to have on my kindle fire because it lets me know exactly how much battery power I have left.  Wouldn't buy the app but since it was free, I love it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really like this app. It works great on the fire and even though the menus are kind of like angrybirds the gameplay style is a lot different and I like it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was very suspensful and had you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering whnat was going to happen next. The acting was done in such a way that you were inside their heads as though you were there. If you are looking for a movie that you can not guess the ending until you are there, then this is as good as it gets.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this, very gripping and interesting plot, probably more than The Lost Symbol, although that was a very good read too.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|it is a great game. it is a great pass time. the kids love it. I even tell other parents about it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Excellant game.  The app works very well and is fun to play. Tiles are easy to discern and are esy to match.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game and it is my fav game. everyone should buy this game so get it take the word from me
B004LWZW24|5.0|As someone who has a sleep disorder called Narcolepsy, I have found this movie easy to relate to.  It was cool to see some of the things that I experienced on video in regards to dreams and out of body experiences.  It was also rather atmospherically frightening.  I liked how there was very little violence and yet it was scary.  However, the ending was disappointing.  Perhaps I should give a spoiler alert before I continue.  I don't know why movies lately have ended sadly or without any sort of happy ending.  It makes the time that I spent watching it seem almost a waste.  But be that as it may, the good stuff in this movie, did outshine the terrible ending...  i came back a while after to change this review.  I was unaware that there would be sequels.  The depressing ending with the sequel really isnt that bad.
B0087HT36U|1.0|this game was actually fun until i beat the first level.  the next stage was completely hosed.  no buildings to shoot at, backdrop was messed up, game slowed ro almost a stand still, and vikings floating in mid air.  i thought maybe this was just one level, but the next level was the same.<br />this was very disappointing since this it seemed as if amazon may have offered a good free app for once.<br />fully disappointed!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was really good. Took some notes from battle royale but definitely made it more emotional and made you vested in the characters.

1612680011|5.0|This is a good book for no other reason than it changes the way you think about money as it really is, not as it's perceived.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is probably one of the greatest games I've played. I'm the type of person who plays a game for 3 minutes and then deletes it for a new game. That's not the case for this game. This game ishreat in so many ways and for you casual gamers, this is for you. But ifyoua a MW3 gamer you might wanna avoid this. Parents who are looking for a game for your child, look no further. Sure, there might be skeletons when you kill the people, but there isn't any blood. This is the best game ever.

0143106333|4.0|This was a good read, and definitely could be used as an educational learning tool, much like the movie.  However, the lessons aren't as deeply outlined as they are in the book.  In fact, the basic Oompa Loompa Song, is a more detailed song in the book, based on the situation of: gluttony (Augustus Gloop), greed/chewing gum all day (Violet Beauregard), Selfishness and Want for More-also greed (Veruca Salt), and last but not least, what watching tv all day does to you (Mike Teavee).<br /><br />The story line was pretty much the same, and I do Love the original movie more than the book (Gene Wilder Willy Wonka). However, I do believe that the book is something that the whole family could enjoy, and there were notable differences between movie and book: after Charlie won the Golden ticket, he didn't run into Slugworth, they didn't sign a contract prior to the tour in the Chocolate Factory, Veruca wasn't a \\"bad egg,\\" but she was a \\"bad nut\\" nut according to the squirrels (I also believe that she was a bad nut in the Johnny Depp version), Charlie didn't leave his gob stopper behind, yes they did take the elevator in the end, but Mr. Willy Wonka pressed the \\"button\\".<br /><br /> To find out more about the magic elevator ride, read the book.  Although there are things missing from the movie, it is a movie that I enjoy watching time and time again with the kids and husband. But I also like to read.  Finally, as much as I like the movie more, I highly recommend this book to children from 1-150. You can never get too old for chocolate, magical adventures, and fun.

B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a good because it has funny jokes.an you should see the end of popet master it is so funny. get it!!!!!!!
B004EPYZPS|1.0|I have to begin by confessing that Spielberg movies, with the exception of Empire of the Sun, have always bored me. If ever a director typified the standard lazy Hollywood churn-out-the-schlock mentality it's Spielberg. This movie - which I was asked to watch by a friend who likes sci-fi - actually hits a low spot because pretty much every aspect is flat. The camera work is tiresome and unimaginative, the script could have been written by a write-a-cliche computer program, the acting is one-dimensional, there is no plot, and the special effects are frankly unintentionally funny but always boring and telegraphed hours in advance. Likewise the soundtrack is... well, let's just say, this movie definitely would be better with the volume set to zero.<br /><br />In addition to being a tiresome hack job in which everyone dials in their contribution from long-distance, it's a sci-fi movie with no science and no fiction. There's basically not much of a plot (\\"hey, what if there's this weird stranded alien and like, the military capture it and torture it, and, like, you know, it escapes and starts killing people...\\") and the fact the \\"monster\\" is  putatively an alien is irrelevant - it could just as easily be a giant poltergeist or a land-capable shark.<br /><br />As always, Spielberg throws in tons of faux sentimentality (young teens rediscovering the importance of fathers... sigh....) and close-up shots than serve only to reveal that no one in this flaccid production can act.<br /><br />But all is not lost. If you are one of the many people out there who have difficulty falling asleep at the end of a stressful day, this is definitely the movie for you. It is so dreadful, so tedious, such an absolute waste of time and money that you'll be sound asleep within twenty minutes of the opening sequence. And for that contribution to somnolence everywhere this movie deserves the one star rating I've given it.
1589949811|5.0|This is a great game with exciting possibilities. I can't wait to purchase ALL the expasions for this game to play with my friend. Buy this game so they will keep making more adventure packs.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I had seen the DVD original version and was curious about the extra content. I have only watched half so far but the extras make the movie so much better! I was a little disappointed in the box but was surprised by the inside cover. Very worth buying and arrived early than anticipated.
B00622BF40|5.0|This movie is a step by step guide to how the magic of dance can set you free. Before I watched this movie I was lost and alone without anything to help inspire me to wake up the next day. I shuffled to and fro on my daily grind without much hope for the future. But then Strictly Ballroom entered my life! Through the magic of dance, bouffant hair, and the sweet musical stylings of Time After Time I've found that through dance and musical expression magic has once again entered my life. When I go to buy a sandwich from the store, dancing my way from my apartment to the grocery, small children dance along with me. Both women and men swoon and small birds complete my dance steps like feathered streamers from my hands and feet. Sometimes the clouds part and the sun itself shines a spotlight down on me.<br /><br />I can't suggest this movie enough - both as entertainment and a life defining self help cinematic masterpiece that will change both who you are as a person as well as your feelings about dancing in front of giant coke signs.

B000002HHB|5.0|I immediately fell in love with this album, after the first listen; the songs are all very well written, and there are many many jewels in this album; \\"San Andreas Fault\\" is wonderful, together with \\"Beloved wife\\", \\"River\\", \\"Carnival\\", \\"The letter\\", \\"Cowboy romance\\"; But the song I love so strongly I can't say is \\"I may know the word\\"; I listen to it, again and again, and I never get tired of it. The best song in this album.<br />Love the whole album, a real masterwork.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I simply do not know what all the fuss was about...It's amazing what word of mouth and \\"The New York Times\\" best seller list can produce.  The major twist was interesting..and that was it, as far as i was concerned.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|This movie is one of the most boring movies I have seen since the Twilight series. This is a total waste of time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|With all the rave reviews this series was getting, I was expecting a decent book with an interesting plot. And for $6, I didn't have a whole lot to lose. I was blown away by the beautiful prose, complex story, and engaging characters. Definitely worth a read!
B008XG1X18|3.0|crashes a lot but love the app when it works! startup sometimes fails but after a few attempts it will eventually work.
B0087HT36U|4.0|to those that think it is a rip off of A.B. are not completly correct. this game has enough different elements to keep you on your toes while providing you a nice destructive distraction. all in all a very decent app for a buck that was a dollar off :)
B0076XIS4O|5.0|Electronica?  EDM?  New classical?  Bubblegum pop?  Whatever, this album surprised me with its infectious originality, accessible yet complex, bouncing and fun.  Gotta get the others by this band I never heard of, Grime?

B000NQRE1E|5.0|The past has an unreal quality about it, especially events that occurred before we were born.  For those who survived the sinking, no doubt, had vivid, life-long memories of that terrible night; for them, these were living memories.  For the rest of us, we can study the Titanic to death, but it will be only an academic exercise; it will not feel real.  Movies about historical events almost never achieve a sense of reality, however Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" comes close.  If feels real; perhaps as close as you will ever get to having a living-memory-like experience of Titanic's passengers and crew. . . .<br /><br />For example, you can feel the exhilaration and excitement as the ship steams out into the ocean for the first time; you feel it in the music, you can sense it in the way the massive ship slices through the water, and you can see it in Captain Smith's face as he commands: \\"Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.  Let's stretch her legs!\\"<br /><br />As you watch the fictional romance develop between the free-spirited Jack Dawson and the blossoming Rose DeWitt Bukater and her falling-out with her overbearing fiancee and controlling mother, you can easily count the days of the cruise: from the coast of Ireland on the 11th to the icy Labrador currents on the 14th.<br /><br />And finally, you witness Smith's fateful decision.  Before leaving the bridge for the night, he listens to Mr. Lightoller's concern - that spotting large icebergs will be difficult due to lack of breakers at their base.  Indeed, the sea is as smooth as the tea in Smith's cup.  He silently weighs the risks ... and decides: \\"Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. . . .\\"<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray - 2012): 5.

B008D19WBQ|2.0|I'm a huge fan of \\"Friends,\\" in fact it's probably my favorite TV show of all time. Interestingly, I didn't start watching the show until it was in its 9th season. I dismissed it as a \\"chick show,\\" but when I finally started catching re-runs when I was in college, it had me rolling! It was right at this point that they began releasing the full seasons on DVD. So every time a new season was released on DVD I went right out and bought it. The first time that I saw many of these episodes (probably 80% of the series) was on DVD. For those of you that don't know this, the DVDs actually contained longer episodes than what had been originally broadcast on NBC. Each 20-minute episode contained another 2 or 3 minutes of dialogue/story. And it wasn't excessive stuff that needed to be cut, many of my favorite lines in the show were in these extended scenes. In fact, when I go back and watch re-runs of the show now I can't believe how much of it is missing. I still love my DVDs though, special features and all! But when I watch them now on my 47\\" TV I notice that they look pretty rough. There's lots of pixelation and fuzziness, and the episodes aren't formatted for widescreen. Certain channels have been showing the episodes in HD and they look gorgeous! I thought to myself, \\"I would actually buy the whole series over again on Blu-Ray if it had all the extended episodes and bonus features from the standard DVD set.\\"<br /><br />When I learned that \\"Friends\\" was coming to Blu-Ray I was so excited, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Then I learned that this Blu-Ray boxed set would not contain the previously released extended episodes, but would instead have them as they appeared in the original NBC broadcast. Warner Home Video's reason for this is as follows: \\"The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.\\"  ...What does THAT mean? You can transfer the short episodes but not the long ones? That makes no sense! Whatever was done to clean up the episodes that they've been showing on TV in HD, they can do for the extended episodes. I think someone just got lazy and decided this would be good enough. While I desperately want my favorite show in HD, I will not fork out over $200 for an inferior product! I know these (extended) episodes like the back of my hand, and I won't be able to truly enjoy the show with the absence of so many great scenes and lines. I'd rather watch bad resolution \\"Friends\\" in its entirety than watch a cleaned up abridged version. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it's still an awesome show, and for casual fans this might be enough. However, for fans like me this will simply not do. This reminds me of George Lucas only releasing the versions of Star Wars that nobody likes, or Peter Jackson putting out The Lord Of The Rings trilogy on Blu-Ray but waiting over a year to put out the extended versions. Warner Home Video won't be getting my money this time. Try again, guys!t makes no sense!

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John carter is the best movie of 2012! as a writer my self i can tell you there was nothing wrong with the writing nor anything else. Point blank one of the most inspirational movies I've seen in a long time. and the score was perfectly matched.. i mean the scene where john carter decides o fight for the first time in the movie was just wow! all the emotions they captured! definitely watch and are pushing for number 2!

B0086700CM|4.0|I love the game but I was scooping through the players that u could buy and it gave me a football player I was not even looking to buy. it is a really fun game though
B0087HT36U|5.0|Mellow out everyone. This is not an angry birds rip off at all. Actually I like it much better than AB. I am not a developer by any stretch just someone who loves games. I've no doubt this will be one of my favorites for some time. Glad it was the faotd or I would have skipped right over it. It's free! If you don't like it or it won't work on your device just delete it and move on. Stop blasting the devs and Amazon. Sheez.

B005LAII6M|1.0|I am a hardcore fan of the R.E. games, but this franchise is taking a skydive in the movie sector.  This latest movie was just flat out bad.  they keep repeating the same formula from the last few movies to exhaustion. (slow motion blood splatter, boss monsters, and that lame annoying albert wesker character)  this is the 5th entry to the franchise i think and the story goes no where, same platform, same incomplete ending that leaves it open for yet another movie ...enough already it's  really getting sad.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Well written, it kept me interested throughout. Could not put it down. Moved along in a manner that kept me guessing about what would happen next. It is the first book from this author that I have read, I would recommend this book as a very good read.

1439199388|5.0|Moises Velasquez-Manoff's book \\"An Epidemic of Absence\\" is nothing less than revolutionary.  Speaking as a physician, we have known for some years about the mysterious connection between \\"hygiene\\" and some allergic diseases such as asthma; however, the mechanism and evolutionary history involved have been mostly unexplored.  Velasquez-Manoff rigorously lays out a detailed synthesis of what cutting-edge scientists have discovered about the connections between autoimmune disease (asthma, allergies, arthritis, inflamatory bowel disease etc.) and the recent eradication of symbiotic bacteria and intestinal parasites in the modern world.  He is very thorough in his review of the current scientific knowledge about the topic, and is able to weave together parts of this puzzle giving the reader a front row seat in the unfolding of a new chapter of our understanding of human health.  The author tells this story from a personal and sometimes humorous perspective, taking us on a fascinating journey through our bodies and evolution. As a physician, a father, and as a human, I can tell you that this will be one of the most important books you will read, illuminating your understanding of human health and our connection to the living world around us (and inside us)!
0307730697|5.0|Biographies and memoirs of Navy SEALs seem to be coming out an an ever-increasing pace these days.  Some of the early ones, including Richard Marcinko's [[ASIN:0671795937 Rogue Warrior]] and Chuck Pfarrer's [[ASIN:0891418636 Warrior Soul: The Memoir of a Navy Seal]], paint the SEALs as one part superhuman and the other part psycho, almost as if they had watched too many action movies in the 80s.  While I have the highest respect for these men and their accomplishments, the cockiness and arrogance can grate on the reader after a while.<br /><br />More realistic and humble portraits emerged with Marcus Luttrell's [[ASIN:0316044695 Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10]] and Howard Wasdin's [[ASIN:1250006953 SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper]].  The warriors portrayed in these book were no less formidible than their predecessors, but they are more real and, therefore, more endearing.<br /><br />Eric Blehm's book, Fearless, is in the latter category.  It tells the life story of SEAL Team Six operator, Adam Brown, who overcame significant obstacles--both physical and spiritual--to become one of the most elite warriors in the world.  Brown's story is multi-faceted and truly inspiring.  We see him as a man with an indefatigable spirit who put himself in harm's way again and again in the war against terror, but who could come home days later, flip on the daddy switch, and clown around with his children.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a Christian, but not the neat and clean stereotype.  He had significant struggles, and the author does not shy away from them.  Indeed, it was Brown's desire that his full story be told, so that it could give hope to others who struggle.  I could not stop tears from rolling down my cheeks as I read the final chapters.  By that point, I was so invested in Brown and his family and his team members that it was all real for me, as if I knew them personally.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm has done his homework and written a story that rings true.  This is a real page-turner.  I would have read it all in one sitting, if I had not started so late at night (so I finished it the next day).  Highly recommended.Blehm has done his homework and written a story that rings true.  This is a real page-turner.

B0081J9OWC|4.0|I am a huge fan of the first Edward Sharp album, and while I still enjoyed this one quite a bit, it doesn't seem to be as prolific in my mind. It features the female singer Jade much more than Alex, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just find Alex's voice to have greater diversity than Jade's. That being said, there are definitely some catchy songs on here that you'll want to listen to, especially if you're already a fan.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|its a fun game. I love how complex it is. It really gets me thinking on how to solve the puzzles in different ways.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|Usually a movie without humans in it and a title like this one would come across as rather childish fare, but this was a beauty. The visuals are so good that they are perfect for showing off your home theater, as is the sound quality. The animation is also superb. The story is predictable, but still quite interesting. Well worth the money.
B009329Y30|3.0|This is definitely just one of those sweet chick flick kind of films.  It's probably not something you'll watch over and over again and it probably won't be your favourite movie.  I'm glad I saw it once, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.  It was sweet, heartwarming, followed a very typical plot, but didn't have much depth to it.  I thought the way it was filmed was kind of weird.  There were a lot of those kind of fade in, show scenes with background music, fade out to next scene kind of parts.  They made me feel like a lot of time was passing, but made it hard to understand exactly how much time.  It also made it hard to really get to know the characters and the romantic relationship that develops.<br /><br />The ending seemed awfully clich&eacute; and convenient, but I assume that's how it actually ended in the book so I don't blame the movie for that.  But I haven't actually read the book, so I could be wrong.<br /><br />The Lucky One wasn't that memorable, but it's a good movie if you're in the mood for something romantic with family and emotions.
B000MAK648|3.0|Director John Frankenheimer fostered a decades-long love for cars. [[ASIN:B000ERU9S2 Ronin]], released in 1998, book-ends his career. Shortly before his death, he also directed one of the BMW Films shorts starring Clive Owen.<br /><br />Grand Prix combines the soap opera sentimentality of the original [[ASIN:B0087ZG7Q6 Airport]] with the cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute; of Claude Lelouch's infamous [[ASIN:B000CFL6DS C'&eacute;tait un Rendezvous]]. Yves Montand is top-notch, and James Garner is good, but the female characters are almost universally unlikable. The not-so-romantic storylines weigh down this film, as does the near three-hour-long running time. No matter--the on-location footage of F1 races throughout Europe is the real star.<br /><br />Verdict: stellar racing cinematography, but not a very compelling film.<br /><br />Caught this ON DEMAND, but the 2-disc [[ASIN:B000FFJYCU DVD]] with lots of special features looks like a deal on sale for ten bucks.

1577314808|5.0|I can't get over the bad reviews of this book. Some criticize Tolle as a person, but this has nothing to do with the message of the book.<br />Others say that there is \\"nothing new\\" in his writing. SO WHAT?!!!!<br />This is a powerful book and if you make a sincere effort to work at it, and curtail your compulsive thinking,<br />you will absolutely reap great rewards. Yes, the message of the book is simple, to be sure, but the practice<br />of mindfulness is NOT simple at all. The mind is like a snake, and it takes a monumental effort to control<br />the mind.<br />Stopping compulsive thoughts is the key to gaining higher states of awareness. I have read and reread this book many many<br />times over the years, and it never gets stale for me. Present moment awareness, a fierce focus on the now, really IS<br />a great cure for much of what ails us.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|okay so when i first started reading this i didnt get it but as the story went on i got the hang of it and i loved Cato! what can go wrong wirh some hot bad boy!?!  even though i hated that rue had to die (it was going to happen anyways katniss was always supposed to win and here is only one victor.......... in this case two) i thought that its was heart pounding. and for one thing i would NOT want to be in the hunger games it freaked me out it the pulf scenes (BtW a pulf is a pug wolf you would know if u say the movie. wel its not hard to be scared like it was crazy.  Oh and im a team Cato and Gale : ) !!! I thought that afer the hinger games they would go back to liking each other you know??? but stupid capitol brought the to the arena AGAIN....... Im mad...i mean what the .... PRIM DIES IN THE LAST BOOK :(<br />but i loved the fact there is a strong heroine, katniss, and as i read the end there was an epolge....

037571457X|5.0|Persepolis is colorful and disturbing tale of the personal toll on one family after the overthrow of Iranian government by extremists. Told from the perspective of a young girl, the book details the intimate effects of a crushing regime suddenly taking hold of a country. At times it reminded me of the chilling fiction book \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" by Margaret Atwood.

B004JQN4WM|5.0|i recently purchased the nile crocodile by papo and i had 9 dollars left and knew i had seen that price before. i purchased this knowing i would have a new king in my Dino collection as well as an animal which i could use to finally play zoo with my sisters. when they got here i was so excited! the ankylosaurus dosen't disappoint in the least! now,i don't have any other papo dinos,but i've seen pictures,and i have to say without a doubt their all great,but this guy's my fave! a perfect yellow belly with brown back makes him look armored and provides guidelines as to where his weak point is. now this is big for some but i'm okay with it,the back has spikes. they appear to be bone and look awesome! now his eyes aren't a disappointment,more of a shocker. their orange with pupils,which i never in a million years would have expected to be the color. now in his mouth,it's not articulated like their t rex and other carnivorous dinos (actually,i don't think any of papos herbivores have mouth movement.) but it is colored and has a tongue perfectly sculpted. next it's paint has a glossy finish to make it appear more reptilian. his tail is awesome looking but if any complaint it is that the tail is to high to hit almost any of my dinos,then again papo dinos are made to fight other papo dinos,not the ones i have from the animal planet dino family pack,so i can't really fairly complain. it's pose suggests a head on fight of pure hatred! (basically,i'm saying he looks like he could kill any other Dino within a mile!) it's smaller than expected,but that makes it even better to fight my other dinos! if you asked me to make an ankylosaurus how i would want it to look,this would be dead on! papo read my mind! best ankylosaurus toy out there,and an awesome price to! he hasen't lost a battle yet!

B008B11R1Q|3.0|As a tinnitus sufferer I have to admit that's it's very comforting to listen to an album as sedately noiseless as Coexist, but as a music fan i'd have to say it's more than a little uninspiring. I'm only gonna live once, so on balance I'd rather risk causing further damage to my cochlear than feel as though i'm being completely unchallenged by the sounds emanating from my amply sized speakers. This year i've heard a tonne of good music, but the really great albums have been from perennial noise beasts like Swans, Ty Segall and newly turned Emo kings Cloud Nothings. All these blast beats; distroted guitars, and screaming vocals sound frickin orgasmic to hear, but they also really take their toll on me oohos (Clockwork Orange reference it's russian for ears ;) So when i listened to The XX's latest album i was hoping for another minimalist masterpiece like their eponymous debut, instead i got a pretty, but dull LP that doesn't really go anywhere.<br /><br />The dynamic interplay that flourished on The XX with tracks like \\"Crystalized\\", \\"Islands\\" and \\"Intro\\" are completely absent on Coexist, songs instead just seem to play around with a particular motif and then vanish for the next one to pop up and do exactly the same thing. Occasionally an additional element is added to provide texture to these threadbare arrangements, like the use of strings in \\"Tides\\" or steel drums in \\"reunion\\" but they too just tend to limp along with the all other instruments rather than coalescing into anything remarkable. Opener \\"Angels\\" is probably the only example on this album where their trademark minimalsim actually pays dividends, it's a gorgeous song and probably the only one good enough on Coexist to have made it onto their debut.<br /><br />It may sound like i'm overly down on this album with scarce mention of it's strengths to be found anywhere in the previous two paragraphs, but i'm not. It's a decent LP with some tender lyricism, delicate piano and inviting reverb-y guitars that i'dbe foolish to completely disregard, seeing as though they were a vital component of what made their self titled debut album so special. However it's the serious lack anything other than the aforementioned on Coexist that makes it sound so patently inferior to it's predecessor. With their debut they never rested on their laurels and just relied on a nice a guitar sound and some laconic lyrics to get them through the song, they brought excitable hooks, memorable melodies and above all else an abundance of restrained passion and personality. All these things are sadly missing here and result in a sophomore album that's easily to listen to, but difficult to care about.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a game that makes you think but you can relax while doing it. The music also has a calming, tranquil effect.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The Hunger Games movie brilliantly captures the essence of the first book in the trilogy by Suzanne Collins. From the bleak and gray District 12, to the ridiculously fashionable and indulgent Capitol, the movie accurately depicts many characters and scenes from the novel. If you haven't read the book, the basic premise is that many years in the future, the country of Panem (basically North America) is divided into 12 districts and ruled by one president. Every year, a teenage boy and girl from each district are selected via a lottery system to participate in the Hunger Games. The resulting 24 tributes are trussed up and paraded around the Capitol before being thrust into an arena where only one will survive. Katniss, the strong and brave central character, must utilize her cunning and resourcefulness to win the games. However, with her fate determined by the gamekeepers, and her growing relationship with Peeta, the other district contestant, the odds of her survival are slim.<br /><br />I am a firm believer in that books are generally better than film adaptations. And while that remains true in this case, I thought that the movie was able to portray the book pretty similarly to how I had imagined it. There were many relationships between Katniss and other characters- her mother, Rue, Peeta, Gale- that I wish would have been further explored, but I think the filmmakers did the best they could in the limited time available. My only complaint is that I did not enjoy the shaky-camera effect. It made it hard to focus on the scene and sometimes was kind of dizzying. I understand the images they were trying to create, but it was a little overdone, in my opinion.<br /><br />Please note that while the movie is not overly gory or bloody, there are some scenes that might be too violent for viewers under 13. The subject matter itself is pretty gruesome and might frighten children. I do recommend the movie and the book for more mature audiences.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down because after seeing the movie I wanted to know more about what happened next.  I had to finish it in one day and then order the next one.  Very good writing and suspense and adventure.  My grandaughter has just read these and it is still good for a grandmother.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I liked this one. I am running it on a stock ics 4.0.4 Verizon galaxy nexus and it works fine. it does get more difficult as you play and so can get frustrating.,
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A quick read, so very interesting.  It is hard to put this book down.  A heartrending story of the South, slavery and oppression and how slaves and indentured servants dealt with their situations and tried to make the most of their lives.  An excellent book.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm not much of a gamer but after hearing all the hype about the Angry Birds craze I decided to download and try for myself. The game is very addictive and must say I plan on trying the related games as well. Only recommendation is to make sure your device battery is fully charged and all of your chores/projects are done for the day before playing.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I liked the movie.  Not much else to say.  I'd recommend watching it.  When I rate movies it's typically a yes or a no... and this movie is a yes in my book :)
B001HN6EF4|5.0|We have enjoyed being able to play this game poolside or while sitting in the hot tub.  The cards can get wet and then we just leave them on the table to dry!
B009ARMP7U|5.0|I have been a huge Glee fan from the start.  This is the best the show has been in a long while. Great story and split of cast.  I am really looking forward to see the genesis of this season.

This was a 3 part web series, it's a musical and its awesome! You'll hate the hero, fall in love with the villian(s), and feel indifferent about the girl ha! Plus there are so many special features it could choke a Bad Horse! ;)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book - Well defined characters, good story-line, kept me interested throughout, but couldn't put the book down towards the end...Story line could easily become a movie someday (and possibly reality - yikes!!)...<br /><br />Ordered the next book in the series \\"First Shift - Legacy\\" hoping it will be a continuation of Wool...Thanks Hugh!!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr sets the Tony Stark/Iron Man Marvel character in their rightful place.... bad@ss!!  Watched this movie and all the Iron Man movies (Iron Man, IM2, and The Avengers) multiple times and got the \\"first time jitters\\" each time. Highly recommended!!!
B00514HDNW|5.0|I just finished this story, and I love it. Matheson really wrote a unique story here. After you read it, you can see how it became an inspiration for much of the horror to come after it. What I really wanted to talk about however, is how it compares to the hardback/paperback version. Buyers should just beware that unlike the print edition, this version is just \\"I Am Legend.\\" The print version contains several other short stories. However, the progress bar at the bottom still goes by the full-length book, so I was confused for some time. However, since the price is low, I don't fault anyone or subtract from the score for it. This is still a great read for anyone who loves horror with a bit of science.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|The game is pretty kickass. I personally love Samurais. So if you do too, you might like this one. Only thing is you might not like the fact that you don't actually attack, but you get to do some nice combinations

B0087HT36U|5.0|It will get compared to Angry Birds but is different enough to be a completely different experience. Definitely a lot of fun.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|I cant say that I was scared more than this one, but it has its moment. It goes to the sister of the first girl. Shows a bit more of the mystery. Little scares here and a surprise at the end. Yeah, I almost came out of my seat again, (the first one scare the be-jesus out of me!)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app on a nearly daily basis. Very intuitive and easy to navigate. You can make lists, either just a straight written list or a checklist, and place events on the calendar. You can choose a calendar view, or a list or grid of notes you've made. My most used lists are my menus, my to - do lists, and also just some notes to myself. You can put a password on whichever lists you would like. You can color code your lists as well, and select how they are displayed, whether alphabetically or by last used. I recommend this for those of us who get ideas in their heads they may forget and just want to jot notes here and there, to those who live by lists and checklists. I even use it to store some of my passwords. Great on the go way to store everything from brain farts to a basic outline of the next great American novel.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book was a great read with a lot of easy to use techniques. I do tend to be a listener but realized after reading this book that I was not really focusing on what others were saying. People are fairly transparent about things that are important to them. Using Robin's techniques to really focus on what a person is saying, it doesn't take much to get a person to open up and feel a rapport.<br /><br />What I found very interesting is how I could relate to how his wife feels. Okay, I know it's not supposed to be about me, but I do understand how it can be hurtful when you're the person others gravitate to because you're a good listener but not have it reciprocated. It does validate my feelings, but I too have accepted it's how I'm wired and will continue to be that \\"go to\\" person. And that's okay, because, it's not all about me.

B0087HT36U|3.0|The game appears to be fun even if it is similar to angry birds but it locks up after a level or two on the Motorola atrix 4g. I have to force quit the application or it freezes the phone up.  It is a bummer because the parts I have been able to play are fun. I would give it a 5 star review if it didn't have the issues it has running.

B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This cutter certainly wasn't the easiest thing to assemble, so be sure to read and follow the instructions carefully.  Once assembled though it is fairly simple to use.  It took a couple bottles before we figured out just what kind of pressure is needed to score the glass properly and  to make sure to go all the way around twice.  The suggestions about boiling water and ice water were a great help as well.  Placing the bottle in boiling water after scoring and then transferring to ice water makes for a quick and clean break.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Everything about this movie is good except for the fundamental premise. Why would anyone think that a good way to pacify a subject people would be to kidnap their children and televise their gruesome deaths? This is the absolute opposite of reality! Every time I was getting close to losing myself in the movie, I would remember how absolutely moronic the basic premise was, and out I would come. Despite all the good qualities that this movie does have, I can't imagine watching it a second time or watching a sequel. It's just not good enough to make me forget what utter nonsense it is.

Crime, ethnic history, drugs,  money, failure,  redemption.  One of the all time greats.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Doctorron
B005FISBTO|5.0|Another Season of Dexter.  Has some good twists and turns.  I just wish there were more episodes so I could watch it more!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The battery app is awesome.  It takes the guesswork out of reading the tiny battery in the corner.  The percentage is very accurate.
B0087HT36U|1.0|I just downloaded and installed this app and it won't open or start on my Xoom.  It immediately<br /> sends a message 'unfortunately Siege Hero has stopped'.  It then offers no option to report the problem, or to try a reinstall.  All you can do is hit 'OK' and leave the program.  I would love to try the product, and will update my review to a more favorable one, if they would fix it.
B003VANOFY|1.0|just received my g930's today and they will be returned Monday i saw the other reviews about people saying the sound cut out and said to myself maybe ill get lucky and this wont happen to me ......i was wrong within 15 min of use the connection started to cut out every 5-10 min do not waste your money on these
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love this on My kindle fire. the graphics are great and its so much fun. don't waste<br />. 99 on the paid angry birds its not worth it. trust me
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow...  Sex was lame.. and that is about all the book was.<br /><br />This book is beyond soft porn. Not only is it poorly written...  but the small parts that are actually the relationship are dry and disjointed.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|better on a tablet, but its pretty fun for the price. I lik plants vs zombies and its giving my son lessons in strategy.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Wow, I don't think I've ever seen so many fake reviews. If this game is trying to copy AB it's doing a poor job of it. The physics are really bad. I mean c'mon. Pieces hanging in mid air? While I have encountered a few challenging levels, I've gotten the gold crown in most of the levels in the first or second try. On one level that I was having a hard time with the game asked me if I wanted to buy some bombs. No thank you. The lag between levels, sometimes 6 or 7 seconds long was beyond annoying and frustrating. When it started repeatedly missing the mark where I tapped I gave up.<br /><br />com.android.vending.BILLING<br />Open network sockets.<br />Access information about networks.<br />  again, no thank you.<br /><br />It could have been a fun, challenging game if Miniclip had taken the effort they put into trying to get more money and put it into the game itself.<br /><br />I did not see any ads except for the one for Miniclip, but I played with my wifi turned off. Graphics are good and it works on Kindle Fire. That's about all the good I have to say about it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|very good game. the missions add a lot to the fun. you  can do it over and over again. i enjoy it very much.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Bought the most expensive boss thinking they would be the best headphones. One of the ears stopped working after a month. These headphones are just as good of not better for a third of te price. Great for mixing music and getting the whole experience.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a fun game. I have a Toshiba Thrive device and the game works great. keep games like this coming.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I read a great deal of mysteries, same old, same old. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle knows how to keep your attention, it's seldom I figure out 'who done it' before the end.

1451683405|3.0|\\"Free will is an illusion. We don't have as much freedom as we think we do.\\" So says Sam Harris. Now I'm not going to agree or disagree what I learned from this book. At only 72 pages, it is rather short. But there will be many paragraphs read over and over again. Sometimes you'll stop to even ponder what Harris is saying, which can make your brain do back flips. Including some material that was quiet unsettling to me, and questioning my own actions. I wont say what, that is up for you to decide, whether you think you'll decide to buy this or not, you really cant know.<br />Although short, the book does give some fabulous insights and questions about free will that everyone surely has thought about in his or her life. Harris's knowledge of philosophy, theology and neuroscience adds many different views and ideas towards free will.<br />3 and a half stars for \\"Free Will.\\"
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fantastic. Easy to play.easy to follow.Most of all its free. Its a perfect  game for all ages. Even adults will like thus game.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|angry birds except ad free.  Children like this game more than I do , so ad free means less of me freaking out on what they clicked on.
0634049011|1.0|I started playing a lot of years ago.  I am now taking some time to start back up again.  I had heard about the CAGED theory.  I thought that this would put a jump start into my refresher to guitar.  I have seen some CAGED instruction on line that seemed interesting.  This book is poorly organized and what there is in the book is too fundamental for an experienced player.  I would say it would be too confusing for any one that is starting to learn guitar.  I should remember from my years of learning the guitar that practice makes perfect.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Amazing game as always, free always makes it even better. I had this game on the iphone and now i have it on the android.
B008Y2IU12|1.0|I was hesitant because of all the Kristen Stewart bashing going around these days. I am a big fan of Chris Hemsworth and  Charlize Theron. I mean, on paper this should have been a good movie.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />The script is disjointed and forced. The plot has so many holes it would give a Humvee problems. Kristen Stewart is actually pretty bad. Very odd expressions and her emotional range is as bad as the internet memes indicate. She delivered a few of her lines fine, but I get the feeling the director gave up about half way through the movie.<br /><br />Even Charlize and Chris aren't at their best here. Some sparks of brilliance showing through.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is the 7 dwarves. I wish they had spent more time on these guys and less time on a senseless love triangle that never resolves anyway.<br /><br />Also, the fantasy elements seem very slapdash. Even a good fantasy system has some rules and some definition. You never really get that here. I mean, I still am not really sure what gives Snow White any ability here to charm a troll? Maybe there was something I missed with the fairies... i fell asleep for about 10 min in the middle.<br /><br />What is with Kristen Stewart, I mean, every time she seems to be summoning some kind of emotion, she usually just looks like she is passing some really bad gas.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to watch Snow White, stick with the animated version, its still the best. If you want to see Charlize, watch 7 Days in the Valley and if you want to see Chris at his best, watch the first 10 min of Star Trek (2009). If you want to see Kristen Stewart, I can't help you, maybe go see an eye doctor or a shrink.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is super cool and I think its good for passing time. It also is like a bunch of apps rolled into one
B0062NAVXA|5.0|HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE STORY LINE. IT WAS ALL THEY SAID IT WOULD BE.WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FILMS THAT INSTILL VALUES  SHOWN IN THIS FILM..
B007TMON8M|5.0|SimplePhysics is an awesome game for the kindle fire! It has difficult levels but is entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzle games.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Absolutely love the big display! l use it all the time when travelling and at work. Accurate and user friendly. I highly recommend!
0385742886|2.0|Let me start by staying that I love the Maze Runner series!  I thought it was an interesting concept and gave a bit more of a \\"boyish\\" spin on the dystopian thing.  So I was quite excited when I heard that there would be a prequel.  I knew that some details about how this had all come to be had been revealed in the trilogy, but I figured it would be interesting to see it al play out.  Unfortunately, I found this book downright boring at times.  I wasn't attached the the characters.  There was no real sense of mystery because you knew from the beginning pretty much everything.  And most of the book was spent with the characters running away from zombies.  The book had so much potential, but in the middle I found myself starting to skim just wanting to see how it ended.  There was just little meat in the middle.  I wish I had just skipped this one and stuck with the original trilogy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so glad they added Pinterest as an app! I use it all the time. I really like pinning to my boards this way. I always pin, then go back and check out my pins. LOVE IT!!!
B006OOHYIC|3.0|Below is my previous, 5-star review. Recently this game was updated and deleted my progress in the game.<br /><br />Guiding notes introduce new elements but make me feel like it's a journey, not as much a game. I got it via the free daily app offer, but this is the best I've played so far.
B007MDB71O|3.0|I can see why the movie wasn't a big hit in the theaters.  It wasn't spectacular and it wasn't horrible.  It was okay.  But people expected fantastic and didn't get it.  They, in turn, felt it was junk and trashed it.  That was perhaps unfair but I don't think that JC deserves 5 stars on Amazon either.  Still, glad a lot of people really love it as I like to see Disney do well.<br /><br />What barely elevates this average actioner with cool special effects is the very end.  There are a couple of twists that occur that I won't spoil and that won't be expected and, importantly, the formerly unlikable John Carter finally becomes a likable character.  Seriously, the dude is unlikable pretty much throughout the entire movie.  He's a griseled, nail-spittin' Civil War cavalryman who is embittered and living for himself.  His transformation is slow and not well-drawn throughout the movie.  He's largely a resistance fighter, even by movie's end.  What saves him is his need for and ability to fall back into love.<br /><br />The bonus features have a nice historical retrospective of \\"The Princess of Mars\\" storyline and on Edgar Rice Burroughs himself, both of which are far more interesting than the movie (how'd they manage that?), and are worth watching even if you didn't really dig on the movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|easy to pin or search boards. loading additionsl pins is akward and app has to restart often. no problems other than that.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Smooth quick just like the original. Just like the web page. If an ebay person ypu must download this app for your device.
B0087HT36U|1.0|This app doesn't start on the galaxy nexus running jelly bean.  I never really liked miniclip anyway but I thought I'd give them a try.  Fix it and I may begin to have a change of heart about you.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|An expertly-crafted blend of sci-fi, action, mystery, and adventure. An eye-opening prequel to my favorite trilogy. Generally simple language, so kids can be reading for the diction while young adults can read simply for the plot.
B003YOXIVW|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this release when I owned on cassette.  I wore that out.  Broke down and bought the cd.  Enjoy it and cd appears to be good quality
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great. The need for me to constantly charge my battery has been reduced.  I play a lot of games, read lots of books and watch movies, all without the need to recharge. This app allows me to take my Fire with me everywhere.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Awesome, awesome book. Funnier than hell too. I was very impressed. Ozzy has lived a hell of a life and despite all his \\"extra curricular activities\\" has done a great job of taking the reader into the crazy world of rock 'n' roll music during its heyday and the role he played in it. The man is a walking, living, breathing legend and should be knighted by the Queen immediately. Cheers.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it was definantly worth 3 bucks it is the best angry birds yet it is the awsomest one yet! I like the zero gravity in the space

B008S4YZCO|4.0|it was decent game and was cool and fun but is a lot of work and kind Sucks after awill
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app worked great at first, and I know all the other reviews said this, but its true.It would not work after I downloaded a few videoes, it just said &quot;net work connection not responding, check your connection &quot;. Well that's bull.
B009329Y30|5.0|I liked it much more than any of the other Nicholas Sparks movies that were made into movies. Much better than The Notebook. Still a bit cheesy (a chick flick, for sure), but not as cheesy as a lot of the other romance movies out there. I thought the backs tory of the main character's experience in the Marines was heart-wrenching. Good flick.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|After i figured out all of the tools I couldnt put it down!!great game..very addictive.  Always want to try and beat my last time!!
B0086700CM|5.0|the graphics are outstanding. the game is highly addictive and a blast to play. my favorite game by far. works great on kindle fire. a must have!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is a great action packed movie. The skyscraper scene is awesome but a little scary especially if you're scared of heights. I recommend this movie highly!!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack is a great game. Very addictive with lots of fun and cool gadgets to collect. The only drawback is compatibility so far. The game plays fine on my tab 2 7.0 and my spectrum but has tremendous lag when I play it on my wife's galaxy s3. Strange in that it's suppose to have the most powerful processor but plays the worst. But other than that it is fantastic.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Works on the Galaxy S III without issue.<br /><br />So it's a bit like Angry Birds. So what? I LIKE Angry Birds, and so far, I LIKE this game too! Graphics are ok, there are enough levels to keep me occupied for a while, so I'm going to download and have some fun while avoiding the IAP. I hate those!
B009AHWLHE|5.0|Resident Evil: Damnation improves upon the first Resident Evil CG movie, Degeneration, by leaps and bounds! Not only did Capcom tweak the appearances of the characters (and for the better!) when in comparison to the last movie, they also took many demands of the fans to heart. A good part of the appeal of the Resident Evil franchise is its trademark monsters, in which case this feature film does not fail to resurrect some of the most notorious creatures from the more classic games of the series. That does not go to say that they have done away with the new, either. With an interesting blending of creatures, Damnation takes that next step into the future of Resident Evil, teasing you with what is to come a few weeks down the line with Resident Evil 6.<br /><br />The plot at first may seem difficult to follow, but with Leon Scott Kennedy holding the reigns and Ada Wong throwing him a bone here and there, the story definitely does not disappoint. Between all of the monsters, fighting, and oh yeah... more monsters... You really appreciate the effort that was placed in the finer details that truly connect this movie with the rest of the series. Whereas Degeneration felt slightly more disjointed, Damnation is much better woven into the framework of the global threat of Bio-Terror looming on the horizon. The world really is turning into a mess and it's only a matter of time before it spins horribly out of control. This gives the film the intricacies and polish that its predecessor was lacking.<br /><br />If you're new to the series, the gore and rather flavorful action scenes may be enough to hook you. However, for loyal fans this is a breath of fresh air and you will feel entrenched in Leon's cause and perplexed by all of the questions the ending scenes present.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this ap but I hate that it sometimes freezes up on my kindle fire. I really think I need a pintervention so that I can stop pinning and actually do some of the projects that I've pinned.

0375842209|5.0|I've read a great deal of Holocaust literaure; I even took a graduate-level class in Holocaust literature. That said, this is still the best Holocaust book I've read since Elie Wiesel's [[ASIN:0374500010 Night]], which I read more than 30 years ago. Actually, this is the best book I've read in a long time.<br /><br />The book -- for the most part -- details the day-to-day existence in a small Bavarian village near Munich of a foster child, Liesel Meminger, the eponymous book thief; her best friend, Rudy Steiner; and her loving foster family, the Hubermanns. Narrated by Death himself, the language in the novel is oftentimes poetically existential:<br /><br />\\"...THE COLORS...<br />RED, WHITE, BLACK:<br /><br />\\"They fall on top of each other, the scribbled signature black, onto the blinding global white, onto the thick soupy red.<br /><br />\\"Yes, often, I am reminded of her [Liesel], and in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell. It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt -- an immense leap of an attempt -- to prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.\\"<br /><br />At other times, the irony is knee-deep, as in when Death explains the Third Reich in Chapter 9:<br /><br />\\"In a way, it was destiny.<br /><br />\\"You see, people may tell you that Nazi Germany was built on anti-Semitism, a somewhat overzealous leader, and a nation of hate-fed bigots, but it would all have come to nothing had the Germans not loved one particular activity:<br /><br />\\"To burn.<br /><br />\\"The Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, houses, personal items, slain people, and of course, books. They enjoyed a good book-burning, all right....\\"<br /><br />The Book Thief remains a page-turner throughout, never descending to preachiness or cheap sentimentality. Indeed, at 540 pages, the book still seems to end too soon. The Book Thief truly is destined to become a classic. I expect the novel to be added to the AP Literature recommended list -- it's that good. Don't miss out on this book.ct the novel to be added to the AP Literature recommended list -- it's that good.

0345536886|5.0|John Grisham never ceases to amaze me.  I never imagined that a hot shot lawyer could snap as did David Zinc.<br />The story kept me turning the pages again and again.<br />It started to remind me of his King of Torts, but smack in the middle of the story the plot twist, took me down an unexpected road.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|Too many contrived coincidences left me uncaring by the time the mystery was finally resolved.  The weirdness of Linus was never sufficiently explained (a short leg? Really?) and seemed somewhat unnecessary to the plot.  However, the storyline moved along and there were a few interesting twists. By taking note of the date at the start of each chapter, it becomes fairly easy to keep track of the time jumps. Usually the revelations from the past correspond to discoveries in the present. This would make a good vacation read.
030758836X|1.0|This has to be the worst book I've read in years.<br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />I simply can't understand how a female author can write about a woman FAKING rape. This book is disgusting, with no sympathetic characters and the worst ending.  Totally unbelievable. Just because it's a NYT best seller does not mean it's worth reading. Spare yourself.  I wish I had been warned.

0060825456|4.0|The story was cute, funny and yet so mysterious and spooky. Coraline is a bit annoying in the beginning, but it's totally understandable, I mean, I remember being a pain in the a$$ when I was a kid and didn't have anything to do during my summer vacations, and especially if I didn't have at least a couple of cousins to play with - so yes, it's kind of Coraline's right to harass her parents for something to do.<br /><br />The alternative reality in this story is quite creepy, the buttons in the eyes freaked me out so much that I don't know how Coraline managed to keep it cool, and I really liked how she beats the villain - clever, clever girl. ;)<br /><br />The illustrations are really beautiful, and my only wish is that I knew how to draw like that. *dreamy eyes*

B008ER9QKG|1.0|Maybe it ties for worst, the compeditor being the latest Traviata from the Met.<br />Both productions disconnect the visual from the musical and emotional.  The staging in the case of the Ring adds nothing to the understqanding of the drama, but rather serves as a distraction.<br />If this were a CD set, the souundtrack would be worth having, although Terfel would not be my choice for Wotan.<br />To contrast this staging with another with minimal background, watch the DVD of Die Walkure by Simon Rattle.  The backgrounds are so bare this might as well be a concert performance, but the direction is superb and the emotional intensity of the singers blazes from the screen. One forgets the backround and is swept by the music and actin.<br />Westbrook is the Seiglinde in both versions, but In the Rattle Walkure her passion burns up the stage. In the Met performance, she is barely acting.<br />I think that the problems encountered by the staging and poor direction affect the singers negatively, and  distract them rom the drama.<br />I have been a supporter of the Met, but if this is the dirction they are taking, I will no longer cont;inue.
B007UW9WOQ|4.0|As a non-cooker (microwaving is not cooking - right!) I did find the art of preparation and tasting interesting but one thing I could not figure out was why the eater of the nearly palm sized Nigirizushi would eat the entire piece in one gulp? It seems to me that like, let's say a fine gourmet chocolate, that one should eat small bites to savor the experience longer and not overwhelm it. Answers welcomed.<br /><br />As far as the movie script and directing I would have liked to have heard from the customers, especially international, post meal. Also would have liked to have learned from the vendor suppliers the discerning qualities that make a particular food source so special.  The personal stories about the family were nicely integrated with the food preparation part. The movie also adds more clarity as to why Japanese culture embodies fine & detailed workmanship.

0345803485|1.0|WHY is this book a Bestseller? If there was an option to give this title ZERO stars, I would have gone for that. Really, I'm halfway through the second book and I'm so bored I don't think I can continue. It's been torture getting this far. If this series has a plot, I have yet to figure out what it is. My home library is enormous and this has got to be the lamest book on my shelf. Knowing nothing of the author, I would guess she's a barely out of her teens, likes cheap wine and cheap fantasy... oh yeah, and she's probably a virgin with internet access.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this series is that I hate the characters and it's completely unrealistic. Let's start with Christian Grey. Supposedly he \\"earns\\" $100,000 an hour but he never seems to be working. All of his time is spent having sex or emailing Ana. He's 26, a self made billionaire, most beautiful man in Seattle, speaks fluent French, can pilot his own planes and helicopters, plays amazing piano and is supposedly the world's best lover, \\"ready to go\\" three times at one session. Yep, sounds like some teenage girl's \\"perfect man.\\" Oh yeah, except he's moody and insanely jealous. And he likes spanking and bondage so that must mean he's a pervert.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele...? Typical jealous female. I'm so bored with her drama I want to choke her. Every other paragraph she's blushing or biting her lip or saying \\"Oh jeeze\\" or \\"holy f***\\" because she can't believe how perfectly amazing he is. She's a virgin at the start of the series, but somehow he brings out her \\"inner goddess\\" and she orgasms on command, always these mind blowing climaxes. (And if she mentions her inner goddess one more time, I might puke.)<br /><br />The whole series so far is pointless banter and lame sex. As far as erotica goes, it doesn't even get my panties wet. Besides the fact that Christian seems ready to go at the drop of a hat a dozen times a day (completely unrealistic), he's a minute man. The sex has barely begun and they're both collapsing into simultaneous mind numbing orgasms. With as taken as he seems to be by the boring virgin Ana, it almost seems like his 15+ other subs must have been blow up dolls. The sex is NOT that graphic at all, it's barely even soft porn. (Ana constantly refers to her lady bits as \\"down there.\\") It's incredibly repetitive and 20 pages into the first book I was thinking, \\"Didn't I already read this part?\\" Their breath hitches all the time, they're always gasping and making the same stupid facial expressions on every page.<br /><br />I don't care what happens to either one of these characters. Actually, I hope the helicopter crashes and they both suffer horrible burns. Let's see if they still love each other then. THAT might be an interesting plot twist.

B006NYQAJM|3.0|My son saved his money to purchase this lego funhouse and was a little let down by the small size. The pictures of course are a bit deceiving.<br />Other than that it took him about an hour to put it together.<br />It would be a much better value at 1/2 the price or less.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This is easily the best Dylan album of the last decade.  It all started with his resurgence on Time out of Mind.  That was a great album but about four of the songs I always skip.  Love and Theft was even better followed by my personal favorite Modern Times.  They Dylan did a quick detour with a lackluster Together Through Life.  For some reason this album never grabbed me and I think others would agree.  If this were to be Dylan's last album (and I hope it's not) he went out way on top.  From the creative Dylan word play to the variety of topics he covers.  Lost love, sinking of the Titanic, and a a tribute to John Lennon this album has it all!  Dylan's voice is in great form and quite enjoyable.  His ravaged voice fits his music and dark lyrics extremely well.  As they used to say in the 60's nobody sing Dylan like Dylan!  I highly recommend this album as there is not a song on it I don't like.  I give it five stars and would give it more if possible to equalize out the uneducated morons giving it one star with a one sentence review.  The title track, Tempest, is a 14 minute 45 verse marvel depicting the chilling events of the Titanic sinking.  Dylan's word makes the scene easy to even visualize.  I highly recommend this album and I hope you enjoy it as much as me.

B002WNC5BU|4.0|I enjoyed this, mainly for the insight into the musical creative process and the different approaches taken by each of these musicians.  Watching and listening to them discuss this process was fascinating, and really opens up their music a bit.  I wish there was more footage of the three of them together, as that interaction was the highlight of the film for me, though watching Jimmy Page air jam to Link Wray's Rumble was certainly a magic moment.  This film makes for some nice entertainment for fans of these musicians.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A Discovery of Witches<br />All Souls Trilogy Book One<br />By Deborah Harkness<br /><br />Diana has spent her entire life denying herself anything to do with witchcraft, though she is descended from a long line of witches. When she was a child her parents were killed and she knew that it was because their deaths had, had something to do with magic. Now Diana is a historian focusing on alchemical texts, when she pulls stumbles upon an enchanted book within Oxford's Bodleian Library she is soon pulled into more magic than she had ever imagined.  With the help of vampire geneticist, Mathew Clairmont, Diana must survive witches who want her to recall the manuscript at any cost and she will soon realize that she is not quite as inept in witchcraft as she had previously thought.<br /><br />First and foremost this is a romance novel; I say this because the synopsis you read on the book or even on goodreads make it seem as it will be more of a novel like a Game of Thrones with only slight romance, and this is not the case. I don't have a problem with romance it was just not what I had expected when I started reading it. Most of the novel is rather slow; it's more of a building of the story and the characters than having a story of its own but when you get towards the end the author truly sucks you into the story. It is a well written novel and the world that Deborah Harkness has created in which there are four types of beings, Vampires Witches, Demons, and Humans, is truly fascinating. Demons are eccentric and focus more on the arts as Vampires focus more on science in their lives, now I know the Vampire aspect is not quite original but to take that theory and use it with demons is truly interesting. All in all this is an amazing start to a trilogy and worth it if you don't mind the slow start.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is more about faith than it is about \\"Bang, Bang, Shoot 'em Up\\":  Faith in God, Faith in Country, Faith in Training, Faith in Comrades, Faith in the Common Man.  The biggest lesson I learned from the book is that there are heroes where you don't expect them.  I am a Christian;  but I came away with the feeling that there are some life lessons to be learned from the Muslim faith.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best trilogy I have ever read.  They are so good I am rereading them just a week after finishing them.

145162607X|4.0|I always enjoy Phillippa Gregory's books and the same is true of The Kingmaker's Daughter.  I was very familiar with the story of Anne Neville,  partially because Gregory herself has written so much about this family.  As a result, this book didn't seem to contain much suspense or many surprises. Still, it was interesting to think of that time in English history, and the events, from Anne's perspective.
0385344333|1.0|I have been a Lee Child fan since his first novel the Killing Floor. I have all his novels and buy them when they first come out and wait patiently until the next. I have recommended him to many of my friends and share my copies frequently. The Wanted Man was by far the most disappointing Reacher novel the Lee Child has put out. I trust this was just a one time lackluster offering and I will await his next release.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I have the galaxy 2, and kindle fire, and the game plays great on both devices.  While I can see how people would be disappointed that the game doesn't play on their particular device, it doesn't seem fair to give the game a 1 star rating, since they can't really rate the game at all.
B0087HT36U|1.0|the game won't load on the galaxy nexus.  the one device every app should work on as its pure android.  way to go!  the game force closes before anything at all loads up.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its a fun game except for the fact that it requires for you to buy glue credits when you get far in the game. Otherwise its a fun game
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Its nice to know where all your energy is going and how much time you have before it dies and stuff.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|wish it was not so expensive.  but good game.  I like the building and food gathering.  it would be nice to be able to do more without money.

B00005JMJG|5.0|The local video store did not have this in circulation, so I checked here and found it at a good price.  The movie is a good thinking persons movie and it's nice to catch all the small things that go on in the movie.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|They needed to put in more special effects (which were well done, though few and far between), and less, poorly written,and sadly acted convoluted story-line.  Kristen Stewart had the same stoned look on her face through the entire movie.  Also, on what planet is Kristen Stewart more beautiful than Charlize Theron in any context?  As if! Charlize Theron gave the best performance, but not nearly at the level of her other work, and her accent was most annoying.  Other than a few interesting special effects, this movie is a total dog.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It leaks! That's all I can say. I know other people had great experiences, but maybe I just got a defective model. So, it leaked and Amazon took it back and I don't want another one!
B00005JK8K|2.0|this is a noisy & ghoulish war film with a sidebar on the Navajo Code Talkers - while two Navajo are frequently on the screen - code talking barely is - and in one of the climactic moments - English is all that is required<br /><br />someone took the old story of a guilt-ridden solder - and copy-n-pasted the code talkers into it - then added plenty of politically correct rhetoric - and set it loose on the paying public<br /><br />the code talkers deserved something that focused on them - and less on some soldier whose story is separate from theirs<br /><br />based on this film - i don't know why the Americans didn't just walk to Japan - they hit every enemy soldier they shot at - but the Japanese could only splatter the ground with bullets
0143119680|2.0|I am a techinical reader who likes to pause and take it all in and figure things out before moving on.  This book lost me several times.  I have to say that from the first chapter, I was confused.  I wish the auther picks a better subject than alchemy to base it on.  Being from Massachusetts, I did like the reference to Salem here and there, and I did like the European mood mid way through the book; but other than than that it bored me.  I often felt like I missed something and should have paid more attenention in the beginning.  The parts where magic and whitchcraft were used made me feel like that they were put there in case a movie was ever made out of this book which I wouldn't pay to go see if there was.  Then there was the issue of family memebers..I had a hard time keeping up with who was a biological parent, vampire parent, or both.  The Halloween references in the end were cute..big deal.  The romance seem to come out of nowhere too.  She was annoyed by Matthew and then all of a sudden in love with him, when did this happen?  I'd give this book a big \\"eh\\"

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is the best in the Harry Hole series; recommended for its intricate plot and well-drawn characters. For once Harry isn't staggeringly drunk, which goes a long way to pulling the reader into his investigation. As always, there are tantalizing clues planted for the reader as well as Harry, and the style is swift and engrossing. As good as the best of Ian Rankin.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator to just have on hand. Easy to use. Large buttons, easy to see. Necessary app for a tablet.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I absolutely love Supernatural. Its one of the most amazing shows I've ever watched and it gets better and better each season.
098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond has done a brilliant job of sharing his wealth of information to fellow aspiring Caricaturists & Cartoonists.<br />The book is copiously crammed with \\"how to\\" techniques for successful creation of caricatures.  I think it is one of the best<br />publications to come out in recent times.  The best handbook on Caricatures for every Caricaturist.<br />Tom is an exceptionally great Caricaturist.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As odd as it may sound, I have never read a book from cover to cover. I'm a young professional and I read all sorts of articles, manuals, magazines, etc. However, I've never read a book cover to cover. Strange, huh? It has nothing to do with illiteracy or anything like that. I just, simply, never had enough patience to read an entire book--not even for grade school. However, these short stories have kept me up until 3 AM the last week and I just found it so hard to put my iPad down. The author does a fantastic job of describing every detail needed to create the Silo in your mind. A fantastic read that is sure to keep you up late with your eyelids sinking yet your mind racing.<br /><br />The prequel, First Shift: Legacy, was also great. I read the Wool series first, then First Shift. I highly recommend reading them in this order, because as you read First Shift, you are asking yourself hundreds of questions, wanting more details because you've already read Wool.<br /><br />I cannot wait for more. I really hope more Wool stories are written and released, I'd be the first to buy them.

086571701X|4.0|I bought this book about 45 days ago. Since then school has started back up in full force and between raising children of my own, working a full time job, and taking 14 hours of mid-level biology classes I haven't had the time to finish reading this book. What little bit I have read seems informative. I am a biology major currently enrolled in botany and thus will be able to give this book a thorough review at the end of the semester. This is the reason for only four stars at the moment. It is subject to change.
B008MEM24S|4.0|the game it self is very fun but I think they ask to rate it to soon at least wait until after the 1st week
B0087HT36U|4.0|on my kindle fire it works great. made it through first few stages a love it. graphics are good could be better. but well worth the price. will look for future games from these people.
B005SYLKT8|2.0|This album was recommended to me. I would not have purchased and still not fully sold on it. I like maybe 3 songs. A little depressing for me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well, I was not expecting that. I read this because I wanted to have read the book before seeing the movie, and really didn't think any more of it. I was not expecting to love this book as much as I did. Comedy tinged with tragedy is just about my favorite thing ever, and it's so hard to get right, to really make the reader laugh and cry in turn, but Quick absolutely did the job. I love these characters so much: Pat with his childlike, hopeless optimism, the misguided, messed-up Tiffany, the awesome therapist Cliff.<br /><br />The movie is supposedly only \\"loosely\\" based on the book, and I have to say I'm glad it won't be trying to replicate exactly what made this read so engrossing and lovely. That bar's set pretty high.
B00004RF9B|1.0|If you were born during the 70's or after, just skip this movie. If you are a post-Star Wars sci-fi fan, don't bother going back in time just to watch this movie. This movie is outdated. My high school Calculus teacher forced my entire class to watch this movie and write about it. Sorry younger folks, there is nothing special about this movie. It is incredibly boring. The dialogue is cheesy. The special effects suck. I know my review is harsh, but we are just not acquainted with these dated sci-fi flicks. The only people who like this movie are old. If you try to criticize the movie, they can't seem to allow any other opinion to exist other than theirs. They can try to defend it all they want, but it's no use trying to argue with them.<br />Sorry folks but the movie really sucks. You can't get younger folks to like this movie no matter how hard you try. Not saying that younger folks are better than older folks. It's just not our cup of tea. I'll admit that I'm a young girl who loves sci-fi which is incredibly rare in my demographic. I've seen War of the Worlds (the original is the best), Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Star Wars, Star Trek, The X-Files, Independence Day, Armageddon, I Robot (which is excellent), Cowboys and Aliens, and both \\"V\\" TV series.  Most girls my age would rather watch Twilight over sci-fi anyway. I'm just giving my honest opinion.

B000K4X5XA|5.0|While Superman fans will have to wait a few more months before the new films hits the screens, I recommend watching the original film that brought Superman out of the comics and into movies. With some exceptions, most movies (like Michael Bay's Transformers series) offer style over substance and we get lots of eye candy and no story, the 1978 Superman film offers both, while the special effects are dated but it can still be enjoyed as a modern movie made to look retro, plus it is fun to see all the fashion and hear all the slang from the 1970s.<br /><br />Major spoiler (this movie has been out for years but if you haven't seen it..beware) the best part of the film is towards the end, Superman (Christopher Reeve) escapes capture from Lex Luthor and flies to stop the two missiles he launch in an attempt to destroy the west coast of California. Superman stops the first missile but the second hits the San Andreas fault line and Superman rushes to save the day, he repairs the fault line, saves children and prevents a mass flooding and after all his efforts, he senses something else wrong and scouts the area to find his lady love, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) dead, her car crushed and she suffocated after she was buried under rubble. Superman gently removes her from the car and after a moment of silence, he breaks down in anguish and flies up towards the sky.<br /><br />Here is the most powerful scene, up in the sky he confronted by the memories of both of his fathers, Jor-El, his biological dad, chastises him that it is forbidden for him to interfere in human history. Jonathan Kent, Clark's adoptive father, a man who raised him, protected him and taught him the values of life on Earth reminds his son that he was brought to Earth for a reason and finally, Superman remembered his own limitations, despite all his abilities and powers, he couldn't save his adoptive father (Jonathan Kent died of a heart attack) and followed his heart, Superman bends the laws of space and time, turns back the clock long enough for him to save everybody from the devastation of Luthor's attack and humbly returns to look upon a now alive Lois in her car.<br /><br />When was the last time you seen a movie, any movie, that captured so much emotion with a few scenes, no loud noises or eye popping special effects...just pure story. Check it out for yourself.urns back the clock long enough for him to save everybody from the devastation of Luthor's attack and humbly returns to look upon a now alive Lois in her car.<br /><br />When was the last time you seen a movie, any movie, that captured so much emotion with a few scenes, no loud noises or eye popping special effects...just pure story.

Following several weeks of daily use in my vehicle, it now -- occasionally -- starts playing gibberish.  The signal becomes distorted and all that comes through is painful, electronic nonsense. Later it will work fine, but I'm obviously going to need a new one.  Disappointing, because another CableJive cable I purchased (different connectors) is a much heavier gauge. I thought this one would be similar.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|K, you asked that I write a review if I liked or didn't like the book.  What I want to know is if this is just outside atlanta is it north or south, because the watertable I had a hard time figuring.  Not that I am criticizing but just curious if you researched or just pulled this at random.  I would recomend that anyone read first shift first, although I did not and it was kinda fun wondering through the whole wool omnibus WTFH.  If you are like me, then wait and read it last.  I do have to give you crazy high marks for thinking this through.  You must have one heck of an outline.  I can almost always find a few flaws in nearly every book but the water table was the only question I had in this one.  This was one of the cheaper books I have gotten (pages per penny cost) and also one of the better ones.  I really liked the psychological twists, the whole group mentality under confinement and what people are likely to do.  FANTASTIC

0754544052|5.0|ATTENTION TAX LAWYERS, EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS! `TOLLEY'S EMPLOYMENT TAX PLANNING' IS NOW AVAILABLE IN A NEW 2nd EDITION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Recently published by LexisNexis, Amanda Sullivan's excellent new edition of Tolley's Employment Tax Planning has become an indispensable reference for employment lawyers, tax advisers, or indeed anyone involved in employment tax planning.<br /><br />In one handy paperback volume of over 800 pages, Sullivan and her colleague, Graham Farquhar, provide a one-stop guide to the income tax and NIC matters pertaining to employment income, together with all the relevant compliance issues.  One ultra-convenient aspect is that it is cross-referenced to HMRCs internal manuals.<br /><br />Not only does this new second edition cover the basic legislation, it also contains much new material, including charges on employment income and the regular changes that have affected it in recent years in response to government policy, notably increased charges on company cars-- and tax incentives to encourage `greener' transport.<br /><br />Other new material includes and expounds upon the changes wrought by the 2011 Finance Act with respect to employee pension provision and the rules on third party remuneration and non-domiciled individuals.<br /><br />Speaking of which, do note that, from April 2013, there will be two significant new developments: one, a statutory residence test, replacing the current rules, which will decide the status of an employee with respect to such matters as factual presence in the UK and specific work activities.  The second is Real Time Information (RTI) which will affect the operation of PAYE.<br /><br />Especially important for the busy practitioner, the book is easily navigable and designed to make it easier to look up information.  There is a detailed contents list at the front plus, as you would expect, extensive tables of statutes and cases, as well as abbreviations and references.<br /><br />With all this, plus the 35 page index at the back, there are no less than eight appendices, including forms and reference tables, plus additional material such as a guide to income tax and NI contributions charges... advisory fuel rates... HMRC compliance checks... a Compliance Dates Diary... and more.<br /><br />Positively intriguing (apropos the often complex issue of self-employment) is the HMRC list of behind-the-camera jobs, from animal trainer to writer, the latter of which - wouldn't you know -- doesn't include reporters.<br /><br />If you're an employment law practitioner, or tax specialist, this book is definitely the one resource you cannot conceivably do without.of statutes and cases, as well as abbreviations and references.<br /><br />With all this, plus the 35 page index at the back, there are no less than eight appendices, including forms and reference tables, plus additional material such as a guide to income tax and NI contributions charges... advisory fuel rates...

B000ID37KO|4.0|The picture quality on this version is excellent! The last time I saw this, it was in VHS format and not a very good copy. The improved picture really brought out the beauty of Northern California.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|If the twilight series was poorly-written with poorly developed characters and twisted sex scenes...it would be called 50 shades. This series is a total rip -off of the popular vampire saga. Plot, archetypes, characterization and even dialogue are almost completely plagiarized...I can't believe it's on the best seller list
0385344333|2.0|I have been a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. That's for darn sure.<br />I was disappointed in this latest novel. Reacher inadvertently hitches a ride with two killers and a hostage. They give cover stories, and by each mile, Reacher finds something's wrong with this set-up.<br />What did it for me, aside from the dragging out plot, agents not their usual efficiency, not as much action as your regular Reacher novel, was a detailed description of Jack Reacher.<br />Don't get me wrong! I know what he looks like: 6'5\\", big frame, hands as big as plates, etc.<br />I always pictured him looking like the ex-football player, Howie Long--on Fox's Sunday pre-game show.<br />What made me upset was that description---and comparing 6'5\\" Jack Reacher to Tom Cruise's 5'6\\" frame.. Ok give or a few inches.<br />I know the studios paid Child big bucks for the rights, and Cruise being paid big bucks for rights, but darn it, it's too much for a hard core Reacher fan.<br />The book was a disappointment, the film will be miniaturized; and a lot of Reacher fans don't like it--that's for damn sure.<br />Ellen George, author, and reviewer
B0087HT36U|1.0|Immediate force close on Xoom with Jelly Bean.  Can't even review the title screen for you I'm afraid.  Totally useless.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|One of the decisions you make when you write is what tool to use. For Kindle, I'd assumed I had to use either something that creating MOBI format manuscript, or postscript, and I wasn't looking forward to learning a new word processor. Lucky for me, Microsoft Word appears to be the preferred way of typesetting your book. Phew!<br /><br />This guide includes instructions on how to typeset your manuscript (e.g. when / why to use the 'Heading' fonts, how to insert pictures and diagrams, etc.) and other procedural information.<br /><br />It's a short book, easy to read, and does a great job explaining the mechanics of publishing on Kindle. And, it's FREE.<br /><br />If you're a writer, you should be at least thinking about Kindle direct publishing, and if you're doing that, you should read this book.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the three series books. 1st book best, 2nd book fair, 3rd book fair at best. The movie follows the 1st book fairly well. The movie reinforces the books comparison of the political leaders in Washington DC and the population of District One in \\"Panem\\". (Both are POLITICAL powers.) Those in Washington and those in District One produce nothing, and exist by taxing the citizens of the other Districts (States).  The book and the movie show the political extreme we are traveling towards.<br />  I read the book's description of the residents in District One, detailing their extreme bad taste, and being extroverted with ego-centric and narcissistic personality disorders.  In the movie, inside the large hall and seeing the District One people watching the \\"Games\\" I was reminded of the \\"Hollywood Crowd\\" watching one of their many Award Shows honoring themselves.<br />  Movie was good but book was better. Movie properly avoided gratuitous sex and minimized the violence as much as they could with the story's subject.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Disappointing. A little too much sat nav driving for my liking. The plot is a bit for fetched and complicated. I have read all of the jack reacher books. In my opinion this is the weakest most contrived. I began to lose interest half way through. I doubt if I will bother reading another one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A great read about a difficult genius.  I could not put it down.  Isaacson has great material but he also makes the most of it.
B007SGM084|4.0|Haven't made it through the last book yet, but so far the characters keep you entertained. Looking forward to finding out what happens in the last book.
0375850864|5.0|I am an adult and I LOVED this book! My best friend is a 4th grade teacher and recommended it, saying you don't have to be a child or young adult to appreciate it. She was so right!  I re-read A Wrinkle in Time in preparation for this book, which is probably a good idea since you need some familarity with that. Anyway, this is a WONDERFUL choice for young AND regular adults!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I just finished watching all 14 episodes of Firefly and tonight I watched Serenity. Yes there is a lot of situations that could have happened to Han Solo, but George Lucas never brought them to the screen, so here it is Firefly and Serenity. And thank you, thank you thank you! I'm a big fan of westerns (Hell on Wheels, Lonesome Dove), SCIFI (Walking Dead, Sarah Connor Chronicles, Star Wars), this is all that and more. I can understand people watching Serenity alone not connecting with it, they needed to see Firefly first to familiarize with the characters and the story. I loved it and wished more Firefly seasons had been done.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|This app isn't good at ALL! Whoever says they like this means that one of there friends liked it and they wanted to be like them. If you want a good app, get naked wing.
B0087HT36U|5.0|the best thing about this app would be that when you play you get to see the whole field not just part of it but overall a great game that you should get.
B0071AGIBM|5.0|This full length recording is a must have as it puts the Kingdom of the Shades in perspective.  Natalia Makarova's version of the ballet for American Ballet Theatre and the Royal Ballet is my favorite, as she created the last act which has been lost/forgot for reasons I don't know.  Rudolf Nureyev's version for the Paris Opera Ballet doesn't have one, nor does the Maryinsky Ballet, unless this has changed since the video came out many years ago.  I cannot recommend this recording highly enough.
B0087HT36U|2.0|This game *does* work on Kindle Fire and deserves 2 stars for it. But it looks and feels like Angry Birds but I am not keeping it on my Kindle fire due to excessive advertising modules that found in the game. The other social gaming module being the dreaded \\"OpenFient\\". I need not have to repeat about OpenFient here on this Amazon community over and over again - Bottom-line is that is not needed for this single player game and it is there to mine data off your device. - Just a friendly warning!<br /><br />Details of modules seen:<br />Advertising: AdMob, Millenial, MoPub, TapJoy<br />Analytics: Flurry, Google Analytics<br />Social Gaming: OpenFient<br /><br />Permissions: Android.Internet, View Network State etc;<br /><br />The game otherwise is more or less like [[ASIN:B007TLOYZU Fragger]]
B005LAIGLE|3.0|Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is an ex-smuggler who works installing security alarms and lives a peaceful life with his wife, Kate (Kate Beckinsale), and their two sons in New Orleans. One day, Chris and Kate learn that her brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) was smuggling drugs, but was forced to drop them into the Mississippi River in order to avoid arrest during a surprise inspection by U.S. Customs. Andy's boss, ruthless mobster Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), is infuriated and demands repayment.<br />The plot was good and the acting wasn't bad but there were too many slow parts for an action/thriller, although it does get more intense towards the end. They went to the extreme with language just to get an R rating, if they reduced the language a bit than it could easily be PG-13. Contraband isn't a must see but it's a step above average and keeps your interest throughout.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is  great game for anyone who likes a challenge. Its not incredibly hard but its not also incredibly easy.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Back in July of 1990, Pantera released their major label debut and it was an instant classic along with their later discography that kept metal alive throughout the '90s. Cowboys From Hell was a bit different and a change for the better. They started as a hair/glam metal band but after the late '80s they got a bit heavier and incorporated power, thrash, speed and groove metal into their music. Although it takes until their follow up Vulgar Display Of Power to really break into the mainstream, Cowboys From Hell and Cemetery Gates are still popular songs today. Primal Concrete Sledge, Medicine Man, Heresy and Domination are my highlights of the album and some of the best moments in metal.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|I cannot for the life of me understand how some people can say that this is the best book they've ever read!!! Some of my thoughts while reading were...silly, stupid, why did I purchase this. I feel that many of the people who gave this a 5 star rating must be under 18 years of age.  This series is very young and as an avid reader I feel cheated because of all the great reviews....Slammed is NOT for adults who want a enjoyable read..
0425263908|2.0|I bought this book based on the reviews that if you liked 50 Shades, you would like this book. Not so much. If you read 50 Shades, this book is a re-write with different characters. The author even thanks E.L. James for paving the way. This book shows no creativity. There are so many similarities to 50 shades that I find myself rolling my eyes wondering where this author got that idea.  I feel like the author basically copied 50 shades but changed the characters names to make it her own and added a gay character instead of \\"Kate\\".  I would have enjoyed reading 50 Shades again instead of this book. I even find myself putting the book down and not reading it for weeks at a time and then picking it up when I have nothing else to do, because I feel like I have already read the book and don't need to know what's going to happen next. With 50 Shades, I couldn't put the book down. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />If you haven't read 50 Shades yet, then you will probably enjoy this book, however 50 Shades leaves you wanting more and wondering what is going to happen. This book just lacks IMO.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|ok so I downloaded this app for my kindle fire and now its telling me that I cant watch annything on it....I think the Pearson that made this app should go in and make it better
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|i thought it was excellent, it had great acting, awesome special effects, and the queen was completely and utterly perfect, i just watched it and am going to restart and watch it again, i thought it was a very dark and seductive remake of snow white that really had style
B008KRJWEK|5.0|a really very great game, runs great on kindle fire . its kinda hard to get good cars. somtimes the gyro gets mest up but its a 5 star game
B0087HT36U|1.0|Game does not run on my Samsung Galaxy Nuxus. running CM10 ROM. that is all. ya. filler. more and more.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I wanted to read this book to see what all the hype was about this series. I was very skeptical but choose to read it anyway. I must say after reading a lot of reviews I didn't think I would like it. And I have to say I was extremely surprised at how much I really enjoyed it. I will say that I was disappointed at how everyone says how \\"dirty\\" these books are but comparing to some of the others I have read they are pretty mild in some aspects. Well worth the read I believe but you can tell that she is new to writing. Overall I would and have recommended this book & series to friends and family alike.
B0087HT36U|5.0|the levels are really fun and creative and sometimes challenging. I like that there are so many levels in the worlds.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This is a great show and I love having all the seasons at my fingertips.  My family and I watch them over and over again. Great fun!
B00007KWHP|5.0|Just having the full-length version of America makes this CD worthwhile.  I haven't heard it in years, and it's great to be able to hear it once again.  But the enire CD sounds great. I find myself playing it over and over.  Also noteworthy is the alternate version of Roundabout.  It's mostly the same as the final cut but has some distinct differences that I think compares favorably with the final cut.
B0087HT36U|1.0|I tried installing it on my jelly bean Galaxy Note but it force closes immediately. I'd love to try it but I guess it is no fun if it doesn't work.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The movie had action and a little suspense. It had good graphics and held the interest of my 15 and 18 year old. There was a little cussing in it but overall not bad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it. its the best thing ever I just love it soooooo much. I cant wait to use it all the time
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I am thrilled with my purchase of the cd Phantom of the Opera.  It was filmed in the beautiful venue  of Royal Albert Hall.  It was like I was right there watching it.  BRAVO! BRAVO!
B004UID2LC|1.0|doesn't play songs on it for my kindle fire and I try to listen to it but it wont let me
B0087HT36U|5.0|this app is really cool... I started playing it and it was easy to learn! the gravity effect and graphics are pretty cool! ive always. e'en looking for a game like this that involves castles and catapults!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Way better without ads...plus more levels..makes it harder to put down..I been hooked on Angry Birds From Day One..And Still Crazy About It..
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app, no problem, beautiful clear pictures and simple controls. don't have any complaints at this point. wish I had this from the start.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is Truely amazing. I can not wait for the next world. I just hope that miniclip won't add ads.
0345803485|1.0|I usually dont take the time to write a review about anything.  I was excited to obtain this book due to all the hype going on.  Well, I was very disappointed. It is clear that the author is not a TRUE WRITER. The book did not flow, the characters and the story line is predictable.  Til this day i still can't visualize the characters. There is no suspense or curiosity as to what happens in the book.  The writing lacks conviction, does not grab you, does not keep you and does not entertain you.  It is just a PORNO book and nothing more!  I stopped at chapter 6 and gave the book away. I wish i could throw a book together, write nasty sex scenes, market the garbage and become a millionaire...  I don't know what the HYPE was all abouT
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just finished reading all three of the Fifty Shades books. Not because I wanted to, mind you, but because I stupidly bought the entire Kindle edition trilogy at once, without reading any reviews, and I'm obsessive-compulsive and once I start reading something, I'm inwardly compelled to finish it. I needed to know what all the hype was about, and now that I'm done, I still don't know. If the constant lip-biting and the tiresome references to Ana's ridiculous inner goddess weren't bad enough, the lack of any real plot put me over the edge, and my OCD had to force me to read the rest. Instead of being sexy and thrilling, the sex scenes became comical after about the third time in one session Christian would be ready for action. C'mon, ladies, am I right? Just not realistic! :-) I don't know what I was expecting, I guess the whole thing is supposed to be a giant fantasy, what with the self-made gazillionaire that never actually does any real work and the fancy sports cars and the servants and the helicopter rides and the private jet. I'm just disappointed, this wasn't the kind of fantasy I was hoping for.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The fisrt track, 'Hung Up', is fun to dance to and contains the sample of Abba's hit song 'Gimme Gimme, Gimme'.<br /><br />'Get Together' isn't bad and is very romantic, along with 'Future Lovers'.<br /><br />'Sorry' is another great song from the album and does a great job at expressing one's feelings towards their ex who never will change.<br /><br />'I Love New York' is a great song and goes out to all the New Yorks and those who love the city.<br /><br />'Let it Will Be' isn't bad either along with 'Jump' and 'Push'.<br /><br />'How High' is semi-autobiographical of the Material Girl herself and is get to dance to also.<br /><br />'Isaac' with its Middle Eastern influence is another beautiful song from the album.<br /><br />'Like it or Not' clearly makes reference to the story of Adam and Eve and about sin.<br /><br />Overall the album is great for dancing, and confessioning ones feelings about things.<br /><br />Another smash from the Material Girl indeed.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|It wasn't as good as I hope but it was still entertaining Charlize played a good witch and some of the special effects were good as well.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds, and now its even better without the pesky ads at the top of the screen.
0312600844|2.0|The book was delivered quickly and in good condition, but I didn't like this book all that much.  Freedom tells the story of a contemporary American family as they adapt to the things happening in our age.  I enjoyed the beginning of the book, but as it went on, the plot lost momentum.  Though there was a lot of character development, the characters were unlikable and the plot was only so so.  This was not a book where I loved the characters for their flaws but where, as I got closer to the end of the book, I found myself flipping through pages without reading them because I didn't care exactly what happened to those characters.  The conclusion of the story was disappointing, as it was sudden and resolved the story's conflicts without giving the story any real meaning.  Overall, this is not a book that I would read again or recommend to friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was nothing like I ever expected! It had me captured from the 1st chapter to the end! I wanted to have my own Christian Grey. Him and all his 50 shades:-)
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle fire.  TED is a collection of short lectures by experts in different fields.  I have been able to view lectures given by several of my heros in the arts and literature fields and learn about new ideas in science and technology that, otherwise, I would not have been exposed to.  The app works well -- good image on the screen, runs smoothly -- and, because it is on my kindle, I can carry it around the house with me while I clean or cook.  Highly recommended.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have waited a long time for this app!  I think it works great!  Looks good and havn't had any issues.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Ok so first the game crashed every time I opened it, then when I uninstalled it and thought if I tried to reinstall, it says it's still on my phone.... so now not only does the game mess up SO I AMAZON!!! I am very unhappy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is off the hook.  but they are right about all the people downloading it. also I hear for the next update they are coming out with. breeding and some other cool stuff. also they are including interman beware they teleport.
B008LB8EOY|5.0|I enjoyed all the songs, but especially \\"Chariots of Fire\\" in its new rendition. Some songs were tastefully quiet and peaceful, but others had a more majestic tone. I'm glad I made the purchase.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this app is amazing its better than city story and there divest points and city cash is a lot cheaper than city stories as well
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I am not a film critic. I usually don't bother writing reviews either, but upon seeing the movie I thought the amount of stars it had did not reflect the quality of the movie.<br />The cinematography was well done. Outside of the last castle raiding scene toward the end of the movie the overall good.<br />Charlize Theron was phenomenal in her role. I would have to say her role was done the best out of all of them. Snow white started off bland but Kristen Stewart grew into the part as the movie progressed. This was the first time for me watching Kristen Stewart in a role. Charlize Theron performance just made Kristen Stewart's performance seem lack luster, but it wasn't really that bad just not phenomenal.<br />The story itself was well written. For a short screen time it gave enough depth to the main characters to make the story worth watching. I especially like the depiction of the dwarfs.<br />I wonder if people thought this was going to be some nice Disney like Snow White. It is not. This is how a fairy tale used to be told pre-Disney.<br />If your looking for a darker depiction of the story Snow White I would recommend watching this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good idea and concept for a game glad I have it.  everyone should download it n play it.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Being pregnant I have wanted to watch pregnancy movies. I watched this the first night it was out for rental. Overall it was quirky and entertaining. The movie was filmed in a way that it didn't distract the view while watching. The acting was overall well done.<br />My only issue was that it did not cover any alternatives from the hospital birthing experience. The ending felt like a promotional for hospital births. For me it was a let down to see how the birth part of the different running stories was told. The part where the c-section was needed felt very flaky. As a medical professional I would want a patient that is empowered, so therefore one that ask, \\"Why do I need to have this done?\\" Just blindly accepting a treatment made it feel like the writers of the story just breezed over this part of the story.<br />I liked the actual acting part of the adoption process depicted in this movie. The acting was very touching.<br />Overall if your looking for a cute movie that gives your a few laughs this one is a good pick. It just felt lukewarm when I was expecting something funnier like the film Baby's Mama.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This novel combines everything you would expect from a Dan Brown, Tom Clancy, and the best novels of Europe, but with complexity of computer programming and the fierceness that the lead character embodies wonderfully blended in. I read this book in 4 days. One of my favorite novels that I keep coming back to reads again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and it got me to want to read the books. Which is saying a lot because I don't read books at all. They never grab my attention. This book did. If you like the movie. You'll love the book.
B008M34INW|1.0|It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it.  Way too much violence & drug use.  What happened to great movies like Lethal Weapon?
B0076NKNLA|1.0|Although Michelle portrayed her in a non campy way -- like many others have in the past, the film was a complete YAWN.  It just wouldnt move along and I almost stopped it half way through but I thought I better see how the end turned out ( Well we all know how the end turned out for the real Marilyn) I am talking about the movie silly LOL --- and I still give it a BIG YAWN!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I actually said I refused to buy this book series as I had no room for the books............THEN...........I happened to change tv channels in time for another show I was watching and ended up watching some of the tv series - of course after bout only 2 minutes I was addicted and looking up as to who had the books available to buy!!<br />The first 5 books in the series arrived and I'd finished the first 5 books before the end of the first season of the tv show so was stuck dying from impatience for the 2nd season & 6th book to be available and have re-read all 5 books while waiting!!<br />This is a series I'd recommend to anyone!!
B003H9MSPG|5.0|My 8 yr old, loves it, and I bought it for ME. LOL. He has a full collection of Nerf and this is his favorite, even before I added the Mod Kit (search for nerf mod kit on various retail sites to find them) now that it is modded and shoots 92 feet, he won't use anything else. One particularly nice feature is that the front barrel comes off easily and allows a smaller kid to use it easily. Strongly suggest buying extra clips at same time, the clip system is addicting. On the office war side, this is the one first grabbed out of the pile when available. For those into modding, the plastic used accepts model grade plastic paint easily and without smearing.  I strongly suggest starting with the FUSION spray [paint for plastic] after sanding if going for a custom look - I learned this the hardway...  Start dark to cover the bright colors then work your way to lighter ones, using several light coats.  There is also room for LEDS inside the case.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 is awesome (only 2 more episodes to go), but it has a much different feel than Season 1 and 2.  Not enough Mary and Matthew!  As an American, I am FURIOUS that it airs in September 2012 in UK but PBS doesn't air it until January 2013 in USA.  Why does PBS make us wait, and then for a chopped-up version?  I saw on Facebook and Google that you can easily click on links to watch it in America a few hours after it airs in the UK.  I've been watching every show online for free!!! Dan Stevens: please please please come back for Season 4!
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Absolutely extraordinary compilation of BBC productions on planet earth.<br />The Video: Some scenes or relatively long sequences do not have the absolute high definition 1080p, maybe the resolution is 1080i or 720, but the experience is absolutely brilliant, there are incredible shots made ​​with cinema technology.<br />The sound: is the best part. I have a home theater with 3D sound and the experience is amazing, the sequences in the sea, forests, rivers, etc. like we're in the middle of the shot, with the animals.<br />I absolutely recommend this collection to appreciate what little we have left the planet.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I so enjoyed reading the books. I had so many unanswered questions after watching the movie, and reading the book  answered them. I also like it on my kindle and downloading the kindle app to my iPhone made it convenient to read anywhere I happened to be. The kindle was the best gift I have ever received.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very easy to use. lt is easy to read and intuitive to operate. Does just what I need it to.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is magnificent. It is such an amazingly well written story. I can't believe I bought this for only $2.99!! This is 630 pages full of simply stunning story. I've fallen in love with Vaelin Al Sorna and all of his friends, Caenis, Barkus, Dentos, Nortah and even Frentis, as well as his hateful horse Spit and his dog Scratch. This book held me spellbound, I was there, I knew these people like I know my own self. I felt every pain, every happiness, every wound, I felt it all. And I was so damned mad when it ended lol because I want to read the next part NOW! Mr. Anthony Ryan, for a new writer in our midst, you are incredible. And you have earned a new fan for life. PLEASE HURRY WITH THE SECOND BOOK!!!! PRETTY PLEASE :)
B007V80WUC|5.0|This is the first offering from Circus Maximus that I had heard.  I was blown away.  I have been a Dream Theater fan from the beginning and thought I was listening to some past DT that I somehow hadn't heard before.  Don't get me wrong, this band is not a clone of DT, but the song construction, time shifts, and fantastic riffs and melodies model them very closely.  Highlights for me include \\"Burn After Reading\\", \\"I Am\\", and \\"Namaste\\".  There is not a weak song on this production and I would highly recommend this album to any fans of DT, or even Symphony X.  Pick this up, you'll be glad you did.
B0087HT36U|4.0|coool apply I like it a lot it is a lot of fun for me I thought it would be like angry birds but its not ;-)
B007TML4EI|5.0|Really hard parts, but it's one other decent games you rarely get, in face, even better then that!  If you want a good game to play, install this!
B0087HT36U|1.0|The fake reviews have to stop. Let the people decide what this should be rated at, not the devs and their associates. Hate this crap
B008XG1X18|3.0|it is a nice concentrated way to waste a little time online. I am not too adept at it but I am learning.
B0087HT36U|1.0|I agree completely with Thom Bone.  Bilking consumers out of real money when this is a paid game is totally unacceptable. There is simply no end to the level of Greed of some of these developers. I will remember Never to purchase anything from Miniclip.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Interesting story.  I enjoyed all of the family dynamics.  Engaging characters.  I bought this book on one of Amazon's daily deals.  I would like to read the second book but will wait until it comes down in price.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Pretty cool game, a lot like angry birds.  Price is right for the game, especially with this many levels.  Definitely one to recommend
B000YMFCS4|5.0|One of the best movies i  have had the pleasure of watching.  The actors couldnt have been better chosen for the parts they played. You really need to pay attention to the whole story so that you truly understand the ending, which was a real tear jerker but it was so well done that it really keeps you actually thinking  and dreaming that life could actually end that way if you have been in a relationship with a spouse that had lasted a lifetime.....which mine has and it was also filmed in beautiful locations in the southern lowcountry of sc, which of course is where our home is as well. I am homebound and watch dozens of movies everyday.... this is definately a five stars. Usually i end up watching mostly old movies, and the classics because they just arent making movies with a good storyline or any substance like they use to.<br />When i find a really great one, it gets watched alot!

B00899E5B4|4.0|This is a great album that sounds like it could have been released in the 1970s. It deserves more airplay than it probably DOESN'T get, even on rock stations.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game and so does my three year old. great time killer. kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss
B007L3BMGA|4.0|To be honest with you I didn't realise that the book was Erotica,,I don't usually read erotica books. Besides all the steamy sex, which was very often I ejoyed the reading I just thought it ended very abrupt,,,not in the way I would have liked. I wanted the Fairy Tale story book ending,,unless there is another sequel coming out to it!
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Absolutely love the music but note to engineer: 100% is not a goal on the gain... it's the maximum.  You don't have to hit it all of the time.  Stop it.  There's plenty of dynamic range to back off a little and not let the compression smash everything to within an inch of its life.  Believe it or not there's a knob on the front of my preamp that lets me make things louder; you don't have to do it for me.<br /><br />I prefer listining to this CD on my phone with cheap headphones than on a good sound system; it gets downright tiring and grating after a while.<br /><br />That rant over, probably one of my 10 favorite CDs.

B0000TG9E2|4.0|This is one in a series of posted reviews for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other \\"Alice\\" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!<br /><br />This general commentary continues as a posted review for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (this title) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp, as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather than attempt to add yet-another-review here, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse for a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with same title used throughout.<br /><br />To continue...<br />I claim to be neither a Lewis Carroll nor an Alice in Wonderland expert. Rather, I went into this project naive... ignorant of the details of the story of Alice in Wonderland... ignorant of the poems within the story, and certainly ignorant of the comings and goings in Lewis Carroll's life that set up the circumstances allowing him to imagine the story of Alice in Wonderland (originally entitled \\"Alice's Adventures Underground\\", by the way).<br /><br />Watching that 1951 Disney rendition of AIW was a remarkable experience. It was fun to \\"remember\\" the story of Alice again, but also, it left me with a desire to see how else the Alice story has been rendered. The Disney film is of course animation. So how would Alice in Wonderland be portrayed in other mediums? What I learned is that AIW has been rendered in about every way you can imagine. Most familiar of course is the telling of the Alice story in film, with live action, animation, and various combinations of both. In fact since the invention of film at the turn of the 20th century not a decade has gone where at least one (and usually several) fresh renderings of the Alice story been told in moving pictures.<br /><br />Beyond that however the Alice story has been told in many forms: audio recordings, plays, ballets, operas, and musicals. It's been done with the use of puppets and marionettes, with stop motion \\"Gumby style\\" animation, in games, in home-brew backyard productions posted to YouTube, and as an Alice in Wonderland theme park. There's even been an X rated version done as a musical (quite good). A number of established shows have done a take on the Alice story; The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Care Bears, Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, Barney, Scooby Doo, The Simpsons, Star Trek TOS, and even `Hello Kitty' took a shot at Alice.<br /><br />What's more, a wide variety of famous actors and celebrities have appeared in an Alice film. Stars from W.C. Fields to Cary Grant to Peter Sellers to Richard Burton... The Smothers Brothers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dudley Moore, Brooke Shields, Maryl Streep, Debbie Allen, Nathan Lane, Sammy Davis Jr., Ringo Starr, Terry Garr, and Whoopi Goldberg, just to name a few, have been involved in some sort of Alice production.<br /><br />And then there are the numerous Alice based endeavors, from Woody Allan's `Alice' with Mia Farrow, to Jefferson Airplane's `White Rabbit'.<br /><br />Why? Why is Lewis Carroll's story of a young girl who fell down a mythical rabbit hole so compelling? What gives the story such staying power? How is it that people of virtually all ages are so inexplicably drawn toward Alice and her land of wonders?<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />I've tried to steer clear of scholarly answers that address that question. There have been many attempts to do so. On the surface we can locate several plausible reasons that explain why Alice in Wonderland resonates with so many. We have a young, [seemingly] helpless girl. She's an underdog. Out of her element. A vulnerable character put in jeopardy. We ask, \\"what will happen next?\\", as the story takes one unexpected turn after another. And of course animals with human attributes in any story is compelling. Walt Disney discovered that innate attraction and made an industry of it. But do these answers get to the heart of the question?<br /><br />I happen to believe the explanation of Alice in Wonderland's universal appeal is that we, all of us, all human beings, young and old, have been to Wonderland ourselves. We go there in our dreams. We can all relate to the experience of logic and proportion falling away because it has happened to us. We understand how, in all the bizarreness of the wonderlands we fall into at night, that we rarely lose our heads. We should be really scared. Alice should be really scared. But somehow we accept what we see. Such is the worlds of dreams.<br /><br />Furthermore, how many of us have wondered if we continue to dream after we die? Are dreams what the afterlife is composed of? We don't fully understand the nature of dreams, so we contemplate upon them. Even the errant machine HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey asked if he would dream after he was turned off.<br /><br />And now to return to the original question I postulated. How did I somehow know the story of Alice in Wonderland without having a particular recollection of reading the book? Or seeing a movie? One answer of course is that pieces of the story just leaked into my consciousness over the years. A movie clip here. A verbal explanation there. But could there be a deeper reason? It may have to do with \\"archetype\\". It is certain that Alice in Wonderland acts as a metaphor for dreams, but the Alice Stories seems to delve deeper... into a primal archetype --a \\"template\\" if you will-- out of which human circumstances arise. Because of that we recognize Alice's dilemma in a deep and fundamental way.<br /><br />To write the story of Alice in Wonderland Lewis Carroll had in some way become conscious of the meta-physical world. The world beyond normal perception. A world that is, as Rod Serling put it, \\"beyond that which is known to man\\". Whereas visual artists such as Hieronymus Bosch reflected their visions of the other-world in paintings, Lewis Carroll's palette was paper and words. I would not be surprised if Carroll had at some point and in some fashion become \\"experienced\\", in a Jimmy Hendrix sort of way.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy every telling of the Alice story you can get your hands on. Each one is unique. It's fascinating to see how the core Alice story is manifested in different media. It's fun to see how the various animals are rendered. If you can, read the books first. If you can't, remember that anything to with a playing card motif, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Hearts, the stolen tarts, the Duchess, falling down the rabbit hole and the pool of tears, the White Rabbit, growing and shrinking, the Mad Hatter (and tea party), Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Mock Turtle, and the Gryphon, -phew- all come from Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />A motif based upon a chessboard, The Red King and Queen, the White King and Queen, the Red Knight and White Knight, the Jabberwocky, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, Hatta and Haighaa (a disguised appearance by the Mad Hatter and the March Hare), and the The Walrus and the Carpenter come from Through the Looking Glass.<br /><br />You'll find that many renderings of Alice in Wonderland combine elements of both books, and you know...<br /><br />Not everyone likes what's often been done<br />turning the story of Alice on ear<br />but I say, it's in spirit of fun<br />there's really nothing at all to fear<br /><br />so what if Walt Disney brought forth Tweedledum and Tweedl-dee<br />and introduced Alice to the Walrus and his carpenter bud-ee<br />and all those talking flowers!

B008Y1RTUG|3.0|If a movie is going to have the title of Snow White and the Huntsman, perhaps the investors should have invested in a Snow White that can do more than stand on an X and look unsure of herself.<br /><br />The title of the movie should have been \\"EVIL QUEEN: mein kampf\\", eh? eh? Sounds better right? Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen was an excellent choice. She is able to garner sympathy and show that at one time she herself was victim to another persons life-altering decision - was that her mother or neighborhood witch that initiated the curse? Honestly, I feel the movie would have been more interesting if it covered the history of the Queen and the numerous (20?) kings she overthrew. I feel that with all the cunning and intelligence that the Evil Queen had, surely, her agenda was greater than that of stealing women and taking their youth. With all the time she spent on earth, surely her persona, wisdom and goals were far greater than that. The manner in which she created a false army to appear as a beautfiul victim to seduce the King indicates how cunning she is. There is so much more with regards to direction that the industry can take with Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen.<br /><br />I once saw on a blog that in one of the earlier centuries, the word \\"nice\\" meant foolish or simpleton(?). Kristen Stewart, you look great, and apparently with her as the featured actress in this movie, the audience these days is expecting more than a pretty face who stands on a mark and appears \\"nice\\". At least I do. She needs to take acting lessons. What she got away with in Twilight stopped working here in this movie.  Hey, when you're at your jobs, you dont get better by people telling you how great you are and letting things slide. You dont get away on the job with your looks, its not the real world. I just feel as though someone who had more....live theater experience possibly, could have handled the part of Snow White better. Yes, Kristen Stewart is gorgeous and she has that certain something that makes you want to watch her, but sometimes, it just isnt enough.<br /><br />Overall, if you're interested in the Queen and watching Charlize Theron show the underlings what acting is all about, I recommend this movie. The 3 stars are for Charlize, because she carried it that far. Way to go Charlize!rtain something that makes you want to watch her, but sometimes, it just isnt enough.<br /><br />Overall, if you're interested in the Queen and watching Charlize Theron show the underlings what acting is all about, I recommend this movie. The 3 stars are for Charlize, because she carried it that far. Way to go Charlize!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another good book from lee child.  Jack reacher does what he does best, lee child does what he does,best and entertains.
B001C48EGK|5.0|I love DiCaprio's movies, but this one seems to be my most-watched movie.  I love that the disc came with an extra digital disc so that I can download it onto a computer and enjoy the movie when travelling with my laptop.<br /><br />Since viewing this movie, I have a different perspective on the Middle East, per se, in that I don't dread it as much.  Picked up some useful Arabic, to boot.  Also, I bought a couple of songs that were featured in the movie and love them.  Although the lyrics are in Arabic, they have a great beat for dancing or exercising (Kasbah Rockers).
B0087HT36U|3.0|It's interesting how \\"free\\" apps get chosen for AFAOTD that are free all the time in GP and they are less intrusive there. It's sort of like Amazon is allowing them to cash grab their \\"less tech savvy\\" customers who have the Kindles vs. a standard tablet that doesn't live in it's partitioned app-store world.

B0054SMID0|4.0|This caught my eye because I remember reading the Connelly book upon which it was based--one of his best.  The film does the author proud.  In fact, it's even better!  Not even 5 seconds are lost with Hollywood's annoying practice of slowing down so the viewer who already is into the action \\"gets it\\".
B0090P98Z4|4.0|So far a great game. Kind of sucks that you have to buy glu points to upgrade certain things but what can you expect from a free game. Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing!!! Right when the movie came out me and my bestfriend went to go see it at the Palace and had no idea what it was about. After the movie was over I hated it and I felt like I was gonna throw up because it was soo intense. The next few days I thought about the movie and started to kinda not hate it. Moday at school we had to go down to the book fair to look around. Me and my bestfriend saw the three hunger games books and I was like &#34;I cant believe they fit 3 hours of throw up into this small little book&#34;. That night I came back to the school and got all 3 books. I started reading them and LOVED them!<br />  ~AMANDA~
0345803485|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS GREAT.  COULD HARDLY WAIT TO READ BOOK TWO.  I HAD NOT READ IN AWHILE IN THIS WAS VERY ENTERTAINING.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Application works very well; I would give 5 stars if it provided the remaining battery power on sight (without having to select and start the full app).
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read all the books in this series and loved them all...until this one that is.  Time to get Jack out of the midwest empty fields and back to civilization.  Reacher also is starting to sound more like a hobo and less than a man not on a mission but visiting America at his leisure.  The premise is really getting old and stale.  Time for some new action or some kind of a new story line.  I don't think Tom Cruise will help the franchise any, by the way.  Six feet five inches tall... really??  I think he's 5 foot 6 inches or something.  His ex-wife had to duck down for their wedding pictures or be taller than him.  Come on Lee, you can write better than this.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|I first heard James Morrison on Pandora and loved the songs I heard.  I finally bought this CD and love it! Every song on it is great - great sound and even better lyrics.  I hope that he soon catches on faster here in the States-because otherwise we're the ones missing out.  I have since bought his other 2 CDs and like those very much too.  I totally recommend.  And I had the chance to see him in concert early this summer and it was a awesome show! I'm hooked.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|The Grey follows an oil drilling team as they try to survive after their plane crashes during a blizzard; not only do they have to survive the harsh weather conditions, they must also survive attacks from a pack of gray wolves. The Grey has a simple story but also goes deeper into the characters; for example, John Ottway (Liam Neeson) often questions life and has lost faith, and some of the audience may be appreciate the attempt to create deep characters. The movie has plenty of thrills, including many chase scenes with packs of wolves. Some of the thrills also come from the environment and the survival. Also, I thought the music was amazing and the film was shot beautifully; the acting was also great. It does get a bit repetitive, though, which may be because of the 1hr 50min runtime; it doesn't have as much variety as it could've had and does feel like it drags on.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend The Grey. As of 9/15/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, if you'd like to save some money.<br /><br />The Grey has strong violence and gore, including strong animal violence. No sex or nudity.

145162607X|4.0|In this fourth book of The Cousin's War by Philippa Gregory, we're introduced to the Neville sisters, Isabel and Anne. In The Lady of the River, Gregory gives us a taste of what it was like to live with, and love, the Woodville family - but sides are switched and now we're on the opposite side, looking at that dratted large family with something very close to hatred.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter follows the story of Anne Neville and her tumultuous life as the daughter of the man who set aside the \\"sleeping king,\\" Henry VI, and put Edward IV on the throne instead. Edward, married to Jacquetta's daughter, Lady Elizabeth Grey, was once influenced by Anne's father, Richard Neville, but now has been drawn into the arms of the abundant Woodville family.<br /><br />This is a story of struggle - struggle between kings and would-be kings, between two insanely strong Queens (both of whom share a common bond through Jacquetta), and a story of how difficult a life Anne Neville had, beginning at such a young age. It's about blood feuds and witchcraft, murders and sickness, and life and death in the most base of forms. I really think the books contained in Gregory's Cousin's War series have been building up to this book - because this is where things really got interesting, it's where history became so turbulent that there was never once a sense of ease within the court of England. And honestly, Henry VIII, no matter how fascinating he is with his ability to set aside wives like they are delicacies he has lost his taste for, is not nearly as interesting to me as this period of time is. Margaret of Anjou and Queen Elizabeth (Formerly Elizabeth Grey) were strong, independent women who knew exactly how to muster the men of their families to their aid and pitted against each other... that was some formidable stuff.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Kingmaker's Daughter and look forward to seeing what Gregory has up her sleeve next.
0061438294|5.0|Buy it! Joe Navarro points out many useful \\"tells\\", what they mean and even real life examples. This is a wonderful tool for the assistance in understanding people.<br /><br />This book is great for a quick read; seriously, you could look at the pictures and read the captions below them. At the same time this book satisfies the need for more in-depth knowledge and detailed understanding of one's body language.<br /><br />If you are in sales, law or just want to understand people better this is worth your time and money. Just as one \\"tell\\" does not reveal everything about what a person may be thinking nor does this book. This adds a new perspective to be used in conjunction with other observation tools you may have (listening versus hearing, word selection, clothes, habits...).

B008B0QH5S|1.0|Every great 80's band has in mid-to-late career seemed to go off the deep end on at least one project that they greatly regret later.  For Duran Duran, it was 2007's Red Carpet Massacre. For Depeche Mode, it was 2001's Exciter (who haven't come back from the abyss since), for U2 it was 1993's Zooropa, etc.  I thought PSB were exempt from this phenomenon, but it turns out they are just human too.  I guess in a way, it highlights the pure genius of their previous works but at a cost to their long-time fans.  I see this less as an album in its own right than a grab-bag of cutting room floor outtakes, bottom shelf B-sides, and grade D filler.  Comparing this to Behaviour is simply ridiculous - that album is light years better than this.<br /><br />Boys:  Just put down the synths, slowly back away, and then book it to your next recording session to right this wrong.  Like as soon as next year if possible.  Yeesh.

B0052AC8C6|1.0|My wife and I have a habit of pre-screening our kid's movies before we let them watch (they're 8 and under).  This movie failed our test, bigtime.  **I wouldn't even recommend it for adults because it was just a dumb movie** (with admittedly an OK meaning)<br /><br />I might even rate it PG-13--not just because of the adult language, adult violence, and adult humor, but because I don't think my kids would even WANT to see it until at least age 13.  And even then they'd only see it just to know for themselves boring and dumb the movie was.  It's really not worth seeing which is too bad because a lizard holding a bug-eyed fish makes a cool cover and Dep is normally quite entertaining.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app for many reasons but my favorite things about it is that it reads the Bible to me,  so while I'm reading, if there's a word I'm not sure how to pronounce, which there are many of them, I can hear the correct pronounciation for the word. Also I love that I never have to worry about losing my place because it is always bookmarked. I also love that there are so many devotionals to choose from.

B005JS7VTQ|5.0|THE DOOBIE BROTHERS-ORIGINAL ALBUM SERIES...TOULOUSE STREET...THE CAPTAIN & ME...WHAT WERE ONCE VICES ARE NOW HABITS...STAMPEDE...TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS: Best remembered as a high quality singles band, THE DOOBIE BROTHERS' California brand of country rockin' boogie, buoyed by exquisite vocal harmonies, twin guitars and twin drummers, made them AM/FM radio mainstays throughout the 70s. Earthy belter/songwriter TOM JOHNSTON dominates the first four platters of this five disc set with rhythmic slabs LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, CHINA GROVE, and ROCKIN' DOWN THE HIGHWAY, although fellow axeman PAT SIMMONS gets in his share of folky licks via SOUTH CITY MIDNIGHT LADY and the chart-topping singalong BLACK WATER. A rollicking soul-daddy cover of MOTOWN oldie TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS (ROCK ME) proved to be JOHNSTON's last real triumph, before smokey-voiced keyboardist MICHAEL MCDONALD joined for TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS and the group's gradual shift to a mellower groove. SIMMONS' funky workout WHEEL OF FORTUNE and JOHNSTON's tranquil excursion ANOTHER PARK, ANOTHER SUNDAY reveal a depth and maturity beyond the obvious rock hits, making this set (five cds housed in cardboard sleeve replicas of the orginal album art) a sound purchase for any fan inclined to explore beyond their well worn copy of BEST OF THE DOOBIES.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE DOOBIES

1434440826|4.0|This book is definitely an interesting read. It is comprehensive and informative and written w/authority and intelligence. Anyone who is interested in the workings of the mind this is a book you should consider. At the end of the day however, there are not any citations to support this individuals research. He mentions many medical doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists and their research. It is up to the reader to research that to ensure it's accuracy. At the end of the day if one really wants to fact check what this book claims one simply has to try what he recommends and see if you find any value in it. I, myself, have and I am finding it to be my benefit. Good luck(:
B0000T70K4|3.0|Cosmopolis - A postmodern novel<br /><br />In an attempt to define the type of novel that contains the elements in Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis, I came across the term postmodernism. According to its definition, postmodernist fiction is marked by one or more of the following characteristics:<br /><br />* playfulness with language<br />* experimentation in the form of the novel<br />o less reliance on traditional narrative form<br />o less reliance on traditional character development<br />o experimentation with point of view<br />* experimentation with the way time is conveyed in the novel<br />* mixture of \\"high art\\" and popular culture<br /><br />All of these elements exist in the slim but very compelling work about one day in the life of a very wealthy young investment banker who gets into his limo to go and get a haircut. Simple enough. But it's not so easy. DeLillo's prose style especially the dialogue goes in many different directions that sometimes you get lost in what the characters are talking about. There is always a meaning to the madness but it's not always clarified. Therein lays the frustration I found in the work.<br /><br />Example:<br />Eric Packer, the main character sits with a consultant named Chin inside his luxurious limousine equipped with all kinds of fancy computer screens from which he can monitor stock activity and the news. The conversation they have is about how to interpret the latest data from the world markets. What Eric is doing is borrowing large sums of money to purchase the right to buy yen at a future point in time. He hopes the yen's value will be at a lower rate relative to the US dollar, so as to score a big profit.<br /><br />\\"Time for you to do what.\\"<br />\\"Yes. All right,\\" Chin said.<br />\\"You don't know this? We both know this.\\"<br />\\"There's work to do in the office. Yes. I need to retrace events over time and see what I can find that applies.\\"<br />\\"Nothing applies. But it's there. It charts. You'll see it.\\"<br />\\"I need to back test currencies. I don't know, like into the misty dawn.\\"<br />\\"We can't wait for the misty dawn.\\"<br />\\"Then I'll do it here to save time. That should make you happy. I do time cycles in my sleep.\\"<br />\\"You see this in fruit flies and heart attacks. Common forces at work.\\"<br />I'm so obsolete I don't have to chew my food.\\"<br /><br />It's satire without being overly funny but through the dialogue one can catch glimpses of humor. The book is filled with sharp dialogue and bits of skepticism and a measurable detachment; and the brief sentences do not necessarily convey much since people don't speak this way so we have to reread certain passages to understand the interaction.<br /><br />There is very little in the way of human feeling in the novel. The work is as cold as the capitalistic world the main character inhabits. It's an expressive work on how one character is a slave to money and, computer screens. It's a bold statement on the direction the world is headed.<br />Although there are some brief human touches to Eric, for instance he is a capitalist who reads poetry so he can become conscious of his own breathing and therefore take notice of things. By the second page we already know Eric's fate. And a little farther along we come upon a man named Benno Levin who we learn is responsible for Eric's ultimate end. This comes to us before the first half of the book is over.<br /><br />In this regard, DeLillo is innovative with style and very keen to reorganize the elements in the story so we know these things early on. This is certainly a break from traditional narrative storytelling. Each new scene plays out in a manner that at first we do not know what is happening and to whom. We have to read on to get the entire picture and even then we are not entirely sure of what is taking place in relation to what happened before.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed DeLillo's description of the technological innovations of today's world and how it is used for making money. He brings in all the terrible occurrences that we see in the news every day, terrorism, greed, human cruelty, guns, criminals, chaos, sex and violence, and the rapid pace whereby we can access these things through technology. Eric's existence is made less as a person in an ever shrinking world as his dependence on technology (the elaborate monitors he has set up in his car) has choked the life out of him in his pursuit to make even more money.<br /><br />I found myself not necessarily caring too much for Eric Packer, although I'm sure that was precisely Mr. DeLillo's intention. Eric is as meaningless as some of the fancy dialogue that comes out of his mouth and the other characters as well. We know he is immensely rich; a 48 room apartment and a chauffeured limousine from where we are treated to him having a rectal examination while he chats with a female associate. Outside the car there are demonstrations, a funeral procession for a rap artist and scenes of violence as a man sets himself on fire. On the computer Eric watches replays of a killing of a former businessman whom he hated with all passion and watched repeatedly on the monitor as he is stabbed to death by an assailant. A fascination with human suffering and death is another morbid curiosity that technology brings to us in full flower every day.<br /><br />There are vivid descriptions of city life that Eric sees through the car window on his journey to get a haircut. \\"He felt the street around him, unremitting, people moving past each other in coded moments of gesture and dance. Eye contact was always a delicate matter. A quarter second of a shared glance was a violation of agreements that made the city operational. Who steps aside for whom, who looks or does not looks at whom. There were sirens in the distance, fire trucks caught up in traffic, the sound hanging in the air, undopplered and car horns blowing locally, another hardness upon the day.\\"<br /><br />These sentiments remind us of just how detached we are to each other in the 21st century.<br /><br />The film version if this novel is currently playing in theaters with Robert Pattinson as Eric Packer.<br /><br />Review by Charles Blanchard<br />author of Mourning Doves After The Fireey. He brings in all the terrible occurrences that we see in the news every day, terrorism, greed, human cruelty, guns, criminals, chaos, sex and violence, and the rapid pace whereby we can access these things through technology.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|No other show is as rewarding for paying attention to the little details. This show forgets NOTHING! Something you might deem insignificant can come into play later on in a major way.<br /><br />No other show can keep me on the edge of my seat like this one. It's my favorite of all time, and this season is as great as the ones that came before it. The last 6 episodes of the season is probably the greatest stretch of episodes the show has ever had, and without the first 7--which people might consider slow and not much happened--they wouldn't be as great as they are.<br /><br />The last 5 minutes of 4x11: 'Crawl Space' got the reaction from me that horror movies (and other shows) only wish they could achieve. It might be the greatest moment of the show to date, and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and I think I did both at the same time.<br /><br />They say that the acting can only be as good as the writing, but I think they both work off of each other to create this brilliant show.

B0068THAGY|1.0|Insipid sentimentality with production values and a big soppy musical score. And a derivative plot, utterly predictable. Has the worst aspects of King and Spielberg.
B008SVS0K0|5.0|What else can I say?  Every song on this album is great.  Some just hit you in the face with how awesome they are. I loved Billy Talent I and II, and I liked III (it wasn't bad by any means, I just honestly liked the first two a little better).<br /><br />But this album, it's just got so much energy, all the songs are catchy, and I can't stop listening to it.  Like usual BT, the lyrics are quite insightful and well-written.  Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, you will not regret it.
B000MXJ7LS|2.0|I was shocked to see this came from Oliver Stone with such a weak and predictable script and cable-TV quality production values. The plot uses the backdrop of 9/11 to get immediate audience sympathy but if the story had been about buried coal miners instead, it would have been more obvious what a one-dimensional screenplay was being used here.<br /><br />The film suffers from a very long saggy mid-section where not much happens for nearly an hour, apart from cutting between the buried men and their distraught families. Much of the A-list talent is lost on restrictive roles that any character actor could have whistled through. And fundamentally, for such a tragic and monumental event, this film fails to capture any of significance of what happened.<br /><br />For a better \\"man buried alive\\" story, try 127 Hours. For a significantly better film about 9/11 that truly captures the emotion, I'd recommend United 93. Otherwise, this is very weak movie that attempts to use 9/11 to pull at the heart strings but wastes the talent and doesn't deliver.

B006JD48NM|5.0|... one of my business mentor mentioned that movie to me, and as such I got it and watched it, and found it full of lessons, ... and a wonderful reflection on Senna's life. ...<br /><br />I became a F1-Fan long years after Senna, at a time when M Schuhmacher dominated the scene. I was always intrigued by the precision, the pushing of limits, the passion but also the shear international impact F1-Racing had.<br /><br />The movie shows wonderfully the progress F1-Racing made in the 80 and 90th - a sport of kings. It shows the competitive nature of the race car drivers, and the limits / demons they are facing.<br /><br />The movie could serve in multiple ways: ... love for the Brazilian people, love for competitive sports, for passion, ... but also as a reminder that true sportsman-ship should always depend on human abilities and not on technical gimmicks, while the gimmicks should be used to improve safety. And, on that note: ... there were clear warning signs which SENNA ignored, and which potentially cost him his life.<br /><br />It's tough to find a balance between strive for victory, and control of risks involved.<br /><br />A much more complex movie / documentary than it intended to be. ...  AN AMAZING MOVIE ...
B008ER9QLK|5.0|For a 15+hr quadrilogy there's enough of a span for one to find any fault.  As a whole, this Ring version is one of my favorites.  Other than the wondrous minimalist set design which I have come to enjoy (amazing what one can do with planks), its the combination of singing quality, acting, and chemistry between performers (Kaufman and Westbroek immediately come to mind) that really makes this Ring fly.
B0072OFM28|4.0|The problem with the second season of Spartacus is that since the Romans and the gladiators are no longer living under the same roof, every episode is effectively divided up into Roman scenes and gladiator scenes, and their is no question which are more interesting. The cruel, scheming, ambitious Romans remain endlessly watchable, whereas the gladiators when left to themselves do nothing but engage in endless debates about the meaning of freedom and the conduct of war. Which would you rather watch, a roomful of drunken, sex-craved Roman aristocrats torturing a captured ex-slave to death by flaying him alive, or a roomful of ex-gladiators debating the ethics of slave rebellion? The gladiators only come to life when in direct conflict with the Romans, as in the spectacular immolation of the arena in Capua (a superb sequence) or in titillating episodes like the one in which Spartacus and his men invade a brothel and impale all the naked customers on their swords as the victims' backsides wriggle (in close up), their private parts flop about (ditto), and the television screen is covered in gore.<br /><br />The problem is not the actors, all of whom do their best. The problem is that the writers have a habit of confusing their series with the classic Kirk Douglas movie, wanting to infuse it with some of that old epic's high moral seriousness. It doesn't work. The sermonizing is hard to take in a series like this. Spartacus the TV series (NOT Spartacus the movie) is essentially high gloss soft porn dignified by some remarkably intelligent acting and superb production values. (I could watch Lucy Lawless smirk and glower for hours without becoming bored.) To be honest, I'm more interested in Spartacus the half-naked crazed killer than in Spartacus the philosopher. (There is also a serious plausibility problem. How did all these brutalized trained killers turn into Thomas Jeffersons?)<br /><br />At it's best, Spartacus remains tremendous fun and I'm looking forward to the final season. I just hope their will be more sex and gore, and less moral posturing. Nevertheless, I have to conclude by stating that since all of the most interesting characters are dead now, I have no idea how the writers are going to pull it off.

1250010489|5.0|Mark Russinovich is a great storyteller.<br /><br />If you've heard him speak at a technical conference, you know that this Microsoft technical fellow is whip-smart. His presentation on how to root out malware is like an episode of CSI:Sysinternals--fascinating and compelling even if you're not a security geek.<br /><br />So it shouldn't be surprising that Russinovich's new novel, Trojan Horse, is an absolute page-turner that's solidly grounded in modern computer technology.<br /><br />This is the second novel from Russinovich, who published Zero Day two years ago. His characters from that novel make a return appearance here. Jeff Aiken is a brilliant computer security expert, a PhD and amateur rugby player who comes in to clean up security messes in big corporations and secret government agencies worldwide; he's assisted by his girlfriend and partner in digital crime solving, Daryl Haugen. She's also a PhD, a former NSA spook, and an expert at cracking into computer code.<br /><br />The story starts off in sparsely populated Central Washington, where foreign attackers have succeeded in taking down the power grid for 14 minutes with a piece of custom-built malware. That kicks off a series of small tragedies, including a delicate bit of brain surgery that goes wrong when the computer running the operating room keeps rebooting.<br /><br />From there the story begins rolling and picks up speed as it caroms around the world, to London and Geneva and Prague and Ankara. Bureaucrats from the U.N. keep getting in the way of British and American intelligence agencies. The Iranians are behind everything, or maybe it's the Chinese. Or maybe it's someone else completely.<br /><br />There are kidnappings and shootings and one hilarious and hair-raising chase scene involving three cars and an ultralight plane through a desolate stretch of Turkey that ends in ... well, I won't spoil it.<br /><br />The plot holds together admirably, with Stuxnet playing a key role in the breakneck sequence of events. There's a certain predictability to the plot, as with any thriller, but there are also some artful misdirections and one twist that I guarantee you won't see coming.<br /><br />Normally I cringe at the silly technical errors in novels that try to describe computer technology. But Russinovich's mastery of code (malicious and otherwise) keeps things from running off the rails. Interestingly, an Android Trojan leads to the downfall of one of the bad guys, but the most dangerous vector, the carrier of the Trojan Horse that gives the novel its name, is a mythical program called OfficeWorks--a thinly disguised pseudonym for Microsoft Word.<br /><br />I read the first half of this novel on a flight to Eastern Europe, and when I got off the plane in Berlin I found myself eyeing my fellow passengers suspiciously. Was one of them secretly a double agent? A triple agent, even? It took hours to shake the paranoia.<br /><br />Russinovich's writing has matured in this second effort, and his characters have genuine staying power. His work reminds me of Dick Francis, who wrote some superb thrillers about the world of horse racing from which he had retired. Both authors write about what they know, and they bring small details to the story that help it ring true.<br /><br />It's a shame that summer's almost over, because this is ideal beach reading--a thriller that tackles a couple of big issues and will get you thinking (and worrying) about the fragility of the world's power grid and information infrastructure. But it's also perfect for a long plane ride or a rainy weekend.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Ed Bott - Contributing Editor, ZDNetsequence of events.

0142428272|1.0|I must apologize to Follett for giving this book a bad review. The story is actually terrific. My poor review is for his publisher. I bought this product as a CD audiobook, and was in the middle of the first section when I realized that Disc 7 was missing! Imagine purchasing a book only to find that it simply skips from chapter 4 to chapter 7 - and you have no idea what has happened in between. It's a long book, so I am certain I will figure it out - but considering what they charge for audiobooks (and the relative low cost of burning a few CDs and putting them in the box), I found this extremely disappointing.

I trudged through the Leopard, at times considering shelving it.  The Phantom falls somewhere in between.  At times, I felt Nesbo was a bit too detailed and long winded, tedious at times.  His main character is always very interesting and the more you are familiar with his past, the more enjoyable the novel.  I have to agree with other reviewers on the fact that Norway seems such a bleak, depressing culture, very cool and white on the outside, but rotten on the inside.  If you're a Nesbo fan, this will satisfy you, if you haven't read him, I wouldn't recommend this as your first read.

1932100660|5.0|Very comprehensive study showing the dileterious effects of animal protien on human health.  A bit redundant, but well worth the read.  Its probably at the root of why so many people have choosen to become vegetarian
1401309666|5.0|Timeless as an historical observation and prophetic in its application to the evolution of supply and demand.  A must to follow the course as it defines an age.  I don't know what I mean either.  Its really an awesome book.

B003L16FAE|3.0|I own a copy of PREDATOR on DVD , an was scaning the reviews before I bought this new Bluray version . Most of the reviews are 5 years old an are for the last BLURAY verison , not the 2012 . I wish Amazon would make a better catagoy for theses new copies that come out , rather than cross -copying them from previous reviews . So when looking to buy the lastest version of a movie , please visit the \\" NEWEST REVIEW \\" , and make your deceison from that . Predator is one of the best Schwarzenegger movie ever made , an also the best in the series . Most movies made in the last century didnt have the same digital quality , the newer movies have now days an the tranfer is quite different an is costly to do so . Perhaps that is why they havent gotten the BLURAY We all want to own . Its up to FOX to make that decision , but your money if you wanna spend it on something you will reget . You make the choice .
0439023513|3.0|I used the Amazon Kindle lending program for this book and I'm quite glad I did.  Many thanks to the friend who loaned me the book, saving me from paying more than I would have liked.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first book although the concept of sending children to fight to the death for the amusement of others is seriously disturbing.  The second book was interesting, but at this point I wanted more from the main character, although I think that in Peeta I found what I would have liked to have seen in Katniss - moral character.  By the third book Katniss was more annoying than heroic, but then she was actually more of a pawn in the game than a real player, so her character may have actually suited the role she played in the book.  In many ways this mirrors the concept of ordinary people whose lives are irrelevant and disposable in the power plays of the political classes.  You could see this to a certain extent in the first two books, but it is glaring in the third, and final, installment.<br /><br />What seems to have bothered many is the ending, and I have to agree with them - it left something to be desired.  I would have liked a more positive conclusion - yes, the happy ending - but looking at the character development of Katniss throughout the story, this ending fit who she was.  She stood up when she had to, and found moments of heroism, but in the end, she was an ordinary person in difficult times.  The ending was appropriate for that Katniss, and brought the series to a satisfying, if not electric, conclusion.<br /><br />I'm glad I read all three of the books, and there is much in the series to think and talk about - but I'm very glad that I only had to buy one of the books.  The library is a good option if you want to know what all the fuss is over the Hunger Games.  But, I still would recommend it, and if you can't borrow the books, buy them - the story is well crafted and worth the short amount of time it takes to read all three books.  If you want to skip the books and see the movie instead - you will see most of the \\"what\\" of the story, but you'll miss a lot of the \\"why\\".the books and see the movie instead - you will see most of the \\"what\\" of the story, but you'll miss a lot of the \\"why\\".

B008S4YZCO|5.0|Best game ever I loved it the monsters were so cute and you felt like you were actually training and raising the cute baby monsters again I loved it download the game and you wont regret it.

B008N1V11U|1.0|It will be hard for me to recview this app since I CAN NEVER GET IT TO PLAY.  Ive had this installed for months but I haven't played it.  I get ready to sit down and play it and it says it has to download another 700mb?!?  So... I started the DL.  Days later (because I don't just sit here with my Kindle on for no reason), I don't see it in my notifications any more so I click on it because I was ready to play it... and guess what?  Now it says its not installed.  So, I re-installed it.  Then... guess what?  I have to DL the dang 700mb again.  You know, Gameloft has some great games.  But, Ive bought Asphalt 6, Asphalt 7, Spiderman, Some dungeon game that I ended up uninstalling bc of greed and making you buy crap in game... even though you already paid for the app, and now Batman.  You w9ild think I would learn my lesson about how big of a space hog their games are... except that they have the best games Ive seen kn the Kindle.  If they could just stop making them so BIG.  Its bad enough Kindle only gives you 5GB of available memory in the first place with no way to upgrade.

B004WGIXX4|2.0|If you have seen Friends with Benefits you will be disappointted in this one. This movie has zero class. It is vulgar and sleezy from the begining to the end and has none of the charm of FwB. The chemistry is also missing in the lead characters. Do yourself a favor and watch FwB again and just skip this one.
B0067EMFLA|5.0|This CD was excellent, I absolutely loved the use of techno, pop, punk and other elements as audio detail highlights to the rocky punk genera the group brings,  Lyrics were well thought out as well as easy to follow along with, while still retaining a detailed purpose in why they were being used to tell the story of each song.  I should let every one know their 2 music videos are equally as high class and cool and everything else that makes my inner rocker want to come out and play.  By the way the lead singer is hot and I want to marry her.  There is not too many girls out there that make pink hair rock.  Theatre is probably my favorite track with Get Well and Make A Move on the podium right behind.  Overall I would have no problem listening to any one of the tracks on this album at any time!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome app awesome app awesome app fun game interesting woo fun yaay temple run. its a good review blahhhhh blah blah
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Finally!  Original Kindle Fire owners were stuck with a Facebook icon that just led to the Facebook mobile site ever since it was released, so it's refreshing to finally see a real Facebook app available for download.  Sadly, it was a bit buried inside the Amazon App Store and required a good bit of searching; why this isn't the first app that comes up when searching for Facebook and instead 50 rows down, i'll never know.<br /><br />That said, this is pretty much the same application that's available for normal Android devices.  It shares the same version number (currently 1.99) and works reasonably well.  Like the Android version it could use an overhaul to improve speed and loading of the news feed, but it's still better then using the mobile site so it's a welcome addition to the App Store.<br /><br />EDIT: Updating the title to reflect that apparently this only works on the Fire HD.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Not much to say, it's Star Wars. I had never seen a full Star Wars movie and my husband wanted this so we bought it. It's not a collector's edition, basically, it's just the movies in a book. We like it, but it's not for a die-hard Star Wars fan, that's for sure. The delivery was quick and the price was cheaper than in store. Although, the front of the \\"book\\" has a scratch on it like someone went too hard on the box with a razor blade or something.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|This is the most incredibly stupid book I have read in my life. It should carry a warning for people to avoid it.  I am equally concerned for the people who gave it 5 star ratings.

B0087HT36U|1.0|The app will not launch. Would be nice if they posted info about compatible devices. I will have to load it on a different device. I wish Google and Amazon would wake up to the not-so-secret concept that the best way of building loyalty is to not FORCE loyalty. If it's an Android app, it should play on any tablet or android phone.
0345522478|5.0|I first noticed this book because it had a cool cover. Yeah, I often judge books by their covers okay? :)<br /><br />The long-lived main character, Atticus, is a fun, friendly, well rounded character who loves his dog, adventure, nature and a bit of nookie when time allows!<br /><br />I'm typically a slow reader, but I shot through this in a few days. It's really nice to find an author who produces a book that talks to me as if I were watching it for myself.<br /><br />I have to go now, book 2 is Hounding me!

B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey, then you have to read Bared to You!! While the two stories are similar, the characters in Bared to You are both flawed & coming to terms with things in their past. This is a MUST read for fans of Christian & Ana. Gideon & Eva will continue the fantasy! Definitely enjoyed this book, can't wait for the sequel in October.
B006D9EJ3Q|5.0|The question is, can this story get any better in season two.  To me it should of won best pic in golden goble.  Although the show start over with a new plot there are some returning charactors that made season one so good.  A change of coasted and reference to plot in episode 11 (birth) should entice..
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great story with a ton of characters. Books this size are perfect on Kindle makes it much easier to read such massive tomes my only complaint on this \\"bundled\\" set is you dont know when your close to finishing each book since it only has one percentile bar.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There is a lot of sex, but there is more to this book too. You fall in love with the charters. You start to get emotional about their trials and tribulations.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this lets you know how long you have to listen to music,  watch movies,  play games...etc. before the battery goes dead. also lets you know my kindle fire is charging. I would give it 5 stars but it can be improved by being in the back ground or a lot smaller it takes up the whole screen unnecessarily. interferes what I am doing as I plug it in to charge.

Live is much better and if there is a CD from the Austin performance I would buy it in a heatbeat.  He and his orchestra are brilliant.

B00756GKBA|5.0|I adore this album. I don't understand the negative reviews at all. Maybe they're just written by people with very little patience and expecting circa-1980s Madonna record (really?!). Give the album a full listen before you trash it. It's a journey. She goes through every emotion. There's ups and downs, there's love, heartbreak, silliness, sexiness, pain, anguish, violence, and the incredible \\"I Don't Give A\\" in which she narrates a typical day in her life set to a vaguely 80s funk/hip-hop beat. I adore this album.<br /><br />A more complete review to follow when I have the time. Until then, give it a real listen.<br /><br />Check out:<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild<br />Turn Up The Radio<br />Some Girls<br />Superstar<br />Love Spent<br />I'm A Sinner<br />Masterpiece<br />Beautiful Killer

At the end, Reacher is hitchhiking again. Still.
B003924NY0|5.0|This classic album series of 5 albums for about $4 each (here in Oz) is excellent value, particularly if all albums in the box set are good. My purchases so far, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Los Lobos, and now Johnny Winter have all put a smile on this dial.<br /><br />I purchased the set for the first two albums which I owned in vinyl before a bushfire claimed them. The initial Columbia release, Johnny Winter, established his blues credibility internationally with help from Rolling Stone magazine and blues stalwarts Willie Dixon on double bass and Walter Horton on harp on Mean Mistreater.  Winter's approach was raw with no frills, no compromise to populist production, no voice echoes, no guitar reverb, just straight ahead blues. The two acoustic numbers, the fabulous self penned Dallas and Robert Johnson's When You Got a Good Friend  showed that here was a guy who could play like Johnson and sing with power and authority; few could come anywhere near him.  Interestingly The Rolling Stones opened their 1969 Hyde Park concert with Winter's composition I'm Yours and I'm Hers which can be found on YouTube as I'm Yours She's Mine.<br /><br />Winter's vocals are under rated, although some might say he is an acquired taste, but there is soul, rock 'n roll, country and blues in this collection and he does them all well. Check out his version of Little Richard's Miss Ann from Second Winter - such great solos and no other major artist comes so close to sounding like Richard, apart from Otis Redding. The smokin' Highway 61 also from Second Winter was a vocal and instrumental performance reprised for Dylan's 30th anniversary concert in 1993. On Second Winter JW expanded his styles to great effect, while paying homage to his roots.<br /><br />Of the albums I hadn't heard previously Live Johnny Winter And is an energy packed show with Rick Derringer on second lead. It is flash and would have been great to see. Most of it works with slight excesses being my only criticism. Jumpin' Jack Flash out stones the Stones, just fabulous!<br /><br />Still Alive and Well is a very strong album, moving away from blues to Stones raunch territory. A couple of Stones' covers with Silver Train and Let It Bleed, both worthy versions (the Rough Guide to Rock 1999 edition states that Silver Train was written for Winter by the Stones - I'm not sure if that is true...??) . The country song, Ain't Nothing to Me is also good fare and you could imagine Mick and Keef on harmonies. Bonus tracks Little Richard's Lucille and Dylan's From A Buick Six are both on par with the rest of the album.<br /><br />Saints and Sinners to my taste is marred by cluttered arrangements and over production, a pity because there are good songs and some fine playing. A great soul number Hurtin' So Bad is saturated with horns, Blinded By Love by vocal choruses. Thirty Days sounds like a football team is singing the chorus. Interestingly the funky closer Feedback on Highway 101 is a rare Van Morrison outtake circa Hard Nose The Highway which is great but it too is cluttered along the way with superfluous electronic ceiling. By contrast the stark bonus track Dirty is the unlikely paring of JW's slide with Jeremy Steig's flute which works well, fabulous vocal too.<br /><br />The major drawback with these sets is that you don't get recording and personnel info unless they are on the rear cover of the album, but these can usually be obtained from the internet. The sound on each album is good to my ears, I think Still Alive and Well and Saints and Sinners must be lately remastered given the bonus tracks. All up, great value and a plus for any collection, the first two albums, Johnny Winter and Second Winter, being essential.n' Jack Flash out stones the Stones, just fabulous!<br /><br />Still Alive and Well is a very strong album, moving away from blues to Stones raunch territory.

B003U7RP80|5.0|What a fabulous concept from Rhino UK, five albums in original sleeves in one box set for very reasonable cost. What a disappointment that the sound quality on the Wicked Pickett album was overlooked. The fake stereo version has been used, even though the sleeve states 'mono' (conversely The Exciting Wilson Pickett states 'stereo' but is in glorious, warm, punchy mono).<br /><br />So on the Wicked Pickett album you have Pickett's voice out of the one speaker and the response chorus coming from the other speaker, which effectively dissipates power and cohesion in production which Fame studios and Jerry Wexler would have found. I compared the sound with tracks from the excellent Atlantic/ Rhino USA 2 CD compilation Wilson Pickett 'A Man and A Half' from 1992 and the difference for my ears is marked - I much prefer the mono sound. That said, the album itself is so good, and some people perhaps may prefer the chorus separated.<br /><br />The quality of material in the set, i.e. the songs themselves, many of which Pickett wrote, is great and take you from the early 60s exciting gospel tinged doo wop of The Falcons 'I Found a Love' to 1968's 'I'm In Love', a great Bobby Womack song which heralds the slicker soul style of the 70s. The  Exciting Wilson Pickett and The Wicked Pickett, for me are indispensable. The first album The Midnight Hour was issued to support the hit single and is really a collection of earlier singles where Pickett is finding is voice, some raw and the better for that - most are fabulous.<br /><br />Both The Exciting Wilson Pickett and The Wicked Pickett have his major 60s hits except If You Need Me (covered by Solomon Burke and The Rolling Stones) released by Double-L and available on A Man And A Half. But they aso contain covers of contemporary hits such as Knock On Wood from Falcon band mate Eddie Floyd, Don Covay's Mercy, Mercy, Irma Thomas/Rolling Stones Time is On My side, Bobby Herb's Sunny, Gary Bond's New Orleans and Solomon Burke's Everybody Needs Somebody To Love. Pickett's covers in many cases eclipse the originals.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with The Sound of Wilson Pickett apart from Soul Dance No 3 and Funky Broadway, two top funky dance numbers and the remake of I Found A Love Pts 1&2 where gospel moves into soul. After a few listenings the album revealed itself to be almost on a par with the previous albums, which is saying... all good.<br /><br />I'm In Love for my taste is a notch below the Sound of Wilson Pickett but it does have R&B hit Jealous Love, a tough Stagger Lee, and the hit title track with the lyrics \\"I feel just like a baby boy/ on a Christmas morning with a brand new toy/I'm in love''. Oh yes he does. She's Looking Good has the warning ''Mama get your mojo/papa get your gun/ I'm gonna get your daughter/gonna be your son''. Watch out, the Wicked Pickett's coming into your home - it sits nicely with his reputation - 'look but don't touch, he might bite your hand'! The album ends with another Bobby Womac song, one of those a torching soul slow burners, I've Come A Long Way.  Both The Sound Of Wilson Pickett and I'm In Love are in (true not fake) stereo, except perhaps for the track I Need a Lot of Lovin Every Day, which might be an earlier recording.<br /><br />If you like powerful, exciting, gritty 60s soul, with superb musicianship and Pickett's almighty voice, this collection from the Original Album can't be denied and is also great value.  I almost docked a star for the fake stereo Wicked Pickett, but that album even in it's lesser state is wonderful, but it is sad that Rhino UK has compromised the quality for which the Rhino name is renowned.Needs Somebody To Love.

145162607X|3.0|I have long admired and read Philippa Gregory's historical novels. This one, however, left me quite confused and somewhat disappointed. I wish that the author had included a flow chart for all of the prominent royal families. I had to keep re-reading sections to figure out which Richard,Edward, or Elizabeth she was writing about. I did enjoy her analysis of the political intrigues and the exposition of the shocking \\"abuse\\" of royal wives,mothers, and daughters. At times, her re-constructions of events and circumstances were repetitive. I do admire her ability to make us \\"feel\\" the conflict existing in the psyche of the female characters. Would I recommend it to anyone ? Yes. (But I would suggest that readers keep a character profile as they read.)

1400079144|3.0|I have enjoyed Dan Brown's books in the past just for the pure entertainment factor alone, I cast aside any broader implications his books have for many people. The Lost Symbol is entertaining and pensive no doubt, but it's way too long. I mean come on already Dan Brown! Sometimes it feels like there are paragraphs in the book just to fill it up a little more. Not much substance in most of the narration. I think if this book was well edited or thought out, it would have been a third its size and far more entertaining.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I have read all of Lee Child Jack Reacher novels and the Wanted Man is disappointing. If I didn't already know about Lee Child or his character Jack Reacher, is would simply be a ho hum story.  It appears that Child has run out of stories for old Jack and for the first 90% of the book he ambles through a very poor story and then in the last 10% decides to exterminate the entire universe....with so much disconnect it made it laughable. Common Lee Child, make the Jack come back as he used to be even if you have him in old age now.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|Super special effects; great action sequences about a very much bigger than life period. Great for those who like mythological based story lines. Good followup to \\"Clash of the Titans\\".
B0087HT36U|1.0|It should have been clearly stated in the description that there was no support for Jelly Bean and other modern OS versions. For those that don't know, devs DO get paid for each download of the free app of the day - it's just not by us. So when devs pull something like this to get more people to download instead of revealing the truth about their apps, it is not innocent. I would not have downloaded this app if the dev had done the right thing and told us it would not function at all and would make the phone unstable unless you had an old operating system, which I don't.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app for all kinds of creativity inspiration! I am on here about every day getting bee ideas for something
B006CBSE86|5.0|This band truly rocks. I love soundtracks and movie scores to begin with so I'm probably biased but I love the way they fit the many genre together, also i liked the theme they did with this album. I didn't think i would like Anette for vocals but again I'm amazed at the range of talent she has. They are all excellent musicians, and i hope they keep the music coming.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I was so excited about this product - no more buying or charging batteries! no more mouse crapping out on me while I was in the middle of something! - but I should have been skeptical right from the start when I had to shove the Mobee battery into the mouse rather forcibly to get the cover to fit correctly. With it in, I found the mouse would do things even if I wasn't touching it. The cursor would jump around the screen, text would change size (as if I were two-finger swiping), browser windows would try to go back on their own (as if I were swiping to the left). It would freak out completely if I put it on the charger. If the computer was asleep and I placed the mouse on the charger (which is, logically, when I'd want to do that), the computer would wake up and the cursor would bounce all over the place. So I could only charge the mouse when the computer was completely shut down.<br /><br />I'd finally had enough, so I decided to give up and remove the thing. I couldn't. I finally used a screwdriver to pry it out. It didn't look like I damaged anything in the process, but now my mouse keeps dropping its connection randomly, despite having a charge. I can't say for sure but it would seem something is damaged. I've written to Mobee support and heard nothing back, but from other reviews here it sounds like even if I get a refund from them, I'm out of luck on the mouse.<br /><br />A promising but frustratingly terrible product. Stock up on rechargeable AAs and save yourself the headache.
B007STBUIW|4.0|Excellent upgrade to a classic movie. Same as the original as far as content; therefore still elliciting, intense emotions and a sense of forboding.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I've never read any of the books...However, my daughter has, so I understood the basic premise. It isn't an awful film, yes, it deals with an awful truth about us as human beings & the societies we build. The subject matter may be uncomfortable for some to watch, an interesting, at times thought provoking film, to discuss with your pre-teen/teenager...But personally, I feel, not for elementary age children...It was competently acted & directed. It had action where it was needed & exposition where needed...But, it isn't a wholly original story. It's really just another one of many films that employ the art form to extrapolate on the ills of society..It's set in the future, it's dystopic, it's about people standing up for freedom & liberty against an elite number of men & women who use government to micromanage every aspect of their lives...The elite ruling class, & those whom they choose & deem their equals, reap the benefits of the good life while the other citizens are punished to fight for & eek out a meager living....As I said, it isn't an original premise...The hook, so to speak, is that children/young people, are the ones who are exploited to the detriment of their lives & the lives of their families...Sometimes disturbing, oft times silly, somewhat compelling, it will have you rooting for the heroes, but it doesn't really linger all that much afterwards...What it does accomplish is telling a pretty intense story with very little shock value scenes of gratuitous gore, sex/nudity, & profane,vulgar self expression/language...Which was quite refreshing & a rarity, considering this could have easily been the type of film that would have employed all of the aforementioned...But, as it is, it accomplishes not only telling the story, but, communicates the agonizing horrible reality of their existence without gratuity....Is it necessarily a reflection of the way people today would react to such a world??...I can't say, but it was a pleasant surprise...So, no, it wasn'tgreat, but it was an ok film....Even good....
B007DIQC90|4.0|Great for pubs and singing along!  It has a bluegrass rock kind of feel, and the lyrics are sometimes non-sequitors.  Plus, who doesn't want to hear a song about a pet dragonfly that tells a story to its masters about how the Queen of the Bees destroyed a deforestation project.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|i found this book to be the best out of the 3.  The premise of the book was interesting and I think their personal relationship showed more depth than in the previous books. This was a different kind of love story.
0385344333|1.0|I waited for months to read this book. The early review was a great come-on to buy the Reacher story. I love Reacher and Lee Child. However, I read this book in eight hours because it was so wordy and boring. It started out great. Reacher on the interstate trying to get to Virginia. He was picked up by two men and a lady. The night was cold (Nebraska is cold in the winter) and he was very much in need of a ride.<br /><br />The first half of the book was in the car with no action. No planning. No anything. The 2nd quarter was confusing. The last 1/8th was exciting. The final page told us very briefly what the plot was all about.<br /><br />The characters were not developed, confusion was rampant, no substance. Ending bad. This was not a Lee Child, Reacher book, couldn't be. Boring!<br /><br />Lee you disappointed me. Again, you will disappoint me with wimp Cruse playing Reacher in \\"Kill Shot\\".  Hopefully you will write a better novel next time.<br /><br />I rate this book a 1 because there was some action and a plot, finally.
B005IQZB14|4.0|You may not always like Cheryl Strayed while you're reading this book. You may not agree with her behavior, her morals or her choices. If you are unable to separate her behavior, morals and choices from her story, then this is not the book for you. For all the rest of you, I definitely recommend this book.<br /><br />When Cheryl Strayed was in her early 20s, her beloved mother died of cancer. Cheryl's family and marriage fractured in the wake of her grief and she was lost, broken and alone. She made an impetuous (and stupid) decision to hike the West Coast's Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert to Washington State. Why was it a stupid decision? She had never backpacked before--not even one night--and here she was going to be backpacking for 1100 or so miles. She had never used any of the equipment she'd bought at REI before her hike. She had never put it all together in her backpack (aka \\"Monster\\") to see if she could carry it until the night before her hike began. She had not even broken in her hiking boots. Any experienced backpacker would have thought her insane.<br /><br />And yet...she did it. She lost more than half of her toenails and endured incredible pain from the weight of her backpack and her ill-fitting boots. But she persevered. And, as one might expect, it had a profound effect on her. It gave her the time she needed to think and cope with what had happened to her life.<br /><br />Wild is part travelogue, part personal growth essay, part adventure yarn and all well written. Like her or not, you can't help but be damned impressed by her journey.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I honestly don't understand why Facebook can't get a mobile app that works well, to save its life. I have yet to see a \\"mobile\\" app, be it on iOS, Android Marketplace, or Amazon's Android Marketplace that is stable and works well.<br /><br />This version, while it does work, suffers from the usual Facebook Mobile Client issues - it's sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow and unstable. My first couple of times opening it, it crashed on me and brought me back to the App Store. But then again, I've seen the same performance and stability issues that seem to plague all of Facebook's mobile clients, so I don't think it's something to do with this specific version for the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - it's nice to know that Facebook, as a native app, is there, now - but I'm looking more forward to it being a truly functional, stable, and reasonably-performing app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty shades darker is an excellent read, it fulfilled all my expectations of what would happen in the story, it has a very enticing  sexual appeal and I can hardly wait to read the final book. The suspense is killing me...

0449000729|4.0|I bought this book because I really enjoyed reading \\"New York\\", by the same author. I enjoyed learning about the history of England (my home country), and to understand better how the various groups of people (Pagans, Romans, Normans, Anglo-Saxons, etc) came to reside in Britain, and how they related to one another. Being a native of Southern England, I enjoyed learning more about my ancestors (although I realize that the story is largely fiction).<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I found there were too many characters to keep track of. Each chapter (sometimes up to 100 pages) has its own set of characters, even though the family lines are consistent throughout the book. Unfortunately, I often found it challenging to remember who each character was, and how they related to one another. You wouldn't believe how many people there in England with a name like Charles, Edward, Mary, Margaret or Peter...<br /><br />Luckily though, if you get confused by all the characters in one chapter, you'll be able to start fresh with a new set of characters in the next chapter.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Yes, this movie is extra cheesy in the acting and realism categories, but it totally redeemed itself for me by giving veterans from different generations the spotlight for a bit. You don't often get to see them play the true heroes that they are. I really loved that! There were also a few lines that seemed to poke a bit of fun at the movie itself and those of it's caliber, which shows that the producers didn't take themselves too seriously either. If you can, let go of keeping things real and just enjoy the movie for what it is.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Enough has now been said about this Classic Hollywood Behind the Scenes movie.  I just like to say in brief \\"Don't miss it\\" in regards to its silent screen stars, acting, the script, photography, soundtrack as well as its atmosphere. The Special Features are just the icing on the cake! No other movie on this subject matter has ever come close to it.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book supported everything I'd known to be true and some of which I had forgotten. The routines are solid and so far seem to work. Just prior to reading this I was working out with a routine which had me pyramiding a lower weight for a total of 116 reps... I was spending hours in the gym. Prior to that I was doing a standard 3 sets x 10 reps with good weight and hitting about 10 sets per workout.. again hours in the gym. This work out has me in and out of the gym sometimes as quickly as 40 minutes yet I've been sore nearly every time. I haven't had a workout make me sore in a few years. So the concepts seem solid and seem to be working as well as being fast and efficient.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Had heard so many good things about this book that as soon as I could, I got it.  From the start,enjoyed the plot, the characters, the writing; could not put it down and read it in a matter of a couple of two-three days/nights.  Then came the ending and OHHHH, such disappoinment!!!  It seemed to me the writer got so tired while finishing this book, she just gave up.  What a waste of my gift card; I am very poor and I felt I wasted spending on this book, while I have so many others on my wish list am sure would've been a better investment.  If you are broke, wait to get it at the public library.

B008KEQMDC|4.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"What to Expect When Your Expecting\\" (A Comedy/Date Movie DVD review)...LIKED IT!!!<br /><br />Look for \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook snd become a fan...<br /><br />Genre: 8 Movie: 7<br /><br />What's it about?<br />A look at love through the eyes of five interconnected couples experiencing the thrills and surp...rises of having a baby, and ultimately coming to understand the universal truth that no matter what you plan for, life doesn't always deliver what's expected.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />This was a pleasant surprise for me. Not my style for sure, and I wouldn't have watched it had it not been for the review. Now I can say not only did I like it, but I think I might buy the movie. I would definitely watch this movie again...without being at gunpoint.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book gripped me from the start and with each chapter something new and unexpected unfolded.  I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.  I had seen another review which said the end disappointed, but this book kept my focus from start to finish.  Hope that my next book is just as involving.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Director Ridley Scott has again caused a stir among his fans with the spring 2012 release of \\"Prometheus\\", a science fiction/horror film which is ultimately a loose, muddled prequel to a much superior series of films: \\"Alien\\", \\"Aliens\\", \\"Alien 3\\" and \\"Alien Resurrection\\". Scott also directed \\"Alien\\" which was released in 1979 and is now considered one of the great triumphs of the science fiction genre. The primary question seems to be whether this film ought to be judged against its predecessors or merited on its own. Ridley Scott situates himself among the greatest science fiction directors of all time: Stanley Kubrick (2001), Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), George Lucas (Star Wars) and John Carpenter (The Thing). My favorite film of Scott's is \\"Bladerunner\\"; a Philip K. Dick adapted futuristic dystopia focusing on a grim and dark Los Angeles governed by detached corporation magnates. Scott put a tremendous amount of time and effort into this film. His potential for another great science fiction film is clear, and I suggest that it is quite relevant to measure a long-awaited prequel in relationship to Scott's earlier cinematic achievements. Consequently, I make no reservations that this response draws consistent parallels to Scott's earlier films.<br /><br />The cast is assembled with all of the hot new talent - Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw, the intrepid archeologist; her lover and fellow scientist, Charlie Holloway, played by Logan Marshall-Green; Michael Fassbender as David (the synthetic); and Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, the cold yet pragmatic corporate supervisor whose focus never diverges from the interests of the Weyland Corporation. The very talented Guy Pearce pops up at the end as Peter Wayland himself, an odd casting decision that I think Scott should have taken more consideration of. The actors are all excellent and this ensemble really could have made the film work. In a science fiction movie of this scale, the cast's chemistry is crucial to the story, especially when we are thrilled at their every next move, either individual or collective. I found it hard to care or have compassion for any of the characters which is odd because these are A-list actors.<br /><br />The film lacks character development which is essential because we are instantly thrown into the idiosyncratic worlds of our heroes and are meant to experience their on-screen, scary situations just as they do. In \\"Prometheus\\" we are taken right into the action before we have a chance to get to know and to develop interest in the main characters. What makes \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" so special is the introduction of what would become an iconic action/sci-fi/horror hero in Sigourney Weaver. We are poised at her every move. She has energy, courage and resolve unmatched by any previous science fiction film protagonist. \\"Ripley\\" is truly what made the \\"Alien\\" series so special. Sigourney Weaver recast the role of women in not only science fiction movies, but across film genres. Noomi Rapace as Shaw simply lacks a main character's energy and enthusiasm. I yearned for a heroine that may if even in a small way match the magic of Ridley Scott's \\"Ripley.\\" This was really disappointing. Following the Homer literary tradition, our hero must be strong and ready for any challenge!<br /><br />I was really looking forward to watching Guy Pearce in action. He is a phenomenal actor. He is sidelined and given very little on-screen time. Although Pearce is quite good as a morally-bankrupt mogul - the authority behind the whole mission - the question I kept asking myself is why not select an actor closer to Weyland's age. He is an old man. The makeup-job is poor and the plot trajectory does not allow for an interesting foray into Weyland's own story. Michael Fassbender is very good as Weyland's right hand and works in a sinister manner to try and help him achieve his goal of immortality.<br /><br />Reviewers are almost unanimously praising themovie's special effects. Yes. They are impressive. The world Scott creates here is rivaled only by the meticulous mind of James Cameron in his own recent creation: \\"Avatar.\\" Special effects are commonplace among top films today and are often accepted as a compromise to an intelligent story, interesting characters and a smart script - screenplay. There has never been an occasion that Ridley Scott has not wowed us with his magnificent cinematography, complex sets and rich color palettes. \\"Prometheus' \\" special effects and visuals do not save the rest of its aspects which are lacking, and this is predictably so with most movies today.<br /><br />The film is also being praised for a so-called \\"philosophical\\" premise. What is this - that the film's awkward series of events will lead us to an ultimate conclusion regarding the beginnings of life on Earth? This intrigued me at first, but failed in the end. The films existential questions are at best inconspicuous. The second half of \\"Prometheus\\" moves us away from the answers and substitutes yet another typical formulaic ending - a failed mission, an anarchic crew, a last-minute take-off and a hero left unscathed. What is the relationship of the \\"Humanoids\\" to the \\"Xenomorphs\\"? Why is there not even the smallest ounce of camaraderie among the crew? There are opposing agendas among all of the characters. If this was developed in much more detail the film may have really worked. The tenuous relationships between the characters should have been set up more carefully.<br /><br />As did many of my science fiction peers, I left the movie theater disillusioned with many questions and concerns. Some suggest that this is a good thing because it will enable us to revisit our curiosities when we see the next installment - Perhaps. But I find that when a first-of-a-series movie disappoints in so many ways it is always very difficult to redeem it in subsequent attempts. I wish Ridley Scott the best of luck. To his credit, the film has interested me enough to see if he succeeds next time.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This album from The XX did not disappoint! I especially love Intro, VCR, Crystalized, and Stars.<br /><br />Also can't wait to give their new album, Coexist a few more listens. So far, sounds good!
B003RT0NK8|3.0|The premise is restarting the sun, which is the opposite of the Global Warming scenario.  It is a confusing plot at times, but the surprise on the derelict ship is dramatic..  It is hard to follow, but in the end they pulled it all together.  More for Sci-Fi fans than a family flick.
B005LAJ1O0|3.0|When this started, I loved it. Some of the earlier episodes are very strong - with excellent themes, writing, surprises, and atmospheres.<br /><br />Towards the end, it does start to unravel. The strong ideas that were developed towards the beginning start to dissolve - and it becomes noticeable that the series was written as it went along. Early stories become red herrings, significant characters are soon forgotten about, and it starts to feel like you're not really being looked after as the audience. The final episodes were a real let down - they just didn't feel satisfying.<br /><br />Its a shame because it had so much potential at the beginning - a modern Twin Peaks, packed with intrigue and ballsy writing. But it just couldn't hold it together. By the end you might be frustrated that you'd invested any time in it at all.
B008CYDDWI|3.0|This movie is an alright movie but not the best around.  I would definitely put this movie far behind night of the living dead, day of the dead, and dawn of the dead.  I even think return of the living dead and evil dead movies are better.  You will however will get entertained from this movie, just do not expect too much.  The overall sound and picture quality is good.  I give this movie  solid C+

B005LAJ23A|5.0|I'm really into the living dead movies so when I heard that they made a series dealing with zombies I was thinking yeah I bet it will flop.  So when I watched the first season I was amazed how good it was.  I even now own the comics that were made before the season started.  I also own 2 copies of season two the limited edition zombie head and the regular one.  This season continues to be good and going strong.  You will not get bored watching this series.  I would definitely recommend this blu-ray to anyone who wants an edge of your seat series to add their collection!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|When going through the large selection of Amazon's science fiction titles, one stands out constantly with it's high ranking, Wool: Omnibus. At first I really didn't give any thought to how the overall story would play out or even if I would continue to read it. I was completely wrong on all accounts.<br /><br />The opening short story that sets up the tone is something that pulls you in. The characters are all multidimensional and each one possesses the ability to make you feel for them, loath them, and to ultimately feel what their going through. Even Silo 18 has a personality all its own.<br /><br />With being set in the far future as humanity escapes the deadly effects of some horrible event above ground. Hugh Howey weaves a tale of how humans over the course of countless generations have adapted to a life within Silo 18. Life goes on and so does the very nature of humans interacting with one another. The setting is created to offer the reader a chance to place them-self firmly into the world right from the start. Everything about the Silo is described a way that doesn't beat you over the head. The world is unraveled elegantly in such a way that isn't jarring.<br /><br />Overall the story and world of Wool is one that can be enjoyed by all. Whether your a fan of science fiction or not you can find Wool: Omnibus a pleasure to read.
0300176147|5.0|There are many amazing facts about the history of our world contained within this simply brilliant book and I am gifting a copy to each of my 5 children as something valuable to be cherished and passed on through the family and over the years.

Now he does not kill everyone, but the ones he likes watch out!!!  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  I would recommend to any horror movie fan!  Plus the blu-ray has a clear picture with good sound.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is great app. it tells you more than the battery juice of kindle fire.<br />I really enjoyed it. so try it yourself
B0088EDMMS|4.0|I am so glad Hocus Pocus is finally now available to own on blu ray! But I would have loved it so much more if there was just one special feature. Disney was lazy on this one!
B00081912E|5.0|Plays excellent! I wanted this for my dvd collection. It arrived in excellent condition, I have no complaint's at all and I would buy again if it was needed.Good service / delivery
B005LAIHPY|3.0|This movie is very entertaining with good special effects.  I believe the acting gets a passable grade but could have been better.  I believe this movie flopped at the box office because it came out a week after The Avengers.  I feel if they waited a little while longer then maybe it would have done better.  This movie is good but there are far better ones to choose from.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|\\"A Wanted Man\\" has gotten some critical reader-reviews and it probably deserves them since they are mostly from Lee Child's most devoted readers, who have come to expect him to produce nothing but five star thrillers.  There are some lazy repetitions, the characters aren't as well developed as they might be, and the plot sort of trips over itself.  All this might be a result of series burnout (Reacher is an unusually long series, after all), or the natural ups and downs of any series, with another great read coming next year, or as some have suggested, the distraction of Hollywood.  Or it may simply have come as a result of comparison with the rest of the series.<br /><br />For me, however, there are two aspects of the book that may have turned off some readers, but seem reasonable enough.  (Minor spoiler alert follows.)<br /><br />First, the story takes place in the Midwest/Great Plains region of the US.  Anyone who has driven in that part of the country will respect the challenge of describing its distances and lack of variety.  \\"Highway hypnosis\\" is real when you are doing 70+ on a road that doesn't curve, surrounded by sights that don't change.  Perhaps this is why not too many authors choose to place their stories there.<br /><br />Second, Mr. Child threw us a curve with the wheels-within-wheels element of his plot.  By the time all the strands are unwoven, one may be left wondering just what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Finally, this seems to conclude the loose trilogy in the Heartland and we can look for our scarred hero to locate trouble east of the Mississippi for awhile, perhaps until he finds reason to settle down in Virginia.<br /><br />At bottom, Mr. Child has consistently produced the best American thrillers for many years and, if this is below average for him, it still ranks as a gripping read that is better than most of the competition.

B004LWZW6U|3.0|You will have to know before you watch this movie that this movie is far from being serious.  I actually watched this movie because the first one made me laugh more then cringe.  I was amused but overall not as good as the first.  If you are into just naked women with big you know whats you will get entertained.  Thats why I was, but to expect an actual cool storyline then you will be let down.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Absolutely love the ad free version of Angry Birds. Great stress reducer. I previously played the free version with ads, which were very distracting. Thanks, Amazon!
B008XG1X18|5.0|It makes browsing  and pinning soo much eadier than trying to go through the web on my kindle! So happy.
1567184855|5.0|I've read through this book twice now, and I've started the second book.  I enjoyed it immensely.  It explains many of the feelings I get but can't readily explain and it makes me look closer at my relationships.  I haven't read too many books on regression therapy, or reincarnation, but this makes sense to me, and, it relates to the tier system in Asian religions that teach reincarnation.  I would recommend this book to anyone exploring reincarnation.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|James Cameron directs a very good movie, on a situation that will be remembered until the end of time.  This movie has everything, if you're into romance it has it, if you are into suspense it has it.  Plus the acting in it is very good.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who is thinking about buying a good movie.

B003XT603Q|5.0|Excellent read... a grippig story that takes you into the personal world of the protagonists, their struggles and joys. A must-read if you like Murakami, and a great start if you don't know his works yet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book started a little slow, but when it took off, it really took off!! It is full of twists & turn in every chapter. I love books like this that go back & forth from past to present in each chapter.
B0083KUZ86|4.0|There are many funny movies and this is at the top of my list.  Having Tom Green is just the icing on cake.  If you are having a bad day and need to be put into better mood then watch this movie and you will be smiling the rest of the day. Definitely recommended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;! BLOCK STORY SUCKS AND MINECRAFT ROCKS!!! IT HAS ALL THE UPDATES AND IS GOING TO KEEP GETTING BETTER LIKE THE COMPUTER VERSION! ITS WORTH $7.00!!!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is a beautiful film. Although made in the 1960s about a family in the 1940s, it holds up well.  It's a movie the entire family can enjoy together.  The songs have become standards.  Having recently been to Saltzburg and the German and Austrian Alps, it was fun watching the movie again and seeing the characters sing and act in places I had visited.  I highly recommend this movie.

B0021L9MJG|4.0|If you put the minds of the these two horror geniuses then you can't lose.  I'm a huge fan of booth and they will keep you entertained from the start through until the end, this movie is no exception.  The first story is cool all the way through until the last.  My personal favorite story is titled \\"The Crate\\".  If you're a fan of either one of these guys or booth like me you will like this movie.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Yes, it's unfortunate that the recordings are still (most likely) played at the wrong speed. But make no mistake: this is the Robert Johnson we've all been listening too, and it sounds better than ever.
B005R3WAVC|2.0|The show itself is wonderful and I have been watching it in order from start to finish.  My DVR didn't record this particular show and I could not figure out any other way to watch it right away.  So given all that I was on the desperate side.  The quality was not good.  I got the story line, but the quality was \\"jerky\\" and fuzzy.  I hope I never need to watch any more episodes this way.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movie. Action packed, with great actors in the lead character roles. Subject matter may be disturbing to some people and definitely not suitable for little kids, since the fight scenes are pretty graphic.
0345472322|5.0|An absolutely awesome book that everyone should read.  We all hear about having the right mindset.  This book helps you learn how to achieve it.  This book helps learn to have healthier & productive relationships in business, with your spouse, children, siblings & friends.  Wish I read this years ago.
0525953728|5.0|I got caught up in all the media's reports, all the \\"special\\" tv shows, all the interviews with \\"ex-seal\\" members who speculated on how the raid went...FINALLY THIS BOOK SETS THE RECORD STRAIGHT! I get the tradition of seal members not talking, I get it, but this bok is worth reading and good for the author to write it, he doesnt compromise national security, it doesn't reveal trade secrets, he doesn't ID other members, its his first hand account, and I'm glad to read it, you should too
B004SIP6QI|2.0|Unlike a lot of the reviewers here -- who had problems with the casting, the acting, the slow pacing, and the paper-thin romantic premise -- these things didn't bother me, because the story otherwise had a reasonable structure and flow, and I was curious enough about \\"how this will resolve\\" to keep watching.  But then what finally happened in the \\"resolution\\" was so utterly predictable, in the sense that it's something that would happen only in a HOLLYWOOD MOVIE, that it ruined the rest of the film.<br /><br />Here's the underlying problem -- when the Civil War starts and most of the men go off to fight in the Confederate Army, some men stay behind and avoid the battles, presumably because they are older or too young or for some other reason.  But almost immediately, those \\"stay behind\\" guys begin making snide comments to the soldiers and the townspeople like, \\"OH, DON'T WORRY, WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE WOMEN WHILE YOU'RE AWAY.  HEH-HEH-HEH.\\"<br /><br />And so you can predict, right there, that these \\"stay behind\\" guys will become the typical gang of mindlessly ruthless murderers and rapists and robbers, who will pillage the innocent townsfolk as soon as all the other men leave for battle.  And of course, that's exactly what happens here -- a pack of five or six of them roam around the town and the farms and either threaten to kill people without mercy, or actually DO kill them and torture them, often for no apparent reason, even enjoying their brutality, etc.<br /><br />Okay, fine.  Let's just say that this \\"roving gang of murderers\\" premise is part of the story.  It wasn't that unbelievable under the circumstances, with all of the righteous and high-minded menfolk having gone off to fight in that oh-so-noble activity called WAR, after all.  But then you have Nicole and Rene, who are left behind, living in a HUGE farmhouse, all alone, and who KNOW (as their neighboring farmers know) that the roving band of murderous thugs is roaming the countryside.<br /><br />So what would anyone do in that circumstance, where the PRIMARY DANGER in your area is not the war itself, but the roving band of murderers?  Obviously, the innocent townspeople and farmers should band themselves together, and arm themselves to the hilt in defense against a possible attack by the roving gang, right?  But no, that would make too much SENSE -- and this is a HOLLYWOOD MOVIE, after all.  So what the people stupidly do instead is continue to live separately, relatively defenseless, and just kind of HOPE that the roving gang leaves them alone.  Huh?<br /><br />At one point, Rene's father even comes back from the war along with two other male friends, finding Nicole and Rene in the farmhouse, but instead of all of them defensively banding together in case of an attack by those roving murderers, what do they do?  They all separate.  \\"Oh, you three men go and stay somewhere else, like out in the woods, or in a cave or something, and just leave us two women here in this six-bedroom farmhouse, by ourselves.\\"  Huh?<br /><br />Then when Jude finally comes back from the war and reunites with his long lost love, Nicole, what does HE do after a sexy night with her?  He sends her and Rene back to the farmhouse, to be all alone again (and in a rather \\"happy go lucky\\" manner, no less) while he goes off on his own.  HUH?<br /><br />HOW, HOW, HOW can these characters have forgotten that, uhhh, there's kind of, uhhh, like, uhhh, a ROVING BAND OF MURDERERS OUT THERE, RIGHT NOW, and uhhh, like, uhhhh, this means that they could all be, uhhh, BRUTALLY ATTACKED at any minute, and RAPED, TORTURED, and MURDERED?<br /><br />I mean, how many HOLLYWOOD MOVIES have this same old and completely stupid scenario -- there's a totally known, totally obvious, totally life-threatening danger confronting a group of people, and how do they respond?<br /><br />\\"Okay, let's all split up and hope that nothing bad happens to us.  Ha-ha-ha.\\"<br /><br />So as Nicole and Rene merrily saunter down theroad, by themselves, guess what happens to them......within SECONDS?<br /><br />They are surrounded by the roving gang, of course -- and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Is there some Hollywood filmmaking school where they are REQUIRED to teach writers and directors to create wholly cliched, predictable endings like this?  Doesn't anyone think for a minute how stuff like this undermines the entire film and insults the viewers?  Doesn't anyone realize that the story itself needs to establish a baseline credibility, so that the viewer can suspend disbelief and buy into the premise?<br /><br />Hey, Hollywood morons -- WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?
B000KIRT6A|4.0|I was willing to experiment because of the price. Performance is great, works as good as any other eq I've used. Since there is a lot of plastic I don't know how well it would take a hard fall.<br /><br />Four stars only because a \\"0\\" notch on the sliders would be nice.

B008602KQI|2.0|If I had not read the book first I would have been lost as the main topics jumped from highlight to highlight.  The choppiness reminded me of DUNE, the one with Sting,  only able to be followed after reading the book.  I hope the remaining 2  films are better done.<br />  Read the books. They are much better than the film.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I`ve read everything Crouch has written, and I like the way he can create a creepy atmosphere in every book, and really stretch the suspense. The plot is original, but with Crouch you sometimes have to forget being too critical, and let him take a few \\"narrative licenses\\" when it comes to the story.<br />I`m reading this kind of books before sleeping, and what I like is a story that makes me look forward to go to bed every night, even when I`m not that tired (have to go to work early in the morning...)<br />This one managed to do its job, even if it wasn`t as good as Run or Desert Places.<br />I`m looking forward to the next one.

B005H1SDQU|4.0|A disc that shows the great talent of this guitar and did not stop in time. There's interesting news and different guitar sounds, showing his quality as a player. And most excellent work of Steve, demonstrating their willingness and commitment in the work it undertakes. There is no repetition. Moreover, the bonus disc's instrumentals that add nicely to the work. It is worth having for those who know and enjoy their music.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author takes us through his career as a Seal including his time with the exclusive Seal team tasked with the most difficult missions.<br /><br />A number of the deployments are routine to the extent that being deployed to remote areas in two wars can ever be considered routine. The reader is taken along on multiple missions in Afghanistan and Iraq and gains a better appreciation of the life of a Seal outside the wire.<br /><br />This is a great story of a warrior's career. Like an NFL career it takes a heavy toll on the body and the mind.  Unlike the NFL there's no long off season, no benchwarmers ready to provide a break and no semi retirement playing second to a star.<br /><br />Hardware freaks will have severe envy as the author discusses their equipment and the virtually bottomless armory and talented personnel available to provide them with highly personalized weapons for any occasion. Not the James Bond stuff but the best of the military and civilian world.<br /><br />Perhaps 20% of the book is devoted to the mission to get OBL. It provides great insight into the intelligence and planning, the preparation and finally the raid. The raid itself is a classic case study of why the Seal way of waging war works. Inserting into OBL's compound the helo looses control and crashes. The Seals are not were they are supposed to be. Yet they are able to continue the mission and succeed.<br /><br />Yes, the author does disclose sensitive military information - that the administration has neutered much of their effectiveness through political correctness and excessive involvement of those who do not understand what they are doing or the need for real time decision making. There are warriors ready to do what's needed but suddenly required to make powerpoint presentations to attorneys who will decide the mission and make the rules.  Beyond this it's hard to find anything of tactical or strategic value to those who would like to convert or kill us. It's apparent that the author left a lot out of the story of the bin Laden raid to avoid some specific areas.<br /><br />Instead, the author takes us on a decade long involvement with the best of the best. If there is something disappointing about the book it is what the author does not say. More than a decade of service, 11 deployments, tens of thousands of hours of training and then it's time to leave. But there's no (zero) retirement benefits, no pension...  nothing other than the skills and friendships he developed.<br /><br />The book is also a great book on organizational culture. The absolute focus on competence and commitment to the team and an advancement process that focuses on merit. At the top of the pyramid the organized conditioning exercises disappear, those who have risen to this level can be trusted to organize their own physical conditioning. The team training never stops as each lesson learned is tested to see how it should modify the way they do things.<br /><br />My guess is that over the next few years it will become clearer why certain things were included in the book.<br /><br />This is a great read...........................
B0019KC4U4|3.0|This CD originally in 1972 is the fourth studio album from the band and is among the favorites for the fans in general. I do not think one of the best. It has beautiful music, but not ones that are considered the best known (\\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" and \\"Supper's Ready) and are the great songs on the disc. DVD has some videos of the era and the album in 5.1 enriches the work. To who does not know the band, I can not recommend as the first album to buy. Note 6 or 6.5 at most.

B005LAIGKU|3.0|\\"Premium Rush\\", the new film from director David Koepp (\\"Ghost Town\\", \\"The Secret Window\\") has a lot going for it and one major drawback. But all in all, it's a fun, edge-of-your-seat-type of entertainment and is shaping up to become an underappreciated summer treat.<br /><br />Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a NYC bike messenger, picks up a package from Nima (Jamie Chung, \\"The Real World: San Diego\\") who has gone to great lengths to secure the contents of the envelope, a movie ticket with a doodle on it. Nima is also the ex-roommate of Wilee's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), so they have a connection and she trusts Wilee more with this very precious package. The envelope must be delivered by 7pm to an address in Chinatown. No problem for Wilee. He seems to make a game out of speeding through the horrible Manhattan traffic, trying to avoid obstacles and make deliveries in a timely manner. He and Vanessa, and the rest of the bike messenger community are closely knit and look out for one another. But there is one big problem; a crooked cop, Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon, \\"Take Shelter\\", \\"\\"Revolutionary Road\\"), with a huge gambling debt, wants the envelope as well and will do just about anything to get it.<br /><br />Start the clock. Wilee has just about 90 minutes to make the delivery, weaving through the crowded streets of Manhattan. Just under 90 minutes to elude the crooked cop. Just under 90 minutes to save some lives, prevent some deaths and figure out what the hell is going on.<br /><br />Koepp, who co-wrote the screenplay (and wrote, among many others, \\"Indiana Jones 4\\", \\"War of the Worlds\\", \\"Angels and Demons\\") then puts into place a little used and difficult to pull off narrative device; he tells Wilee's story in \\"real time\\". When a filmmaker chooses to use this device, they usually do so because they want to keep the pace moving and want to heighten the suspense. But this device is rarely used because it is difficult to pull off well. It also adds an inherent problem to the narrative. If everything in the film is happening in real time, how do you establish any of the characters back stories?<br /><br />Koepp gets around these problems in a unique and interesting way. As soon as Wilee gets the package and receives his instructions, the clock starts, appearing on screen at key times. This is done to help keep us grounded in the story, but also to provide a 'ticking clock', ratcheting the tension up a couple of notches. Wilee sets off, speeding through taxis and parked cars, pedestrians and other vehicles, trying to keep one step ahead of a very determined cop who is chasing him. To get around the narrative restrictions, Koepp uses the slow moments, when Wilee is riding without incident, to turn the clock back. The clock pops up on screen and rushes back to an earlier moment illustrating another part of the narrative. When the moment is done, the clock rushes forward again and we pick up where we left off. Koepp doesn't limit this technique just to Gordon-Levitt and allows us to see key moments that occur before the time frame of this film. Basically, the director cheats on the narrative device but does so in a way that still seems natural.<br /><br />The television series \\"24\\" is a really good example of how this technique can be used successfully in an action story. But even \\"24\\" cheated. Not everything was told in real time. After commercial breaks, the time suddenly skips forward four or five minutes. What happened during those missed moments? The skill comes when the filmmakers successfully hide the inconsequential, or boring, moments in these time breaks.<br /><br />The real time device, with the clock popping up on screen probably sounds unnatural and obtrusive. Because the film is very graphic heavy, the ticking clock becomes part of the overall look and blends in more. Early on, as Wilee rides through the insane traffic, trying to make his delivery on time, he is suddenly confronted by a huge truck blockinghis way. He looks at three different alternatives, trying to figure out which way to go. As he does this, we take on his point-of-view and watch as his mind plots a course through the various obstacles, complete with a yellow arrow and a glimpse at the outcome of each route. As soon as he figures out which way to go, he speeds through.<br /><br />\\"Premium Rush\\" is a plot-driven film; we are watching Wilee navigating various obstacles to make his delivery on time. He has to get from Point A to Point B in a short amount of time or something really bad could happen. The little flashback moments I mentioned earlier help to provide a little back-story to the characters, but these moments illustrate why the characters make decisions that will affect the plot. In doing this, the filmmakers establish \\"Rush\\" as an action film, a film meant to solely create thrills. And Koepp does this well, so I have no complaints. But I usually prefer character-driven stories.<br /><br />But this plot-driven story robs Gordon-Levitt of the opportunity to create another full-fledged character. He is a fine actor and has created some very memorable films. But he also falls victim to \\"Hollywood-itis\\". Wilee is, for Gordon-Levitt, the equivalent of Meryl Streep in \\"River Wild\\". In both instances, a very good actor takes an action movie role in an effort to increase their profile, make them more bankable and push them into another level of stardom. In Gordon-Levitt's case, he seems destined to headline a big budget Hollywood no-brainer; \\"Premium Rush\\" and the upcoming \\"Looper\\" seem like stepping stones to that goal. When I think of the actor, I think of \\"(500) Days of Summer\\", \\"The Lookout\\", \\"50/50\\" and \\"Inception\\". I want to see him in more films like these. We have enough big budget no-brainer films starring over paid 'actors' and don't need to corrupt another fine actor and change him.<br /><br />Michael Shannon, who has been in a ton of films but received a lot of positive press for \\"Take Shelter\\" and \\"Revolutionary Road\\", plays the crooked cop Bobby Monday. Unfortunately, he chews up the scenery, playing the role way over the top. And his seemingly unnatural ability to stay in pursuit of Wilee only makes him seem like the Terminator. Because his character is so unnatural, it makes the film seem more cartoonish than it should. And that isn't a great thing for a film like this, a film trying so hard to make everything seem real.<br /><br />The whole story behind the movie ticket is a little overly complex and almost seems unreal. I am sure Koepp has based this on a real practice, but because it is so complicated, it seems out of place. Hitchcock always used a MacGuffin in his films, something the bad guys were after but had little actual connection to the story. It was the reason for the actions of the villain, but once the hero got involved, the interactions between the two sides became the film. In \\"North By Northwest\\", the MacGuffin is the little statue Vandamm wants to buy at the auction. It contains microfilm, but what that microfilm contains is of little consequence. Because Koepp gives so much emphasis to this movie ticket, and what it means, it becomes an integral part of the film and makes everything seem a little off balance.<br /><br />Koepp has created an exciting, interesting and well-made film with a major flaw. It is well-worth a bargain matinee or DVD rental.his way. He looks at three different alternatives, trying to figure out which way to go.

And the small Mob that recorded Omert&agrave; is: Russell Allen - vocals (most known for Symphony X); Mike Portnoy - drums (most known for Dream Theater); and Mike Orlando - guitar/bass (most known for...um...playing guitar and bass on Adrenaline Mob's first record).<br /><br />5 out of 11 stand out tracks on Omert&agrave; are the album's first 3 kick-off songs called Undaunted, Psychosane (in which Mike Orlando's Zakk Wylde influence loudly shreds), and Indifferent (that is also worth checking the video out for on YouTube). In the middle of the album, Believe Me is a driving Hard Rocker as well. And finally, an \\"interesting\\" track is the cover of Duran Duran's Come Undone with guest vocalist Lzzy Hale (of Halestorm). The other 6 songs probably won't last very long on my iPod. (8/21/2013: SEE EDIT BELOW.)<br /><br />A lot of criticism of Omert&agrave; stems from Dream Theater's and Symphony X's fan base that justifiably expected a veteran Progressive Metal disk but got more of a straight up Hard Rock album. It was clearly a deliberate move and desire by Portnoy and Allen to record a Rock record, not another Prog record. And it sounds pretty good to me. I think that they'll gain some new fans with Omert&agrave;; and I don't think that they'll lose any due to the change in direction. But Dream Theater and Symphony X fans should listen to a few songs before purchasing this disk, because (some of) it may not be palatable to the Progressive Metal ear.<br /><br />Since recording the record the boys have been on tour with a couple of different guys to help out, such as Fozzy/Stuck Mojo guitarist Rich Ward and Fozzy bassist Paul Di Leo. But just recently Disturbed announced their \\"indefinite hiatus,\\" so for the time being it seems that Disturbed bassist John Moyer has found a new home with Adrenaline Mob.<br /><br />All in all Omert&agrave; is a pretty good Rock record. If I had the chance to do it over, I would download just the standouts versus the whole disk. But who knows, my standouts might not be yours, so final word: Give Omert&agrave; a try if you like Hard Rock.<br /><br />EDIT: 8/21/2013 - A year later it turns out that this ENTIRE disk is one of my most played on my iPod; in fact, one of the most stand-out tracks for me is Hit the Wall which I didn't even mention when I originally wrote this review. I guess my point is that this album really grew on me and became one of the top Hard Rock records in my collection. I can't believe that after my first few listens I originally wrote that only 5 out of 11 tracks stood out...I have never had such a wrong first impression of an album. So it's about time I got back here and fixed this sorry review. Changed rating from 3 stars to 5.b.<br /><br />All in all Omertà is a pretty good Rock record.

B000FCK8ZK|3.0|Well, I've read the book after having seen all the 6 first seasons. I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed by the book even though you understand slightly more about the character personality.<br />But believe me the TV series is very well adapted.<br />Back to the book, I would say if you're a Dexter fan you surely want to read it (and probably read all the Jeff Lindsay books)  just to have more info about him. Otherwise don't bother reading and definitely go for the Showtime's Dexter.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is totally awesome. It kind of reminds me of Angry Birds though. You should make a robot era. Maybe with aliens. I think zombies would be really cool. Who doesn't like hitting zombies with stuff?I hope that you will make some these things.
B0025T65GC|5.0|This is the first of four releases in a series by The Devin Townsend Project released in 2009.<br /><br />I read, \\"Over two years, Townsend wrote over 60 songs, and found that they fit into \\"four distinct styles\\".In March 2009, Townsend announced his plans for a four-album series called the Devin Townsend Project,with the goal of clarifying his musical identity and being \\"accountable\\" for the persona he projects to the public. Ki, the first album of the Devin Townsend Project, is written to \\"set the stage\\" for the subsequent albums. The word ki represents the Japanese concept of \\"life force\\" (氣, \\"ki\\").Townsend chose the name as an homage to the 1981 Kitarō album of the same name, which he \\"loved as a kid\\".[5]<br /><br />His past \\"Strapping Young Lad\\" releases were characterized as progressive heavy metal. I believe \\"Ki\\", the first of his four releases under the project breaks the mold, while the three following releases fall back into this genre from time to time, \\"Ghost\\" being much more subdued.<br /><br />Townsend explained his musical style, saying \\"yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, but that is not all that I listen to, and that is not all that I want to play.\\"<br /><br />The music is unpredictable, extremely creative, intense and very gripping at times. It builds, builds, builds then drops you into a sea of tranquility. I enjoy how his acoustic guitar runs through the whole project so clear, concise and so simplistic, very hypnotizing, taking you away then waking you up as he cascades off into another direction.<br /><br />A subtle evolution of a very talented musician and producer. A performer who plays from the heart without any \\"BS\\" clouding his direction. When it flows, it flows and this production is a tsunami of greatness.<br /><br />BTW, Devin Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician and record producer.
B004GYY714|5.0|this app was great!! I loved the one direction radio station cud all it plays is one direction with little to no commercials. the only thing I didn't like was that my fab local station was not able to connect with this app. overall this app was PhenomiNIALL!!!!!  (one direction 4ever!!)
B008LZHA3G|3.0|Ok folks, I'm gonna grab the third rail quick and hard.<br /><br />Bob Dylan's new album, \\"Tempest\\", is a disappointment. As a lifelong Dylan fan, I'm a home-field supporter for all his work. I loved recent efforts like \\"Modern Times\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\". Despite Dylan's increasing vocal troubles, these were intelligent albums with truly great songs that had tons of energy and dynamics. But \\"Tempest\\", despite deep, moving lyrics (which separates it from the muddy and wandering \\"Together Through Life\\"), is an album that is often musically monotonous and plodding.<br /><br />It's not that it couldn't have been great - all the raw materials are here. The players are awesome. And yeh, Dylan is nothing but a vocal growler these days, but he knows how to work within his limitations - ultimately this isn't the problem either.  The problem is a familiar one for many artists: Dylan shouldn't be producing himself.  He is formulaic, depending on recurring riffs and grooves, asking for little from his musicians. Other than a few notable moments in \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" (which the video of the song seizes on as well), there are few changes and dynamics to keep the listener's attention.<br /><br />This is most fully obvious in the title song \\"Tempest\\" which is an epic telling of the sinking of the Titanic. There are Celtic players and a nice melody, but like the great ship itself it doesn't survive the journey. Dylan's vocal syncopations are basic, almost childlike. That internal drumbeat that usually makes his vocals so unique is simply missing here. And the band... what are they waiting for? Are they afraid to play? Are they intimidated? Have they been told to lay back?  The breaks between sets of verses are calling for emotion and an instrumental  jump into the foreground - a jump that never arrives. It's as if they are a Celtic \\"session\\" jazz band that just works its way through the changes. What a huge missed opportunity \\"Tempest\\" is.<br /><br />Bob Dylan is an iconic artist,but that iconism should not lead us to making excuses for the man when he misses the mark. Isn't that the very worst thing we can do as fans, become \\"Yes Men\\"? \\"Yeh Bob, you were GREAT, dude!\\"<br /><br />There is no reason at all that \\"Tempest\\" could not have risen up to the artistic heights of a \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" or \\"Highway 61\\". Think of the work Johnny Cash did with Rick Rubin in the last years of his life. Far from some pleasant coda into that great goodnight, these \\"American Recordings\\" are rightly considered a career highlight, no less important than any other material he recorded at any time in his life. Together they created a catalog of amazing songs that will stand the test of time. Which version of \\"One\\" really is the reference version for all time - U2's, or Cash's? It's a tough question, isn't it? So should it be for Dylan. But if we are honest, nothing on this record will be so memorable. Dylan  is a man of many talents, but producing himself is not one of them. He needs to find a sympathetic figure who knows his frailties, but who can also challenge him and fill in the blanks that Dylan is frequently missing.<br /><br />\\"Tempest\\" is not a terrible album - it's worth having, and it has its moments. \\"Duquesne Whistle\\", \\"Pay In Blood\\" and in particular \\"Long And Wasted Years\\" stand out. But it could have been so much more.
030799077X|5.0|Bought used but would pass for brand new and possibly never used.  Received book within time predicted when order was placed.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|This set was way better than I expected. I loved the Forever album and i thought without Al Dimeola It would not be the same. Well.. it is better. The pacing and the solos are awesome and the dvd is very good also. i highly recommend this set for any true jazz fans.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This flash light is so powerful you can use it as a spot light for hunting!  And it has 5 intensity settings as well as strobe and morris code setting.  Great flash light.  I wish they were not so expensive.  And it will irritate your eyes so do not shine it in anyones eyes!
B0028ER4QE|5.0|Everything was perfect. Could not be happier. So stoaked!! It's the Doors! They don't need explaining! It's the Doors damnit!!
B004S2BXCA|5.0|The book is aptly named, as it provides a path for the aspiring card magician to follow.  It moves in detailed instruction through simple basics on to more complex maneuvers, with each chapter building on what you've already learned.  It provides a number of creative tricks, but more importantly, it equips you with the pieces you need to construct your own.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds and I currently play Angry Birds, Rio, Space, Season, Friends (on Facebook), on Chrome browser and another as well. Yes that's seven different versions and they are all fun.:<br /><br />Note: I got Angry Birds ad-free edition free on an Amazon special to see what the differences are from the free version and as a result of not having to deal with all of the ads especially the full screen ads like in Angry Birds Space, I will consider the ad-free editions for the rest of the Angry Birds now that I tried this one.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|I watched the movie on tv and I am glad I didn't buy it. My main point of criticism is that all the props (e.g. books) are English books. It bugged me to see that he reads an English book to her and she learned writing with an English book (they even mention in the movie that he only learns Latin and Greek at school). They suppose to be Germans - than use German books. Otherwise the movie is alright.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love it. It is much more of a challenge then other games without being discouraging. I can't wait for more levels.
B0085HWZDK|4.0|Great Blu Ray of Robert Plant and Group playing some great music. The only down side is it took me 15 minutes or so to get the sound to be decent through adjusting several settings on my system. Not sure why the producers didn't take more care on getting the sound correct. Once fixed, this is very enjoyable and one that I will play for a long time. It doesn't hurt that Patty Griffin is very cute!
B004W1GEBC|5.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE, EXCITING AND MARLON BRANDO AND KARL MALDEN ARE GREAT, SLIM PICKENS TOO, THANKS, WAS EASY TO WATCH
B00992CF6W|5.0|For months now all my friends have been talking about minecraft and how awesome it is. Now I know why. It is AMAZING. One of the best games ever. I would TOTALLY recommend this to everybody. It is the most expensive game I've ever bought on the app store,  but is MORE THAN WORTH IT!!! I downloaded it the second I saw it was finally avaliable. Then I played it for hours. Then I deleted Block Story Lite from my kindle. Minecraft is so much better. Worth every penny.
0525953728|4.0|As a US Army veteran, I can appreciate all of the hard physical elements these Seals have to endure during training, and in combat. This book depicts a very real sense of what the Seals during the missions, but doesn't reveal anything \\"top secret\\"; I am not understanding why the US Gov't is having a hard time with this book.<br /><br />Like a lot of reviewers already mentioned, the first half of the book details Mark and the Seals' previous missions, and then the pace of the book picks up very fast when it was learned UBL's location.  Recounting previous missions, and detailing the events that changed everything seems to be a formula for most Military books; like Michael Durant's book, \\"In the Company of Heroes\\". [[ASIN:B008T27D9M In the Company of Heroes by Hartov, Michael J. Durant with Steven published by Thorndike Press Hardcover]]<br /><br />I already had an idea what this book was going to be like, but there were a few surprises in the book as well.<br /><br />This was a book that had to be written, and I am very glad it was somebody who was there and gave us a very real story of what happened.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Have to force close very often on ATRIX. Shame, what I can play is pretty fun. I hope they will update it later to fix this issue.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|This film, if I can even call it a film, is so... completely stupid. I planned on buying it, just for the 3D and just to add it to the collection. As if you couldn't already tell from the title that this would be stupid. But, I felt why not give it try and paying $5 thanks to Walmart for miss marking it, seemed like I had nothing to really lose.<br />They tried to be funny, wasn't funny. They tried to make it scary, it wasn't. The saddest part is you would think from the title that there would naked girls running all over the place. To be honest there were, but there was more in the first than this. And this is coming from a gay man, a movie with DD in the title you would expect something more... DD.<br />The acting, was worst than anything I have ever seen. I would have turned off the movie during that part when the cop from the first was fighting with that ugly guy that was driving the party boat from the first. Then... \\"Bring me my legs\\"... he has shotguns for legs, that seem to have unlimited ammo.<br /><br />I always thought, that if there were to be a sequel to the first that they would some what follow the sequel to the original. Flying Piranhas, sure it would be kind of stupid, but nothing like this.<br />I would say, Redbox this movie if you have to see this. Unless you can get it below $10 for 3D, $5 for just blu ray... $1 for DVD. I wouldn't buy it.
0823023494|5.0|Tom's book is awesome it give you a lot of helpful tips to created awesome character with your personal ideas but with the correct steps to do so, just what any animation student needs or anyone the loves to created characters for any kind of stuff
B007TNS6JI|3.0|it could be better,  I do enjoy playing just need more of a challange,though.. when the upgrade happens they should lower the amount for the extra keys.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a good continuation from the first book, this book is a page turner.  I cannot wait to read the last book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game because its entertaining and time consumimg, it helps when I 'm waiting at the doctor 's office I just love it!
0345803485|5.0|Love love this series.. Story was not rushed and the sex was HOT!!!! Definitely recommend. I will say it is not for every one though.
B008E374PO|5.0|Bought this for my husband. Great sound with a very clever mix. Love the collaboration with other familiar artists. Even the grandkids enjoy it. (with a few minor exceptions!)
0345803485|1.0|After hearing about this story (?) I reserved it at the library.  I was the 300th or more person to reserve it.  I got it in a month.  This leads me to believe that many persons began the book, then in wonderment did not continue.  This is truly the worst book I have ever read.  I will not repeat the details which are contained in other reviews but I could not finish.  I had no curiosity as to what happens to the characters, the sex, the story.  I have no intention to read the trilogy.  Where are the editors of this publisher?  This is a book meant to titillate a teenager.  The language is elementary.  Come on readers, you and all the other reviewers are a thousand times more intelligent and interesting.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Does not want to open on the nexus 7. Hard to give it negative stars for that and hard to give it positive stars.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like this app, it is cool and the puzzles are really pretty and some of them are free. I didn't have any problems with how it worked.
B0063IH60K|4.0|predictable but good waste of time needs to be harder you cant get bored fast I like the card designs would be great to create original designs I really have nothing else to say and bate rating these games
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This trilogy was absolutely wonderful. Kept me intrigued thru out the books. If you like fantasy books then this set of books are for you. Just beware once you start them you won't want to put them down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is simply amazing! It was very hard to put this book down. I think the book is better than the movie. This book sucks you in from the very beginning. A must read!!
B008CP93S0|1.0|The Wanderlust- movie  Would not recommend this to anyone.  It was vulgar and really not something I would want to see  again.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire as well and I have to uninstall and reinstall weekly.  Today that won't even work.  Fix it already!
B008KMHFJY|4.0|Enjoyed it very much, Travis is easy to like even if he can be a bit OTT definitely worth a read.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It is a great story, well made, well acted.  We enjoy it very much and share it among family and friends
B009329Y30|5.0|Movie-review The Lucky One -  very moving, acting great, made you feel as if you were there.  Would highly recommend it to any adult.  Would watch it again.<br /><br />Nellie
B005HP2J66|4.0|I would love to buy this as I have heard wonderful comments about it,but without subtitles or closed-captions(there is a big difference for hearing-impaired people)I have to pass it by and hope that someday it will be re-released by a company that knows the value of subtitles and that share of the market that rely on them to enjoy film at home.<br />Thank you,<br />Tim Jaqua<br />Bristol,VT
B007GCY8FS|5.0|My yearly wait for another Jack Reacher novel was worth it.  While 'Wanted Man' took a different course from the series it is nevertheless highly entertaining. I do want to tell Mr Child that I missed the head butts and forearm bashes. It is a style I personally enjoyed in close encounters.
B005TQAI6G|1.0|I'm so disappointed. I'm a fan of her since Baby one more time. In this DVD u can easily see she can't move anymore. We all know that she can't sing live but now she can't even dance too. So, what else she can do? The true Britney is gone since before Gimme more but this is worse. I'm buying this for my collection but i finally know that is just a trash.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|This is yet another solid release from this band. A couple of the songs are a bit different, but by and large, if you already own one of their other CD's and you like that, you'll like this.
0812406273|3.0|Good easy reader with five separate stories about the same character. Pictures are cute and imaginative and help with the story line. The stories seem a bit silly to me. That owl isn't very wise. However, he is a likable character, and at age 70 I certainly can't claim to have a primary grade sense of humor. I confess that I bought the book to go along with a couple of toy owls that I wanted to gift.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Stock Jelly Bean - Every time I try to openit says &quot;stopped working&quot; - Fix so I can rate the game itself.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This is an incredible, sublime, evocative and visually stunning work of accessable fine art. Before Baraka, nothing compared to Koyannisqatsi, and until now, nothing compared to Baraka. If you've not seen those two films, you should! I've been waiting for two years to see this film and it was worth the wait. With larger screen HD Televisions, the afore mentioned masterpieces, and this one, when released on DVD, will be some of the most beautiful films you will ever experience at home. That said, if Samsara is playing in a theatre near you, GO SEE IT ON A HUGE WIDE SCREEN NOW!!! If you are looking for mindless entertainment, skip Samsara, but if you want something that will get under your skin, tap into your soul and remind you of who and what we are on the grandest scale, you won't be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but it to much I play it on the I pad but this is just to much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Some readers and staunch feminists may bristle at the abrupt 180 degree turn this book takes mid-way through, but others should delight in the deliciously twisted paths this novel treads.  The ending also feels a bit flat after Flynn builds up some serious momentum, so readers anticipating some grand comeuppence or well-deserved just desserts may be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|3.0|over all very happy, it has been very useful with my day to day activities. with getting around and being prepared
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app.  Wish it had the email this to a friend option - but other than that it is a great app!
B004SBX112|5.0|This app is wonderful, my son loves angry birds, the free version had ads that would pop up in the top right corner making it difficult to see what you were trying to aim at.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great Bible for a free version. It offers various versions of the scripture and some are downloadable for offline viewing.
B0075CPRGS|5.0|This was one of my favorite bands back when I was in highschool 30 years ago.  Of course I give it 5 stars. Kind of cool they give the cleaned up studio version and a raw version of most of the tracks. Oh wait... this is a review.. \\"A roller coaster ride of spills and thrills that left me breathless and wanting more\\" (smile)
