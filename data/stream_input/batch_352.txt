B00006SFLV|2.0|the show it self gets five stars. the dvd collection has very poor quality. it looks like it was done on a vcr at someone's house and burned on dvd. there was not even any liner notes. it looked like a bootleg when i received it. i loved the show and that is the only reason i an keeping it. NOT WORTH THE 70.00+ they are charging for it. hope this helps!
B000003TAR|5.0|Kurt Cobain was a genius.  His lyrics move me, they captivate me.  I loved Nirvana's first album, Bleach.  In Utero was the first album that truly revisited the roots of true Nirvana music.  The off-beat tunes on this album will push some away, but the poppy and stirring chords will keep most listening.  My favorite song on In Utero was All Apologies, not because of the incredibly moving lyrics, even though they are spectacular, but rather the vibe the song gives off.  Kurt had obviously been contemplating suicide before this song was written because it seems to be a farewell, an epitaph if you will, to all of his fans and people he loved who had not yet betrayed him yet, although this does leave a short list.  I realize this theory does not sound very Cobain-esque, but maybe he couldn't help himself and maybe he just wanted us to realize that he still loved the music, he just couldn't take the people within the business any longer.
B00008WT5C|5.0|When asked to pick the best AC/DC album, it's a tough call for me between POWERAGE and LTBR.  Although POWERAGE is my personal fave, LTBR is right on it's heals.  <BR>No other AC/DC album has the same loud, obnoxious, nasty guitar sound that LTBR has.  Period.  It's evident from the very first track \\"Go Down\\" to the very last track, the classic \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\" and on everything in between that Angus and Malcolm just plugged in, turned it to 11, and went for the jugular.  If there's every been a good argument that AC/DC are a heavy metal band (which they whole-heartedly deny), LTBR (both the album and song) is that argument.<BR>Not only is the guitar sound great, but the songs on a whole are magnificent.  Bon's writing continues to grow from the earlier albums, combining sex, drugs, and rock n' roll with a good dose of humourous storytelling.  Again, \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" is a prime example, as is the title song.  Who else but Bon could pull off a shag story about a 19 stone woman so eloquently!?!  To quote Angus, Bon truly was a \\"gutter poet!\\"  In addition to the lyrical content, the hooks on this album are HUGE!  The title track and \\"Dog Eat Down\\" are excellent showcases of the boys ability to work out some of the catchiest licks in rock history.<BR>Bottom line, this is an essential album for any AC/DC fan (or any rock fan in general).  If you're just starting out, you can't go wrong with this one.  If you're an old timer, like me, this remaster brings the sound to an even better level, so even if you have other copies of LTBR, it's well worth the effort to get this one!
0385504209|5.0|Brown does a fantastic job integrating the mythical worlds of religion and art history in this brilliant thriller.  Although the characterizations are more of a sketch than fully realized, they work remarkably well as a scaffolding for the *real* substance this book has to offer.<br />Certainly his research has resonated, and caused all the zealots and religious whackos to come seething out of the woodwork like the worms they are.  Feeling threatened, are we?<br />Ultimately, it's the simple logic behind this piece that makes it so powerful, something almost completely missing from the foundations of modern religion.
0060012218|5.0|It's been about five years since I have been this excited about a book *after* reading it! As a character in the book book would say, \\"Docious!\\"
B000089RVR|2.0|I found this CD a disappointment.  The meandering lyrics and melodies in most of the songs just didn't carry me.  This is an example of why it is better to buy a track rather than a CD.  The background track was really uninspiring in an age when music is so easily built into the song.
B000002WYT|4.0|This is a good cd by a good jam band.  I dont like the number of instruments incorporated into Dave's music lately but it's still pretty pure jam music.  Dave isn't the best jam band, if you like this cd but feel the same way I do about the clutter of instruments in it, I recommend the following bands instead:<br />Dispatch (Great, pure jam band)<BR>Keller Williams (Also a good jammer)<BR>Phish (The best, in my opinion, of all jam bands)<BR>String Cheese Incident (A good and also slightly different approach to jammin')<br />And even though he has nothin' at all to do with jam bands whatsoever, I gotta recommend the man:<br />ANYTHING BY JIMI HENDRIX!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have been waiting for this album for 6 years and it is well worth the wait. Every song is emotional, moving and beautiful. The past 6 years have been an emotional roller coaster for Sarah because she lost her Mother and gave birth to her first child right around the same time. You can hear both her pain and her joy in all the songs. Even if your not a Sarah fan this is one of the best albums in the past year.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I thought this movie had some of the most amazing fight scenes I have ever seen.  Although anything else that happened in the movie I was totally clueless too, I think the awesome fight sequences made up for the useless rambling that many of the characters did, describing the matrix and what it is.  Totally worth seeing.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I don't think that most people would dispute that Sarah McLachlan has a gorgeous and original voice that is both sensual and heavenly at the same time.  It has been a long break for Sarah, and I (for one) am hugely impressed by her newest release.  Afterglow hearkens back to her Fumbling days with a more folksy and lush sound.  Unlike Surfacing, which disposed of much of her harmonic vocal layers, Afterglow has that trademark Sarah sound of beautifully layered vocals.  In fact, the song &quot;Answer&quot; has a bit of an Enya feel with its intense harmonies.  All of the melodies are lovely and subtle in their own ways.  Lyrically, Sarah is at the top of her game.<BR>The song &quot;Time&quot; is probably one of the best songs that I've heard in years.  It is totally moving.<br />Although Sarah's been through some serious life changes she continues to write incredible songs.  And the voice...its like a cold drink of water after wandering through the desert for years.<br />WAY TO GO SARAH!!!
0385504209|2.0|&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is an incredibly bad book. It's badly plotted, the writing and dialogue are asinine beyond belief. It's the sort of book where the lead character burbles nonsensical, leaden exposition about the goddess figure in Medieval art to his accomplice as they're fleeing from the cops.<br />Dan Brown isn't the first to rabbit on with this deathly boring claptrap about the Templars and Jesus and the Grail, etc., just the most recent. But neither he nor any of the other conspiracy-obsessed fools can tell us why, if the knowledge that these secret brotherhoods and societies possess is so &quot;powerful&quot;, they're so impotent. If they actually knew anything, why don't they come out with and say it? And what difference would it make if yet another group came out with yet another religious theory? Throw it on the heap with the other 100,000,000 wacko theories about gods and messiahs and ressurections and Jesus and Vishnu and werewolves for all the difference it would make.<br />&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is nothing more than a shockingly bad airport novel. The fact that the author seems to take it seriously is no reason for anyone who actually cares about books and literature to do the same.
6304602979|5.0|The is one of my all time fav's. It's sorta like a violent, exaggerated modern day version of a fairy tale. So much happens in this movie. Something dramatic happens in every scene. It's nutty, it's violent, it's witty, it's shocking, it's sad, it's romantic, and entertaining. Action packed violence can never be not found in a tarantino film. I cant believe it's 10 years old already. You couldnt tell. Gary Oldman, hahaha, who plays the pimp who thinks he is black, talks black, and acts black. My favorite scene was when Clarence paid a little visit to his new wife's former pimp, Oldman. Course it didnt end up with a friendly chat. lol. I guess he thought it was white boy day! hehe. I give this classic 5 stars.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|To put it simply, this set is THE set to own for Alien fans.  Even if you own the Legacy boxset or other releases of the films, this set is a must own.  In this set, not only do you get remastered versions of the films, you get over 40 hours of behind-the-scenes materials, including test footage, outtakes, documentaries, film commentaries from 3 of the four directors (Scott, Cameron, and Jeanut), and a plethora of galleries that expose in-depth the Alien saga.
B000000W5L|5.0|-<BR>History: The Rolling Stones began calling themselves the \\"World's Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Band\\" in the late `60s, and few disputed the claim.  The Stones' music, based on Chicago blues, has continued to sound vital through the decades, and the Stones' attitude of flippant defiance, now aged into wry bemusement, has come to seem as important as their music.<br />Review: Painfully rough and rusty.  Lyrics are yelled, whispered, cried, and moaned-but not sung, in the way most define singing.  But beneath this, the album is richly developed and ripe, full of raw and pure spiritual energy.  (I believe `Tumble and Dice' to be the purest rock song.) Nothing was dried out-these songs ooze with feeling-joy, lust, regret, redemption.  The Stones aggressively seduced their muses and demons, they delighted their gods, which sometime seem Pagan, and other times Christian.  If you want to have your whole being rocked, moved, shoved, jammed, delighted, it will happen here.<br />Importance:  Probably too rough and too pure for most-once you tire of pop/catchy/soulless music, you will find your redemption here.  You must be alive to love this and to those who are, those who feel the pain and joy, this is an, or the, important rock album.  To those overcivilized, those citizens, those respectable-you will be dissatisfied. <BR>-
B00006IUL7|5.0|The movie begins with great scenic views of beautiful Atlanta. Two LAPD detectives are sent there to solve a homicide case. A teen murder has been committed. Anyways, as the first murder suspect is getting confronted Al Pacino kills his partner by mistake but decides to put the blame on the suspect of the teen murder. And by doing this he gets his insomnia and can never get back to sleep.<br />A great movie by all means. Robin Williams as good as always.<br />A must see
0792140346|5.0|Ok, first off, I watched this movie when it came to theatres in 96, and I thought the ending was so messed up, but I was only 14. Young Ed Norton (one of my favorite actors) was outstanding. Going from stuttering innocent little alter boy Arron Stampler, to diabolical, foul mouthed, ruthless Roy. The movie had suspense, some humor, originality, and a surprise ending, which entertains you from beginning to end. And in real life this could happen. That is why it's hard to prove insanity because they get off so easily in the court of law. Richard Gere deserved an award for this film too. Playing the part of a naive and optimistic attorney. I felt like the end defeated the whole purpose of the beginning and middle, but hell i didnt expect it. It was a well thought out unexpected twist. It's a great movie, and it's been on tnt like every night. If you wanna see the actual movie with all the adulterated scenes left in, rent it.
0156027321|5.0|I found Life of Pi phenomenal.  From the get go Martel addresses some highly philosophical issues in colloquial terms- a truly remarkable feature.  As the novel progresses the story draws  you in, at the same time forcing you to evaluate your place in life.  And as the novel concludes I found myself placed in the settings that Martel describes.  Wonderfully done, I recommend this novel to everyone.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Now I was really pumped about this one because Marvel was on such a role.  But than this one hit.  I was incredibly dissapointed with this one.  I almost litterally fell asleep during it.  This one did the complete opposite of the 80's marvel blunders, and that was focus too much on story.<br />The plot of the movie is that Bruce Banner gets involved in an incident involving Gamma Radiation.  What we discovered earlier is that his father injected him with a serum that he was experimenting with when Bruce was a babe.  After the Gamma incident the serum kicks in and when Bruce gets pissed he turns into a very cartoony looking hulk.  From there the military wants<br />him to be stopped and his Father wants to find out how it happened.  In the end his father also mutates into a creature that can absorb the elemnts and the hulk fights the monstrosity in and overly CGI battle.<br />Overall this movie is pretty poor.  In fact the only guy who I knew loved it was one who loves Ang Lee films and saw it as an artistic masterpiece.  I think he was stoned at the time.  Overall this movie is not very good.
B000063COX|5.0|As many of the other great metal bands through the last 20-30 years, Iron Maiden in my opinion never surpassed the magical riffs and epic sound of their debut album, despite of many descent tries in the next two decades after the release of this album. This album defines the sound of Iron Maiden, which they have been loyal to through the almost 25 years they have been in the metal scene now.  There are no weak tracks on this album, from the blistering clear guitar sound on the first track Prowler, to the classic finale with the Iron Maiden track. The albums first single Running free, are of course also among the classics. But the real treasure of this album are two tracks you seldom here Maiden playing live, and never make it to their greatest hits collections, for some reason: Phantom of the Opera and Strange World. Phantom of the Opera takes you through an epic journey with fantastic vocals by Maidens original lead singer Paul Di'anno, and magnificent guitar solos and beautiful melodic parts by guitarists Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton. Strange World is a melancholic, beautiful ballad which sound Maiden have never been able to reproduce. The album is worth buying for these two tracks alone, but because you get 7 other goods tracks and the original Maiden wibe with the package, any classic metal fan with a little self-respect can't afford not to enrich his record collection with this classic record. You'll never regret buying this!
B00005B74X|5.0|This to me is the last \\"real\\" JA album. Marty Balin left the following year, and the band's subsequent output (BARK, LONG JOHN SILVER and a poor live album) were just precursors to the inferior Jefferson Starship phase. This album is warm (Marty's beautiful vocal on Jorma's \\"Turn My Life Down\\" is one of his best), chilling (every time Grace opens her mouth, especially on the masterpieces \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" and \\"Hey Frederick\\"), majestic (Paul's \\"We Can Be Together\\", the best of his leftist anthems; \\"Good Shepherd\\" with Jorma's regal wah wah; and especially \\"Wooden Ships\\", which is to me seven of the most amazing minutes of music ever), funny (Spencer Dryden's parody of pop stardom, \\"Song For All Seasons\\", and \\"The Farm\\" a sendup of the back-to-the-land movement that was big with the hippies in '69) and bizarre (the aforementioned Slick tunes and the weird little organ version of the Russian folk tune \\"Meadowlands\\", complete with goofy background talking). Overall an eclectic, dense, challenging work, the only trouble I have with VOLUNTEERS is the deep backseat taken by Marty Balin. His one songwriting credit are the lyrics to the title track, which was pretty pedestrian compared to the MC5's \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" or even Buffalo Springfield's \\"For What It's Worth\\". Marty would return, front and center, to the Starship in a few years' time, but on this album--except for his beautiful singing on \\"Turn My Life Down\\" and \\"Wooden Ships\\"--he's sorely missed.
0226264211|5.0|It is funny that the negative review came from a fellow Brazilian. As someone that lived there for 25 years, I can tell you that if the Brazilian people and its government understood the message of Friedman's book the country would not be in the deplorable position it is (and it has ever been). It is not the corporations that will look over the people, it is the people who will look over themselves, and use the corporations to achieve their goals. The real problem is when government intervenes, and people think that is the right way to do things, since they are &quot;entitle&quot; to this and that. It is because of people like you, dear Brazilian, that the country is what it is.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|If I read one more strokes review where the reviewer actually<BR>thinks its still clever and original to say &quot;Is this it?&quot; in <BR>reference to the new album I will probably vomit... anyway,<BR>just had to get that off my chest, the album is not amazing but<BR>its good enough to be worthy of your dollar, key highlight is the<BR>infectious melodies which I can't tell if they are all ripoffs<BR>or just a couple, sound great though...
0375823360|5.0|Oh my gosh, there arent enough words to describe how electrifying, thrilling, heart-wrenching, and wonderful these books are. I began reading them when I was 12, and now at 16, it still brings fresh tears to my eyes when I read it. (And believe me, that is a RARE occasion!) I was a bit thrown off at first by \\"The Golden Compass\\"(Book I) because there were so many new things being put into my mind, so it may require a second read for some folks, but PLEASE don't let this stop you early in the book! I know too many people who have said they \\"didn't get it\\", and put it back on the shelf. The series has a gripping and breathtaking plot, but also many deeper meanings. And its only fantasy either. As I have gotten older, I have come across more and more facts that he refers to and basis his story off of. For example, I took an astronomy class, and found out that scientists don't know what a huge bunch of outer space matter is.(They have only discovered around 10% if I am correct.) They even refer to it as \\"Dark Matter\\"! The books are also very involved with the conflict between science and christianity. Some people may be disturbed or biased against the series for this reason, but I personally loved the way it gave me new veiws and thoughts on my beliefs on creation and God. All of these things I had never found exciting before suddenly came alive with the magic of Phillip Pullmans's writing. I HIGHLY HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, andventure and romance. When the much-anticipated \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix\\" FINALLY came out, I found it was really quite dull compared to \\"His Dark Materials\\" Trilogy. (But I still loved it anyways!!!) So Please, I'm really begging you, TRY THIS BOOK! You won't regret it! I wish everyone I knew would listen to me when I tell them to go read it. Its sure to captivate you! Enjoy the books and I hope I helped you guys out in deciding what new book to buy!
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|This DVD is next best to having attended the 2003 concert in person. The concert shown was played in Sydney, Australia, including 2 sets of encores (the playlist was identical to what I saw during a concert in North America on the same tour). I felt like I was experiencing the concert all over again. <br />During the concert, there are lots of close ups, meaning you'll even see the beads of sweat on the bandmembers' faces. There are several seemingly 'private moments' caught on tape, when the members of the band look particularly thoughtful or serene during songs. The audio is 100% authentic to the point that a few minor musical/sound glitches remain. (You want to feel like you were really at the concert, right?!) <br />Visually, I found the film really well done, artistic even. Some parts of the concert are shown in black &amp; white, others in color. There are some scenes that are shown in a kind of hybrid, with most of the shot appearing in black and white and highlights brought out in colour. It's quite stunning to the eye.<br />Another feature of the DVD that I really enjoyed was the tour diary which is a behind the scenes look at the band's travels. This gave me a chance to see a side of Coldplay I didn't know at all. The bandmembers seem to still be really close friends in spite of their rapid rise to fame. Some of the candid moments caught in the tour diary include a super-fast impromptu version of Trouble (it's funny!), the guys doing radio interviews, rescuing a kitten from the ceiling of their backstage dressing room (!) and much more. I had a smile plastered on my face for the entire tour diary. I enjoyed it at least as much as the concert portion of the DVD itself.<br />All together, the DVD (which includes a live concert CD) is a wise investment for any Coldplay fan. You'll be enjoying this one for years to come.
B00000K2SC|1.0|As we fast approach the release of &quot;Matrix: Revolutions&quot; I find myself amazed at the cult-like following this series has attracted, as though this film contains amazing universal truths previously undiscovered by our benighted species.  People rave about these movies as though Neo &amp; the gang have ushered them into the intellectual-spiritual light of day.<br />What a load of hooey.  Not only has the artificial reality concept been done before (and done to death, mind you) in the science fiction genre, but the concept that life is only a dream has been explored by philosophers, to a depth much more thorough than this film could ever hope to go.<br />In and of itself, being imitative &amp; derivative is hardly a offense unique to &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  However, this movie compounds its crime by exuding a self-importance that is truly nauseating at times.  If the Wachowski brothers truly believe that they are imparting some great existential revelations through this movie, it is only because they have spent too much time reading comic books and not enough time reading the numerous philosophers who have covered this ground many times before.  The same can be said, incidentally, for the numerous movie viewers who found themselves blown away by this film's content.<br />The self-importance of this movie reminds me of the comic-book geek subculture that insists that comic books be called &quot;graphic novels.&quot;  Given the Wachowski brothers' background in the comic book industry, this should hardly be surprising.  Sorry folks, but a graphic novel is still just a goddamned comic book with some fancy packaging, and &quot;The Matrix&quot; is just a goddamned kung-fu shoot-em-up movie with a lot of special effects thrown in to distract you from that.<br />And my goodness, does this movie ever revel in its special effects, to the point of almost drowning the audience in them.  One has to suspect a movie that resorts to special effects to such an excessive degree is perhaps trying to obscure a storyline that is a bit too weak &amp; derivative.<br />Once you take away all the bells &amp; whistles, what you are left with is a not particularly original or thought-provoking movie that would like you to believe that it is much more deep &amp; important than it truly is.  Talk about an artificially-induced reality!  This movie self-fulfills its own prophecies more than the Wachowskis ever could have realized.ree is perhaps trying to obscure a storyline that is a bit too weak &amp; derivative.<br />Once you take away all the bells &amp; whistles, what you are left with is a not particularly original or thought-provoking movie that would like you to believe that it is much more deep &amp; important than it truly is.

038533348X|4.0|I remember reading this book 20 years ago and it sorta stuck in the back of my mind.  Then about 3 months ago I was reading about the prion theory of the transmission of mad cow disease in a popular science magazine, and it struck me as sounding very familiar....then I remembered Vonnegut's Ice9.<br />The prion theory goes like this.  There is a protein in your brain which normally folds itself into a particular shape in order to perform it's function.  Along comes a prion, which is the same protein, except that it has folded itself into a new shape.  This single mishapen protein molecule teaches the normal protein molecules in your brain how to fold into this dangerous, new, non-functional form.  Soon afterwards, your brain begins to crystallize into something resembling swiss cheese.<br />Twenty years ago, it bothered me that the central scientific premise of an otherwise fine novel was so implausible....obviously, I no longer feel that way.
B000002UAC|5.0|While this LP contains quite a few covers, the energy with which the fab four attacks all these tunes is positively addictive. &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; is George Harrison's early lament of immense fame and it's lack of privacy, while the classy, elegant &quot;Not A Second Time&quot; is my very favorite early Beatles tune with a flawless lead vocal from John Lennon. The chugging &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; and Ringo's explosive &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; are terrific fast tracks that showcase the group at it's poppiest and most upbeat. They would only get better from here. A Classic.
0385504209|2.0|Brown's conspiracy has been cribbed from the Illuminati Trilogy and Umberto Eco's masterpiece Foucault's Pendulum. If you're under 25, read the Illuminati -- it's not nobel material, but it will blow your mind.  Eco on the otherhand needs no introduction -- he is one of the foremost writers of our generation, and Foucault's Pendulum is at once gripping, astoundingly well written and steeped in every historical conspiracy.  By contrast, Brown is but a dilettante.
0375703764|5.0|I agree with many of the comments below, though I would add a couple things.<br />The first and immediate problem is cramming this book into a genre. It is not simply \\"genre-bending\\"--it questions the very idea of \\"genre\\" as such. In this light, as others have said, it cannot be approached as a \\"novel\\" strictly speaking. There has long been hostility among academics for people who expect everything to be an \\"easy read\\". Yet this book can't be approached in the same way as the celebrated pinnacles of high modernism like Ulysses or White Noise. Neither would I imagine people like Harold Bloom or Thomas Foster (who would actually read his book \\"How to read literature like a professor\\"?) have good things to say about this work.<br />If Joyce's Ulysses was the landmark novel of high modernism in the twentieth century, Danielewski's House of Leaves is arguably the greatest novel of the twenty-first century (so far) and, I think, is possibly the watershed of high POSTmodernity. The San Diego Tribune was, I believe, perfectly justified in comparing Danielewski to Melville, Joyce, and Nabakov. Any attempt at paraphrasing the work would be sacrilegious as seem to be most interpretations of it. One exception is a review quoted on the back cover: \\"A love story by a semiotician. Danielewski has a songwriter's heart as attuned to heartache as he is to Derrida's theory on the sign\\". More accurately, this work is the penultimate manifestation of Derrida's deconstruction of philosophy and literature (although it is arguably still \\"(phallo)logocentric\\"). Danielewski's erudition is astonishing, though not for its own sake: rather, for what he does with it. He is not a scholar; he is, indubitably, an artist and his excursus on Heidegger, Freud and the uncanny (unheimlich), Derridan deconstruction, as well as his appropriation of the horror genre makes the book unsettling in a way only a novel can. Danielewski is keenly aware of the power of images to unsettle us (e.g., the Matrix or, alternatively, any number of horror films, particularly the older variety as opposed to the rivers-of-blood slashers today) and he shows us how text (viz. words) can unsettle us even more profoundly. Since the use of words (language) is the way by which we structure the world, Danielewski uses this fact to use his text (the text itself in some places) to disturb the very thing by which we make sense of the world--he disturbs our security at our conceptual roots. The \\"monster-in-the-dark\\"--the unknown--is unsettling per se; Danielewski unROOTS us until we are left hanging but by a thread to the habits and nomological security of language with which we operate on a day-to-day basis. It is not what might be in the dark or what the dark conceals that leaves us frightened--it is the dark itself. He has, further, in a single swoop, preempted (or at least undermined) the very possibility of an exegesis of his work and the hermenutic discipline in toto (I suppose I could also have said \\"he has undermined hermenutics as a discipline\\"). (Whether or not he intended to do so is, of course, patently irrelevant.) Danielewski has provided, too, a commentary on the metanarrative involved in the consideration of the book as a physical object and, as such, an object of representation and aesthetic judgment (inverting the dialectic of form and content, showing how the book itself (the form) can be evaluated aesthetically).<br />There are those who like to call themselves \\"bibliophiles\\" or, to adapt another term, \\"petit-intellectuals\\" who make claims about what \\"good\\" literature is (e.g., it has to have a coherent plot, substantial character development). While, of course, everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, obviously this book will not draw favorable readings from those tied inexorably to the sacred literary canon. These are the same ones who hold \\"the new left\\" or \\"cultural studies\\" to be convenient labels for everything bad that has happened to \\"literature\\" over the last halfcentury; these are also the same individuals to whom the word \\"postmodern\\" elides all the vulgarity of contemporary culture. These are, finally, the same ones who do not care to make analytical distinctions between postmodernism and, say, kitsch, and who seem to believe postmodernism simply means \\"anything goes\\". To this all I can say is that this understanding of \\"postmodernism\\" is, to say the least, incomplete and consequent judgments irresponsible. It is easy to lambast things one does not like; it is another thing entirely to critique a thing while at the same time doing it justice.<BR> <BR>One doesn't have to be an academic or a literary critic to read this work, but at the same time one cannot expect it simply \\"to tell a story\\". Respectfully I must disagree entirely with the reviewer from Phoenix who said this work was neither art, postmodern, controversial, nor good. Granted \\"postmodern\\" is a fairly ambiguous term, this reviewer apparently doesn't understand, first, what \\"postmodernism\\" means and, second, that a postmodern work would be suspicious of anyone calling it \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" and taking that judgment on good faith. Neither does this reviewer seem to understand the history of literary criticism that is invoked in his/her critique of the book's narrative structure (\\"confusing\\" seems to be a common word). Sure the narrative is borrowed from Nabakov, but the narrative structure of House of Leaves is meant to be self-reflexively critical--it is meant to challenge and question the notion of \\"narrative structure\\" AS SUCH. This reviewer said, too, that \\"it pains me to think this book was published\\". I agree: it pains me to think this book was published, for Danielewski has opened himself up for the barbs and stings of Nietzsche's plundering soldiers who trample through a book \\"take a few things they can use, dirty and confound the remainder, and revile the whole\\".
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, I'm nothing more than a casual fan of Coldplay. But I am in the process of building a collection of Concert DVD's, so when this came out I figured, &quot;Why Not ?&quot;<br />Let me tell you, this package ROCKS ! From the first track of the DVD I was hooked. Chris Martin's presence onstage is impressive to behold, and the passion with which he &amp; his bandmates rip thru their material is stunning. The crowd is amazing as well, and the feeling of excitement is heightened by the quick cuts between cameras. As I said, this is my first exposure to Coldplay outside of what's on the Radio, so the only material I really knew was &quot;Politik&quot;,&quot;The Scientist&quot;, and &quot;Clocks.&quot; All were represented well, especially the latter. <br />Add to this the fact that you get nearly the entire concert on a companion Audio CD, all for around $15 and you have a set that you cannot beat for the price. I'm thoroughly impressed &amp; look forward to Coldplay's future releases. So if you're even the slightest bit curious about this band, pick up this DVD ASAP.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|While Mer De Noms used Billy Howerdel's music untouched, this album had the music modified by Maynard -- in part to match his vocalizations and in part because he wanted the album softer.  Also some of the songs were written by Maynard Keenan while on the Tool tour which he admitted limited his artistic imagination.  Where Mer De Mons left me entranced and I could not get enough of the music in a days time, this album left me quite disenchanted.<br />The music also seemed to lack -- something -- and I think it is the loss of Paz Lenchantin with no replacement of the female harmonics and violin she provided. While Weak and Powerless, for example, is a very good piece it could have been much stronger with Paz harmonizing throughout the piece.<br />I also found that many pieces just lacked the APC sound that was so consistant throught the previous album.  I also found a few of the pieces to almost be amateurish in presentation....noted as 'filler pieces' by a previous reviewer...such as Crimes...which in itself is a crime.<br />While the album is more enjoyable the more you listen to it, this album just does not grab you by the shoulders and WOW you like Mer De Noms did.  Personally I think it has to do with the changing of the music that Billy had originally written combined with the loss of Paz.  I even thought one track (The Outsider) was more like a song you would expect on a Tool CD instead of a Perfect Circle track.  All in all, an okay piece for Maynard/Perfect Circle fans but I'd recommend Mer De Noms over this CD to newcomers.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have been a devoted fan of hers ever since I heard Solace back in 1993. I have waited with bated breath for every new release since and I haven't been disappointed, and am happy to say especially now. Afterglow is nothing but beautiful! Since the release of her last album she's gotten married, lost her mother and given birth. It seems as if these events have only made her lyrics more meaningful than ever before, and her melodies even more pure. I found myself being quite emotional upon listening to this CD, identifying with many issues pertaining to loss, the love of a child, and feeling at peace with things that I can not change. I love every song, and can not point out any particular song that I loved more than another. I just highly recommend it as a beautiful piece of music as a whole.
B00005QZWI|5.0|There are some movies one will view and appreciate only the special effects, the actors' abilities, the costumes, etc. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, however, leaves the musically educated and appreciative viewer in a near trance. The original score for the motion picture possesses not only wonderful themes, but also the sheer evidence of Howard Shore's talent. Ranging from the upbeat, adventurous fellowship theme, to the ghostly presence of Enya's voice in &quot;Aniron,&quot; the CD commands respect and awe. The numerous tracks tell the story of the Ring even better than the movie itself. As an avid reader, I have always said that the book is better than the movie; the soundtrack for FELLOWSHIP reaches an equilibrium with Tolkien's epic work. Bravo to Howard Shore on a wonderfully composed score, and also to the London Philharmonic Orchestra, The Voices of London, and the Oratory School Schola Boys' Choir for demonstrating that beauty, talent, and the quality of performance compose the very soul of music.

I'm loving this CD, it took me a min. to pick it up only because of some of the comments I've heard, trust me, you got to listen to self, cause from trax first to last, this CD has your head bobbing,fingers snaping, [back] moving and  I know all the words. I've had this CD for only two wks.<br />I really love hearing my boys DP and their new joint.<br />Yo, DP and Erika, yo that's a rap.<br />I'm telling you, you have got to follow your on vibes about Ms. Badu's disc.
B00005JMNY|3.0|I liked this movie to the point where I couldnt stand it anymore but all in all it was a good view. Culkin is ok but he is overpowered by the performance of Seth Green who shines in this flick. not for everyones taste. MArilyn Manson, Chloe Sevingy and Wilmer Valderama also star. highlight is when Seth Green and Culkin are on that talk show and Green is a troll
B00005NGAL|5.0|This is the production of CATS to see.  All of the members of this cast were hand picked throughout the world as the best performers for the roles and it shows.  Even though many of the cast had not worked together before, when they came together for this performance they clicked.<BR>  This special DVD is simply amazing: the colors, the performance, the music-everything is spectaculure.  Each performance is done so well that it's hard to choose any one as a standout...having Elaine Paige as Grizabella, the role she orginated, was cool;  Ken Page is a wonderful Old Dueteronomy, and Michael Gruber as Munkustrap shines...I could go on and on.<BR>  Everyone should own or see this DVD, even if they don't know CATS.  The bonus material is a plus, it's great to see the cast out of make-up and get their thoughts on the musical; simply put-there's nothing I don't like about this DVD.  The beauty of the instrumental parts, as well as the vocals, makes me wonder why this wonderful edition was released on CD...Regardless, this is a must have.
0790729709|5.0|Wow...This movie is the best I've ever seen. It was supposed to go to Diana Ross and some other guy. I'm glad the roll went to Whitney. Diana would not fit this roll. Wow, three lines into the review and I'm already off task. Okay. Why should you give this movie a chance? Because it's amazing. Whitney proves she is a great actress and singer. Her voice makes this movie even better. The songs fit perfectly. And Kevin Costner, this movie alone makes me a fan, and I haven't seen his other work. It leaves you in suspense, as a mysterious stalker is following Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) step by step, waiting for the time to attempt in killing her. This movie has a dark atmosphere, which is something I love about it. It's not like most love stories. I was very unsure about trying this movie, because I get bored easily, and I'm not a big romance movie fan, but this movie is so different from a typical romance film. It doesn't just focus on the romance, it focuses on Rachel's career, the stalker, Frank's resistance to grow close to his client. That's what makes this movie so special. I'm thrilled Kevin talked Whitney into this film, although it took her over a year to decide, it was worth it. No one could have done the roles better than Kevin and Whitney.
0385504209|2.0|There's no arguing that books on and about Da Vinci's hidden  clues and Knights Templer are not only very pertinent but very compelling as well. Dan Brown's approach to the subject is via a story line which is stilted and awkward. Sadly, The Da Vinci Code's disjointed narrative detracts from Brown's great personal wealth of knowledge on the subjects.  Author Brown would have been far better served to have written a direct treatise on the facts as they exist rather than try to string them all together via a plot line which, for the most part, was trite and forced.  But hey, he's a published author and I'm not.
0804102988|5.0|This was a truly wonderful read.  Other reviews have pointed out certain facts though.  If you want a straight read of one time period or one family, then this is not for you.  However, if you want a sampling of history covering about 10,000 years and want a wide range of stories, then this book is perfect.<BR>You really need to pay attention and then you can see how different lineages keep cropping up throughout history.  Sarum also has the little people of Salisbury bumping into great figures of history.<BR>One thing I loved about this book, was it was honest.  Most novels, you have the good guys win and everyone lives happily ever after in the end.  If a bad guy wins, don't worry, justice will soon prevail.  That's not real life.  I like those books, but Sarum was wonderfully true for a change.  Here, the badguys were defeated for a while, but sometimes they one.  Then sometimes they became more powerful than the good guys.  Some good guys were ruined and never recovered.  Some did recover.  there were also characters that Rutherfurd would develop, then let them die unfairly.  But guess what.  That's what happens in real life.<BR>The only negatives were mentioned by others.  The little stone figure's story did end too soon.  We know about this figure now and it would have been nice to read how it was finally found again.  Also, the ending was a little choppy.  I was surprised Rutherfurd left out WWI entirely.  That was a big time and should have been included.  Also, the names were confusing in 1985.  I knew who most of the characters were, but who they had married didn't make sense and the family names were messed up in the end.  That was too confusing.  Even still, he did end the book nicely as a whole, bringing Sarum into the present day.  Definitely an excellent read and I'm off to get his other books now.

B00004XOWM|2.0|When I first bought this album, I thought it would be a new type of food product. I thought it was going to be a pack of chocolatate starfish with some hot dog flavored water to wash it down. Well, I was slightly dissapointed because I didn't get what I wanted. I mean, Limp Bizkits '3 Doller Bill Y'all and Significant Other' were better than this! For some reason though, I didn't confuse those albums with food products. Maybe it was because they had way better name for the titles of their albums. I mean, why kinda name is Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water?! Limp Bizkit shouldent confuse us like that! This album is kind of boring too. Theres not many good songs here. Even some songs that are supposed to be serious (like &quot;Boiler&quot;) have some silly lyrics like &quot;No eating no sleeping just giving into you and i'm dumb&quot;. Why are you gonna starve yourself out, Fred, when you can eat chocolate starfish and drink hotdog flavored water? I just don't undertstand. My favorite song on this album is 'Hold On'. This was very dissapointing. Buyers beware: this product might not be what your looking for. Get it expecting a not so great Limp Bizkit album. Don't get it looking for chocolate starfish and hot dog flavored water. Hey, at least I know why they don't sell it in super markets...

B00003CXCS|5.0|I am 33 years old and am African-American.  As a child, my three siblings and I watched the Sound of Music year after year after year.  We learned and sang along to ALL of the songs, knew the children's names, demeanors, as well as anticipated the entire plot unfolding each time it aired on TV.  My mother loved music, movies, comedy and fun.  If the Sound of Music was considered a \\"baby-sitter\\" back then to her, then she hired the right lady in Julie Andrews and the cast.  We would sit quietly and intently watching the movie only to make noise when called for (singing, laughing, and crying).<br />As an adult, the love for this movie has never changed.  Julie Andrews' role as Maria led us to embrace life through sharing in her joys, fears, hopes, innocense, sorrows, and her journey to find out what really mattered in life in this movie.<br />It is truly a classic that ALL people should watch, share with family, friends and of course their children.  When I have kids of my own, the classic edition will be one of their \\"baby sitters\\", and hopefully it will bridge a gap in communicating how life can show you many things about yourself and others.<br />My sister and I introduced the soundtrack to our nephew at the age of 6.  He's 13 years old and was watching the movie on TV when it last aired a few months ago.  He loves the songs and I am sure, as it \\"stuck\\" to us, it has taken the same meaning to him.  I would encourage you to buy the video, DVD and soundtrack.  They are truly collectors items.  You will not be disappointed.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Best Comedy of the Year?  No, it's not the movie.  It's this forum.<br />Tolkien purists and closet critics please put it to rest.  Yes, no film budget in the world can truly bring a good work of text to the screen.  Yes, essential Tolkien themes and characters never made it to the theatre.  Yes, your mind's eye was raped with someone else's perceived narrow view.  --  Get over it.  The `feeble' attempt, as some are inclined to avow, that Peter Jackson and company performed in bringing LOTR to the screen resulted in some of the most memorable film making ever created.<br />Yes, I've read Tokien's works many times over and was also disappointed in some of the edits, modifications and fabrications in the screenplay.  I would consider that disappointment the driving factor for buying or renting the extended editions.  Jackson and Co., go to great lengths describing their methodology and process during the book to screen process.  Their attention to detail and each individual contributor's motivation are well documented in the extended editions.<br />Those who dislike the trilogy simply upon the basis that it doesn't meet their expectations after reading the works in print are truly missing out.<br />Cheers,<br />D
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums to come out this year, there have been a few band member changes since Mer de Noms, and it certainly shows.<br />In contrast to their previous album, (which was good too, don't get me wrong), A Perfect Circle have become a lot more alterative and experimental, but still maintaining strong riffs and killer beats throughout. The album flows more as a cohesive whole that MdN and by the end you'll have a huge grin on your face.<br />Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howerdel have obviously really put their heads together for this album and it is now very obvious that this is certainly not just a &quot;Side Project&quot;.<br />Track List:<BR>1) The Package - What a great way to start, Maynard shows that he's still got it, able to soothe you with whispered melodies at one point, then rip you to shreds the next. The way this track explodes half-way through was very nice and you just felt the power rise through your whole body at that moment.<br />2) Weak and Powerless - This was their single, and for a good reason, it's probably the most consistent track and maintains a great strength throughout it.<br />3) The Noose - one of their most gentle songs. There are no real explosions of power in this one, but the beauty and heartfelt manner with which Maynard sings really makes this a strong track. Cool layering effect too.<br />4) Blue - Another consistent track, with a bit of a weak beginning, but once you get into it you'll love it.<br />5) Vanished - Probably the weakest track on the album as it doesn't really go anywhere or do anything, nice intro but decidedly weak when compared with the rest of the album.<br />6) A Stranger - This is one of my absolute favourites, gentle, soothing and absolutely beautiful, Maynard goes all-out with heart-wrenching lyrics and intonation, fading to the softest of whispers at some points. The two deep chords struck half-way through this track will make you pee your pants.<br />7) The Outsider - I really like thistrack because it picks off from the gentle attitiude and creates an aggressive and angry piece where the rage and disgust seem to come alive. The way that the line &quot;Medicated drama queen, picture perfect numb beligerence&quot; is said will send shivers down your spine.<br />8) Crimes - This is really just a filler so it ain't worth reviewing.<br />9) The Nurse Who Loved Me - It is at this point that you realise that Maynard is one screwed up dude. Totally shifting from anything he has ever done, this song has been adapted from another band and is funny, yet disturbing at the same time.<br />10) Pet - Probably my favourite track on the whole cd and one of the only &quot;current issues&quot; songs that I have ever heard Maynard do. The power in this track is juxtaposed with moments of soft menace, then ripping out agian with awesome riffs.<br />11) Lullaby - A continuation of Pet, but acting as a softer version, with memories of Parabol/Parabola from Tool coming in. It really acts as a filler more than anything else.<br />12) Gravity - A beautiful track that closes off the whole album very nicely. <br />Whew, so that's all of them. I would highly recommend this album, hopefully it will kepp me satisfied until the new Tool album comes out.
0792846303|4.0|After the smash success of his 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN, director John Carpenter, along with his producer Debra Hill, instead of exploiting that film's success with a sequel (for the time being, anyway), decided to make a ghost story.  The result, the 1980 thriller THE FOG, was almost certainly the first really good horror film of the Eighties, one that for the most part was otherwise dominated by HALLOWEEN-inspired slasher movies.<br />Like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS and Spielberg's JAWS, THE FOG is set in a seaside community.  This time, it's Antonio Bay, on the coast of Northern California, near Point Reyes.  The community is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary of existence, and a lot of people are in attendance.  But, in the film's prologue, as an old man of the sea (John Houseman) relates it to some kids, we learn that a crew of leper pirates had been led to a watery grave while being guided by a lighthouse beacon onshore shining through a very thick fog bank.  Now, these same pirates are about to take their revenge on the people and visitors of Antonio Bay, shrouded by that very same thick blanket of fog that sent them to their doom a century before.<br />As with HALLOWEEN, Carpenter has sought to limit the violence and gore that was starting to become part-and-parcel of most commercial horror films of the time.  Instead, he opts for a combination of supernatural horror, mystery, and suspense, as Antonio Bay's townsfolk find themselves at the mercy of a past they thought they had put behind them.  And for this, Carpenter has assembled a tresure trove of actors--Jamie Lee Curtis (HALLOWEEN); her real-life mother Janet Leigh (PSYCHO); Hal Holbrook (ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN); Charles Cyphers; and Nancy Loomis, to name just a few.  Although some plot holes do lessen the experience somewhat, THE FOG still succeeds as an atmospheric thriller, largely thanks to Carpenter's own piano-dominated music score, the eerie fog effects, and Dean Cundey's superb cinematography.<br />Only a handful of horror movies from this point on would ever really be considered classic material.  THE FOG is admittedly slightly imperfect, but in comparison to much of the dreck that followed in the 1980s, it is very much a classic nevertheless.
B0000025P9|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums.  The songs are all so different, yet each is musically intricate and complex.  The lyrics are great, the music is great. But what really made me respect this album is something I caught after many, many run-throughs.  Intended or otherwise, it's a concept album.  Think about it. The songs trace a man from love, to breakup, to strife, to hope, to new love and hope for the future. Let me demonstrate. Here are key lyrics from each track, and my impression:<br />1: All I wanna do when I wake up in the morning is see you rise.<BR>(Madly in love)<br />2: Why don't we make believe we're in love again<BR>(Love ends, as it sometimes does through no-one's fault. He foolishly thinks things can be rebuilt once they've been torn down, which almost never happens.)<br />3: I won't hold you back.<BR>(Letting her go to find happiness because he loves her and wants this for her.)<br />4: I could be good for you! You could be good for me too!<BR>(One more try to woo her back?  Or wooing a new girl too soon, trying only to fill the void?)<br />5: It's a feeling, you never belonged to me. You're fighting me.<BR>(Contemplating what went wrong. Realizes it wasn't so perfect, now that the rose-colored glasses of love are gone.)<br />6: I like the way you move and just the way you are. I can't take anymore, 'cause girl, you're pushing too hard. 'Cause I've never been afraid of love 'till I met you.<BR>(Being over-cautious after heartbreak leaves one to turn down or otherwise not earnestly pursue relationships, relationships they will regret not pursuing later on.)<br />7: You know she's gonna make you cry, you know she's gonna make you cry. She'll have you walk beneath the ladder you were meant to climb.<BR>(Callous to love. Anger/resentment stage of grief. The main cause of men who say &quot;Women are b****. No more for me!&quot; They're hurt and disempowered.)<br />8: We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again.<BR>(This boy is having trouble moving on.)<br />9: I've been waitin' for your love, And it's been here all the time right in front of me. I've been sitting, waiting for your love, And all the time it's been here right in front of me<BR>(Eventually finds new love, and the cycle starts again, hopefully to have a happier ending this time)<br />10: It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you. There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do. Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.<BR>(A song to one's love, wherever she may be, even if one hasn't met her yet; We'll meet, we'll fall in love. We'll take time to do things right.)<br />Having been one if the infinite number of men, and women, who has been in these places and can relate with this perception of this album, I just find it almost chillingly accurate.  Sometimes we feel as though we're the only ones who have felt this way.  <br />From this album I came away with the following: You're not the only one.  There's always tomorrow; always hope.<br />While brief in minutes, this album is an epic of emotions.  Try it. I think you'll relate.
0385720920|4.0|Killer story, the typical Chuck characters and imagery, but I felt a little empty with the lack of climax, but then it all makes sense afterwards...That's the whole point. We're all just striving for one climax after another, when life is really just meant to be lived. Easily a necessity for any Palahniuk or postmodern literature fan.
B00005NTJM|4.0|Standing apart from most of their later work in many respects, Jethro Tull's first album is an impressive debut, notable mostly for the excellence of instrumental performance and the eclectic nature of the material. Mischaracterized as a Cream-like blues outfit, Tull at the outset already exhibited a variety of musical styles and downright quirkiness that smacks of the wholly original. While pieces like &quot;It's Breaking Me Up,&quot; &quot;Someday the Sun Won't Shine For You,&quot; and &quot;Cat's Squirrel&quot; (a version that outdoes even Clapton) clearly grew out of the late 60s English blues-hard rock modality that also gave birth to bands like Zeppelin, Sabbath, and Purple, other tracks already demonstrate an idiosyncratic versatility beyond the reach of those immediate contemporaries, prime examples of which are &quot;Serenade to a Cuckoo,&quot; &quot;Move On Alone,&quot; and &quot;Dharma For One.&quot; The album's central highlight is the obvious white hot chemistry between Mick Abrahams (guitar), Glenn Cornick (bass) and Clive Bunker (percussion). In some ways, THIS WAS is more their album than Ian Anderson's in as much as he had not yet reached either his songwriting, lyrical or vocalizing maturity. Mick Abraham's influence is especially pronounced and he stands as the only other member of Tull for a decade to earn a credit for musical composition. Nevertheless, even at this early (even primitive) stage, Ian Anderson is the clear focal point on the album's central tracks, &quot;My Sunday Feeling,&quot; &quot;Beggar's Farm,&quot; and &quot;Song For Jeffrey.&quot; In general, THIS WAS is a very good album on its own merits, thoroughly recommendable as perhaps the first legitimately great blues-jazz fusion in the hard rock genre; yet it gives but a taste of the masterpieces to come.

B000002IWQ|4.0|Counterparts(1993). Rush's fifteenth studio album.<br />By now, Rush has gone through no less than 4 phases in their entire 30 year career span. First they started out playing classic hard rock (debut-Caress Of Steel), their wildly progressive sci-fi period (2112-Hemispheres), their condensed yet introspective pop/rock period (Permanent Waves-Hold Your Fire), and the brief adult contemporary pop/rock period (Presto & Roll The Bones). Counterparts is the beginning of the modern hardrock era for Rush, as they decided to push the keyboards aside in favor of the crunchy guitar oriented rock they were known for in the beginning. After the low-key Rupert Hines production of the previous two albums, Rush brought back producer Peter Collins, who collaborated with them on the albums Power Windows(1985) and Hold Your Fire(1987). As the editorial review indicates, Windows and Fire bashers should take note that this is THE most polished, overproduced, and clean sounding Rush album ever made (the three albums were all produced by Peter Collins, who is known to push production values to the maximum). The drums, bass, and keyboards (yes there are still keyboards people, just used more subtly) are all clearly heard, while you get the impression that this album was designed to center in on the grunge-like guitars.<br />I'm sort of divided when it comes to this particular album. Rush does sound much heavier than they've ever been in the 80s and the trio still has what it takes to play great music. However, while half the songs are outstanding, the other half or so come off as uninspired and contrived. Others have noted that Rush takes a backseat on Counterparts and becomes influenced by the then-current Seatle Grunge scene (who in turn were originally influenced by Rush). Even though this is probably one of my least favorite Rush albums, oddly enough Counterparts does contain my two favorite modern era Rush songs, Cut To The Chase and Coldfire, which both display Rush at their all-time melodic best. Basically, when the songs work here they work very well, though there are also many instances of when some of them just fall flat. It's a hit or miss album, so to speak.<br />The main theme of Counterparts lies clearly in the self-spoken title. It covers a topic that most every band beats to death: love. Thankfully, Rush knows how to delve into love without risking at sounding cliche. The mood on this album is also dark and melodic, similar to how Moving Pictures(1981) was. At this point, Neil's lyrical talent starts to wane a bit (a problem that was solved by the new Vapor Trails(2002) album). I know that many people can interpret what each song means far better than I can, but I will provide a brief explanation of the tracks, so please bear with me. Here's the breakdown track-by-track:<br />1) Animate- A decent, yet predictable song about love. Nice backing of organs to compliment the song, though it doesn't retain very many qualities about what makes Rush sound like Rush. Still, it has a nice build up towards the end and it makes for a great opener. 9/10<br />2) Stick It Out- This track is about surviving no matter what. A hard rocker with plenty of punch, but something missing also. Probably the heaviest track on the album. Not bad, but not great. 8/10<br />3) Cut To The Chase- EXCELLENT TRACK. Very moody and engaging. Lyrically, its a throwback to the previous album's main theme of chance. The guitar solo here is one of the best that Alex has ever done. Clearly a standout track. 10/10<br />4) Nobody's Hero- A song that deals with the topic of homosexuality. This is one of those tracks which excells musically, but fails on the lyrical front. Michael Kamen's orchestrations fit well during the chorus. 9/10<br />5) Between Sun & Moon- As another reviewer put, it's a fantasy themed song with a compimenting rocker structure. Not bad, but definitely not a standout either. 8/10<br />6) Alien Shore- This track is about understanding the opposite sex. Itworks the opposite way of track #4: Lyrically it shines, but musically it falls flat. 7/10<br />7) Speed Of Love- I'm surprised that nobody seems to like this song. It's not as hard rocking as the rest of the album, but it captures Rush in one of their more melodic overtones. I agree that it's not very progressive, but it serves as a good break from the rest of the album. 9/10<br />8) Double Agent- OUTSTANDING. At first I didn't like this track, but it quickly grew on me and now I consider it one of the album's best songs. It's about the struggle between good and evil through dreams and everyday life. Very progressive in its structure, this track has one thing that Geddy Lee does with his voice which you'd never expect: sound menacing. His \\"spoken word\\" verses are something that has to be heard to be believed. 10/10<br />9) Leave That Thing Alone- A perfectly crafted instrumental which sounds like a minor take on the previous album's instrumental. At parts it sounds like 'Red Sector A', 'Animate', 'Territories', and 'YYZ'. A varied and clever jam session. 10/10<br />10) Coldfire- THE OTHER STANDOUT TRACK. Coldfire is a song that has a very melodic 80s commercial vibe to it, but at the same time, it sounds like nothing Rush ever did in the 80s. It contains a very infectious chorus and rocks hard and light during different parts of hte song. It's another track about love. 10/10<br />11) Everyday Glory- This closer track fails to really make a lasting impression, and it's a slight letdown from the previous 3 fantastic tracks. It's about the ordinary way of life that people get caught up in. 8/10<br />Counterparts is not a bad album at all, but at the same time it's not an essential addition to the Rush catalogue either. Here's my reason for this review's title: Counterparts is underrated because it came out well after Rush's peak years, so people will tend to ignore this release. However, Counterparts is also a bit overrated too because those that do praise this albumtend to bash anything that came out after Moving Pictures and before this one. True, Rush is and always has been a band about guitar technique, but every period of the band's history deserves some credit. BUY THIS ALBUM ONLY IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD RUSH FAN.

B00004YRQA|5.0|All the previous owners of PS ONE remembers how was the performance of the past generation of Memory Cards ,they were very unreliable with limited storage space which weren't enough if you had a large games collection ,I had a problem my self with one of the official memory cards when all the saved data on it simply vanished ,not only that but it started making conflictions with the PS unit ,and after the arrival of PS2 with the new 8 MB memory cards ,your troubles seems now a very faded memory .<br />The PS2 Memory Card are sleek and elegant one ,with the black color to give a better look with your console ,now you can browse the saved data in interactive mode ,after you open the Memory Card's browser you will find that some saved games will have moving 3D Icons which gives more enjoyable meaning for dealing with your saved data ,the loading times are faster and beside all now you can rest assured that your data will not get removed by accident ,and you can see if any file has any kind of protection or not ,only one small drawback is that with the DVD format of PS2 games you will have to have more than one Memory Card if you have a large collection of games or if you are saving multiple files for each game ,but the overall feeling is excellent anyway .
B000002KB8|4.0|Wonder what it takes to achieve top-100 reviewer status? Probably at least to review all albums by this or that artist. Well, not me ... wanna know about Sabbath in my thinking ... read this, cause I am not going to repeat myself on some 25 original releases let alone hundred &quot;best of's&quot; or more.<BR>And what more proper place to go than the very first release. Not the best ... not by far. Probably not much more than 3+ but then again .. as a whole you would need to give the band at least 4+ and for some releases flatout 5 (more actually).<BR>Sabbath was and is the godmothers of Heavy Metal and certainly one of very few bands who influenced rock for more than 30 years and will continue to do so for 30 more. Why? Because the strength of their art is creation, not particularily strong musicianship. Most of their competitors severely lacked the first dimension althougt they may well have been superior concerning the second one. This goes for Deep Purple to mention the most prominent. Noone in their right mind would invest in modern bands playing Purple-songs today - they lack the basic quality of timelessnes so to speak. Sabbath on the other hand are constantly covered, copyed and built on. And this goes to prove to anyone who might have said or thought otherwise a quarter of a century ago that they were wrong, wrong, wrong. With the possible exeption of Led Zep, nothing remotely as important as Sabbath ever happened to rock. We had prog, we had punk cleaning out the closet, we had superior technical bands of the eighties, we had grungebands many of which owe there sound to Sabbath and so on .... but no wave or individual artist ever induced such violent influence to the rock-scene ... <BR>So Sabbath is music and religion in one. Having said that their trackrecord is fairly bumpy. Masterpieces such as Maters of Reality and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and yeah I suppose that goes for Paranoid too ... count on one side but slightly less inspired albums (few in the ozzy-era but a slight decline in quality after Sabbath Bloody Sabbath has to be admitted), count on the other.<BR>This album is at the other end of the food-chain beeing Sabbaths very first release. It was recorded in only two days or so the story goes. It was produced on a more than limited budget and the sound of rain at the beginning is actually a slightly distorted fryingpan with a couple of eggs, sunny side up (give it a spin and asses for yourself :o)<BR>Anyway - it is a more than decent album with at couple of classics on it aswell: Black Sabbath and NIB. The Wizzard is also strong although not very Sabbath-like. The rest of the album is more average but fairly strong at that and clearly strongest when the newfound sound of doom and sorrow is reflected (Sleeping Village f.i.). Not so relevant to my mind is tracks like Warning and Wicked World, neither is Evil Woman that replaces the latter on some versions of the album.<BR>What remains is the fact that this album sparked a rocklegend and in its own respect it contains a couple of vintage-tracks plus the innovative somber sound that was to be Black Sabbaths ultimate trademark. You need to buy this album. You really do. On the other hand ... if you only want one Sabbath album at this point start out with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or one of the other &quot;majors&quot;.
079073804X|4.0|i saw both versions of this movie as well as the sequels, the first one is the best of course, the movie certainly wasn't scary as people said it was(well it wasn't at all), personally think movies like &quot;the thing&quot; are scarier, the only disturbing part of the movie was the girl's demented face, other than that the movie failed to create an eeerie mood.<br />if you want to see something that is ACTUALLY SCARY then go buy the &quot;aphex twin - come to viddy&quot; video.
B000002HPV|5.0|The Mission: To create a perfectly flawless beautiful masterpiece of musical and lyrical genius.  The Result:  Homogenic by Bjork.  This album will floor you.  It is comprised of 11 songs that are so good that it doesn't seem possible that they were created on earth.  Bjork's voice is amazing all the way through and her vocal soundscapes allow you to peer directly into her soul.  Homogenic = Perfection in the form of an album.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's gorgeous, luscious voice is once again the centrepiece in her work.  Despite most of the material being written well before life-changing events such as her mother's death and the birth of her daughter, the songs on this album are just about that -- life, death, and all the messy things in-between.  Sarah's pacing and style, as always, are acquired tastes... she wraps her voice around you like a warm blanket in &quot;Answer&quot;; at other times, she glides coolly and effortlessly, as a glacier would over tundra, setting up an introspective mood.  <br />Overall, the sound record to me seems to be a combination of her last three albums proper;  there are the requisite Surfacing era piano-based ballads in &quot;Answer,&quot; and &quot;Dirty Little Secret,&quot; the Solace era melodies in &quot;Drifting,' and the verses of 'Stupid', the Fumbling Towards Ecstasy textures and lyrical depth in &quot;World on Fire,&quot; (mostly written by her producer Pierre Marchand) &quot;Stupid,&quot; and the fantastic &quot;Dirty Little Secret.&quot; <br />I like 9 out of the 10 songs, which, in my books, is no small feat for any artist to accomplish.  &quot;Drifing,&quot; is the only song that I'm indifferent about, but that might change after time.  <BR>Some highlights upon first listen:<br />&quot;Fallen,&quot; the lead single, is about the irrevocable mistakes we make in our lives that force us to wallow within, and then move on.  In terms of sound, it's reminiscent of &quot;Building A Mystery,&quot; from her last album, Surfacing.       <br />&quot;World on Fire,&quot; is a beautiful song about ugliness.  Being the only song written after her mother's passing and her daughter's birth, its subject matter is the reconciliation of innocence with chaos in our post 9/11 world.  Sarah's voice soars, and the instrumentation is lush, harkening back to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy's layered textures.<br />&quot;Stupid&quot; is as close to a driving, straight-ahead rock songon the album as Sarah gets, and it is a great payoff.  A killer chorus is bookended by Solace-style, melodic verses about being smitten by someone that you know is bad for you.  Sarah's voice is raw and close to the edge;  it would be amazing to see her just cut loose and let her powerful voice go completely, as it did in her cover of XTC's &quot;Dear God.&quot; Another thing to note is that he strings and orchestration for &quot;Stupid&quot; are a brilliant touch. <br />&quot;Train Wreck&quot; is notable because it offers, for a Sarah McLachlan song, unusual instrumentation.  There are ambient electronic sounds and beats, and hopefully this is an avenue she and her producer will further explore on her next album, when she tackles the weighty dramas that have consumed her life in the past few years. <br />&quot;Answer&quot; is, well, the Answer to &quot;Angel.&quot;  It's a low-key, very chill track that epitomizes what Sarah McLachlan's recent sound has transformed into -- an extremely soothing, maternal sound that comforts us and slows us down in our sometimes too fast-paced world.  Centred around the piano, Sarah's voice is at the forefront, taking  all troubles to &quot;wash this from my mind.&quot;   <br />&quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; is a very personal song, and could well be this album's &quot;Do What You Have To Do.'  It has the storytelling quality of her work on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.  Confessional lyrics are glazed with a decadent wine sauce; the result is nothing short of epic, as she journeys through a messy relationship from the past.  <br />It's hard to argue that Sarah is an artist that speaks to her audience, and that she is an artist who is getting more and more precise with her composing and deliberate in her writing. She conjures complex, emotional nuance in unpretentious, natural lyrics that can catch a listener offguard in a moment of vulnerability or reflection.  This is an album that will surprise you on one of those nights when you'relistening with headphones after one too many drinks.  <br />In a bleak musical landscape littered with gangster rappers one-upping each other about guns, cash, and hos, cookie-cutter hip-hop beats and hooks, and manufactured pop tarts that are known best by their first names, Sarah's voice blasts across the skyline like a radiant shaft of light.  Sarah McLachlan is so endearingly unphased by trends; instead, she tip-toes gently through the geography of the heart.
0385504209|2.0|I thought we'd all had enough of Jack Ryan (is he GOD by now?) in those paper thin cutout character clones that permeate Clancy's work.  I also thought that we'd had enough of the mega conspiracy novels starring the (only millimeters thicker) Jason Bourne who seems to have identity crises without having an identity.<br />Put this irregularly-paced (pacemaker required?) up against more thoughtful work by Le Carre or the brilliant Ian Rankin (Rebus) or even Michael Connely (Bosch) and it pales by comparison.<br />The Da Vinci Code is shallow and pretentious, replete with leaps of untenable measure.  It is uneven and unpolished as it moves from breathtaking (gasp) action through the doldrums of didactic lecturing and pseudo moral suasion.<br />As with many works in this genre, it seems prepared for the inevitable Hollywood screenplay with fast-paced exciting (yawn) car chase scenes and cartoon-like characters.<br />I'd rather spend an evening at the WWF thanks.
B00008H2LB|5.0|i must admit that this is not as good as hybrid theory but it is still very good for a second cd. they haven't run out of steam yet. this sounds more industrial and it is much softer than hybrid theory but it is still an excellent choice for listening. it's kinda short so it was really disappointing for driving on long trips. the lyrics are much more standard here, they are all about the same. same theme as hybrid theory just with a new twist. i still really enjoyed it and must give it 5 stars just because i love to hear chester when he does let loose and scream....

B000089RVR|4.0|This album is great, but there's just something missing as compared to the previous album (No Angel).  I can listen to No Angel for hours on end... and I admit, Life for Rent is the only album I've listened to for weeks.  But I think the newness will soon wear off and I'll go back to No Angel to consistently sooth my spirits and give me rest.  My suggestion, buy No Angel and then buy this album afterwards... you'll sense the evolution and have an appreciation for both albums...  I enjoy everything from Slipknot to Garth Brooks, but Dido takes the cake for long-term listenability.  You'll get your money's worth and you'll have to buy the CDs again after you wear 'em out...
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I am so bummed I did not get to see this movie while it was in the theater.  It must have been competing with a huge film cause it did not get the hype it deserves!  I loved it!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|As always, Sarah delivers powerful songs sung with honesty and conviction. It's wonderful to hear her make such a strong come-back after so many years.<br />The only good thing about her absence from the scene is that I was forced to seek out and discover so many other, similar up and coming artists like Hungry Lucy, Delerium, Kirsty Thirsk and Harland.<br />So great to hear from Sarah again though! Let's hope a tour is not far behind!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is it!  If you don't like this music, then you really can't be into the blues.  It may be acoustic, but it's got all the power, feeling and raw emotion that is Muddy Waters, from &quot;My Home Is in the Delta&quot; to the last note. The backing band is great and the sound is so good you'll think they're playing in your head.  I recommend this to anyone, not just as great blues, but as great music.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I like this CD, but its just not what I expected after 5 or 6 years of gettin ready for it to come out. Its only about 40 mins long. Every song songs about like the last one (Similar beat, similar tone, similar vocals, etc).  Theres not really that much emotion in most of the tracks. Sort of depressing sounding. Don't get me wrong, I am really glad to have a new Sarah CD in my 'possesion'. I just wish it had a little more mysterious deeper feeling with more emotion, Kind of like Building a Mystery, or Witness, or Fumbling.
B000002OCP|1.0|Like the title says, I love Muddy Waters.  I also love hard screaming rock guitars.  I love the blues, but am in no way a 'purist'.  But this just doesn't cut it for any of those categories.  Maybe it grows on you, but all I hear is constant distorted guitar &quot;wanking&quot;.  My advice is buy ANYTHING by Muddy before this, Hard Again or King of the Electric Blues are two if you like it loud and electric, Folk Singer and At Newport for just awesome blues.  If you want psychedelic blues go for Cream, or Jimi, just anything else!
0140277447|5.0|This book by Ms. Chang is an excellent recounting of the atrocities which occurred in WW2 China.<br />As for those vicious comments here refuting the book, I don't know what to say. What would one say to someone who was to deny the European Holocaust? In the face of irrefutable evidence, not even just this book, but the available documents regarding this incident, how can these events be denied? Why is this historical event denied with such a vitriolic hysteria? If it were not true, could it not be disproved objectively, and not with the \\"lies lies lies\\" that are listed here? It can't, the books which \\"refute\\" Nanking are pure fabrications themeselves; the very paradigm of modern Japanese selective amnesia. The fact that the Japanese to this day whitewash their shameful actions during WW2 only adds humiliation to those who suffered through this nightmarish event.<br />And Nanking was not the only place which was \\"raped\\" in China during this time. Let us pretend Nanking did not even occur. What of it? It was NOT the only city in China, nay, in all of Asia which was \\"raped\\" by Japan. Even if this book, which it IS NOT, was pure fabrication, it still does not excuse the actions of Japan on its neighbors. The argument that Japan was doing its Asian neighbors a favor, or was asked in by them to get rid of the Western occupying colonsits is exceedingly silly. There has not been a nation on the face of this planet in all of history which has willingly asked an enemy nation to occupy their territory.<br />To those who would berate this book, or this tragedy, based on completely unrelated contemporary Chinese actions, such as Tibet, then shame on you. A tragedy is a tragedy; if you think that Nanking is somehow justified for any other reason, I ask you how you can look at yourselves without disgust.<br />Ms. Chang has written a very objective book on the subject matter. Chang is not a historian, she is a journalist, and as such, does NOT write her book like a history book, as some people seem to expect. Also, her book is balanced, and she is VERY careful not to blame all the Japanese people for the horrible event; and she is correct in doing this. The fact that some Japanese would get mad at this book only shows how they have been brainwashed into the view that their country was a victim; it was not. It is objective, and picking at any MINOR faults it may have is truly pathetic. As said earlier, a rape in August is still a rape in September. Mutilated, raped, pregnant women in \\"site A\\" is still a tragedy in \\"site B.\\"<br />A question was raised, \\"how long must the Japanese people be sorry for this event?\\" Well, read this book, and look at the whitewashing the Japanese have done on their wartime crimes, look at the ignorance of the world to this topic, and I think you can confidently say that there has been not one once of regret concerning this event.<br />I applaud Ms. Chang for having the courage to write about such a previously unknown event, an event which has gotten many killed in Japan for asking too many questions about...For those who suggest you read revisionist books by ultra-nationalistic Japanese, I say that would be as objective as reading \\"Mein Kampf\\" for information on WW2.

B0000CD5I6|5.0|Reading the track list before this album's release, I got the impression it'd be primarily an oldies collection with a few instrumentals thrown in. All right, all right, I'll buy as much recycled material as the next Tull fanatic, but grumble grumble grumble...<br />What a pleasant surprise! <br />All new recordings of the old songs, and in some cases vastly different arrangements. The old standard &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot; is improved by the changes, in my opinion, and &quot;Last Man at the Party&quot; is hilarious. And the final verse of &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot; has some of the most breathtaking harmonies I've heard in a long while. Clearly, real effort went into giving value for money on this one. Thanks, guys, and Merry Christmas to you, too.
0316921173|5.0|I'd guess you won't like this book if you don't enjoy that first chapter (available free here.)<br />First book I've read by someone my own age that I'd rank among the best writers. Strange to see great writing by someone that grew up watching cartoons.
0793542049|4.0|This book delivers the goods.  You'll be playing good bass lines right away, and steadily adding more elements as you progress.  The book gets five stars, but <BR>I  didn't give the package five stars because the CD sounds fairly dull.  All the tracks are recorded at slow tempi without much feeling.  A few alternate takes with with faster tempi and more complex accompaniments would have been a big plus.   A nice complement to this book is Epstein's &quot;Blues Bass Handbook&quot;, which has the good grooves minus most of the music theory.
B000066C1N|5.0|Excellent music, beautiful lyrics. I love the entire soundtrack. There's not one song I don't absolutly love. In fact I'm going to buy it for a friend.
6304698798|5.0|And there it is, the three hour magnum opus and finale of the Leone / Eastwood trilogy.  Spaghetti Westerns reach their zenith in this grand epic that tracks the inter-weaving adventures of three very different, but similarly driven gunfighters in the waning days of the civil war.  The seemingly convoluted plot has Clint, Lee, and Eli racing towards a quarter million dollars in gold.  Each man holds a piece of the puzzle and needs the other to complete it.  Beautifully filmed and paced, all the sand, grit, blood and sweat combine with that haunting musical score to hold the viewer breathless.  The character studies are equally interesting, the more time we spend with the principals the less we ultimately know about them.  Brutal commentaries on the absurdities of war are as timely now as presumably they were back then, especially the bridge scenes.  Through it all, Clint rises above as the omni-powerful Blondie, always a step ahead and almost paternalistic in his treatment of Tuco.  Lee Van Cleef oozes black bile as Angel Eyes, and ranks up there in Western if not all film villainy.  It is a tiring movie to watch, the journey seems to take so long but you realize with each scene that you're seeing great directing, acting and period pieces.  It looks beautiful on widescreen TVs, definitely recommended.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I wasn't going to bother writing a review of Matrix II, being that, like 99 percent of all sequels, it failed to match the potency and creativity of its predecessor.  Sure, the special effects and action sequences are incredible.  Cool explosions, car chases, kung fu, all without taking off sunglasses or reloading. <br />Yawn.  Yeah, that's right, God forbid someone in Hollywood realize that it takes more than special effects to deliver a decent film.  For example, look at the last two Star Wars movies.<BR>Or Independence Day.  I doubt anyone over the age of 13 thinks those are vehicles worth seeing more than once.  <br />Moreover, the first hour of the movie is wretched, what with the need to show every excruciating detail about life in Zion.  So everyone there is hot and the sex is even hotter, accompanied with a techno beat.  It's so metrosexual.  Problem is I don't care about how the dishes are washed or if the wives of the crew are having a hard time dealing with the deployments.  Shoot me now.<br />Nor does the plot hold up once the intrepid crews voyage out to do battle.  Neo simply gets into impossibly one-sided scraps and then, surprise, flies away.<br />Bottom line, why does this movie stink?  Here's why -- I caught the Matrix on cable last night, which is one of those films like Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Once you start watching it, you can't tear yourself away from it.  Matrix II fits more into the Temple of Doom category -- 2 stars and consignment to the bottom of the pile of the video pile.  There's a reason TBS shows Jaws or Raiders, you know, and not the crap that followed.
B00003CX95|1.0|I can only give this movie one star, and that is because I cried so hard I can never watch it again. <br />Wonderfully made movie, however.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It would be a lie to say this was anything less than the greatest album of all time.<br />The album features the strongest vocalist of all time- not to say all that's in her vocals is strength, as she clearly shows emotional depth and range. Her songwriting skills are clearly amazing as well.<br />Album goes from faux broadway showtune (\\"The Voice Within\\"), to slow-working sultry, midtempo R&B sex schemes (\\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\") to angry heavy metal (\\"Make Over\\"), to gospel (\\"Keep Singing My Song\\") to Latin pop with a quick flamenco number in the middle (\\"Infatuation\\") and back again. And then some. Or a lot.<br />And no, the album doesn't just pick a genre and screw it on sloppily. The entire album goes on a storyline that's like a journal for the listener.<br />One of my personal favorites from the album is \\"Loving Me 4 Me,\\" which is somewhere inbetween one of those alternative rock female's ballads, and one of the neo soul (think Floetry or Jill Scott) slow-working jams. The song sounds like parts of it could be sang by Alanis Morisette or Jill Scott, and that No Doubt may have wanted it. None of these 3 artists could have brought it have the justice Christina did, not just because she wrote it- but because he voice hits around every crack and corner in every song she sings. She doesn't really belt in this song, and is even more subdued than she was in \\"Beautiful,\\" but sounds incredibly amazing. Stripped.
B00008J4P5|2.0|ok, while i cant say this album completely [stinks], as there are things about it i can appreciate, but mostly i find this album incredibly boring.....<BR>Seven Nation Army has a cool groove...but i agree with another reviewer that its too repetitive for its own good....PRETTY GOOD...<br />Black Math - i think i wrote this song when i was 2 years old and got that play guitar from my unlce.....BORING!!!!!<br />There's No Home For You here - this song is pretty cool, i like this one, but still nothing great....<br />I dont know what to do with myself - BORING....while not terrible, its just blah....i mean come on, is the object to write songs with as little effort as possible and see if people will listen? its like throwing spaghetti at the wall to see if its done<br />In The Cold Cold Night - this song could be cool if they would give it a little more umpff...i mean put some ass in it Meg, i know you got it<br />I want to be the boy...- this song is ok, but like the others, i think i wrote this one when i was 3<br />you've got her in your pocket - this song is pretty good, but still doesnt rise up from the ground for me<br />Ball and Biscuit - is that balls i hear jack getting, ok this one comes close to making me want to listen more than once<br />hardest Button to bUTTON - this song is pretty figgin cool, maybe the best so far<br />Little acorns - this song is pretty rockin' i can go for this one...i can at least feel some sort of passion in these last 2 songs.....<br />Hypnotize - this song is ok, but still BORING!!!<br />The Air Near My fingers - some pretty hip sections to this song, fun vocals<br />Girl You have no Faith in Medicine - i mean i really applaude these guys for what they come up with with what sounds like little effort, but doesnt make for a fun listen to me BORING!!!!<br />Its true that we love each other - oh how cute....<br />ok come on....how this album is so popular is beyond me....<BR>its somewhat fresh, but still boring....is that possible?fresh and boring?? that what i think ....and on the other hand, its not that fresh...can you say Velvet Underground???? Iggy Pop????<br />wish i listened to this cd before i bought it....<br />in reading the responses of others, i felt the urge to come back and add that, while i dont think this album is terrible, i just dont care for it, i can appreciate that these guys are doing whats true to them and all...but to me, some people people make sounds and some people make music, both are equally relevant, but i prefer music more often than sounds, this album is more a collage of sounds, which bores me after a while......
B0000DCGT3|5.0|i'm a fan of the series and thought this would stink because nadia was gone. i missed her but it is still so much better than the first two. i laughed at every gag and was even offended by one of them. good ending to a great series.
B00000K19E|1.0|I realize alot of people think this movie is good, but, you're wrong. Normally, I like to see other sides to stories, but now. These are just updated Kung Fu movies...except..they suck.. And c'mon.. Keanu Reeves?! Why would you cast &quot;Ted&quot; as an action star?!
6304119046|5.0|I have always heard that Orson Well's Citizen Kane was a good movie, however, after watching it I am inclined to say that it is a wonderful movie. It teaches a very valuable lesson that everyone should learn at one time or another. Whether your 12 or 120, you should watch this movie. Granted its a little long, and in black in white, but don't let that hold you back from watching it. It definately illustrates the moral that Money Can't Buy Happiness.
B000002N2Z|5.0|A must have for any collection. Around The Fur is my personal favorite of there albums, but you cannot go wrong with this one. I bought this C.D in 1995 and I still play it on a daily basis. The riffs are catchy, durms are pounding, and Chino grabs you with his gentle yet blood curdling screams. Lifter is my favorite title on this one. There are no disapointments on the whole C.D. The first time you listen to it you might not think its great. I loved it from the start. But give it a few trys, I guarantee you will love it. Deftones have staying power in the music world. And this C.D is no different.
B00008J4P5|5.0|What do you get when you start two ppl jamming indie/garage music with just two instruments at hand? (one each ofcourse) Well anyone who hasn't heard The White Stripes might think out of tune and not enough rythem music, but oh no, BEWARE! Now, you dont actually have to possess two guitarists and a bass player to create and do music like The White's do. Jack at vocals and guitar and Meg at drums (and backing) makes them unique and original. Yes that's right, as good as it gets. Following up with their success in White Blood Cells they still had the nerves to do it once more for the love of the music (Damn indies!!!) Lets just not forget that we still don't know if they're ex lovers or siblings. Hopefully they'll reveal once and for all the answer to this mystery. Mmmmm....ehh maybe not, just keep making good music guys!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Before there was the The Wall (Over embellished/pretentious Floyd), before there was [] Momentary Lapse of Reason, The Division Bell (What I Consider Paint by numbers Floyd i.e. see P.U.L.S.E.!), There was good ole Pink Floyd, ie DSotM, Wish You Were Here and their Masterpiece the Angry and political Animals.<BR>    Before this time Pink Floyd was hungry, had something to say and was looking for a direction, a vision if you like. Their early work was summed up perfectly with the release of this DVD.<BR>It was not cropped like some may have you believe, the original was released 16:9 in theaters not 4:3 in VHS that was done later for the vhs release. The theatrical release came first. Also. not all of the songs are shot in Italy, Eugene,Nobs and STCFTHOTS were filmed in London because they ran out of time while in Italy and you can see them in a dark sound stage. It still makes this bloody DVD brilliant, and even though it is only stereo, wait until you hear echoes and careful with that axe eugene thru your DVD players surround sound. OMG, it is unreal!!!!Again, for just the sound alone it would have been worth it for the asking price. You can pretty much learn the entire song of echoes on guitars just from camera positions.<BR>   Now to address some additions added into the film that were not there before. there are some space/planet features that are kinda confusing, as well as the CGI art of how Pompeii would have looked, which is not a bad idea given the whole concept of the \\"Pompeii\\" thing. Even the planet thing didn't bother me after the second viewing, and I am a die hard Floyd fan. I have a european version of the See Emily Play 45 Single that Syd drew of the \\"Choo Choo Train\\", though I must admit I am glad that they developed there own style and let the Beatles be the Beatles.<BR>    It was somwhere in between a Saucerful of Secrets and the release of Meddle, particularly the line in Echoes starts everything special in Floyd to come, by its obsurdness and obscurness thatr makess it so wonderfull... <BR>\\"...strangers passing in the street by chance two separate glances meet, for I am you and what I see is me\\"...<BR>(That happens every fricken day !!!)<br />Next Note:<BR>   Now I know they have have complete Live AUDIO/VIDEO Recordings of Dark Side of the Moon 1972-1974 tours, Wish You Were Here 1975 tours and Animals 1977 In the Flesh tours. If Jimmy Page can work his magic with his masters for both the DVD and How the West Was Won and that footage is older than yours(PF's). What is stopping you, third party Pink Floyd footage is nice. But we would rather se see something directly from Roger/Dave/Nick/Rick/Strom/EMI and best of, making of classic album DVD isn't cutting it any more, you have released, DSotM like 80 times allready, how about a live animals tour or a live DSotM 1972 Hollywood Bowl Tour. A nice DVD 5 1/2 hour Package is what we want. Not a 1/2 hour BBC VH1 presentastion is what we want.<br />The Pompeii Video is worth every penny, just a shame they will rip us off with a Pulse DVD or a Delicate Sound of Thunder DVD.<BR>Its a shame, cause you are my favorite muscian Mr. Gilmour
B000000XB9|5.0|this is a must have classic rock album and i agree with the others about bayou but don't forget they left out midnight special which is really good and an early one hello mary lou any ways i just wanted to mention these other two songs but buy this cd!!!
B00008PW2E|5.0|Silently, I creep deeper and deeper into my eventual home six feet under from where I am now...RELEASE SEASON TWO AND THREE before it's too late!!!
B00005JKES|5.0|If watching this series for the first time, think about this: this show pre-dates The X-Files, Northern Exposure, Six Feet Under, and all of those forensics/crime/mystery shows by years-- and far surpasses them in quality.  13 years later, people are still in love with this series, still quoting it, still re-living life in that cursed and blessed town; directors are still strip-mining the imagery and writers attempting to capture the hilarious and often hyper-soap operatic dialog.  In 13 years, will anybody even remember CSI Miami?<BR>Yes, it is infuriating that the second season has yet to be released on DVD.  Yes, the show has plotlines and characters that will annoy the hell out of you and seem dated and grating.  Yes, David Lynch confounds the mind and at times is funny wihout intending to be.  All of these are valid complaints.  (As for the \\"Where's the pilot?\\" one-- just go ahead and buy it if you feel you need it.  It's not part of the episodic broadcast, and is not a linear necessity to the enjoyment or underdstanding of the show.)<BR>Complain if you must.  Personally, I am grateful to own a piece of the most beautiful American television series ever to air, with cleaned up audio and super-clear picture, to boot.  <BR>What matters about this show is the care and sensitivity with which the show is written, acted, and directed.  It is a beautiful show, and frightening and touching and engrossing, because it exposes characters equally capable of great good and terrible evil, often in the same scene.  The way this show manipulates your sympathies is brilliant.  One moment, you are thinking \\"Bobby is a dishonest brute;\\" the next, you are seeing him in tears, seemingly the victim of Laura's sick manipulation, and honestly feeling for him.  Lynch manipulates us in the same way Laura manipulated her loved ones, forcing us to look at the ugly and the sublime, and the collision of the two.<BR>I don't think we ever saw dead bodies or autopsies in such a stylized mannerbefore Twin Peaks.  I don't think we ever saw an ironic hard-boiled detective before Dale Cooper.  Forensic Investigation and FBI work were matters for documentaries.  Evening soaps were the realm of war stories or rich teens.  I don't think scripts included dialog centered around such mundane topics as pie and coffee before this show, nor was there room on television for extended dream sequences.  Twin Peaks vastly expanded the scope of what television could be.<BR>So, I will wait for the second season.  Meanwhile, I will repeatedly watch this gothic, sexy, soap-opera-on-opium, fairy-tale-on-coke, graphic, sad, funny, and inimitable collection.<BR>And oh yeah-- BOB still scares the bejesus out of me.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Last night, when i got home from one of the worst days of work I walked straight through the door without checking the mail.  When I realized this, I went straight to the mail box, where streetcore was waiting for me.  I ran back up the steps to my apartment, poored myself a strong Jack and Coke, and listened to the my new cd straight through.  This is probably the best album I have ever bought, I even think it beats out some of the clash's stuff (yes, I have them all, and have been a fan since I got Combat Rock at a ripe 6 years old).  Everything is fresh and new, with an energy and dedication that I haven't heard in any artist before.  But let's not trake credit from the mescaleros.  The arrangements are great, the music and lyrics are sheer poetry.  Joe will truly be missed.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Wow!  This album is the most soul searching, heart pulling one Sarah has produced.  So many good ones here - Fallen (of course), World On Fire, Answer, Perfect Girl and Dirty Little Secret.<br />I'm all about lyrics painting emotions that are hard to express.  Lots of personal interpretation and comfort in these songs.  This album has been worth waiting for.<br />Be warned - not a lot of fast tracks here - more soulful tones and thoughtful prose.<br />Loved this album.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Performed by some of today's best singers, this multi-Grammy Award winner is a marvelous addition to any country/folk music collection. Some of these artists are at the top of their field, but some will be &quot;discoveries&quot; for most of us, like the beautiful rendition of &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot; by Chris Thomas King, a versatile young man who is versed in many styles, and here sings in the old blues tradition and does it brilliantly.<br />The highlights for me are: The legendary Ralph Stanley, with his plaintive acappella chant of &quot;O Death&quot;, which carries with it all the pain and soul of  Appalachia, and the purity of &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; by the Soggy Bottom Boys, who consist of Union Station member Dan Tyminsky on lead vocals and guitar, backed by Harley Allen and Pat Enright. For anyone who likes traditional music, you can't get any better than this.<br />Another acappella gem is &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby&quot;, with Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, and Gillian Welch with harmonies that sound as if they came from another era. Everything on this disc recalls days gone by; there is a refreshing simplicity, and a lot of the songs are filled with faith.<br />There is exquisite musicianship on this CD, and it is a nice long one at 60'34 minutes.  The booklet insert is something I appreciate too; it is a collage of yellowed stained paper on peeling walls, with a terrific layout, and as it says on one of its pages, &quot;Old-Time Music Is Very Much Alive&quot;.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I really love this album. From the Intro to the Outro. She brought this new live band style to the table. Which you can play this album at family gathering and romantic night out. Keep it up Erykah I like this new style from you.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I liked this movie much more than Chicago. Chicago was very well done and enjoyable, but i thought it was over-hyped, and I didn't like Queen Latifah at all in that movie and thought they should have cast someone else. The rest of the cast was perfect. Now, onto All That Jazz:This is a truely great movie and very well directed and cast. I can't imagine anyone but Roy Scheider in the roll of Joe Gideon. He plays a very believable choreographer who is a womanizer, sex addict, drug addict, alcoholic and workaholic, who eventually burns himself out from exhaustion while trying to put together a musical production, and suffers a heart attack and dies. The movie is actually a musical about his death. Jessica Lang plays the character of \\"Death\\". It's nice that Death is represented by a beautiful angelic woman in white, instead of a scary grim reaper. The song and dance numbers are great and very memorable. I love the music in this movie! My older brother was an usher at the theatre at the time this movie played, and he saw it over 40 times and bought the soundtrack album. It's probably his favorite movie of all time. Although this movie is billed as a musical comedy, i viewed it as more of a serious drama about a very talented and charismatic man who suffered from many addictions and paid the price for it in his personal life.  Highly recommended movie, and Roy Scheider's performance is mesmorizing to watch. The dance sequence called \\"Air-otica\\" is a very sensual dance number you won't soon forget! This movie is on my personal list of the 100 greatest films of all time.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|What an incredible disappointment!  I love Badu.  The power and authority she usually sings with was missing here.  This CD is boring without any complexity or excitement.  I think she phoned this one in.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|CATCHY is the key word with the Strokes.  Not GROUNDBREAKING.  Not REVOLUTIONARY.  Not VELVET UNDERGROUND (because Lou Reed wasn't always catchy.  Think I'm wrong?  Listen to &quot;The Black Angel's Death Song&quot; 20 times in a row and see if you don't want to throw your stereo out the window). <br />The Strokes truly define CATCHY.  The reliable drums, the expert guitars, precise as ever, driving infectious melody.  The lyrics don't sound like they care one way or another.  &quot;Don't wanna be forgotten.  Don't wanna be reminded&quot;  Even the hair, the clothes, the voice, all preordained to require a minimal amount of effort.  It doesn't even sound as if they put any work into the album, but for some reason I get the feeling that it does take quite a bit of tinkering to perfect the impression, or the illusion, of carelessness.  <br />But why analyze the grand mystique that is the Strokes when you can just pop in the CD and turn it up?
B00005ASIL|5.0|This CD is an excellent buffet of Jethro Tull music. A little bit of everything. Tasty!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|What a timeless piece of art!  What a voice!  What a collection of lyrics and melodies!! You really feel like you are hanging out in her living room listening to a private concert.  Well worth the long wait.  Next thing to look forward to from Sarah is the tour!!!
B0000C8AQM|5.0|The music is great but one song seems to be missing. Does anybody know the name of the song that goes<BR>          The legend of the rent was way hardcore
B000002MG1|5.0|this album takes me away everytime I hear it. It is perfect in every way possible. I would like to quickly point out that a couple reviews below me cranky reviewer has given this one star. I read some other reviews of his and i have found that not only has he given britney spears five stars but claims oasis inspired the beatles and the who ripped them off. The Beatles came first jack a$$. Anyways Automatic is not only the best R.E.M album but maybe one of the best albums of the ninieties. If you dont have it you are wasting your life.
B000053V9F|5.0|This is one of the all-time great movies.<br />First, even if you don't buy the entire conspiracy as presented by Stone, it is a wonderful lesson in US history and politics and citizenship.<br />Second, it is just wonderfully entertaining.  The cast is superb.  Not only is it all-star, but Stone has somehow managed to cast against type and get wonderful performances.  He casts Ed Asner, a liberal in real life, as a stone-age murderous rightwing fruitcake.  He casts rockjawed Tommy Lee Jones as the swishy effeminate Clay Shaw.  He casts usually tough-as-nails self-sufficient Sissy Spacek as timid hausfrau Mrs. Garrison.  He casts Kevin Costner, real-life rightwinger, as partisan of JFK and nemesis of the Military Industrial Complex.  He even casts Jim Garrison himself as Earl Warren, the Supreme Court Justice who denounces Jim Garrison!<br />And they all deliver wonderful performances.  So does almost everybody in the movie.<br />I believe that Oswald was not solely guilty, that there must have been some kind of wider gallery of shooters.  But unlike Stone, I don't think the killing of one president, however charismatic, really did change or really could change US history much.  The US is an oligarchy, of by and for the wealthy, and that isn't likely to change.<br />But the movie is wonderfully inspiring, and almost Capraesque in its faith in democracy.  Everyone, particularly those too young to have witnessed Kennedy's death, should see it.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|A very simular album to their first but did that mean the Ramones second album or the Clash second albums were bad? No it doesnt. Room On Fire changes very little from the signature sound that made critics and hard core music fans alike love Is This It their 2001 debut. Room On Fire is more of the same stuff. The band sticks to their sound and they clearly wanted to as they gave up recording with Radioheads producer and instead went with Is This It Producer Gordon Rapheal. The result this time -- another great record. Without a doubt the Strokes are the most brilliant and influencial band of the new millenium so far. Music is slowly breaking out of the hangover it has suffered from since 1994 when Cobain committed suicide. The Strokes wont have the success of the band I just mentioned (Nirvana for those of you who didnt experience early 90's) but they will have the success of lets say the Pixies, the Clash, and the band they most often get compared to - the Velvet Underground. I doubt this album will sell over a million copies - their first one didnt. Who cares, 98% of great music doesnt sell over a million. Their are 1 million true hard core music fans in the United States - 80% of them own a Strokes record. That is why they will become legendary and will be known as the most important band from this era in rock music. An era which looks bad if you look at the mainstream but no one remembers the mainstream in 20 years - they just mock it in tv shows like &quot;i love the 80's&quot; - you don't ever see Micheal Ian Black make fun of the Pixies now do you??? <br />Is this it was the best record of 2001 and so far Room on Fire is looking to be one of the if not the best of 2003. No need to mention song titles - just go buy the record. But only if you are one of those million. If you aren't - then stay away from the Strokes and go buy Linkin Park or Justin Timberlake.
B00005RHGK|5.0|The tension in this piece of cinematography  is built up and conveyed superbly- the Creeper's van looms casually into view, just like a normal vehicle, until it lets out a harsh, grinding blare of noise , and we know instantly that the driver is up to no good.<BR>The identity of the killer is revealed with excellant subtlety- the two main charectars see a shadowy figure drop what appears to be a body down a pipe, and we don't see his face very clearly till near the end..<BR>The hepless isolation of being stranded away from home with a monstrous figure after you is conveyed magnificently by the two main charectars.<BR>I know that a lot of noise has been made about the revelation half-way through about the killer's identity- he is eventually revealed to be some kind of cannibalistic demon called the Creeper, with immense strength.<BR>Before we know who he is, however, we are given hints about his supernatural identity via how he drives from the cafe to the church in such a short time.<br />Personally, I no problem with the charectar turning out to be some kind of monster.<BR>The ending is a bit grim, but this is still a great horror film.
B00005JKZU|1.0|Meaning well, a being of some power is seduced by the Ring.  This being obtains their objective, becoming very powerful, and overthrowing Sauron as the new Dark Lord, controlling Middle-Earth!  Who is this being?  It's Peter Jackson!  Meaning to create a trilogy of movies of a great, classic fantasy, the temptation of Jackson's ego becomes too great, and he creates his OWN Lord of the Rings...bringing to the screen something that only partially resembles the classic book.<br />But my main objective of this review is to point out that there are significant differences between this movie and the book it's based on, and to those people that have not read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" book(s), to please read the book.  There are those that have read the book and seen the movie - some may like both or like the movie better...that is their rightful opinion.  I now consider myself a \\"Tolkien purist\\"...I didn't know I was one before Jackson's movies came out, but, being that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is my favorite book, I was expecting spectacular movies in all aspects.  I was disappointed with the first movie, but I am infuriated with this second movie.  First let me state, that by definition, a real Tolkien purist cannot like this \\"The Two Towers\\" movie.  A purist cannot tolerate any deviations, except, maybe, for the understandable & necessary condensing/consolidating needed to bring a book to the screen.  After reading his biography, JRR Tolkien was the first & foremost Tolkien purist!  He sold the movie rights 30+ years ago...never imagining a film or films could really be done. He would never have even bothered to see any movies...unless, I think, they got rave reviews and included every bit of dialogue, story, and descriptions in his book...a series of movies that probably would've totaled over 50 hours!  He would not have been sympathetic to any changes needing to be done to bring his book to the screen.<br />The positives of this movie:<br />Gollum; especially when his good side argues with his bad side.  When his good side wins out temporarily until he feels betrayed by Frodo and then his bad side wins out, this the best example of positive artistic license!  Book to movie comment: takes a few seconds to bring this out more than the book.  (A personal rating: I give Gollum +5 points)<br />Arwen sees in her mind's eye what the future will be like after Aragorn dies when her father Elrond tells her she'll regret her choice for Aragorn/mortality.  Book to movie comment: this is described in the Appendix, adding time, but I thought it was perfectly done! (+1)<br />Acting, with the exception of Faramir, is great! (+1)<br />Visuals (costumes, special effects, settings, cinematography). Book to movie comment: these are exceptional! (+3)<br />The neutrals in this movie:<br />King Theoden being possessed by Saruman.  An example of acceptable artistic license...some may find it great.  Book to movie comment: may add a few seconds to Theoden's transformation back to being the real King of Rohan. (0)<br />The negatives in this movie:<br />Saruman being a complete lackey of Saruon's, thus leading to Merry & Pippin's escape because of the orc fight because Grishnakh wants to eat them?!  Book to movie comment: Grishnakh is a Mordor orc, Ugluk is an Isengard orc - the orc fight occurs when more Mordor orcs arrive and Grishnakh is under orders to bring the hobbits to Sauron, while Ugluk is under orders to bring them to Saruman.  That's because Saruman covets the ring for himself and, once he's got it, would've challenged Sauron.  I don't see why there's this difference because it wouldn't have added time to the movie and unnecessarily takes away complexity that's in the book.  (-4)<br />Wargs attack Aragorn & Riders on way to Helm's Deep, and Aragorn falls over a height into a river.  Book to movie comment: not in the book & takes a few minutes that could've been spent bringing out more of the book. (-1)<br />Elves at Helm's Deep and death of Haldir.  Book to movie comment: not in the book and takes up more time, plus Haldir doesn't die at all! (-2)<br />Merry & Pippin make Treebeard take them past Isengard resulting in the Ents attack.  Book to movie comment: the Ents make the decision to attack Saruman on their own in their Entmoot.  I can't understand at all why this was done, and it changes the character of the Ents.  They are tree-herders, and are sensitive enough to know when Saruman's orcs are killing trees.  And the trees/Ents were very significant to Tolkien himself! (-5)<br />Eomer leads the Riders that help turn the tide at Helm's Deep.  Book to movie comment: Erkenbrand leads the Riders while Eomer fights in Helm's Deep.  Women have few significant roles in the book.  I think it would've been great to have Dernhelm lead the Riders! (-1 for the lost opportunity)<br />Faramir decides to take Frodo, Sam, & Gollum to his father in Gondor, and the subsequent confrontation with a Nazgul.  Book to movie comment: this was the most infuriating difference...it takes several minutes, too!  Faramir is almost the exact opposite of his brother, Boromir.  He shows significant wisdom by avoiding the Ring and letting the hobbits go.  The encounter with the Nazgul is absurd!  While this MAY set up scenes in the next movie (why Mordor's first attack is at Faramir in Osgiliath), it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense that after one Nazgul was thwarted why the rest wouldn't immediately be upon the Ring-bearer...not to mention the Eye of Sauron! (-7)<br />All other little differences between the book & movie in the story line or dialogue, including Arwen leaving Rivendell to sail West. (-3)<br />When added up, my personal ratings total (-13), and that's the reason why I don't like this movie.  I will not contribute any more money directly to Jackson & his cronies via theatre or video, because money is what they understand most.  The movies have gotten a lot more people to read the book...that's great!  I hope I can also get more people to read the book by pointing out how different this movie is.ok to movie comment: not in the book and takes up more time, plus Haldir doesn't die at all!

B0000C0FJB|4.0|My two favorite bands have just put out great new releases. Rush, Live in Rio and<BR>Deep Purple, Bananas. Both groups are in wonderful form. Deep Purple in the studio and<BR>Rush on stage. The Live in Rio sound quality is a bit rough, but the ears adjust quickly enough and I forgot all about the bootleg like sound quality. The song selection is pretty good and the performances are simply excellent. The crowd is one of the key reasons to hear this collection, making for a very exciting listening experience. I would have loved more songs from the current studio album, Vapor Trails. The live versions (arrangements) are so much better than the studio versions. I was not a fan of  Vapor Trails by any means. I gave it a lot of chances too, but it made me feel like listening to their music was a chore, not a good sign. <br />On the other end of the spectrum is Bananas by Deep Purple. Here is an album I thought was going to be so-so, but...WOW!!! What a rock-solid album. What a GREAT album!!!<BR>It is everything that Vapor Trails wasn't in my opinion. Great songs, marvelous arrangements, outstanding musicianship, wonderful production and a perfect running order. There is no middle or late album slump, not one song worth skipping. All the musicians magazines and Amazon reviewers are praising Bananas as well, so I am not alone on this one. If only other legendary bands (Rolling Stones, AC/ZZ etc.) could put out something this good, maybe the record industry wouldnt be in such a bind.<br />P.S. It is great to have my two favorite bands still putting out great product after all these years. I hope Rush try and make another album and I hope Deep Purple come to town early next year.<br />Live in Rio: 4 stars<BR>BANANAS: 5 stars
B00005JKED|5.0|Ignore the folks who are carping about the plot.  The plot is an afterthought designed to move a brilliant performance (Denzel Washington) and a very good one (Ethan Hawke) from beginning to end.  (In fact, to the extent that the plot relies on a dime-store twist to avoid Jake Hoyt's getting his melon blown off in a bathtub, it's not even very GOOD.)  But the acting is superb, and Washington's performance in the last 15 minutes truly virtuoso.  Buy it.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is my favorite show to watch on the WB, so naturally I was elated to see the first season released on DVD.  I actually became a fan midway through the second season, so I was unsure about early events in the show.  These DVDs cleared everything up for me, thankfully, and while the special features left a little to be desired, all in all it's a great buy.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love sarah mclachlan Surfacing...this highly anticipate album is worth of waiting ....every song in the album is so beautiful..drifting and fallen is my favorite. Highly recommend to buy this album... A++
0767824571|5.0|Hurrah!  Hooray!  The greatest, funniest film of all time!  I must say, to me the movie looked boring and, well...stupid when I first heard about it.  But then I watched it, and was instantly converted.<br />If you have never seen any Monty Python productions (which I hadn't, when I first watched this movie) then you're in for a humorous surprise.  What other company could come up with such wonderful songs as &quot;Bravely Bold Sir Robin&quot;?  What other company could create a Trojan Jackrabbit and the famous Killer Rabbit?  And to those who don't like the ending - it's Monty Python!  What else did you expect?<br />Anyway, if you love movies that can laugh at themselves, and films that purposefully appear cheap and low budget for their own amusement, you'll LOVE Monty Python and the Holy Grail!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Dark and beautiful.  Those are really the best terms to describe &quot;Afterglow&quot;... ten melancholy pop gems that showcase Sarah McLachlan's bewitching vocals and sad lyrics.  It's easy to understand why the album is so downbeat in places; Sarah lost her mother and took a break to avoid burnout, and it shows in tracks like &quot;Fallen&quot;,&quot;Drifting&quot;, &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;, and the post-September 11 downer &quot;World on Fire&quot;.  But in spite of all the angst, the songs ring true; there are complicated arrangements and stirring melodic hooks that only begin to reveal themselves after several listens.  The overall pace of the album is pretty even, with a pair of shimmering piano ballads (&quot;Answer&quot;, &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;), a mellow jazz/funk tune &quot;Train Wreck&quot;, and the sweeping shadowy pop of &quot;Fallen&quot;, &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;Drifting&quot;.  Gone are the trip-hop textures of her earlier work; this album is more mature, sophisticated, and emotionally layered than earlier recordings.  I'm sure it's only a matter of time before we hear these tunes on the soundtracks of &quot;Alias&quot; or &quot;Smallville&quot;, unfortunately, but until VH-1 and angsty college kids claim them as their own, bathe in the dark beauty that is Sarah McLachlan's music.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Having only heard a little from this album via radio airplay, I snapped it up based mostly on Sarah's past track record, her talent precedes her, and I wasn't disappointed. <BR>Her hiatus was long, and I must say this newest effort was well worth the wait. She continues to craft heart touching lyrics and multi-level melodies and I know this will become a new favorite in my Sarah collection.<BR>Thank you Sarah, for your wonderful gift of expression, your angelic voice, your tapestry of words. They're precious and savored, every morsel.
B000001EL7|3.0|For many Kiss fans, this album was where it started and, unfortunately, ended as well. Originally released in 1977, Love Gun revealed a new Kiss look - more glitter, more stylized, more upscale - which moved them from the rougher, more menacing imagery of the past. No surprise then that the music had undergone a similar transformation. Gone were crackling demonic testaments to underworlds, virgin souls, perverted doctors and head-on accident victims. Love Gun - a cheapened reference to a (...) with  most of the songs not-so-sly metaphors for sheet-rattling perversions of the kind only millionaire rock stars could enjoy. Sex was nothing new to Kiss songsheets, but here it took on a weird, twisted life of its own. Plaster Caster detailed the work of a group of groupies famous for casting the wigglies of rock stars in plaster. Shock Me, with its lazy rhymes and wizened chorus, celebrated a love of bondage and leather, while Got Love For Sale... well, love in Kissworld was always a synonym for sex and it didn't take a worldview to know the band were singing about hookers. In between these odes to debauchery, lurid tales of stalking young girls (Christine Sixteen), deflowering virgins (I Stole Your Love) and of course the title track and all it's juvenile penis-obsessed phrase-twisting. Worse, someone in an ego-addled display of stupidity decided to close the album with an old '50s singalong (Then She Kissed Me), which, despite it's obvious nod to the band, proved a disturbing snapshot of just how bad things were yet to get. Small wonder then Peter Criss' swinging Hooligan stood out as the album's better tracks. Small wonder too that when this album came out, new recruits raced to the band's back catalogue to soak up the wonders to behold on the first Alive album, Dressed to Kill, Hotter than Hell, Destroyer and Rock and Roll Over. Aside from the obvious bathroom wall sentiments, musically Love Gun is an abomination of over-polished pop and anemic anthems, not a tune ofwhich stands out among Kiss' better work. For four fellows who prided themselves so obviously on their after-dark pursuits beneath the sheets, Love Gun is a limp and pathetic chink in the armour of a band who had all started taking themselves much too seriously. Pity.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This album is so diverse that it's refreshing. The BEP's are a diverse group from different nationalites so it's only natural that their album will reflect that. Before knowing this I shyed away from the album after listening to 'Where is the Love'(which is a great and profound song by the way)thinking that the whole album was just as serious but it really suprised me and now i'm finding myself keeping this album on repeat. <br />As for the song 'Let's get Retarded' the word retarted is slang for wilding out- having a good time- getting crazy. Sure it's not the greatest word to describe having fun but it mentions to not take it personal in the begining anyway so chill.
B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie is just awful. The bleakness of the story line is  only slightly worse than the emptiness and vapidity of the acting. The love story between Banner and his girl-friend (Connelly) lacks any warmth or interest. And what should have been a powerful relationship between Banner and his father ends up ragged, confused, and senseless.<br />For those old enough to have enjoyed either the Stan Lee comics or the TV show, ignore this movie. It is but a poor reflection of a creative and engaging sotry. This weak rendition will leave you empty and disappointed.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|No question this is a better collection than &quot;Shaking the Tree.&quot;  &quot;Hit&quot; brings together most (yes, most) of Peter Gabriel's best solo material (if you're looking for Genesis stuff, try their first boxed set).  The real bonus to this set are the soundtrack and more obscure tracks like &quot;The Tower that Ate People&quot; and &quot;Father, Son&quot;.<br />There is a ton of material on here from &quot;Up&quot;, which is interesting considering is only came out last year.  The alternate mix of &quot;Growing Up&quot; is quite good though.  &quot;Burn You Up, Burn You Down&quot; is a track that didn't make the US version of &quot;Up.&quot;  Nice to see it here.<br />Unlike &quot;Shaking the Tree&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; *did* make this collection!  However, as good as this set is, there are blatant omissions.  The UK version has &quot;DIY&quot;, &quot;Different Drum&quot;, &quot;No Self Control&quot;, &quot;Washing of the Water,&quot; and &quot;I Have the Touch&quot; instead of &quot;I Don't Remember&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Family Snapshot,&quot; and &quot;Love to Be Loved.&quot;  (Yes, we yanks got one less track.)<br />In my opinion, &quot;DIY&quot; and &quot;I Have the Touch&quot; should be on the US version.  Also, I can do without a live version of &quot;Downside Up&quot;.  &quot;Come Talk to Me&quot; would have been a better track from &quot;Us&quot; than &quot;Love to Be Loved&quot; too.  A nice nugget for this collection would have been &quot;Modern Love.&quot;  Songs like &quot;That Voice Again&quot;, &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot; and the studio version of &quot;Ga-Ga&quot; would also have been great bonuses.  While &quot;Passion&quot; is a good listen, I was happy to see no tracks from it here.  Those songs have a completely different feel.<br />All complaints aside, this is an excellent place to start for new PG fans, and a good catch-almost-all for the casual fan.  You get to hear a lot of what made Peter the giant that he is today, plus some more artistic moments.  If you want his experimental material, check out the first three self-titled albums.<br />&quot;Hit&quot; is also a fabulously sounding collection.  The production on all the tracks is pristine.

B00007G1ZC|5.0|A brilliant film. The movie is composed of eight dreams, however it flows very nicely, so there is never a sense of hesitation between each of the transitions. It was beautifully filmed and directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa and probably one of his best works ever. I highly recommend this film!
B000002UE9|4.0|After doing a more or less straight cover of KISS's \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" for the Less Than Zero soundtrack, the bad boys of Poison released their second album, Open Up And Say Ahh!, which got into a bit of a controversy because of the album cover.  So what's the big deal about a scraggly haired demonic green-eyed woman  with a long tongue sticking out?  Apparently a lot to the censorship folks.  The edited album cover was a narrow strip that merely showed the eyes and orange slightly below and above.  Fortunately, I manged to snag the unedited cover.<br />\\"Love On The Rocks\\" recalls Motley Crue and Cinderella, only not as hard as those two groups, but a good enough dose of rock and roll and swaggering bedroom antics.  Another track Diamond Dave would be proud of.<br />\\"Nothin' But A Good Time\\" was a good choice for the first single although not as rowdy as the first single from their debut.  The theme of blowing one's hard-earned money for a good time to compensate for an unsatisfying job is shown clearly here.  The part before the final chorus run-through is a favorite.  After CC's solo, comes the rhythmic thumping of the drums in measured time.<br />Going \\"Back To The Rocking Horse\\" seems like a good idea to me.  After a brief been-there, done-that explanation, the narrator longs not only for a simpler time but to start all over again.  Gosh, the things I'd do if I had the chance, and the world had better look out!  A worthy rocker.<br />A bluesy harmonica and beats owing nods to to \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\" is displayed on \\"Good Love,\\" which is to the girl of the song what petrol is to a car.  The lifestyle led by the couple in this leads neighbours saying \\"the things you're doing ain't natural, boy.\\"<br />The naughtiest and hardest rocking non-single track here is \\"Look But You Can't Touch\\" about his trying to seduce a young thing who later doesn't seem quite as innocent as all that.  When he sings \\"I didn't plan on spending money just to get a piece of mind\\", he emphasizes the word \\"mind\\", making me think, \\"Yeah, as opposed to something rhyming with mass.\\"  The guitar squeals in time when he sings that he gets slapped in face for making an illegal move.<br />\\"Fallen Angel\\", the second single, is about a small-town girl whose dreams of show business includes a life in the fast lane, \\"rolling the dice of her life.\\"<br />A heartfelt sigh opens the heartbreaking \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\", their first #1 song and a mature ballad looking back at a blown chance to make or break a relationship.  After words like \\"like the knife that cuts you/the wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains,\\" I thought, \\"And these guys did 'Talk Dirty To Me' two years ago?\\"  This really set the standard for their other great ballad, Flesh & Blood's \\"Something To Believe In\\"<br />Then comes a cover of Loggins and Messina's \\"Your Mama Don't Dance,\\" which is good old fashioned rock and roll from the 70's.  By the time this single came out, hard on the heels of the previous one, the album had run its course, hence its failing to make the Top Ten.<br />Things get slower, the sound lacking the ferocity of Look What The Cat Dragged In, which results in a few filler tracks, compensated for by \\"Every Rose...\\" but Bret Michael's swaggering bad-boy, play all night with beautiful women tone, is still here.  Worthy followup to their debut.  And when is EMI going to reissue that original cover for everyone?ce of mind\\", he emphasizes the word \\"mind\\", making me think, \\"Yeah, as opposed to something rhyming with mass.\\"  The guitar squeals in time when he sings that he gets slapped in face for making an illegal move.  <br />\\"Fallen Angel\\", the second single, is about a small-town girl whose dreams of show business includes a life in the fast lane, \\"rolling the dice of her life.\\"<br />A heartfelt sigh opens the heartbreaking \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\", their first #1 song and a mature ballad looking back at a blown chance to make or break a relationship.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Every few years, a film transcends the directorial boundaries set before it and asks audiences to disavow their universal cinematic expectations. If successful, these pictures become the new artistic standard and send the entire film industry scrambling back to the drawing board. Quentin Tarantino's 4th film, Kill Bill, is one of these, accomplishing more in each of its minutes than most films do in their entirety.<br />There are millions of movies. Why is Kill Bill any more profound than Crouching Tiger, the Good the Bad and the Ugly, and the Matrix? The rivers of blood and remarkable fight scenes aren't the reasons, as cool as they are. No, it's the film's chameleon-like blend of genres; Tarantino takes pieces of Kung-Fu, Anime, the Spaghetti Westerns, and Pulp Fiction, adds a dash of 70's funk, and molds together a colorful and explosive patchwork. Though each borrowed style already exists, their mere combination represents the movie's originality. So as thievish as Tarantino's tactics may seem, the recipe tastes too good for anyone to care.<br />This in mind, grab your kitana, hop on your motorcycle, and speed to the nearest mega-plex. Kill Bill is superbly entertaining and worth seeing twice, three times even.
B000002HJR|4.0|I know this review is coming a bit late, but hey, you don't have to read it if you don't like it.<br />Down are a lot like Pantera, with most of the Thrash element replaced by stoner metal. The guitars are heavier, the bass is louder and most of the vocals are slowed down. The production isn't great, unfortunately (the vocals are kinda drowned out a lot and the   guitars aren't as clear as you might want). All this can be fixed to your liking on your computer or your stereo, if it has good customisability options, but if you listen to it on a portable cd player, the mix is a bit sludgy. The SONGS are still great, though, and they aren't really meant to have the sharpest sound (this isn't radiohead). All the songs are fantastic, whether you're stoned or not. My personal favourites (as if you care) are Temptaion's Wings, Rehab, Pillars of Eternity, Hail the Leaf and Bury Me in Smoke.<br />Anybody who like slow, heavy guitars should definitely check out this album. 'DownII' is another great album, but i felt the guitars on here were much better. <br />And since we all know about the other bands, i might as well mention them: COC, and Crowbar fans will almost definitely like these guys as well. Most Pantera fans i know like them too. Eyehategod and Superjoint Ritual fans might think this album is a bit too slow, though.
0783233477|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I watched it when it first came out and I watched it again yesterday with my brother and sister (it was their first time).  My brother asked a question that I had always wondered:  why didn't this movie receive the acclamation it deserved?   Yes, it's pretty hard to convince people that death has feelings and falls in love, but it was presented to us in the best way possible.  Brad Pitt's performance was great, Hopkins' was phenominal.  The emotional story about love and life was strong enough to move.  It should of won an award. In my eyes it was a masterpiece.
B0000B3FCX|2.0|What can be said to all the VH1 drones and the Clear-Channel zombies that swear by this music to get them to see the light??  Go back 20 years and ask your rockin' parents how \\"cool\\" Toto, Survivor, Asia, Night Ranger, and all the rest of those \\"artists\\" were.  You'll get the idea of how bands like Nickelback, Train, and Matchbox 20 will be regarded, if they even PLAY this stuff on the radio in 20 years!!<BR>TURN OFF THE VH1!  TURN OFF YOUR CLEAR-CHANNEL WORLD DOMINATION RADIO!  Take your pimply butts down to the local indie music shop (or order it here) and pick up Muse, Supergrass, Mercury Rev, Flaming Lips, Turin Brakes, etc... 5 years from now when you're finally living and enjoying life, you won't have to deny that you were into these bands like you will for Nickelback!! HELL, listen to some Heavy Metal (UP THE IRONS!) if ya have to!!THE END IS COMING FOR THESE BANDS!!  And if ya don't believe me, tell me where Vertical Horizon, Lifehouse, Third Eye Blind, and Nine Days is these days...<BR>AND, to all the soccer moms and unnamed \\"music fans\\" who have and will complain about this review, TAKE A PILL!  This review wasn't meant for you, anyway.  You're obviously already sucked into the Clear Channel, \\"corporate-rock\\" brigade to DESERVE to listen to Supergrass; stick to your Toad The Wet Sprocket and Barenaked Ladies cd's instead.  I guess they need to eat too...
B000002KIE|5.0|There's only two more things to be said about this amazingly great album:<br />Buy NOW.<BR>Play LOUD.<br />You won't regret it!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|William Munny ( Clint Eastwood), is a former gunslinger who comes out of retirement for one last job. He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and a wanna-be gunslinger named &quot;The Schofield Kid&quot; (Jaimz Woolvett). The three set out to Big Whiskey, Wyoming where a group of prostitutes are seeking revenge for one of their own that gets raped, and cut up extremely bad. &quot;Little&quot; Bill Dagget ( Gene Hackman)is the sadistic and corrupt sheriff of Big Whiskey, and is desperate to keep bounty hunters from collecting on the money that the prostitutes are offering. English Bob(Richard Harris), is a legendary gunfighter who rides into town, and is also looking to collect on the reward. English Bob just happens to be an old rival of &quot;Little&quot; Bill's, and Bill is looking to make an example out of him. But the real focus of the film is on Will Munny, and the conflict that he must face within himself. As the story unfolds, Munny tries to convince himself that his return to the life is just temporary. But the consequences of his actions, could last him a lifetime... <br />&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the finest Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood succeeded on both sides of the camera with his role of William Munny, and his direction of the film. However, Eastwood is not the only reason for the film's success. The rest of the cast could not have done a better job. Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, and Richard Harris all give amazing performances. However the standout performance of the film goes to Gene Hackman as the sadistic sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot;. It is one of the best performances of his career. The musical score is haunting as well as beautiful, and it really drives the film. The cinematography is amazing as well. Everything about the film is perfect. The film was winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Clint Eastwood and Best Supporting Actor- Gene Hackman. <br />I was overjoyed when the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD was released. The extras are worth the price alone. Disc 1 features a beautiful transfer of the film, as well as commentary from Eastwood and his biographer Richard Schickel. Disc 2 brings 4 outstanding documentaries which includes interviews with the entire cast, the making of the film, and a lot more. There is also an episode of the TV show &quot;Maverick&quot; co-starring Clint Eastwood. The movie was already a must have on its own. But now with the 10th Anniversary Special Edition, there is no way that you can afford to pass it up!
B0000A36J5|5.0|You can't compare this to other cinema or to the books. TLOR films are there own entity, an interpretation visually of the Tolkien Novel (yeah, one novel, not three. The three book thing was just to off-set printing and binding cost)<br /><br />The continuation of the Fellowship begins within a day of the first film, the catapults into near hysterical abandonment. The film explodes so fast that's it's nearly dizzying. At the same time, when it stops, it feels stopped. When the endless shots of Merry & Pippin bouncing up and down on the Ent are finally over we have, well the movie pretty much ends 20 minutes later.<br /><br />The extended version seeks more balance of action and story. The most unfortunate parts of the film are three voice over montages with Elrod, Galadriel and Saruman telling us the story we are seeing. I hated the damn voice-overs, they where obviously just there explain to those who did not read the book what is going on. They are distracting and annoying and the hurt the film and insult the viewer. The entire sub-plot of Arwen facing life alone when Aragorn dies makes no sense. She gives up Immortality to marry him, she won't live forever when he dies -- Didn't Jackson read ALL the book? This wasn't just a change, I can accept change, I don't mind the Elves at Helms Deep or Farimer not being so wonderful as in the book, I don't care about that. But why add a long sub-plot into a long film that can't fit all the original story in?<br /><br />Making no comparisons to the books, it's near perfect, and longer is just better and more complex and interesting.
B00005RHGL|5.0|&quot;Tombstone&quot; takes place after Wyatt Earp ( Kurt Russell) retires from being a U.S. Marshall. He wants peace, quiet, and above all else : prosperity. That is until Wyatt is forced back into the life. The ruthless band of outlaws known as the Cowboys ( led by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn), gun for Wyatt, his family, and his best friend Doc Holliday ( Val Kilmer). Now Wyatt and Doc, along with Wyatt's brothers Morgan ( Bill Paxton)and Virgil (Sam Elliot)prepare for the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral. <br />Before I saw &quot;Tombstone&quot;, I was never really a huge fan of Westerns. However, &quot;Tombstone&quot; was so great that it managed to turn me into a huge fan of the western genre. The shoot out scenes and overall non stop action is amazing in this film. Tombstone also gives an extremely acurate portrayal of events as well. Kurt Russell gave the best performance possible as Wyatt Earp. He nailed the fierce determination and sense of justice. Val Kilmer gave the best performance in the film as Doc Holliday. Perfect portrayal of Holliday's lifestyle consisting of: drinking, smoking, gambling, women, and a quick trigger finger. Bill Paxton and Sam Elliot make nice additions as the Earp brothers. Dana Delaney gave a nice supporting role as the actress Josephine Marcus. Unbelieveable chemistry between her and Kurt Russell!! Other well known actors include Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Jason Priestley, Stephen Lang, and Thomas Hayden Church. Billy Bob Thorton makes a hilarious cameo in the film as well. <br />When Tombstone first came out on DVD, I unfortunately ended up buying it. The movie was great, but the DVD was just plain awful. However, I was overjoyed when Tombstone became a member of the Vista Series. This automatically puts the film on a whole new level. Vista Series DVD's always provide for the best quality possible, and tons of outstanding extras. You get a making of featurette in three parts, commentary from director George P Cosmatos, and more. I have seen many Westerns since &quot;Tombstone&quot;, but it is still the greatest Western ever made in my opinion.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a man with secrets.  Dealing with extreme repressed memories as the result of a tragedy that resulted in the death of his mother and the arrest of his father, Banner has become so withdrawn that it causes his break-up with fellow scientist Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly).  During the course of researching cell-regeneration, Banner must save a fellow worker from a potentially lethal overdose of gamma radiation.  Now, whenever he's angry, Banner morphs in the raging green powerhouse known only as the Hulk.  <br />After the great success of X-MEN, DAREDEVIL and SPIDER-MAN, it was inevitable that Marvel's Jekyll &amp; Hyde character, the Hulk would get his shot at cinematic glory.  After all, in the 40 years since he first popped out of the comic pages, this rampaging monster had thrilled many a reader as well inspiring a classic TV series.  When director Ang Lee (CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) was tapped for the project, the expectations were very high indeed.  While the final result is definitely impressive, it is not completely successful.  <br />Part of this stems from the fact that Lee plays the story completely straight, with hardly any traces of the humor that marks previous Marvel adaptations.  While it makes sense with his overall vision, it makes the first 40 minutes of the film a bit of a drag.  Indeed things finally start to pick up when Banner finally makes his big change to the Hulk at that point.  As repressed Banner, Bana definitely nails the character.  However, the character's very nature makes it very hard to sympathize with him.  In contrast, Jennifer Connelly fares better as his concerned girlfriend.  Surprisingly, the most effective performance comes from Sam Elliott's portrayal as General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross.  While he comes across as a typical hard-nosed soldier, one can sense the conflicted depths of the man.  The CGI created Hulk is also effective in providing the emotion that Bana seemingly lacks.  Nick Nolte turns in a rather bizarre performance as Banner's long-lost father that strangely fits into Lee's directorial vision.<br />Like the other Marvel movies, the action scenes in this flick are top notch.  You only wish there were more of them and less angst in the picture.<br />Overall, HULK is definitely a noble effort by Ang Lee to produce a serious look at the super-hero genre. It might not please everyone, but it is a unique entry in the super-hero film field.  As a result, it is definitely worth your time and my recommendation.
0446530891|2.0|Most of the reviews I've read here by other customers seem like they only read the first half of the book. I'm a big Baldacci fan, a big mystery/suspense fan and I really enjoyed the first half of this book...maybe even the first three quarters of it. But the ending and plot unveiling is just so ludicrous, so insipid and so filled with &quot;who gives a damn&quot; moments that this book went from a 5 to a 2 in about 20 pages. Very disappointing.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I've been waiting for him to upgrade his &quot;16 Golden Greats&quot; disc for a long time. This has almost everything from that, plus tracks from his last couple albums. Besides the classics &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;, &quot;Shock The Monkey&quot;, and &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;, this includes my favorite &quot;Digging In The Dirt&quot; from the &quot;Us&quot; album, and &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; with &quot;Kate Bush&quot;. Also here is &quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;More Than This&quot;, and &quot;Lovetown&quot; from the &quot;Philidelphia&quot; soundtrack. But the big plus for many is the inclusion of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, which was  not on the last collection. The only song that I really miss is &quot;I Have The Touch&quot;. Why it's not here I don't know. Otherwise, this should please old fans and new fans &quot;Big Time&quot;.
0393057658|5.0|If you are a fan of the statistics of the game, then this is for you.  See how Billy Beane and cast completely redevelop how players are scouted and drafted.  Without a big payroll, the A's are always contenders. How does he do it ?
B00006BTCA|2.0|A friend gave me this album because he said it was the sort of thing I listen to, which offended me after I heard how lame most of the lyricism and singing was. This reads like a teenage angst journal that should have stayed under the bed. Band: get a new singer.
0790736039|5.0|Stephen King's mini-series &quot;It&quot; is truly the only movie that still scares the living daylights out of me with the chilling performance of Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown. I remember first watching this when I was a sophomore in high school and getting scared senselessly with the demented imagination of Stephen King.  The mini-series (as condensed) as it had to be, pretty much stays faithful to the book. This is one of the few cases where I find myself enjoying the movie more than the book. After I saw &quot;It&quot;, I never saw clowns in the same light again. In fact, I now have a slight aversion to clowns, even Ronald McDonald with that bright orange-reddish hair. All I can see is Pennywise growling &quot;they all float down here&quot;. Obviously the standout performance in the movie has to go to Tim Curry with his spinetingling performance as the clown from hell Pennywise who really is this spider-like beast who feeds on children every 20-25 years. Annette O'Toole, the late and great John Ritter, Richard Thomas, Olivia Hussey (anyone who has seen &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; from the '50s/'60s will recognize an all grown up Olivia Hussey), Tim Reid, Harry Anderson, Jonathan Brandis, Seth Green, and the rest of the cast all give excellent performances in the movie. Some of my favorite moments in the film was when Pennywise was terrorizing the characters as children as well as adults. I loved it when Pennywise shows up in a black and white photo album. And then there was the time, the picture of Billy's deceased little brother started to ooze blood.  I still can't believe that &quot;It&quot; is the result of dreams/nightmares Stephen King had over a period of nine years. Simply incredible. No matter how many times I watch this two part mini series, I still get creeped out by Pennywise. Thanks to Tim Curry and Stephen King, I will never see clowns in the same light again. Truly a disturbing movie.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|When I first saw Reloaded, I thought it was a great movie. After I watched it on DVD and went through all the extras on disc 2, I thought it was an awesome movie. I then proceeded to watch Animatrix and played the game at a freind's house. The plot which everyone refers to as &quot;lacking&quot; in Reloaded is actually carried through these 2 other formats. If you want the full effect of the story, you need to get yourself immersed in it by getting into all 3 mediums, the movies, the game, and the anime. Then and only then will you really get it, even if you thought you already did.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|i must admit, the first time i listened to &quot;room on fire&quot;, i was less than in love with it, which was hard for me considering i am in love with the strokes. but the first time i listened to &quot;room on fire&quot;, i wasn't really listening.  the more i heard the eleven songs on the strokes' new album, the more i couldn't get them out of my head and constantly popping the cd into my car and discman.  sure, i can see why people are saying that there is no real advancement and that many of the songs could easily be slipped into &quot;is this it&quot;, but a closer listen will make you realize that there had been a layer of complexity added to their classic sound.  the strokes have managed to keep the sound that made them instantly untouchably cool but add more complex guitar rythyms, a synthesizer, and a variation of content that makes &quot;room on fire&quot; better than &quot;is this it&quot;.  listen to &quot;reptilia&quot; with julian casablanca's screaming over hammond's criminal guitar and you'll get it.  but then jump over to &quot;the end has no end&quot; and you'll see the growth of the band as a whole.  There are some skippable tracks that have too much &quot;is this it&quot; in them (&quot;meet me in the bathroom&quot; and &quot;between love and hate&quot; come to mind), but they are still of good quality.  On the whole, &quot;room on fire&quot; takes off where &quot;is this it&quot; took the strokes but adds some fun and newness to a sound has the same core of rock that initiated the strokes' success.
B00004T9UF|1.0|What the Hell is this? A white guy that is rapping and wanting to be black, what a race traitor. Eminem needs to be shot. I used to hear some of these songs when they played them at games in high school, This music is absolutly crap, all rap is crap for that matter. Eminem is such a loser, he has no talent, rap takes no talent, all it is is a beat machine and a turntable and some stupid uneducated person attemting to &quot;sing&quot;. Give me a break. I'd rather die than listen to this garbage. Do your self a favor and flush your money down the toilet, that is better than wasting it on this piece of trash. Rap Sucks!
0393314804|5.0|Top quality stuff.  Not for anyone who can't cope with 'vulgar' words, graphically detailed (not-very-nice) scenes or with phoenetic spelling, which I have to admit took a bit of getting used to, but provided you can get past all of those, it's the best book you'll ever read (probably).<BR>The storyline, as mentioned before, is almost impossible to understand until you're near the end, when everything makes sense, which ultimately makes the book soooo good, as it seems completely random.  Living in Edinburgh for a few years helped quite a bit with knowing the geography of the place - getting an A-Z or generally living there makes it more enjoyable.  It's worth remembering a couple of things, though:<BR>1) Edinburgh (or anywhere else in the UK) is not filled with junkies - they do exist, but that's no reason to think that it's everywhere.  Besides, the book is set in the early 80s/late 90s: Leith's changed a lot (the MTV music awards will be held there this week!)<BR>2) You CAN go for a drink in Edinburgh without getting stabbed.  Honest.  In fact, I think I'll do just that the night ...<br />Well worth it, though.  'Dugs' is like THE best chapter ever IMHO.  Very funny.
B0000009S3|4.0|In my opinion, this is the perfect album for both casual fans of the immortal Frank Zappa and neophytes looking to study the huge body of work left by this eccentric statesman of experimental rock. Hot Rats features very little of Frank's trademark scatological humor like his Mothers material, or weird avant-rock noodlings like Lumpy Gravy or Uncle Meat.<br />What it DOES feature, however, is brilliantly executed and composed jazz/rock jams that have aged very well. All but the first 2 minutes of Willie The Pimp do not have vocals. Willie The Pimp features a wild and raunchy guest vocal by weirdout master Don Van Vilet (a.k.a. Captain Beefheart) which fits the sleazy, rocking groove of the track nicely. Guitarist Zappa, the multitalented Ian Underwood (he plays piano, organ, flute, and all reed instruments!), and a team of session musicians fill your ears for the rest of this fine album.<br />Oh, and did I mention that Frank is a guitar guru on the order of Jimi Hendrix? You'll find plenty of flavorful and exciting, yet tastefully appropriate guitarwork throughout the album. Aspiring guitarists will want this album just for the hot licks on Willie The Pimp alone, my favorite on the album. Peaches En Regalia is a wonderfully catchy little number, one of Zappa's universally liked compositions. Son Of Mr. Green Genes is brilliant jazz-rock, my pick for second favorite. Also, the remastered CD version of this album gives us all 17 minutes of The Gumbo Variations jam. Little Umbrellas and It Must Be A Camel are quirky yet entertaining tracks that round out the album nicely.<br />The two things keeping Hot Rats from earning a five in my book are that there is a little too much noodling on The Gumbo Variations (if a minute or two was cut that would raise it to classic status) and that this is not the FULL Zappa experience, merely a bundle of wonderfully executed and accessible instrumentals that overlook Frank's funny and weird side. This is no loss for casual fans however, especially if you found the weird humor offputting or annoying. Hot Rats gets my recommendation, and I suggest that this is where you start your explorations of Zappa. Then pick up One Size Fits All, or his earlier Mothers recordings to get an idea of what Zappa was about.ver, especially if you found the weird humor offputting or annoying.

078322933X|3.0|I saw this in high school.  I am a big Reese Witherspoon fan and she's a wonderful, versatile actress. Mark Wahlberg is a talented actor as well but the older Fear gets the more forgotten it becomes.<br />Fear is one of those movies that I loved back then but don't care for now. I was young so I didn't know how bland and cliched' the plot was. This was a typical fatal attraction film with no new sparks. The only difference was it was for a younger audience. <br />Reese plays Nicole a sheltered teen with a father and stepmother. She has a trashy friend played by Alyssa Milano <BR>( who was not needed at all). Nicole hooks up with David ( Wahlberg ) not knowing that he's a lunatic who's lied about his past. He's developed a kind persona to woo her but it's all an act.  Nicole's father is the only one who can see through his act. So we go through the same lame plot of teen girl fighting her father to be with the boy she loves. The film went from decent to silly in less than an hour. David starts knocking people off and Fear turns into some cheap thrills movie. He rapes Alyssa's character ( off screen ) for whatever reason then spends the rest of the movie stalking Witherspoon. I had a young mind then so I thought this film was good in 1996.  Well it could have been a lot better. I am not saying don't watch this film because it's good to watch. Just don't expect more than the average teen thriller. The only difference in this and films like Joy Ride and The In Crowd is that the people in Fear can act.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah's back with 10 brand spankin' new tracks, and I can honestly say every one of these tracks is as good as anything she's ever released. It reminds me a lot of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, which is in my opinion, is Sarah's best album.<br />World on Fire, Stupid, Fallen and Perfect Girl are the strongest tracks on the album, each sending a haunting message like any other Sarah song.  If you liked FTE or surfacing, you won't be disappointed with this one.<br />ciao~!
0316236551|5.0|If your child likes to draw, you can't beat Ed Emberley for his fun, creative, and best of all EASY drawing instructions.  He provides simple, step-by-step pictorial guidelines which even young children can  follow:  if they can recognize and reproduce basic shapes, then they can draw the faces in this book.  For each step of a particular drawing, there is a basic instruction such as \\"make a green triangle\\" or \\"add two squiggly lines.\\" These instructions are accompanied by two sketches:  a drawing of whatever it is to be added and a drawing of the face-in-progress as a whole, so children can easily see how the parts fit together. Not only does this book provide a fun play activity, but also it's great for helping school-aged kids to enhance book reports and other school projects. Even adults will appreciate both the ease at which this book helps them to produce a wide variety of silly faces and the author's humorous style.  A great gift for pre-school and elementary school aged children.
B0000CD5FN|4.0|Unlike Johnny Cash, Joe Strummer's passing did not garner a cover shot on Rolling Stone or a stream of rereleases of old past recordings.  His death was largely ignored by mainstream media, much as his talent was in life.  A frustrating fact for a fan like myself, yet perhaps a blessing in disguise.  Reason:  his final, posthumous release &quot;Streetcore&quot; could be released 10 months after his death a slip under the radar, appearing in stores almost as a secret gift to Strummer fans.  A gift that, ironically, screams for attention with its flourescent orange packaging.<br />As for the music, &quot;streetcore&quot; is by far Strummer's best solo record.  It is raw in parts, and some songs feel a bit unrefined ( example:  the infectious &quot;all in a day&quot; whose repititive chorus never seems to end), but the rawness doesn't hinder the record, in fact it helps Joe stay true to his roots which come from not only punk rock, but folk music.  The acoustic, coffeshop open-mic feel of Bob Marley's &quot;redemption song&quot; sounds as if it was recorded in one, flawed, but honest take.  And the closing track &quot;silver and gold&quot; smells of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, a couple of Strummer's heroes, and is a fitting end to a brilliant career and life.<br />But the record isn't merely an ode to folk music, oh no.  There are some songs that play like outtakes of old Clash recordings, most memorably &quot;coma girl,&quot; &quot;burnin' streets&quot; and &quot;get down moses.&quot; Three songs that, with there fusion of punk and reggae would have easily fit on &quot;Sandinista&quot; or &quot;London Calling.&quot;<br />I'll take great record over a cover story in Rolling Stone anyday.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|After watching this movie, my first reaction was, &quot;That's it!?!&quot;  I believe that it was the reaction the wachowski brothers were going for.  The plot gets deeper and, though it may go over some viewer's heads, proves very compelling.  I won't give anything away, but it shakes the foundation of what you thought in the first installment.  It took several viewings to completely catch the meaning of the architect's loquacious rant, but it's very interesting once you get it all.  I loved this movie.  The only complaint I have is that, during 'the burly brawl', Neo is at times obviously cgi.  It is an easily overlooked fact, however, considering the pace of action.
B00005JMFR|3.0|I saw \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" Saturday (11/1) at the Imax Theater in Chicago.  No spoilers will be found here.  The negative:  wooden characters, some plot holes, very confusing overall (you'll want to see it again to understand), and the first 40 minutes is very slow-moving and talky.  Advice:  MAKE SURE you watch Matrix II right before seeing this one or you will be confused from the start.  The positive:  The last half is edge-of-your-seat, astounding entertainment.  The action and effects are amazing and everything is resolved.  I think most will leave the theater satisfied, though maybe a bit confused.
6302150930|4.0|This film was an extraordinary adaptation of Tess of the D'Urbervilles onto film.  Roman Polanski took great pains, I'm sure, in keeping the integrity of Hardy's novel when writing/directing the screenplay.  The thing that fascinated me most was the fact that the film was completely true to the book.  Not a single detail was altered in the screenplay.  I truly admire Polanski's ambition in keeping the movie so similar to the book.  But, I feel that the movie itself is a bit cumbersome.  The movie is 190 minutes in length!  I appreciate the fact that Hardy's ideas weren't tampered with, but as a viewer, it is difficult to watch the entire film.  I was forced to watch the film in increments because of its sheer length, but I would suggest watching the film in one sitting, so that the momentum of plot isn't lost.<BR>Nastassja Kinski was an incredible asset to the film.  Her acting was superb.  Her appearance is so intense and her voice is clear; she is very easy to focus on.  When I read the novel, I felt differently about Tess than when I watched Kinski play Tess.  My original impression of Tess after reading the novel was that she was meek and submissive.  I felt her family, Alec, and Angel easily controlled her.  Kinski brought to the role an element of independence and determination that I didn't pick up on in the novel.  Kinski portrayed the character Tess with such conviction and artistry.  She had a fiery spirit and made Tess seem much more capable than the Tess I had picked up on in the novel.  Kinski's Tess was very abrupt with Alec when he came onto her.  She was also short with Angel when he came back from Brazil and wanted to be her husband again.  Although the content of the plot is the same in the book, I felt that Kinski really made Tess's spirit come alive.<BR>I would recommend this film to anyone who has read Tess of the D'Urbervilles.  It is obvious that Polanski has great respect for Hardy because he kept the film true to the novel.  For this reason,I think the film adaptation is superb and is worthy of viewing.
B000089RVR|2.0|There are some really beautiful vocals on this CD but there are also some really dull vocals and the entire feel of the track just loses it for me.  I liked the White Flag vocals but found the hook a little wimpy conceptually.  It was an overplayed concept.  The songs do not stay in my head or inspire me after the CD is done and I do not have the urge to put it back on again.
B000002AS3|5.0|This is a great CD from start to finish.  Too many albums in the 1990's featured one or two good songs, then a lot of garbage.  Oasis' first album is a great opening to a promising future.  This CD has popular songs like Rock and Roll Star, Live Forever, Shakermaker, and Cigarettes and Alcohol, but songs Slide Away and Columbia might be the two best songs on this album.  If you are collecting albums from the early 1990's, this is definately one to have.
B00005R23S|3.0|I saw Bruce at Madison Square Garden the week this DVD was filmed, and its sad to say this DVD doesn't come close to the live show.  The biggest shortcoming is that they did not film one concert, or even several songs all the way through.  They show 'Born to Run' and then fade to black and then fade to another song, which was clearly not the next song played during the actually concert.  This really takes away from the feeling that you are there watching him.  The quality of music is amazing, and Bruce live is simply the best.  Unfortunately this DVD does not capture that.  I hope he releases a most continuous show from his 2003 'The Rising' tour, where he was twice as good as he was on this 2001 tour.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|What's great about the Strokes is that they don't try to be something they're not.  They are 5 guys in their early 20's, living in New York City, who have gone from obscurity to stardom in the last 2 years.  Their first album was called the album that saved rock n roll by virtually every critic who listened to it, their names and faces have become synonomous with \\"cool\\"... under all that pressure it's amazing their sophomore effort sounds as good as it does!<br />\\"Room on Fire\\" is a long night out on the town, without sleep, stumbling from bar to bar- greasy hair, smokey clothes, and goose bumps on your sweat drenched skin.  It is in the same family as \\" Is This It?\\" in terms of its sound, but does that have to be a bad thing?! Songs like \\"Automatic Stop,\\" \\"The End has no End,\\" and \\"Under Control\\" are every bit as good as \\"Last Nite\\" or \\"Hard to Explain.\\"  <br />This is a band that has never hid the fact that they are big fans of music, ALL music.  They've listed Cyndi Lauper and Tom Petty as influences, for Chrissakes!  Their eclectic tastes show in songs like the first single \\"12:51\\"- a song that sounds so  much like the Sonic Youth song \\"Drunken Butterfly\\" I keep waiting to hear Kim Gordon's voice appear.  And the 80's sounding \\"Between Love and Hate,\\" with it's playful guitars and bouncy drum beat, could have easily fit on the Top 40 charts in 1987. You can tell that these guys go to a lot of shows and aren't above cheering their competition on.<br />Too much emphasis has been placed on the fact that there isn't a large growth between the first album and the second.  The great thing about music is that you don't have to choose just one.  <BR>\\"Is This It?\\" is the record you listen to on your way TO a concert, \\"Room on Fire\\" is what you listen to on your way HOME at 3am.
0446530891|5.0|I loved this action-packed page-turner!  Don't believe the bogus slams of this talented writer's jealous rivals...SPLIT SECOND is one terrific story!  Once I started the story I couldn't pull myself away from it until after I had finished the whole book!  I know you will be blown away with this story too!
0345413377|2.0|Much as I enjoyed the first 2 of His dark material, I found the third one overly long, overly complex with parts too similar, in my view, to \\"Out of the silent planet\\". I totally lost interest in Mary Malone's doings and there were just too many parallel stories and plots, I became impatient with it all. Lyra's motivation to find Roger simply doesn't stand up in the face of what she has to go through (because she DREAMED about him?) and it becomes implausible and unbelievable. Overall disappointing and too ambitious.<BR>I'm surprised at the outcry by the Christian readers though. What about freedom of speech?? Isn't someone ALLOWED to write against Christianity? You don't have to agree but please let writers write what they will. I don't believe Pullman's books will corrupt anybody!
B000092T6M|2.0|I recently saw this on DVD for the first time since in the theatre in '91. I thought it was mostly OK then, and that the brouhaha about Costner's accent was dumb -- it's not that important (the rest of the cast has varying degrees of English, fake English and American accents).<br />However, seeing again confirms that it hasn't aged very well. It's a pretty lame effort by the standards of other action/adventure type films based on classics (Three Musketeers '73 or '93, Conan the Barbarian, Scarlett Pimpernel, Count of Monte Crisco etc.). Kevin Costner is a capable enough actor in contemporary roles but he's really weak at this kind of period part. It's not his accent, it's that he behaves in too modern a way. The script, which is not respectful of either the 12th century OR the classic story, adds insult to injury.<br />The character of Azeem seems to have been added purely for urban audiences -- he's woefully out of place and time and has no real function in the Robin Hood tale. Morgan Freeman is a fine actor and one can easily imagine a good original film built around the appealing character of Azeem, but it was very poor writing to put him in this movie. It muddles things more than they already are.<br />A lot of people seem to like Alan Rickman's performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham, but to me this was classic overacting and scene chewing. Mr. Rickman is capable of vastly better work than this, so I guess I have to blame the script and director for making the &quot;bad guy&quot; so cartoony. If there is no good villain, a story with a hero becomes unbalanced -- how can you fight evil, when evil is jokey and non-threatening? Michael Wincott does better as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, treating the part more seriously and with real menace, but he exists in the plotline here only to be repeatedly humiliated by Robin Hood and is killed off so early his character never is full developed.<br />Mary Ellen Mastrantonio wasn't a very good choice for Maid Marian -- beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course, but I found her gaunt and plain looking, and she had no chemistry with Kevin Costner at all. (Neither was the concept of her as a plucky swordswoman developed.) She actually seems to have more chemistry with Rickman, (even if it is the &quot;I hate you&quot; kind) so you don't have any kind of romantic flow at the end when Robin Hood and Maid Marian finally marry.<br />Costumes and sets seem both drab and inaccurate, a remarkable (under) achievement. Since Robin Hood is more a myth and fantasy/parable, rather than a history lesson, I think it would have been more enjoyable if the costumes were colorful and romantic, rather than drab and ragged. At any rate, it's not a movie that one gets a lot of visceral enjoyment just from watching the sets and costumes.<br />Since almost 15 years have gone by, I think someone could seriously think about remaking another version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with better actors, script, etc. There have been lots of versions over the years -- good, bad and indifferent -- but this is DEFINITELY not the definitive version.

B0000DJZA0|4.0|i love the spacey style of emotional rock that coldplay delivers time and time again. It's hard in this day and age to buy albums from new artists because you hate wasting 15 bucks on a one hit wonder. I was afraid of coldplay after yellow but extremely surprised they have lasted this long and keep outdoing the next album. I rate this album really a 5 for what it has and the amazing sound quality of the album. but it loses a star for songs missing. Examples include the sublime &quot;the scientist&quot; and the major album hit from their first album &quot;Trouble&quot;. coldplay live 2003 makes you feel like you are front row, or if not, at least the 5th row from the stage. fave's are shiver, yellow, clocks, in my place. if the live cd had the same tracklisting as the dvd.. i'd give it ten stars.
B000002I27|5.0|\\"Strange Days\\" is The Doors' sophomore gem, and my favorite Doors album of them all. While their self-titled debut was a landmark groundbreaker, I beleive \\"Strange Days\\" is better. Darker than their debut, \\"Strange Days\\" takes you into the deep, mysterious, disturbing, haunting, and somewhat spookieness of music. That's what's so appealing about this album. It sticks in your mind.     My favorite song from the album is the title track \\"Strange Days;\\" very dark, psychedelic keyboards from Ray Manzarek that almost explodes in your ears, and a haunting echo effect in Morrison's lyrics. I just love that knock-down-drag-out drum of John Densmore, and Robby Krieger's guitar work as well; hard-edged, but melodic and infectious.     I also dig \\"Moonlight Drive.\\" \\"Moonlight Drive\\" has a unique \\"marching\\" Densmore drum shuffle, and a sweet little Manzarek piano-keyboard goove. One of the unique things about guitarist Robby Krieger is that he uses the neck of a bottle to play the guitar and that \\"bottle neck\\" guitaring really shows up well on this album. He can sure make the guitar sound extremely unique and uncanny, and I love how it sounds on \\"Moonlight Drive;\\" kind of a wavy, dipping up-and-down kind of sound. Indeed, it would be a great song to drive in the moonlight with!     \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\" is one of my favorites from the album. It's another neat little shuffle with a free-flowing Manzarek keyboard and Robbie Krieger guitar that takes you to a place where you feel you don't have a care in the world. The softer part of the song is followed by a climax of Jim Morrison's trademark energetic voice, and the rush of rambunctious music around him.     Then there's the two \\"Girl\\" songs that are superb!! \\"Unhappy Girl\\" and \\"You're Lost Little Girl.\\" In \\"You're Lost Little Girl,\\" Morrison delivers a dark, soft, beckoning voice and Kreiger's guitar work is softer and emotion-filled in a catchy Doors-like way; kind of free-flowing and laid-back. And check out Kreiger's guitaring amongst the Manzarek's melodic keyboards and soft, shuffling Densmore drum beat on \\"Unhappy Girl\\"; unique like no other. Again, Robby shows that unique \\"bottle neck\\" guitaring. Manzarek and Krieger are superb; it is just another song that shows how well they work together. The song is pure psychedelia and very trippy.    \\"People Are Strange\\" was a song I first heard on the movie, \\"Forrest Gump\\" and it is one of The Doors' classic hits. Great guitar work, keyboards, and vocal performance. I like how the music stops and starts, as it adds to the atmophere that the group is trying to put forth to us in this song. The quirkiness of this song fits the title well. This song really tells a story about those who are a little different in society. Sadly, many are rejected, forgotten, ignored and judged.     The Doors' other hit from this album is \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" a bluesy, fun rock song with a contagious Densmore drum beat and goovey guitar from Krieger. The keyboards by Manzarek really smoke here. I like how Jim builds up his voice with the keyboards and guitars as the song gets nearer to the end.    \\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\\" is very mysterious, with spacey keyboard chords, strange guitar hooks, and a slow drum shuffle. It really gives you a mind journey. It's a very slow, psychedelic, haunt for your ears.     There is one song that is not really a song, but more like a poem by Morrison; \\"Horse Latitudes.\\" I can honestly say I'm not sure what this is all about, but it's kind of interesting. A bit disturbing though. You can hear the wails of people in the background as if they're in total despair. You hear the crack of a whip, and the shimmering sound of what sounds like piano strings. Jim's rough yell, echos through your ears.    The album finishes with \\"When The Music's Over;\\" another progressive song similar to \\"The End\\" on their debut album, only not quite as low and draggy, but it does drag on more than my liking. The song does seem to have more direction changes, and is a bit more hard, upbeat, and rocking, than \\"The End.\\" I do like the phrase \\"When the music is your special friend.\\" I know many can relate to that including myself.    If you are in the mood for a very interesting, dark, and insightful trip through music, and want to hear some of the best music The Doors made, please buy this album now!! What a ride!! I think that every song could have been a greatest hit. This is a must-have album for all fans of The Doors, 60's psychedelic rock, and classic rock in general. Highly recommended!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Really enjoyed this. Pixar has not missed with this one. Lovely animation, great writing. The kids will love it, as will adults. Ellen Degeneres is great and steals the show. I dive and do underwater photography so it was especially amusing to me. The behavioral habits of the fish were nicely written into the movie as well. Highly recommended for all animation and Disney fans, divers with a sense of humor and anyone who would like to enjoy good DVD.
B000002I25|4.0|This was the album that brought these psychedelic rock legends their first taste of fame. I was born long after The Doors were in their prime and the group will never age, but only get better with time. My junior high art teacher played The Doors records during our classes frequently, and that's when I got my first taste of this classic gem of a debut album. The Doors are deep and poetic at times; never ceasing to make you pause and think.    The hard-driving \\"Break On Through\\" with Jim Morrison's edgy, powerful voice is a great way to start the album off. Ray Manzarek's fuzz-sounding keyboard base and Robbie Krieger's guitar are guarenteed to make any music system smoke. Manzarek's furious melodic keyboards are a trademark of this song.     \\"Light My Fire,\\" is unbelievable!! Manzarek is a keyboard god and Krieger is a guitar machine; both are out of this world! The classic keyboard intro gets the whole party started, and the entire song is a keyboard and guitar soaked masterpiece of musical psychedelia with a touch of Jim Morrison's dark, haunting voice. John Densmore adds a bashing joy ride of drumming on this song.     \\"Back Door Man,\\" basically a song about getting laid by women; including those who already have men in their lives, features a hard-core, jagged-edged, demanding vocal performance by Jim, and catchy Manzarek keyboard work as usual. The song is almost a flipside of \\"Twentieth Century Fox.\\" The keybaord work on both are very similar. And who can forget the line: \\"You men eat your dinner; eat your pork and beans.....I eat more chicken than any man ever seen....I'm a back door man.......the men don't know but the little girls understand.\\"     Their cover of \\"Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)\\" is poppy, bluesy, and kind of bouncy; probably one of most unique songs on the album style-wise and keyboard-wise. And who can forget that quirky \\"chiming\\" instrument included (not sure what it is). What an atmosphere the song brings! I was around 13 or 14 when I first heard this song and I thought it was strange, but it's a fun song that I've come to love.     I first heard \\"Soul Kitchen\\" in the movie \\"Forrest Gump.\\" A bipolar piece that shuffles, it features soft, Manzarek keyboarding, and Jim's laid-back free-flowing lyrics, followed by a climax of stomping Densmore drums, loud Manzarek keyboard melodies, and Jim's hard, demanding voice.     The Doors give one for the ladies with \\"Twentieth Century Fox,\\" my favorite from the album; fun and peppy, with very infectious, psychedelic keyboard chords. Robby Krieger's guitar intro is quite catchy.      Jim sounds wonderful on \\"The Crystal Ship;\\" a soft, dark-tinged, melodic, journeying song into another world. Very trippy indeed. Jim's haunting opening line of \\"Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss\\" will stick in your head. Although this may sound like a song about drugs, it is supposed to be a song about The Doors starting their career as musicians; \\"The crystal ship is being filled....a thousand girls.....a thousand thrills....\\"     \\"End Of The Night\\" is one of those very eerie, dark, haunting, Doors songs that I cannot get enough of. In this song, you are \\"taking a journey to the bright midnight.\\" Jim's dark, brooding voice with those spooky keyboards are amazing!     \\"Take It As It Comes\\" is just a driving rock song; basically a flip-side of \\"Break On Through,\\" only not as unique. There's nothing particularly special about it other than it's a fun and rowdy classic rock cut. Robbie and John were both into meditation, and the title of this song is based on a favorite phrase that one of the instructors used.    \\"I Looked At You\\" is not popular with a lot of Doors fans, but it's one of my favorites. Upbeat and filled with melodic Manzarek keyboard chords and Krieger guitar chords, it's just a fun poppy rock song.     My least favorite song is the classic epic that virtually every Doors fan likes; \\"The End.\\" While quite a journey into a very dark, disturbing, but interesting story, it kind of drags a little too much for my liking. It is more like a huge Jim Morrison poem with the same slow music throughout much of the piece. Jim is a superb poet though, and the words \\"The killer awoke before dawn.....he put his boots on.....he took a face from the ancient gallery and he walked on down the hall\\" is forever getting stuck in my head. People can draw their own conclusions on what this song is about, as there have been many speculations. With The Doors, their songs mean something totally different than what is actually being sung at times. That's kind of how it is with \\"The End.\\"    If you're not a Doors fan but are curious about the band and would like to hear some good Doors music, pick this one up. Virtually every song is a classic. I really don't think this classic debut will collect too much dust on your shelf!! \\"The Doors\\" is highly recommended for anyone who loves psychedelic rock with a very intellectual, insightful touch. Pop the CD in your player, drift back to 1967, and join The Doors on the first step of their magnificant journey. This is where it all started for Morrison and Co. Buy and enjoy.
B00005JKC3|2.0|How many films of the 1990s and 00s can be reviewed in one sentence:  The special effects were dazzling, but the plot and acting left something to be desired?  If the 1970s were the height of the humanistic film (&quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?,&quot; &quot;Breaking Away,&quot; &quot;Testament,&quot; &quot;Harold and Maude,&quot; &quot;Ordinary People&quot;) than 1990-2003 has to be its all-time low.  So much current film is digital and excessively slick.<br />Director Ang(st) Lee's attempt to inject the issues of child abuse and family dysfunction into its FX parade meets with clumsy results.  &quot;Spiderman&quot; was far superior in fusing its dazzling visuals with the charisma of Kirsten Dunst and Tobey McGuire, but no actor in &quot;Hulk&quot; is terribly compelling in his or her role.  &quot;Hulk&quot; vacillates between slow, sad, and baffling passages about Bruce Banner's secrets and upbringing and roid-ragingly impressive but oddly disconnected Hulk transformation and battle sequences.  Eye-candy and ennui.  Pass on this.  Buy &quot;Spiderman&quot; instead.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Now I have to admit it: I WAS on of those people who bought \\"Laundry Service\\" then worked backwards. But it turned out that I really fell in love with \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\"Dnde Estn Los Ladrones?\\". So my opinion of \\"Laundry Service\\" is really coming from the background of those two previous albums.    Despite what some have said, I really do think that Shakira keeps the same type of metaphorical sarcasm and deep meanings that were present on \\"Pies\\" and \\"Ladrones,\\" just not to quite as high a degree. \\"Poem To A Horse\\" is a great example of that. Also, \\"Que Me Quedes T\\" is very eloquently worded and meaningful.    Again, like on her other albums, she has a wide range of musical styles to tickle your ears' tastebuds. \\"Objection (Tango)\\" is a mix of rock and tango (of course...), \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" has a tropical/world feel to it, \\"Ready For The Good Times\\" is remeniscent of a disco-type sound (maybe?) and \\"Poem To A Horse\\" has miniscule traces of light ska woven throughout it.    This is my only disappointment about the album (and it's a BIG ONE!): I'm very sad that Shakira decided to translate \\"Ojos As.\\" I think the Spanish version from \\"Dnde Estn Los Ladrones?\\" was fine alone and that the English version is...I cringe to say it...horrible. I would not in a million years call anything else of Shakira's 'horrible,' except perhaps her Portugese remixes of her first album...but that's another story. :)
B00005UKE0|5.0|In 1970, Harrison released his first and most brilliant solo album, All Things Must Pass.  If you buy anything by George Harrison, buy this!  Nearly every song is worth listening to, some of the best including &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;Isn't It A Pity,&quot; &quot;What Is Life,&quot; &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; and &quot;Hear Me Lord.&quot;  In the special remastered edition, a total of ten tracks -- 5 bonus tracks and 5 original jam tracks -- were added, making the collection even more worth it.<br />Even though George was &quot;the quiet one,&quot; his solo debut crushed the debuts of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and this album proves that leaving the Beatles made his amazing song-writing ability even stronger.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I used to own &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; but other than that I don't have anything to compare this album to. The combination of all the songs together kind of gave me the impression that this album has to do with:<br />&quot;the ups, downs, and inbetweens that love and lust can bring.&quot;<br />That's my very general synopsis of the album. As for the music...it's No Doubt! All the way! I would definitely reccomend this album. I'm too lazy to break down each song like I usually do, or even a song or two at least. Oh well. Some other album I'll do that. :)
B0000542D2|4.0|I know this sounds like a broken cyber-record but I'm going to have to agree with most people's complaints on this poorly packaged DVD of a great movie.  Yes, it's worth getting just to have A Hard Days' Night on DVD.  John has great wisecracks (&quot;She looks more like him than I do!&quot;), George smarts off to a shirt manufacturer (&quot;I wouldn't be seen dead in them!&quot;), Paul's wit is dry as he spends most of the movie charming the ladies when he's not looking after his eccentric grandfather (&quot;He's not your grandfather,&quot; remarks John of him.  Paul's reply: &quot;Everyone's entitled to 2!&quot;).  But Ringo steals the show, acting-wise.  Feeling neglected from the other 3, he goes off by himself and befriends a young boy who throws a spare tire at him.  I have to dock this 1 star because the documentary &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; is not included (which is now out of print.  I'd trade most of the extra's anyday for it!  Most of the interviews with the other actors and people behind the scenes are dull and unmemorable.  However, there is a nice interview with George Martin and a clever interview with the boy (now grown up) who pals around with Ringo, in addition to a nice tribute to the &quot;clean old grandfather,&quot; which explains how he got to be so &quot;clean&quot; for A Hard Day's Night.  I think it's great they were able to interview the woman who had a scene with Paul which got deleted but how is it that they were able to track her down and not get the rights to that scene?  Does it even exist anymore?  She seems to have a good memory of the scene.  Worst of all is a corny interview with the woman who puts her glasses on and says to John &quot;You don't look like 'im a'tall!&quot; (If you're curious to watch some of the extras, be sure to skip &quot;Give Us a Wink&quot;). Oh well, it's still a great movie.  Enjoy it and try not to let the disappointing packaging spoil the magic of the Fab Four.  Hopefully, sometime in the not-too-distant future, we'll get this without the surround sound performances and psuedo-widescreen and with more memorable extras.
B00007AJF9|2.0|A previous reviewer referred to this film as 'not quite historically accurate' which is putting it very midly indeed.  There is hardly anything in this very odd film that is historically accurate.  I don't wish to be ageist, but Richard Attenborough is about 40 years too old for the part of Lord Burghley, he was only about 35 when Elizabeth became Queen, and what's all this rot about her dismissing him from her service/  She never did, eh stayed with her until he died.  Equally absurd is the notion that she didn't know Leicester was married, of course she did, his marriage wasn't secret.  And they keep on having sex all over the place, as if there weren't spies everywhere at court watching like hawks for any signs of immorality (the Spanish Ambassador bribed her laundresses to report on the state of her sheets).  The Duke of Anjou is shown visiting her as an adult suitor (he was bout 7 at the time).  And as for the Duke of Norfolk, he looks like something out of Lord of the Rings, a friend of mine remarked that she kept expecting to see a lot of dwarfs dancing round him saying \\"shall we kill him now master\\" or something.  Everybody acts very well, but it's all such rubbish.  Why wasn't the real story of Elizabeth considered interesting enough to make a good film?  She didn't exdactly have a dull life, after all.
B000002HPT|4.0|I didnt even know that FIT was a DT album until recently, curious after hearing that the same person who designed such Pink Floyd Album Covers as A Momentary Lapse of Reason and the Division Bell had done the Cover for Dream Theater; I purchased the album.<br />The album begins with the rocktastic &quot;New Millenium&quot; too bad its 2003, the lyrics are outdated but the music still kicks ass so its alright.  Track 3 &quot;Peruvian Sky&quot; is seriously one of the most badass songs Dream Theater has concocted in their mysterious laboratory, LaBrie sings like no other and The musical interplay is so damn heavy and melodic, its amazing.  The next song for me is the lowest point on the album it embodies Dream Theater's single weakness, Lame Lyrics, the music is good and Petrucci plays a very DiMeola-esque guitar solo.  The albums epic is &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; is moves through many facets of music possibly the most versatile single song epic Dream Theater has created and there is a segment featuring the vocals of Doug Pinnick from King's X.  The final noteworthy song of the album is &quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; pulsating guitar and bass create a great rock song.<br />Although many Prog fans have yet to discover this hidden gem, FIT contains some of Dream Theater's classics.  James LaBrie is definately given the spotlight through most of the album and he excels unlike any other Dream Theater album.  Petrucci/Portnoy/Myung/Sherinian provide the album with an awesome musical ensemble that create an oceanic depth to DT's music that is unlike any other album due to their primary role as supporters to LaBrie on this album.  Also this album is probably their most &quot;radio-friendly&quot; but i dont mean that in a bad way at all.  Please check this album out after a listen or two you will be hooked.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I'll give this 7 stars for content and performance and 3 for sound quality, which averages out to 5.<br />People have always lumped Johnny into the &quot;country&quot; category, but that's extremely misleading.  Like other great artists, Johnny isn't so easily stereotyped and this live recording from San quentin in 1969 proves that this claim has been true for decades.  If one must pigeonhole this legend, then how about tossing him into the &quot;American Music&quot; bin?  It's true that Johnny was well versed in all forms of American music, from folk through blues, country, gospel and rock.  He even had an appreciation of jazz, but one can only find subtle hints in the music he played.  But rest assured - he went well beyond the confines of country.<br />Hot on the heels of his Live at Folsom Prison album in '68, San Quentin has quite a different song list and better performances.  I like the Folsom set, but Johnny was not in his best form for that date, suffering from a sore, dry throat.  The San Quentin show was even more confident and more aggressive.  The CD format, which allowed producers to include all of the original concert, is a blessing.<br />Fortunately, the explicative from &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot; was passed through this version unbleeped and although I don't need to hear SOB, it does fit the mood and makes the song flow better.  Not only that, but the attitude behind the cursing makes the whole set more real.  One can only imagine that the tension prior to and during these prison shows was different than the typical concert.  The band/crowd interaction certainly has a personality all its own.<br />Johnny was a very down-to-earth person and that fact was reflected in his music.  But he also was well traveled and was a very intellegent thinker.  It's easy to listen to his latest offerings and see him as the sage icon, but if one goes back and listens to his old recordings, like San quentin, you'll see that he was well down the path decades ago.
B000002KHF|5.0|Whether his music was recorded in the late 60s or early 70s, it is never dated.  Yet he always seemed ahead of his time.  The man is a vocal genius emanating sounds awarded to the most talented vocalists.  And there is only ONE way to listen to Morrison, and that is with quality equipment and loud!<br /><br /> I can't get over how much I LOVE  \\"And it Stoned Me\\" about a playful fishing trip romp with a friend, the voice, the lyrics, and the beat!<br /><br />Another favorite, \\"Moondance\\", a sultry jazzy number that many other performers have covered.  \\"Into the Mystic\\"  is a bluesy, jazzy ballad.<br /><br />But I can't reiterate enough, the BEST CD ever is  Morrison's '68 [[ASIN:B000002KAT Astral Weeks]];  It's uncomprehensive  that at the young age he was, this phenomenal masterpiece evolved, .....way back in the 60's ...unbelievable.  That one is my stranded-on-an-island cd. I recommend:  [[ASIN:630169368X Van Morrison, The Concert]]......Rizzo
B0000VD04M|5.0|I love this movie, and I plan to buy it on DVD (even though I own it on VHS).  This is the kind of movie that I like to see Tim Burton make: small budget, artsy, dark, hilarious.  Ed Wood is one of my favorite Johnny Depp characters, followed probably by his role as Hunter S. Thompson.  Bill Murray also has a very entertaining small role.  And, of course, who can forget Martin Landau's chilling performance as the opiate-addicted Bela Legosi, winning an Oscar in 1994 for Best Supporting Actor.<br />This is the movie that lead up to Burton's attempt at his own sci-fi 'B' movie \\"Mars Attacks\\", although I thought Mars was a bit of a letdown.<br />The humor is very dark and dry, but that's how I like it served.  Definitely not a movie for everyone.<br />Buy this movie!!!
6304806426|2.0|The DVD is a great disappointment because of the lack of any special features at all. The movie is great but this is a bare bones DVD with nothing extra. The director has actually done a audio commentary for this film that was available on laser disk. When are we going to see this on DVD? Come on Miramax this was a pretty lame effort; we would like a DVD with more features?  Why waste a directors commentary on an obsolete format?
B00001P4RI|5.0|I never understood how people could distinguish between Brendan and Lisa in Dead Can Dance, they were both so amazing and together they made amazing music (especially 'the host of seraphim' and 'the carnival is over') I haven't listened to Lisa's solo work as much, though I am shocked to hear that some believe her to be the creative force behind DCD, they both compliment one another.<br />Anyway, this record is in the great tradition of such DCD songs like &quot;american dreaming&quot; &quot;don't fade away&quot; and &quot;i can see now&quot;. My favorite is the cover &quot;I must have been blind&quot; which will make you fall apart. &quot;voyage of Bram&quot; &quot;saturday's child&quot; and &quot;archangel&quot; are major standouts as well. the whole record has a really somber, moody and warm melancholy/resigned sadness feel. After all these years of living and experience, this record seems to communicate the vision of life after many disappointments and joys. How do you describe being &quot;cut loose before one's time&quot;? How do you communicate those feelings of being helpless, but still having dignity? I think this record does that as well as can be done.<br />I'm sure Lisa Gerrard's solo projects are worth checking out, but I think Brendan's solo record is phenomenal.
B00008PW2D|2.0|I am a true fan of SATC and this being said I find it very difficult to want to purchase the 5th season at the price they are asking.  This is highly unreasonable.  There are only 8 episodes here people.  A simple $$$$ price would do.  If it does not go down to that I will NOT be purchasing the 5th season and that will be disappointing.
0156027321|5.0|I really, really enjoyed the experience of reading this book.<br />I read the first half of &quot;Pi&quot; while sitting in a bathtub, full of water, of course.  I read the second half laying on my bed with my 4 week old son sleeping on my chest bobbing from one side to the other.  Both of the external stimuli seemed to make reading this seem even more poignant for a lot of different reasons.<br />I hope that Hollywood preserves the brilliance of Martel's storytelling when adapting this book to the bigscreen next year.

B0000027D5|4.0|He was around when the album was recorded, of course, but I have never read any comments he made about this explosive album.   Santana pays homage to--or copies, depending on your want--some of the riffs from &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot; by Davis, playing them note for note with the rest of the band in two.  I suppose it's not ironic that Miles played some of the JJ stuff live in Japan for &quot;Agharta&quot; although oddly AFTER Santana recorded &quot;Lotus&quot; in the same country.
B00005JM02|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater with my 10 yr old daughter and my fiancee who is an avid diver. I sat between them and from one side I had a 10 yr olds reviews as she had already seen it before and on the other side my honey was giggling with delight and squirming in his chair from the animation and how realistic it all was.  He tugged and pulled at my arm in pure delight.  It was just wonderful!  This is a must see movie for the whole family and a definate buy for the collection!!

B00005JM02|2.0|I didn't see this movie in the theaters but made a mental note that I should buy the DVD later.  I figured I would like this one as much as Pixar's earlier efforts (Toy Story, Bug's Life, Monsters Inc).<br />Sadly, that was not to be the case.  Pixar's other films had a broad appeal to both children and adults, and the characters were believable.  Finding Nemo seems to be geared mainly towards children and is filled with characters with practically no personality, both in the animation and the voices.  The whole thing is far too cutesy-poo for my tastes, as well as being basically not funny.  Pixar thinks a fish whose memory and common sense come and go is funny, so this becomes the running joke throughout the whole movie.<br />There were some amusing parts, though, like the dentist's office scene, but I won't give them away here.  The animation was, of course, the best part of the whole movie.  Without a decent story or plot, so what?  Pixar is starting to crank them out so fast they're sacrificing quality for quantity.<br />The DVD itself is overcompressed, too.  They shoved alot of extras onto the main DVD instead of putting all of them on the 2nd DVD, so they sacrificed picture quality.  Thanks!
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I loved Surfacing, so I really looked forward to Sarah's new release, especially given the six years between Surfacing and Afterglow.  My first impression is that Afterglow is good, but forgettable.  Afterglow does not have the originality, hit songs, or great arranging found on Surfacing.  I'm dissapointed because I wanted to be blown away by a great recording, but Afterglow is no more than good.  My biggest complaint: The tracks lack diversity and creativity compared to what we know she can do.  Her lyric writing also is not as good in comparision to previous CDs.  I feel Afterglow lacks the creative spark that typifies her great songs of the past.

B0000AMRJB|4.0|I missed this intentionally when it came out in 1983 believing it to be another version of the Al Capone story.  It is, sort of.  Of course Al Pacino would be brilliant as Al Capone and demand every square inch of the screen and get it.  And he was and he did.  And director Brian DePalma would spray the screen in scarlet, and he did.  However this updated and revised version set in Miami from a script by Oliver Stone is very much worth watching even though it's almost three hours long.<br />First of all, Al Pacino is riveting as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee released from prison by Fidel Castro in 1980 who arrives in Florida with a yearning to rule the world and a huge chip on his shoulder.  His character is an extreme version of the &quot;live fast, die young&quot; species, the kind of guy who takes extreme chances and fears nothing.  It is a shame that it is not obvious that for every one of the Tony Montanas in the world who actually made it to the top of the cocaine pile, there are thousands who weren't able to dodge the bullets and died not just young, but very young.<br />Second, there is not a dead spot in the whole movie.  Stone's action-driven script and DePalma's focused direction compel our attention.  If you can stand the bestial mentality and the animalistic flash culture of the drug lords and their sleazy world, you might even want to see this twice.<br />What I found myself watching closely was Michelle Pfeiffer at twenty-something, strikingly beautiful and totally degenerate as the cocaine-addled moll.  Also very much worth watching was Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony Montana's sister Gina.  The big brother/little sister incestuous theme (from the original Scarface of 1931 starring Paul Muni and directed by Howard Hawks) was craftily prepared and reached a striking climax (if you will) in the scene in which Gina tells Montana that he must &quot;have her&quot; (that's not exactly the words she used) since he won't let anybody else have her.  The touch of necrophilia that followed was perhaps gratuitous.<br />What I loved was the way DePalma reminded us again and again of how trapped the characters were by their desperate indulgences, the expensive liquor, the cigars, the cocaine, the stacks of money that took hours to count by machine.  The scene in which Pfeiffer takes a snort of cocaine, a puff of a cigarette and a swallow of booze one after the other as the only thing she knows how to do in this world (with the white powder still on her nostrils) was wonderful in its piteous effect.  I also liked the scene in which Montana, seated in his black leather chair with his initials in gold lettering, surrounded by his security video screens, dives into a pile of cocaine and comes up with it on his nose.  Reminds me of the old doper saying, &quot;Too much is never enough.&quot;<br />The shoot 'em up finale of course was much, much overdone and about as realistic as a John Wayne barroom fight, but I loved the way Pacino played Montana near the end as a kind of paranoid Napoleon, the little guy who wanted to rule the world now finished and insane.  Note, by the way, in how many scenes Pacino played a very vigorous persona sitting down.<br />In the final analysis this is a morality tale, a kind of very flashy &quot;crime does not pay&quot; saga not because the cops will get you (they don't) but because the life itself will corrupt you beyond anything human.  Those who live by the gun will die by the gun, and there is no security among murders and thieves.ouch of necrophilia that followed was perhaps gratuitous.<br />What I loved was the way DePalma reminded us again and again of how trapped the characters were by their desperate indulgences, the expensive liquor, the cigars, the cocaine, the stacks of money that took hours to count by machine.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|After a long break, it was great to hear Sarah McLachlan's voice again.  Her music and lyrics have matured along with her life, as it has in all her albums.  The CD was well worth the wait, and a tour would also be greatly appreciated.

B00009TB5G|4.0|I think these so called Tolkien Purists need to wake up.  This movie was wonderful.  (The reason I didn't rate it five stars is the fact that I'm expecting the Return of the King to be any better.)<BR>But back to my original point.  I am a devoted reader of fantasy books, and have long loved Tolkiens trilogy.  Personally, I'm amazed at how closely these guys followed the books.  Oh no, you mean Aragorn didn't really jump off the wall!?!?  BIG STINKIN' deal.  That doesn't really impact the plot lines at all.  The reason they took Frodo to Gondor was probably to help the viewer get a sense of the desperate situation there without wasting time throwing in side stories.  You have to hand it to these men.  They have followed the plots and made better movies than I would have ever expected in a thousand life times.  Just look at Jurassic Park, or any movie based on a book.  In the Book \\"Jurassic Park\\" the Grandpa was greedy and even died (among tens of other plot changes).  These movies have helped the world visualize and appreciate Tolkiens world.  I don't think Tolkien could have asked for anything more.
B00005JMFR|3.0|The third and final installment of the Matrix trilogy is here, and the series doesn't end with the bang that most fans had been hoping for.  Granted, the effects are impressive.  The fight scenes, though far fewer in this film, are well done and loaded with adrenaline.  Neo's and Smith's evolving powers are used to their fullest in the final battle.  And the battle in Zion is equally impressive, with thousands of Zionites in battle robots fending off an attack by a horde of Sentinel robots.  Unfortunately, as impressive as these things are, they have all been seen before.  And therein lies the glaring fault with Revolutions - it's all been done before.  In the previous films, the storyline was as engrossing as the effects, and the result was a series that continually fresh and groundbreaking.  Revolutions serves up great effects, but lacks the storyline needed to make it a complete movie.  The few twists that do show up in the movie are mostly predictable, especially if you have been paying attention to the previews.<br />Despite the storyline problems, Revolutions is entertaining enough for a matinee ticket or a video rental.
B000002WPI|5.0|An amazing album. Every single member of the Clan adds a special element, and this is shown best on Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).<BR>    U-God's flow on &quot;The Art of Chessboxin&quot; is one of my favorite flows of all time : Raw I'ma give it ya/ Wit no trivia/ Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia/ My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation/ Like the Emancipation Proclamation.<BR>    It is the originality, however, that sets this debut album apart. A hip-hop group modeled after Kung-fu movies?<BR>    Yeh, and they're the best hip-hop group of all time.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I didn't think they would ever top OK Computer or Kid A, but they have; this is an incredible album. Just amazing. Best tracks are Backdrifts and Wolf At The Door. The Gloaming is brilliant too, despite a pretty goofy title. Anyone who tells you The Bends is better than this probably owns Coldplay CDs, so you'd best ignore their advice, correct?
B00000294R|5.0|Don't even debate it, no one comes close to Big L. He's the best to ever hold a mic, and as far as I'm concerned, the best to ever hold a mic. If you don't like this album, or can't at least appreciate L's amazing lyrical talent, then don't consider yourself a true hip-hop fan. R.I.P. Big L, the eternal king of hip-hop.
B000002TQV|4.0|While it has dated just a little since it's release, The Bends remains an absolutely essential rock album. The band would go on to do much bigger and better things on OKC, Kid A and HTTT, but this one has a special place in a lot of people's hearts. And with good reason. Should be 4.5 out of 5.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is a straight up work of art. The way Nas lays it out, tellin about the NY street life is something he or anyone else has never done. Everything Nas has put out combined falls short of Illmatic. Get back to the basics, man.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Rage Against the Machine plus Soundgarden minus all talent and innovation equals Audioslave! YAY!
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|This compilation of Peter Gabriel hits spans over the course of most of his career, except for (note taken) his second album, which seems to elude all of his compilations, except for 'Revisited'. On to analyzing this one, anyway...<br />To put together a Peter Gabriel compilation, as with any other great artist (with a solo career since 1977) is a tough job. But I dare to say that the aptly titled 'Hit' contains the essence of Peter's work, beyond what the 'Sixteen Golden Greats' compilation was able to accomplish. It includes material from his first album (&quot;Solsbury Hill&quot;, &quot;Here Comes The Flood&quot;), through the Melt (&quot;I Don't Remember&quot;, &quot;Family Snapshot&quot;, &quot;Biko&quot;, &quot;Games w/o Frontiers&quot;) and Security (&quot;San Jacinto&quot;, Rhythm of the Heat&quot;, &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;) albums of the early eighties to tracks from his more recent works, UP, OVO, US and SO.<br />Besides providing alternate mixes of previously released songs (&quot;Growing Up and &quot;The Tower&quot;) and a live version of the beautiful song from OVO track, &quot;Downside Up&quot; (which he performed while upside down alongside daughter Melanie during his Growing Up tour -don't miss his DVD from this tour that came out along with this compilation!!), Peter shares a couple of treats: previously unreleased track &quot;Burn You Up, Burn You Down&quot; (which will soon be available in a single format, if you prefer to skip the compilation altogether at your own risk); and &quot;Lovetown&quot; a song from the soundtrack of the Tom Hanks movie, 'Philadelphia' which has managed to stay somewhat on the fringes of Peter's production... until now!<br />My advice is the same for longtime Peter fans and for newbies into Peter's work: get &quot;Hit&quot;. Plus, at such a price (for two CDs) you really can't go wrong. With Peter, you can't go wrong!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Great album, the equal of their debut. Not much else to say really, if you liked Is This It, you'll like this. 'Under Control' is the best song they've written so far.
0385504209|5.0|This book is a great suspence conspiracy type novel written with great talent and imagination.  Too much.  I'm not sure if the Author is losing his grip between fact and fiction as I saw him on TV the other day talking about his book like it was truth.  The fact that Da Vinci painted Mary Magdalene at his last supper painting, doesn't mean he was married to her.  Da Vinci wasn't walking the earth at the same time Jesus was alive.  What gives people the Idea that Da Vinci has some inside knowledge on the life of Jesus. What a stretch, eh?  So, despite the book being a load, it's a well written one.  I'll give him that.  I also want to recommend the book, The Little Guide To Happiness.  It's a tiny cute little thing, but I thought it worth mentioning
B0000508U6|2.0|If you're one of those people who thinks The Bends is a better album than Kid A (hint: it ain't) then you're going to love this. Nice, inoffensive, catchy pop rock at it's most.. well... NICE. There's approximately a trillion (give or take a few million) bands who do this sort of thing much better, but Coldplay get the hype, so Coldplay get the sales. Enjoy!
0676973779|2.0|I read the book because the great comments that it will make you believe in God... but where was God? Only the first part says some things about religion very interesting firs chapter, but the body of the book is boring, monotonous and repetitive. It is true that it has some excitement at certain points but I was expecting a good book that will stay in my mind... but for sure it won't
B000089RVX|1.0|This CD has one of the most annoying album covers I have ever seen. And in this case, it's very wise to judge by the cover. What's inside is even more irritating.<br />Never mind that its members backpedaled on their Christian faith. The most offensive aspect of Evanescence is Evanescence itself-a calculated mix of sweet-sounding female vocals, nü-metal crunch, and a gruff shouty-guy who made the band sound like an evil version of The B-52's. At last report, the shouty-guy had unexpectedly exited Evanescence's European tour, perhaps never to return. Stay far, far away, shouty-guy. (The Onion AV)
B00006690G|5.0|I don't know how else to say it--unlike pretty much any rapper in history, or any musical performer period, Marshall Mathers writes brilliant, MEANINGFUL music. Having studdied the dictionary since he was young, and having a work ethic that would put pretty much anyone to shame, Eminem is not only a reflection of society, he is a brilliantly insightful man who is able to capture all of the human emotions and lend indirect insight (see The Way I Am from previous album) through his own experiences.<br />He is intelligent, he makes sense, he is real, down to earth, and the thing that separates him from everyone else out there in the industry is he has the most heart. You combine that with the brilliance, the fact that he is the greatest lyricist of all-time, one of the all-time great poets and philosophical thinkers, with charisma that can give people chills and goosebumps, and incredibly witty sarcastic humor, and you obviously have something special.<br />My Song-By-Song Reviews:<br />White America (3.5/5)--Eminem is always evolving with the times...the recent 9/11 attacks (at the time of this album's production) gave him the fresh material to get people to listen. But rather than offering his opinion (everyone's got one) on the national and international debate about military action and hatred and other such junk, he keeps it pertainent to his own life. Rapping over an explosive, ear grabbing beat, he delivers in an edgy, sarcastic tone \\"Erica loves my s---, I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get\\"...with Eric and Erica representing the son and daughter of everyone in America...it's the KIDS he raps for, and the adults he is often speaking to.<br />Business (3/5)--Has some humerous moments and mocks ICP.<br />Cleanin Out My Closet (5/5)--Potent song, Eminem furiously denies his pathological lying mother's claims that he just dissed her to get recognition, depicting his childhood in cold, incredibly moving tone. The brilliant video to this is a must see.<br />Square Dance(3/4)--Humerous, creative track that livens the mood in the beginning. Makes fun of Canibus and is the ultimate call-out.<br />Soldier(2.5/5)--A little too gloomy of a beat, but Eminem's incredible rapping skills make it worth listening to.<br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood(3/5)--More superb rapping from Eminem over a suspect beat, some good insight, but it could use a Dre beat here.<br />Drips(1/5)--Don't understand it...it might be funny, but it just didn't make sense to me after several listens.<br />Without Me(4/5)--Infectious beat, grows on you...listen to his rapping in the beginning, absolutely incredible energy and word play.<br />Sing For the Moment (6/5)--MASTERPIECE. Perhaps the greatest song ever written, the lyrics are as poignent as I've ever heard in a song, and the music is literally CLASSIC, produced by the members of the legendary rock and roll band Aerosmith. A sweet guitar solo at the end wraps up this song, which is one of the very, very few that deserves to the title of \\"masterpiece.\\"<br />Superman(3.5/5)--Has its moments, very humerous and is designed to satirize his reputation as a mysogenist...unfortunately, the accusers are too stupid and dogmatic to ever realize he's being facecious on this track, just like in \\"Kill You.\\"<br />Hailie's Song(5/5)--Eminem sings, and give it a chance, it will grow on you. He truly does have a very good singing voice, and the key is to play it a few times to really experience the emotion. In all seriousness, he sings better than 99.9% of the people out there in the industry today, at least he sings better than the POP stars. He has a nice voice. Of course, he's not Marvin Gaye or David Ruffin, but who is?! The one long line of rap in this song is probably the softest, most touching verse you'll ever hear, again showing that Eminem can and will break the rules of rap (for another example, listen to the track \\"Brain Damage\\" from a previous album). As Eminem gets into the song, especially in the lines \\"I'm crazy oh so crazy!\\" he proves he has a rare vocal range, showing glimpses that he could've possibly made it as a rock singer.<br />When The Music Stops(3/5)--All right, not really enough meaning here nor is the beat particularly mesmorizing, but it's an OK listen.<br />Say What You Say (4/5)--Dre and Eminem, ...I'm not real big on rap duos, but this is pretty good. Excellent ear catching word play and beat.<br />'Till I Collapse (6/5)--Powerful, explosive production, perhaps the greatest musical production of all-time. Eminem's production skills now rival Dr. Dre's...the intro and the hooks and the almost VISUAL dark surroundings he created are unfathomable. His energy and anger and wit all come through on this track as he just rips it.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy (4/5)--Hilarious, and intentionally retracts everything he'd said in Hailie's Song, kind of jokingly, basically saying, indirectly, \\"between you and me, that never happened\\" *WINK WINK*<br />Overall, if you're not an Eminem fan and feel you're not biased, try to download and listen to a few of these songs and give them a chance. You might be surprised.
B00004Z459|1.0|Are you an angsty teenager without a shred of original thought in your head? Of course you are! Well this is the CD for you.<br />One star is much, much too generous for this release, but it's the lowest I can give.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|i haven't seen the dvd yet but the cd is fantastic!  if you've ever seen coldplay live, and enjoyed them, you should definitely add this cd to your collection.  having been to many shows of theirs, i find listening to the cd brings me right back.  shiver gives me goosebumps.  moses is lovely.  the quality is fantastic - it beats all of my bootlegs hands down!
B000084T18|1.0|Yeah, we really needed another cartoon gangsta. He's been shot nine times, now lets all pray number ten finishes the job. 'Got Rich, Now Try Dyin''<br />Ugh.. This sucks.. Check out Dizzee Rascal's 'Boy In Da Corner' instead.
B00008EY9G|4.0|At first I didn't want to see this movie until a friend said it would be worth my while to do so. I'm glad she did because I wouldn't have wanted to miss it. This movie fits into the thriller category and begins with a rainstorm flooding out the roads. A variety of people are then forced to check into a roach motel. From a famous actress to a reformed prositute to a police officer transporting a convict, you see it all. One by one, murders start to happen with no clear cut reason as to why. However, as the movie progresses, pieces of the puzzle are put together. The ending of the movie is well worth the watch alone. This is a not-to-miss movie.
B000089CPF|5.0|Calexico's best album yet. How this mess of different sounds manages to pull together is anyones guess, but it works brilliantly.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Shut up the two before me, Coldplay is the greatest band in the world, and the fact that Chris is going out with gwyneth paltrow makes no difference to the music. A must buy for any Coldplay fan.
B00004RF98|5.0|Who cannot like Singin' in the Rain.  It is a musical masterpiece, a love sotry set up against a time of change in movie production.  Modern musicals like Moulin Rouge and Chicago have lost the magical touch, they are simply novelties that will die, but Singin' in the Rain will never die.  It is purely a classic and should remain untouched and ruined in any way.  The story takes place in 1920's, when the &quot;talkie&quot; movies where becoming more and more popular.  And, of course, the actors have to look good, right!  Well, Don Lockwood, played by Gene Kelly, looks and sounds pretty good, but what about his co-starlette, Lina Lamont.  Lina has no talent and her voice sounds like a pull string that was run over by a car.  How could the studio use such a bad actress.  Fortunately, Don encounters a pretty young lady named Kathy.  Kathy has the talent and the perfectly elegant voice that Lina lacks.  When the picture the studio is currently working on is turned into a talkie with Lina's bad acting and a ton of terrible sound problems, it is a diaster.  Meanwhile, Kathy and Don fall in love and Lina's jealousy is arosed.  Kathy, Don, and Cosmo then decide to make the film into a musical with Kathy's voice used to represent Lina's voice.  When Lina discovers what is up, she is furious and almost ruins the premier of the new musical.  However, there is a happy ending.  The music and dancing in this movie is absolutely amazing.  The songs are catchy, I sing snatches of them quite often.  Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are absolutely perfectly cast in this movie.  My mother, my sister, and I all love this musical.  Give it a chance, and maybe you may end up singin' in the rain yourself, with your prasies for this musical.
B00004T9UF|1.0|this guy is ... no words to describe the quality. This is utter s**t! Just because he is upset about something in his life or whatever (i agree with david, he has nothing to whine about, look at the starving millions of Rwanda!) doesn't mean complaining about it makes for good music.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I am a huge fan of movies. I do happen to like some musicals. My mom owns 40 something and has made me endure all 40 something of them. Chicago is a decent musical, but is more of a chick flick musical.<br />Chicago tells the story of Velma and Roxie Hart. Both vixens have commited murder and are trying to be the biggest vixens in town. They both get defended by Richard Gere's character who is the smoothest working lawyer in town. Will Roxie and Velma go and stay in jail for murder or will they run the night life of Chicago. You will just have to watch the movie and find out.<br />I liked Catherine Zeta Jones in Chicago. She is one of th most beautiful woman in the world. She is great as Velma. I dind't think she was as good as Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, but Catherine does a worthy job singing and dancing. She has a great voice and dances well. It's funny towards the end of the movie as you can see she is staring to show her pregnancy.<br />I didn't like Renee Zellweger that much. I don't think she is all that pretty of a woman. Catherine and Queen Latifah easily steal the show in my opinion. She sings and dances all right, but not as good as the others.<br />Richard Gere is smooth in the movie. This guy was my hero when I was younger and he was married to Cindy Crawford. He does a good job being the lawyer.<br />Girls and die hard musical fans will like Chicago. I don't think most guys will like it. I can see why it won best picture because it is a good film. It's just not a film I like that much.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The original matrix was excellent, and so i expected great things of this, but the sad truth is, it's just a load of guys in coats jumping about. Pretty cool, but not a good film. The extra features do have a very funny mini film thingy featuring Justin timberlake (i hate his music, but this is funny) and the effects ARE cool, so I give this 2 stars.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Thank you, W. Brothers!  Finally a huge movie has been made the doesn't cater to the 'lowest common denominator'!  Finally a movie that gives the audience some credit!  Finally a movie that strives to be something more than a tool to separate us from our money.  I've spent the last few hours thinking about revolutions, and the more i follow the path of the characters and the plot of the trilogy, the more connections i see...  and the more everything makes sense.  What goes around comes around, as they say. Not everything is answered of course, but that's half the point!   Consider it a puzzle, and you've gotta find a few of the pieces yourself.  Some people aren't gonna bother, and that's their choice, but really that's what it all comes down to anyway:  Choice.  THERE IS A POINT TO ALL THIS!  A MESSAGE!  And a good one, i think.  Every choice made by every character has an effect - as the Merovingian says.  If any of the main characters had not listened to their heart and choosen for self-preservation or cowardice or greed or whatever instead, the ripple effects from that small decision could have doomed them all.  If the 'marine-drill-sargeant' character hadn't trusted his instincts and let the 16 yr-old help, think of the consequences!  Or if Link's girl hadn't choosen to stay and help?  And there are endless examples of this in the trilogy.  The future of zion, and our future as well, depends not only on the decisions we make as a people but on those everyday decisions we make as individuals as well.  The Oracle embodies this message...  and by the end, Neo as well.  So thank you, everyone who brought this story and this vision to life.  You have chosen... wisely.
B00005JLSE|3.0|I disagree with the reviews that put this film on par with the stage production. As I saw it presented on B'way, Chicago had a sharp-edged cynical sense of humor that put vitality into so many of the projects Fosse worked on. The movie seems to have edged away in the direction of drama, and though the film may seem masterful in comparison to the bloated confusion of Moulin Rouge, Zellweger's, Zeta Jones's, and Gere's heroic attempts at singing and dancing  are off the mark, and the loss of humor is a disappointment. Veteran character and stage actor John C. Reilly, playing the humdrum hubby Amos, ironically provides the most interesting glimpse of the bittersweet energy at the core of the story. Queen Latifah also bucks up the production a bit. <br />The loss in transition to film is tangible. As presented on stage, the number \\"Cell Block Tango\\" was laugh out loud funny, as seemingly normal (and, of course, innocent) women expounded on being driven to homicide by acts ranging from gum-popping to more serious infractions. In the film, we get a familiar Hollywood type, [...],who apparently just likes to kill. Yawn. The backing dancers, like the leads, seem to have been selected for something other than dancing ability, and we're left with a pale reflection of what could have been.
B0000A118M|1.0|Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" is the most over-hyped jazz album in history. Is it music? Maybe. But I find it to be unlistenable, despite several efforts to find something good in it. Coltrane did some good work with Monk and Miles Davis. His ballads albums are good (\\"My Favorite Things;\\" \\"Ballads\\"), and also \\"Blue Train.\\"  But most of his later work is disappointing to one who likes classic jazz and hard bop.    Is my negative view of \\"A Love Supreme\\" a minority view? Obviously, most of the Amazon reviews are positive. But this is not a random sample of jazz fans. People usually buy what they already know they like. (Except me--I was a sucker for the hype and bought it before I heard it.) And people are more likely to take the time to write reviews of books and CDs that they like than those that they don't like. But for those who haven't bought it yet, you should be aware that Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" is mainly of historical interest. It is not the kind of music that most jazz fans would want to listen to over-and-over.  Furthermore, if it weren't for the legend that \\"A Love Supreme\\" was Coltrane's offering to God, then I don't think that many  people would be claiming to hear something spiritual in the music, and the album would not sell as much as it does.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|WORSE THAN THE FIRST.<br />(Rhyme NOT intended, bland flame not intended.)<br />Anyways, first off, yes Neo and Trinity DID pick up in their relationship, but they jumped too far at the beginning for me to bear. The rest of the time I was sleeping.<br />I understood it MUCH better than the first one, but the voicing is bad (think of when Morpheus says the word &quot;Machines&quot; during that speech, and you'll see what I mean.) As well as the fighting is really fake.<br />If this movie was supposed to be better, then I should have just said the first one was trash. the Agent Smith thing... wow, that was a bit.... much.<BR>Also, how can ONE guy suddenly pull a metal pole off the ground (Then again, in the Matrix anything is possible. Ha ha ha...) and SUDDENLY show immense skill with a bo staff and somehow KO a good percentage of this army of Agent Smiths?<br />Among the better things was the philosophy. I could take it. The talking was okay, in some ways, but the fighting was beyond unrealistic. It is like watching a rubber band fly off soem random gradeshcool kid's finger and fly into your face, I mean, really. You see, the fight scene right after we learned who the Keymaker was looked really rubberband-ish.<br />Other parts were just WAAAAAY too long, as well as the lack of emphasis on the plot and other preferences that would've been interesting, i.e., The Machines.<BR>In a war, both sides should have GOOD, substantuated(sp?) reasons to fight. Not just something like, &quot;Oh, hey, let's go attack the humans and enslave them since we're machines. Har, har, har.&quot;<br />The only part I thought really rocked was the freeway scene. I mean, really, that was the only super-great part that is still fresh in my head. Wow, I cna ahrdly remember Matrix I though, how come I remember this...?<BR>Oh, yeah, wait, if the rest of the parts weren't as good, one scene that was good (according to your peferences.) sticks out. <br />Otherwise, if there's just action and no plot, the movie/idea is easily passed over. Too much talking and no movement can also ruin a story/movie.<br />It was a good movie, but I can attest that the word movie shouldn't have been used as some SCENES only seemed truly memorable. (And for you sickos that like to see the stuff waaaay too early in the movie, the xxx scene.)<br />                       ~Kokeshi088~<br />P.S. Personally, I also liked that sword fight, sheesh, a lotta things are better with swords, in this case a *little* bit better.<br />P.P.S. Also, we can now prove that the character &quot;Neo&quot; (Keanu Reeves) does NOT have scoliosis, as proven in a certain scene that was a but... rushed. At least I think it was rushed. (They must do this stuff only to please people, right? It's almost like doing something silly and out of place just to win a bet, you know?)
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This film is all about superficiality and nothing more.  The fight sequences are silly as they're doing nothing more than dancing ---resurrecting those silly chop sockey choreographies I grew up watching as a kid.  I'm glad my brother rented this dvd as I would never pay to see this.
B00000K19E|3.0|Now, as I can last recall, this movie.... I can't remember anyhting since 1999.<BR>It's almost like a DragonballZ episode, all action, then about 3 years later, you forgot EVERYTHING. I mean, just about everywhere, people remember exactly WHO said, &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot;.<br />I say that the plot was bland at some point; where there are two sides, there are two stories, and being the picky eprson I am, I would have personally liked to see more emphasis on the &quot;other&quot; side, the Machines. Worse enough, I can also say that while the idea is interesting...<br />I still say it doesn't make sense. If a machine was to become that intelligent, then some things would be obselete, another, the technological terms are a bit too... today? I mean, way back when, who ever heard of a &quot;lightsaber&quot;? Yeah, NOBODY! Creativity, huh? Huh? I mean, yeah, I can see hacker in the future, but the word &quot;program&quot;? Oh, COME ON!<br />Otherwise, I'd like to see much stronger emphasis on the other side(s) as well as something to totally screw up the plot and make it harder for &quot;Neo&quot; (Keanu Reeves). After seeing &quot;Reloaded&quot;, I was primarily disappointed with the slownesss of the story, still, unlike the confusing &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; here. I'm a geek. Shoot me.<br />Also, here's a little common sense: Isn't it a bit.... wrong if former slaves enslave their masters?<br />Other than that, for me, I'm not too happy with how the characterization was done, could have had more personality here, no? Also, here's a problem HUMANITY! Isn't this (hu)man vs. machine? And isn't the perspective MOST people are viewing the humans? Darn, we really screwed up our race then, if this is the meaning of being human.<br />No, really, in a lot of movies like this it seems that we humans have forgotten what it means to be human! Hence our punishment. Other than that, get ready to hear my Reloaded rants someday! Because I'll have a LOT.<br />Like a FEW other people out there, yes, I was rooting for the machines. But for other reasons than the fact that the movie &quot;sucked&quot;.<br />And yes, we really have forgotten what it means to be human, not to mention the human characters hardly seemed *ahem* human, sentient, and/or understanding.<br />I think the only thing people think of when we say &quot;human&quot; is the human race. That's it. I'm sorry, but, if that's the new meaning to the word &quot;human&quot;, then shoot me. I don't wanna be human anymore. (I'd much rather be a half-eaten ham and cheese sandwich, right now...)<br />I mean, isn't there supposed to be a plot? *ahem* PLOT??? And emphasis.<br />A movie with this much philosophy needs a stronger plot and more than just one perspective. This movie, it's all just really one-sided.<br />And the reason WHY this movie is no longer on my perosnal &quot;top movies list&quot; and why I gave it such a beating. Which really isn't that much, but this is constructive criticism, mind you.<br />                                      ~Kokeshi088~<br />P.S. I think out of the box. It's a gift. :)
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I cannot stand these movies now a days where substance is sacrificed for special effects,computer generated animation, silly 1970's chop socky fighting, and glitsy camera tricks that seems to be the norm for movies coming out today.  Gladly X2 surprised me.  This is by far the best action movie I've seen in a long time.  The characterization is wonderful and never corny (almost) and the fight sequence especially with wolverine and deathstrike is excellent.
B000002HAF|2.0|If you're expecting an album as consisten as Doolittle, save your money.  There are only three good songs on this album, Cactus, Where is My Mind? and Gigantic.  Everything else is nearly unlistinable.  Most of the songs don't sound &quot;finished&quot;.  Some tracks arn't even songs, like Vamos, its just dumb filler. And Tony's Theme is just plain embarassing.  I've listened to this alubum a number of times but I can't see what the big deal is.  Their later albums are much better.
B000003TA4|5.0|&quot;Nevermind&quot; is the album that revolutionized mainstream rock music. While not necessarily grunge like its predecessor &quot;Bleach&quot; or even &quot;In Utero,&quot; there is no denying the impact Nevermind has had on the music industry. As a big Nirvana fan, I would say Nevermind is Nirvana's second best album behind In Utero. Nevermind is certainly more radio-friendly and popular and with good reason. I'm going to rate each of the tracks as unbiased as possible to give you an idea how good this album is. It is one of the best of all time.<br />1. Smells Like Teen Spirit - Their most popular song, if you haven't heard this you probably haven't turned on the radio or TV at any point during the 1990s. It's an amazing song that summed up the frustrations young people were going through at that time. This is one of the greatest songs of all time. 10/10<BR>2. In Bloom - Another hit single, In Bloom is about their fans. Also gets a lot of radio play and is one of their best. 10/10<BR>3. Come As You Are - A great song that has an amazing beat. Another hit single on the radio constantly.  10/10<BR>4. Breed - More of a Grunge/Alternative Rock sound to it, this one sounds like it can come right off In Utero. 9.5/10<BR>5. Lithium - Yet another amazing song, about bi-polar disorder. One of Nirvana's best. 10/10<BR>6. Polly - A song about rape in the perspective of the rapist. A good, solid rock song. 8/10<BR>7. Territorial Pissings - A loud, noisy rock song with the beginning of it showing Kurt Cobain's Beatles' influence. This is probably the worst song on the album but it is not bad at all. 7/10<BR>8. Drain You - One of my favorite Nirvana songs of all time. 10/10<BR>9. Lounge Act - A grunge song that sounds a little weird but there is no denying its sheer power. 9/10<BR>10. Stay Away - It's good but not as good as the others. 7.5/10<BR>11. On A Plain - A great grunge song with sarcastic lyrics. 9/10<BR>12. Something In The Way - A mellow Nirvana song which showsKurt's emotions. A nice relaxing song to listen to, and I find it similar to In Utero's last song, &quot;All Apologies&quot; although Something In The Way isn't as moving. 8/10<BR>13. Endless, Nameless - For those of you who aren't hardcore Nirvana fans, this is the secret track on Nevermind. There are several versions of the lyrics to this song and its meanings have been questioned. It doesn't sound like anything off of Nevermind and since it's not on the standard copies I won't rate it. <br />Well there you have it. One of the greatest albums of all time summed up track by track for you. Hope this helped. Oh and by the way, BUY IT. IT'S AWESOME!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|One of the most hyped movies of 2003 was The Matrix Reloaded. Not only did it seem to promise excellent action scenes but also a complex and intelligent plot. Well I saw it in the theaters and I knew right away that this movie was nothing-close quality wise to the original. The effects were less astounding and impressive due mostly to bad CG and the plot and dialogue was very cheesy and overall completely pretentious. It also seems the movie tried to be more erotic than the last, which is all right in my books, but there is no gain in a 20-min. rave scene and is a waste of film in my opinion. But don't get me wrong there was a couple of neat scenes in this film (mostly in the freeway chase) and was by no means a terrible film. Overall the movie was decent enough and worth a rental, hopefully Revolutions will be better.<br />INTERESTING FACT: The special effects cost $100 million U.S.*<BR>*Source IMDB
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|There's two songs worth mentioning, &quot;Blue&quot; &amp; &quot;Weak and Powerless.&quot; The first track starts things off well, and leaves you thinking &quot;this should should rock&quot;, but it doesn't. The rest of this CD just disappoints me, and doesn't live up to the expectations of the first, which is much better by far and only one song I don't like. Remember the whole &quot;terd on a painting&quot; being art...this is the same thing. Trying to be artistic I suppose, but this CD pops in my player every now and then just for a two songs.  I bought this because I'm fascinated by Maynard's lack of understanding the common sense about anything pure. As a christian and a conservative, I do enjoy good music, and would recommend Mer de Noms to anyone who isn't sensitive to a little blasphemy. This...it's not even the same members, which must be the best explanation for why I sincerely hope their next effort(if any) tops their debut. Come on man, you can do better than this. You're tumbling like Toad the Wet Sprocket. Quit the whining, stop being political or expressing your social views, and the music will always sounds better.

B00005JKN9|5.0|I don't understand any of the negative reviews. I loved this movie. The acting was amazing accross the board. Lewis was perfect, as was DiCaprio and Diaz even did a very good job in the movie.<br />The movie has a simple and personal story in the center of everything that is going on in the movie.  At the heart of the movie is DiCaprio seeking vengence for the death of his father.<br />Scorsese has this simple story to tell and put it in the middle of this epic movie about a time in history many no little about.<br />This made the film feel original and vibrant.<br />The movie never feels overlong or slow. This movie is filled with life.  The action is exciting. The visuals are awe inspiring. and the acting is as good as it gets.<br />In my opinion Martin has created his greatest masterpiece with this film.<br />I loved this movie

B00008WG3U|5.0|NOFX is an amazing band, they stick to what they believe in.  They dont give in to mainstream society.  This CD truly shows the roots of what NOFX is about.  Recommend this CD for those who believe in being true to who you are.
0385504209|1.0|By claiming historical accuracy in a short preface to the novel, Dan Brown's book is no longer &quot;just fiction&quot; but purports itself to be a historical study.  As such, it would receive a failing grade in most college history courses.<br />Brown blatantly ignores the careful research of legitimate ancient, medieval, and early-modern historians, theologians, and literary critics and chooses instead to rely upon reactionary, conspiracy-centered, non-scholarly studies from the 1980s.  Publisher's Weekly admits its own ignorance by deeming the book &quot;exhaustively researched&quot;: obvious factual errors, the absence of notation and bibliography, the mishandling and/or disregard of extant primary documents, and a tendancy to accept new theories without bothering to properly criticize the old ones; this is not &quot;exhaustive research&quot; at all.<br />Other than the mere existence of Opus Dei, nearly every historical &quot;fact&quot; here can be or has already been challenged and proven false by historians (including every &quot;authoritative&quot; book that the character Teabing refers to).  The author either knows this (and is thus intentionally spreading misinformation) or is completely ignorant (and therefore has not researched his topic &quot;exhaustively&quot;), but it is you, the readers, who are being misled while paying for the privledge.
B00005Y7KH|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Yellow&quot; by Coldplay, the thing that caught my attention was how smooth this band's sound was. Upon purchasing the album, I found that I couldn't take it out of my CD player for weeks. Coldplay is definitely a breath of fresh air in the music world. The album follows, almost methodically, a perfect pattern from song-to-song. If you're one who likes to listen to an album all the way through, this album gladly gives you the honor. I recommend it to anyone in need of comfort on a cloudy day.
B00005JM02|5.0|This Movie was amazing, For all of you who haven't seen it go rent it.  Ellen was the perfect voice for Dory and all characters in this movie were developed and had wonderful personalities.  For adults who are sick of watching kids movies because most of them are geared toward kids and have nothing for the adults to enjoy this is one that you will love and so will your kids.  So if I were you I would definetly buy this.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I fell in love with Sarah's music after listening to Fumbling Towards Ecstasy from beginning to end and not even realizing it.  I also loved Surfacing, even though I felt there was some inconsistency to it.  With Afterglow, her celestial voice shines through superbly, especially on the track \\"Answer\\".  But there is something lacking in the writing of the lyrics.  With most music, I'm usually able to tell what the next rhyme will be, what the next predictable line is.  With Sarah's last two albums, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Sarah is a true chameleon with words.  There's words where you think they wouldn't fit, but somehow perfectly do.  On Afterglow, this seems to be in absence on a lot of tracks.  Granted, the music is superb and her conveyence of emotion is heart-felt, but the message seems to be a little too routine.
B000002AP1|5.0|Being a fan of the Detroit sound, (Motown, Mc5, Funkadelic John Lee Hooker etc..)I had looked at the Stooges as the Guns -n- Roses of the 70's full of passion but self- destructive.After listening to Raw Power again ,I have to say that this is the ultimate American rock-n-roll record totally agressive, dark, but full of passion (yes, funhouse is better)but Raw Power has better production values and Bowie's mix is better than Iggy's remix (Bowie as other reviewers had said came in after Iggy screwed up the first mix)And Iggy's mix is too high in many places and really doesn't add anything new  to the original album.
0316666343|5.0|Written from the perspecitve of a 14-year-old rape and murder victim speaking from heaven, The Lovely Bones is sure to infect even the most emotionally distant reader with unbelievable senses of sorrow, frusteration, and rage.<br />Susie Salmon watches from heaven as her family tries their hardest to cope with her death as her killer runs free.  While the main plot of the novel seems depressing enough, this book causes the reader to realize the little details in life that mean so much, but go unnoticed.<br />Susie also explores &quot;her heaven&quot;, and learns more about herself and what she truly wants.  This concept promises for an extremely moving ending which left me in tears.  While her counselor in heaven insists that she disconnects herself with the living world, Susie cannot let go.  She watches as her sister makes her way through high school and into college, as her little brother grows up, and as one of her classmates tries to uncover the truth.<br />Haunting and strangely comforting at the same time, The Lovely Bones is a must-read for any avid or casual reader.  Explore the shadows of death, the frusteration of hope, and the love that brings both the living and the dead together forever.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Everytime I go to the movie rental store I want to rent this movie. None of my friends have ever heard of it and I cannot believe that! This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. It hits every emotion-sorrow, pity, humor, love, heartbreak. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Watching this is not time wasted. If you are a big music fan, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is a definite must watch. I didn't have a favorite scene, it was all good! I am dumbfounded as to why more people haven't seen this movie. WATCH IT! IT'S ENTERTAINING AND TOUCHING!
B00003CXCD|5.0|What a wonderful movie! What a great romantic fantasy!<br />It is one of my all-time favorites, one of the films I could watch several times, without getting bored.<br />I don't think that the plot is important here, but the way the actors performed and the place where the story is set.<br />In Rome, a European princess manages to escape the rigid and boring life and have and unforgettable experience, living for one day as a normal person. She does all the things that she was not allowed to do before, such as cutting her hair, eating ice-cream, strolling down the streets and why not, falling in love with an ordinary man.<br />This is the role that brought Audrey Hepburn an Oscar and made her a well-known star.<br />It is the natural and ingenuous performance that makes her such a charming and unforgettable character, a graceful presence on the screen.<br />Her companion is Gregory Peck who has also a great performance and makes the film even more delightful. He plays the part of a young and charming journalist, looking for news that might increase sales of his newspaper and bring some money in his pocket.<br />The DVD includes also a section with a kind of &quot;making of&quot;: interviews of the people who participated at the shooting, memories, etc. This is even more interesting, as you will have the chance to listen to the people who were involved in this project, and the stories behind the scene. You will also see that time did not alter too many of Audrey Hepburn's features and even at an older age she still looks refined and elegant.<br />I have one complain about this movie: 118 minutes seemed to be not enough for such a romantic story. I believe that everyone of us would like to dream about what is like to be lost in the &quot;eternal city&quot; for one day and enjoy the simple things of life.
0345409671|2.0|_Memnoch_ is not a well-written book. I've never been a huge Rice fan, and _Memnoch_ does not change my opinion, but I do believe it is better than the average Rice novel simply because the idea is somewhat intriguing. Some of the theology is entertaining and having the Devil as a main character is always a good selling point. As usual, Rice is overlong and belabors the point ad naseum, but at least she is trying to accomplish something here. When Lestat is not talking to the Devil, he is constantly preoccupied with another character's menstration and there is plenty of needless and boring explication of exactly how many levels of angels there are and every step of the creation of the universe. I can't recommend the book. But it is better than the trash that the two previous books in the series have been. Disclaimer: avoid the book if you are offended by religious images or ideas that are unorthadox.
0385486804|5.0|I have never read a book quite like this one. It brooded like a ghost that haunts dwarf aspens growing along muskeg on a windy Alaskan afternoon. Who cares about the death of foolish young man who selfishly forsakes all who love him to live in the wilds of Alaska by himself, and that without adequate preparation? If God cared, why did he let the young man die so needlessly, so close to rescue, while his parents and others were praying for him? <br />These are some of the questions that came to mind as I read this fascinating, sad, and truthful story. I am glad that Krakauer granted Christopher the dignity of telling his story. Krakauer's own &quot;flash-back&quot; scene of foolish outdoor escapades as a young man, itself a remarkable adventure story, helps explain his interest. <br />I grew up partly in Southeast Alaska, and sometimes confused it with heaven; Krakauer corrects that mistake. This is more a Jack London Alaska, with a bit of Tolstoy thrown in.  Tolstoy, too, was an idealistic, tormented man, driven to an ill end. <br />In some ways, this book could be described as an American Death of Ivan Ilyich.  (One of the books Christopher read in the wilderness.)  Krakauer doesn't follow up on the lead, but it strikes me that Christopher's final message, was one Ilych might have written, had he been able: &quot;I have had a happy life and thank the Lord. Goodbye and may God bless all!&quot;  Ironically, Christopher's suffering drove two people who loved him away from God.  But it seems Christopher himself may have had some kind of experience with God as he was dying, to make his story a bit less the tragedy and riddle for him that it remains for the rest of us.
B00005JM02|5.0|Let me just echo what so many have said here -- this movie is truly just remarkable in its scope and achievement.  The jaw-dropping animation just goes beyond anything seen before... to make animated water look so fluid and so REAL is quite a task, and the folks at Pixar have pulled it off splendidly.  The story is great, and although the title is \\"Finding Nemo\\" the journey really belongs the one who is doing the finding -- Marlin.  To me, that's what the story is about:  His growth and his discovery.  There are moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity and moments that are really quite wrenching.  When Dory is imploring Marlin to stay with her, and says, with the deepest of sincerity and a hint of desperation, \\"When I look at you, I'm HOME,\\" it's hard not to get teary-eyed.  Any movie that can make you laugh and move you to tears (repeatedly, no less) in the span of 100 minutes definitely deserves some consideration.  The voices are spot-on, and the music had moments of sublime emotion.  I was glad to see Pixar move on from having Randy Newman do a cheesy song in every one of their films.  While they seemed appropriate in the \\"Toy Story\\" movies, they seemed just a little less so in \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", and wouldn't have worked at all in \\"Finding Nemo\\".  The attention to detail in the rendering of the various fishes and marine life was exquisite.<br />My favorite?  Had to be the seagulls.  Mine. Mine. MineMine.  Minemine Mine mine!  Mine minemine.  Mine.  Genius!<br />The 2-DVD set is fantastic.  It gives you both the widescreen and fullscreen presentations (each on a separate disc), along with a wealth of special features, behind-the-scenes information, and commentary.  It's often disappointing when a truly great movie gets a second-rate treatment in the DVD release.  \\"Finding Nemo\\" is, happily, not in this category -- the DVD release is a wonderful complement to the brilliance of the film it contains.<br />This movie really should win some awards, although I figure most people can already predict that \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" will have a huge cache of gold statues after the Oscars, which is as it should be.  I truly believe that if you have this DVD and \\"The Lion King\\" DVD in your collection, you have what may be two of the finest animated films ever made.<br />P.S.  About the \\"mate/mine\\" seagull confusion, I think I remember finding something online a couple of months ago about this and it was a HUGE ugly controversy (amazing what some people will get into name-calling arguments over) -- some even swore that the seagulls were saying \\"Mike\\" -- however, on the subtitles, and on the DVD director's commentary, it's made very clear that the only word the seagulls know is \\"mine.\\"
B000060P79|2.0|Good guys, bad band. Four words that describe this Canadian band perfectly. Let's face it, their music is terrible. Only whiny tenagers would enjoy this garbage. However, I admit that thee guys are hilarious and they did try very hard so for that they deserve a two. If you want good Canadian talent, try Sum 41.<br />WHY YOU SHOULD BUY IT<BR>-You feel sorry for them.<BR>-You truly LIKE this garbage.<br />WHY YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF<BR>-You hate poppy pop punk and have somewhat good taste.
B000002JPA|5.0|When I first heard Pull Me Under, and especially Take the Time, on a local radio station, I HAD to remember the name of the band so I could buy the release!  Ever since acquiring Images and Words, this has continued to be about the best release I have ever owned.  The only CD that is in the same category (albeit a MUCH different style) is &quot;A Pleasant Shade of Gray&quot; by Fates Warning.  Otherwise, I can't imagine another release approaching the magnitude of this CD, even by Dream Theater.  <br />Learning to Live is the most amazing song I ever heard!  I think I have memorized every note, time signature change, etc., and I'm STILL not tired of listening to it.  Haunting melodies, tremendous guitar and drum riffs, beautiful keyboards; it just doesn't get any better than this for a progressive rock fan!
B00005JKJA|1.0|This movie was strange, perplexing, and unsatisfying.  Even after reading several of the five-star reviews on this site, I still do not understand why this movie got such critical acclaim, or why it was nominated for an academy award.<br /><br />I rented this movie because of the rave reviews quoted on the cover, claiming that it was \\"hypnotic\\" \\"beautiful\\" and \\"suspenseful\\".  Talk about false advertising - was I ever surprised!  It was one of the worst movies I can ever remember watching.  The beginning is somewhat interesting, but it quickly deteriorates into a confusing, tedious, rambling mess.  I kept hoping that it would improve, but it didn't.  Sitting through this film was an unpleasant experience...
B00005JMFR|2.0|From the end of The Matrix: Reloaded we know Neo is back in the real world, we know something is different about him and we know in the last film somehow he is going to save the world. The Matrix: Revolutions opens where reloaded left off, but almost immediately the movie feels entirely different. From the first five minutes on the movie leads up the battle for Zion. This would be alright, the problem is the movie drags on slowly with a whole lot of nothing happening untill the machines reach Zion, Neo's character is isolated and becomes weaker and weaker, in the end he does save day (no big surprise), but the method is a cheap shop by the screenwriters, the big end battle for Zion is instantly forgetable (all 20+ minutes of it) and we're left with no clouser, what's worse the ending is left wide open for even more Matrix movies.
B00000K19E|5.0|Neo has been looking for something.  He doesn't know what, but he knows there is something not right with the world he lives in.  By day, he is a computer programmer, working for a faceless corporation, by night he sells illegal \\"narcotic\\" software, living in a concealed world while searching for something more.<br />It all changes when he meets Morphius and discovers that his world, that everything he has always questioned, is nothing more than an elaborate matrix developed by a computer technology that long ago took control of the world.  The balance of the story becomes Neo's quest for understanding, as he learns to go beyond the boundaries set by the matrix and struggles for the freedom of mankind.<br />This is one of the most stylized films I have ever seen.  It is at once dark, sleek, paranoid, lavish, lush and abysmal.  The world that is created in this film is so completely convincing, that moviegoers will be mesmerized by its epic style of storytelling and subtle blending of reality with the computer generated fantasy that Neo, Morphius and Trinity move through, while fighting to gain supremacy over the machines.<br />The story itself is a common theme.  Technology gains the upper hand on humanity and takes control.  However, unlike so many of these stories, the Matrix goes beyond the simple narrative and instead pushes our limits to accept what we see as real, only to remove the veil and leave us pondering our own perceptions of reality.  <br />Filmed with state-of-the-art cameras, the special film effects are incredible.  At one point, early in the film, Trinity is confronted by an entourage of police officers.  As she fights for her freedom, she raises into the air, and as though frozen in time, the camera moves impossibly around her.  <br />For those who have seen this film, the forementioned scene, and others like it are explained in the \\"making of\\" portion of the DVD.  Packed with many extras, the DVD will take you into the world of the Matrix and introduce you to the first installment of a film franchise which has been elevated by moviegoers around the world to something akin to a religious experience.<br />So, enter the Matrix if you dare.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JM02|5.0|I do believe that \\"Finding Nemo\\" is by far my new favorite Disney DVD. The film is great, but the extras go above and beyond. Marlin (Albert Brooks) has lost his son Nemo to a diver who lives in Sydney, Australia. Marlin braves jellyfish, sharks, and whales to get his boy back. Along the way he meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a sweet hearted blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Still, she can read and knows the address that is in the mask the diver left behind. Each character in this movie is wonderful, and there are plenty of laughs throughout. Be aware, though, that there are some emotionally difficult scenes that may be slightly disturbing for younger viewers. The extras included on this DVD are great:<br />CHOICE OF WIDESCREEN OR STANDARD PICTURE<br />TURN YOUR T.V. INTO A VIRTUAL AQUARIUM: love fish tanks but hate the work? Pop you FN DVD in and have your own virtual aquarium playing in the background!<br />STORYTIME FUN FOR THE YOUNG: Children can read themselves, or have a narrator read to them the story \\"Nemo Goes to School\\"<br />MR. RAY'S ENCYCLOPEDIA: Learn about every sea creature featured in the movie.<br />PLAY \\"FISHARADES\\": The school of fish form pictures bit by bit, and you have to guess what it is before they're done.<br />PIXAR ANIMATION CLASSIC SHORT \\"KNICK KNACK\\": The animation short shown in theaters before FN, this 3:50 minute short tells the tale of a snowman in a snowglobe that wants to get out. My son remembered it and asked to watch that first before I'd even popped the DVD in.<br />EXTRAS FOR ADULTS: Usually, kids aren't interested in the \\"making of\\" extras, or \\"filmaker's visual commentary\\", so these are pretty much here for grown ups. Oh yeah- there's,also deleted scenes.<br />EXPLORING THE REEF WITH JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU (son of Jacques Cousteau, in case you were wondering): By far the best feature is this tour of the coral reef. As Cousteau narrates, Dory, Marlin and Nemo interrupt him, frustrate him, and upstage him. I laughed all the way through.<br />Above and beyond that, you get a fabulous movie with amazing animation. Be prepared, though, for a more PG theme than i advertised. The peril these fish go through, along with the \\"death\\" of Marlin's wife can be very traumatic for a child who's not expecting it. Be ready to reassure them.ay through.<br />Above and beyond that, you get a fabulous movie with amazing animation. Be prepared, though, for a more PG theme than i advertised.

B0000C7PRY|5.0|Just when you thought things couldn't get any better after the last Transatlantic's cd and Spock's Beard's Snow lp, Neal Morse pulls off his best work yet in Testimony.  This album should appeal to any Progrock fan.  Fans of Spock's Beard and Transatlantic should eat this album up ... as well as fans of GENESIS, YES, AND KANSAS.  Neal gets help on this one from former band mate and long time friend Mike Portnoy (the best drummer on the planet)!  Mike's drumming is fantastic throughout, but his work on &quot;The Storm Before the Calm&quot; is worth the price of admission alone.  Kerry Livgren of KANSAS also makes a nice guest appearance on guitar.  But Neal is the real hero here, hitting on all cylinders especially on the keys.  This album is proof, you can leave an outstanding band and become even better.<br />Pick this album up and enjoy!<br />P.S. THANKS NEAL!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|AFTERGLOW is the first album released by Ms. Mclachlan for five years.  What a treat it is!  While only 10 songs, each is filled with her signature voice and lyrics.  From &quot;Fallen&quot; to &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; I was enraptured by the album, and did not skip one song.  <br />Highly Recommended.

B00005RRG9|5.0|I love this movie in its original version. When I saw that they made a new one I was upset. I refuse to go see it. I feel that the original movie was awesome. It is a good movie for the whole family. They should've never made a new version. To me just by seeing the commercials for the remake I feel that the remake took away from the original. I hope that I am not the only one who feels this way.

B00005221L|3.0|Predator is a horror/action movie that was most likely inspired by Alien.This one has all of the elements of an Arnold adventure (the big guns, unforgettable quotes, etc.) but tends to lack the good story and spellbinding suspense and action. At first there was a good Commando-like plot that started it all as 'rescue the hostages and say hasta lavesta baby to the baddies'. The creators did well with bringing the story into play; they didn't just say 'alien come and beat up ahnold'. It started to lose the charm with its lack of dialogue and adventure. Instead, it was just mindless shooting and running through the jungle. Yeah, that's what makes it realistic but they overdid the realism. This still deserves three stars, though, but just isn't Arnold Schwarzenegger material.
B00004BZ16|1.0|This Cd Is Crap Crap Crap!!! No Good Songs , Sounds Horrible and was a waste of my 19.99 at my mall. This is so bad!! blam this horible work. People who listen to this should try listening to OPERATION IVY.
6300214028|1.0|<br /><BR>This movie has an awful lot of chutzpah, but does not go so far as to try to glamorize communism - at least not as it developed in the early Soviet.  <br />But communism was a hideous and genocidal ideology.  And Warren Beatty needed to justify John Reed's (clearly Beatty's alter ego) attachment to it.  So he gave Reed something to hate - namely his parents.<br />Communism was as much about hatred as it was about ideology.  This movie unintentionally shows that.  The movie treats Reed's parents in a gratuitously ugly manner.  I guess Beatty thinks that if you mock the people you hate - they somehow deserve it.<br />I'm glad this movie was made, because this imaginary autobiography by Warren Beatty's could have been written by a whole class of people in the baby boom generation.  It does not hide the hatred at its core.  That's a good thing to have as part of the historical record.  <br />If he matures well, Warren Beatty will one day be embarrassed by this movie he made.
B000002GQH|5.0|As with most Moody Blues albums, the listener is treated to a unique introduction (\\"In The Beginning\\").  In the late sixties, singles were a way to promote albums.  Hayward's \\"Lovely To See You\\" (U.S.A.) and \\"Never Comes The Day\\" (U.K.) were not high markers on the charts, but a good indication of what this classic album had to offer.<br />Thomas provides the 'near' spoken word song, \\"Dear Diary\\" and Lodge gives us the pleasant, but tepid rocker \\"Send Me No Wine\\".  The other songs on the album maintain the surrealistic mood with an almost hypnotic pace.  Mike Pinder orchestrated the legendary sequence of \\"Have You Heard, Pt. 1 and Pt. 2\\" with \\"Voyage\\" in between; cementing the Moody Blues mellotron sound and securing the group it's psychedelic status.<br />This is considered to be one of the most popular albums produced by Tony Clarke; \\"On The Threshold Of A Dream\\" was the Moody Blues first #1 album.  This positive collection ensured that the group was a self contained unit and not a flash in the pan.  It is a beautiful piece of work.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Loved the entire soundtrack.  Very Pirate-y.  I could envison the entire movie by listening to the tracks.  Would highly recomment this CD to all you POTC fans.
0714843377|2.0|What a book - beginning with what is the title supposed to be saying? &quot;The world's best selling book&quot; - is this the best selling book in the whole wide world?  What about the Bible, or many other blockbusters? Or is it just a (as in one of many) best-seller? Could this be prosecuted for mis-representation?<br />Then the flyleaf compares this book to Sun Tzu's &quot;Art of War&quot; and Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince&quot; - ok so he's not exactly modest?<br />There are some useful comments, such as <br />'develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end'<BR>'don't promise what you can't deliver'<BR>But then the second half of the book becomes exclusively about the advertising industry, with very little benefit to anyone else. The cover doesn't say where he got his experience, so you don't get warned its about the advertising industry.<br />But the best thing was right at the end, &quot;Life's Creative Circle&quot; showing the stages of life from 0-100, eg <BR>30-40 = 'hell bent on success', <BR>40-45 = 'repeating success', <BR>45-50 = 'trying to keep up with the 25-year-olds', <BR>50-60 = 'reinventing yourself'. <BR>Not everyone would agree with all the descriptions, such as 75-85 = 'youth regained', as that's not quite the case for the 50%+ of the population who don't live that long, but it gives some ideas.<br />The book is cheap, but if it was $5 more it wouldn't be worth it.
0385504209|5.0|. . .  if you give this book a one star review and venomous criticism?  Clearly, Mr. Brown, whether you like it or not, has tapped into a hot-button topic with this story; the book has sold millions of copies and will surely be remembered as one of the top-selling novels of the decade. For all the naysayers out there--this is fact, whether you like it or not. If you can write so much better than Mr. Brown (and I would hope that you can, as you seem to be such insightful critics), write your own book, sell a few million copies, and shut up. Nuff said.
0380002930|5.0|I'll make this review really short and sweet. This book is the best book I've ever read. It totally tops &quot;classics&quot; like Catcher in the Rye or Oliver Twist, because this story has way more heart than those stories, and yet it's a compelling adventure, once you look past the fact that adams is talking about rabbits. Even though it's a long read, I promise that you'll be hooked.
B000089RVX|4.0|This CD has been praised as the next big thing.  It also has been called pathetic and an exploitation, just an extension of nu-metal.  It is neither.  What this album has is a refreshing outlook on hard rock.<br />Females in rock is nothing new.  Females singing melodically over rock is somewhat different though in mainstream music.  And it works very well...Evanescence wrote some extremely catchy tunes with meaning, but also throw in a good deal of variety on the album at points, with ballads and slower gothic type songs that show of Amy Lee's impressive vocal range.  However, the CD does seem a bit front-loaded...the better material is definetely among the first 6-7 tracks.<br />One thing that always urked me is how Bring Me To Life immediately brought Linkin Park comparison.  This is the ONLY song with a male voice, and the only song with even a trace of rap in it.  Plus, the band does not have a DJ...they use several styles of music, but there is no scratching of records or the like.  This is not a female-Linkin Park...and that is a good thing.<br />Evanescence may be on top of the world now...their second album will determine their fate (especially with the departure of lead guitarist Ben Moody).  While Lacuna Coil is overall a stronger and more hypnotic band, Evanescence managed to deliver a sure hit, and really opened the door for a lot of female led rock bands.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I almost didn't buy this because I didn't really want to own a cd with a half naked woman on it.  I'm glad it got this.  Christina A is one of the most brilliantly talented vocalists out there.  She can do pop, rock, r&amp;b, hip hop, and all that.  My favorite songs are Beautiful and Fighter.
0802130208|5.0|There's not much really to say about this book other than read it.  The main character is great.  By the end of the book you are cheering for him.  But it is not for the unimaginative.  To really appreciate this book, you must be able to get inside of it and dissect it.
B00005JMFR|5.0|So you think you had the whole concept of the Matrix figured out? You think you knew how this one was gonna end? Well chances are you don't. I must say one thing to those of you who are saying (and might say once you see it) that this movie wraps it up too nicely: This movie is not the end. This doesn't wrap things up cozily no matter what you think. As far as this movie goes... The fight for Zion is AMAZING, the story and action keep you engaged, and YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED!!!  :D
B000002UAO|5.0|First of all, I want to counter the previous 1 star reviewer who said that the Beatles did not &quot;rock&quot; anymore until 1968. What do you call Taxman, She Said She Said, Day Tripper, And My Bird Can Sing, Doctor Robert, Tomorrow Never Knows, PaperBack Writer, Rain, Sgt Pepper Title track/Reprise, Getting Better? Amazing how ignorant some people are!<br />On to Rubber Soul, so many innovations. First, the trend-setting pre-1967 psychedlic album cover. Second, use of sitar on Norweigan wood. New recording techniques(over-dubbing of instrumental parts). Introspective lyrics(Nowhere Man, Think For Yourself, The Word, Girl, In My Life). Witty(Drive My Car, Norweigan Wood, I'm Looking Through You, Run For You Life). Macca's most beautiful love song to date - Michelle. Guitar innovation - If I needed someone.<br />The only thing that prevents this from being the absolute top album in the Beatles canon are the standard pop fare - You Wont See Me, Wait.<br />Regardless of that little weakness, Rubber Soul has a prominent place in my listening queue.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The beginning scene of `The Matrix Reloaded' is a torrent of falling code: representational symbols trickling down from a higher `source' to the innumerable mediaverse-enslaved masses below.  Then the code shifts, spinning out like shards of random meme-generated illusion, and images emerge from the code: a nebula spreading out in full aeon-swirl glory; kanji-esque icons rotating in mechanical precision; and finally, the gears and numerical impression (04...05...06) of a desk-clock striking the midnight mark.  The movie itself then unfolds before the viewer in a way quite similar to the fleeting seconds of this opening scrawl: the Matrix Reloaded is a clockwork onion, with more and more layers stripping away as one makes a (conscious) effort to penetrate the surface-glare of CGI, the onslaught of physics-mandated impossibility, the kitchen sink approach to spectacle... with the visual-triggers stripped away, all that remains are the basic questions of human existence: what is truth? What is freedom...and control? How does one fight oppression and fashion a better tomorrow? This movie is _deep_, and IMO has more `testicular fortitude' than any mainstream offering from Hollywood since Fincher's necronerd epic `Fight Club.' <br />The story: the last human refuge, Zion, has grown too dangerous for the Matrix and its AI controllers, and an army of 250,000 sentinels have been sent to destroy the rebellious populace.  As Zion prepares for war, Neo, ultra-hacker and supposed savior of mankind, searches inside the Matrix labyrinth for the clues he needs to stop the attack.  Neo can fly, stop bullets, and even take on the replicating virus of his arch-nemesis Smith... but, without the knowledge of who he is and what the Matrix represents, even Neo, the post-modern superhero, is but a lost soul following crumbs in the woods; a tool utterly ignorant of his true purpose.  This concept sits rather uncomfortably with the average archetype-programmed fan (hence the numerous negative reviews on this page), but the tagline for this installment of the franchise is, after all, \\"free your mind.\\"<br />The spectacle: The first movie of this trilogy revolutionized special effects with its seamless \\"bullet-time\\" approach and won an Oscar for the effort.  Subsequently, these effects were copied and replicated to the point of parody: another notch on Baudrillard's walking-staff.  The visual effects team at ESC knew they had to go above and beyond, and boy did they ever, inventing a new technology dubbed \\"virtual camera\\" that, unfortunately, this DVD sheds very little light upon.  I suppose they don't want Bulletproof Monk 2 copying them so rapidly...or, more likely, they are saving the big documentaries for the inevitable box set.  <br />Let us take the much-maligned Smith fight for example.  People complain that it was \\"too long\\" and \\"too fake\\"...and upon the first viewing, I would be inclined to agree.  But multiple viewings have unveiled the CGI illusion and showed me the true nature of this fight, what is being presented: 1) a representation of a virus attacking the immune system...or a computer program. 2) a long, rather impressive martial arts display for Keanu Reeves, a man veering on the 40 year mark  3) the jaw-dropping technical feat of *not cutting away* once Neo gains the pole-this, virtual technology at its astounding inception, it makes me shake and tremble as to the implications of how this technology can be used in the future. And finally 4) a sly wink to an entire generation of video-game weaned youth, with the lone hero battling endless hordes of computer-generated enemies, and even slipping into a CGI caricature (deliberate? I think so) when the Matrix itself has difficulty processing The One's chaos-generating existence.<br />The philosophy: Granted, the circular, seemingly redundant dialogue; the geyser of questions asked and answers undelivered; and the five-minute meta-speak speech at the climax: the Matrix Reloaded tests the current mental climate of its mass audience, and the reaction from some quarters has been quite loud, incredibly reactionary, and sadly ignorant.  A five-minute search on Google will reveal, to the curious and open-minded, the religious significance of the names and imagery; the full meaning behind the Architect's impressive (and condescending) summation; even the intent behind the \\"rave\\" scene (why is it that the on-screen sex is condemned as \\"unnecessary\\" - this, the primal expression of human love! -  while the violence is damned as not \\"violent\\" enough?).  But a five-minute search is apparently too much trouble for some.  Their loss.<br />Some other random things I liked:<br />1) Smith's bible-referencing license plate on the Audi-quite appropriate, given the speculation of Revolutions. The crows at the courtyard are a nice touch, as well.<BR>2) The fact that the martial arts sequences utilize misdirection/redirection of energy instead of brute force and blood-splaying. <BR>3) The Merovingian.  Besides the implicative import of his name, Lambert Wilson gives an astonishing performance as the ultra-debauched Pluto figure, and he offsets Neo's ignorance and Morpheus' rigid drive nicely.<BR>4) The Freeway chase: even after watching it six + times, it still gets the juices flowing.  <BR>5) The deliberate manipulation of the camera to add layers of subtext to conversations: watch Neo and Smith's first verbal tête-à-tête carefully.  It took me four or five times to understand the (brilliant) usage...<BR>6) The total-cheese Neo/Trinity moment.  It shouldn't work, but the contrast of meta-speak/mass-destruction with the cliché makes me shed tears of joy.  I love this movie! *sniff*<BR>7) The choreography.  As a martial artist, I found the fights to be more involving and interesting the more I watched them; they are easily the most complicated sequences in a mainstream movie since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<BR>8) How elements from Matrix 1 corresponded with Reloaded: the Architect screens, the spoon-boy's five other spoons (on the ground, in M1), the \\"twist\\", several of the speeches. <br />I write this review a day before traveling to the theater for the conclusion to this sci-fi epic.  I know I won't be disappointed: all I expect are what the _creator's_ intended.  Given the intelligence and verve of Reloaded, I know it will be more than enough.
B00005JKC3|2.0|UGH, I'm pretty disappointed with this movie.  I'm pretty open-minded and always give a bad movie the benefit of the doubt.  The way they hyped up the hulk seemed like their target audience was kids and action buffs.  The trailers only showed action sequences (mind you if you've seen the trailer, that covers all the actions sequences in the movie) so I figured I knew what I was in for.  I rented this movie with the mindset of watching a fun action movie.... I got neither.  I would say it was a movies for intellectuals, but it's not that either because of the convoluted story line, a 2 year old could figure it out that the movie didn't make sense.  As for the story line, they had so many avenues which to expand upon and yet they barely touch on each and leave you utterly frustrated because they don't fully commit to any.  Just know this, the trailer is very misleading and it does not represent what the movie is about.  I think even the producers don't know what this movie is about. They tried to make it everything and came out with nothing.  None of the characters are built up well, for example many of the actions driving his dad's character don't fit with his person, in a sense of being contradictory to his personality, you find yourself saying things like, \\"whoa, where did that come from?\\"  Honestly if you watch this movie with the expectations of Spiderman or any of the Xmen movies, you will be sorely disappointed.  Those movies had solid story lines and excellent character development with out being overly complicated.  Go to this movie expecting something like A Thin Red Line and you'll be alright, both movies move in the same snails pace with way too much thought put into every sentence that is spoken.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I was really looking forward to this CD based on Surfacing and Fumbling, and bought it without hearing even one song off of it. Unfortunately this is a completely forgettable album. Every track sounds the same, there's no catchy arrangements, no variety, nothing to remember. He lyrics are right there, but the arrangements and production hides them behind banality.<br />Sorry Sarah....<br />KAC
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|My two cents' worth is that this collection does render the old Shaking the Tree CD unnecessary, and it does add a few things.  As has been noted, there are two tracks from the import-only OVO CD.  There are also two unreleased tracks.  They're pretty good -- the new studio cut, &quot;Burn You Up&quot; has a funky-heavy vibe.  The &quot;Hits&quot; and &quot;Misses&quot; concept has been done before (Joni Mitchell, 1996), but the selection on the 2nd disc is still interesting.<br />As sometimes happens to me with these kinds of career-spanning anthologies, hearing these songs anew allowed me to notice and admire them.  For example, on &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; I was impressed by the pristine quality of Kate Bush's duet vocal and enjoyed the lush, moody coda at the song's end.  There's the ingenious little bridge in the middle of &quot;Big Time&quot; (brief, pontifical).  And so on.<br />One other thing -- the sound on my copy is rather harsh and tinny, which is disappointing.  I tried it on two stereos plus my computer and experienced the same situation each time.
B000008H1U|5.0|This is among my favorite Jethro Tull CDs.  &quot;Jump Start&quot; is my favorite song on the album.  But, &quot;Mountain Men,&quot; &quot;Dogs in the Midwinter,&quot; &quot;Steel Monkey&quot; and &quot;Budapest&quot; are also fun to listen to.  The other four songs are entertaining and there's no need to hit the &quot;skip&quot; button on the CD player.  Did it deserve the award for &quot;Best Heavy Metal Album?&quot;  No.  But, they could have simply removed &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; from the award and it would have been well deserved.
B0000B3B95|2.0|Boring boring boring movie. <BR>Some half way decent special effects
B00005JM02|5.0|My 22 month old son loved this movie.  He was mesmerized by the colors and characters.  I never thought he would sit through a full movie, but he did.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Even my husband and I really enjoyed it.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Chris Lee has had a love-hate relationship with Dracula.  He played him in a series of films (progressively WORSE) for Hammer Films, and was often very vocal because the works got farther and farther from Stoker's story.  He did a Spanish version where he starts out with grey hair and moustache, and he felt it was a more faithful adaption.  Interesting, but it really does not hold a candle to this first outing.  The poor lensing and production quality was a stake to the heart to the Spanish version.<br />Hammers production is lush in quality and colour, with the powerful, aristocrat Count (Lee) meeting Harker in his castle in Transylvania, then later flees to England to stalk Harker fianc&eacute;.  Only, in seducing Mina and Lucy, he comes up against a formidable foe Van Helsing, wonderfully played by the late great Peter Cushing (the second pairing for the duo, the first Hammer's Frankenstein).  They were super in their struggle, climaxing in their battle of good against evil swashbuckle style.<br />Lee was dynamically menacing, with courtly European grace and manners, and turned on the sensual magic that saw him soon recognised as a star world wide.  The best of the Hammer Vampires, and despites Lee's often dismissal of the films and others for Hammers, it stands as a brilliant work.<br />At this price, it's a super bargain!
B000002J3W|4.0|but not many albums are.  Better than their debut album...which was solid.  Only GREAT song on here is Beat Yourself Blind...but this album is rock solid pretty much throughout.  Other standout tracks include...My Enemy, Frozen, Breakin Down
B0000DBJDM|2.0|20 bucks, there had to be a catch.......    4% PAL to NTSC speed up .... ridiculous (not neccessarily chipmunk floyd but extremely annoying to any one sensitive to pitch and tempo......better than the vhs only in the sense, that it won't wear out thru multiple viewings, and the mix is  certainly better..........i guess remixing the music from the original multitracks and transfering at the CORRECT speed (for NTSC ) was too much....... trouble ?      bottom line.   Floyd deserve to be remembered better than this.......<br />buyer beware !
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan gracefully returns after nearly 5 or 6 years absence with &quot;Afterglow&quot;.  I've been a long-time fan of Sarah's music but I did not really love &quot;Surfacing&quot; as an entire album.  There are no surprises on &quot;Afterglow&quot;, just classic Sarah.  Vocally and musically, Sarah is at peak form on all the songs.  There are no weak songs on this CD.  You can easily listen through the entire album without skipping any tracks.  There are no jarring tracks, so there is great flow through the entire CD.  I've read some reviews that criticized &quot;Afterglow&quot; for lacking variety and being too mellow.  However, I found the consistency through the album to be a strong point.  I also think that some listeners (who do not listen carefully) misunderstand the peace, calm, tranquil confidence that Sarah exudes for being too mellow, disinterested, or lacking passion.  Anyone who begs to differ should listen carefully to &quot;Stupid&quot; where Sarah's vocals convey fiery passion and sorrow.  The instrumentals and vocal arrangements are superb, as usual, throughout the CD.  Even when Sarah is not at her best, she is still better than most of the rest.  &quot;Afterglow&quot; is the &quot;answer&quot; that her audience has been waiting for during her respite.  With heavenly and soulful whispers, Sarah's &quot;answer&quot; resounds clearly and loudly that she continues to &quot;burn bright&quot;.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Maybe the first two where so good that expectations where just to high, but Revolutions definetly did not satisfy!  Too much action, little depth.  Hopefully the Wachowski Bros. will leave it at that and cut our losses.  Some good scenes but generally not as good as the first two.  See it, but you won't love it!
0385504209|5.0|First of all, let me say GREAT BOOK! I could never imagine finding such a great novel to read in my spare time. It was full of intrigue, and mystery. Something that we all must agree, is hard to find these days. It creates a different point of view within the reader. It opens your mind. No longer will you look at religion the same way. However, only read this if your faith is firmly grounded. It really does make think and wonder about the truth of religion, more specifically,  Christianity. The codes within the book, dealing with DaVinci and the arts, are that, that give the book its title. These codes and theories are some that give the plot such depth and understanding. Its definitly a reading for those that enjoy a reading on a higher level, one that transcends all tradition. READ IT!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is by far my favorite CD to have with me while I'm driving.  The songs change seamlessly and the music flows beautifully - really helps to take one's mind off the daily commute!  However, what really sold me on this music is track 14 - about 3 minutes in.  Literally every time I listen to this part, I get chills.  And I've listened to this CD countless times since I bought it 2 months ago.  Klaus Badelt did a terrific job with this one &amp; I highly recommend this work!!
B00008J4P5|2.0|This album sucks. <BR>This band is overhyped.<BR>So what if they did the entire album on old equipment. <BR>Did they push the recording beyond any album that had been done in the 60's or 70's? <BR>C'mon &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;<br />IT IS A GIMMICK!!
B00000G3I2|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over, especially the less stressful parts. To me, this movie has that in common with \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\": it's one of those movies you can just enjoy painlessly.<BR>What a relief it is to see Glenn Close behaving like a 100% normal person for once! I think all of the actors behave differently here than in any other film in their careers. They're almost unrecognizable. It's like you are actually spending time with them, not watching them \\"work.\\"<br />The soundtrack is great, the story is just superb, well told, well acted, impeccable timing.<BR>And watching that young girl stretching her legs almost all the way behind her head, like it's effortless has always made me green with envy.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Excellent, excellent DVD. Say what you will about the update on quality, i think they did a great job. Moreover, this is perhaps the most well-acted film I've ever seen. Tony Montana is the first role that comes to mind when I think of Al Pacino, probably because he does such a damn good job playing a crazy drugged up gangster.
B000002H97|4.0|If you are a big Metallica fan, buy it! If you ar not, nuy it anyway! With a well timed mix of ballads such as &quot;unforgiven&quot; and heavy hits like &quot;enter sandman&quot;, this album caters to all listeners. Though the BLACK album did not sound like the metallica of &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; or &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, I would still recomend it for all listeners.
B000001DTM|5.0|What hasn't been said about U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" all ready?  Not much.<br /><br />  I first listened to Achtung Baby when I asked my dad if I could borrow U2 CD's from him a little over a year ago now; they have become one of my favorite band since then.  When I first heard Achtung Baby, however, I found it unlistenable, with the exception of two tracks: One and Mysterious Ways. I listened to it at least 10x's, and I still didn't like it; I just couldn't get into it at all.<br /><br />  Then I told my mother to buy me U2 CD's and gave her a list of the ones I wanted and she just happened buy me Achtung Baby, at the time I was 17yrs and I was really stressed out, and I'd overplayed Joshua Tree after listening to it about 100x's before popping this one in this time.<br /><br />  I still didn't really like it a whole lot at first, but I kept listening to it hoping it would grow on me, and the more I listened the more I liked it, until finally I loved the entire album. This album has a lot of rewards, and it has gotten me through a lot of tough times of depression and stress.<br /><br />  This CD is the peak for U2 I think in terms of creativity and emotional honesty. Here, unlike in the past where the lyrics are extremely straight-forward, they are  very metaphorical.  Along with the complex music this makes for a more rewarding album then Joshua Tree over the long-term,although they are equally great albums for different reasons.<br /><br />  My favorite songs at the moment are: Ultra Violet Light, The Fly, One, Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World, So Cruel, End of the World.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
B00000HYXB|5.0|There is only one album from Blind Guardian that comes close to this, and that is &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot;.  Buy this album now, before you are doomed to a life of horrible music otherwise.
6301966562|4.0|I never forgot this movie I saw when I was still a child (I was Born in 1973). The music duet between Virginia Madsen (she's in Dune as well) and the computer is one of the greatest music moments of my life. I never saw it again on television (why not? After all, at least the theme song Electric Dreams was a very big hit - I just couldn't get enough of listening to it at the time).<BR>I must say when I saw it that I thought the girl was too good for the guy and that the computer must have been a not too distant relative of 2001's psychopathic Hall-2000. But even the computer is a sort of Romeo-like tragic lover, much more romantic than the leading man.<BR>I loved the fact that in the movie liquids like champagne and tears have magical powers to bring inanimate, cold technology to life and love. It didn't seem cheesy to me. It still doesn't.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi made me laugh out loud. It also made me cry towards the end. Starts out really lighthearted and humorous. Then gets kinda into a religion phase that sorta makes you think &quot;uh oh...not another one of these!&quot;. Then It gets fascinating with a story of amazing survival. The end is a well rounded gut splitting finish that had me laughing and tearing up at the same time. I want everyone to read this book.
B00004XONN|5.0|Simply put this cd is beyond amazing.The most groundbreaking record of this generation.The music on this album can make you feel emotional extremes.The song idioteque is the most haunting, creepy song I have ever heard and the title track almost brings me to tears. Buy this cd immediately and if you dont like it on the first listen dont give up, youll grow to love it no matter what.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This film works because the actors are able to play eachother convincingly and to humourous ends. A fine film to watch with your kids (and there are not many like that lately). The best thing about this film is that is fosters an understanding of other people, while being very entertaining and funny.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Wow. It's so refreshing to hear Sarah's wonderful voice again. In a time full of TRL garbage, we were in need of somebody with real, raw, beautiful talent. <BR>Her voice and lyrics make me feel so good.  <br />&quot;Would your eyes like midnight fireflies/ light up the trenches where my heart lies/ until i can see again/ to find my way back again&quot; - Train Wreck<br />Push is a beautiful song.&quot;And when I fall you offer me a safer place to land&quot;<br />Thank You Sarah!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The Strokes are not the saviors of rock and roll. But they are a good band, just a bunch of New York City hipsters playing cranked up, very New York City rock; that's enough. Give them some slack, eh, critics? It must be hard to be labeled as the musical equivalent of Jesus.<BR>On the Strokes' second album, Room on Fire, the band follows closely to the template it set out in its first record, Is This It? That is, punky pop tempered with serious worship of the New York underground rockers of the past. <BR>Singer/songwriter Julian Casablancas seems to have taken vocal lessons from the king of New York junkie rock himself, Lou Reed, and the chiming, clean twin guitars recall the less bombastic moments of CBGB punk darlings Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd of Television.<BR>Same as it ever was for the Strokes. But this time they add a keyboard, most notably the album's single, \\"12:51,\\" with a sing-songy synth line that recalls Weezer more than Suicide.<BR>While Room on Fire peters out a bit toward the end with some filler tracks, the opening salvo of the first five or so songs is a fine example of why the band has become so popular; it's hit after mopey, drunken - and catchy -- hit.<BR>They have been called the group that spearheaded the neo-garage rock movement, with loud, simple, Stooges-inspired bands like the White Stripes riding on their coattails. <BR>But there is more of an indie-pop sensibility to the Strokes, less crash and bash and more sharp, stinging single notes. They have a good formula, but it's too obvious that they are following in the footsteps of true innovators. It's not necessarily a bad thing - it sounds good most of the time, but the Strokes have a long way to go before they truly earn the right to be drooled over by critics the way they are today.
B00005JMFR|1.0|I have no idea what the Wachowski brothers were thinking when they imagined the resolution of the Matrix trilogy, but this is a joke. I was hoping for something on the order of Testuo in Akira, or Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. But this?<br />Visually, the moive is absolutely amazing. The battle for Zion is spectacular and the final Smith vs. Neo fight was amazing. But the first Matrix movie didn't make millions because of fight sequences, but because of the thought-provoking theory of the Matrix.<br />The purpose of these two films was to introduce and resolve the real story of the Matrix. I enjoyed the story from Enter the Matrix (the video game) better than this. That story kept me begging for more. This story leaves me begging for more too: two more writers to write a sensible screenplay.
B000003TA4|1.0|Why do you like this album... , really?<br />Do you like this album because of the MUSIC?<br />Or do you like this album because it makes every top 100 best-album list?<br />Because its praised by MTV? the same people who have specials on bands like Good Charlotte &amp; that run TRL?<br />Because if you honestly like this album because of the music, &amp; dont care about its pop culture reference, (which shouldnt even matter)<br />I got news for you, there have been 1000's of better albums made<br />I dont care what VH1 tells me, i care about what my ears tell me, &amp; what they tell me is, this album isnt even close to being one of the best ive heard in my life<br />im 35, have heard over 2000 albums by 500 different bands... i know what im talking about<br />You might be thinking, (&quot;35? psh, this guys just some old geezer, what would HE know about this generation x type music?&quot; well, keep in mind, i was 22 when this album came out, didnt care for it then, dont care for it now)<br />Every other huge 90s band at the time was much better... start with Pearl Jam at the top, who i believe, is the greatest band ever

Dont look to this book if you're in search of something. It can do NOTHIN for you! Go cop a copy of the greatest book around- the Bible! :)
0767002652|5.0|I now own the entire series - absolutely fabulous portrayal of an intriguing era of history. The snobbishness of the 'lower'classes is brilliantly portrayed by the servants of Eaton Place. Even better, the 'real' events of the period and the effects are excellently covered.
B000002KIK|5.0|I know every Sabbath album by heart and this one is VERY GOOD!!The first 3 songs of this album are as good as Sabbath gets!<BR>Never Say Die is fast paced song that energizes you...Johnnie Blade may be the THE BEST song they ever recorded with AWESOME rowdy lyrics...Ozzie's on fire... Juniors Eyes is a chilling song with awesome changes. This is WAY underrated...right up there with Sabotage as one of their best albums. Only TRUE Black Sabbath fans are aware of this awesome album.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This is the greatest album ever made, dont care a damn about what you think<br />This is when you click &quot;NO&quot; on whether or not this review is helpful, because its not your favorite album of all time, &amp; its your only way to disagree<br />Doesnt matter, its still the greatest album of all time, i dont care about whether or not YOU think it is, im just stating a FACT.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I have been waiting for Sarah McLachlan to come back for so long.  This is a good album, but the emotions are not as raw as we saw in FTE (her best album, IMHO).  She doesn't sing about the loss of her mother or birth of her daughter on this album, surprisingly.  Still, her voice is hypnotizing and the lyrics are great.  Best songs - Push, Traing Wreck, Fallen, and Stupid. This is a definite buy!
B00005Q45W|5.0|I have only recently been exposed to Leonard Cohen, and this is the first album in full of his that I have ever listened to...and repeatedly at that. <BR>I had always felt he had a rather boring voice---Perry Como with poetry...before I really listened to him. From the funky groove of \\"boogie street\\" with the lyric \\"so my friends, be not afraid, we are so lightly here. it's not in love that we are made, in love we disappear.\\" OMG! <BR>The prequel, if you will, is \\"A thousand kisses deep\\" about a man exploring his life...a little sedate-but more like a very sexy man whispering in your ear confiding in you about his life---men may not get the appeal--but women will.  <BR>\\"Here it is\\" has a reggae groove and lyrics that I don't think I fully understand...but it works--it has a sexy slinky beat. While the lyrics of \\"Alexandra Leaving\\" are haunting and sad, the execution doesn't really work--a little too spare for me. And \\"In my secret life\\" is also very good.  \\"You have loved enough\\" builds to a passionate slow dance of song. \\"By the rivers dark\\" is a like a ritual ceremony, set to a tribal beat---about a part of a mans spiritual journey-- a man being struck by experience and plunged into awareness of his dark side. <BR>6 totally great tracks, 2 not bad, 1, I didn't care for.   <br />Until I read the others reviews, I hadn't even noticed the synth background. And while I think it would have been much better with real music...I am surprised I hadn't noticed it--normally I really hate it.  <BR>This is so well executed, the harmonies, melodies, lyrics--and compositions are, while not using great instruments, so beautifully composed---it can be totally forgiven. It certainly helps feature his beautiful lyrics and both his and Sharon Robinson's voices perfectly...which in some cases are so exquisitely beautiful that you just shake your head--harmonies where neither are actually singing the melody but the both of them together create the melody---really beautiful.<br />Overall, this is a great album and I am here right now looking for more Leonard Cohen to buy....thought I would stop by and share.
0689859368|5.0|I am 7 years old and it was so good that I read it in 2 days. It was scary, adventurous, exciting, and it really intrigued me. I can't wait to read all the rest of the books.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Let me get this straight: after five years of silence, we get this particular forty minutes of music and are expected to pay album price for it?<br />Of course, many of us will -- including me, since I liked \\"Touch\\" and \\"Solace,\\" loved \\"Fumbling,\\" and was willing to forgive the relative lack of value that \\"Surfacing\\" delivered.  This makes two strikes, though, and it's enough for this particular fan to give up on this particular artist.<br />Let's face it, folks.  Sarah McLachlan is not a punk artist who can deliver in forty minutes what, say, Sleater-Kinney can.  Nor is she among the gifted few -- Peter Gabriel comes to mind -- who can get away with delivering a paltry eight minutes of music per year because the music is simply that good.  At this point, the best she can offer is to sing you reliably to sleep, with visions of sugarplums and gratuitous stringed instruments.  (Granted, you may be forced to wake up momentarily for \\"Stupid,\\" which I will admit is a very good song).<br />Buy it if you like.  You could do worse.  But to buy it without also buying _Scarlet's Walk_ by Tori Amos, or _Waking Hour_ by Vienna Teng, or at least one of the other astonishing releases from female singer-songwriters that simply put this one to shame?  Now that's just wrong.
B00005JMFR|2.0|What happened to the amazing creativity of the Wachowski brothers? Even knowing it was a sequel I hoped for better. The holes in the dialog were filled in with cursing, the holes in the plot were filled in with explosions and when they couldn't come up with a good twist for the end they stole from Frank Herbert.<br />If it wasn't for the few great scenes that Trinity, Niobe, and Z get I would be disapointed beyond belief. There was about 30 minutes of film that deserved four stars and the rest didn't deserve even 1. I just keep thinking I went to a theatre as dawn for this!<br />Yet somehow even though I'm telling everyone I know it was hideous I've got to see it again. Maybe because the soundtrack broke and I was lip reading for the last ten minutes. Sigh.

078681859X|5.0|\\"The temperature of the room dropped fast. Ice formed on the curtains and crusted thickly around the lights in the ceiling. The glowing filaments in each bulb shrank and dimmed, while the candles that sprang from every available surface like a colony of toadstools had their wicks snuffed out. The darkened room filled with a yellow, choking cloud of brimstone, in which indistinct black shadows writhed and roiled. From far away came the sound of many voices screaming. Pressure was suddenly applied to the door that led to the landing. It bulged inward, the timbers groaning. Footsteps from invisible feet came pattering across the floorboards and invisible mouths whispered wicked things from behind the bed and under the desk.<br />\\"The sulfur cloud contracted into a thick column of smoke that vomited forth thin tendrils; they licked the air like tongues before withdrawing. The column hung above the middle of the pentacle, bubbling ever upward against the ceiling like the cloud of an erupting volcano. There was a barely perceptible pause. Then two yellow staring eyes materialized in the heart of the smoke.<br />\\"Hey, it was his first time. I wanted to scare him.\\"<br />Meet Bartimaeus, a powerful djinni who is capable of adopting thousands of visible guises, observing things on seven different planes, and who enjoys dropping the names of (and telling anecdotes about) the famous people he has served over the course of many millennia. He is the title character of a new trilogy being written by British author Jonathan Stroud.<br />Bartimaeus has been summoned by Nathaniel, a somewhat slight twelve-year-old who was sold at a tender age into a magician's apprenticeship. Nathaniel has been raised by that clueless and mediocre magician, Arthur Underwood, who serves in the British government's Ministry of Internal Affairs, and by Underwood's wife, who is loving and maternal toward the apprentice, while seemingly quite blind to her husband's shortcomings--particularly his harsh manner of relationship with the boy.<br />Having been summoned by Nathaniel, Bartimaeus waits for his orders:<br />\\"The kid cleared his throat. This was the moment. This was what he'd been building up to. He'd been dreaming of this for years, when he should have been lying on his bed thinking about racing cars or girls. I waited grimly for the request. What would it be? Levitating some object was a usual one, or moving it from one side of the room to the other. Perhaps he'd want me to conjure an illusion. That might be fun: there was bound to be a way of misinterpreting his request and upsetting him.<br />\\" 'I charge you to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand from the house of Simon Lovelace and bring it to me when I summon you at dawn tomorrow.'<br />\\" 'You what?'<br />\\" 'I charge you to retrieve--'<br />\\" 'Yes, I heard what you said.' I didn't mean to sound petulant. It just slipped out, and my sepulchral tones slipped a bit too.\\"<br />At first underestimating the boy--as so many characters do throughout the book--Bartimaeus assumes Nathaniel is being manipulated by some \\"real\\" magician to snatch the powerful charm. But unknown to all, Nathaniel is a brilliant apprentice with a razor sharp memory who has self-taught himself by devouring book after book in his master's library. Underwood's continuing attitude--that Nathaniel is worthless and untrainable--fuels the boy's quiet and tenacious determination to develop himself into an exceptional magician and eventually fulfill his aspirations of growing up to serve in Parliament.<br />Bartimaeus has been summoned by the boy because Nathaniel is also determined to take revenge for the humiliating fashion in which he has been treated in the past by a group of Underwood's cohorts, led by the power-hungry Lovelace. It turns out that Simon Lovelace has acquired the Amulet in question through a deadly scheme. When Bartimaeus obeys his young master command and succeeds in gaining the Amulet, Lovelace is willing to do anything necessary to insure the charm's return.<br />The unusual relationship that develops between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel winds its way through the 460 pages of this wild, action-filled tale. That relationship is both adversarial and interdependent, and involves gradually increasing levels of mutual respect.<br />And, as you might have inferred, Bartimaeus has quite a wit. The author utilizes frequent footnotes to allow the djinni to provide explanations and historic tidbits, as well as share his many sarcastic asides (&agrave; la Groucho Marx).<br />Jonathan Stroud, who, like his character, lives amid the outskirts of London, is currently balancing obligations to promote this first book with the need to keep an eye on his approaching January deadline for submitting the second manuscript. Miramax has spent a substantial sum for the movie rights to the trilogy, and after devouring the first book, it sure seems like a great investment.<br />\\"The first grudging rays flickered in the eastern sky. A halo of light slowly emerged over the Docklands horizon. I cheered it on. It couldn't come fast enough.<br />\\"The whole night had been a wearisome and often humiliating business. I had repeatedly lurked, loitered, and fled, in that order, through half the postal districts of London. I had been manhandled by a thirteen-year-old girl. I had taken shelter in a bin. And now, to cap it all, I was crouching on the roof of Westminister Abbey, pretending to be a gargoyle. Things don't get much worse than that.\\"<br />I carried this book around the show with me all weekend, taking full advantage of any and all free moments to read another chapter of our heroes matching wits, wills, imps, and illusions against the bad guys. Oftentimes, traipsing through Stroud's complicated world, I was in total awe: It was like watching someone use a truckload of paper clips to build a life-size model of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and you're just waiting for it to fall apart--but it all just keeps holding together...like magic.<br />Richie Partingtono insure the charm's return. <br />The unusual relationship that develops between Bartimaeus and Nathaniel winds its way through the 460 pages of this wild, action-filled tale.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|&quot;Afterglow&quot; is a short collection of songs (barely over 40 minutes), that Sarah's been slowly working on them over the past 5 or 6 years. Unlike some of the other artists I follow, Sarah is not one to release a lot of b-side material. She seems to choose her favorites, then commits to their careful development. This new release is short, but every note has been closely considered.<br />I've heard &quot;Afterglow&quot; three or four times now and I have to say that I really, really enjoy it. It's nothing new musically, but given the fluff that dominates mainstream pop music, it's refreshing to hear something that sounds like it had some effort put into it . It's mature, and it's definitely timeless. It's been ten years (?!?) since she entered the public's consciousness with &quot;Fumbling Toward Ecstasy&quot;, an album that still manages to feel fresh. This new collection isn't as exciting or complex (mainly because we're now familiar with the &quot;Sarah sound&quot;), but it'll still enjoy a long and healthy shelf life. I think there'll be layers that reveal themselves with each listen. It's a very &quot;warm&quot; album, perfect for rainy days or quiet evenings at home.<br />There's one big change, though. She doesn't play a whole lot of guitar this time, instead taking on piano duties for most of the record. I'd imagine that the songs were written that way.<br />I'd also note that there are some interesting lyrical ideas about relationships - noteworthy when you consider that she went through the loss of her mother and the birth of her first child within months of each other.<br />It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's still nice to have a solid offering from a genuinely gifted and skilled artist. Nice that the album works on two levels: it's a great background CD but it's even better if you can give it time with headphones. :)<br />Tough to pick a favorite track at this point (because each song flows so well into the next), but I'd say that &quot;Answer&quot; and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; are standouts. &quot;World On Fire&quot; has a gentle groove, and might make for a great followup single to &quot;Fallen&quot;.

0345340426|5.0|The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a work of pure genius. Mr. Tolkien had a wonderful imagination.  He makes everything come alive, giving the feeling that this isn't fantasy but reality, which seems like it's some ancient history that has been long forgotten. This trilogy also gives readers the imagination to soar into worlds far away, dreams of heroes, conflict, beauty and grandeur.

B000000JO3|5.0|now see here... this is the one of the best albums you will ever hear, so do yourself a favor and buy it.  if you are however a fan of bands like good charlotte, sum41, blink 182 and such and think that the only good music is that which is shoved down your throat by MTV then stay away from this album.  You wouldn't understand what it is that makes a good album.  Just keep following MTV my little sheep.  Sorry, got sidetracked by another review i read.  Anyhow to sum up...<BR>good album, buy now, listen and enjoy.

0385504209|2.0|Reading this wasn't like getting root canal; it wasn't that painful,  Instead, reading it was like experiencing those moments in a dentist's chair with nothing to do except wait for the anaesthetic to seize hold, wait for the dentist to come in, wait with a cotton clump immobilizing your upper lip while a rubber device pries your jaw in place.  Your feeling is one of discomfort and boredom, and your dominant wish is simple:  \\"I hope this ends soon.\\"<br />As banal as some \\"page-turners\\" may be, this book seems uniquely joyless, without any of the elements that make books special, if not magical: insight, words that act like lyrics, passages that read almost musically.  Instead, this book seems frighteningly like the Dick and Jane books:it's not just storytelling, it's only storytelling.  Pure plot and nothing more.<br />Is that what fiction has come to?  Heaven help us!  And who has ten hours to waste on something like this, something that suggests what one reviewer said of the movie The Passenger: If sheer vacuity had weight, one could crush an ox by dropping on him this book.<br />Of course, this screed seems to assume this is a book.  In all likelihood, it isn't; it's the outline for a screen play from which Mr. Brown hoped and prayed  he reap at least $3 million so he could avoid the one task he dislikes: writing.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|This could be the sequel of mama's gun, speaking about the sonority of the record, the lirycs are quite simple but are ok in the contest of the song they keep the groove alive.... who say<BR>that a song MUST have great lyrics? the voice is an instrument, so it must be in harmony  with the other instruments, if you have something to say well say it, if not also some simple lyrics can do theyr work. The songs are quite long but it's a pleasure to listen to that jam like form of song, it's unusual on a record, but the jams here are chillin' and groovy (this is what i expect from a record like this...) i'm enjoing this cd right now while i'm workin' and it's good.... it puts me in a good mood. i think it's a record that will not disappoint who has an open mind about music and don't expect necessarily to listen something revolutionary... it's a record like many and better than others (not a must have but a nice one)
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes are amazing. I loved Is This It so much and I prepared myself for the biggest let down possible with Room On Fire. I shouldn't have doubted them. It's too early for me to say if this album is better, as Is This It has been in my rotation ever since its 2001 release. But Room On Fire is certainly just as good and certainly a step forward for them musically. <BR>For my money, Julian Casablancas is the best songwriter around right now. He just gets it and it doesn't ever seem like he is trying to hard, although I know he must be. This record is lo-fi as hell, but it sounds like the band was meticulous in trying to make the music a pure orgasm for your ears. The lyrics are amazing here. One of the reasons I love this band is cause Julian's lyrics speak to me like no one else's now. Julian's voice hasn't improved exactly but that's cause I thought it was great the first time around. He may not be an extraordinary singer, but he is always right there with the band and his vocal melodies are a huge part of The Strokes. The songs are all good, with standouts being Between Love &amp; Hate (next single, no doubt), Automatic Stop, Under Control and Reptilia.
B0000DJZBA|1.0|I was very excited when I heard that the whole video collection of my favorite band was going to be released on DVD. I've been waiting for this for a long time.<br />I finally received the disc a couple of days ago, but oh, what a disappointment! The sound is just horrible, unbearable.<br />The sound is too harsh, contains a lot of treble, it seems like it's over-compressed or something, and then they have raised the high frequencies. At Patience, the whistling is scratchy and noisy, and after that I couldn't watch it no more. I've asked to return this.

B00000IMTF|5.0|really the only thing i can do is repeat what other reviewers have been saying about this classic album,everysong here is a classic truly not one weak track.light in the black is the most underrated hard rock/metal song ever,it ranks right up there with sabbath's paranoid and purples smoke on the water.other standout tracks are tarot woman and stargazer.this is an unbelievable album all fans of metal should own.if you don't own this ,then you are really missing out on some great music.the only complaint that i have is that there was'nt enough songs,the cd could have used another 3 or 4 tracks.
B000002UB3|5.0|Unless you lived through it, the intensity of Beatlemania is hard to imagine. With all the hype, the sheer excellence of their musicianship is often overlooked. On 'Abbey Road', the quality of the work is stupendous.  It's a sad album because one can sense that the dream is starting to unravel. But any time you play it, you'll be reminded that the Beatles were truly great.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I'm a hardcore fan.  Period.  When I woke up this morning to see the end of the trilogy that has changed the cinema as we know it, I did not expect to become disapointed.<br />This installment does nothing but dodge around the meaning of the sequels.   I thought that they were there to show how humans would put an end to the machine world and become the dominant beings.  Yet instead you leave the theater with an empty feeling.  Very empty as the film takes the lives of those who matter the most in the fight for freedom.<br />Freedom will not be found if that is what you are looking for.  Instead this franchinse takes nothing from the viewer but their money, perhaps setting up another few Matrix films....<br />I'm still in awe.  What went wrong?!!!
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|First of all, 'Hit' is a better overall compilation than 'Sixteen Golden Greats', the former of which came out before the excellent records 'Us' (1992) and 'Up' (2002).  Given the comparable pricing, 29 songs is much better than 16, and both disks have a 76-minute running order.<br />The buyer should note that there is a U.K. version of this record which has song choice differences on Disk 2.  Although the U.K. version has one more song in total, the casual fan would probably prefer the U.S. version since it has the super-hit &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; - a disappointing exclusion from PG's first compilation.  (NOTE:  The other U.S.-only cuts are &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; and &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; from PG#3 (1980) and &quot;Love to be Loved&quot; from 'Us' (1992), while the U.K.-only cuts are &quot;No Self Control&quot; from PG#3, &quot;I Have the Touch&quot; from 'Security' (1982), &quot;Different Drum&quot; from 'Passion' (1989), and &quot;Washing of the Water&quot; from 'Us'.<br />Serious PG completists should want to buy either of the versions of this collection for two reasons:  (1) the new song, &quot;Burn You Up, Burn You Down&quot;; (2)  the track, &quot;Lovetown&quot;, previously only available on the 'Philadelphia' soundtrack (1994); and (3) the recently recorded live version of &quot;Downside, Up&quot; with vocals by PG's daughter.<br />As a serious PG fan, I consider 'Hit' to be a worthy compilation.  Reasonable minds who are hardcore PG fans may take minor issue with song choices - with the inclusion of three songs from 'Ovo' (2000) at the expense of PG's first two records may be the most obvious criticism (to me, &quot;The Tower That Ate People&quot; and &quot;Downside, Up&quot; could have been left off for &quot;Humdrum&quot; and &quot;Mother of Violence&quot;).  To me, the remix/dub choices were a little misguided - e.g., there was sufficient time to include the full version of &quot;Growing Up&quot; and &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; on Disk 1, andthe single edit of &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; would have made room for another tune on Disk 2.  I was also a bit disappointed with the liner notes, which are lacking in both volume and content (e.g., &quot;Steam&quot; is listed as an &quot;Radio Edit&quot; when in fact it is the full version; PG's fourth record is listed a &quot;PG#IV&quot; on one description and as &quot;Security&quot; on another).
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Maybe one of the best Christmas Albums of all time.  Christina Aguilera lets her voice shine without any limit or hesitation as she puts her magic touch on some Christmas Classics and some new Christmas Songs as well - This was beautifully done and is brillant from beginning to end. This is a must have for the holiday season collection.
0385504209|5.0|....you will find that Dan Brown's &quot;DaVinci Code&quot; is brilliant. It weaves a wealth of facts and non-facts into a great fictional mystery novel. This is one of the few books I have ever seen with such an unusual presentation. But, if you allow me to say so, if you really do put great stock in creative presentations, you would probably also like Norman Thomas Remick's highly creative &quot;West Point...Thomas Jefferson&quot;. I certainly recommend Dan Brown's bestselling &quot;DaVinci Code&quot; (and also the less known Remick book).
B0000CEB4V|5.0|this film is a contender to unthrone \\"the last waltz\\" or \\"stop making sense\\" as the best concert film ever.<BR>also is the closest  one will ever see to a Beatles reunion<BR>Mc Cartney- Ringo Starr-Jeff Lynn and Clapton all on stage togehert
B0000AXE8I|4.0|First of all, this was basically a 5-star film to me.  The 4 stars I have assigned in this review indicate my dissatisfaction with the lack of certain DVD features, and one other thing.<BR>But before we get to that:<BR>I'd like to address the many reviews on here in which the reviewer says that the movie &quot;wasted two hours of their life&quot; or something to that effect.  Look, if the stakes are that high for you, DON'T WATCH MOVIES.  I'm sick and tired of people acting like they've been physically assaulted if they didn't like a movie.  In many cases these are the same people who repeatedly destroy relationships for the same reason - they didn't get exactly what they wanted, so that means the other person &quot;wasted their time&quot;.  Whatever.  <BR>The DVD lacks features it should have had.  Early press indicated it would include deleted scenes...no such luck.  No commentary at all, and no music-only track as in the first film.  Not to mention useless Animatrix and Enter the Matrix previews that we have SEEN BEFORE and don't care about at this point, those bridges having been crossed already (maybe).<BR>Here's the other problem I have with the movie.  It's apparent that the W's have responded to complaints by ADD kids unable to follow the first film by COLOR-CODING this one.  A stomach-churning green color-overlay effect has been applied to the Matrix scenes, so that it's painfully obvious when characters are in the Matrix and when they're not; by contrast, Zion and the &quot;real world&quot; are overly blue in color.  Now, this is consistent with the Final Flight of the Osiris, which is why I feel marginally OK with it.  But the green overlay is applied inconsistently! In the same sequence, some shots may be very green, while others seem to be colored more or less normally.<BR>One wonders: will there eventually be another edition of this film in which the green color is toned down?
B00004TH83|4.0|While Celine Dion was taking her break in 2000, Lara Fabian burst into the scene with her self titled album release.  Her unique voice is delicatley placed over several wonderful songs as she demands the audience to feel her emotion on ever track. Although her voice is similar to that of Celine Dion, Fabian seperates herself by co-writing 90% of the songs on this album giving it that extra special touch.  Although this album is mostly filled with ballads, it deserves a chance -
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Not being a Sarah McLachlan fan, except of her rare dance/DJ collaborations, I've been converted with this collection of beautiful, graceful, introspective and moving tracks. <BR>With a beautiful voice, interesting lyrics, and excellent composition, this is definitely one of the  best albums I have heard this year.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Director Peter Jackson must have some kind of PhD in moviemaking that few folks are even close to.   The way he is able to put this whole project (look at the bonus material on the DVD and you'll see what I mean) together into an incredible work of art is just beyond words.   The performances are out of this world, and as far as the ladies are concerned: some might say that the actor who plays Aragorn gives Brad Pitt a serious run for his money.  Then again, maybe not. Let's face it.... it's Brad we're talking about all of a sudden, not chopped liver.<br />I  do have some peeves that came out; maybe others of you have the same feeling:<BR>1) Elija Wood as Frodo &quot;The Dazed and Confused &quot; during most of the film does get a bit tired.  I realize the significance of hobbits in general (in Tolkien's world), but in this film he seems to detract from the story, not enhance it.<BR>2) How did Liv Tyler get third billing on the credits when she had maybe two and a half minutes of screen time?<br />Regardless, the direction, storyline, cinematography, costumes, effects, battle scenes, and set designs are so amazing.... Matrix Schmatrix.
B00005JM02|5.0|From the begining this movie was awesome. &quot;i'll name one Nemo, the rest will be names Marlon Jr.&quot; awesome....the special effects are beyond this world. In the part where Marlon and Dory are going through to the Austrailian Current and they meet up with Crush, the sea turtle....i was astounded to see the annimation and how it has eveolved scince the first Mickey Mouse cartoons to the Pixar/Disney colaberations. its sheerly amazeing. the content of this movie is awesome. its suppriseing to see that everyone is complaining about how violence in the movies are breaking up morals and ethics set in the homes, schools, and churches, yet, this movie is the highest grossing film of the &quot;summer of violence.&quot; quite a contridiction concidering this movie is rated G and its not just for 2-10 year ods....its for the whole family....this and Shrek are the only animated movies that my dad accually WANTS to wach. thats awesome! When i left the theater after seeing Finding Nemo in the theaters, me and a friend of mine went back to the box office and bought anothe ticket just because we loved that movie so much...nd it just-so-happens to be that we are the age demographic that says violence is bad....quite a contidiction....i love this movie and whom ever doesnt has lost all their child-like feelings inside and have became a cold-hearted person....i prey for them....this movie will be talked about for years to come, i guarentee it!
0385504209|4.0|Seth Franzman's statement:<br />In the end this book is a great fascinating tale of suspense, but it is a fictional book. Lots of people including ABC news have been duped into beleiving this book has 'truth' to it when it is based on NO EVIDENCE whatsoever. The bible and Josephus are the only documents that speak of the life of Jesus. In neither work is Mary magdelane spoken of as a wife of Jesus. In no place is mary magdelane not a prostitute. The bible is clear on this. If you dont beleive the biblet hats fine, but you cant just make up history whern no text or evidence exists.<br />Response:<br />1) There are many more documents that speak of the life of Jesus.  Since you mention Josephus, I assume you're also including documents outside what is considered Christian canon.<br />2) Mary Magdalene is *never* spoken of as a prostitute.  She had seven demons driven from her.  It was another Mary who was a prosititute.  It's church tradition that casts Magdalene in the role of a prostitute (the theory is that one of the Popes wanted to consolidate the Marys).  I challenge you to find one instance in which Mary Magdalene is called a prostitute.<br />My point is, before all these one star reviewers go around challenging the &quot;facts&quot; in this fictional book (should be a moot point, right?), perhaps they should check the facts themselves.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I don't need to say much abut this one, exsept everyone who still hasn't bought it or is new 2 rap this is a important record for your collection. 2 discs of mind blowing beats, flows, lyrics. Is has it all. No songs to skip, of course some songs are better than the other. No weak material here and that's unbelievable for being a double disc. This will go down as one the best records ever. If you want rap lyrics visit : [...]<BR>Definitely recommend this for the collection if you don't have it yet. Is has plenty of guest and much stuff you can't bump at a party, in your car, at your system wherever you want. If fits everywhere! Be sure to check out &quot;Ressurection&quot; the soundtrack when it drops. <BR>One.
B00004XONN|5.0|In plain words, KID A is an amazing album and a great continuation and a new beginning to Radiohead's career.  Every song has an amazing ability to truely impact its listeners.  Radiohead, in this album, keep writing beautiful songs; however, now they become even better, becoming an electronic odyessy through the &quot;mind&quot; of Radiohead.  From &quot;Kid A&quot;, the title track, to &quot;Optimistic&quot; to &quot;Idioteque&quot;, the recording further establishes the band's ascetic genius.  Finding beauty from the negative world around him, Thom Yorke writes from the heart as he, some feel, contemplates the futures of those ignored by society for whatever their flaws may be, while others &quot;chosen by nature&quot;, as Darwin might say, leave them behind and make the world exclusively their own.  In conclusion, KID A is a fanastic album worth buying.
B00005JMFO|3.0|\\"Love is everywhere. When the planes hit the twin towers, I'm sure none of the phone calls made were about hate.\\"   -\\"Love Actually\\" from Universal Pictures<br />This is how the producers of \\"Love Actually\\" attempt to validate their movie.  I was appalled when in the opening moments of the movie; Hugh Grant's character crassly utters this line.  Why would anyone assume that it would be okay to use the WTC tragedy in this manner?  I sat there, stunned in the dark, pulled back to reality.  My husband said, \\"I wish he hadn't said that.\\"  I agree, I think this line needs to be pulled from this movie.<br />It is up to you if you want to see this movie; the rest of it was a jump around, too many story lines, amusing fare.  I just want to forewarn as many people as possible because I was completely shocked.  No one should find themselves sitting in the darkened theater; a victim of Universal Pictures' bad judgment
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I have yet to see this on dvd, but I did see this on an IMAX, and I must say, it was glorious.  The first time I saw this, I was left with many questions, but now that I have seen it a second time, most of the questions were answered.  I will admit that the whole rave/sex scene was overly long, but necessary.<BR>I believe a lot of the people who disliked the movie most likely did not understand it.  For instance, my friend asked me how Agent Smith took control of that one dude's brain (the one laying next to Neo when the movie ends).  It's simple: when everyone enters The Matrix, they enter as thought patterns that are converted into computer code and vice versa.  Thus, when Agent Smith exited The Matrix (With that dude's body), he exited as computer code that was then converted into thought patterns.  Also, unlike most movies today, you have to actually listen and pay attention to what Neo and the Architect have to say to understand the plot.  I won't get into that whole scene but I will say it's not that hard to understand, but it's a lot of info to take in at once.  I'd say if you didn't understand this movie than you should see it again and I think you will have a much better of idea of what's going on.  Also some say that the machines would not use humans for power, for there is much more efficient methods, but I think the machines also need to study the humans to evolve, for they cannot evolve naturally like humans do.  I like the the way the Wachowsky brothers made this movie, for it makes you think and I think that they left some questions purposely so that you could come up to your own ideas for what happened.  Oh and I don't have to mention the special effects.  (...)
B000002HO3|4.0|&quot;Simply Red&quot; is one of those bands I never thought too much about, until I picked this up. I didn't expect to know much besides &quot;Holding Back The Years&quot; and &quot;If You Don't Know Me By Now&quot;, but was suprised at the amount of other hits, and great music in general. Other well known songs include &quot;Money's Too Tight (to mention)&quot;, &quot;Right Thing&quot;, &quot;A New Flame&quot;, and the superb &quot;Stars&quot;. Other favorites of mine are &quot;Something Got Me Started&quot; and &quot;For Your Babies&quot;. There's also &quot;The Essentials&quot; best of, but this disc is much better than that. Basically, this is really just filled front to back with great pop/soul songs. It's well worth it even for just the two big hits, and should be in any music lovers collection.
B00009TB5G|5.0|See this movie.  At least three times.  It was over so quickly I couldn't believe it, even though it is over 3 hours long.  Needless to say, waiting for \\"The Return of the King\\" is the hardest part about loving this story.  The digital format does justice to the story, and the battle scenes are utterly stunning and overwhelming.  It is like nothing you have ever seen before.<BR>And it's still only the middle part of the story.
B000002KIE|5.0|I can't imagine anyone not having this yet, but if you have any interest in punk rock, this should be your first stop. Every element of this band screams punk. &quot;Johnny Rottens&quot; crazed yelling, over the rest of the groups perfect delivery, and the subject matter of most songs, pretty much defined the entire scene. Included are the classics &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;, &quot;Holidays In The Sun&quot;, and the often covered &quot;Anarchy In The U.K.&quot;. Two of my favorites are &quot;Submission&quot;, and the insane &quot;Bodies&quot;. In short, along with &quot;Ramones&quot; and &quot;London Calling&quot;, this is one of the few essential punk albums in history. That's why I keep it on cd, cassette, and vinyl.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|SARAH HAS REALLY DONE GOOD ON THIS CD!! I LOVE FALLEN AND ALL THE SONGS ON AFTERGOLW SHE HAS SUCH A PRETTY VOICE!! IT'S REALLY A GREAT SOUNDING CD!! GOOD LYRICS TOO!!<BR>YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS ONE IF YOU LIKE SARAH!!
0446691437|5.0|If you have a passion in your life -- writing, painting, music, sculpting, dancing, acting -- and if this passion is the reason you believe you're alive, then check out this book.  One of Pressfield's premises is that we're all MEANT for something, we're each here for some reason, to create something in the world (Eternity is in love with the productions of time) and if we don't live for and through this, then we're wasting our time.  He blasts away even the most stubborn and alluring resistances - the excuses we tell ourselves for not doing the work.  This book can rev you up -- it's short (165 pages)and powerful.  I breezed through the book in a few hours and felt energized.  Pressfield puts art-making in perspective, puts procastination in perspective, and delivers in a direct, conversational tone -- as one human who is trying to live a life that means something to another.  I've read a lot of &quot;how to&quot; books and most don't live up to their hype.  This one deals with how to overcome the obstacles of ambition and how (and why) to discipline yourself. As much as a cliche as it may sound, it will make a difference in how you look at what you do.  Give it to anyone else you know who wants to write, paint, act, dance, compose, and wants to follow their dream.
B00008CLOA|5.0|&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a musical journey through undiscovered notes and sounds. Every track is a spacy, &quot;out there&quot; song that pulls you in and gently drops you out at the end. Get out your old college bong and Wizard of Oz and zone out! BUY IT NOW!!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes put out the same stuff on a new cd with the same effect, good music, not much to think about. I hope the trend continues
B00006RU5B|5.0|Here's the scoop. I bought this album because I heard Cochise from my brother and it rocked. So I listen to Like A Stone and Show Me How To Live which he also had. They made Audioslave look even better so finally I went out and bought the album for my<BR>self. Right now Audioslave is at the top my list and not budging.<BR>Cochise is definatley my favorite one of all. Then Like A Stone. Then Exploder. Then Shadow On The Sun. Then Show Me How To Live I loved the guitar in that song. If you do buy the CD remember to go to Audioslave.com and unlock the bonus track Give it's a 4 star song. With the one of the best vocalists (Chris Cornell) and probably the best lead guitarists (Tom Morello) how can you not have one of the most Kick-Ass Bitchin' band of the millennium.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|there is some great quality music on here dont get me wrong.  but it seems like they have lost everything.  sully has been dissing other bands and has lost the respect of his fans.  But the music is great.  Love I STAND ALONE.  And Serenity are the best songs.  both of them sound completely different.  but they are about the best songs that godsmack has ever song.  they arnt as heavy as some think too. jk they are very heavy.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I really enjoy Ms. Badu album (Worldwide Underground) is definely a lay back album and that what I like about it. She change up her style of music because you can't depent on the same thing all the time. I feel that  made a really cool album. I wish it  was long then 10 songs but, Hey That's the way it goes in the business. I hope to see another album from Eryah Badu real soon.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is deffinatly the Best Album in the World. Every song has a amazeing beat with extrodinary lyrics. Every single song is worth listening to. Tupac Forever. We miss you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this show and have not watched the Fox network since they canceled Firefly without ever giving this wonderfully written and produced show a chance to build an audience.  I hope that everyone who loves good science fiction, excellent writing and just plain great entertainment will buy this DVD set, then drop Fox a note telling them just how stupid they were to let this gem slip through their fingers...
B00000DG1R|4.0|Great CD - Enjoy it!
0385504209|1.0|Read a real history book if you want to know the truth. Anyone who knows history would think this book is trash.
B00005JMFO|5.0|** I am adding this paragraph after reading all the bad reviews and the people who are hyper critical.  This movie is JUST a movie.  It is a romantic comedy which means you can't take anything too seriously.  If you leave a movie feeling entertained or you think humorously about it again the next day then it was a success.  I definitely thought about Love Actually again and again.  So don't let the critics control you- make your own decision.  It WAS AND IS FUN!!!<br />Now here's my original review- This was by far the best movie I have seen all year.  It was delightful the way they intertwined the several different love stories.  It made it very fun to see how they would all relate to eachother.  This was a fun movie that really was uplifting and encouraging.  It also reminds you how it felt when you first fell in love or maybe were waiting for someone to notice you!  Have fun and enjoy!
B00005JM02|5.0|Okay, the first time I saw Finding Nemo, I went really late to the theater and was so tired I couldnt wait for the movie to be over....fortunately I went to see it again with my cousins and it was much more enjoyable.  Nemo, to me, isnt AS funny as say the Toy Story series and Monsters, Inc, but the story is very good.  The whole movie is more cutesy in my opinion but its good to see that come back with Disney at times.  I definantly recommend it and after seeing it twice already before video I can tell its gonna grow on me the more I watch it. :)
0761119752|5.0|This book is great. My 5,4,year olds and my 21 month old love it. The older kids can \\"read\\" along with me and the baby points to the different items. The rhyming is fun and humorous.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I loved the first Matrix movie.  It was innovative and fresh; its characters were interesting and real--including the bad guys, such as Cypher (Joe Pantoliano); the special effects were top-notch; it had a plot.<br />The Matrix is everything that Reloaded is not.  The newly-introduced characters are paper-thin, and the only character development with our heroes Neo and Trinity is that they've gone to the next step in their relationship.<br />The fight scenes are tedious, stiff, over-choreographed, and overdrawn--Neo vs. 100 Agent Smiths?  Zzzzz.  The CGI looks bad at times (such as the freeway scene, which is probably the most interesting part of the movie).  The plot?  What little there is, I think they stole from Ghostbusters--something to do with a Keymaster (no Gozer here, though).<br />This was a very disappointing movie.  The worst part of the success of the second and third installments in the Matrix series is that it will give the Wachowski brothers the go-ahead to make more pretentious, self-indulgent video-games disguised as movies.
B000001EXR|4.0|this cd came out right when the reunion started so nobody really cared which is a shame because its probably their best since Lick It Up. This was the direction which Kiss was going in and i really thought it was cool. Unfortunately the reunion happened right after this was recorded and it just got lost in the mayhem. This cd is 100 times better than Psycho circus and it didnt even sell at all. It definately has a heavy vibe and some if it dark ala Alice in Chains. But its not commercial at all and the songs are really good. Bruce Kulick really shines here. its too bad that these songs will never ever be played live because theres no money in that. Too bad Kiss has become a tired oldies carnival act because this is where Kiss was really headed. Childhoods End is the best song on here and was cowritten with Tommy Thayer [kiss's new guitarist]. I like the overall sound and production which blows away the overproduced and horrible Psycho circus. Definately get this if you like your Kiss heavy.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|What a waste of time, money and effort. I want those 138 minutes of my life back! Was there a point to this mess?
B000001EKX|5.0|The songs on here are some of the best Kiss songs ever..Parasite,All the way,Goin blind,Got to choose,Hotter than hell. Unfortunately it is one of the worst sounding albums of all time. It sounds like the whole album was recorded in a tin can. The drums have absolutely no oomph at all , its sounds like Peter criss is banging on a barrel or something. its weird because the next album Dressed to kill sounds so clear and crisp and it was produced by the same guys. Comin home is the worst culprit here with sound quality. But even with this defect the album has great songs and is in the top 3 Kiss albums ever.
B00005JKJA|5.0|&quot;Love, only in my dreams....as real as it may seem..it was only in my dream.&quot;- D. Gibson<br />&quot;Just a dream, just a dream... all our plans and all our schemes.  How could I think you'd be mine...? The lies I tell myself each time.&quot;- old 50's song<br />Haunting, Beautiful, Compelling, Addictive, Heartbreaking, Oh so Hearbreaking.<br />Genius<br />Mulholland Drive  is equal parts film-noir mystery, a camp Hollywood parody, a comedy, a drama, and most of all and central to everything else: a love story- Hollywood style.<br />Of course, director  David Lynch(known for his inclination towards a   Fun-House mirror warping  sense of reality) then takes all these equal parts, adds a heavy dash of surrealism and TB full of  DMT(thats acid to you innocents)  to serve up a masterpiece. Everyone talks about making a film that is also a work of art, but few are the real McCoy. Forget 'The Hours',  'A Beautiful Mind' or the dreaded 'Chicago'. Mulholland Drive is the genuine article, and probably one the most well crafted and truly artistic commercial film in years. Open up the notebook kids, Mr. Lynch has officially announced that school is in session.<br />&quot;Have you ever had a dream that you were so sure was real?&quot;-Neo<br /> Muholland Drive  is..lucid dreaming, or the kind of intense dreams you have when you have a fever- part hallucination, part dream, part fantasy. Sleepwalking in your sleep. Its not so much a film or a movie, but to sound cliche, it truly is an experience. Sensations, emotions, impressions, and reactions are as important( or maybe moreso) than the who what why and where of things. Making love is about more than the concrete mechanics. The abstract feelings and emotions must compliment the kinetics. The sum is greater than its parts.<br />There is not one wasted shot or misplaced direction in this film; everything falls into place masterfully. Mosaic, tapestry, loom, whatever cliche you can think to illustrate this point, it applies. I liken it to  Jackson Pollack and his paintings about which he used to say that there were never any 'accidents' in his painting ea random element had the freedom to become whatever the painting wanted it to be in the end; methodical madness. David Lynch shows the same seemingly open-ended , but deceptively crafted control. Of course, some elements are more(or less) concrete than others, but even vagueness has its place in a film like this. There is no obfuscation, no befuddlement for the sake of befuddlement(or more to the point, b/c the writer or director had no real resolution for a troublesome plot element). The  importance of symbolism and totems in a film like this cannot be understated.<br />&quot;Speak to me in riddle, Speak to me in rhyme&quot;<br />Some art or artists can speak to your on a cerebral level and still manage to inflame the imagination. Theories on the nature of physics and the origins of the universe can be awe inspiring- humbling. Unfathomable. The theory of relativity as poetry. A moon shuttle launch as an allegory to the story of Prometheus and Fire.<BR>  <BR>Other works of  art or artists beckon you with words and images that flout logical explanation, but speak to you on a more emotionally immediate level; a visceral jolt, an intuitive understanding. Plath with her declaration &quot; I rise with my red hair, and I eat men like air&quot;. A Monet painting. Still photography. These elicit an emotive, primitive response- which compels you to search for meaning; to  analyze, deconstruct and as the 'Cowboy' says, to &quot;Think&quot;.<br />David Lynch shows his genius with this film- he does both. <br />A.N.
B00000AFDW|2.0|I think i listened to this 2 times since it came out. Its just kiss trying to make an overblown commercial album with the same producer from Destroyer but sorry folks it doesnt work at all. This is not where kiss was headed at the time. If you listen to Carnival of Souls which was recorded right before this with Kulick and Singer youll hear the direction that Kiss was going. This was basically made for the money because the fact that  it was a reunion record made everyone buy it. Too bad its one of the most unmemorable Kiss albums ever. The best song recorded for this isnt even on the cd. Its called &quot;its my Life&quot; and its on the boxed set. Lord knows why this song was left off here. Its better than the every song here combined. Anyway dont buy this, buy CARNIVAL OF SOULS if you want to hear some music with some depth and not just throwaway junk.
B00005N83M|4.0|Miss Lopez sophomore album became to prove that she's an oustanding performer and &quot;A STAR&quot;, long has been since an actress could become a succesful singer. JLO is a mixture of R&amp;B and latin beats, altough is clear that her boriquas roots are goin' to be alienated in the next effort.  JLO has a total of 5 singles releases, all of them became hits.  &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot; the second best track for my taste, &quot;Play&quot; the best track kind of prince-a-like, party stomper!, &quot;I'm Real&quot; the original version was ok, but the remix is a killer, &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot; I truly didn't like the original, but then the remix is so good that makes this one worth it, &quot;I'm Gonna Be Alright&quot; well this is the other way, the original is way better.  Something about JLO's feeling, is that the album is not trying to be something that is not, is a party happy feeling album with easy goin' lyrics and great upbeat joints, the good tracks are so good that they overshadow the fillers, this album is a classic just for the name JLO.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I walked into the theatre kind of scared of this movie.  So many people were giving it negative reviews online, but i watched it b/c i had to.  I was numb at the end.  I felt it was so well done, so philisophical and action - packed with a purpose, because people's lives are at stake in this movie.  People die, and this movie was such a well made and emotionally elevating movie i just completely fell for it (even some scenes in the beginning were forgivable).  Over all this movie is an astounding acheivement as a parralel to our world today.  I recommend it to all, but be warned, i went with several people to see this movie, and i was the only one there to truly understand the final 10 minutes.  See it not to be given answers, but to go and form your own. That's what the Matrix movies have always been about.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol sounds less like Joy Divison and more like Television. The vocalist does possess some of Ian Curtis's nervous energy, his taut, tense baritone, but as a few reviewers have already pointed out, the band itself doesn't put nearly as much emphasis on that heavy baseline hook, in the way that, for instance, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; does. Instead, Interpol are a guitar-rock band, and a great one at that.<br />As predictable as it may be, too, comparisons to Radiohead are inevitable--whenever you have a dense, not so radio-friendly, left-of-center guitar record, you throw in the Radiohead comparisons. Bah! I'm sick of discussing Radiohead. I'd much rather go back to the great bands of the late 70s, like Television. &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; is one of the seminal American guitar records, and even though Interpol's first LP isn't as revolutionary in sound, the same kind of talent is there--what you have is stellar musicianship; the production is gorgeous; and when Interpol is at their best (which is a frequent occurrence), I think only a select few can begin to rival them in terms of creating a fully-realized, overwhelming atmosphere. Sometimes I listen to Interpol, shut my eyes, and feel as if I'm literally being swallowed by the music. This band isn't messing around--they're here to win you over, and that they have done with great success in my own mind. <br />In many ways, I can't help but be pleased about the vulgar end of the 90s, with the onslaught of teen pop and boy bands for one simple reason: such terror angered enough people to start a band, to practice, and to show up these no-talent rich suburban kids. Interpol is at the very top of a large pile of good new bands--they may even be the best.
B00005JMFR|2.0|it felt like a movie from a different series, there were too many inconsistencies to forgive, and sheesh did the ending particularly reek, but overall it was closure of sorts.  certainly not worth the $...i paid.<br />success clearly went to the wachowskis' heads, and enough depth wasn't there to justify the added attention.  it is hard to blame the actors in this case.  it's obvious everyone wanted to recreate the impact they had had with matrix 1, yet it just didn't happen (matrix2 & 3 do not even rank).<br />nevertheless, it would be wrong to trivialize the success/impact matrix 1 had - that movie will be a good watcher for a long long time.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. Having been a long time fan since &quot;Solace&quot; and believing that &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy&quot; was her strongest album, I have to say that &quot;Afterglow&quot; is a step in the right direction to the Sarah we all know and love. Although I loved &quot;Surfacing&quot;... it was a different side of her, possibly fueled by Lilith Fair and her pop celebrity. But now, Sarah has returned to her alternative roots, while exhibiting a new, more mature and wise person. Her voice is as sweet as ever, and the songs flow from one to the other, seemless and spiritual. Personally, I would much rather wait 5 years for an excellent collection of songs, than stammer away through continual new albums that have no soul. Sarah writes from her heart and experiences, and all of us can relate to every word. Bravo Sarah! Nice to have you back! :)
B00005JMFR|5.0|With all the bad reviews of this film I expected it to really stink!<br />My worst fear was the it wouldn't answer all the questions it set up in Reloaded.<br />Thank goodness I was completely wrong!<br />In the first act, Neo visits the Oracle and asks her why he could stop the Sentinals at the end of Reloaded. She answers him in a very plain and simple fashion that only a fool wouldn't understand.<br />Nearly all the other questions are answered as well, if perhaps sometimes in a more subtle manner.<br />The brothers set up the trilogy in the very first episode to have Neo play the role of the Savior, and they follow through all the way - pulling no stops!<br />It was executed brilliantly! I couldn't ask for a better finish!<br />After first viewing, my score is a very strong 9 out of 10. (since I have to choose between 4 and 5 stars, I rounded up in this case.)
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Everyone says that the strokes havent done anything different from Is This It, but why mess with success. When musicians are reemed for singing about politics or failing in an attempt of experimentation, the strokes keep they're music FUN.The sole reason for spending money on a CD is to put it in your CD player and just sing along, strum an air guitar and just have fun. So if you want to buy a CD, I recommend Room On Fire and remember, its all about FUN.
0671027344|5.0|I have enjoyed the Perks of Being a Wallflower very much. The reason that I enjoyed it so was that it was believable. This is a &quot;coming of age&quot; story... about a boy on the cusp of manhood, with his surge of hormones and emotions driving him to the brink of insanity. It is a crude, unrefined glimpse into the mind of a mal-adjusted modern youth.You can relate to his situations but can at the same time be repulsed by his indecencey. He seems to develope an almost cynical view of the world as if his pure canvas of life was not just being painted upon, but soiled by the cruel realities of life. Every teen can relate to the feeling of not belonging at least to some extent. There is so much change so quickly at that age... some experience these changes with different consistency, intensity, and outcome.but it is essential in molding a person into who he or she is to ultimately become.It is a time of inner battles driven by environment, morality, and innate desires unlike experiences later in life, each experience in these years leave marks much like those in still wet cement.
B00008MZ0N|2.0|I liked this movie better when it had Keanu Reeves and was called 'Point Break'...<br />Not a bad movie, all the performances are well done (although disposable) and the action scenes are a lot of fun. However, it's not exactly breaking any new ground either.<br />I'm really not sure I'd spring twenty bucks to buy a copy, but it's definitely something I'd make it a point to see either as a rental or on cable.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Presiding over a scene resembling a Bosch-like hell, renegade Wizard Saruman, (Christopher Lee), intones menacingly, \\"The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new world order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear.\\" Saruman, in league with the evil, dark Lord Sauron, is bent on the destruction of mankind, beginning with the people of Rohan and leading to eventual control of the entire world. They want the One Ring of Power in order to succeed with their plans.<br />\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" takes over exactly where \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" left off. The transition from the first film to the second is so seamless that the idea to make all three films, parts one, two and three, at the same time with different release dates seems to have been an excellent one. The members of the Fellowship parted at the conclusion of the last movie. This film opens with Frodo Baggins (brilliantly played by Elijah Wood), the Ringbearing Hobbit, and his loyal companion Samwise Gangee, (Sean Astin), making their way through the grim landscape, over cold, misty mountains and through the Dead Marshes toward their goal to destroy the Ring. Demented, obsessed Smeagle, the Gollum, trails them and then, discovered, leads them toward their fate. Gandalf the Gray is left spiraling down a seemingly infinite abyss, fighting the terrible fire monster, Balrog. The man Aragon, (Viggo Mortensen), the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) after meeting up with the resurrected Gandalf, now called The White, go to the aid of the besieged Rohan people. Saruman waits for word of victory at Orthanc Tower in Isengard, while Sauron's fiery eye searches for the Ring and its bearer from his tower and fortress at Baraddur, in the terrible land of Mordor. The climatic battle at Helm's Gate is probably one of the most stunningly impressive battle scenes I have ever watched.<br />The special effects used in \\"The Two Towers\\" are absolutely amazing. I have never seen fantasy characters brought to life more brilliantly than in this film. Smeagle, the schizophrenic Gollum, is just as nasty, pathetic and sad as I imagined him from Tolkien's wonderful description. The orcs, the Balrog, the Ents, all come alive on the screen, wonderfully imaged and as good as one's own inner eye could imagine them. There were stupendous creative forces at work on this production. And the photography and scenery are breathtaking - absolutely spectacular! What a visual treat.<br />There is some departure from Tolkien's original text, but, for me, the film kept true to the spirit of \\"The Two Towers.\\" It is almost impossible to make an effective motion picture from a long and complex book, where all the details remain the same. A particularly poignant scene, worth noting, is the passing of the magical elves from this world. All in all, I really enjoyed every minute of this 5 star film. I have read Tolkien's Triogy at least three times, and never thought it would be possible to do such a wonderful film rendition. Kudos to Peter Jackson and his crew!sed in \\"The Two Towers\\" are absolutely amazing. I have never seen fantasy characters brought to life more brilliantly than in this film.

B00000IBRI|4.0|I originally saw, many years ago, this film under the title of Creepers. I even still have the VHS! I didn't like it the first time...it was just too strange. A couple years later I popped it in my VCR again, and I actually liked it. How could this be. The film has a real odd feel to it...dreamy like I guess. I don't know how else to put it. The atmosphere just got to me. I have recently picked up the DVD version under the title of Phenomena..and WOW! I didn't know Creepers had so much material cut out. I knew it had to have some because that Creepers version feels a little choopy in the edititing department, but I didn't know 20 minutes of footage was cut! It's like a whole new movie! It you like some off-the-wall horror movies, give this film a try. You won't be disappointed. If you don't like it the first time, watch it again. It seems to get better with each viewing.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|After 6 tedious years of silence, singer/songwriter Sarah McLachlan has finally returned to the music scene with her fifth full-length album, 'Afterglow', that is once again produced by Pierre Marchand.  This has personally been a long time coming for me as I've been craving new material from her for years now! She was one of the first singers I really got into growing up so when 'Surfacing' came out in '97 I was blown-away, of course, and immediately went out and bought everything from 89's debut 'Touched' to 91's 'Solace' and 93's 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy', which proved to be a bad mistake on my part. It was great to hear her sound vary and evolve from record to record but I exposed myself to too much at once and soon after became ravenous for more. I even purchased her 'Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff' in a desperate attempt to immerse myself in unreleased songs but I unfortunately owned almost all that was on there; except for a couple remakes of other artists. And just as I was about to give up hope on her recording another album, 'Afterglow' comes out and I'm thrilled beyond reasoning. I'm disappointed that the CD is only 40 minutes in length but I'm able to excuse that fact because I know she's had a trying past couple years. She was also on tour for many years promoting Lilith Fair and 'Surfacing' so her break hasn't been as long for her as its felt for us fans.<br />During the time Sarah McLachlan had off her life was bombarded with a roller-coaster of emotions. Her mother became very sick and died a mere few months before her daughter India was born. She went through the pain of losing someone near and dear to her heart yet she also felt the joy of bringing a person into this world and becoming a mother herself. In a short distance from each other she experienced both death and life and those feelings strongly reflect in her music. Her lyrics have always been a little dark but now it hits on a more personal level, and I believe it to be a healing process for her... 'Everything changes. Everything falls apart. I can't stand to feel myself losing control. In the deep of my weakness, I know'... \\"Stupid\\" is probably my favorite song on 'Afterglow'. The strings, acoustic guitars, piano, drums, and subtle synth flourishes rise up and around her passionate singing, adding to the affect of her words. I also love her first single, \\"Fallen\\", as well as \\"World On Fire\\", \\"Train Wreck\\", and the gorgeous, soul-stirring ballads \\"Drifting\\" and \\"Time\\" ('I need just a little more silence. I need just a little more time'...). Her beautiful voice continues to haunt me and I consider Sarah McLachlan to be one of today's most note-worthy artists.<br />I recommend 'Afterglow' with everything in me! It's so wonderful to hear her singing again and I don't think I realized how much I missed her until now.<br />A short while ago she performed a couple songs on my favorite radio station here in Los Angeles and said that it will probably be another 6 years before she records another album (she laughs) so I'm definitely going to see her live when she begins touring :-)ess for her...

B00009V7T2|5.0|treestamp, you look at music in a formulaic way. thats fine, but you have to understand that the mars volta can be interpreted in tons of different ways. just look at the variety of reviews. the mars volta are not trying to be an 80s metal band. theyre not trying to be a jazzrock band. theyre trying to be the mars volta. the mars volta is different from any other band i have ever listened to. yes, omar rodriguez plays good guitar. and if you can play me an 80s hair band guitarist that plays iron maiden type guitar in the context of the mars volta's music, ill respect you. what you are doing is taking the guitar in the mars volta's music out of it. youre playing iron maiden drum beats and plodding bass behind it. you dont look at the music as a whole. the guitar in the mars volta isnt one individual thing when played with all the other instruments. they mould together to make new sounds. you cant take the mars volta's music apart, because it was not meant to be dissected.

B00005JMFR|3.0|Ok, so, does anyones head hurt like mine does? I have seen all three matrix films now, and to tell you the truth... i dont know if I like the series or not. Dont get me wrong, visualy they are amazing, this latest instalment especialy. The futuristic human vs. machine battle sequences are astonishing. However, i dont know if the rest of the story... well... i dont know yet. I kind of frown upon any movie that i have to go see twice to fully understand. Now, maybe I am a total idiot when it comes to this last one, but understood all the other films no problem, they made perfect sense to me, but now this third instalment... i dunno. The whole thing kind slipped my grasp i guess. There are so many questions i have now, but for sake of spoiling the movie for others, i will refrain from asking them. I highly recomend seeing this film, it is very good. Deffinately worth it if for no other eason but the effects and visuals. But, as a friendly reminder... bring some asprin... you might need it!
B00006RU5B|5.0|April 9, 1997 was a dark day for the music world. That was the day that one of the greatest rock bands of all time broke up. Soundgarden was no more. Then after two and a half years, Chris Cornell resurfaced with his solo release Euphoria Morning. An awesome album, to be sure, but quite different from Soundgarden, which unfortunately led to poor album sales, and a lot of people missed out on one of the best albums of 1999.<br />Then, on the 20th of May, 2001, news came that two of the most influencial rock groups of the 90's were teaming up to bring us brand new music. Chris Cornell was to join up with former members of Rage Against the Machine to create a whole new supergroup with a whole new sound.<br />Although I was a big fan of Rage, I sometimes became somewhat annoyed with Zach de la Rocha, who I often thought was just screaming about nothing. Chris Cornell, whose extremely dynamic voice and array of melodies has got to be some of the finest of this generation, was a perfect choice to join up with these guys who were lacking in just that department.<br />Guitarist Tom Morello is very noteworthy as well. Throughout his career he has pioneered a new sound in guitar, and is one of the most original guitarists of his time. This is a musician that is right up there with Muddy Waters, Jimi Hendrix, and Vernon Reid in paving new roads in rock music and taking the lead rather than following. Very few artist can fill these shoes.<br />Along with what is quite possibly the most solid rhythm section in rock today, with the bass grooves of Tim C. and the straight forward tight drumming of Brad Wilk, this was a highly anticipated album by many.<br />Now, with the realease of Audioslave, I have have to say that I love it! The former members of Rage lend a really groovy feel which mixes excellently with Cornell's melodic vocals. There's a real retro feel on several of the tunes, and former members of Rage deliver on the awesome grooves for which they became famous, which work as well as I though they would on songs like Cochise and Set it Off. But they also get to explore new ground which they never could with their former group, coming up strong with some great mellow tracks like Like a Stone and The Last remaining Light.<br />At times the music can feel a little awkward because these guys still have some growing to do together, but it's still a solid effort. There's no doubt in my mind that if this group sticks with it, and they gel a little more, learning each others styles and capitalizing on their strengths, that they can and will become one of the greatest groups in the history of rock.
0312263120|4.0|The National Security Agency has been working for years on a method to intercept and crack any code or encrypted message sent via E-Mail across the globe.  They finally developed a machine so powerful that it can decode even the toughest messages in just a matter of minutes.  The machine is dubbed TRANSLTR.<br />The existence of TRANSLTR is threatened when a bitter, crippled Japanese programmer threatens to release an encryption method that TRANSLTR can't crack: Digital Fortress.   Digital Fortress is placed up on the web, encrypted in itself so that only those with the passcode can unlock it.  The NSA learns the programmer is working with a partner as a safety measure.  If he should die, the partner will publish the passcode within 24 hours.<br />The programmer is found dead in Spain and the NSA must race the clock to obtain both passcodes before it is too late.<br />The whole idea that keeping Digital Fortress out of the hands of the public was a life or death situation seemed a little too weighty for me.  I believe the basic idea of Digital Fortress is that the encryption was constantly revolving, making it impossible for a computer to guess when the correct passcode had been entered.  Anyone in the computer world knows that everything has a workaround.  It may be that Digital Fortress would make TRANSLTR extinct, but necessity is the mother of invention and people would eventually figure out how to break into a file encrypted by Digital Fortress.<br />Therefore, the book seemed a little bloody to me.  People were taking the issue WAY too seriously.<br />If you put the absurdity of the subject matter aside, I still enjoyed the book.  I'm really starting to like Dan Brown's work.  I've also read the Da Vinci Code and both books are filled with information you may not have previously known (such as where the term &quot;sincerely&quot; really comes from).  They were also both written in real-time.  I absolutely love books written in real-time.  No skipping ahead three months and losing a portion of the person's life.  No thought or detail left unattended.<br />It was a good, dark read that I really enjoyed.  I can't wait to delve into some of Dan Brown's other works.
0395951054|3.0|The first thing to consider before reading this book, is whether or not you have at least a basic understanding of early 20th century Germany. If not, it would be very easy to get lost in the dragged out rants that Hitler writes about these times. That being said, this book was by no means exceptional. As a matter of fact, I believe that had it not been for his brilliant oratorical skills, there's no way Hitler would have ever gained the power that he did based on the banality of this book.<br />Throughout this book, the author contradicts himself, and causes confusion for the reader, and I don't believe that it's just clarity lost in the translation, it's a general lack of good writing skills. He also has a tendency to spend several dozen pages saying what can be said in just one or two. Hitler thinks of himself as the messiah of Germany, and it comes out in not too subtle of a way. In fact I even hypothesized that the division of the book into two part was some kind of pathetic attempt for the author to create his own Bible like the Holy Bible with it's old and new testaments.<br />There are several shining moments, however, throughout the book where Hitler makes some very valid points about the state of society and human nature. He writes about the failure of the school system to teach history properly, an argument that I believe holds true today. As well as the struggle of the lower classes and the vicious circle of discrimination and poverty that they face.<br />What is important here is to understand that Hitler wasn't just some monster. He was a man. A man with ideas, very dangerous ideas. All too often we dismiss Hitler as a madman, and don't even try to understand the rage and anger that was inside him. To not learn from history, is to doom ourselves to repeat it. There are leaders today, not just in middle east and other war-torn nations, but even in the free world who mirror some of the dangerous ideas that made Hitler who and what he was. It is so crucial for us, as a society, to oppose the acts of our leaders that perpetrate these same actions and principles. To break from mainstream thought, to put together the pieces of the real truth, and to think for ourselves.<br />What Mein Kampf allowed me to do was to begin to recognize patterns in leaders and to look past media propaganda. This book serves as a lesson of the danger of ignorance.<br />So if you are looking for something that is a good read, this is definitely the wrong book, because it is slow, repetitive, and oftentimes it seems as though the author is just trying to sound too intelligent. It's definitely not some of Hitler's most captivating words. But, as a historical document, and point of reference for recognizing dangerous thought, it is essential. I don't think that this book is going to gain any followers to the Nazi cause, so as far as I'm concerned, it should be mandatory reading.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Having purchased all of Sarah's previous albums, Afterglow is definitely the weakest of them all. Other then &quot;Falling&quot; none of the other songs are really in the same league. I was expecting better. If you're new to Sarah McLachlan, I recommend purchasing &quot;Mirrorball&quot; first, as I feel it is the best compilation of her songs.
B00006M183|4.0|For more than a decade now Pearl Jam have been producing albums. This band seemed to have come out of nowhere to spawn a whole new generation of rock, produce some mighty horrible knock-off bands like Creed, and revive some of the political activism that was seen in the bands of the sixties.<br />Their high point came with their first album, Ten, and then hit a low with their third release Vitalogy. Since then, they have been slowly scraping their way back up, and witthe firing of the nauseatingly lame Jack Irons, and the addition of the greatly talented Matt Cameron (of Soundgarden fame), they are able to more easily make their way back up the rock ladder.<br />Granted, they have been doing their own thing, and that is very respectable, but sometimes it just seemed as though they weren't even making an effort. Unlike bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, however, PJ is at least making an effort to consistantly pave new roads, even though they don't always work, instead of putting out the same crap over and over.<br />On this release Riot Act the high points come with the songs written by Matt Cameron (proving the invaluable worth he brings to the band) such as You Are and Cropduster, and the some of the more boring and redundant moments come in the same old Eddie Vedder-written shlock like the album's first single I Am Mine.<br />Overall, the strengths of this CD far outway it's weaknesses, and make it a worthwhile addition to a music collection. I would recommend it.
B00005JMFR|5.0|And what a finale this was! The Wachowski brothers really surpassed themselves with this third & final instalment to the Matrix trilogy. And it knocks the socks off the previous two.<br />The CGI is amazing, and totally takes your breath away. It does sort of take over, but this doesn't detract from the film itself. The APUs are powered exoskeletons, similar but larger and more impressive than the ones in Alien. I was sitting there watching this film, wondering how the Wachowski brothers got these ideas into their heads, and then made the successful transfer from mind to screen. Genius!<br />There are a lot of minor characters in this film, some which featured in smaller roles previously, but are brought forward for the swansong. These included Persephone, played by Monica Bellucci, who was wasted. She had one line to say, and there were only two reasons for her to be in this.<br />The film starts about as abruptly as Reloaded finished. It does carry on from where Reloaded left off, but one big tip - if you have Reloaded on DVD, watch it before going to see this. Just to refresh your memory. It does start very slowly but not for long.<br />The critics and audiences marvelled at The Matrix when it originally came out. Reloaded was a disappointment, according to some, but they will be in awe of Revolutions. The Wachowski brothers took the original ideas, and made them even better. The CGI, the spectacular fight scenes - although they don't quite match up to the fight between Keanu Reeves & the 100 Agent Smiths in Reloaded.<br />The main stars of this seem to disappear about halfway through, but you don't miss them - you're too busy watching the action unfold on screen.<br />There are some sad bits in this film, all the way through, but it's fast paced, and I didn't want to know what the time was once.<br />Keanu Reeves is great - and he is so sexy when he's wet! Morpheus, thankfully, doesn't do the whole babble again, which most people were put off by during Reloaded.<br />There is, however, some religious imagery during Revolutions, especially towards the end. If you look out for it, you'll notice it. Or if you're like me, you won't, until someone points it out.<br />You have to go out and see this. No matter what you thought of Reloaded, whether you loved or hated it, this film blows your mind. No doubt about it. But beware, there's a lot of stroboscopic effects.<br />Has the ending of Revolutions been left open for another?!oaded.<br />There is, however, some religious imagery during Revolutions, especially towards the end.

B000067CPX|1.0|The more the Chili Peppers continue to release albums, the more my opinion seems to be secured. The Chili Peppers are like the Rolling Stones in a sense, because although they release very boring and irrelevant music, they continue to sell albums because they are the Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br />There were a few high points on the latest album, but overall it was a flop. Their peak came with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and every album since has been consistantly worse than the last. As a matter of fact, I'd say that their first couple of drug-induced studio ventures were probably much better than this one.<br />There is a solid performance on the album from the two lesser-know members of the group, Chad and John, but Flea just doen't know when to chill, making his bass playing, although technically sound, annoying to listen to. Anthony, well hea hasn't done anything new, ever. It's just the same old crap we've heard a million times before from him. It worked in the early 90's, when his froup was funkier, and he seemed more into, but now he's just bad.<br />There was other factors that contributed to the suckiness of this album, but I don't feel like typing anymore about it...

0312319517|5.0|Most days, Calvin Dexter is a lawyer with the odd hobby of running triathlons. But for the right price and the right cause, the fifty-something Viet Nam veteran becomes 'the avenger,' a man who will bring criminals from around the world back to the U.S. for justice. And the family of Ricky Colenso needs justice. Their darling son took off the summer before he started in college to serve as a humanitarian volunteer in Bosnia. The murderer, head of a Serb militia, has vanished, along with the billions of dollars he looted from the former Yugoslav economy. It's the Avenger's job to track the killer down and bring him to America where he can be tried for his crimes.<br />Tracking down a billionaire killer would be a tough job for anyone, even a survivor of the tunnel warfare in Viet Nam. But the killer has more protection than the private army, the bribed government of the South-American country where he hides, and the sharks that surround his isolated compound. The CIA has identified him as a part of its war on terrorism and will do anything to protect him. If that means selling out the Avenger, the CIA agents consider it cheap at the price. Because their target is nothing less than Osama Ben Laden. And in the war on terrorism, even in the last days before 9/11, no sacrifice is too great if it advances the cause.<br />Author Frederick Forsyth is a longtime master of the adventure suspense novel and AVENGER is a welcome addition to the canon. Calvin Dexter makes an interesting and sympathetic hero. With his own personal losses (his daughter was kidnapped and murdered in the white slave trade), Dexter is believable. His Viet Nam experience and the wealth of contacts he made while a lawyer for New York's poor and immigrant population both make him convincing despite his eligibility for membership in the American Association of Retired People. Forsyth is a master of presenting the reader with an ethical dilemma. In his masterpiece, THE DAY OF THE JACKAL, he engages our sympathies with an amoral killer. Here, Forsyth uses the events of 9/11 to make the CIA agent's position sympathetic even as we cheer Dexter on in his attempts to bring an evil man to justice.ympathies with an amoral killer.

B00008LOS1|1.0|How could MCA release a remastered version of this greatest of all WHO albums in March, 2003, and use only antiquated 44.1K Hz CD technology?  The Rolling Stones hybrid SACD/CD remasterings of the past year are of stunning sound quality.  Pink Floyd is out on SACD.  MCA, don't leave the Who behind.  I'll wait on this purchase until I can hear the real sound that is on those vaulted tapes in a DSD remaster.
B00005T7I1|3.0|While the movie is visially great the writers seemed to have forgotten that it was not just the appearance of Gould's villans that made them famous and interesting but their character traits as well. Adding to this problem is that seemingly every famous villain Gould created between 1938-1949 is in the picture. So not only do you have way too many characters to flesh out properly but for them to fit the story many of the character traits and professions Gould gave them in the strip had to be removed or changed.<br />The irony here is because of this the LESS you know of Gould's actual creations the more you will enjoy the picture.  Conversely if you are a die hard Tracy fan who knows Gould's villains inside and out this film is very disappointing.
B00000DCHD|5.0|In 1978,Billy Joel,even at the beginning of the year,experienced the deserved success of his hit album THE STRANGER. In the fall that same year,52ND STREET was released and became a success just as big as THE STRANGER. MY LIFE became a Top 10 hit as did BIG SHOT,HONESTY and ROSALINDA'S EYES. This album had a quite a few jazz pieces(ROSALINDA'S EYES,STILETTO,UNTIL THE NIGHT,ZANZIBAR and the title track). Guest artists include Peter Cetera of Chicago. MY LIFE would later be covered by an unknown artist for the theme to TV's &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;.
0385504209|4.0|When reading this book one should always keep in mind that this genre of book is going to be frought with peril from a writing standpoint.<br />Let's get to the point here.  Mr. Brown clearly has a love for this topic.  He has spent LOTS of time and energy seeking out knowledge about this. This book is a vehicle for him to express his ideas, concepts and theories in fiction form.  True, the writing is contrived and clumsy.  Also, his techniques for ramping up the drama and suspense are not very compelling.  In addition, I would agree with several other reviewers that most of the dialogue sounds like a lecture series.  Okay, the book has obvious weaknesses in terms of form and construction.<br />That being said, Mr. Brown is giving us the fruits of his labors with regard to his research.  That's what I love about speculative history fiction novels.  The writer gives the reader a lifetime of investigation on a subject wrapped around some kind of half-way decent plotline.  One learns a lot about something interesting without having to invest tons of time sifting through materials that may or may not shed any more light on the subject at hand.  Oftentimes, these books introduce the reader to something facinating that the reader didn't even know existed before.<br />I get the feeling that this is one of those books.  Definitely, read this book and enjoy the exposition of Brown's theories.  Hopefully, it will spur you on to look into this strange topic more closely on your own.<br />Read, ponder, decide for youself.
B000002H70|5.0|Robert Smith says that that his true albums were the \\"trilogy\\", which included Pornography, Disintigration, and Bloodflowers. I have just been introduced to the Cure and have yet heard all of the other 2 albums, but I must say that if Pornography and Bloodflowers are as half as good as Disintigration, they will be worth the money.<BR>     This album is full of beautiful melodies and eerie soundscapes, making it appeal to fans of gothic music, which is what im into. It is full of depressing lyrics and music, which makes it a great cd to listen to or a rainy day. The length of the songs only gives the album a better listen. The rich keyboards and synths, plus the shimmering guitar lines backed with lusterous chorus gives you the feeling like you are in a dream. The sound of Disintigration simply pierces your heart. My favorites include Plainsong, Lullaby, and Homesick. I cant wait to check out the other 2 albums in Robert Smith's \\"trilogy\\". Disintigration is truly the best rainy day or broken-hearted cd I have ever heard.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Six years after her last album, Surfacing, Sarah is back with the sweet brilliance and honesty of Afterglow.  From the moment &quot;Fallen&quot; starts playing, you are taken away into a world of your own, where Sarah's simple words evoke such strong feelings and sentiments.  From start to finish, this album is an emotional ride that everyone can connect with.  From the silliness of loving someone you shouldn't in &quot;Stupid&quot; to whispered tones of love and need in &quot;Answer&quot;, down to the regrets of love gone wrong in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot;, one cannot help but think &quot;I have been there too.&quot;<BR>Not since the 1993's masterpiece Fumbling Towards Ecstasy has Sarah shone so bright.
B0000DD79B|1.0|This is one *weird* CD.<br />First of all, do not believe the other reviewers here who tell you that, for the most part, you get the original versions of the S&amp;G songs.  For the MOST part what you get are NOT the original versions of the songs.  You get a lot of live versions but, what is worse, you get a whole lot (perhaps 80%) of &quot;new&quot; versions of the classic songs.<br />This isn't a bad thing if you already own the S&amp;G classics -- but if you own them, why in the heck do you want this CD?  Yes, the sound quality is superb, but the two CDs here by and large sound like some sort of S&amp;G &quot;cover&quot; band: a very good cover band, but nowhere near the original music.<br />This is not the first time someone has put together a &quot;collection&quot; of what is supposedly their greatest hits, but it's the first time I've ever heard one with such odd reorchestrations.  &quot;Cecilia&quot; is done at half speed, &quot;Baby Driver&quot; with such over orchestration it goes from being cute to pretentious, &quot;The Only Living Boy In New York&quot; goes from intimate to overblown.  And so on.<br />Anyone who grew up with S&amp;G (or anyone who wants the best) needs to own &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot;.  These two essential S&amp;G CDs will give you both nearly every song in this &quot;essential&quot; collection, but give them to you in their pristine, S&amp;G classic sound versions.  Then if you want to hear new versions of these classics by all means go ahead and buy this collection.  But don't buy it thinking you're getting the essentials -- this, as Robin Williams once said, is not essence, it's pee-pee-ca-ca.

B0000AR8NK|3.0|(But it could have bitten harder)<br />David Bowie's career is really something of a mystery to me.  After producing a series of rock's greatest moments from 'Hunky Dury' to 'Scary Monsters', Bowie seemed to have pretty much disappeared in the 1980s and early 1990s, with few songs like Let's Dance, Tin Machine's cover of 'Debaser' and 'Jump' as the only things to show from those long, long years.<br />Then came OUTSIDE, Bowie's collaboration with Brian Eno and his return to form with 'Hello Spaceboy', one of his best songs, and an absolute favorite of mine.  Even better, 1997's EARTHLING was one of Bowie's classic records, certainly the strongest in the 20 years since 'Scary Monsters'.  With brilliant tracks like 'Dead Man Walking', 'Little Wonder', and especially the disturbing 'I'm Afraid of Americans' (with the haunting lyric \\"God is an American...\\"), Bowie seemed set to conquer the world once again.<br />Then came 'Hours...', and what seemed like Bowie's attempt to reinvent himself yet again, but now as an aging balladeer singing Middle of the Road Pop.  In my view one of Bowie's worst records, 'Hours...' could not be saved by the sole good track 'The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell'.<br />2002's HEATHEN was an improvement.  With one of Bowie's best singles 'Slow Burn' (make sure to miss the terrible Top of the Pops version), Heathen had several more strong tracks, such as the bittersweet 'Everyone Says Hi', and the Neil Young cover 'I've Been Waiting for You'.  Still, Heathen was far from perfect.  The most obvious misstep was the cover of the Pixies's Cactus, and as much as the reviewers praised Tony Visconti's production, I felt it was rather cold and soulless.<br />REALITY, Bowie's newest, is no radical departure from Heathen.  Tony Visconti returns, as do the unfortunate covers.  But rather then being Heathen, part II, Reality is a stronger record then the 2002 effort, and I hope it marks a trend for newer and better things.<br />Perhaps the most frustrating thing about 'Reality', is that too many songs seem almost, but not quite, finished.  Bowie can still write very memorable melodies, hooks and lines, but the songs don't quite fit together.  <br />This is most notable in what should've been the Killer singles, \\"Never Get Old\\" and \\"She'll Drive the Big Car\\".  Both songs have great potential.  They have catchy, strong choruses, that are marred by the production and by the refusal to let them gather momentum.  It's really a shame - had they been tighter (and had the lyrics of 'Never Get Old' been reworked a little) both could have been classics.<br />Similar charges could be made about 'New Killer Star' (which has some great lyrics 'See my life in a comics/Like the way they did the bible').  It is suffers  irritating background singers and the lack a of punch, which is a shame, as it has a nice melody and a great guitar riff.<br />Unfortunately, some of the songs are just average ('Days', 'Fall Dog Bombs the Moon'), and the choice of covers has been atrocious.  'Pablo Picasso' is a great song, but it has been given the ultimate cover by John Cale.  Bowie completely rewrites the melody, and the lyric does not fit at all.  The additional lyrics are really an embarrassment (Swinging on the back yard/Jumping off a big log/Pablo Feeling better now/Hanging by his fingernails???).  The lesser said about the George Harrison tune, given a Vegas-y treatment, the better.<br />The offbeat closer, 'Bring Me the Disco King' is anything but average, a strange, part Jazz part Punk song, which I frankly don't quite know what to think of.<br />The best track is the Hard Rockin' title track.  The pounding drums, the wild guitars, the melodic cries which become desperate-yet-ironic screams, the haunting lyrics 'I've built a wall of Sound to separate us'- this is Bowie at his very best.   \\"I never looked over reality's shoulder, ha ha ha ha\\" Bowie sings, and I'm sure he means it.  Bowie has always played with illusions, and reality must be just another one.  But it sounds so good...
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd was very good, like the first one all the songs  were very good. i like this about linkin park, in all their cds all the songs are always good. this cd was a little more rock as in screaming but it was really good. linkin parks songs are always something you can relate to.

0767836324|2.0|HOOK is only notable for its casting of Dustin Hoffman (Captain Hook), Robin Williams (Peter Pan), Julia Roberts(Tinkerbell?), and Bob Hoskins (Smee). The film starts off well with the grown-up Peter Pan (Williams) who is now Peter Banning with no memory of being Pan. He has grown-up problems, is unhappily married, has a couple of rotten kids, and is interested in chasing the big bucks. He goes to London to visit his Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) to get some advice and recapture his lost youth.  Suddenly his kids are kidnapped (by Captain Hook) he is forced to face his past (with the help of Tinkerbell/Roberts) and become Peter Pan and must go to Neverland.  This is where the film falls.  The children characters are not very likable (if not annoying) and Neverland looks like a cross between Disneyland and the sets of the original Star Trek when Kirk and crew are on some alien planet terrain. Speilberg's direction is haphazard and disjointed in the Neverland sequences as he uses the same type of direction he employed to make another failure of his (the film '1941'). Robin Williams is decent as Pan, but has no chemistry with the children who have no chemistry among themselves. Julia Roberts was truly a marketing ploy, but does a great job as Tinkerbell, and Hoffman has presence in everything he does but the film doesn't gel. Siskel and Ebert commented that Neverland had been explored all ready, so the filmakers should have had an urban/modern setting for the battle between Hook and Pan.  That would have been interesting! The film is okay in the beginning exploring the questions of lost youth and the origin of 'Peter Banning', but overall, once the film shifts gears into fantasy, it fails.  This is mainly because the 'Neverland'sequences are badly directed, the setting looks cheap, and the whiney children and all the inhabitants of Neverland are all terrible.
0793518326|2.0|I've spent only a few minutes with this book (evaluating its suitability and accuracy for a student taking on an analysis in one of my theory courses). I've looked at only four songs and I've found some pretty disturbing inaccuracies, everything from slightly off transcriptions to completely fictionalized guitar parts and even some ridiculous typos in the lyrics. The biggest problem would seem to be the copyist's insistence on the use of repeat signs. In all four cases, this introduced a good number completely avoidable inaccuracies in the scoring (because, as we all know, nobody in pop plays their part exactly the same way the second or third time through the changes). Yes, the book would double or triple in length if the recordings were totally &quot;through-scored,&quot; but in nearly all cases this is the only way to obtain faithful and/or sensible-looking transcriptions. <br />I note that something called the &quot;NEW Beatles Complete Scores&quot; is posted on Amazon as a future product-- let's hope that when they get around to it, they'll do a cleaner job. We're fifty years in-- someone needs to set standards for rock transcriptions, so that rock works can finally be acceptably studied in serious music programs. I can think of no better vehicle for this &quot;revolution&quot; than the Beatles, but Hal Leonard really dropped the ball on their first attempt.
B00005JM0B|2.0|T2 was a simply awesome movie. At the end Director Cameron closed the time loop thus putting a neat and tidy end to the series. The Terminator series ended with T2. Period.<br />Now how is Hollywood to deal with this? Visions of an unending franchise and dump trucks full of money have, as usual, overcome good taste and saddled us with T3... to be followed by T4.. then T5 .....ad infinitum... ad nauseum.<br />Just wait if you don't believe me. The ending of the superior film, T2, resulted in there being no future to send more Terminators back from. Future history was rewritten. For T3 a brand new futire is invented to keep the franchise going. Worse we get a totally ridiculous idea that a highly sophisticated computer program that controls all the weapons in the world, Skynet, could exist in the lines of the internet itself without a server. Oh yeah right, sure, you bet. The US Military has it's freaking nuclear weapons connected to the World Wide Web so that some shadow virus can launch everything. Pull my other leg!<br />Note at the end of T3 that it is hanging for another sequel. This is the true purpose of T3... a Neverending Franchise. Expect T4 before too long. <br />Just as  the Alien series went to the toilet when the supremely arrogant Sigourney Weaver gained control over the plots of 3 and 4 (did anyone else notice this?) the Terminator series is headed the same way with hack Director after hack Director turning out schlock that James Cameron wouldn't use to line his garbage cans.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I was lucky enough to preview this movie the night before it was released for the masses, and there's one thing for sure...<br />If there were two camps equally frustrated and ecstatic about the prospects of 1) Understanding the nature of free-will and then TALKING about it for an hour, and then 2) Watching some of the most unbelievably intense battles ever screened for an hour... there'd be a shoulder-shrugging bunch of movie-goers leaving the theater struggling to admit how much they absolutely loved this film.<br />If you're like me, and you'd wait in line for EITHER, then you need to get in line for this one... since it should be viscerally what you cannot fathom poetically... or... the battle for good and evil, whatever that means, better be the holy-mother-gunship of earth-battles you've ever dreamed it could be.<br />Guess what, it is!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Though MR wasn't very good, it was worth it to see hundreds of juvenile minds on Amazon.com insulting those who could recognize MR's sophomoric cause/effect/fate/choice/vomit philosophy for what it was.<br />Advice to MR lovers: If you are going to insult those who thought MR was puerile you should at least do so with a level of grammar and spelling above the 4th grade level. It would be more impressive that way. I doubt that Kant or Neitzche would lose much sleep over their philosophy being challenged by that of MR and it's semi-literate partisans.
B00005JMFR|1.0|Hardly entertaining except maybe that you laugh at the ridiculousness.  I can't believe that the film was even produced.  Didn't anyone read the script and realize what crap it is?
B00005JMFO|4.0|Charming film, lots of heart, great actors, insightful and witty script.  The boy in the film was wonderful (and completely believable - there ARE earnest, prococious ten-year-old boys out there, and I've known a few of them). I do agree that the recurring simulated sex between the adult film actors/ body doubles gets uncomfortable and redundant.  But you can close your eyes, I guess.  Emma Thompson certainly turned in a gut-wrenching performance...however, the guy you'll really remember is the outrageous, burnt-out rock star - oh does he crank the comedy up to \\"11\\"!!!  Sure to be a romantic comedy classic like \\"Four Weddings.\\"
B000002UAO|2.0|After the powerful early Beatles releases, followed by A Hard Day's Night and Help, the Beatles slumped into the world of acoustics, orchestras, and slow pop with Rubber Soul.  Unfortunately, they wouldn't re-emerge as rock artists until 1968 with the White Album and then released Abbey Road as a farewell.  Comprising the slump were Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper, and Rubber Soul was among the least impressive.  With songs like You Won't See Me, Wait, The Word, Think for Yourself, What Goes On and Michelle, this is tough to get through.  It really hasn't stood the test of time.<BR>Focus on the early albums.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Medical student Herbert West has discovered the means of bringing the dead back to life, unfortunately for fellow student  Dan Cain. Dan has just taken Herbert in as his new roommate, against his girlfriend's wishes, but Herbert didn't give them much choice in the matter. He threatened to snitch on Dan's inappropriate premarital activities with the Dean's lovely daughter. Soon, Dan is forced to decide whether or not to become an accomplice in Herbert West's gruesome experiments, the results of which can only lead to pure horror.<br /><br />In a time when the horror genre is getting a tad repetitious...again, discovering \\"Re-animator\\" was a welcome treat (Many thanks to my bud, John, for the gift). The story cleverly blends \\"Frankenstein\\" with \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" to create an original film with the frightful tongue-in-cheek humor of \\"An American Werewolf In London\\" and \\"Evil Dead.\\" If gore is your thing (though I'm a squinter myself), this film is right up your alley too, with scenes that just might make you lose your lunch. And if cute little blondes are your type (as they are mine), Barbara Crampton is an intense pleasure to see as Dan's girlfriend and the Dean's daughter, Megan Halsley, and you will see ALL of her on this awesome Millennium Edition DVD.  Bruce Abbott (Dan Cain) and the rest of the cast are excellent as well, including David Gale as the villainous Dr. Carl Hill, whose inexplicable mind control powers make him a dangerous adversary for the re-animators. But the film truly belongs to Jeffrey Combs, Mr. Herbert West himself, who truly made his mark on the genre with this must-see cult classic. But hey guys, if for nothing else, you gotta check this out for Miss Crampton. She is very well put together!
B000001IPP|5.0|Let's Go! was the first of many Rancid CD's I bought and it blew me off my chair while I put the record on. It is probably the best Rancid record ever. Its pure and raw punk no ska but just punk. This is the record that made Rancid popular (not shure if thats a good thing). It contains all the their classics such as: Nihilism, Radio, Salvation and ofcourse Let's Go. The songs contain great guitar solos and amazing bass riffs by Matt. The singing duo Tim and Lars make this record sound a lot different than their first CD (Rancid- Selftitled 1993). <BR>This is defeinetly a must buy for any real punk fan, don't think Blink-182 fans should listen to this record as they will find it too rough and actually don't deserve to listen to it. <BR>So go out to the store and buy this great record!
1590710037|5.0|The beauty of this book is that it can be applied to a variety of endeavors in life.  It is meant to be read many times for reflection and inspiration.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|If you are a Sarah McLachlan fan, as I have been now for about 9 years, she will not disappoint you with her new cd release &quot;Afterglow&quot;. Is it less commercial friendly then Surfacing? Perhaps.  However, Ms McLachlan went through the joys of the birth of her daughter India and the loss of her mother to cancer all within months of each other. The joy and the pain can be felt althroughout &quot;Afterglow&quot;. With songs like &quot;World On Fire&quot; about the tragedy of 9/11 to &quot;Answer&quot; which will sure be played at all upoming weddings to &quot;Stupid&quot; which just shows off the power in Sarah's vocal range, &quot;Afterglow&quot; satisfies the desperate need of qulaity music, much of what is lacking on todays radio.
B00009V7RF|1.0|This CD is replete with foul language and sexual themes.  I read the Amazon reviews before buying and since no one mentioned that this is NOT APPROPRIATE for kids, there was no parental advisory placed on the CD and the song \\"Where Is The Love\\" (which I had heard on the radio & like) is not objectionable (other than politically, for some) I bought this for my 12-year-old son as a gift.  As we listened to it in the car the day we received it, I had to skip song after song after song -- by mid-CD I had to tell my son that he could not keep it. I may just be too old (34) or un-cool for this genere, but I sure wish I'd been warned in advance.

The streak continues with &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot;.

B00008H2LB|2.0|Ok now don't get me wrong here i used to really like lp in hybrid theory days they were new there lyrics were amazing, The reanimation came out the only thing that kept them from fully selling out here was guest appearences by Jonathan davis (KoRn) and aaron lewis( staind) Meteora though is very stale and repetitive the guitars drums electronics and the mix of singing and rapping gets old fast and you can't even hear the bass. Its sad to see a good band go bad, now you might be thinking why didn't i just rate this 1 star? well because the 1st single &quot;somewhere i belong&quot; has meaning isn't stale and shows potential for this and same with breaking the habit but other then this the album sounds like they failed at making hybrid theory pt. 2
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I am tired of seeing people rate this album negatively for such mundane and closed-minded reasons.  This album is the definition of brilliance!  In case anyone noticed, Gregorian chants are a thing of the past.  Electronica is where it's at nowadays and Enigma has crafted a new and unique blend of it with Voyageur.  This evolution was evident with the 2001 single, &quot;Turn Around&quot; from the LoveSensualityDevotion album.  <br />Looking back at Enigma's career, one can easily see that the &quot;original&quot; sound was getting a bit tired.  The 2000 album, The Screen Behind The Mirror, while great, did nothing more than sample the 1990 album MCMXC a.D.  &quot;Smell of Desire&quot; even used the same lyrics from &quot;Mea Culpa&quot; and the same chants as &quot;Sadeness&quot;!  If Cretu had used the same technique in Voyageur, it would've meant the end of Enigma.  Instead, Michael Cretu delivers a superbly crafted, original and fresh new sound that quite frankly borders on genius.  Everything from the beats to the background sound effects are new.  The only reminder of the olden days is a small sample from &quot;Sadeness&quot; deep in the background of the song, &quot;Incognito&quot;.  Check out the lush atmospheres of &quot;From East To West&quot;, &quot;In the Shadow, In The Light&quot;, &quot;The Piano&quot;, and &quot;Weightless&quot;.  Marvel at the three singles from the album, &quot;Voyageur&quot;, &quot;Following the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Boum-Boum&quot;! <br />Lyrically, this album is in par with the rest of them.  Cretu was never a lyrical mastermind.  But otherwise, the album is fantastic.  Not since Madonna's Ray of Light has an album affected my like this one.  I imported it in early September and it has not left my CD player since.  This is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard....ever!  This is not only a must-have for Enigma fans, but a must-have for any fan of electronic music!

B000002AVF|5.0|This is mariah's best album by far! if you don't own this already, then make it your next buy! everyone should have this CD in their collection! You can't deny this talented singer with such an amazing voice. Songs like &quot;When I Saw You,&quot; &quot;Fantasy,&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot; truly show she can't be denied. Anyone who says she's not good is only overwhelmed and blown away by the fact that she's beyond good. Her strong voice can sing so high and hold it for a long period of time. How many singers can do that? Very few. This is a must have for any music lover of R&amp;B or fan of Mariah.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|\\"Afterglow\\" was given to me from one of my amazon buddies. I will be forever grateful for his generous gift considering the awful week I just had at the office. At first, \\"Afterglow\\" didn't hit me right away. There were some good songs but nothing impressive. After listening to \\"Afterglow\\" several dozen times, I thought the album deserved a better rating because the more I listen to it, the more I love this cd. It has been six years since Sarah's last studio album \\"Surfacing\\". I liked that album but at times I found the album to be very sappy and drenched in oversentimentality. In other words, I got cavities from listening to songs like \\"I Love You\\" and \\"Angel\\". Nevertheless the album did not turn me off. I am still a big fan of Sarah McLachlan's music. Despite the lengthy hiatus, Sarah manages to sound like an angel. I was almost worried that \\"Afterglow\\" would be lyrically sappy like its predecessor but for me, the lyrics don't sound as wretchedly sappy on \\"Afterglow\\" despite what some critics might think. Listening to \\"Afterglow\\" is like slipping on an old pair of flannel pajamas that you haven't worn in awhile. At first it is a bit uncomfortable but the longer you wear it, the more comfortable it becomes. The same can be said about \\"Afterglow\\". At first, I wasn't sure what to make of the album but now that I am listening to the album again, the music slowly grew on me. Although \\"Afterglow\\" is not nearly as good as \\"Solace\\" or \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\", the songs on the entire album is still a welcome breeze for my ears. Knowing that I will be unemployed in a few days, I find the songs very comforting to listen to after spending 8 horrible hours at for the corporate monster I spent 3 years of my life at and sacrificing a lot of my time only to be rewarded with a pink slip. I was particularly affected by the songs \\"Drifiting\\" and \\"Push\\". I felt like I could relate to what Sarah is singing about in the songs. \\"Afterglow\\" may be slightly overpolished production-wise but the material is absolutely breathtaking. I do this is some of Sarah's best work so far.but the material is absolutely breathtaking. I do this is some of Sarah's best work so far.
B000002BQK|5.0|This CD is my favorite out of all Mariah's albums period. Butterfly wins, hands down! I got this during its release in '97 after buying her single &quot;honey&quot;. Butterfly still gets continuous spins in my CD player. Her voice just gets better and better as time goes on. Mariah can sing so well, and this album really shows it especially on songs like &quot;Butterfly,&quot; &quot;On The Outside,&quot; &quot;Whenever You Call,&quot; and &quot;I Give My All.&quot; Those are basically the highligths off the album. Least worth-listening to songs would have to be &quot;On The Rooftop,&quot; &quot;and &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; They just aren't that good or really worth listening to.<BR>The guy singing on &quot;The Beautiful 1's&quot; really ruins the song. Nevertheless, the album is still a must have! &quot;On The Outside&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; are her most personal songs on here, and very touching and heartfelt. Over and over again, I find solace in Mariah's music, I don't know what it is exactly but I guess it's just a compassion, an empathy in her voice that says to me &quot;It's alright, don't worry, i've been there too, you'll survive, you'll make it through the rain.&quot; Sometimes I feel as tho she's the only friend I have. Her music really lifts my spirit and adds joy to my life. If you don't already own this one, I highly recommend you make this your next buy! A must have for any music fan!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|has anyone else noticed that the majority of favorable reviews for this cd have spelling errors ? just wondering. anyways, i'm a nickelback fan, and i'm rather proud of that. in my opinion, nickelback is much more musically creative than most other bands out there. there are differences, both lyrically and instrumentally, in every song, yet there's still a distinctive sound that lets you know who you're listening to. metallica did something similarly (although not musically similar to nickelback, before i get hate mail and letter bombs), with the exception of st. anger, which sucks. and i'm also a huge metallica fan. okay, back on subject. silver side up is, without a doubt, my favorite album ever, and this one is a close second. it beats hanson, which i'm ashamed to admit that i not only listened to, but bought the cd. however, if what people think of what you listen to is all that important to you, then i suggest you don't buy any cd's...then you don't have to 'fess up to anything. you're the one out of 15 bucks, minimum, and that has to listen to the cd. buy what you like, and i recommend anything nickelback ! (or older metallica)
B000002AVF|5.0|This album Daydream is a must have! It's been in my collection since its release in '95. Mariah sings with real energy and emotion on each song. Some songs are happy tunes and others are sad ones revealing her sorrow. Happy, upbeat songs off the album are: &quot;Fantasy,&quot; &quot;Always Be My Baby,&quot; &quot;Fantasy (Sweet Dub Mix),&quot;  &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; (with Boyz II Men), &quot;Forever,&quot; and &quot;Slipping Away.&quot; Sad songs showing her sorrow and emotion include: &quot;When I Saw You,&quot; &quot;Melt Away,&quot; &quot;Looking In,&quot; and her version of &quot;Open Arms.&quot; This is by far, one of her best albums ever! This album is highly popular mainly because of the song &quot;Fantasy.&quot;  <BR>&quot;When I Saw You&quot; is probably the most heartfelt song here, just listening to it makes you want to cry. &quot;Fantasy&quot; would have to be the happiest song on here that is guaranteed to bring joy to anyone who's feeling down. &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot; is one of her most prettiest ballads, a song you'll find yourself listening to over and over and drifting away to it. &quot;Melt Away&quot; is also a beautiful ballad, and also a bit sad showing some real emotion in Mariah. This is a must have for any music fan of R&amp;B or any fan of Mariah Carey.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Dirty guitar, loose back beat, everything a Neil Young and Crazy Horse album should be.  I was hooked from the opening chord.  It just grooves into your bloodstream!
B000000H66|5.0|i first heard the album's title track playing insanely loud at at a local underground music store. i was too broke to buy the cd so the guy, a friend of mine, taped it for me. the tape was completely worn after about a week and the cd was too hard to find then, that it took me about a year to get it. after having it for more than 6 years now, i still play it at least once a month. entirely. all nine songs on it rule! my personal favorites after listening to it for a couple of thousand times, are: Symbolic, Zero tolerance, Sacred serenity, Crystal mountain and Perennial quest (this one has one of the most beautiful acoustic outros i've heard!). evenso, all songs of this album are killer.<br />i've heard &quot;leprosy&quot;,&quot;individual thought patterns&quot; &quot;overactive imagination&quot; and &quot;sounds of perseverance&quot; in addition to this one but &quot;symbolic&quot; still blows them all out of the water. i've heard a lot of good reviews about &quot;human&quot; but having not heard it before, i cant compare.<br />Chuck was a great composer; he wrote very good lyrics (even too good lyrics for a genre like death metal) and with his technical proficiency, helped keeping the genre entertaining, creative and worth checking out. if you're into extreme metal then this album is a must! it's still (IMO) superior to anything the gothenburg scene is putting out. that's how good it is. Enjoy (or should I say, Endure)!
B000002UB3|5.0|asked if abbey road ever came with printed lyrics-no,it never did,the only beatle albums that came with printed lyrics were Pepper,Magical mystery tour and the white album.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I have enjoyed Sarah's last four(counting this one) studio CDs.  I still play Fumbling and Surfacing quite a bit.<br />Afterglow goes in a different direction though it is still enjoyable.  The songs on this CD are very subdued by way of comparison.  You will find no \\"Possession\\", \\"Ice Cream\\", or \\"Sweet Surrender\\" among these songs.  If it was the songs with a groove or lighthearted in nature that you enjoyed, you will probably be disappointed with Afterglow.<br />That is not to say that Afterglow is bad.  Sarah's voice is still as melodic as it has ever been.  \\"Dirty Little Secret\\", \\"Push\\", and \\"Answer\\" are songs that make this very plain.  This CD is very pleasant and relaxing.<br />The only real knock I have on Afterglow is it is too short - especially considering how long it has been since Surfacing.  However, let's not be too harsh.  Sarah has a life outside of pleasing her fans that has involved a lot of change in recent years.  It is a testament to her artistry that we are left wanting more.
6301978587|5.0|A gem of a movie.  Someone should wake up already and release it on DVD!
B00005JM02|1.0|I had never seen this movie when it was out in theaters and my wife and I usually buy every Disney movie that comes out on DVD, so we bought it thinking it would be another cute entertaining movie like the rest. Oh boy were we wrong.<br />I cannot tell you how incredibly boring this movie was. I am normally a big Albert Brooks fan but his character voice over was annoying.  I fully anticipated Ellen's voice over to be annoying (she is annoying in real life). Every time she spoke I wanted some painkillers to ease the pain of the incredible headache it gave me (especially the whale imitation scene, yikes!)<br />The story was lacking, I didn't care about the characters. I was ready for the shark to come along and eat them all so the movie would be over.<br />Well, just like with Lord of the Rings, I am but one of about 10 people in the world that thought this movie was horrible. No shame in that, I actually like movies that have an engaging plot and interesting characters. Funny me I guess.
B00005JKC3|4.0|This is not your standard super-hero movie, so be warned. It's like King Kong and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde mixed together rather than a film like Spider-Man or Daredevil. In some ways, it's similar to the first Tim Burton Batman film as it's just as much about a warped relationship between the lead characters as it is about bringing a comic book character to life on the screen. If you want a by-the-numbers comic book movie, then you might be disappointed (but certainly not during the action scenes, which are awesome)...but if you approach this movie with an open mind, you may very well find yourself really appreciating this movie more than you would other standard \\"super-hero\\" films.<br />The editing is amazing in this film. This is probably the closest audiences will ever get to seeing a comic book \\"look\\" translated to the screen. The film attempts to mimic comic book-style framing and succeeds beyond all expectations. It's not confusing at all, and the filmmakers show an understanding of comic book storytelling and adapt it for the big screen flawlessly. The viewer is aware of the editing, but at no point does it derail the story that's being told, which is exactly the aim of the best creators in comics.<br />The CGI work is some of the best ever seen in movies. Not only does the Hulk look realistic and well integrated into the shots, but he also emerges as a character in his own right. The work done by ILM is groundbreaking stuff. <br />As for the performances, Eric Bana is fine as Bruce Banner as is Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. However, the two standout performances come from veteran actors Sam Elliot (one of my favourite actors...always dependable and likeable) as Betty's father, General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross and Nick Nolte in a larger-than-life performance as David Banner. Nolte has been criticised by some who say that he's overacting, but he's playing a guy who is a few sandwhiches short of a picnic basket even though he's a brilliant scientist. <br />As for the DVD presentation, I marked this down one star because of the extra features. It's not that what's on offer is not enjoyable, but when compared to what's found on other similar DVDs, this one could have been better. There are a number of featurettes, but the longest is 25 minutes (the Making Of documentary). The section about the comic book is the most disappointing. No Peter David, who wrote the book for many years and sent it sailing up the sales charts...just a predictable appearance creator Stan Lee. Surely other creators could have been interviewed...? After all, take a look at the similar and far superior comics documentary on the Daredevil DVD. A number of creators are interviewed and we see the evolution of the character throughout the years. The version on the Hulk DVD is little more than a brief overview that contains very little that is interesting or new. Some of the other featurettes repeat stuff like some comments from Danny Elfman and scenes of Ang Lee in his motion capture suit. There are very brief chats with the cast, and I would have liked to have seen more from them, particularly Eric Bana and Nick Nolte. It would've been great to have a cast commentary track, but we only get to hear Ang Lee who often pauses to let the action play out onscreen uninterrupted. Having said that, the extras that have been included are still a welcome addition to the DVD and are informative.<br />I thoroughly recommend purchasing this film on DVD. Great film, excellent video and audio transfer, decent extras...it's well worth adding to your DVD collection.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have seen, and I own both of the Lord of the Ring movies. These movies are the highlight of my day. If you want to see a movie that will move you, and keep you coming back for more, these are the movies for you. After the movies is finished, you won't be able to get them out of your head. You will become instantly addicted. That is how good these movies are. I am patiently waiting for the arrival of the third movie. You have to see it in theatres though, because you won't get the total effect of the movie if you don't.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|If you are a Gabriel fan, there is much to celebrate here, including a new tune that's a decent cast off for Gabriel. If you have wandered into Gabriel recently, this set will illuminate for you what a powerful writer he is on his best days, how intenseley and with no quarter asked or given, continues to attach the electrodes to the fragile primate inside us all and flip on the juice.<BR>Of course, and particularly with his middle period, it is tough to listen to these songs out of context. There was always something of a psychological milieu into which his songs were set, and so when you listen to this double hits set, you'll find yourself recalling what preceeded or followed songs from 3, SECURITY, SO. Personally, I wish he had included &quot;Mother of Violence&quot; from the otherwise shrill and forgettable 2 and &quot;And So It Begins...&quot; from THE LAST TEMPTATION soundtrack, but these are minor quibbles.<BR>Essentially this compilation gave Gabriel the opportunity to remaster what had always been, except for 2, remarkable recordings when they were initially released, and the new clean remasters are wonderful. What also emerges inadvertently from listening to this set is that there was at least 1 truly great album that could have been culled from OVO and UP. Again, merely speculatively interesting.<BR>Somewhere along the way, there is a live box set worth assembling of Gabriel's perfomances, perhaps a live DVD set, because it has always been the case with him that the records have paled in comparison to their live delivery, and his imagination seems to just expand exponentially when given a stage from which to launch his ideas, beginning with the winged mythology of &quot;Watcher&quot; through the NZ Spherically inclined child growing up. I'm sure it would be a hit.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Ordinary folks triumph in this quite pleasing look at big corporate greed and how the quest for the almighty dollar puts human life in the back seat.  Stellar performances from Roberts and the rest of the cast make this an affecting piece.<br />Very highly recommended!
B0000DJZA0|2.0|Coldplay just isn't a band that needs a live album.  No surprises here.  Every song is the same as it was recorded in the studio.  The DVD has great quality as far as picture and sound go, but the songs are a yawner...that makes the audio cd very boring.
B00000IQC8|3.0|This movie, though quite original, is difficult to watch more than twice.  It's full of teenage angst, which finds its outlet at the hands of unsuspecting customers.<br />The film suffers from fair-to-poor acting throughout and is highlighted by dialogue that's crude and that is geared to teens.<br />(...).
0679311718|5.0|This is an excellent, front line account of the events of, and leading to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.  It has been written from the perspective of the Canadian Lt.General Romeo Dallaire, the then Force Commander of the United Nations mission to Rwanda.<BR>Gen. Dallaire recounts the horrors, tragedies, and ineptness of the United nations during one of the worlds darkest hours.  His peacekeeping force was reduced to being bystanders in the slaughter that occured; 800 000 plus people were slaughtered systematically over a 100 day period.<BR>It would be helpful for the reader to have a background in the ethnic divide in Rwanda during the last century, although the subject is described in it's simplest terms in this book.<BR>This is a story of the struggle of humanity vs. politics, and how the former takes a backseat to the worlds dealings.  <BR>It is painful to read how the lives of individuals are reduced to dollar value in the united nations, but I think this is a work that everyone should read.  <BR>Genocide occurs in this modern world, and its clearly shown by General Dallaire that very few organizations and individuals are equipped, or care enough to deal with it.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|As has been said many times here already, this CD has been well worth the wait.  Sarah McLachlan has such a beautiful, unique voice and is an excellent musician and composer.  Her unique voice and style have allowed her to almost create for herself a genre of her own! ..  Fantastic album.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This is a great second album.  The Strokes have a sound all their own.  The trashing of this work of art hasn't happened yet but it will soon enough.  Just remember one thing - Velvet Underground was trashed because of the connection to Andy Warhol and the leg up it gave them in getting a record deal.  The Strokes have been trashed simply because the lead singer's father owns a modelling agency.  Much like the Velvet Underground, 30 or 40 years from now people will still be listening to and drawing musical inspiration from The Strokes.
B000068CNX|5.0|After a phenomenal debut season like Friends,most shows coast on it's success and start to slip in quality.But Friends would only get better with each successive season.<BR> Changes were in the air for the group.Joey joined the cast of Days Of Our Lives as the ill fated Dr.Drake Ramoray,we meet Phoebe's ex husband (Steve Zahn),Chandler gets a new roommate(Adam Goldberg)who turns out to be a psycho,and Monica falls in love with her dad's best friend Dr. Richard Burke(Tom Selleck).The seasons driving force is the beginning of the on/off again relationship between Rachel and Ross.<BR> Many classic episodes came from this season including The One where Heckles Dies,...the Baby on the Bus,...where Ross Finds Out,...the List,...where Ross and Rachel ... You Know,...where Dr. Ramoray Dies and ...Two Parties.<BR> But also from season two was The One With The Prom Video,considered the greatest Friends episode ever.Not only are we treated to a plot involving a hidious bracelet Joey gives to Chandler,but an old video of Rachel and Monica's prom.Giving a glimpse into to past at an overwieght Monica,a pre-nose job Rachel,and an extremely dorky Ross(\\"Looking Good Mr. Kotter).The most surprising moment is after viewing the video and Rachel seeing how much Ross really loved her,she finally kisses him(his Lobster) one of those special moments why Friends beloved by it's many fans.
1587990717|4.0|Taleb hammers home two or maybe three key ideas, padding them with an eclectic blend of autobiographical references and philosophical/literary yarns. When I put it down, I felt a little bit like I had just shared a brandy with a really smart guy who wanted to spend the evening talking about himself. Fortunately, it works because you get an unfettered (and not heavily filtered or re-edited) peek into a brilliant and well-read intellect. The best thing about Taleb, however in my opinion, is that he possesses that rare quality: he is an independent thinker. In fact, I view the book as having two underlying themes. One, it is a sort of a corny love letter to the massively underutilized science of statistics. I mean, the statistics discussed in the book are surprisingly basic but he reminds us that our everyday common sense doesn't really make sense. Two, it is an inspiring update of an ancient, heroic idea: that there is value to a thoughtful-even stoic-detachment in a world filled with noise and distraction. <br />The big ideas are simple. The usefulness of the book is that he shows you how we generally do not behave as if the simple ideas are true. The biggest idea is survivorship bias. It explains why my book reviews tend to be positive. I generally do not post a review unless I've read the entire book, and I tend to quit books that I don't like. So, my reviews are based on a sample that is infected by survivorship bias. I won't go into the other ideas (i.e., the problem of induction and \\"our genetic unfitness in the world\\") except to say that (i) the induction issue is arguably an extension of survivorship bias, so you may feel déjà vu here and (ii) the last section on the \\"human aspect of uncertainty\\" is the weakest section. This section really needs an editor to impose an organizing principle, and except for the touching, instructive conclusion, I thought is was one digression after another.<br />Don't expect any math or real depth in the statistics (an endorsing professor on the back cover says the book is \\"mathematically sound and...renders mathematics exciting for non-specialists.\\" Deceptive endorsements are grating. There isn't any math in this book, to speak of!). However, the idea of survivorship is important enough to warrant a sincere recommendation of this book. How many books give you even a single idea that you can use forever? And, again, Taleb is very entertaining. I almost fell off my chair laughing when he recalls one the weekly meetings at an investment house, with economic strategists making all sorts of announcements and the rhetoric flying. He is so put off that he resorts to speaking a lot in hopes that he won't be invited back. Someone asks if he is bullish or bearish on the market, and he responds that he doesn't understand these words \\"outside of the their purely zoological consideration.\\"
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I don't understand why Gabriel seems to be trying to forget his second solo album.  I, for one, think that its a great album with alot of great songs.  If the issue is regarding the vastly different production values, why not do a remix or a remake like he did with &quot;Here Comes The Flood&quot; and &quot;I Have The Touch&quot; on Shaking the Tree?  I'd love to hear a new version of &quot;White Shadow&quot;, or maybe &quot;Mother of Violence&quot;.  These and many other great songs are going completely unnoticed, and it's quite unfortunate, cuz they really are great songs.<br />  Despite that, i suppose &quot;Hit&quot; is still a pretty solid compilation and a good introduction into the glorious world of this man's genius.
B0000004UB|5.0|Comparing Samantha Fox's sophomore release to her debut is like comparing almond whirl to raspberry ripple ice cream-two totally different flavours.  The majority of the tracks was produced by Steve Lovell and Steve Power, and with the exception of two tracks, showed Foxy moving more towards a pure pop direction, ditching the rebellious slamming rock-keyboards from Touch Me in the dustbin.<br />Yet there's a final bow at the latter style, from the second single, \\"I Surrender (To The Spirit Of The Night)\\", whose guitars and keyboards, thumping drums, and rhythm mimic \\"Touch Me\\".  I can imagine that this or the \\"Touch me\\" song were candidates for Foxy's breakout single and \\"I Surrender\\" lost the coin toss.  There's still a lot of energy in this number though.<br />\\"I Promise You\\" demonstrates Foxy's shift to really skippy bubblegum pop and not necessarily the S-A-W type, although she does dip her toe in that on one song.  Lovell and Power's production is just as infectious and the chorus has a tempo and intensity to match.<br />Then comes \\"Naughty Girls (Need Love Too), her second big hit in the US--where she dips her toe in the 80's hip-hop of Full Force, who helped out Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam.  She would do some more of this in I Wanna Have Some Fun.<br />\\"True Devotion\\" sports the same synths and haunting atmospheric sounds as the Cars' \\"Drive\\", and I often compare the two.  There's a cogent comparison in this line:  \\"Yesterday's dreams like old magazines/they lie beside the bed.\\"  She can handle ballads well enough, with the limited depth of her voice.<br />Whether one will like her slowed down version of the Stones' \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\", with backing soulful vocals and some grinding guitars and funky synths will depend on if one is a Stones fan first.  I like the original better, but I can handle Foxy's one as well.  Now Britney's version...that's something else, but let's leave that note unopened.<br />\\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now\\" has Foxy opening a pack of Stock-Aitken-Waterman's bubblegum, and she blows Bananarama-sized bubbles with it, not as big as \\"Venus\\", more like \\"I Heard A Rumour.\\"<br />Thanks to \\"If Music Be The Food Of Love\\", I've referred to the Bard as Willie The Shake in this playful song that injects well-known quotes from Shakie's plays.

Yes, \\"One night in Dream City/it's unkind, it's unreal.\\"<br />Another haunting ballad, \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\", which aptly describes her next album...(but not the fourth one).

6305513406|2.0|First off I can't believe Paramount will not make box sets of the original series.  I take points of this review for that.  plus their is no retrospectives, documentaries, audio commentary.<BR>I give the remastered sound an A+ and the remastered picture an A+.  But as previous customers have said two episodes per disc is not exceptable.  They are too expensive.  You can get all seven seasons of next generation, for less than buying each of these original series dvd's separetely for only three seasons.  Even the sci-fi network was able to get nimoy and shatner to do interviews for their &quot;Star Trek special Edition&quot;, the first time it was aired remastered and uncut.

0142000663|5.0|It seems to me that whenever I come across a review on this website titled \\"An honest student's review\\" or something along those lines, the sentances \\"This book was so boring\\",\\"I was forced to read it\\" and \\"I can't beleive this is considered a classic\\" always pop up, with \\"If I could give this zero stars I would\\" always present at the end of the review.  I, however, although a student and \\"forced\\" to read this book, beleive this novel, by John Steinbeck, to be a true classic of American literature.  There are many other reviews below that give a far more indepth plot summary, so I will keep that portion of the reveiw succinct.  The Joad family, suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, strap as many of their possesions as they can to their car and head west to the purported paradise of California.  However, they find their paradise to be little more than a dystopia, run by the few plutocrats who have managed to stay afloat in the depression by standing on the shoulders of those below them.  Steinbeck is nothing short of a master here, splicing \\"intercalaries\\" of heartbreaking human suffering into the Joad's comparable tale of woe and misery.  This juxtaposition shows the extent of which the poverty and despair has blighted half a nation of farmers.<br />Anyone who wishes to truly understand the human condition, its depths and its misery, should read this book.  However, it should be noted that anyone looking for an uplifting tale of human tenacity should perhaps look elsewhere, for this novel is unrelenting in its depiction of destruction and despair.<br /><br />If I could give it 10 stars I would
0743244249|2.0|I went to see DeLillo read from this at the Steppenwolf in Chicago and left half way through.  A friend who had attended the reading with me had bought a copy of the book.  He read it then passed it on to me.  I thought I'd try to read because I've like DeLillo's earlier books (except End Zone).  <br />The characters don't interest me, they're flat.  All in all, the book has the quality of a take myself too seriously TV series and a shock-fest like American Psycho.  This one seems to borrow too much from the saccharine world of Bret Easton Ellis but I don't think that DeLillo really lives in this kind of world (thank heaven's for that).  Easton's work is overwrought and it seems as of late that he's written himself out.  Compared to other DeLillo works, this is lackluster.  He's such a fantastic writer, the sentences he contructs are fantastic.  Such a shame to waste that talent on a tale such as this.
0920668372|4.0|I don't think this story is creepy. The story IS fictional.  I don't see how it's different from ficitonal books about trains, cars, animals, etc. that talk and /or solve problems.  It's about unconditional love between a mother and child.  The first time I read it I cried.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is a gritty portayal of the senseless violence of war.  The sotry takes place during the ill-fated Somalia campaign of the 90's.  During the campaign to capture Somalian warlord Aidid, two helicopters go down.  American Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers attempt a rescue, but are repulsed by hordes of Somalian militiamen.  The movie follows the trials of the conflict.<br />I was really impressed with the reality of the battle scenes.  You'll feel like you're in the middle of the action.  After see this, you'll really respect what soldiers have to go through in the field.  However after the casualties start mounting up, you get get a feeling that all these deaths are a waste--lives lost to poor planning and policy.  I hope that we think more carefully about war befire we send our soldiers to face such a hell on earth.  Check out this movie, you won't regret it.<br />One caution--this film contains graphic displays of violence, so if you're sensitive to such scenes, you may be in for a rude shock.
B000002BQK|4.0|I just heard this cd. And its good, it was her most open and the real Mariah (she claims), Now that I think about it this set was Mariahs last #1 album that was in 1997 that was 6 years ago.But debuted at #1 and sold 5 million copies in th U.S.   Also the last time she actually sings her best. But her best albums are music box and daydream pick those up better. The best track here is Breakdown....
0425098478|4.0|This Johnson/Blanchard collaboration is one of the most synergistic and powerful of the Blanchard stable of management books.<br />The principles are simple and may come across as intuitively obvious for most seasoned managers looking for motivational techniques for their charges. However, these time-tested techniques of appropriate praising and reprimands are often not applied in a timely enough fashion to achieve their maximal effect on staff and colleagues. As a result, managers sometimes wonder why their efforts fall short of producing tangible results.<br />The authors seek to provide the Whys to the application of these techniques. This serves as powerful reminder to managers that although there is a price to pay in order to be a One-Minute Manager, there is a bigger price to pay if we do not become One-Minute Managers. The bigger price of course is the loss of the privilege to manage talents under our charge.<br />This book deserves 4 stars for its creative, succinct parable-led coaching style which has served the readers well. It is true to its title of One Minute - Short, straight to the point, immediately applicable.
0452282152|5.0|I first read this in a book club in highschool two years ago.  It is a wonderful book, exploring not only the historical aspects of Vermeer's life and times but also delving into the strange relationship with his servant/model.  It is an excellent exploration of the social classes-master and servant-as well as personal relationships.  I highly recommend this book.  Another recommendation would be the Red Tent, though I have forgotten the author's name.
B00005RDSM|5.0|I love this movie, as I do all the earlier Disney animations.  I read the review by Carolinapooh, and I, too, remember that the part about clapping to keep Tinkerbell alive was in the movie!   If you watch it, you will see Tinkerbell fading, and then there is an abrupt cut and suddenly she's OK.  Why would they have taken it out? Maybe they think kids today are just too sophisticated for that, and sadly, they may be right.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Quite simply, films do not get better than this.  As a die-hard fan of the Matrix trilogy, it was of course my prerogative to enjoy this film.  However, my father, whom I saw Revolutions with, also enjoyed this film.<BR>First off, the acting.  While many say that Keanu Reeves is not, despite the incredible movies he stars in, a good actor.  Lies!  He gives a performance of a lifetime in Revolutions.  His acting abilities alone would make me want to see this movie more that five times.  Coupling that with the enchanting performances given by Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Jada Pinkett-Smith, you have an acting combination that would make any film wonderful.<BR>But that is not all, no! that is not all.  The soundtrack adds a depth and flavor to the film that ties everything together and makes the drama so much more, well, dramatic.  This film would not have been complete without the angelic voices singing in the background while Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Smith (Hugo Weaving) battle it out in their final confrontation.<BR>Finally, the plot provided the perfect finisher to an incredible series.  I don't wish to reveal anything to anyone who has yet to see the movie, but suffice to say that everything is tied up perfectly with just enough doubt to let the moviegoer use their own imagination.<BR>This film will be wonderful for romantics and sci-fi geeks alike.  So bring the kids!  Bring the neighbors!  Bring your aunt Sally!  Whoever you take with you, they are bound to enjoy the final chapter of the Matrix saga: Matrix Revolutions.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I just want to tell you to ignore the critics and go see this movie. I went with two friends and all three of us loved it! We even want to go back and see it again. I liked it better than Reloaded. When I left the theater I just thought to myself, \\"Wow!\\"<BR>   Keep an eye out for the theme of \\"Balance\\" in the movie. Without going too far out on a limb, I'd say there are even elements of Kabbalah and Tantric philosophy running through this film---the theme of male/female polarities and maintaining a universal whole through the \\"balancing of equations.\\" The action scenes were terrific and you'll never be bored---there's always something to keep your attention. The final fight scene between Neo and Smith is incredible (there's even a catchy choral piece akin to Duel of the Fates\\"). If you liked Matrix at all(...)
B00005JMFR|3.0|The third and final chapter. But after i saw it, i felt there should be a fourth. Why? Because the third didn't wrap up all the questions everyone has about the matrix, but in fact, created more. Also the lack of time \\"in the matrix\\" kicking butt and fighting agents was a factor in the bad column for this movie. I don't want to give too much away, but here it is broken down easily. Beginning-in matrix, neo-middle machine war- end-neo and smith. You barely see neo and trinity in the movie , but instead watch a ton of special FX for an hour and a half in the middle of the movie. The end shall confuse you and leave you wanting to know more, but there is no more, it is inevitable, everything that has a beginning has an end. And this end was too bland for me.
B0000B3FCX|3.0|I am largely writing this review in response to some of the incredibly ignorant reviews i've read here (you know who you are). There are many different kinds of music because people like different things, and that is good. What a boring, unstimulating world this would be if we all liked the same thing as &quot;Mike&quot; suggests we should do. Clue to you Mike, they are still playing Journey, Foreigner, Styx and REO Speedwagon on the radio. Many songs by these artists are known as classics...can you say c-l-a-s-s-i-c-s? As far as this album goes, no, this is not my favorite album of all time. I've only rated it a three, middle of the road. Chad Kroeger has an excellent voice and a lot of talent. His band is clearly made up of skilled musicians.  There are some good songs on this album and one or two very good ones.  Though this isn't their best effort to date, I'm sure the many Nickelback fans will look forward to hearing whatever they come out with next. Whatever your taste in music; Flaming Lips, Metallica, Journey or even Dolly Parton, keep listening to the stuff you love and enjoy. <BR>Side note to &quot;lady&quot;, the perfect speller..... &quot;anyways&quot; is not a word, i believe you meant &quot;anyway&quot;.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I rarely buy CD's but after seeing this wonder on VH1 - I tripped over myself to purchase it. Steve Wonder and Billy Joel in a package dripping with talent and verve. So where's the DVD? Bravo.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The first Matrix movie was ground breaking, so naturally the expectations were huge when Matrix Reloaded came out.<br />As a whole, Matrix Reloaded does not disappoint.  There are a few parts that are kind of slow, but once the action kicks in, you will wonder when you will get a chance to breathe!  This movie has some of the most incredible action and special effects that I have seen in a long time.<br />The DVD was highly enjoyable, the picture is pristine and the sound was awesome when played through my Dolby 5.1 surround sound system.<br />This is one of the best DVD's I have purchased in 2003, and recommend getting this one today!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I have been anxiously awaiting a new album from Sarah...but I could have waited longer if it meant a better effort from one of my fav artists. &quot;Afterglow&quot;is good, but nothing special. There really wasn't anything about it that grabbed my attention. The vocals are in the characteristically wispy, dreamy tone, but most of the songs end up sounding the same. The lyrics are all wonderful, as to be expected from Sarah, but all the songs have the same tempo and feel. The best are &quot;World on Fire&quot; and &quot;Time.&quot; I was hoping to hear more progression from Sarah as a singer. She made very audible growth from &quot;Fumbling Toward Ecstasy&quot; to &quot;Surfacing,&quot; but on &quot;Afterglow&quot; she seems to digress back to the sounds of her older albums like &quot;Solace&quot; and &quot;Touch.&quot; The main thing I like about her past albums is her exploration of her deeper thoughts/feelings. There was always a sense of vulnerability, sensuality, and honesty in both the lyrics and music. She doesn't seem to dig as deep for &quot;Afterglow.&quot; There isn't really anything bad about this album, but there isn't anything remarkable about it either. It definitely won't spend much time in my music rotation.
0385504209|3.0|Yes, &quot;The Code&quot; is inventive.  Yes, it is fast-paced.  Yes, it goes on &amp; on, twisting &amp; turning with a new old twist around every corner.  This is a summer read, not a read that breaks new ground.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential<br />Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce look like young men in their early 20's in this film, although their roles specify them in their 30's. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce claim to fame has to be this film. It has all you want in a police thriller. I give this film a flat out 5 stars. I recommend this film to everyone.
B000002GQG|5.0|Released during a period of rock `n roll psychodelia, this is arguable the Moody Blues most productive and progressive album of the times.  Nearly half the songs are still part of their concert listing.  \\"Departure\\" is another trademark introduction that has been the motif of so many of their albums - a unique and mind-blowing beginning.  Highlights include Lodge's \\"Ride My See-Saw\\", a concert closing song, while \\"Dr. Livingstone\\" and \\"Legend Of A Mind\\" are still classics that can be heard on the radio almost as much as \\"Nights In White Satin\\".  \\"House Of Four Doors (Part 1 and 2)\\" provide continuity to the collection and scores of special effects.  An earmark of the period is produced with \\"The Word\\" followed by \\"Om\\", the only songs that seem dated.  Two of the Moody Blues best and most romantic songs are Hayward's \\"The Actor\\", a truly unique and inventive ballad and \\"Voices In The Sky\\".  They are both performed and sung beautifully in concert.  Other than \\"Days Of Future Passed\\", this is one of their most popular albums from that period.  Plus, just take a look at that cover!
B000066AXE|5.0|Goddamn it, Russell Crowe is such an amazing beautiful actor, he should be making movies full-time. MORE RUSSELL CROWE FILMS!
0385504209|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and was quite happy to do so.  I love to ready about conspiracies and alternate views.  I have no concerns about the author's research.  Truthfully, I don't care.  It's fiction, people.  The author claims that some things are factual.  Ok, I understand that.  The rest is fiction.<br />I think the book offers a lot of food for thought.  That's how I consider what's a good read.  If it makes me think and ask questions, I think the author did a good job.  I don't consider this book to bash anyone's religion.  However, that won't stop those overly sensitive zealots out there from shrieking in offense.  Do I believe everything the authors states and theorizes?  No, because I understand that it's fiction.

0060934719|5.0|I picked up Stardust by Neil Gaiman on November 1st 2003 and I completed today - the 6th of November 2003 and it was an amazing read. Light and fluffy in places, but then again I loved it to the word GO!!<br />What is it about? It's about finding your Heart's Desire and this is exactly what Tristan Thorn sets out to do when his lady love Victoria Forester asks him to get the falling star they see together one night. They all live in a place called The Wall - and beyond it is what is known as the Faerie land - no one ever speaks about it and is forbidden to go there as well. And this is where the star fell...<br />What I loved about this book is the simplicity in which Mr.Gaiman has expressed his ideas and thoughts. There are times when you want to fling a book across the table and never open it for its sheer complex language - but this one is far beyond that reaction. Its about witches, fairies, about spells, about thrones and the fight for the same, its about destinies and above all - realizing that life isn't always what it seems to be...<br />It was a heart-warming experience for me reading this one. Thanks Gaiman.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I cannot say much more than has already been said; nevertheless, this is an absolutely magnificent score (to an equally magnificent film).  Howard Shore has done a beautiful thing by composing the music to Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece.  The theme for Rohan is bittersweetly noble, and \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" is one of the most passionate compositions I have heard in quite some time - my heart stirs every time I hear it.  The entire soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own - it is truly difficult to choose just a few select tracks to praise.<br />Overall, this is a gorgeous soundtrack, one everyone should own.  No bland repetition or copycatting here - Shore has captured the spirit of the films AND books.
0780020685|4.0|To get this out of the way right now, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, as a film, is a 5-star picture. Provided the audience has an inkling of what they're getting into, this movie can be easily considered one of Akira Kurosawa's best efforts. The expert directing, multi-layered story, and mounds of social commentary make for a film that sits up there with &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; at the top of many critic's &quot;top 10&quot; lists. It's a truly outstanding film, and one that holds up to many repeat viewings and careful analysis.<br />As an aside, this movie will be quite lost on those raised on modern-day Hollywood films. Anyone going into it expecting a shallow, sword-swinging thrill ride will come away confused (and probably angry) at the &quot;slow&quot; pace, the three-hour runtime, the subtitles, the fact that it's in black and white, the fact that it's not particularly violent, the fact that they talk so much, etc. etc. ad nauseam. I'd figure this would go without saying, but there it is again, just in case: If your idea of a fantastic movie is &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, run away right now; what you're looking at now is the movie version of Kryptonite.<br />Assuming the audience has some depth perception, this becomes THE film to own, and should be a cornerstone in any great DVD collection. Fans will recognize the label of the famous Criterion Collection displayed proudly across the disc case, and under normal circumstances that's indicative of a DVD packed to the gills with extras for the real film fan. The only issue with this disc (and hence the 4-star rating) is that the DVD is VERY slight on the extras, essentially giving you the film and that's it. <br />Normally, this wouldn't be worth docking a point, given that this is both a very early DVD, and also given that this is the only place to get the genuine, 3+ hour Japanese version of the film. When it was picked up by RKO for it's first U.S. release decades ago, the film had been greatly reduced in length, and there have been various other cuts throughout the years. This version is easily the most complete, and that alone is quite substantial.<br />In all honesty, it's BECAUSE of the importance of the film that I feel like I got a little cheated with this disc. Were this a film of any lower calibur, I think I'd be fine, but this is SEVEN-FREAKING-SAMURAI we're talking about! If you're a Kurosawa fan, you really, really want to get as much as possible out of this film. As it stands, a real fan is forced to go to external sources on the film (not hard to find) to get all the juicy extra information that compliments it, which really isn't so bad, but the thought of what could have been had this film been released a year or two later on DVD makes me winsome.<br />What's crucial to point out, however, is that this shortcoming is really in no way the fault of Criterion, who have always had the utmost respect for the films they produce. It's much more a time factor: This is disc #2 in the collection (they're well beyond #200 by this point) and at the time, the special editions as we know them did not exist. Packing the entire film onto a single disc was a feat in and of itself, and taking into account where the technology was at the time, this really is the best the fans could have hoped for: Seven Samurai, uncut, looking and sounding as good as it was ever going to.<br />So, think of the 4-star rating as a time-adjusted thing. This movie is still required, but know what you're getting so there's no dissapointment.<br />And Kurosawa fans, take heart: Criterion's putting out a fantastic-looking version of &quot;Ikiru&quot;, which is arguably the best Kurosawa film ever, and they're bringing all the fans' expecations to bear. It looks like it's going to be perfect.<br />In the meantime, Seven Samurai is a no-brainer for any film fan. <br />It's an honest-to-God classic, and one of the best films ever made.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|The soundtrack to Disney's summer hit &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; is absolutely wonderful (even if you haven't seen the movie).  In fact, Badelt's score could potentially steal the show because of its depth and spirit. <br />I absolutely adore this soundtrack, and have only one complaint - it isn't long enough!  Yet the score you'll hear is absolutely worth the price of admission, which is something one cannot say about many film scores.  This CD is a wonderful addition to anyone's music collection, regardless of genre.
B00005JMFR|1.0|i love this movie so much. this is the greatest movie of 2003 and the best of the matrix trilogy. the story goes like this ( warning spoilers ahead)neo lives in the matrix but he wants to lead humanity to a better place so he has to battle these machines that look like people. the fight scenes were so exciting that i was on the edge of my seat. the special effects are absolutly breathtaking. the wachowski brothers are officialy geniouses. I cant wait for part 4. make sure to buy matrix pt2 ( its out on dvd right now!) and watch it first so that you can follow the story because it is very deep then Do yourself a favor and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have been a fan of Sarah McLachlan for years, having seen her in concert and at Lillith Fair with my daughter. It has been difficult to go so long without a new album, but the wait was worth it.  I love every album she has made, but her writing on &quot;Afterglow&quot; may be the best ever, especially lyrically.  &quot;Fallen&quot; was an instant favorite, &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; is great, as is &quot;World on Fire&quot;; but if I had to pick a favorite, I have to say it is &quot;Answer&quot;. I believe that may be the most beautiful song ever written by Sarah McLachlan. I am mesmerized by this album and recommend it highly.
B00005JMFR|4.0|The action sequences and graphic effects in The Matrix Revolutions were good but not path-breaking - among others, the previous Matrixes, Lord of the Rings, and The Star Wars prequels have already done it. Other movie formula ingredients - comedy, romance, tragedy, drama (also know as inter-personnel relationships) - are all present to various extents. Like any commercial movie, many questions are left deliberately unanswered, leaving open the possibility for sequels and prequels. Down one star.<br />Humor is certainly present in Revolutions, though not very much and not often obvious. For one that is (or should be) obvious, watch when Neo's punch to Agent Smith is caught close-up in slow motion, Rocky fashion. In Rocky (and Raging Bull), you see one boxer's glove smashing into the other's chin in slow motion, the jaw distorting, sweat and blood flying. You get the adrenalin rush as you feel the impact on your own fist (or your jaw, depending on your imagination). In Revolutions, Smith's face contorts in slow motion - itself a funny sight. Then Smith's head moves away from Neo's fist, revealing four knuckles briefly imprinted on the cheek from the impact. Hilarious.<br />But it is in philosophy where, in my opinion, Revolutions really scores. <br />I collect pop philosophy in short pithy sentences. Ancient Vedic philosophy from India is great at this: \\"I am the Ultimate Reality,\\" \\"You are That (Ultimate Reality),\\" \\"There's one Truth, but the wise call it by different names\\" and so on.<br />The Matrix Revolutions, which shows the influence of the Vedas in many places, has a few gems of its own to add (though not necessarily original), like \\"Everything that has a beginning has an end\\" and \\"Cookies, like everything else, need a lot of love and affection.\\" <br />It explains the ancient Vedic concept of Karma - the law of actions and results - in two short dialogues: \\"Cause-Effect and Action-Consequences as opposed to Chance or Coincidence\\" and \\"What Love and Karma meanto a Computer Program.\\"<br />The meaning of life and purpose of existence is hinted at by statements that are obviously supposed to be the opposite, because they are made by Agent Smith - an obvious villain - and by good people sunk in despair or hopelessness.<br />Mercifully, none of the philosophizing was as long as some of the painful discourses in the previous movie, The Matrix Reloaded. <br />As a suitable finale, the lyrics of the song that played during the credits are in Sanskrit:<BR>    \\"Asato maa sad gamaya. Tamaso maa jyotir gamaya. Mrityor maa amritan gamaya\\"<BR>They are from the Vedas, and mean \\"Take me from falsehood (or unreal) to the truth (or reality), from darkness to light, from death to immortality.\\"<br />As they say in Hindi to the whole concept of the universe, \\"Sab Maya Hai\\" - Everything is an Illusion - like the Matrix.
B00008IAMD|5.0|The commentary of one of the few American prophets on St. John's Book of Revelations... simply the work of utterance.  Amidst the pablum that is coming from most pulpits these days, Cash dares to declare that &quot;not all will be treated just the same.&quot;  Perhaps one might dare to actually fear the one who cannot only kill the body, but kill the body and afterwards assign to Gehenna.  Listen to Cash, but look over your shoulder for the Four Horsemen.
0446310786|5.0|Atticus Finch, Boo Radley, Maycomb - names that resonate even before reading the book. I can't believe that it's taken me so long to get around to reading this - it truly is a classic that deserves to be read, that's enjoyable and is still an easy read.<br />&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in the deep South during the depression. Told from the viewpoint of Scout Finch, a young tomboy growing up in Maycomb, Alabama, we get an account of her early life full of strange characters such as the enigmatic Boo Radley, woven with a classic courtroom drama equal to any that Grisham or Turow have produced.<br />Harper Lee has breathed such life and vitality into every character in this tale. Jem and Scout, the son and daughter of Atticus Finch a local lawyer and state senator, represent the liberal town viewpoint, the growing awareness of racial inequality and the touchpoint for the tensions of country versus town that appear even within the school. Aunt Alexandra gives us an insight into the southern hostess, gentile yet savage, forward thinking when it comes to Africa highlighting the racial inequalities they take for granted in their own town.<br />This book was written at the beginning of the highly charged atmosphere of the late 50s, early 60s. Racial inequality was being challenged in the courts, in the schools and on the streets. The combination of this intensity combined with the drama set in 1930s makes this one of the true classics of American life in the South. It is an interesting read whatever your background and I highly recommend reading it sooner rather than later!
B0000026UV|5.0|Two generations of leading and groundbreaking guitarists combined their efforts into this precious and timeless piece of wonderful music. Chet Atkins, one of the most important and respectable of country musicians, and a pioneer of the electric guitar; and Mark Knopfler, Dire Straits frontman and a man clearly in touch with the country roots of rock music - go from straight country to mood instrumentals to rock n' roll, all infused with some of the finest pickin' I've ever heard and always having lots of fun. Knopfler's production (he had produced most of his releases since 1980's Dire Straits album `Making Movies') clearly shows in the beautiful and light-hearted sound, but the arrangements and recordings are pretty basic. The whole thing mainly revolves around two guitars, with just a hint of a rhythm section and some strings on a couple of songs.<br />This cleverly titled album has the strength to appeal to almost every listener. And not only is it a fantastic start for a rock lover for learning to appreciate the roots of rock n' roll, it's also one of the finest country albums around. Straight country songs like `Poor Boy Blues', `Just One Time' and `The Next Time I'm In Town' are performed wonderfully and Mark and Chet's arrangements are sublime. Other tracks stand out though: `Tahitian Skies' is a beautiful instrumental take on Mark's 1985 classic `Why Worry', which outshines the original incredibly. `Tears' and `Sweet Dreams' are also wonderful instrumentals which give Mark and Chet a chance to show how well they work together. More energetic is the rockabilly number `Yakety Axe' - a take on Boots Randolph's 1963 instrumental `Yakety Sax' - on which Chet shines amazingly, and which has terrific guitar work from both. Finally, my favorite - `There'll Be Some Changes Made' - an adaptation of an old Benny Goodman song (at least he performed it; I have no idea if his performance was even the original). Mark and Chet wrote new lyrics for the song, turning it into Chet singing about wanting to go with the times and become a rocker, and Mark trying to turn him away. The dialogue between the two takes place in two dimensions - vocally and on guitar, and makes it the funniest as well as the most clever song on the album. Mark and Chet really had a ball on this one, improvising most of the dialogue as well as the solos (\\"Not bad, but you're not Mark Knopfler...\\" \\"Don't make me look bad now, respect for your elders...\\"). The solos challenge each other and intertwine beautifully to make the song a treat.<br />`Neck &amp; Neck' is one of the most wonderful purchases for lovers of this lovely instrument. If you're an Atkins fan, you won't be disappointed; and if you're only in it for Knopfler and only vaguely know Atkins's name, you're in for a lovely surprise. And if you're as snooty about country music as I was before I heard this album, don't forget where rock comes from, and don't forget where everything about Knopfler and Dire Straits comes from.

Mandatory listening.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|If you liked the first album, you'll like the new one.  That's because the new one almost sounds like outtakes from the first album.  <br />I wondered how the Strokes could follow up on their debut dose of furiously played melodic punk, with its perfect balance of rawness and musicality.  I wondered if it might be best to just break up like the Sex Pistols did.  Well, the Strokes figured out how to follow up their first album.  They repeated it!<br />Everyone who enjoyed \\"Is This It?\\" will enjoy this album, but you might find yourself asking . . . . well, is this it?  Did they need two years to make what sounds like something they could have rattled off six to eight months after the last record?<br />This is truly a fun record, but the Strokes will have to figure out what to do next before album three.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Man, at one point in this movie i felt like i was watching a futuristic version of the Return of the King.  Frodo--err Neo and his companion venture to the heart of darkness alone, whilst the remaining forces of man battle the impossible army of the machines--err Sauron?  All in all a very entertaining movie, but the over-over dramatic tete-a-tetes became tired even in Reloaded, and most of the acting was 2nd-rate in my opinion.  Even the choral doom-laden soundtrack became too much in the end.
B00005JMFR|1.0|This movie is terrible. Don't even bother with it. The trilogy fell flatter than a corn flake. It goes to show you that special effects don't make a movie. After watching this ..., it made want to install mechwarrior on my computer and take control of the action rather than sit stupid and act intelligent trying to decipher the \\"riddles\\" in the show. The only riddle unansewered for me is, What were they thinking?...
B00006LLLN|5.0|This is the best live cd I have ever heard.  First and foremost, the musicianship displayed by Alison Krauss and Union Station on this cd is so good it made me want to cry! Second, the quality of the recording is fantastic. I could barely tell it was a live recording.  Third, you NEED to buy this cd RIGHT NOW! It's too good to pass up!
B0000VD04M|5.0|Touchstone has released the technical details on the director's cut for one of my favorite movies ever (that's right, \\"Director's Cut\\")! Here they are:<br />- Anamorphic Widescreen Presentation<br />- English Dolby Digital 5.1 Track<br />- Audio Commentary with Tim Burton, Martin Landau and Technical Crew<br />- Let's Shoot This! (Making Of) Documentary<br />- The Theremin (Film Score) Featurette<br />- Making Bela (Make-Up) Featurette<br />- When Carol Met Larry (Cross Dressing) Featurette<br />- Pie Plates Over Hollywood (Visual World of Ed Wood) Featurette<br />- Original Music Video Co-Directed By Tim Burton<br />- Original Theatrical Trailer<br />As I've already stated, this is probably one of my favorite films ever made and after a long wait, it's reassuring to see they're finally going to release Tim Burton's masterpiece on DVD. Why us folks in the states have had to wait so long is beyond me.<br />This movie is hilarious and inspiring and in fact inspired me to want to become a film-maker. The black and white is perfect for this film, Martin Landua and Johnny Depp give great performances, some scenes are just flat-out hilarious.<br />I encourage everybody to go out and grab this movie when it comes out (or do like me, and pre-order it). I've yet to meet a person who has watched this film and not like it!
B000002MU3|4.0|Yes, Monster is different from Out of Time and Automatic for the People.  It's also pretty freakin' good standing on its own.  Much has been written on the album's similarities to the grunge sound of bands like Nirvana.  I can hear a resemblance on a few tracks, but don't go thinking this is another Nirvana knock-off.  Behind the dirty guitar riffs, this is unmistakeably R.E.M.<br />&quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; and &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot; are a pair of swaggering rockers to start the album; both feature great distorted guitar solos from Peter Buck.  I liked &quot;King of Comedy&quot; at first, but it has since grown repetitive.  The first lousy song is &quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream,&quot; but it's short enough to warrant a listen.  We have the punchy little rocker &quot;Star 69&quot; before reaching &quot;Strange Currencies.&quot;  Yes, it does sound like a particular ballad off Automatic, yet it somehow manages to take on a life of its own.  Stipe turns in an excellent vocal performance and everyone else in the band is top-notch here.  &quot;Tongue&quot; is a slow piano-based ballad with another excellent (albeit brief) Buck solo.  &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; is the album's centerpiece.  It has a vivid atmosphere of complete rejection, sounding like a cross-breed of Nirvana's &quot;Lithium&quot; and the band's own &quot;Losing My Religion.&quot;  At least that's what it reminds me of.  &quot;I Took Your Name&quot; is another clunker that I can tolerate for a minute or so before skipping to &quot;Let Me In&quot;.  &quot;Let Me In&quot; seems like complete white noise at first, yet repeated listenings unveil the beauty within Stipe's eulogy for Kurt Cobain.  The album ends with two decent tunes, &quot;Circus Envy&quot; and &quot;You&quot;.<br />The overall verdict?  Monster has a handful of weak songs, but the greats (&quot;Crush with Eyeliner,&quot; &quot;Strange Currencies,&quot; &quot;Bang and Blame,&quot; &quot;Let Me In&quot;) certainly makethe album worth it.
0780624890|5.0|Vampirism, since the time Bram Stoker penned his classic, has gone through innumerable incarnations. Whether it be in the form of teenage angst in the mid 80s flick \\"The Lost Boys\\" or in more reflective works such as Anne Rice's \\"Interview With A Vampire\\", the bloodsucker genre is as varied and as colorful as American culture. <br />However, the success of one movie caricature of the undead over another, is its ability to do more than revel in vile mayhem and brutal gore. What makes a successful vampire movie, like all other myths, is the degree to which it speaks to the inner workings of contemporary culture and the emotional disposition of the audience. What made \\"Interview With A Vampire\\" a piece that will forever be etched in to cinematic history was its ability to elucidate some aspect of the human condition, and what caused the \\"The Lost Boys\\" to be perceived as a B rated horror film was its reluctance to dig into such issues and instead descend into vacuous bloodletting. <br />\\"Blade\\", fortunately, stands as a film that, much like \\"Interview With A Vampire\\", seeks to use vampirism to articulate more than \\"let me suck your blood\\". Granted, it has enough of violence and bloodshed to satisfy even the most masochistic of us. It is a visually stunning film, and much ink could be spilled on its deft use of martial arts, amazing visual effects (the precursor to the now famous Matrix bullet time effects), and mood establishing set design. But, far from being just eye candy and a belligerent cathartic release, \\"Blade\\" will reach at least cult iconic status for having endearing characters and an intricate story - one so rich with themes that it would take an entire series of sequels to explore them.  <br />\\"Blade\\", being an adaptation from the comic book character of the same name, starts where any good comic book story would start, with a tragedy. Blade's mother is shown in the opening sequence bleeding to death from a bite wound. She was pregnant at the time, and thebyproduct of her contact with a vampire and pregnancy was Blade, or as his enemies euphemistically refer to him as, \\"the daywalker\\". He shares the best of both worlds. He has the superhuman strength, speed, and agility of a vampire, and yet does not share their weakness of bursting into flames if he comes into contact with daylight. One drawback though: he shares their insatiable appetite for blood, and must periodically be drugged in order to keep from having to resort to consuming human blood himself. Because of what happened to his mother, Blade with the help of his human sidekick Whistler, spends his life in the relentless pursuit of vampires, and his ultimate goal is to eradicate them from the face of the earth.<br />The vampire world, just like our own, is a diverse one. On one side you have the established elite, the pure bloods, a race of vampires who are who they are by right of birth and can therefore trace their lineage back for centuries. They, over time, have forged an underground alliance with humans that have made them quite prosperous, while also allowing them to live in anonymity, thus shielding them from those who seek to destroy them. On the other side there are those who were not pure blood, those for one reason or another started off human and were turned into vampires by other vampires. They, for the most part, are comprised of the young and destitute. Being the downtrodden they naturally would seek any means necessary to better their station in life, but they need an aggressive leader to usurp the affluent vampire establishment. Thus enters Deacon Frost, a ruthless no holds barred vampire who is disgruntled with the pure bloods, and seeks to galvanize his ilk in a plan to overthrow the elitists. He quickly takes the helm of the vampire community and coerces the elitists into a plan that would unleash a demon spirit that would allow his kind the ability to walk in the daylight without becoming combustible. Hence, they would become a formidablethreat to the human race, not to mention to Blade himself. Frost however, needs the blood of a daywalker, and the only one known to exist is Blade. This sets up a crash course between Frost and Blade.    <br />The plot and characters are interesting in that they seem to embody a virtual cornucopia of societal ills. Many things are addressed from addiction, class struggle, racial based hegemony, and generational strife - things that are very much a part of our existence today. Given that it is done through the garb of a vampirism, one doesn't readily notice these themes, until one reflects upon the film and its deeper implications. <br />This is not to say that \\"Blade\\" is a serious endeavor at social commentary. Hardly. It is first and foremost an action film with an interesting plot, one that near its conclusion, throws in a twist that you will never see coming. The issues raised are mere points that help enrich the narrative, they in no way shape or form make \\"Blade\\" into some sort of preachy film.      <br />The martial arts choreography is some of the best I have seen from a film that was not produced in Asia. Since \\"Blade\\" was shot before \\"The Matrix\\", the ubiquitous use of wire tricks to embellish the martial arts action in most films, is not employed here. Hence, what you have is something that looks far more realistic, and attests to the adroitness of actors like Wesley Snipes. The martial arts style used is a cross between the gracefulness and fluidity of Bruce Lee to the rough street fighting style of Krav Maga (Israeli martial arts style). <br />\\"Blade\\", having such as a good story, well-developed characters, and breathtaking martial arts is definitely a must have for vampire or just plain action film enthusiasts.
B00005IC2H|5.0|At times it sounds like ambient space whales thrashing around alien babies who are crying with cotton webbed between their tiny teeth. Its a rock album under water.  Jn or (Jnsi) Birgisson's voice sounds like a sea anemone gently nudging the under belly of some soft aquatic mammal as it passes by. All in all I'm very impressed! I got the same feeling listening to this album, as I did listening to Radiohead's Ok Computer for the first time in 1997. At times, Agaetis Byrjun can only be described as a dichotomy, lost but found -  A half man half robot creation with confused emotions. Happy to be made of impenetrable metal, but unhappy that half the human experience, is lost. Sensing in its confusing, that something is incomplete. In the profound - extra-human experience, of \\" Fitter..Happier . . More Productive\\" the music of Agaetis byrjun chronicals a superfluous  sadness of moving begrudgingly forward as two incomplete - incompatible beings, because the subconscious instinct to live wills it so.Just feel it, don't deconstruct it.
0345451325|5.0|After playing the game to death I had a Halo shaped gap in my life which the fall of reach filled. I like sci fi and fantasy books anyway so it wasnt a huge reach (lol) to read this novel. I really enjoyed it, especially learning where the master cheif came from and how hardcore all the spartans were. Anyway if you like Halo or sci fi books you WILL like this so give it a go.          PEANUT
B000000W5L|5.0|Damn this album is a mess, it is also full of the most ass shaking good times you will ever find on any album period. Seriously, if 'Rocks Off' doesnt make you want to  do your best mick jagger imitation in your bedroom mirror i dont know what will. Like most, this album didnt grab me right off, i found a few gems, some memorable hooks, and interesting lyrics emerging from the gloom, that sent me back time and again. This isnt for virgins to the stones,this is for those who are already hooked. Regardless of what mick or keith say, this is the epitome, to me anyway, of the Rolling stones, their best, and though i may be bias, the greatest rock album i have ever heard.
B00004U8JV|3.0|I really thought the whole, My girlfriend is on the island so I must go save her, was really stupid. Coulden't they find a better way to get him there? Unlike others, I did not think the acting was that bad. I really thought Jeff did a good job. I thought the special effects were good too. The thing that really made me mad was that the movie was compleatly different from the great book by Michael Crichton. If you read the book but have not seen the movie, DO NOT BUY THE MOVIE. It will be a waste of your time and money. Instead go and read the novel again. The fact that they changed the characters and made new ones for the movie was just plain stupid. I say it would have been a better movie if they just stuck to the book.
B00005JMFR|2.0|While I recognize it is difficult to keep the momentum up after the amazing first film, this movie felt slow, full of cliche and some of the dialogue was downright ridiculous. I'm probably the first to pull out a tissue during a good drama, but nothing in this movie moved me. I consider it a bad sign that after following these characters through three films I felt no attachment to them. Despite some great special effects and a few pseudo-horror winces, I have to say I expected better. It's not as lame as Star Wars, hence 2 stars rather than 1, but it definitely did not live up to the promise of its beginnings. I probably would have gotten more out of it if I had left my expectations at home.
B0000524EM|4.0|The Crow - An absolutely brilliant film, and one of the best adaptations of a book (or graphic novel, for that matter) I've seen.  James O'Barr's twisted world is conveyed perfectly.  My only issue with the film stems solely from my unbridled passion for the book: Eric isn't nearly as demented in the film as he ought to be.  Book!Eric had absolutely and completely lost his mind in his hunger for revenge, where Film!Eric was a teeny bit twisted sometimes.  This is easily ignored, though, in light of the excellent acting, directing, cinematography, etc.<br />The Crow: City of Angels - My personal favourite of the three.  Sarah, the little girl from the first film, returns as an incredibly hhhhot young woman.  She guides Ash, the new Crow, seamlessly bringing in the mythology and spirituality of the first film.  Iggy Pop costars as The Villian With The Coolest Death Scene Ever, exuding insanity and badassitude.  The visuals set the perfect mood, somehow transforming L.A. into a believeably dark and broken city, and the imagery and themes of the Day of the Dead celebrations running throughout the film are perfect.<br />The Crow: Salvation - I didn't like this film nearly as well as the other two, mostly because it didn't bring in any of the totemic and mystical themes for which the series ought to be known, and because the high-school-boyfriend concept seemed a little immature compared to the other Crows.  However, it was deliciously dark and violent, and I'm a sucker for the mystery element, something that the other Crow films lacked.<br />This boxed set is definitely worth one's time, if one can resist the urge to pick at the minor flaws - just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br />And one should definitely do a search in the books section for 'The Crow'.
0441003257|5.0|&quot;Good Omens&quot; is delightful, charming, and wise. I like it better than anything either author has written individually (of what I've read from them thus far) - which is saying a lot, as both authors are fine writers indeed.  Caught initially by the title, I first read &quot;Good Omens&quot; years ago.  I return to it from time to time for its lovable characters, distinctive humor, zany plot, and especially for its moving conclusions - not in the least hackneyed - that love conquers all and there really is no place like home.  With &quot;Good Omens&quot; Gaiman and Pratchett have created magic.
B00005JMFR|1.0|The worst movie of all trilogy. The second was bad and I thought this one can`t get any worse, I was SO wrong. The two hourse of completely lame action. Action is bad also and borring. Don`t waste your money on this \\"movie\\" just watch the second part once more
B000003CKH|2.0|I bought this album for &quot;The Distance,&quot; an outstanding and mesmerizing song which is the only reason to give the album even two stars.  Most of the other songs are awful.  The lyrics are cold and repellent and the music forgettable.  Don't waste your money unless you're a hard-core Cake fan.
B00000I8UE|4.0|Beautiful and soothing to the ear.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|Coldplay's albums were both great, but honestly, their songs really come to life live.  The rock songs rock harder, and the ballads are more emotional live.  You can see the track list above, it has all of their hits, including 'See You Soon' which was a b-side, but is included on both the CD and DVD, and is a really good song. The quality of the audio is great on the cd and dvd, and the video gives you a good feeling that you are actually at the concert.  I didn't get the chance to see Coldplay live, but after seeing this DVD, I definately will the next time they are on tour.  I highly recommend this DVD/CD!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|After 5 years of eagerly waiting for her next album, all I can say is, it's a pity there's only 10 songs on the CD.  Every song here is a hit single... no joke.  Others have said better about 'Afterglow'.  All I can say is, I hope Sarah doesn't wait too long next time to release her wonderful material.  She's an amazing songwriter and this an amazing follow up to 'Surfacing'; She's a muse for our generation.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I am going to see it tonight.  From what I heard it sucks.  But, I have also read a many reviews on this site and others that said it was amazing.  And in each of these good reviews it brings up topics like tantric,philosophy, and other ideas of life that most people do not know about.  Is it a good movie, but just too deep and smart for the average american movie go'er?  Are we all programmed through society that a movie should have that easy storyline with developed emotional characters and that happy ending where we find out EVERYTHING that happened in the movie?  It appears so.  Remember guys, this movie is the authors vision.  Its not supposed to follow any rules.  ITs a frickin  movie.  Either you like it or don't.  But don't put the movie down because its not what you expected it to be like.  Look at the first of the triligy.  No one had a clue it was going to be THAT popular.  The ideas expressed did confuse alot of people .  So, with all of that in mind, go see the matrix if you liked the first two.  Remember that its not a happy ending you should be expecting like in every other movie ever made.. its the matrix, who knows what could happen.
B00006879E|5.0|This is by far the best cd to come along in years..by ANY artist.  Every single last song on the cd is a great tune.  Personally, i listen to mostly classic rock and never any new music.  But, this band has taken a hold of me and unbelievably made me a huge fan.  Again...great CD         BUY IT!!!<BR>-    big fan
B0000AM6LY|4.0|First, I have to admit I was really surprised to find out that Simply Red was still around. I have their greatest hits CD, but was only really familiar with a few of the tracks that charted here in the U.S. back in the 80's. So, imagine my surprise when I was vacationing in Europe this summer and came across not just Simply Red being played on radio, but also music videos. <br />I fell in love with &quot;Fake&quot; which is why I bought the CD when I returned to the U.S. and although the CD version is not the one that was featured on the video, it's still a great cut that has a 60's Motown feel to it. &quot;Sunrise&quot; immediately became my favorite track on the CD. As mentioned by others, the sampling of Hall and Oates' &quot;I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)&quot; really works here, definitely dances up the song. &quot;Home&quot; is also another standout and is reminiscent of Simply Red's earlier U.S. hits. The cover of &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; is good, but if a Stylistics' tune had to be covered, I think &quot;You Are Everything&quot; would have suited Mick's voice a little better. &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; has a jazzy, Sunday-brunch feel to it, Mick's voice complements the music really well.<br />Overall an impressive work by Simply Red. Glad to know they're still around.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's debut album is quite amazing.  Finally, there is a musician out there performing great music because of his sensational raw talent, not just the factor to get on MTV.  This is just the beginning for a career that should last many decades.  DeGraw's talent capults this cd, creating a new level and standard for amazing musical talent.  The cd has such great flewidity and there is never any track that you would want to skip over.  The lyrics are great and thoughtful, they have the essence of a great songwriter all over them.  &quot;I Don't Want To Be&quot; is probably the most exciting song to listen to on the cd because of its great sound.  It is great to hear a musician who can really sing, and I mean a legit voice and DeGraw again holds his own on his vocals and isn't afraid to mix it up.  All the vocals are not for the sake of trying to oversing every song which is what you find in today's pop world.  He's just an awesome singer.  Go out, buy the cd and support this amazing accomplishment that should be remembered come Grammy time.  Hopefully DeGraw will achieve the status of Norah Jones (another great real musician) that he so greatly deserves.  Simply Awesome!
B0000C9V3T|4.0|The soundtrack is great, but for one glaring ommission of the musical works of Ennio Morricone from the Spaghetti Westerns. For example, from the movie Death Rides a Horse... The track called &quot;Man to Man&quot; is missing... Oh well, perhaps they couldn't get Ennio's estate to allow its use on the soundtrack...
B00005JMFR|5.0|Ok, first of all I have read many of the reviews here. Honestly I think most of you don't give Matrix Revolutions the credit is deserves and you guys are even giving bad reviews to Matrix Reloaded. I went to the very first showing at 6am and I actaully saw the movies twice on opening day.  The visual effects are absolutely amazing, the 3rd installment fills in everything that was missing from the 2nd movie, and the fight scenes in this last installment were very inventive and choreagraphed very well. But this may not be the last movie in the series (myself and many others hope not) because the Wachowski brothers conlcluded the war, but they left it open to other installments. Yes, even though our be-loved Trinity dies just means that it gave Neo more of a reason to fight and defeat Agent Smith. Every great story (fiction or non-fiction) involves tragedy.  This is why Trinity dies.  This movie has fullfilled all my expectations and I am very satisfied with how it was portrayed.  I recommend this movie to all who are Matrix or sci-fi fans.  This is my favorite sci-fi series of all time. Star wars is a total bomb since the newest installments.  If you want good action, special effects, story-line, and a well scripted movie; go and see this ASAP.
B00005JMFR|2.0|Ill give it to the W brothers, they really know how to suck the money out of the gullible american public. If you really dont want me to spoil this for you than stop reading now. First of all the Matrix took the movie industry and America by storm with the release of the first one in 99. The second was good, but not as good as the first. It had the potential of becoming a very great movie trilogy. But that fell real short, thanks to the third installment. I thought that Trinitys death was very shallow, and of course so was Neos. I know he ended up saving Zion, but only to make a temporary deal for peace? C'mon, that was such a cop out considering that neo was supposed to be the \\"One\\", or the Messiah to save Mankind. I would have bought it if Trinity didnt die, and she was pregnant with Neos child. But the way she died was just shallow. Neo saves her in the second film, only to die in the third? One of my biggest nit pik is that when Neo was fighting Smith I felt that Neo wasnt using his full potential. In the first one after Smith shoots him and he gets up, to find out hes the One, he moves with lightning fast speed. Where was that power when he was fighting Smith? He just gave up and agreed with Smith and let him assimilate him. \\"It is inevitable\\". If they actually come out with a 4th one(which it wont be the same without Neo, or Trinity), it just wont have the same Oomph. But then it just leaves it open \\"Did Neo really die?\\". When his body is being carted off by the Machines, it looked like you were seeing it through the way Neo viewed things, all in orange(like how he saw Smith through the human disguise).
B0000CABBW|5.0|A film by Niki Caro<br />This movie opens in a hospital.  A Maori woman is giving birth to twins.  The grandfather of the children has been waiting for the birth of a child to be the new chief of the tribe.  Two children are born: one male, one female.  The male child dies along with the mother.  The grandfather is disappointed and already starts on his son to find a new wife so that the son can have another male child.  The son rebels and runs away from his family.  The baby girl that the grandfather resented is left in his care.  We skip forward enough years to get us into the present and the baby girl has grown into a young girl (early teenage years, perhaps) named Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes).<br />With the tribe needing a chief, and Pai not being a boy, Pai's grandfather decides to train the tribe's youth in the old ways, in the hopes that one of them will grow to be the next chief.  Pai is the closest to living the old ways as any of the children of the tribe, but the little problem of her being a girl keeps coming up.  She is forbidden to train with the boys, but practices on her own.  The movie is mostly the conflict between Pai and her grandfather and how she fits into the tribe.  We all know how this movie has to end, but there is little (or no) clich&eacute; in the journey Whale Rider takes us on.  The movie succeeds on the strength of young Keisha Castle-Hughes' performance.  With a theme that suggests the movie will be nothing more than yet another \\"uplifting\\" story filled with emotion and cheese, Whale Rider turns out to be one of the year's best (and I say this with confidence) as it rises above the cheese-potential and succeeds as a powerful film.
0385504209|5.0|This book was great fun.  Once I started reading I was hard pressed to put the book down.  The action starts immediately and throughout it all, I was learning a lot about quite a few subjects.<br />The characters are drawn broadly, but they are believable and distinct from one another.  There are all types peppered throughout.<br />Most readers will enjoy this one.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I'll admit, at first listen I didn't think too highly of this album. All I could think about was &quot;this beat out Interpol for the Shortlist prize? The Streets? Beat out those brilliant albums that deserved the award much more? Get out of here.&quot; However, I decided to give the album a second listen and tried my best to put those prejudices aside, and I'm glad I did because the Shortlist must have seen what I missed the first time listening to it: a quiet lyrical and musical power. There's no doubt that this album isn't the most original ever, but there is a delicate (hmm, first track's title) power to this album. I enjoy listening closer to it and hearing the little nuances buried in the mix that I missed the first few times, most notably the playground ambience on &quot;Older Chests&quot;. Although some moments can veer a little too close to emo for my liking (the unhidden track that uses the &quot;Silent Night&quot; melody for a tale of pain and heartbreak), this is a solid folk album that embraces orchestral work in satisfying ways. Get it now and push it over Gold!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I am a huge Sarah fan, after Lilth fair I thought, wow here is a gal to follow and buy more of her music. So after 5 years she puts out Afterglow which I was expecting to be really really novel and new..unfortunately towards the end of the CD the songs all merge into one.  Fallen, World on Fire, Stupid...<BR>excellent songs...however not much to say about the rest.<BR>Her Remixes are great...which the CD comes with as part of Bandwith service, you logon and when played on PC there are some nice features associated with it.<br />All in all a little like her last effort but not much emotion or umph to this effort, probably sold out a little with the commericial success of her past.
0440236304|3.0|If I were to award stars based on the heroics contained within the pages or Currahee!, I'd have to award 5-stars.  Unfortunately, I have to rate the book based on how well this personal account of the Normandy engagement was told and whether or not it was very engaging.  With that in mind, I'd probably rate the book between 2 1/2 and 3 stars.  My biggest problem with the book is that the author attempts to cover too much material in too small a book.  The end result is I never really felt connected on a personal level and the story comes off as disjointed.  <br />Currahee has thee chapters; Training for Combat, Waiting for Combat, and Combat.  While there is some interesting content in each of the chapters, the first two chapters are too long in my opinion and water down the main story by leaving only a mere 119 pages to discuss his account at Normandy.  Thus the final chapter contains several very detailed accounts of the battle which end up fitting loosely together.  Probably what hampered me the most while I was reading Currahee! was that I kept wishing it could have been written as well another book which I'd read, GUNS UP by Johnny M. Clark.

B00008PW2D|1.0|2 Discs, that's all you get for the price of the other sets?  This is a very bad decision from somebody.  Sadly, this season  will not be making it into my DVD collection until the price reflects what you are getting.
B00003CX8T|5.0|As the title says, this really is one of Disney's best movies, in my opinion.  Full of jokes for both children and adults, this is definately a movie worth buying.  Watching it today still entertains me as much as it did back when i saw it in the theatre when I was 9.  Robin Williams does an incredible job as the Genie; and Jonathan Freeman is equally impressive voicing my favorite character from the movie, Jafar.  The release date for this DVD is sometime next year, and I definately intend to add it to my collection.
0380733358|4.0|This is the fourth Follett book I've read.  The first was Pillars of the Earth, followed by A Place CAlled Freedom, followed by A Dangerous Fortune.  <br />While I didn't like this one as much as the others it was still a good read.  Strong characters, a villain you love to hate, true to life situations and relationships all make this book an interesting one.  <br />The setting and circumstances are very plausible.  Could the success or failure of one of Hitler's most trusted spies turn the tides of the second world war?<br />The ending was definetly worth the whole entire read.  I recommend this one for spy thriller and follett fans alike.

0446530891|4.0|Secret Service Agent Michelle Maxwell let a presidential candidate out of her sight against her better judgment. He disappears with a trace. Eight years ago, Sean King's career as a secret service agent was derailed when the presidential candidate he was protecting was killed in front of him when his attention was diverted for a split second. Michelle and Sean's lives entwine when the circumstances of their respective screw-ups appear to be related. <br />David Baldacci has written another winner. This was book had me hooked from the first page. The plot was skillfully written interweaving past and present facts. We have two very compelling protagonists that look like they were set up for a sequel, at least I hope so. This is the kind of thriller that keeps you on your toes from the first page to the last. It would have been a 5 star book, except the climax was a bit too unbelievable.  It was almost like a light bulb went off and suddenly the case is solved. It all unraveled a little too fast. I don't want to give too much away, but the first 4/5 of the book was so good that the ending really did not detract from my overall enjoyment.
B000089RVX|5.0|FALLEN is absolutely the best album I have ever bought. To say that it is just fabricated music is ridiculous. Even comparing the music to Linkin Park is ridiculous. Every single track on this album is worthy of respect and is special and unique in its own way. I was desperately waiting to purchase this cd three months before it even came out and Im glad it lived up to my expectations. Even if youre not in to rock music you will like this. Not to mention that they are amazing in concert, better than anyone else. If there was a 6 on the scale I would give it a 10.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Like most of the reviewers here, I'm also a big fan of Badu. True this CD is a slight departure from previous releases, but I dare say Worldwide Underground was conceived with the same spirit that drew us into her world the first time. She's an artist-we knew that initially. Let her experiment. Take your headphones OFF, table that smoke and listen. The lines between neo-soul, trip-hop, hip-hop and downtempo are blurring again <br />&quot;I Want You&quot; is taxing, though (my only complaint). True fans of Badu, Jill, Roots, Common, and Duplaix are already open to alternative forms of hed-nod. Get on with life. Quit hatin'. It's possible that when you finally hear the &quot;ultimate vibe&quot;, you may pass on it because it may not have a point of reference. That's sad. Move forward one step Badu!
0141301139|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox is a slim book; it certainly is not as long as \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", \\"The BFG\\", or other Roald Dahl classics.  If you have a young reader who hates to read or has a hard time reading, \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is an excellent choice.  It's got great characters to root for, a fun plot and premise, and reads pretty quickly.  I gave this to a young friend of mine who dreads reading, and he stayed up all night to finish it!
B00005NGAL|4.0|Any version of this production (Elaine Paige, Ken Page, et. al.) is going to be good.<br />But before you buy, be aware that this is *not* exactly the same production as the year 2000 Commemorative Edition.  The audio has been re-mastered, and the production uses some alternative takes that are not the ones used in the previous release.<br />Probably I'm just suffering from the &quot;It's different from what I'm used to so it can't be any good&quot; syndrome, but I did prefer the previous version to this one.  The &quot;Rumpus Cat&quot; scene in particular suffered from the changed audio in my opinion.<br />If you've never seen this production of CATS, you will absolutely love this.  I just liked the previous version a little bit better.
B000002LRX|5.0|When Faith No More released this album back in 1992, grunge was in full swing, gangsta rap was on the rise, and most of the hair bands that had dominated mainstream music were getting started on their resumes. Thus, there was much going on that might have resulted in this album getting overlooked. As a result, most of the music-listening public lost out on what might be the greatest modern rock album, one that weaves between genres effortlessly, and takes the listener on a very dark trip through all sorts of demented minds and situations. FNM's sound on this album has been aped countless times, but none of the imitators have come anywhere close to the soul of this album, however dark it may be. It is known that there was internal turmoil taking place when the band was recording this album (mostly between guitarist Jim Martin and the others), and FNM was being pressured to follow up the hugely successful \\"The Real Thing\\" with another groundbreaking record. In my book, they delievered an album infinitely better than its predecessor, and sadly, not even closely rivalled by the FNM albums that came out after it. The opening track, \\"Land of Sunshine\\", forces the listener to examine the nature of true happiness, and suggests that the line between joy and senility might be rather thin. \\"Caffeine\\" is an angry trudger, \\"Midlife Crisis\\" is a foot-tapping, pseudo-rap boogie, and \\"RV\\" addresses the benefits of white trash parenting. \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" is tribal and atmospheric, \\"Everything's Ruined\\" is a jamming little tune that compares child-rearing to investing (with predictably disastrous results), and \\"Malpractice\\" weaves a dark yarn about a person whose greatest thrill is to be operated on. I believe that \\"Kindergarten\\" is about a retarded person who notices that he is not moving forward, yet the surroundings seem to be getting smaller. \\"Be Aggressive\\" is a homo-erotic cheerleader chant, \\"A Small Victory\\" looks at winning and losing, and \\"Crack \\" is a disco-fried dittyabout a man who gets irritable and grouchy ,maybe even homicidal, while on crack. \\"My guess is that \\"Jizzlobber\\" has something to do with being caught while in the act of, and \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is a little movie theme instrumental outro. A towering release that jumps between thrash, odd time signatures, screaming, whispering, disco, and chickens cackling. If you do not have this release, or have not given it a try, then consider your development stunted.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|This movie dead man walking is a very controversial but impressive movie.It has a lot of different views invloved you get to see both sides of the story and feel both sides as well.It proves that we are all human and that we all all bleed the color red.It proves that love overcomes anything and that faith still in fact does exist.It also deals a lot with hope and pain.If you really want to watch a movie that makes you think and feel then I definetly reccomend this one its a dead winner!!!
B00005JMFR|2.0|Never before have I been so excited to see a movie... and never before have I been so disappointed by the ending! If I were to rank the 3 movies; it would go 1. Reloaded, 2. Matrix, 3. Revolutions. I have read many reviews that Reloaded was the worst of the 3, but Revolutions is BY FAR the worse of the three. For more than half of the movie, the only \\"actors\\" on the screen are either Sentinels or some other form of CGI character. This is not to say that the visuals are bad, just leave a lot to be desired. And the absolute worst part of the movie has to be the end fight between Neo and Smith. I kept waiting for someone to whip out some kryptonite on both of them. What's with all the flying around, guys??? Come on... keep it on the ground. And when did Neo get so wimpy?? In Reloaded, Neo takes on hundreds of smiths and doesn't get hurt. In Revolutions, he fights only one Smith and gets his [fundament] handed to him! And don't get me started about the anticlimactic ending. I am almost praying that when the DVD comes out there is at least one other alternate ending. Please God!! Let there be another ending because the one in the movie [is bad]!!!!!!!!<br />Ok, I'm done venting for now.
B000002KYK|3.0|I saw this film when it was released in the UK and was stunned. It became our most hired video when that came out, which my friends and I watched with a regularity that bordered obsession. Not surprisingly, as soon as the LP was available, I bought it. <br />There is no denying that the orchestral version is not as good as the actual soundtrack but for some reason it was the only one released at the time. It is a pleasant record and for me, will always be hugely evocative of the 80's and early 90's when it served as background music to countless evenings with friends. <br />It's not brilliant but it is interesting. If you're fanatical about Blade Runner it's probably worth the few quid it costs, even if for no other reason than curiosity (though a scratchy vinyl disk from the time might be what you really want).
B00006JLX4|5.0|Way back in the late eighties, early ninties I used to listen to british mod music and psychedilia because back then the only thing worse than the clothes and hair was the music. then came along Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted, without the help of MTV (sorry Nirvana I still love you), this album along with My Bloody Valentine's Loveless blew everything else away. Ten plus years and many speakers later I still listen to both, and still am in awe.<br />Usually I do not look kindly on reissues with a bunch of extra crap, but these extras are exceptional.  If you have the older version you should look into this as well.<br />If elected President I will buy each and every American a copy of this album. Either way you should own this album. Or Al Qaeda wins.
0156027321|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br />On one level this book was brilliant: it was full of warmth, humor, lovable characters, and arcane knowledge about both religion and animal behavior. But on another level I just couldn't read through it. The description of days at sea and on the island had me feeling anxious and vaguely nauseated, and in the end I skipped about a third of it to get to the end. The author says &quot;this book has a happy ending,&quot; but I was left with a feeling of sadness as well. Yes, Pi creates a new life for himself, a life with loving relationships, but Pi's trauma can never have been undone.
6305922748|4.0|This is probably not as funny as it once was, unfortunately, at least to a younger generation.  And frankly, considering all that has come to past in rock and roll, it seems a little tame, even a little on the lame side in places.  Or perhaps I have grown too jaded.  Since Rob Reiner dreamed up this \\"pseudo-rockumentary\\" (after affixing some gold paint strategically on the USS Coral Seas baseball cap he wears--one of the many sight gags in the movie) the satirical assault on rock culture as been done and done again, perhaps a time or two too many.<br />The music itself is, shall we say, derivative with the Stones, some early Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and others having some distant unavoidable influence, while the unwashed antics of the stars both on stage and off have become cliches of the biz.  Worse yet, satirizing the documentary mode itself has been done to death.<br />Alas, can we have back those moments of splendor in the grass (Wordsworth) or when we first leaned back in the movie theater, the smell of rancid popcorn butter in our nose, and sticky soda corn syrup on the soles of our shoes, and got blasted away by Spinal Tap?  No, Virginia, you can't go home again, sad to say.<br />Might as well jump (Van Halen, 1984).
B00005JM02|5.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the DVD to get this month. As most of you know DVD's are released every Tuesday. If you buy only one DVD all month, make it this one. I don't care if you live alone or have three kids.. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a crowd pleaser regardless. People young, old or middle aged will find that &quot;Nemo&quot; has alot to offer. It's among the best that Disney/Pixar has released. The animation is liquid smooth and flaw free. It has a wonderful story, and the voice talents are splendid. I loved the humor that Ellen DeGeneres brought to her superbly written character. Also Albert Brooks (shame on that person who had negative words about Mr. Brooks) who voiced Nemo's father, he brought the frightened father who coundn't let go to life with skill and brilliance. &quot;Nemo&quot; is a heartwarming film that will be a treasure forever. Buy it now before it sales out and you aren't able to get it for 20 years, (you know how cruel Disney can be).
B00003W8NM|4.0|... to all those people who made this great movie for all the bad things I said the first time I saw it. Let me elaborate..<br />I only went to see the movie because of my beloved Edward Norton. You know, I have even seen smootcy  for the guy (which is not so bad, by the way). I spend most of the time pissed off because of all the blood, fighting, fake BS \\"you don't need cars, furniture, label cloths\\" until the time -sorry for giving it up- the narrator finds out Tyler doesn't exist but in his head. This story twist was all I really enjoyed in the movie... And I spent some time saying the worst things about it. <br />Then the DVD was released, so I rent it for Norton's interview at Yale. Defining moment!!!! First of all the promotion package of the movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen (unfortunately these things only reach the US or at least they don't reach Greece), such an inspired catalogue, kind of reminded me of [...] The rest of the bonus material was good as well, but what was really worth it, was watching the film for the second time. Totally different... Knowing what is really going on, you have a chance to observe the little things that don't catch your eye the first time. Plus, I forgot about the blood and fighting and paid more attention to the excellent humor the movie has.. Irony mixed with anger, a bit desperation, and full of antitheses... amazing! <BR>For example, there's a scene where Helena Bonham Carter's character, a woman that is, enters a support group for men with testicular cancer... It's hilarious! Or the scene in which the macho Brad Pitt's character shows up in a ridiculous pink robe with matching goofy slippers.<br />You have to see it.. please more than once. This movie just doesn't get boring. The more you see it, the more you discover. It's almost the same feeling you have when you come along amazing books.
B00005T30L|4.0|no im not being sarcastic. I really do think amazing can be used to describe this film. Maybe not so on the first viewing but once you watch it a second/third time youll be more in tune with it. Not everyone will like the film. I think you have to either identify with the characters or at least get the humour. Which is dark and most of the time quite subtle. If you love, films like she's all that and programmes like dawsons creek then you probably wont like this.<br />Basically, 2 friends (enid and rebecca) who dont fit into &quot;society&quot; (arent your typically mallrat teens at the end of the day) graduate from highschool and look to getting a flat together. Unfortunately, while rebecca tries to make an effort to earn some money by getting a job, enid doesnt even want to fit into that kind of world. She has an &quot;everything sucks&quot; (which it does, mostly) attitude. So probably out of boredom, she and rebecca set up , what seems on the surface, a sad old loser (Seymour) on a fake blind date. However, things change as does enid's attitide towards him..........not so original you may say,. Indeed on paper, the plot isnt and enid isnt necessarily a charcter you can sympathise with. but you do. The originality and beauty is in the style of the film (which it has, without being pretensious), the way the charcters and story unfolds and the performances. <br />Its edgy and different. And whilst many films like (the recently released &quot;in the cut&quot;) try to be, they fail where ghost world succedes. Its not necessarily a teen movie but you do have to be over 15, i think, to really appreciate it.<br />The best things about it is thora birch's performance. Its real, subtle and not cliched like her character in american beauty.<br />My only fault with it is that it can feel a  little slow, during the last part of the movie especially after the beginning but I think that in fact makes you think about it and appreciate the ending more.<br />Its my favourite filmso far cos I can really identify with enid but even if you cant, its still worth watching for its humour and characters.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I'm shocked that this movie hasnt been out a full day and already most people are giving up on it calling it awful and saying theres no answers.  For one the matrix has and always will be a series of movies that need to be viewed more than once and thought about more than a day to fully understand.  The answers are all there, however there not in black in white there more in code.  Everything told to Neo is meant for the viewer as well.  I thought it was brilliant.  It has action, Drama, Sadness, Suspense and everything else you can imagine, it has it all.  I'd say its much better then reloaded, but not quite up to par with the first one.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I've just come from seeing Revolutions and the only thing I can think to say is, \\"WOW!\\" It's been a long time since I was so gripped by a movie. The Matrix Revolutions really grabs you and doesn't let go.<br />The film was honestly better then I expected, and I had high expectations. But to be fair, this really is a film for those who have invested in the first two films of the series. It's not enough to simply have seen the first two films, but a decent comprehension of the underlying themes (especially those presented in Reloaded) is necessary to really take away all Revolutions has to offer.<br />This film picks up exactly where Reloaded left off. The first 30-minutes or so is all drama and dialogue without any action whatsoever. I've heard complaints about this, but it really is necessary to set up what is to come. Once all that's done with, and the various characters set out on their various paths, the movie is all down hill. That is to say, like the drop on a rollercoaster, not that it loses quality. Indeed, you may feel your stomach in your chest as the intensity builds to levels rarely seen in movies before.<br />Unlike the previous Matrix films, this film rarely takes place within that artificial reality. This is a film about humanity, specifically those in Zion, and their last battle against the Machines. Even Neo, the savior of humanity, has less screen time than in either of the previous two films. In Revolutions we finally see Neo for what he represents to mankind rather than simply an all powerful \\"super man\\" character. In Revolutions we understand that Neo is a savior not because of what he \\"can\\" do, but because of what he \\"choosess\\" to do.<br />The film's two set pieces feature an epic battle between Zionists and the sentinel army that is so epic that it defies understanding, and a final showdown between Neo and his adversary, Smith who's grown even more powerful than Neo. Undoubtedly these two scenes will be the highlight of many mainstream goers, and certainly they are worth the price of admission alone just to see. But the real power to this film is in the ending that is sure to leave many people scratching their heads.<br />It's unfortunate that many people will likely be confused by the film's ending, but those who've been following along will come to realize that it is the only conclusion that is really possible. It's extremely difficult to talk about this film without spoiling it, but let's just say that the Wachowski's definately understand that kicking butt, even though it looks cool, is not what makes a hero.<br />The Matrix Revolutions is much different in style and story than the original Matrix, but it is also the perfect conclusion to what happens after Neo hangs up the phone at the end of the first film.nd certainly they are worth the price of admission alone just to see.

B00005JMFR|1.0|Eye candy. I am so tired of simplistic, gigawatt, eye candy. Can you believe it? I adored the first film. Thought the second one was a good example of what happens when a filmaker(x2) is handed too much money... and the third? Most people on this site have a better grasp of writing than the twits that spun this monstrosity. Yes, pretty to look at. Yes, I've grown fond of Morpheus, Trinity and Neo... but if the Matrix (Original) was a sci-fi fan's dream come true, this trash represents what a good sci-fi fan hates: limited vision and imagination. A saga? Yes, if you decide to stick to what you saw possible after seeing the first one. Let your own imagination show you what could have been...<br />Now usually one watches a film to forget about reality and submerse oneself in someone else's life... Tonight I'm going to watch a good movie to forget the trash I just saw...<br />As for you 10 out of 10ers, rent a Hayao Miyazaki film... or Indiana Jones! Or read Neuromancer, or anyhing by Philip K. Dick...

B00005221L|5.0|It sits perched in the trees, invisible to the naked eye. It watches them trek through the rainforest. It stalks them slowly, lunging forward when given the chance but never revealing itself. It follows their patterns and mimics their voices. The leader turns, sporting a serious expression of fear. It is Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger). &quot;If it bleeds, we can kill it,&quot; he says, glancing down at the green liquid.<br />Terror comes in many forms, but so does action, and &quot;Predator&quot; successfully combines both. We already know the fate of our hero, but that does not matter, simply because we enjoy the ride. This is a smart action/horror/thriller that doesn't fall back on cliches, but pushes forward, aware that it may be following such films as &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) but yet only improving upon the presented material. The Predator is a work of genius--originally fitted for Jean-Claude Van Damme and shaped like a giant bug, it was later reworked by creature effects artist Stan Winston (with the help of James Cameron) after Van Damme was fired due to complaining too much about how hot and stuffy his suit was. The villain helps make this movie, and if there were ever a terrifying creature it is the Predator, which is not only visually haunting but an emphasis of how advanced life forms could hunt us like we hunt animal prey.<br />Kevin Peter Hall hadn't gotten much work then; a few stage performances but nothing serious. He was picked up by John McTiernan because he was taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger and, when placed in the alien suit, he not only looked fierce but he also looked like he could be the one and only true opponent to Arnold, a man who looks like he eats babies for breakfasts. (And perhaps grown humans for lunch.)<br />Not only is he the perfect opponent, he helps make the movie. A lot of the film's positive elements come from the lush Cambodian jungles, the haunting direction by McTiernan, the ultimate macho combat role by Arnold,the paranoia and startlingly effective idea of the remote settings. Much of it also comes from the fact that the alien, when finally revealed, looks real. It looks real, all right, and also pretty darn horrifying. (Who can forget when it drops its face mask and reveals its true self?)<br />Major Dutch Schaefer and his elite team of US Commandos are sent deep into the swampy depths of a Columbian jungle, trying to locate a downed chopper carrying a Cabinet Member. &quot;Do your Cabinet Members always fly on the wrong side of the border?&quot; Dutch quips before he and his men are loaded into their means of transportation. <br />They arrive in the jungle and soon find that a camouflaged creature is ritualistically stalking and murdering them. But this isn't just random slasher style--it picks off its prey on a whimsy, and only attacks fair game (e.g. those with weapons). Soon Dutch and his team realize that getting out of the jungle isn't going to be as easy as they thought.<br />For me, &quot;Predator&quot; is one of the best action films of all time. It has everything. It isn't messy and over-paced; it takes its time getting where it's going, building up the tension for the audience, and then unleashes a bombardment of action set pieces and visual effects. Another great thing is that it is sort of Hitchcockian in a way; it doesn't show us the killer, at least not at first. It again takes its time, building up the tension, getting us primed. When it finally does show us the creature, we're shocked.<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger fits the role like a glove; criticize him all you want, Dutch was made for him. Can you imagine Sly or Willis playing Dutch? Not me, either. This is his time to shine. Shine he does. <br />The series is getting a jumpstarted revival next year with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004). There are doubts as to whether or not it will live up to long-growing expectations, especially with Paul W.S. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; Anderson at the helm, but Iremain the optimist as far as I can. The idea of the two species joining together for a feature film was hinted at in &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), then hinted at even further with a line of comic books, fan fiction, and great videogames. I, personally, cannot wait.

B00005JLTN|5.0|Without a doubt, Matrix Reloaded is just simply the best movie right now.  Following the big hit, The Matrix, Reloaded keeps people glued to their seats the entire movie.  The fight scenes are just unbelievable, although a little unrealistic, but that is how it has to be.  I am tired of people claiming that the fight scenes were too fake.  Come on, it is Neo, THE ONE, of course it is going to be fake.  He is fighting agents and computer programs, so of course it will be a little &quot;out there&quot;.  Matrix Reloaded keeps the viewers wondering because it is very confusing.  There are so many twists in the movie that you never know what to expect.  The ending was a perfect money-maker for the directors but upsetting for viewers.  Everyone has to wait until The Matrix Revolutions comes out so they can finally find out what is going on.  Very confusing but the best movie of the year.  <br />The Matrix had some great fight scenes, especially the all so famous gun scene (Neo and Trinity unload on a numerous amount of guards) but the Matrix Reloaded has a different kind of excitement.  The freeway scene is all too interesting it just makes you want to watch it over and over.  There is also another unbelievably long fight scene with Neo showing off his fancy new moves.  A must see movie. But don't try to pick up by just watching this one.  If you haven't seen the first Matrix, don't even try watching this one until you have.  It is too confusing to try to get by just watching The Matrix Reloaded.<br />If I could give this movie a rating higher than five stars, I would.  Unfortuanetely we don't, so five will have to do.  Be sure to catch this exciting movie so you are ready for the final one.  Speaking of which, it comes out today, Wednesday, November 5.

B00005JLTN|5.0|This series of films has many layers. I think the deepest one being a metaphor of life itself. Essentially the movie is about the struggles that we as human beings have to go through our life. In the beginning of our life (just as in the first movie) the obstacles that are imposed to us are not so bad and that's why there's only one Mr. Smith. As time goes by it gets more and more difficult to live, and there are more Mr. Smiths surrounding us. Eventually, if we get to old age there is only one battle to be fought which is with death. And this is the ultimate battle which cannot be won. Thus life is a lost battle. Although we know that some of us decide to still accept the terms of this battle (and this is what Neo decides to do). And why? There is no purpose in life, just causality (as we are told in the second movie). Nevertheless we accept the tragedy of our life and go on. There is more about this movie than can be written here, but it is enough to say this trilogy is worth every penny.

B000002A46|5.0|Actually, you probably want a little more than a single CD :) but it's a good start! If you don't already own this, I highly recommend that you check this out! It's that time of year again! This CD really helps ring in the holidays. The mood this CD creates is joyful at some points, solemn in others, yet overall Christmas-y. From her own takes on traditional tunes, to new incredible songs, Mariah and her wonderous voice shinge throughout the CD. This is a nice treat for Mariah fans and non-fans alike. You really don't have to be a fan of MC to enjoy this album. Many non-fans that I know greatly enjoy this CD. Undoubtedly, this is one of, if not the greatest Christmas CD of all time. So, treat yourself to a nice early Christmas gift, or if you already have this, grab a couple more copies and spread the holiday cheer to your friends! ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions, combined with its predecessors, marks the end a series of *modern* art.  Although the end clearly disentangles the real world from the machine world, it purposely leaves some questions unanswered.  I think it is clearly in the essence of the plot to allow people to gather their own facts to interpret and support their own pieced-together conclusion.  Although the movie targets general public with rather \\"easy\\" scenes and a quite \\"acceptable\\" end, there is more than that behind the Matrix.  A good *entertainment* movie usually brings the auditory into a stagnant state where they brutishly watch action scenes, comfortably in their stuffed seat, totally lacking any cerebral activity besides pleasure.  In Matrix Revolutions, the Wachowski Brothers force the auditory to go beyond easy entertainment and incredible CGI animations and actually DISCUSS about the movie once it is over.  I guess they were not afraid to answer ALL questions; neither did they leave holes for future sequels.  The movie simply wants you to play with your mind, which is worth a 5 stars!
B000089RVX|5.0|As a guy who has become so fed up with the music scene over the last 5-10 years...I totally gave up on any new rock bands having anything meaningful to say in their music and actually putting together an entire album of music worth listening to. Well it took a long time but Evanescence has delivered. I can't stop listening...It's almost like when I bought my first record back in 1981 and couldn't stop listening to it. This is amazing and I certainly hope people who have given up on good music give this a listen because a 20 year old girl from Arkansas will renew your faith...
B0000DZ3EA|2.0|HIT sounds exactly like what it is - a thrown-together collection of songs designed to fulfill PG's contract with Geffen, with no real thought or care going into the project.  A 2-disc set of PG's work sounds like a winning idea, but this collection could have been so much better!  As it is, HIT is vastly inferior to the single-disc SHAKING THE TREE: 16 GOLDEN GREATS released in 1990.  For starters, the track selection and sequencing on HIT seem to have been done completely at random.  There is no logical flow from one song to the other.  By stark contrast, the songs on SHAKING THE TREE fit seamlessly together to offer a well-rounded perspective on Gabriel's career (to that point, anyway).<br />It is an utter travesty that a set labeling itself as \\"The Ultimate 2-CD Collection\\" completely ignores Gabriel's masterwork, \\"Passion.\\"  You remember \\"Passion,\\" don't you?  The Grammy-winning, critically-acclaimed, universally-appreciated, ground-breaking album that ushered in the world fusion movement and launched the Real World Records label?  There's nary a sign that it even exists here.  Why couldn't they have replaced some of the MANY songs from UP with \\"Zaar\\" (which was included on SHAKING THE TREE) or \\"Different Drum\\" (which appears on the EU edition of HIT)?  It's a shame.<br />As for Gabriel's latest studio album UP, it was released scarcely a year ago and yet five songs - a full HALF of the entire album - appear on HIT.  Why?  I can only imagine the reasoning of the execs at Geffen: \\"Hey, nobody here in the U.S. bought UP anyway, so let's put a bunch of songs from it on HIT, alongside `Sledgehammer' and `Shock the Monkey,' of course, and hope that listeners will be intrigued enough to finally go out and get the album!\\"<br />There are some GOOD things about HIT, however, most of which have to do with the second disc.  Songs from OVO are surprisingly well represented (although a different version of \\"Downside Up\\" would have been nice, as the live recording here sounds murky and tampered-with).  The Steve Osborne mix of \\"The Tower\\" and the Daniel Lanois-produced \\"Lovetown\\" (from the PHILADELPHIA soundtrack) are certainly welcome additions.  Disc 2 is mysteriously titled MISS, which seems odd considering it contains \\"In Your Eyes,\\" one of PG's most well-known songs.<br />Here, in my opinion, is how HIT could be easily fixed:<BR>CD01 (just put `em in chronological order)<BR>1. Solsbury Hill<BR>2. Games Without Frontiers<BR>3. Biko<BR>4. Shock the Monkey<BR>5. Sledgehammer [video version as heard on SHAKING THE TREE]<BR>6. Don't Give Up (Edit)<BR>7. Big Time<BR>8. Red Rain<BR>9. A Different Drum<BR>10. Here Comes the Flood [piano version]<BR>11. Digging in the Dirt<BR>12. Blood of Eden [\\"Until the End of the World\\" soundtrack mix]<BR>13. Growing Up (TLA mix)<BR>14. More Than This (Edit)<BR>15. Burn You Up, Burn You Down<BR>CD02<BR>1. San Jacinto<BR>2. I Don't Remember<BR>3. Zaar<BR>4. Love to be Loved<BR>5. While the Earth Sleeps [w/Deep Forest]<BR>6. Family Snapshot<BR>7. In Your Eyes [\\"Say Anything\\" single mix, for a little variety]<BR>8. When You're Falling [w/ Afro Celt Sound System]<BR>9. The Tower That Ate People (Steve Osborne mix)<BR>10. Lovetown<BR>11. Father, Son<BR>12. Quiet Steam<BR>13. Downside Up [either the instrumental or a new studio version with PG on vox]<BR>14.

0345357116|5.0|Though Unfinished Tales cannot be read as a book in its own right, any one who comes to it after reading The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion will indubitably find it interesting, as the book gives various nuggets of information about characters, events and places that are only hinted at in the other two books; e.g. the chapter on the Istari. 'Old' legends or myths of Middle-Earth, like the actual story of Isildur's fall in the Gladden Fields, are given in their 'authoritative' versions. A number of other tales, like the history of Galadriel and Celeborn or the Black Riders' hunt for Frodo and the Ring, are told in different versions or from differing perspectives. <BR>A particular gem is the story of Aldarion and Erendis, the only story of Numenor before its fall. Through it, Numenor becomes a living place, not just a name from legends. <BR>A map of Numenor is also included in the book. <BR>A lovely book - no other words for it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|First off, I have never heard anything more from At The Drive-In than One Armed Scissor, and I was not impressed at all.  <BR>Then they broke up, and I wasn't terribly crushed.  The members without afros started Sparta, a radio friendly emoish pop punk band that sounds like Glassjaw light.<br />The members with afros, however, started The Mars Volta.  And this is their latest opus, a mix of progressive rock, punk, funk, dub, space rock, and probably a lot of other genres I can't think of right now.  When I first heard this, I hated it, but I listened to it the whole way through, and now I love it.  On a side note, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers plays bass on this album, and lends his own funky style of playing to an already eclectic mix of styles.  <br />If this album would have come out 30-40 years ago, it would have been one of the most influential albums, alongside Pink Floyd and Led Zepplin's albums.
B00005JMFR|5.0|there are way to many comic man losers from the simpssons making reviews for the revolutions.  the movie was out of this world... #1  the fight in club hell was excellent... #2 fight with the machines in the dock... made any other si-fi movie look amature... #3 epic battle with smith and mr. Anderson at the end was totaly mind blowing best action fight ever... #4 i garentee you could not make a better ending... that was the best ending i have ever seen!!!

0808514121|5.0|I have yet to read a poor Steinbeck book and I think this was his all-time best (Grapes of Wrath is a close second).  The author has an interesting take on the Cain & Abel story.  Basically, depending on which bible you read it has a different translation.  Depending on which you choose to accept, that is how you should lead your own life.<br />Great characters and impossible to put down.  One of the few old books where I have seen an Asian character as a very deep philosophical person.
0142437611|4.0|How is it that a novel of such importance, by one of our country's premiere men of letters, has been reviewed by only one other Amazonian? Goodness, the state American Literature is in. We are a country losing our soul, much as Tommy Wilhelm in Bellow's &quot;Seize the Day.&quot; This book should be appreciated by more readers, plain and simple.<br />Imagine a man. A child of a man, really, who never quite grew up and never took the time to know himself. He took pills instead. He took the easy route. He painted his life into a corner, and the paint... ain't... drying. Tommy can you hear me? Tommy, it's time to smash the damn mirror and all those bottles of pills and all the bum advice you take from that quack who lives above you in that New York Hotel where you have breakfast with your successful dad every day, the same dad who practically begs you to grow up and go back to your wife and kids and fix what's wrong in your life instead of blaming others.<br />Sound familiar? Sound like a parable for a nation gone fat with overindulgence and extended adolescence? And yet it's such a personal story. It's just one day in a man's life... a day-long trial for a man who can't make things right because he pushes when he needs to pull.<br />We all maybe need to push a little less and pull a little more is all I'm saying. Bellow's work represents a life so eff'd up that there may be no solution. Again I ask, sound familiar?
0142000663|5.0|Not as good as East of Eden but way better than most books.  The Joad family epitomized the wave of mid-westerners that were exploited during the dustbowl years by large farm owners.  You feel for them and hang on their every hope and feel their agony as they are used by shysters, on the way to losing everything they have.  The tale is so gripping and heart-wrenching!  Another example of why Steinbeck is my favorite American writer!
0141439513|4.0|I welcome this new edition from Penguin Classics with expanded notes.<br />How does one demarcate pride and prejudice, or bias and stubbornness? In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen deftly exposes the folly of and further ridicules judging by first impressions.<br />When Elizabeth Bennet first met the fine, tall, handsome eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy, she immediately deemed him arrogant, conceited and utterly obnoxious. Her first impression of Darcy, who was initially looked upon with prodigious admiration, was quickly assured as his conceited manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.<br />Darcy's conceit and selfish disdain of the feelings of others formed the foundation of Elizabeth's disapprobation on which succeeding events had built so inevitably a hatred. When she later found out Darcy had deliberately altered Bingley's opinion of her beloved sister Jane and determined to separate them, she was determined to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy.<br />In the comedy of manners that follows, Austen, in a superb manner and prose so elegant and lyrical, verbalizes the stubbornness, bias, and prejudices of Elizabeth toward a man whom resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of his admiration for her escaped him. Despite the fact that he struggled to maintain his composure, in his breast there existed a powerful feeling toward her, which soon procured her pardon and directed his anger elsewhere upon Elizabeth's weighty accusations of him.<br />Pride and Prejudice presents us a romance comedy with a modern feel and touch. The opening of the novel Fitzwilliam Darcy is blackened as the most obnoxious snob for whom \\"there is not another woman in the room who it would not be a punishment\\" to him to stand up with. To Elizabeth, almost all of Darcy's actions \\"maybe traced to pride\\" and \\"pride had often connected him to virtue.\\"  No sooner had Darcy's superiority of mind (pride) been fully exposed than Elizabeth's prejudicewas revealed.<br />Unlike her sister Jane, Elizabeth was more hasty in censuring anyone (especially Fitzwilliam Darcy) and never supposed the possibility of any extenuating circumstances in the case, let alone urging the possibility of mistake and misunderstanding. In confronting Darcy of his inexcusable act of separating Bingley and Jane, Elizabeth judged from assumptions, suspicions, and the biased first impression. In a sense she sought to discredit Darcy and the relation of events that might be capable of a turn which must render Darcy blameless throughout the whole affair.<br />When Elizabeth finally considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided Darcy, her anger and indignation was turned against herself and Darcy's dejection (more or less disappointed feelings toward her) became object of her compassion. Elizabeth's folly and rashness also become object of our compassion. How awful her petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br />Pride and Prejudice evokes the fact that human nature is prone to pride and very few of us do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or another. Pride usually relates more to our opinions of ourselves, of which Elizabeth has epitomized. Pride is the real superiority of mind, when along with stubbornness, bias, and determination, would casue irremediable regret. The novel also evokes the friendship, the values of marriage, and snobberies of English middle-class life in the early 19th century. 4.5 stars.
B000002C1W|3.0|Pink Floyd without Roger Waters is basically the Chicago Bulls without Michael Jordan; a good team but not a great one.  Here &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; tries their best to recover from Waters leaving the band.  Roger was basically taking over the band and some felt 'The Final Cut' was somewhat of a solo album.<br />'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' starts off awesome, but then falls short.  It become really boring and unimaginative.  At least they tried....
B000065BPB|4.0|I'm no audiophile, but I like good sound.<P>First, the other reviewers are right, they need about 48 hours of burn-in.  Originially, the bass was non-existant and the mids were \\"muddy\\".  Play music loud on them for two days and that mostly clears up.<P>Second, the bass is weak at very low registers.  If you have an equalizer (like in WinAMP), you should check the headphones' manuals to see how to adjust it for the best sound.<P>Third, the mids and upper registers are amazingly precise.  I have them plugged into my machine at work and I can hear the static coming through the sound card.  I had them plugged into the speaker's headphone jack, but that static was way too much, and had to plug them directly into the sound card.  I listened to a Dave Matthews' studio album and I can hear talk from the soundbooth as well as the band members conversing during the jam session.  They're that precise.<P>Fourth, sound from the outside is heavily damped, especially in the mid and higher registers.  I don't hear any computer fans.  I don't hear my officemate's conversations.  I still hear footsteps in the hallway, so some bass does get through.  At this time, I haven't tried them on a plane.<P>Fifth and last, they are noticable.  The weight is not too bad, because of a padded strap on top.  They do press a little too tightly on the side of my head.  (Some pressure is necessary to get a good seal to block outside noise, but these headphones have more than seems necessary and no good adjustment to releave it.)<P>So, good sound (if you don't need deep bass or have a equalizer) and good outside-noise damping.  They are tight on the head.

B00008WT5J|4.0|The album is fine, the remastering is good.  However, Shake Your Foundations has the edited (truncated) intro found on the Who Made Who Cassette -- as opposed the full song found on the Who Made Who unremastered CD and Fly On the Wall.  Just found it odd, all this money to remaster, and they use the shortened version of a song.
078322334X|1.0|Bad sequal to one of the great movie experiences of any time.  Speilberg should have stopped when he was ahead.
0920668372|5.0|We've had this book for a few years, but I hadn't ever read it with my daughter until last night.  It is a wonderful book.  It starts out with a mother and her new baby and she rocks him and sings him a little song about how he will be her baby as long as she lives.<br />Through the succeeding pages, the baby grows into a toddler, a young boy, a teenager and a man.  In every stage of his life, his mother sneaks into his room sometimes, crawls across the floor, picks him up, rocks him, and sings the song.  This is the part that some people find creepy (my wife included).  I think the problem is that some people just don't care to suspend disbelief and expect every book to be very literal.  Yes, a little old lady breaking and entering to rock her grown son is a little odd to us as adults, but if you approach the book as a young child, it might seem perfectly normal.  In any case, it serves as an effective symbol to show that the mother's love endures throughout their lives.<br />Of course, since the son is growing up, so is the mother, and you can imagine where this is leading.  When the mother gets too old to sing the song anymore, I broke down in tears right there reading to my almost four year old daughter.  We had a pretty good conversation as a result.<br />So, now you are forewarned.  I think whether you like this book or not is going to be very dependent on what sort of person you are and what sort of person your kids are.
B000002C1V|4.0|A highly underrated album that has been basically forgotten.  The brain behind The Floyd takes full charge in an album dealing with the sadness and aftermath of war.  Most of these songs are not marketable and that's why the album is not popular; Roger Waters created an album of his own vision rather than something the company or the public wanted.  Listen to it intellectually rather then for pleasure.  It will be quite an experience.
0385508417|4.0|As John Grisham is one of my favorite authors, and a friend had reccomended Skipping Christmas to me, I decided to spend a few hours reading this skinny novel.  I was told that it was &quot;hilarious&quot;, and even though it was September and nowhere near Christmas, I decided that I could use a light book to break me from the heavy reading I'd been doing.<br />I wouldn't really describe the beginning of the book as hilarious, but it did describe how Christmas has gotten entirely out-of-control.  However, near the middle to the end of the book, I found myself cracking up after every sentence.  If you're looking for a light and funny read, Skipping Christmas is a must.

6305971099|3.0|Beginning with H20, the Halloween series now completely ignores the events of Halloween 4, 5, and the Curse of Michael Myers, so these films fall into limbo.<br />Since they couldn't get Jamie Lee Curtis to commit to the middle films, they tried to follow the story of Michael killing off members of his family.  Halloween 4 is the best of the bunch, 5 is a step down, and the whole house collapsed with the appalling Curse of Michael Myers.<br />The redeeming features of 4 and 5 are clearly Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris.  Pleasance is totally game as the obsessed Dr. Loomis, and indeed, in this version he seems ready for the loony bin himself as Michael Myers once again returns from death to stalk the hapless citizens of Haddonfield.  If you recall, Michael was hit by a truck and shot about 100 times at the end of 4, but nothing can stop Halloween financier Mustapha Akkad from resurrecting his favorite son for some more trick or treating.  You'll also recall a bold move at the end of 4 to send the series on a different path and make Michael's niece Jamie take over the family business of butchering.  Once again, the producers went safe and dropped that idea, preferring to let Mike do the slaughtering.<br />Danielle Harris once again plays Jamie (the daughter of Jamie Lee's character).  She gives an impressive performance for a child actor in this one and is completely convincing as a terrorized 11 year-old that is now psychically linked with Michael.  I also liked the completely inept and moronic cops who exist to, well, die.  A shame they kill of Ellie Cornell, but the laws of slasherdom state that survivors of the previous film generally must die in the next installment just to show that like an elephant, Michael (or Jason, or Freddy) never forgets.<br />The ideas are definitely there, and people are game, but the execution is so-so. The look of the film is good--it has a real Halloween, autumn feel to it and was filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah. There is a subplot involving a mysterious man who is following the action and makes for an ultra violent ending.  (He and Michael share strange symbolic markings.)  By the end of 5 we get the bizarre image of Michael in a jail cell (with the mask still on!) before we get the cliffhanger ending.  Sad that it would take six years for a sequel to explain what happened.  The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) is terrible, an example of trying to over engineer a slasher series to embarrassing ends.  The score is by Alan Howarth and is not as good as the subtle soundscapes he contributed to 4, but he tries to inject some life into the famous themes and cues.<br />Part 5 is weaker than Part 4 and boils down to pretty much by-the-numbers slasher material, done with a bit more style and with some good acting.  Once again, it seems that they can't get the Michael Myers mask right, and this version is terrible.  Perhaps they try something different every time, but really, can they not just get a decent reproduction of the masks in Part I or II?<br />I like the approach they took on with H20 and Resurrection, but these middle parts have Loomis, whose obsession and pronouncements of 'pure evil' define Michael as much as the mask and the kitchen knife.<br />Definitely far from the series' finest hour, but recommended for die-hard fans, of course.  The DVD now includes a short making of featurette as well.ot involving a mysterious man who is following the action and makes for an ultra violent ending.

B00005JMFR|1.0|I liked The Matrix a lot.  I was cautiously optimistic about the sequal, and Reloaded exceeded my expectations.  I was blown away.  All that double-speak, plot twists, woven together into a brilliant storyline that incredibly did not contradict itself.  Revolutions was the first to disappoint.<br />Watching the movie, I thought several times \\"This is cool, but certainly the weakest of the 3.  Still, worthy as a means to give some closure.\\"  What you will get out of this movie is an understanding of what will come of all these characters you invested an emotional attachment to during the first 2 movies (Though you probably won't care when it is all said and done).  <br />My issue is the resolution of the story.  Without spoiling the movie, the most accurate way to describe it is a punch in the gut.  It knocked the wind out of me.  Before seeing this movie, I would have pre-paid for the DVD trilogy 5 years in advance (And I am not a DVD guy.  I rarely buy a movie, and even then I never buy new).  I don't even want to know the other 2 movies exist anymore.  This third installment sucked the life out of the first 2.<br />Imagine watching \\"Field of Dreams\\", with all that \\"If you build it, they will come\\" buildup.  Except it's spread out over 3 movies, with the tension and excitement and mysterious apprehension building minute by minute, movie by movie.  Then at the end, the field is completed (Heroic music playing) and some kids from around the neighborhood run out and start playing whiffleball and you're supposed to have a big warm fuzzy for the kids.  You'd be like \\"That was it?  All this buildup so he could make a playground for some kids?\\"  <br />The plot of Revolutions is NOTHING like this (Thus hopefully I have not \\"spoiled\\" your miserable experience for you), but the feeling is the same.  Deflated, and the thoughts \\"That's it?  Really?  You're kidding...\\" running through your mind.  And just as my proposed ending for a Field of Dreams Trilogy would make the first2 intolerable to watch (because all of the meaning is sucked out of the struggle), so this movie completely ruined the first Matrix and the brilliant Reloaded for me.
1573300403|5.0|This DVD shows anyone why MJ is the only King of Pop! Many of this more recent videos are showcased here, several that we were never even able to watch in the US.<br />The performance at MTV's Video Music Awards is worth the price of this item alone. Michael's breathtaking dancing, singing, and ad-libbing are simply ingenious!!<br />Additional must-haves include Scream (with sister Janet), They Don't Care About Us, and Stranger In Moscow.<br />I really wish they had included the original version of Blood On The Dancefloor instead of the remix, but it's still great to watch.<br />Highly recommended for any fan or music fan!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Room on Fire, to my surprise, is actually a solid CD. Particularly for a second album, which is always the hardest, especially for a group with as much expected of them as the Strokes, it's an accomplishment. While there's no &quot;Someday&quot; on this CD, there are plenty of very good songs, most noticeably &quot;The End Has No End,&quot; &quot;Reptilia,&quot; &quot;What Ever Happened,&quot; &quot;12:51,&quot; and &quot;Under Control.&quot; Not the best album ever, but it leaves enough for plenty to be anticipated for their 3rd album.
6303471730|4.0|I love this movie, I must have watched it a dozen times.<BR>I have both the DVD and the VHS copies and the quality is as good on both, I find. However, the DVD is over 1/2 an hour shorter, so I suggest you watch the movie before the DVD. After you have done then the DVD makes sense, and it shortens some of the longer scenes, though it does cut a important scene concerning the appointment of the cook.<BR>And for those people that say it isn't politically correct, for the majority of women it isn't these days, but I am a women and I agree with the whole thing lol.<BR>This movie is good and funny, and the more you watch it the better it gets!
B000001FGG|5.0|This is one of the Cream's finest albums, as was mentioned by other reviewers, but what I really want to say is this:<BR>How can you guys live with yourselves, writing reviews and then seemingly not reading them over again to check for mistakes? Or is it just that the majority of Americans can't write in proper English? One of the reviews for this album was posted by a guy who uses the word 'to' when he means 'too'...REPEATEDLY. Don't you people get taught this stuff in elementary school?<BR>I happen to come from the U.K., and if anyone in this part of the world who wasn't considered backward tried that, they would be laughed across the water.

Don't be afraid to use your brains, people; some things are worth pondering.<BR>People also have to get over this expectation that the sequels should  outshine the original. Face it people, YOU LEARNED WHAT THE MATRIX IS IN THE 1ST MOVIE! THAT PART IS OVER NOW.<BR>To those who are anticipating that LOTR: Return of the King is going to be tonnes better... It's not. I've read the lotr books many a time and as much as I like the story, what is the 3rd film going to have going for it? Good, Evil, War, Peace, Love.. All the same fundamentals except no thinking or insight required.<BR>I'll pay to see Return of the King and love it, but not as much as I've loved this Matrix trilogy!<BR>Also, untouchable effects!!
B0000027RL|5.0|In the early '90's there was a huge musical movement based from Seattle called grunge. The grunge movement had two bands at it's forefront, Nirvanna and Pearl Jam. While Nirvanna went sraight to the top of the mainstream charts Pearl Jam remained in the back ground. Ten was Pearl Jam's first hit album, it was also one of the first cd's I ever bought. Pearl Jam's always seemed to be alittle more poetic than Nirvanna to me, perhaps that's why I liked them more. I have always felt that Pearl Jam wasn't in the music business to make money, rather they just wanted to make music.

Today I was checking out some of the reviews, who pays those guys to write that stuff. Trust me, its well worth the couple of bucks for the hours of entertainment! Im sure to see it again, you couldn't possibly (like the first two) see everything the first time!<br />Favorite Movies! Way to go Wachowski Bros!
B000002B2T|5.0|Those who are questioning why it doesn't sound like Alice In Chains or Pearl Jam or Screaming Trees are missing the point. It wasn't meant to sound like any of that. <BR>Layne Staley's voice is one of the most recognizable sounds of the 90's and he was excellent on this record. It was not an upbeat record. It wasn't supposed to be. So, I suppose those who were expecting familiar AIC sounds would be disappointed. <br />Layne Staley was an excellent front man and song writer...and this collection is another example of that. <br />Greatness.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|What could be more depraved and disturbing than a superhuman evil spirit that only possesses women, turning them into vicious murderous hags, and can only be stopped by completely dismembering the possessed body, forcing a well-meaning young man to brutally murder his own girlfriend? Hmmm, if they'd been married for years, it might not seem that far-fetched. <br />This movie plays like a video version of an EC horror comic book. If this film doesn't creep you out, try watching it again on a large-screen set with hi-fi surround sound, at midnight with all the lights off in your house.   <br />I live in a heavily-wooded area, and when the spell that summons the Evil Dead was recited, all of the igniters on my gas range started firing non-stop, forcing me to unplug the unit. An appliance repairman told me that they just get stuck sometimes, but it still seems like an eerie coincidence.
B000002J2F|3.0|Not bad Not great.  Those are my thoughts on the Duke CD by Genesis.  There are some creative moments that reminisce back to the Peter Gabriel era and even Trick Of A Tail.  However, the melodies are just not very compelling.  The lead tracks Turn It On Again, Duchess, Misunderstanding, and Behind The Lines remain most memorable after four or five listens.  There are a few memorable moments from Duke's Travels, Guide Vocal, and Man Of Our Times.<br />Nonetheless, a strong CD(four-five stars) has a majority songs with something compelling to the listener.  Duke just gives me an OK impression with the strongest tracks and a ho hum attitude for the less memorable aspects.  Therefore 2 1/2-3 stars seems about right.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Both the DVD and CD get 5 stars, both are excellent, I can't say enough good things about them.  The DVD is the next best thing to seeing them live and the CD makes a great addition to their two previous CD's.  The previously un-released &quot;Moses&quot; ... which was written for the beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow, and &quot;One I Love&quot; make the CD alone worth the money.<br />I only have two problems with this collection.  One, the sound on the DVD is so much clearer than the CD.  Second, is the absence of &quot;The Scientist&quot; on the CD.  Then again, &quot;The Scientist&quot; is so much more moving when you can actually see Chris Martin at the piano, singing with all his heart.  <br />Overall, it is still a must have for Coldplay fans!

B00003CWN3|5.0|I watched this movie when I was 17 - young enough for this poignantly bittersweet (or should I say sweetbitter) story to stamp its unforgettable mark in my mind.  <br />Hilary's acting was stellar in this - yet in real life she's not at all like that butch lesbian girl she plays in this movie, and so I found it hard to re-adjust my impression of her after seeing her in other movies and in magazines with long hair and being feminine and all... The acting was so good that I honestly detested every single guy that appeared in this movie for being the horrible ba****ds that they were, even though (I know, I know) they are just actors and the real ones are out there and I don't even know how they look. But still... ironically if I'd met my husband back then I'd probably not even give him a second look.<br />This is one of those movies you either want to watch or can't be bothered to. If you're a guy who really can't be interested in spending some of your time watching a film about 1)a really butch Hilary Swank and 2)a tearjerking movie, then save yourself the trouble. This is a chick-flick in many respects - its theme is about lesbianism, and the fact that this was based on a real life story of Brandon Teena in a stuffy-minded town in Nebraska made it all the more depressing. I walked away hoping in my heart that she's happy now wherever she is. But then this didn't have to happen to her. So all the more it affirms the fact that life's not fair. <br />This movie is also studded with surrealistic blurry images which actually made the budding love story between Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny even more compelling... The soundtrack was excellent and suited this movie's scenes so well. Watch it if you like a semi-romantic and tragic drama... you'll never forget this. I never did.
B000059XUI|4.0|Superman must fight 3 ex-convicts that escaped from the Phantom Zone..the prison of the planet Krypton. However, Superman reliquishes his powers to marry Lois Lane. Can he go back to being Superman and save the Earth? Watch &amp; find out.
6305897786|5.0|I watched this not knowing what was in store for me, and at the end of the movie, I was completely in awe of this powerful story. Johnny Depp's acting is good, but his somewhat scrawny body and his aged looks just weren't the reason why this movie kept me in my seat throughout. No doubt the story isn't very realistic - its basically about the forces - mainly the evil forces - in life - greed, lust, power... and Johnny Depp plays an underhanded book dealer who is employed by Balkan (Langella) to go on a trip to Europe to research an ancient Satanic book's authenticity. This entire movie is about Johnny Depp taking one long and life-threatening adventure tackling issues beyond what he normally avoids in real life.<br />Emmanuelle Seigner (and this is just some gossip for you - she's Polanski's wife in real-life!) plays the mysterious woman who appears to help Depp everytime he's faced with a life-or-death situation, and this casts suspicion on her true identity - is she human or is she not? What is she? These are all the questions that Polanski poses to the viewer as you go through the film watching Depp go through his journey which seems to be like a cat-and-mouse chase between him and the greedy people who are after the book's secrets. Seigner is completely mesmerising in her own right. She is very interesting to watch and so charismatic - and rightly so because Polanski filmed her in such a way that drenched her in an even deeper aura of mystery. Olin is good too, she is very convincing in a somewhat shallow role as an out-and-out money-grubbing chic French tramp who bites (literally). <br />There are certainly loads of questions left unanswered in the movie, but I think this is the intention of the director who wants you the viewer to make out the story how you want to see it. If you like a movie that features a great cast (albeit not your usual &quot;teen heart-throb&quot; Hollywood stars) shot in an European countryside backdrop, and a theme about the &quot;darkforces&quot; that leaves you thinking a bit - then you're sure to enjoy watching this. This movie has good pace. There's always something happening around the corner for Depp, and then there's always the question of &quot;Who exactly is that *girl*?&quot; I loved this whole movie and would recommend it to the right person.
B00005JMFR|1.0|Why is it that stuff on television are written so much better than in the movies?  I watched Matrix Revolutions opening night absolutely excited for whats to come.  Sadly, I was so dissapointed -- I had expected so much more from the writers of the film. The last of the Matrix series did not deliver. It lacked the awesome story line I expected from the previous films.  Don't get me wrong -- it was action packed and the special effects were fantastic but at the end i did not feel that the characters were tied together.  I think part of the reason why the story did not hold as well was because it was spread too thin.  The producers released animatrix and the video game which had some answers as to how the matrix all began -- but since it was already marketed for the dvd and the game it was not included in the story line of the film. My personal opinion is that they put so much effort in making a hollywood blockbuster with the actions sequences that the soul of the movie was lost.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Al Pacino along with Robert De Niro are to me, 2 of the greatest actors in Hollywood since the 70s. Al Pacino is brilliant and unforgettable in this one (as he also was in Serpico) as the Cuban refugee who is uneducated, ambitious and without scruples. Mastrantonio acted out the role as sister so well, and the hint of a potentially incestuous relationship between them two was apparent from the start - when I saw the scene when Pacino visits his mum and sister for the first time in America, when he was hugging and kissing his sister for a bit too long and a bit too affectionately, I thought she must have been his girlfriend from Cuba! I never realised they were siblings until his mother was shouting at him to get lost because she &quot;doesn't want a son like him&quot;, that I realised these two weren't lovers. Such was the unspoken but truly well-played roles that Pacino and Mastrantonio took and this brilliance lingered on for the rest of the film. Michelle Pfeiffer too, is every bit the convincing bitchy coke-addicted vamp who is the object of 2 prominent syndicate members' desires. She was younger then, but she stood out. <br />The movie is fast, quite unpredictable at times, and full of guns, drugs and bloodshed. Not to mention its soundtrack and theme (and possibly storyline) must have inspired the idea behind one of the most popular Playstation 2 games on the market today -  &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; - because most of the songs in the PS2 game were the exact same 80s tracks that were played in this movie on and off. I am really impressed by this movie. Normally I don't go for gangster flicks, but in this case and in the cases of certain other Al Pacino and Robert De Niro gangland flicks... I make exceptions. I love these 2 actors!
B00005JM02|5.0|Toy Story was not bad, never saw Part II, liked Bug's Life, hated Monsters Inc. Finally Pixar gets it right.  This film towered over such huge fare like Matrix Reloaded and X-Men 2 to become the biggest box-office grosser of 2003.<br />Marlin, a clownfish, is a bit protective of his son, Nemo.  One day, Nemo gets captured by scuba divers and taken away to a dentist, with a rather unappealing niece(see: niece see fish, niece kill fish). So you got 2 stories: Marlin and his new forgetful friend, Dory, travelling through the ocean and coral reefs to rescue his son. Meanwhile, Nemo, in an aquarium, tries hard to break out, with his new friends.<br />One thing that a lot of animation studios, particularly Pixar does is combine kidlike humor with more adult humor.  Adults will laugh at pop culture references and the sharks 12 step program to not eating meat while it'll just fly over kids heads.<br />The animation is spectacular, nowhere near the ultra-realist Final Fantasy, but definately the most colorful film and vibrant: Marlin's coral home to the &quot;jellyfish forest&quot; to the australian current are so vivid and detailed you'll just sit back and wonder how long they took.<br />Definately take a look. Oh the package has both widescreen(disc 1) and fullscreen(disc 2) which I think should be instituted a lot more
B0000AXE8I|2.0|WORSE THAN THE FIRST.<br />(Rhyme NOT intended, bland flame not intended.)<br />Anyways, first off, yes Neo and Trinity DID pick up in their relationship, but they jumped too far at the beginning for me to bear. The rest of the time I was sleeping.<br />I understood it MUCH better than the first one, but the voicing is bad (think of when Morpheus says the word &quot;Machines&quot; during that speech, and you'll see what I mean.) As well as the fighting is really fake.<br />If this movie was supposed to be better, then I should have just said the first one was trash. the Agent Smith thing... wow, that was a bit.... much.<BR>Also, how can ONE guy suddenly pull a metal pole off the ground (Then again, in the Matrix anything is possible. Ha ha ha...) and SUDDENLY show immense skill with a bo staff and somehow KO a good percentage of this army of Agent Smiths?<br />Among the better things was the philosophy. I could take it. The talking was okay, in some ways, but the fighting was beyond unrealistic. It is like watching a rubber band fly off soem random gradeshcool kid's finger and fly into your face, I mean, really. You see, the fight scene right after we learned who the Keymaker was looked really rubberband-ish.<br />Other parts were just WAAAAAY too long, as well as the lack of emphasis on the plot and other preferences that would've been interesting, i.e., The Machines.<BR>In a war, both sides should have GOOD, substantuated(sp?) reasons to fight. Not just something like, &quot;Oh, hey, let's go attack the humans and enslave them since we're machines. Har, har, har.&quot;<br />The only part I thought really rocked was the freeway scene. I mean, really, that was the only super-great part that is still fresh in my head. Wow, I cna ahrdly remember Matrix I though, how come I remember this...?<BR>Oh, yeah, wait, if the rest of the parts weren't as good, one scene that was good (according to your peferences.) sticks out. <br />Otherwise, if there's just action and no plot, the movie/idea is easily passed over. Too much talking and no movement can also ruin a story/movie.<br />It was a good movie, but I can attest that the word movie shouldn't have been used as some SCENES only seemed truly memorable. (And for you sickos that like to see the stuff waaaay too early in the movie, the xxx scene.)<br />                       ~Kokeshi088~<br />P.S. Personally, I also liked that sword fight, sheesh, a lotta things are better with swords, in this case a *little* bit better.<br />P.P.S. Also, we can now prove that the character &quot;Neo&quot; (Keanu Reeves) does NOT have scoliosis, as proven in a certain scene that was a but... rushed. At least I think it was rushed. (They must do this stuff only to please people, right? It's almost like doing something silly and out of place just to win a bet, you know?)
B00005JMFR|2.0|To tell you the truth, I thought that the first matrix was and still is, one of the best sci-fi films of the last 15 years!!! it was unique, original and incredibly creative. for the second one, i have variated choices, it wasn´t great, but it captures the story and gave it a few new twists that were just amazing. But revolutions is simply, one of the worst conclusion of a trilogy ever!!!!<br />the story got so dumb and uninspired that the couldn´t manage to keep it firm and it went way out of hand. the first hour and a half of the film, there´s hardly any action, but stupid dialogue that was so repetituos that leaded nowhere!!! And it wasn´t just me, even my very best matrix die hard friends were deeply frustated!! The oracle was so bad this time that first I thought it was ajoke...how can she be so mystirious and still couldn´t help neo in anything...then the film goes into a animated battle so cheesy it was dumb!!!!! and the ending could be easyly the worst ever!!!! After this film, I think is going to be very hard for reaves to find a job....because he has proven in this one that he really can´t act!!! the movie was plain awfull!!!!!! in every aspect!<br />
B00008S2VG|4.0|I feel the biggest problem with American Life is that the songs are not complete. I notice that she's been taking many liberties with her songwriting style and structure since the &quot;Music&quot; album. Which isn't bad, but the problem is that on AL they sound like rough drafts. It's a good album, had it been finished it'd be a great album.<br />Madonna can make rather simple lyrics sound quite artful, but here she sounds preachy. This time her revelations aren't really profound considering they are rather obvious statements that anyone with common sense already knows: such as the media is sensational, materialism is bad, the downside of fame, love is all we need and I'm so above it all, blah blah blah. Well duh, love.  It took you 45 years to realize that?<br />&quot;American Life&quot;, &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;, and &quot;Mother and Father&quot; are the most atrocious tracks she's recorded in years. Madonna's ironic twist on rapping sounds embarrassing on the title track. Not to mention these tracks bring out the worst in Mirwais' producing. Don't even get me started on the lyrics.<br />That aside, there are a number of highlights on the album though, mainly coming from the folk-sparse electronica numbers. &quot;Intervention&quot; is the best song followed by &quot;Easy Ride&quot; (a song where Madonna comes to terms with her mortality). Other highlights include a passionate sounding Madge on the electric/acoustic &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot; (preachy lyrics aside, it's quite good), and her ode to defiant punk rock with &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot;. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is good but lyrically incomplete. The cryptic &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is the only time when Madonna totally rips it up on the dance floor.<br />For all it's flaws, the album is more consistent than &quot;Music&quot;. The latter was merely separation of experimental French electronica and folk; making the tracks sound like Madonna/Mirwais experiments. The former seemlessly blends the two genres together, making American Life more musical.<br />Madonna should continue to experiment with her music. Only next time, she should just do what she does best, make artful pop songs from the heart and save the preachy statements for her interviews.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|The Swimmer is one my all time favorite films. The DVD transfer is absolutely incredible. The music is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, haunting, sad, exciting. The film works as a sort of jigsaw puzzle. When Burt Lancaster appears seemingly from nowhere clad only in swimming trunks which he wears for the entire film, we know nothing about him except through the comments and reactions of the various people he meets throughout his journey. The supporting cast is excellent and the photography stunning. As the plot slowly unravels we learn more and more about his character. To reveal anymore would spoil the film. Highly recommended.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is the epitome of all hero journies. Although the story is simple, you could compare this to movie Star Wars or Lord of the Rings because they all have one thing in common: they all have a adventure where the main character is trying to get to his goal. I love all the Pixar movies but they all seem to have the same story pattern. 1. Something gets lost 2.) The main character has to find it. This is not a bad thing. Finding Nemo was the best movie of the year. I enjoyed it a lot. Please watch it if you like a good story and a great quest.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Just saw them twice in NY, one at a &quot;secret show&quot; I won tickets to. Bowery Ballroom, only a couple hundred people. Amazing. So much better than at MSG.  And this cd is ridiculously addicting. Reptilia, Under Control...I hum them all day long, wake up looking forward to hearing them again. Too cool. Too good.
0783226837|5.0|This move is the text book example of how to do camp.  So many movies go for camp and they forget to do camp right you have to be dead serious - yet with that twinkle in the eye and the tongue through cheek.  Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and crew - right down to Michael Gross and Reba McIntyre as the gun toting survivalists - are totally brilliant.  The movie is fast paced, with a lot of memorable lines like &quot;here are some Swiss Cheese and bullets&quot; that will keep you watching this movie again and again.<br />Val and Earl (Bacon and Ward) are jack of all trades in a small rocky mountain wide spot in the road.  They soon discovered giant worms from outer-space, that have super sensitive hearing and plan to munch their way through their remote valley unless our trust band of misfits can figure out how to make worm mush out of four of the huge things.<br />It's a great time to be had by all  Hey...you gotta have a plan, then maybe you could get on People Magazine!
B00005JMFR|5.0|I just saw this film, and I must say any and all Matrix fans will simply love it!  The movie picks up in almost the exact same spot that Reloaded ended at, and all the questions are all answered.  Those who claim the plot holes remain unfilled simply lose the nature of the plot within the twisting philosophy and constantly changing path of The One.  Stupid people will need to see this at least three times to even slightly comprehend the depth of genius that went into the film's creation.<br />First of all, the fight scenes are back in full force.  In many ways, they are not superior to Reloaded, but rather, they are much more innovative and even more compelling to watch.  The action is seemingly nonstop, and the tribal orgy scene from Reloaded doesn't exist here.<br />The creativity within the movie is simply mind-blowing.  Anyone  who appreciates creativity will easily recognize the massive imagination and innovation that the Wachowski brothers achieve with this film.  The machines that exist and the machine city itself is simply beautiful, and virtual reality has never looked so real.  This movie visually has no equal.<br />No one can pass up the opportunity to see this movie.  All flaws in Reloaded are compensated for, and the conclusion may prove to the best movie of the three.  Highly recommended!!!
B00005JLYW|1.0|Someone send Cameron Diaz a comb. If Drew were not a Barrymore, would be be showing up to smirk cutely in movies all the time? I know you're not supposed to take these things seriously but there's a point where they become offensive.
B00005JMFR|1.0|This review contains spoilers but it's nothing you couldn't figure out from the first 20 minutes of the movie anyway.  <br /> A student of mine told me that his friend at Warner Bros. said that this was terrible so I can't say that I wasn't warned.<br /> Oh boy, where to begin.  First off, I should mention the good stuff.  The battle between the machines and the humans, who are using other machines to fight the invading machines, is loads of fun.  If only the attack had occurred during the pointless orgy scene in \\"Reloaded\\".better yet, but I digress.  Suffice to say that any movie made by Bros. W., Spielberg or Lucas will always look great.  The action is good, now, does it really matter?  Also, Hugo Weaving is acting circles around the rest of the cast.<br /> Unfortunately, there are just too many scenes in this movie from other movies as well as the first two installments of this one.  Let's see here:  Bullets in slo-mo? Check.  Dance/orgy scene? Check.  Resurrection of a major character at the climax?  Check.  Signature John Woo scene of all the characters in a room pointing guns at each other?  Check.  Dudes in military exoskeletons a la \\"Robotech?\\"  Check.  Monica Bellucci's breasts squeezed in a so-tight-it-just-can't-be-good-for-her-circulation bustier?  Check.  <br /> The plot (which I will not discuss here) is pretty much pro-forma, not only can you see the story coming a mile away you even know what the characters are going to say before they say anything.  (But you knew I was going to type that didn't you?)  The dialogue is laughably bad for most of the first (as well as the second and last) portions of the film.  The scene in the train station with Neo and a family is unintentionally hilarious.  The writers seem to have reduced Neo's intelligence just below that of Homer Simpson, and for a character played by Keanu Reeves that's saying something.  The scene in the ship where an Agent Smith possessed character is talking to Neo was laughable.  (Hint to Neo: Only the bad guys greet you with \\"Hel-lo Mis-ter An-derson).  As much as I derided \\"Reloaded\\" I was mildly surprised by the scene with the architect, unfortunately, there are really no surprises here.  <br /> Some scenes are so bad I'm amazed that they made it into the film.  There is a shoot out that is a direct rip off of the first movie.  The scene in the gay bar/dance club/S&M hangout is actually WORSE than the Zion scene in \\"Reloaded.\\"  Why the Merovingian would open a gay bar when he's married to Monica Bellucci is a question well worth pondering.  Also, seeing men in latex pointing guns at Trinity and Morpheus isn't threatening, it's funny.  The Merovingian must now join Jar-Jar Binks in the ranks of the movie characters with hilariously, annoying accents.  Why he is even in this movie is a question well worth pondering.  (To the fan boys who are screaming that \\"He's really Hades!\\" I know but Hades is god of the dead, not the god of Purgatory.)  The death scene with Trinity was FUNNY!  I mean, she's having this conversation with Neo and the camera suspiciously does not show her torso so you can figure that she's become \\"Trinity-ka-bob,\\" but NO, when the camera finally does show her torso she's been skewered six ways from Sunday and yet still has enough life left in her to hold for a scene that goes on WAY too long.  (Second hint to Neo: Kissing dying \\"Trinity-ka-bobs\\" only hastens the inevitable.)  Now that she's out of the way, Neo goes on to meet Big Giant Head (or the leader of the machines who/whatever that is.)  So, Neo now needs to \\"jack-in\\" (I sure hope that William Gibson is getting some kind of kick-back for all the raping the Bros. W. have done of his work) one last time to fight guess who?<br /> If you've seen the first two parts, you know.  Needless to say, that their fight scene is a replay of their fight scene in part one except without the suspense.  Neo dies YET AGAIN and THIS time he's brought back by Big Giant Head.  Again, him dying MIGHT have meant something if not for the fact that nobody important stays dead in these movies.  <br /> This might have meant something if we felt more for the characters but we don't.  I think that Morpheus was the most interesting part of the first film but he is literally wasted in the sequels.  I didn't think that he was any closer to Neo than he was in the first film.  Indeed, they had more scenes together in the first installment.  Ditto for Neo's relationship with Trinity, they love each other.  So what?  I felt no sadness at her passing for the mere reason that their relationship never seemed to grow nor matter.  \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is a great story not only for the action but because it's easy to CARE about the characters.  Tolkein was a philologist and he knew that words meant more than their everyday, common usages.  Words have histories, so did his characters.<br /> Finally, the score manages to rip-off BOTH \\"Mars\\" from Holst's The Planets as well as Orff's \\"Carmina Burana.\\"<br /> If you're up for some nice fight scenes and don't give a rip about character development, go ahead and see \\"Revolotions,\\" but I'd recommend a couple of Coronas first.
B000009EAD|5.0|i could waste ur time and mine by writing a massive review using big words that noone out there really cares to understand or i could just tell u to buy this album along with anything else that has ICED EARTH written on it.  when u listen to iced earth u r listening the the greatest musical creation of all time.  and for ur info, these metal gods hail not from denmark,sweden or anywhere else in europe but from america.  what the hell r u still doin here!!!!!!!!
B00005JLXE|3.0|On one level this is a very lavish movie that's jam packed with action.  Yet on another level this has so little substance that there's not really much of a story to get involved with.  So without a story you basically end up with a movie full of props, and not much more.<br />Some have compared Daredevil to the comic book and have pointed out that this really comes across much like reading frame by frame.  I think that's true, but then again this is a movie and not a comic book.  A movie needs a bit more depth to make it worth while......Hopefully they try again, but with a different director.
B00005JMFR|3.0|It's sad that a movie trilogy that had the potential to be the Star Wars or Indiana Jones for a new generation just boils down to three movies that get progressively worse starting with Reloaded. <br />The action and adventure aspect of revolutions is right on the mark. During the main battle sequences the action was impressive. But often it was cheapened by the inclusion of characters you really felt no connection too. Often the Wachowski's reverted to action/sci-fi stereotypes for their characters. These stereotypes where so blatant that one wonders if the Wachowski's were trying to play to certain groups. <br />Another theme that is played out is the whole idea of \\"the one\\" or some messianic figure like Neo being crucified like Jesus Christ. It's sad that so much philosophy used in the first Matrix was completely lost in this final movie. We all knew that Neo was \\"the one,\\" but then to realize that there were other Neo's before him; it left the door open for a whole relm of posibilities and they chose the most obvious one.<br />I am not sure if this movie was catered to a specific audience for revenue or to plug some up coming online game (Matrix Online), or purhaps a comic book but this movie is a disappointment in the end.<br />I wouldn't suggest buying this movie on DVD or VHS unless you absolutely MUST have a completed set. (...)I really wish is was worth more but frankly the movie was fun to watch but not mind expanding in the least.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|They have the look and the sound, but that's about it.  The music just comes off as generic and so does the songwriting.  There is none of the fire and inspiration that infects good rock n roll.  I listen to this and it just feels forced to me, right down to the song titles.  This has all been done before, and its been done alot better.  The industry is becoming flooded with bands like this thanks to The Strokes.  Buy their new album instead.  Or dig back a little ways and discover some of the classics.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Not as good or as mind blowing as the original, but way better than Reloaded. There is more action in this film than the first two combined. The ceiling shootout at the Club Hell, the 20 minute epic battle against the machines, and of course Neo's final rain-soaked confrontation with Agent Smith are great and worth admission price alone. If you were dissappointed with Reloaded, don't give up hope just yet. Revolutions is why we action fans go to the movies!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Matrix. It brought movie entertainment to a whole new level creating a new type of film genre, indeed. That may be in fact why I hated this part so much. Gone is the excitement of the first. This flick seems to be a rush moneymaker for some big Hollywood honchos. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity continue their fight against the machines, however the plot doesn't seem to have purpose. In between various fight scenes are a few sexier scenes and some random placement of 'philosophical' scenes. All of the scenes are too long and seem to lead nowhere. The scenes in the first all compliment each other and bring in the next scene. The fight scenes are also inferior to the first. The movements aren't as fluid and seem slowwww[...] (...) This is one sequel that should not have been forced. The storyline has a lot of potential. It just seems that deadline was approaching and this drivel was dished out instead. Some parts are so far fetched so that they just seem ridiculous. I am a big fan of The Matrix and this is probably why I don't care for this flick. Everything that made the first so special is gone. This is just another example of marketing sequels that don't do the series justice in order to cash out on die hard fans. Maybe the third will be so awe inspiring I'll forget how bad this one is.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|She has the voice of an angel but seems to be bereft of new ideas. 'Afterglow' was much anticipated but invariably it has left me cold. There is nothing new here, It's just Sarah McLachlan by numbers. Thats not to say that it is a terrible album, it's just that it seems she has gone into the studio with a list of Sarah-isms and worked her way through them, Use the word 'Heaven' in lyrics, Check, Use the word 'Reverie' check, Self-loathing ballads, Check. The list goes on.<br />You could take this cd out of it's case and put it into any other Sarah Album and you wouldn't notice the mix up straight away. Simple because it is a case of same old same old.<br />After her 'time-out' I expected more, something a little different, but she seems to have found her comfort-zone and is sticking to it. Which is sad because her work with Delerium revealed that she could crossover into different genre's effortlessly and make an impact.<br />Anyone new to her work will no doubt love the album but once her back catalogue gets delved into people will think that she is a one trick pony , which is sad because she has one of THEE most beautiful voices in the industry.<br />The three stars I give the album are basically so new fans will not be dissuaded from checking it out, because if this is your first contact with the artist you will love  it, but for the fans who have been around for a while it's not so much Lilith fair as same old fair.
B000069CWE|5.0|From the makers of Hybrid Theory came Reanimation, turning what most thought would be a remix in almost a different album.  The new tracks are definitely a plus, and Pts of Athrty and Plc. 4 Mie Haed are definitely two songs I could see Linkin Park making a lot of money from (soundtracks, videogames, quotes for track shirts, etc.).  The remixes aren't just different beats to the same flow of words on the same time scale; new lyrics, new beats, and a pool of talent(known and unknown) bless Reanimation with a long awaited, solid mix of rock and hip-hop.  As far as being a remix album goes, Reanimation should be the standard for anyone thinking of remixing anything.  A must have for fans of rap/hip-hop or rock.  Albums like these help break down the walls that separate American culture.
B00005JM02|1.0|&quot;Reviewer: Jordan Schroeter from Grafton, Wisconsin United States<br />This movie is awsm my favorite, favorite part is when their in the submarine and the shark is chasing them and the shark hits the door and dory goes (Who is it?)&quot;  what are you like 5? You belong in the &quot;Kids Forum&quot; idiot.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Charon beckons you to an apocalyptic monastery where dark beasts dwell in the shadows. Such gothic trappings are essential elements in the filthy bowels of David Fincher's spiritual heir to Ridley Scott's original nihilistic vision. Cameron's steroidal Rambo no longer, Ripley is once again a strong woman trying to survive. Medieval dungeon prisons awash in slime, the primordial playground of bestial inmates. Raped by the bodily invader of her(and our own) worst nightmares, our dynamic heroine must make the ultimate sacrifice in a pregnant image of birth and destruction, a bloody abortion for us all. And honestly, who wanted Hicks and Ripley's maternal issues back for the sequel?
B00007GZWO|4.0|While Cirque de Soleil is amazing to see on stage, there are some things that can be done on film that don't make it on stage. This is not just a performance of incredible acrobatics, but a story filled with wonder, tragedy and love. The music will haunt you for days afterward, and the feelings stirred in your heart will bring more life into your days.

B00005JMFR|5.0|It's amazing how the Warchowski brothers stayed true to their philosophy throughout all three Matrix movies. We realize early in the Matrix that the Oracle can only guide you to \\"the path\\", you are always required to make a choice. As the Architect states in Reloaded, the Oracle is an intuitive program designed to examine the human psychie. Through her examination she learns to appreciate the attributes of the human \\"spirit\\", and concludes that when given a choice, humans generally choose the \\"right\\" coarse. In contrast, the programs are driven by purpose, as each program is created to perform certain responsibilities. She realizes that machines and humans are co-dependent, as the machines artificial intelligence will never be capable of simulating the human spirit, and thus she strives to end the machine-human war. She does this by perpetuating the \\"unbalanced equation\\" through several generations of the Matrix, until a specific set of circumstances arises, through a series of human \\"choices\\" (guided by the Oracle), that would bring peace. Realizing that the battle between Neo and Agent Smith is inevitable, she allows herself to be merged with the Smith program. The confused look on Smith's face during the cloning of the Oracle indicates that the process did not go as he expected, and likely a residual of her program was implanted in Smith, similar to Smith's implanting into Bane after his exit from the Matrix. Thus, during the climactic fight scene between Neo and Smith, his attempt to clone Neo results in the melding of the residual Oracle program with Neo thereby deleting/destroying all remnants of the Smith program. <br />As far as Neo's assumed powers outside of the Matrix, after his encounter with the Architect within the Source, he remains partially, perpetually \\"jacked in\\". This allows him limited ability to \\"hack\\" any programs connected to the source, e.a, sentinals, and \\"bombs\\". His apparent ability to see the machines after being blinded by Bane/Smith, is accounted for by his continuing link to the source.<br />But then again, I'm just a Matrix fanatic. :)
B000089RVX|5.0|It's great! Live, on the radio, on CD, every one of their songs are amazing. Beautiful lyrics, and Amy Lee's voice is unmatchable. Her voice is just as lovely as it is on the CD as it is in real life. It's a pity mine got stolen, I can't wait to get a new one!!
B000099T2L|2.0|Aside from &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and maybe a couple others, the songs on this album are no good.  Although Beyonce has an amazing voice, the songs on this album don't show her vocal ability - I was very dissapointed with this album because I couldn't beleive how many tracks I had to skip because I just wasn't feeling it -
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan gracefully returns after nearly 5 or 6 years absence with &quot;Afterglow&quot;. I've been a long-time fan of Sarah's music but I did not really love &quot;Surfacing&quot; as an entire album. There are no surprises on &quot;Afterglow&quot;, just classic Sarah. Vocally and musically, Sarah is at peak form on all the songs. There are no weak songs on this CD. You can easily listen through the entire album without skipping any tracks. There are no jarring tracks, so there is great flow through the entire CD. I've read some reviews that criticized &quot;Afterglow&quot; for lacking variety and being too mellow. However, I found the consistency through the album to be a strong point. I also think that some listeners (who do not listen carefully) misunderstand the peace, calm, tranquil confidence that Sarah exudes for being too mellow, disinterested, or lacking passion. Anyone who begs to differ should listen carefully to &quot;Stupid&quot; where Sarah's vocals convey fiery passion and sorrow. The instrumentals and vocal arrangements are superb, as usual, throughout the CD. Even when Sarah is not at her best, she is still better than most of the rest. &quot;Afterglow&quot; is the &quot;answer&quot; that her audience has been waiting for during her respite. With heavenly and soulful whispers, Sarah's &quot;answer&quot; resounds clearly and loudly that she continues to &quot;burn bright&quot;.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|All the Things she said is a pretty catchy song.  I found it stuck in my head a lot.  Beats me about the rest of their stuff.
B00005JM02|5.0|This DVD packed with two CD, DISC 1 Wide Screen, DISC 2 Full Screen.  I can watch the full screen fomated on my old TV, watch the wide screen fomated on plasma TV.  Not just that, this DVD's THX sound just like in the theatre with my Bose System.  Two thumbs up.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Especially &quot;stakker humanoid&quot;. He is most likely a Christian who was misunderstood Tool's message, yet he continues to spread his ignorance. I suggest you ignore such reviews, and concentrate at the beautiful, well-performed music at hand. Trust me, this is one album you don't want to miss.<br />Mr humanoid, please silence yourself to avoid further embarassment to yourself. Your simple-minded views are not welcome.
0812550706|5.0|I took this book along with me on a &quot;milk run&quot; from Seattle to Nova Scotia on three flights (last minute travel arrangements) I read it in one sitting - which I have never done with any other book. It had me from page one through to the end. I was caught up and stunned at the ending. <br />Some people like to take shots at this book because it is rather simple. To them I say &quot;go write something better then&quot;. It was a great story that didn't try to be more than it was with hidden meanings and messages that requires a degree in English to figure out. This is an action packed book that I may read again I liked it so much. If you have a collection of Sci-Fi this has to be part of it or you have your head in the sand. As for his other books...they don't hold a candle to this. This book was so good people will run out and buy anything he writes for the next 20 years. Read this one and feel safe skipping the rest except Ender's Shadow. Read that just to top up your Ender's fix. :)
B0000AQZYM|5.0|i bought this movie only cuz my wife wanted it so we watched it and i really liked this movie it is worth the money the effects are really good and everything it's a overall good movie
B000089CJI|4.0|&quot;Such Great Heights&quot; is an amazing, perfect song.  The first time I listened to it, I fell in love... and everyone I played it for immediately fell in love with me...<BR>If you like, Flaming Lips, King of Convenience, Mansun, or Pulp, this is a garunteed must have.<BR>i expect more great things...
B00008LDPU|5.0|The animation is excellent throughout, both computer-generated  (CG) and hand-drawn.  If you're a busy person this is perfect for you because you can watch one or two shorts at a time and come back later to watch more.  It's a great visual experience that is also thought-provoking. There's some occasional eye candy as well. I give The Animatrix my highest recommendation.

B000024O2Q|4.0|I'm sure this is an awesome cd, but I wouldn't recomend ordering from Amazon because their shipping is horrible.  I ordered this cd 2 months ago, it was supposed to be here within at most a month.  That's all I have to say about this cd.  It's a sweet greatest hits album but maybe go somewhere else to buy it.
B000089RV6|5.0|when this album came out in 1980 people were not expecting much from the thunder from down under.. especially after the death of original singer bon scott.  Well everybody knows what happend after that.. back in black has become one of the best selling albums of all time and one of the best rock and roll albums of all time.  Every single song on the album is great. my personal favs are back in black hells bells and what do ya do for money honey,  i suggest you by the record if you like rock n roll or hard rock..  The best hard rock album of all time in my opinion
B00005JMFR|1.0|Too much describes several aspects to the finale of the overrated Matrix trilogy.  Too much hype.  Too much philosophy.  Too many special effects.  Too much money spent to go see the movie- as the Wachowski brothers were way over their heads with this one.  \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" solved perhaps 5% of the questions brought forth from the previous movies.  The problem arose after the first movie- they should have just stopped right there.  The second movie contained too many new characters, theories, and philosophical/theological topics and references.  In doing this, they raised the bar of expectations for the final movie to a level that the brothers could not hope to reach.  Several key characters make brief appearances at best, and the new ones introduced have no major purpose after the scene in which they first appear.  On the plus side, the fight scenes (which were few and far between) were phenomenal, and the special effects were unbelievable.  Unfortunately, the positive factors end there.  No closure was brought forth when the credits started to roll, and everyone in the theater breathed a sigh of relief when the doors opened.  The bottom line is, don't waste your money on this one, and if you haven't seen \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" don't bother to, just enjoy the breakthrough film that was the first Matrix.

B00003CY6M|5.0|This movie was a great movie.  I don't believe it was a chick flick, because I viewed it with some heterosexual male friends who liked it a lot.  After the movie was over &amp; I asked my male friends if they thought it was a chick flick &amp; they said &quot;no&quot;.  One of my male friends said that the relationship that John Cusack's character had with his buddy (the obituary writer) saved the film from being coined as a chick flick.  Any man who has had a good male friend, whom he shared the details of his love life with, can appreciate this movie.  Any man or woman who has ever been in love can appreciate this movie as well.  My favorite part of the movie was the end, which some people don't realize, but Cusack actually cries when he reunites with Beckinsale's character.  For a romantic comedy, or any movie for that matter, this was acting at its finest hour.  Can you imagine meeting someone and losing touch with them, whom you believe may be the love of your life?  Have you have dreamed about him or her day and night for years, wondering if God will allow you to be reunited?  Did this longing ever cost you your fiance'?  This is truly a powerful film, probably more than the writers, producers, and directors even realized.  This acting is just as powerful as its theme.<br />What was equally intriguing was the soundtrack.  Annie Lennox's remake of Bob Marley's Waiting in Vain was supreme.  David Gray's &quot;January Rain&quot; was simply divine.  &quot;January Rain&quot; was played when Beckinsale &amp; Cusack's characters were finally reunited.  It is a beautiful song and it will surely move you to research his cds, as I have, and purchase them.  I have come to love the musician David Gray's work, and if, as an artist, your work is an expression of who you are, then I love David Gray too.  You all will find and appreciate the treasure of his music and songwriting.  Someone should have won some awards for the movie, the soundtrack, or both.  I am certain that anyone who has ever loved someone can appreciate this movie.  If you find that you can't, perhaps you have never been in love or allowed yourself to be in love.
B00008A7QK|5.0|I just received Electric Warrior and what can I say?  I was blown away!  I knew who Marc Bolan and T.Rex were growing up in the 70's but didn't know much about them beyond Get It On and a few other songs.  I did have a crush on Marc!  Anyway, I always wondered what happened to them.  I did some research and became very interested.  Based on the many reviews I read here I decided to start with Electric Warrior.  What a fantastic disc!  There's not a bad song in the bunch and the bonus material is wonderful.  How Raw Ramp didn't make it onto the original album is a mystery to me.  Mambo Sun, Cosmic Dancer, Planet Queen and Life's a Gas are some of my other favorites. How anyone can call this Glam is beyond me.  It's really funky electric boogie and many of his early music influences can be heard here.  Marc Bolan was a true Superstar.  His charisma and love of life really shine thru.  It's fun and infectious and you can't help but dance!  I only wish I had looked into T.Rex back in the 70's.  I really missed out on some great music.  I'll have to catch up now. I'm so glad I bought this disc.  I can't wait to get Slider!
B00005OAIE|4.0|For a 4 star rating, you'd think I love the cd, but let me say a few things.  I've read a bunch of these reviews and I must admit the comments are just as interesting as the music itself.  He is hated and adored but not much in between.  Many musician types (like me, but not me specifically) keep saying John Mayer is too teeny bopper with a guitar, or that he's too sappy and gutless. The album does have some over-sentimentality that comes off as a bit gratuitous (but pleases females).  John is a guy who can play the hell out of an acoustic guitar, HAPPENS to have a singing voice like Dave Matthews, and is apparently a little too easy-going.  I very much admire his lyrical ability. He can say things in a very effective poignant way, although the lyrics can seem contrived at times.  With lines like &quot;I could have met you in a sand-box&quot;, it's evident he was thinking of how he could score as much tail as quickly as possible with the girls in Lit. Class.<BR>     I think what many critical people about the album are trying to say, but aren't aware of is that John IS very talented but also too smart for his own good.  In other words, he knows exactly what he's doing when he plays the shy goofball (I do it all the time).  If he is to ever gain full respect for his talent he will have to put aside all the nice, nostalgic things of his adolescence and start digging a little deeper.  I'm sure this will come with age.  For the moment he's singing to all the good girls and boys, and middle aged moms, but eventually he will have to start singing solely for himself.  I hope he does because he has a unique sound and perspective, though both have a little growing up to do.  But that's normal.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|The wonderful thing about any Sarah McLachlan CD is you don't have to hear it before you purchase it. You know it will be incredible. No disappointments here.  Sarah delivers beautifully written music once again.  Her intense lyrical content draws you in and takes you on a journey.  Obviously, Sarah has gone back to her old sound.  Fallen, her first single, reminds me of something from &quot;Fumbling Toward Ecstasy&quot; which was easily her best album.  Sarah surpasses most songwriters in music today. I applaude her effort and gladly welcome back something of substance in a world overrun by pop nonsense.
B000001EUN|5.0|The Scorpions have never been all too good with the fairer sex. Their misogynist lyrics and album covers came to a head with this album, 1980's Animal Magnetism (well maybe not album covers if you think about Virgin Killer eww)..<br />If one wants to enjoy the Scorpions, they have to set those things aside because according to the parties involved (including Uli Jon Roth) it was kind of all an act.<br />But enough of my yapping. Animal Magnetism rocks. Hard. It has a rough, raw feel but looser vibe than their previous album Lovedrive, and while a bit more unfocused, the songs are almost a bit more memorable. No Michael Schenker here, he was probably really drunk and recording his first solo album at the time anyway. He dropped the ball on these guys. Songs like \\"Only a Man\\" (Clinton's excuse), \\"Hold Me Tight\\", and \\"Don't Make No Promises (Your Body Can't Keep)\\" exemplfy the sleazy attitude of the album, but are probably the most rocking songs on the album as well. The Zoo, well let's just say its a fluke that it was a hit. Its not their worst song but its a bit pedestrian considering the other songs on the album. \\"Lady Starlight\\" continues in the traditions of their seventies ballads, however with no Uli Jon Roth it doesn't match to songs like \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\". Its still a great song, with an orchestra taking the place of Uli (!) and a slow burning solo from (Rudolph sounding a bit like his brother) Schenker.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Sarah McLachlan is gorgeous.  For anyone who is new to her music, I encourage you to start from the beginning. <br />At the very least, you should explore the intoxicating world of her third album, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, which showcases the range and scope of her musical ability like none of her other albums.  The lyricism and vocal prowess displayed on Fumbling are still worth exploring ten years later.<br />McLachlan has always been folk-pop, but, first with Surfacing, and now Afterglow, she has crossed over entirely into pop.  Perhaps the only stand-out songs on Afterglow are Fallen, and Answer.<br />On Afterglow, McLachlan's voice is still both haunting and comforting- and incredible combination -but she is somehow subdued.  The album just lacks the fire and perceptiveness of her previous work.  And, as another reviewer also pointed out, the album lacks variety, both musically and in its storytelling.  The lyrics are forgettable, and the melodies redundant.<br />McLachlan's earlier work (Fumbling, Solace, Touch) has earned her a place alongside the great storytellers who write with a ripe and raw heart, and a fierce wisdom beyond their years: Joni Mitchell, Tracy Chapman, Dar Williams, Natalie Merchant, Jonatha Brooke, Indigo Girls, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Tori Amos, among others.<br />If, however, you have more of a pop sensibility, along the lines of Dido, The Corrs, Norah Jones, Jewel, Leona Naess, Everything But the Girl, and other artists whose heartbreak comes across more like rain-streaked-window blues than Holly Golightly's Mean Reds, then you might like the lightweight feel of Surfacing or Afterglow.<br />Either way, you should definitely discover the ethereal Sarah McLachlan.
0767903862|5.0|This is an amzing book. I bought it before the Olympics, stopped when the Games started... and didn't pick it up again (a few thousand other books and activities got in the way.)<br />Look, if you want to get all the details on Australia or any other subject that Bryson has covered, then buy the typical guidebook.<br />If, on the other hand, you want to share the experiences and interests of a brilliant, humorous, and above all else, curious, human being (who can write with the brief clarity of Kurt Vonnegut), then buy this book!<br />As a younger man, before the metal in my back, etc etc, I would have wanted to run or bicycle across countries. Now, walking is fine by me. In fact, reading this kind of book is enough exploration for my life now.
0783232039|5.0|For those who don't know Chucky's background - he came to life when a serial killer got gunned down inside a doll store. It was then when his soul passed to Chucky.<BR>In this movie, Chucky is as evil as always but surprisingly this time he ends up killing &quot;bad guys&quot; but he enjoys ruining peoples lives.<BR>Seeing a doll marrying another doll was more funny then scary. They even make love and kiss with tongues and that made me laugh out loud. It's just to funny but you really must be over 18 to watch this movie. It scared a sh. out of me despite the funny side of it.
B00005JMFR|2.0|The action and effects were great, but the Matrix presumes to be something deeper.  It turns out that it's just confusing mush.<br />There's a lot of talk about choice and purpose and love--and if this trilogy is to mean something it ought to say something.  And you think it's going to.  But it doesn't.  Smith asks Neo why he gets up, why he continues to fight.  Neo just says, \\"Because I choose to.\\"  Ridiculous.  Is that all the Wachowskis want to say?  After all the interaction of choice, destiny and love, Neo ends up a pure existentialist?  Again, I say, ridiculous.<br />And to top it off, Neo's \\"choice\\" results in peace with the machines.  Peace!  Are you kidding?  After the wonderfully rich set up of the machines as symbolic of the way our own pride, ambition and hubris can blind and enslave us, the result is peace with the enslaver?  Huh?<br />They should have stopped with just the first one.  They got completely lost with the next two.
B00000JSJC|4.0|I really enjoyed Strange Days. At first I had to get over their depressing view of a present-future New York that is essentiall a police state where people getting shot in crowds hardly makes people pause. I thought Ralph Fiennes was excellant as Lenny(not to mention very pleasing on the eyes and ears- he is aptly named). At first it was hard to care about his character, but as the movie progressed I began to empathize with him. Angela Bassett was also wonderful as Mace, his friend who becomes his love interest. It was nice to have a female lead in an action film that did not need a knight in shining armor, but actually rescues the hero. To be honest, I was more into the romance between Mace and Lenny. Their history together could have been better developed, like how Mace went from grieving single mother who waits tables to a limo driver that kicks ass on the side and how Lenny got kicked off the LAPD and became a wire head. Despite their sketchy past together, the romance comes to a satisfying end complete with a bloodied but still oh so fine hero laying a nice long smooch on his woman. The action was also a bit more unpredicatable than most action films which was nice.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I picked up this movie from the comedy section. I had absolutely no idea that it'll leave me sobbing after all the laughters I've had by watching it.<BR>Guido, lives in Italy and he's a remarkable man with great sense of humour. He meets his principesa by accident and soon she becomes his wife and gives birth to a very bright boy. Then the bloody Nazis show up - Guido and his son are taken away in the camps and then Guido's wife joins their fate too but she's kept seperate from them.<BR>Guido is a very caring father to his son and from the very beginning he keeps telling him that this is only a game so he wouldn't get scared from this absurd but most of all so his son couldn't get killed by damned Nazis.<br />I've probably seen hundreds of movies on Jews sufferings. I must have read hundreds of books too - sad ones that would break my heart into zillion pieces but only after I've watched this movie I realised that I lacked the 100% sympathy to Jews for what they've gone through from sadistic Nazis. God damn them.<br />I know from my own experience that wars and racial hatred are totally wrong but it was only this movie that really taught how bad wars can really be. Just how many nice,remarkable,full of life people like Guido were killed in wars until now?!?<BR>I wonder will they ever stop...and in case they don't I truly hope there'll be wars in which Greed,Hate,Jealousy and Fear would get massacred - not people. Only then Life would have been beautiful.
0385507755|4.0|I have only just started this book but am freaked out by the dental surgery this guy endured without anesthesia. I understand(I think) that addicts in recovery cannot have narcotics for anesthesia/pain b/c it starts the whole craving cycle up again but surely there was SOMETHING thy could have given this man. He may be a drug addict but he is still a human being. I would not do that to my dog. What if he'd suddenly developed chest pain and they found he needed emergency bypass surgery.....now they wouldn't have split his chest open without anesthesia would they? I'm not crazy about his writing style but I am compelled to keep reading this tragic story.

B00008S2VG|4.0|Dear Madonna,<br />Is this a cleansing of the soul, a poem written on the underground wall letting us in on your life thus far? OR is it simply more of the same, another chameleonic exercise to baffle us, just passing the time? <br />However this album is to be perceived, it stands as a recorded testament of Madonna's ability to shift copies. Number one just about everywhere, though without staying power at home.<br />Do I like this album? Yes. The sound is consistent throughout (except for the Bond theme, which is its own reward). The best albums usually have a uniformity of sound, a defining style which captures the mind and heart, and makes you want to possess it. <br />American Life does have a definite sound, a style, its insistent rhythm driven by co-producer Mirwais to reflect and emulate the current hip-hop/electronica/house trends.<br />Individually, however, the tracks aren't as strong as previous Madonna albums - except for &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Love Profusion&quot; - but even they take time to absorb and cherish. The much-maligned title track suffers from an unusual arrangement, and is better heard on the Oakenfold remix, although Missy Elliott had some fun with it as well. <br />But, that song does seem to come from the heart; OR am I naive, is she having us on? That's the intriguing characteristic of &quot;American Life&quot;, and of Madonna. Maybe a few more listens, with an aged port as company, might reveal the truth.. We'll see.<br />Yours<br />A fan.
0156027321|5.0|In the book _Life of Pi_, Piscine Molitor Patel confronts issures of faith and survival.  The story follows a young boy who struggles for an identity within his family and within the realm of God.  In fact, the Main Character's name was one of the first challenges that he faced, and formulating his own identity, used the symbol Pi.  The setting begins in the youthful nation of Pondicherry, India, where Pi's father was a zookeeper.  The time spent surrounded by the zoo animals measured the childhood of Pi, which yielded valuable lessons that would one day save his life.  The adventure begins in the second half of the novel, when the Patel family and many of the zoo animals board the doomed Japanese cargo ship Tsimtsum.  As the author of the book, Yarn Martel simply states, \\"The ship sank,\\" and by divine intervention, the life of Pi is spared.  In the chaos created by the freed animals and the panicked crew, Pi is thrown from the sinking ship into a lifeboat; he is then confronted with an angry hyena, an injured zebra, who jumped from the ship, a sea sick Bengal tiger (Richard Parker), and a kindly orangutan (Orange Juice), who had spent time in Pondicherry searching the head of Pi for ticks and fleas.  In the small vessel, on the vast Pacific Ocean, life once again is confronted with death.  The journey at sea is marked by Pi's grief and struggles with fate an faith and full of sybolic phenomenona such as the floating island of Eden.  Pi is saved at the story's end, and recounts the adventure not once but twice; one with animal sea mates, another with his mother and rogue sailors.<br />Is the story true?  It is as true as life and art can be.  The tale speaks to the reader, who may never know life aboard a small craft in a large body of water inhabited by wild animals, but by the end of the book, the reader will have held their breath, cried, laughed, rejoiced, and prayed to any God that the heaven's may hold.  The account that you will cheer for most likely will beteh one with Richard Parker and Orange Juice, it is simply too hard to face the brutal survival tactics of a vessel carrying only human beings.  The two stories parallel one another of the the voyage; humans juxtaposed with animals, and allow the reader to resist the potential judgment of Pi's shipmates.  After all, when hungry, what is else is tiger to eat but a hyena?<br />The book's treatment of the adventure and struggles with faith is fair and exceptionally done.  For example, Pi does not rely solely on Christianity for his source of strength; instead, he fills his days with prayers to Atman, Allah, God, Mary, and Jesus.  Within each religion there are parables, and Martel craftily incorporates many of them into the 227 days that Pi was a castaway.  The island for example will speak to devoted Christians, Hindus, and Muslims of the ancient confrontations of man, nature, and a supreme being.  But non believers, those who look to their own self for inner strenght, will be inspired as well.  It is foremost an account of what a man will do when faced with the question of his own survival.<br />The diction of the book is artistically rendered.  First, the author speaks directly to his audience in the \\"Author's Note.\\"  Although this portion of the book is tinted with the fictional quality found in his story, it too has the real occurrences of life imbedded within.  While it is a singular dialogue, the reader will feel as if he is involved in an intimate conversation with Martel.  He explains that he too was on a journey, and that he found his direction while in India.  The culture of the land that surrounded him inspired Pi's adventure.  Martel has organized his book in a chronological manner:  he follows the journey of Pi as it is retold to the rescuers.  Thus, the story is a reflective tale of the narrator.  The book's conclusion ironically returns and reinvents the beginning.  It leaves the reader with the choice of dealing with the world as symbolic or realistic.For the symbolic, Martel has left no stone uncovered, he has added meaning throughout that is waiting to be discovered by the reader.  An example of this laden text is found in the ships name, Tsimtsum, which literally means the withdrawal of God in the Kabala.  It may be concluded, then, that Martel is asking the reader:  \\"What would you do in the face of adversity, when you fell alone, would you turn to your God, or would you perish alone?\\"<br />Should you read this novel?  Of course:  there are lessons to be learned, as Pi showed us, from the everyday occurrences of your life, to the extraordinary adventures that fate may lead you to.  Pi Patel has survived an ordeal, whether it was with a tiger in the boat or a carnivorous French cook.  Additionally, Pi shows us that no man is able to lean on himself alone:  the world and ocean are too big and proof that there is something more to be contemplated.  The question of what is up to the reader.  No doubt, upon completion of this novel, each person will reflect on their own life and struggles.
B000002LIX|5.0|From the opening public (Spanish) announcement this album reaches for the heights, storming the senses through a succession of hard rock tracks before (arguably) climaxing with the majestic &quot;Three Days&quot;/&quot;Then She Did...&quot;.<br />Just as I'm beginning to think Perry Farrell sounds like Robert Plant on speed, he catches your breath with his soulful delivery on &quot;Three Days&quot;, before diving back into the mix after Dave Navarro's breathtaking guitar pyrotechnics.<br />&quot;Of Course&quot; and &quot;Classic Girl&quot; ensure this is a five star album, an unqualified Rock masterpiece.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have been into Sarah since my freshman year in college when Fumbling was owned by ever college kid on my hall. Nine years, a surfacing, a lilith fair, a mirrorball and a long and much deserved rest later, Sarah McLachlan digs back into the past and resurfaces with an album that is both timid and kind of shocking.  Many reviews say this album is too mellow or it sounds too much like Surfacing, but what resonates most when I hear this album are the most luxurious moments on her second album Solace combined with some of the haunting elements of Fumbling and Surfacing.  I am one Sarah fan who did not obsessively LOVE Surfacing because I jumped on the Sarah boat long before her 8-million selling opus Surfacing was released and thought it was more for the masses and less for the underground Sarah 'word of mouth' fan.  <br />The title Afterglow is perfect because after all the fame and exposure, here is an album that certainly doesn't lack any consistancy nor does it lack the style that longtime Sarah fans have come to expect and BEST OF ALL, it does not feel like a mass marketable album.  This album is Sarah going back and revisiting her early recording days and literally resurfacing with an album greater than the sum of it's parts, an album that people who don't know her work will ask 'hey..this is gorgeous and intense, who is it?'  <br />Afterglow is a celebration of everything that began with Touch and climaxed with Surfacing.  It sonically attempts to answer what does an artist do when they have a mega-selling release and still maintain integrity as a songwriter and artist.    <br />Fallen is an instant Sarah classic that bleeds into the amazing World on Fire that sounds like the creative child of both Solace and Fumbling.  The next track, Stupid is an intense and passionate track that harkens back to B-Side's Dear God.  This is aptly followed by the beautiful Drifting and the layered alto-soprano droll we all love that fumbles into Trainwreck, containing one my favourite sarah chorus' written to date and a sonic compliment to Surfacing's Black&amp;White. <br />Answer is the Answer to Surfacing's Angel.  Push is a tender love song that I have no comparison to make.  Time, on the other hand, is a complex track filled with more layered vocals that I adore and rhythmically similar to Solace's Shelter.  The album closes with Dirty Little Secret that can only be described as a cross between Surfacing's Full of Grace and B-Sides Song for a Winter's Night.  If you love Joni Mitchell and Sarah, this song is an absolute delight.<br />So let the critics balk at this disc and let the die hard surfacing fans be disappointed.  This an album for the fans who have appreciated all of Sarah's works, not just one album.  After hearing so many elemnets of prior albums on this disc, I really feel it is journey back to take a step forward.  The music world and lovers of music have waited long for this album to be released, and it is an absolute pleasure on my ears and my soul....like every single release this amazing artist has produced.
B000006SGT|4.0|A &quot;complete&quot; compilation of the band's Mickie Most productions, from the wild organ-splashed version of John Lee Hooker's &quot;Boom Boom&quot; to the superb &quot;I'm Gonna Change The World&quot; (Note: Track 21 on CD-2 is listed as &quot;New Year Radio Spot&quot; but is absent on my copy).<br />Among the obvious hits, such as &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, are some rare treasures, including the full-length version of Ray Charles' &quot;Talkin' 'Bout You&quot;, Eric Burdon's impassioned reading of another Charles song &quot;I Believe To My Soul&quot;, and the Price-Burdon treat &quot;I'm Crying&quot;, the 'forgotten' follow-up to &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;.<br />While the Animals were not unique among their British contemporaries in capturing the sound and feel of American blues/r'n'b - see early Yardbirds, Rolling Stones and Who, and especially Them - they translated this into an authentic emotional texture to create a hybrid &quot;British Blues&quot; sound worthy of the original purveyors. <br />The interplay of Eric Burdon's blues-shouting with Alan Price's blues-drenched keyboard playing is startling, evidenced by tracks such as &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, &quot;I'm Mad Again&quot;, &quot;Bright Lights Big City&quot; and the apochryphal &quot;We've Gotta Get out Of This Place&quot; (originally demo'd by co-composer Barry Mann in an arrangement which sounded more at home with the Top-40 pop stylings of the Hollies or Herman's Hermits than the raw blues power of the Animals).<br />The 40 tracks on this set (mastered for CD using &quot;No-Noise&quot; remastering, which gives a clean, if flat, sound)are presented in recording-date sequence, from their first blues-based e.p. session in January 1964 to their final Most-produced single in 1965, &quot;It's My Life&quot; bw &quot;I'm Gonna Change the World&quot; . <br />The Animals would quickly change musical direction after the split withMickie Most in 1965, covering a broader spectrum of musical styles (and fads) including San Francisco psychedelia (&quot;San Franciscan Nights&quot; &quot;Monterey&quot;), anthemic-rock (&quot;Sky Pilot&quot;) and guitar-driven rock (&quot;When I Was Young&quot;, &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot;).<br />However, the legacy of Micke Most &amp; the Animals is perfectly captured on this set, and remains an essential, and enduring, snapshot of 60s British rock. <br />**** 1/2 stars. Remastering needs to eliminate distortion evident on the closing organ passage on &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; (eg: deluxe edition of &quot;Who's Next&quot; removed distortion from Roger's Scream on &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;), and the remastering doesn't quite capture the depth of sound (the grittiness) of the original vinyl recordings.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This was the best trilogy that ive seen in my life. I loved the 1st movie and I thought reloaded was even 3 times better. The third movie is still great in a different way. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone who loves action and mixed with mind twisting.
B00005JMFR|1.0|what a waste this was the first matrix was awsome the second one was a tad weird and had me wondering a few things but i figured  3 would fix that so i held on. the 3rd one all i can say that was good about it was teh apu's the humans use were cool i like mech stuff but still every thing on this one seemed rushed like the producers and studio were like hey guys come on u spent to much time messin a round get it out now . what a waste shame on the dir for messin up a great story and goin with a basic hollywood ending .
B00006M183|5.0|Now that Pearl Jam and Matt Cameron have got the feel for each other musically I believe that they are absolutely unstoppable. This now evolved and mature direction has paved the road for us to walk. With Eddy's soaring, strong vocals. The absolute genious three guitar parts that include Mike's wailing guitar solo's and stone's powerful riffs with Ed backing. Ament's phenominal bass lines. And Matt Cameron's drumming which really hits the marrow of the bone. Another great thing is that everyone in this record had a chance to write a song. I think that its great this band hasn't chosen there music to revolve around one person to which you can truly hear a band.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|This review is about the Collector's set specifically.  If you already have the Special Edition DVD you already have the exact same 2 discs that come with this set, but if you want to have it all then this is the set to get.  It includes a collectible film cell, a small booklet containing the transcript of the movie, and a nifty book like case.  The extra features on these disc are outstanding (again, the same features you get with the SE DVD); the animated menus are hilarious and I especially like the lego rendition of the Camelot song.  <br />The one thing about the collector's set that's kind of annoying, they have only one peg to put the DVDs onto so one of your DVDs is put directly on top of the other one.  The top disc tends to fall off the peg and could potentially get scratched in shipment (like my first one did before I exchanged it); also when you securely fasten the discs they can be kinda hard to take out.  Just an annoyance but probably the only way they could've put the discs in this kind of book like case.  Overall, a great gift or personal purchase if your a fan and want to get the definitive set with collectible extras.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I admit I went into Firefly biased. I am a huge Joss Whedon fan and love his quick wit. However, though I intended to support his new endeavor no matter what, I was pleasantly surprised that Firefly's quality equalled that of Buffy and Angel. While some may scoff at these shows because of their content (stories of vampires, demons, space travel and gangs of do-gooders are seen as somehow beneath them), few that actually took the time to give it a chance were dissapointed. This series was hilarious and definatley underrated. I can't bring myself to understand how sitcoms about the exact same subjects and written the exact same way are continually put on the main networks. Inevitably they are cancelled - or worse dragged out over two or three seasons of horrid repetition. The dynamic shown in the characters' relationships of Firefly and again that sharp humor characteristic of Whedon made this show work well. But what made it great was its completely new concept. Most stories have that old western flair of good vs. evil, complicated hero with love interest(s) and many battles. Only this show didn't try to hide from its roots. It openly acknowledged and even exploited this connection, giving it a completely new flair that was only properly appreciated after its time. Few critics ever gave Buffy any credit, yet it lasted for seven seasons and could have gone on longer if the cast had not been ready to move on. If anyone has doubts about this show because of its concept, I challenge them to give it a try and see if you can't at least commend the excellent writing, if not grow to love it.
B00005JMFR|1.0|It is very hard to write a review of this movie withoout spoilers, because the ending is SO bad, SO hackneyed and SO familiar thats it reduces the entrie series to a mundanity and a waste of 6 hours of our lives.  Suffice it to say that this story ends up as exactly the same story almost all of  you have heard many times before.<br />Save your money,  Go to church and hear the same story for free!
B00005JMFR|5.0|I've got to say I'm really surprised at the amount of bad reviews for this movie.  I think this one is AS GOOD as the first one, which is a surprise after watching reloaded.  The action scenes are just long enough to be absolutely amazing, without getting redundant (Except perhaps the last fight scene).  The battle in Zion is far more interesting than I ever could have imagined (After being in the Matrix, I would of thought reality would be boring.. not so).  The intensity is such that the visuals and story become literally jaw dropping, as was my state during about 1/3rd of the movie.  There are some painful drama scenes, and is it just me or is no one entertained by Trinity's and Neo's fake relationship?  No matter, the positives of this movie are so grand that the negatives can not hold the movie down enough to be anything less than a success.  There are still some deep comments here, but they are hidden deeper than were the messages in the first Matrix.  Perhaps a few more viewings are in order.<BR>This movie has moments of pure beauty, drama, action, and humor that will surely be worth the price of admission.  And when it's over, you'll be craving another viewing of the first two movies too.
B00005JMFR|1.0|For anyone who doesn't know, a \\"SPOLIER\\" is a review that gives away some of the secrets of the media reviewed.  if you don't want that, don't read this...<br />REVIEW STARTS HERE<br /> I must admit, I was intrigued when the Wachowski brothers released the animated matrix prequel \\"The Animatrix.\\"  It clearly reversed roles and cast the humans as the original aggressors against the machine intelligences and the architects of their own destruction.  This appealed to my leftist instincts and left me actively wondering why they had made this moral twist.<br />Alas, the end of the third and final film, Matrix: Revolutions, makes it painfully obvious.  Stretched out in cross-position, the finale of this story is Neo goes back into the matrix to face his evil-opposite the now virus-like Agent Smith.  And how does he defeat him? By allowing Smith to win, thus, in his death, opening a path for the great machine intelligence into which he is also connected to come into the world and wipe away all the evil.<br />Just in case we MISSED it, the Mouse character (always a \\"true believer\\" in \\"the one\\"), on seeing that the war is over and the machines have turned around and are going home announces for all to hear \\"He's SAVED us!\\"<br />Oh and incase you missed THAT, we get to see Neo's body carted off on a suspiciously altar-like by the great Machine Intelligence and a holy electronic glow surrounding him to let us know he is ascending.<br />COME ON!!!  I've only see this story about 3600 times.  By reducing their man v. machine epic to yet another twisted Gospel the Wachowski brothers have reduced their story to the most trivally mundane and left me feeling I wasted 6 hours of my life getting to this point :(<br />And the Animatrix?  In case it wasn't obvious, thats the Original Sin.  Can't be saved without an Original Sin you know.<br />**sigh** I really think they just ran out of story material after the first film and so stole the most obvious story they could.  They should havequit with the first film which, while far from perfect, at least wasn't mundane.<br />In the words of my to-be-preisted wife:  \\"Lame!\\"<br />In its defense the movie does have lots of beautiful 3D animation and other digital effects.  Its somewhat ironic that the commercial my movie theater showed before the picture featured a stunt-driver because, if this movie has any long term significance, its to signal the death of the stunt man as a profession.  It has become so cheap and so easy to do it all on computers that its not worth risking a  human for.<br />Maybe thats the ultimate man v. machine story that the Wachowski brothers missed.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I just walked out of Matrix Revolutions half an hour ago. one word: DISAPPOINTING. and not just a \\"waking up on cristmas day and only finding underwear\\" disappointing. i mean, as i walked out of the theater, i wanted to cry, but there just weren't enough tears. look, i'm a huge Matrix fan, ask anyone. i own the other two movies, the Animatrix, the game, and the soundtracks for each of these. even with the majority of people saying the game and Reloaded were terrible, i defended them, and i will to my grave. BUT, this last one will forever taint whatever fond memories i had of these things. i gave this movie an extra star just for the action scenes. the epic battle between Zion and the machines was awesome, the fight between Neo and Smith was awesome, and the fight in the Merovingian's place was awesome. i even liked the whole \\"world between the two worlds\\" thing and the extra stuff about the oracle. but what was up with the philosophy speeches. look, i don't mind a little philosophy in my movies (in fact i encourage it), but come on, repeating the same lines over and over in a pointless effort to make them understandable is just annoying. and the ending, if you could call it that, killed it all. we were promised all our questions would be answered, and, i have to admit, the Wachowski brothers delivered. but they tricked us. they just gave us more questions without answers, and then they crammed them into the last ten minutes. it wasn't even a real ending. it left everything open...AGAIN. this whole series of movies, short films, and a game brought us right back to where we were at the beginning of the first film: not knowing what happens next. i personally felt cheated and used. it was all a gigantic, well-marketed tease. and with absolutely no talk of another film, it seems the questions will never be answered. i'm going to go lie down now and try to forget that a third movie was ever made.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have no idea what some of you are talking about when you say that Incubus made a pop album and sold out.  If anything this album goes in the opposite direction of the popular nu-metal genre that many people clustered Incubus into.  This album simply shows the maturity of the band.  This is not only the best Incubus album, but it is one of the best albums of any type period.  It has a great mix of harder tracks and a few soft, yet excellent songs.  I bought this shortly after its release in 2001 and have listened to it constantly over the past 2 years-it simply does not get old!  There is so much variety for a single CD.  Many bands fade away cause their songs all sound the same but that most certainly does not apply to Incubus.  Whether you like the old Incubus CDs (which are all very good) or not, I recommend this CD.  This CD is not just for rock fans, but for anyone who appreciates good music.
B00006LLJ4|2.0|I suppose this movie could have been deeper if I was intoxicated but, unfortunately I was not able to get into it as much as I thought I would have.  <br />Tom Cruise certainly has a way to catch the audience with his facial expressions and active moments throughout the scenes, but it is not enough to make you sit still throughout the movie.  In fact, you would probably want to change to regular TV about 20 minutes into it.  There is too much going on for a plot that seems to be so simple... Mystery with drama(extremely exaggerated).  I know the director wanted high-tech scenes and special effects...but give me a break.  Maybe if the special effects weren't so much, the director could've concentrated more on bringing the authentic storyline out.<br />The conclusion of the movie left me as blank as the emoticon on msn and emotionless.  Don't take my word for it, watch the movie.  Film is a form of art, but this is definitely a piece that has left a frown on my face and my head cocked to the side.<br />Enjoy.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I would describe myself as a fan.  This DVD is far better than I even hoped it would be.  This is almost better than a live performance -- and the group's live concerts are the best with a sound quality not captured on regular CDs.  A great addition to any Coldplay collection or any current rock/pop collection. The version of &quot;Clocks&quot; on the DVD is superb.
B000069HK2|5.0|this album is like Pearl Jam's first album Ten....<BR>meaning, every song is great and full of passion...these guys are one band i'll be keeping an eye on.....<BR>every song is good and i dont tire of them, the best features of this cd is the incredible feeling with which the singer delivers and the music is pumping.... i like the lyrics, and his vocal style is original, he does alot of screaming, which isnt orignal, so i dont refer to that when i say original, but rather the phrasing with which he lays the vocals over the music is very unique to him, another singer like the was Shannon Hoon of Blind MElon.....<br />great cd, go buy it and listen to it until its your favorite
B000089RVX|5.0|I havent heard a voice like this since... Well I've never heard a voice like this.  The music is a bit dark, but it blends perfecly with the vocals.  Back to the lead singers voice it is sooo beautiful and yet somehow a bit troubling at the same time, like the beauty comes from some inner pain. Very powerful. I am buying this cd (been listening on yahoo) and i haven't bought any cds in years. The reason i havent bought is more becuase of a lack of interest in new artists than anything else.  Evanescence is a special group.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Anytime I think Brett Ratner might have done a better job with a film than Ang Lee, there's a problem. I don't know what the heck movie Ang thought he was making, but this ain't the Hulk. It was suprisingly uninvolving. Everyone in the film seemed to be taking valium or something. Where's the passion? Muted. Totally bizarre in a movie about the unrepressed ID. That's what it was about, right? And it had big dogs and rock monsters or something? <br />Even the effects were substandard. The Hulk looked fake and cartoony. Too bad this film came out *after* Two Towers' Gollum raised the CGI acting bar into the stratosphere. The Hulk is on a level well below that character, obviously an animated creature everywhere he appears.<br />Lastly, I don't ask for much physics accuracy in my superhero movies...but when a guy swings a 120,000 pound M1 tank around by the main cannon--which would have snapped off like a toothpick--my suspension of disbelief, like fantasy tank, flies off into the distance and is smashed to flinders.<br />The Hulk as directed by Ang Lee is misguided and bizarre.
B00005JMFR|4.0|The apocalyptic finale of the Matrix epic--it is exactly what I had expected it to be. Though it does not set a CGI benchmark like the original Matrix, it is much better than Reloaded and brings the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Dont get me wrong--the CGI is mindblowing yet you do get a sense of deja vu when you see the movie--unlike the original Matrix theres nothing new here which you havent seen before. Also I felt there were quite a few elements from the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings in the main structure of the movie--I dont want to give away any plot details so I dont get into the parallels--if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about.<br />But the plus point is the story--it is a beautiful, thoughtprovoking ending which true to the Matrix tradition remains bound to mystical Eastern(predominantly Hindu) ideas of the \\"end\\" and \\"beginning\\". It was also nice to see the Matrix pay tribute to the Hindu ideas of \\"maya\\", \\"karma\\" \\"trinayan(mind's eye)\\" and \\"srishti\\" (creation) by introducing a Hindu girl in a pivotal \\"oracle\\" role. Matrix needed to end on a bang and yes I can say that it did.<br />Yes the movie will be criticized. People expect new standards of CGI with each matrix and these viewers may feel let down. But for guys like me who want to look upon Revolutions as a movie and as a finale to an epic rather than as a showcase for the latest graphics tricks, there is nothing to complain.The movie can also be criticized for not closing some of the big debates of the role of the Architect and such---but I am sure the geeks will have some gigantic interpretation out soon. In any case Reloaded went too heavy on the metaphysical stuff and lost the audience somewhere down the road. Revolutions restores balance--they keep it mystically heavy but dont slam your head with conundrums--after all this is a movie not an algebra test !<br />My greatest criticism is that the movie gets too maudlin at times with protracted death scenes and mushy dialogue. And there were too many love stories inserted as side plots which detracts from the main stream of the story. But at least we didnt have anything like the ecstacy-induced group sex thing we sat through in Reloaded---thank the Architect for small mercies !<br />Performancewise the Matrix series has never been one to write home about. Keanu Reeves pulls out his stock expressions which run the gamut from a to b while the rest of the cast performs in a standard fashion. Only exception is the scene-stealing Hugo Weaving as Mr Smith----now he kicks some bigtime butt--crackling the screen with his deadpan expression and knuckle-gnashing dialogue delivery. <br />In conclusion, Matrix Revolutions is a more-than satisfactory conclusion to the Matrix story---maybe it lacks that sparkle that elevates a movie to motion picture greatness but it satisfies and gives you your moneys worth ! Now for how many movies can you say that ?
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I returned this DVD. Reason? Same as so many others. The commercials. Yes, you can fast forward through them, but what nerve from Universal! The only way they're going to stop doing this kind of thing is if we all become criminals and download movies illegally, OR deprive Universal of their money by not buying their products. I saw Animal House, I liked Animal House...but not enough to surrender my hard-earned cash for a DVD full of advertising and a snapcase full of coupons. That's a bum deal. Maybe if it cost $3.98 it might be a different story.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I saw the special showing of the dvd in theatres and now I have it on my own dvd. I seriously have watched it five times in the past three days since I got it. I definitely recommend this title to any fan of coldplay. It's definitely worth the money paid!!!!!! Everything is so good. The way it is shot. The quality of the performance. The tour journal. Everything. BUY THIS TITLE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!! :)
B0000AXE8I|1.0|A truly long-winded diatribe against Virtual Reality game playing....waste of 9 hours of time....the special effects are spectacular, but because of them, the script is sacrificed.  Very sad, especially for those who enjoy game-playing, too preachy to be worth anything.  Save your bucks.

B00005JMFR|5.0|I have to admit that ive spent waaaay too much time with my buddies and bros after Reloaded trying to guess what this movie would hold....man, were we off!!! (although I did dig my theory that Neo could lock into the Matrix wirelessly, kinda like WI-FI) I will also admit I was a bit worried whether the brothers could wrap this up in two hours, and yet leave us with enough eye candy.....WELL THEY DID IT....im so impressed with this movie on so many levels....<br />As far as my take, It has to be when the Oracle tells Neo that he and Agent Smith are one and the same, exact opposites of each other.  I think that the reason Agent Smith dies at the end is because in order to keep the balance of both of their existence, Neo's sacrifice of himself to save the people (no need to tell you about the religious undertones here) ultimatley kills Agent Smith as well, because Neo's existence had to balance out Agent Smiths existence.  (Im gonna have to watch this again...and again, and again)<br />The War scence in Zion was magnificent...and had the whole theater cheering at its close(I remember the frustration I felt was so real when the second wave of machines made theyre way through...not to mention the end fight scene between Agent Smith and Neo was absolutely brilliant... <br />There are many religious undertones to the conclusion of this movie, mainly dealing with faith(Oracle's belief in Neo,<BR>christianity/judaism/islam (Ressurection of Neo and his sacrifice for his people) and even some Hinduism (the belief of reincarnation, much like the recreation of the Matrix six times) and lets throw some good old Kharma into the mix for good measure.<br />Absolutely fantastic.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Before battling the forces of evil, Clark Kent faced his greatest challenge: high school. The WB's engaging hit drama has finally arrived on DVD. A devastating meteor shower strikes the peaceful town of Smallville. For most of the townsfolk, the event brought great losses and unexplainable results, but for the caring Kent Family (John Schneider & Annette O'Toole), it blessed them with an amazing gift: a son who will become Earth's greatest champion. Producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar have developed an original and appealing twist to the Superman myth. \\"Smallville\\" is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the young Clark Kent (Tom Welling) adapting to his superhuman powers, his friendship with future arch nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and the developing relationship with sweetheart Lana Lang (Kristen Kreuk). The series is a surprising mix of coming-of-age drama and comic-book fantasy. \\"Smallville\\" also features a top-notch cast and stunning visual effects. The first season of \\"Smallville\\" definitely keeps viewers entertained but too many \\"Villain of the Week\\" episodes give the show a repetitive nature.<br /><br />Fans of the WB drama will be satisfied with \\"Smallville: The Complete First Season\\". All 21 episodes of the first season are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its picture quality is quite bright and reasonably sharp. The Dolby Digital 2.0 sound is satisfactory with decent surround effects. The box set includes two commentary tracks by series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, several deleted scenes from the pilot and second episode, \\"Storyboard to Screen\\" featurette, an interactive tour of Smallville, some promotional material and DVD-ROM extras. Overall, \\"Smallville: The Complte First Season\\" scores a \\"B\\".
B00003CXXJ|4.0|It's a great family movie. It's prety much fine for any body. just make sure if you don't want your kids introduced to so called foul langege make sure to plug jr.'s ears now and then. My final opinion is great movie. worth buying. Can't wait for the next one.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|As a fan who has been anxiously waiting since Mirrorball for a new Sarah album, I'm disappointed. It's truly a good album, but the songs sound too much like each other, and too much like Surfacing. Her previous works had so much raw emotion and originality-- this seems too mainstream, too much like it was thrown together to meet a deadline. It is unquestionably beautiful start to finish, but it's less than what Sarah could have made it.
B00008DDXC|3.0|It's a good movie but, once you own it you get tired of it. unless you're a harry potter fanatic or some sort of collecter I`d just rent it. Well if your shaking your head right now admit it. Once you know every word that comes out of harry`s mouth or memerized all the spells said dosnt it seem minutely boring to you? My advice is read the book over and over. That way you might improve your vocbulary. All an all-- BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!!
B00000K19E|5.0|I saw this scifi/action movie three times at cinema. When I first time was watching Matrix, I didn't understand a lot because I was so amazed about special effects. Second time I prepared to think and understanding result was much better. Third time I find more interesting details and realised that Matrix is one of the best action movies ever. Basic story goes like this. We are living in illusion world that which has made by someone. There is also another world where machines live. They have taken people for their slaves and are controlling us. We have to find a real saviour who can save for machines and forcoming human race destruction. The main character is Neo who will come to be a very important mission. First, He have to go to Matrix world where he can find Trinity and Morpheus who can help him for battle against to machines. You can find religious and philopsophius questions and thoughts in this film. Concentrate carefully and use your brain because this is not brainless action movie. This was the first movie that used a new rolling camera effect which came very popular for exemple Charlie's Angels has copied this camera effect. There is also a bad enemy called Mr. Smith which is very powerful, clever and nasty character!  This movie is must for every scifi/action movie friends and thinkin people!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I love Sarah, I was lucky enough to see her at all 3 Liliths, and I've been waiting anxiously for a new album from her. So it really hurts me that I can't give her a 5 (and it would really kill me if I can't give her a 4, so I won't).  Sarah's greatest asset is, of course, her ethereal voice; the voice of an angel.  I described it to a friend as the most beautiful voice this side of paradise; or, for that matter, the other side of paradise as well. Her voice is as beautiful as ever; it makes me ecstatic to listen to it.  What has set Sarah apart from other singer-songwriters, however, are her haunting melodies and heart-rending lyrics. And, with a couple of exceptions, they are missing in this album.  I'm a person who slips on a pair of headphones, shuts out the chaos around me, and listens to her words.  &quot;Fallen&quot; is a touching poem, especially the version that she's been playing on TV...just her and her piano, no band, just the way I like it.  This album is actually one continuous tone poem, with the different tracks as individual verses.  Note how the themes of &quot;falling&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, and &quot;answers&quot; run throughout the album.  But &quot;Fallen&quot;, unfortunately, is an exception in this album; no other song here is comparable; no other song &quot;grabs you.&quot;  Some of the arrangements are clever, waves swishing back and forth in &quot;Drifting&quot; and the rumbling of trains in &quot;Trainwreck&quot;.  But there are no songs like &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Drawn to the Rhythm&quot;, or &quot;Full of Grace&quot; (which defines the essence of music) that tears at your soul and sticks to you; songs that play over and over in your mind and makes you cry with emotion.  &quot;Push&quot;, in particular, has trite lines, &quot;You stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together&quot;; I expect more from her.  &quot;Answer&quot; is only OK as a song, but I love it because it truly highlights her voice. I am trying so hardto like this album. But that's the point; with her other albums, I didn't have to try.  This album evokes the atmosphere of an intimate nightclub; fantastic for me.  As I mentioned above, I like her best without her band...just her and her piano or her and her guitar. The style is reminiscent of an older generation...Julie London, for example.  The performance is great, but fleeting.  Unlike Sarah's other albums.<br />Also, as a side note, it's interesting that in yesterday's &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; [does her manager really have to subject her to such venues?], she sang &quot;Fallen&quot;, of course.  But for her second song she played &quot;Angel&quot; instead of another song from &quot;Afterglow.&quot;
6305311463|1.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I liked about the first 5 minutes, then I just remember wanting this retarded movie to end. It just kept going...and going....and going. It just got more absurd as the hours past. Terribal script, lame acting, dorky soundtrack. Especially that god awfull song by Areosmith. Sitting there in my seat after two and a half agonizing hours, I only could hope for a real asteroid to hit the earth to end this movie disaster. Do yourself a favor and buy a different dvd.
B00005JM02|5.0|FINDING NEMO is another victory for the Pixar Animation Studios and the Walt Disney Company. It is the 5th success in a row for the team, and that makes it a sad thing that Disney and Pixar are splitting their relationship with each other. I knew going in that it was going to be an amazing visual achievement--all of the previous Pixar films have been. What I didn't expect is for the film to make me laugh as hard as I did.<br />Writer/Director Andrew Stanton has crafted a story that is simple, but not dimwitted like so many other children's films. A clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) loses his wife and almost all of his children except one: Nemo. This traumatic loss makes Marlin very overprotective of Nemo, which is demonstrated when Nemo goes on a field trip with his class to \\"the drop\\". Marlin is horrified about this and even more horrified to witness Nemo venturing past the drop to try touching a boat fishing line on a dare. Nemo is captured by a diver and Marlin attempts to save him. He barely gets near the boat when the motor starts and the boat takes off. The diver's mask comes loose and ends up at the bottom of the ocean. <br />Marlin is determined to find his son no matter what it takes, and he soon finds himself paired up with a blue tang fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has short-term memory loss. This causes endless frustration for Marlin, but it soon turns out that he needs Dory's help. Even though she cannot remember things she is able to read writing on the mask's strap: an address in Sydney, Australia. The two of them find themselves in a situation that had me laughing uncontrollably: A Shark's Anonymous session. I liked the name of the Great White that is leading the meeting: Bruce. This session is a distraction for Marlin, but the session gets even funnier when the leader's instinct for blood takes over his better judgement and he attacks Marlin & Dory. They escape by using the place where the session is held: A drowned submarine with water-mines surrounding it. <br />While Marlin and Dory continue their search, Nemo finds himself stuck in a fish tank at a dentist's office in Sydney. All of the other fish are interesting and even funny. The leader is voiced by Willem Dafoe, playing a good guy for a change. But there is trouble happening. The dentist's daughter will be receiving one of the fish as a birthday present. The first time we see her in a photo, with braces and head-gear, I completely came apart laughing. Fish don't survive once they're in her hands, as the photo clearly shows. Later in the film when she appears at the door, I laughed again because of the music heard in the background. (If you see the movie you will agree it is the perfect music chosen.)<br />I'm probably giving away too much of the story. I mentioned that it is simple but not dimwitted. At the Pixar studio John Lasseter was heavily influenced by the style of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, who also avoids insulting an audience intelligence. From this movie Andrew Stanton must have learned from him as well. While he sets up situations for Marlin and Dory in their quest as well as with Nemo and the captured fish that actually had me on the edge of my seat, he finds some way to show me something I've never seen before. One thrilling sequence is when Marlin and Dory find themselves riding the East Austrailian Current (known as the EAC) on the shell of a sea turtle who talks like a hippie surfer dude. The current takes them on a clearly shown patten and at a high speed.I suspect that Disney will create a ride at Disneyland sometime in the future based on that. I would prefer to see it on a giant IMAX screen. <br />I mentioned two scenes that had me laughing uncontrollably. Another one comes late in the film. Nemo is free and searching for his dad when he finally meets Dory. She and Marlin have split up because he thinks Nemo has died. A crab knows where he went but refuses to tell where. She finds a perfect way to get him to talkby using a flock of seagulls up at the surface. It is this type of humor as well as the visual looks and intelligent storytelling that make FINDING NEMO such a wonderful family film.
0767814622|5.0|First, I couldn't BELIEVE what that guy said in his review. He said, just because it's based on a true story doesnt mean the prison's in Turkey are exactly like that. ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME MAN?? You obviously dont know jack about Turkish prison's. If anything was real and based on truth in this film, it was the brutality of Turkish police and the prisons. Do any of you people know what they do in Turkey, especially to women? There is a huge revolution going on as we speak. I cant even write down in my review what they do and have done to women, not just prisoners, to visitors, and to civilians. It's sick and brutal! Ok anyways, that was upsetting to hear that guy say that?Because he is wrong. This was a good movie. I'm glad it's one of the first movies to clearly show the world the brutality of the prisons in Turkey. I dont care what a person did to end up in the prison! They do not deserve to be tortured, raped, verbally abused, and driven to insanity. All Billy Hayes did was smuggle some hash for his friends back home. Yes it was highly stupid, but life? They tried to give him life? LIFE??Give me a break!! What about murder. That's not the same. Murder should be a life punishment. The law is so messed up in Turkey. The Turkish police think they can do whatever they want to people. They're evil, sadistic, twisted mothas. And when I say all, I mean it. If just one or two police officers were sick, and the rest were civilized rational good beings, dont u think the brutality would be stopped. And they all stick together. This film reminded me of Murder in the First, which was also a true story. This is a messed up world. I dont know if you people realize what prison alone can do to a person, but when you're also beaten, tortured, raped, and abused for years and years, a person can snap!! Just like William Hayes, and the guy from murder in the first. They were not bad people. They were driven to insanity and I was so glad, oh you have no idea, when Billy escaped at the end. That was his only way to survive, because like his girlfriend said, he was gonna die if he hadnt gotten out of that hell. I first heard of this movie when I watched the Cable Guy, when Jim Carrey did the oh billy scene. That was a good scene wasnt it, in midnight express! Hehe. It was very sad and dramatic. I give this movie 5 stars for the acting, the reality, and the drama. And remember, just because this film was made in the 70's, and about only one guy, it doesnt mean it didnt also happen to thousands of other people. He was just the one lucky enough to escape and tell his story, and have it documented to make a movie about it.... and he survived.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Well I ran out and saw it immediately and I was some what dissapointed. I can't give any spoilers because it just came out yesterday and I want to give others the opportunity to make up their own minds. If I had to do it over again I wouldn't pay regular price to see it NO.<br />What I didn't like was the same old rhetorical speeches, the monotone dialogue that gets on the nerves. The explanation of the entire series we expected to be wrapped up and make some sense to us but alas...I still walked out of their scratching my head (or perhaps slapping my forehead) thinking okay but what about...? A large majority of the movie takes place in Zion and therefore do not expect all the [fighting] scenes from previous installments. There are 3 good fightings sequences -- (1) with Morpheous, Trinity and the Oracle's protector (I think his name is Serapher??)(2) was Neo and the Dude who Smith infiltrated in Zion and (3) was Neo and Anderson in the Matrix. Other than those 3 scenes don't come looking for those [awesome fight] sequences that you come to love and expect from {{The Matrix}} I didn't like the long gaps without Neo and Trinity but I guess that is the way the story was supposed to go so that may not bother most movie watchers. There is plenty of \\"Mombo Jumbo\\" of words between all characters you know the....<br />person #1 \\"Why did I make this choice?\\"<br />person #2 \\"You know why you made this choice\\"<br />person #1 \\"Did you know why I made this choice\\"<br />person #2 \\"No, but I knew that you would choose what you needed at the time you had to make the choice\\"<br />URGH!!<br />What I did like, well I always like the relationship between Trinity and Neo this movie does justice to that and then some... I'm happy that they didn't push that to the way side, althought I think at the core of this movie is how much Neo needed Trinity and how far she was willing to go for him. I liked watching Zion defend itself that was pretty cool, I liked the special effects (although at times I got quite dizzy... you'll understand when you see the movie)I liked (some what) the way it ended our Hero is our Hero and LOVE goes on. Unfortunately that is all I can say without giving to much away.<br />Respectfully Revieweds I got quite dizzy... you'll understand when you see the movie)I liked (some what) the way it ended our Hero is our Hero and LOVE goes on.

B00008NRI8|3.0|Sandra Bullock plays the modern day hippie-lawyer-do-gooder who ends up working for the styrafoam plate loving corporate kabillionaire, hugh Grant, in hopes of making a difference. When time goes by and Bullock realizes she has become Grant's personal wardrobe cooridinator and has not done very much good for the world at all, she gives in her two weeks notice, which causes both to realize how much they really do care about each other.<BR> This isn't one of Sandra Bullock's worst attempts *Cough* Murder by Numbers, speed 2, Two if by Sea.... But it certainley isn't the  best - Ms. Congeniality, Practical Magic.... The chemistry between her &amp; Hugh Grant is really all that makes the movie watcjable. The writing is on the dull side and the plot is rather predictable. But, Sandra Bullock still remains the queen of cuteness. Worth watching once - who knows, you might actually want to watch it again.
B00008H2LB|4.0|It is really hard to find a band these days that tries to continue a saga of really well put together music. Linkin Park has created another album, that sounds similar to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, but is a completely different album altogether. The same sound has worked for many bands over the years. AC/DC hasn't changed much in 2 decades, and still continue to sell new releases in high volumes. <BR>&quot;Meteora&quot; is a compilation of well thought out projects that meld together hip hop, metal, electronica, and screaming vocals, same to the last album. Each song is unique, and has many different sounds within themselves. I didn't find anything on this album that came close to the hit &quot;In The End&quot;, but I did appreciate the efforts on songs like &quot;Don't Say&quot; and &quot;Faint&quot;, with beats and intrumentals that really motivate you to go do...something. <BR>I think the majority of this album is for the fans who appreciate the sound of Linkin Park. It sounds great, just like &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. I liked the fact that Linkin Park has decided to stay the same, and not drift off too much to be in the same boat with bands like Metallica, or Limp Bizkit who are fighting to find a new style to keep up with the new bands. Too much change might have brought them down, but the same/new sound on this album makes them a front runner for the &quot;nu&quot;metal industry.
B00005JM1F|4.0|The story is about three guys in their thirties who decide to start their own fraternity. They say that it's to save Luke Wilson's character from losing his house, but really it's just an excuse for them to party, get drunk, and have lots of fun again. I had very low expectations for this movie because I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrel - he's never really made me laugh that much before... But this movie shocked me at how funny it really is. Don't expect to be watching an Oscar contender; but it's not meant to be one. It's meant to be stupid and silly and funny - and it is. watch it! you'll laugh!
B000001FN3|4.0|I first heard this album at a friend's pad in 1976, while \\"under the influence\\" (as we often were), and immediately bought a copy of the LP for myself.  Although \\"I Robot\\" and \\"Pyramid\\" were also great albums, I must confess to having burned out on Alan Parsons after that (his music, to me, became almost a parody of itself-- too much of the same formula time and again).  But this was, and is, his masterpiece.  Even if you aren't into so-called \\"prog-rock\\", I defy you to listen to this album (especially in a darkened room, and perhaps, though not necessarily, in the before-mentioned \\"altered state\\") without becoming completely absorbed in it.  From the very first moments through the final fade, listening to this album is like taking a journey into another reality (much like the early Moody Blues albums) and when it ends, macabre as it's been, you aren't really sure whether or not you're quite ready to return to the reality that surrounds you.  Like everything Alan Parsons had a hand in (remember Floyd's Dark Side?), the production values are incredible, especially for the time.  In addition, the packaging on the original LP was gorgeous.  My only complaint with the CD version is that, for whatever reason, Parsons felt that what was already a masterpiece somehow needed to be \\"improved\\" upon.  Although adding the brief spoken passages by Orson Welles does indeed enhance the original, the remixing, especially on the drums, was totally unneccesary.  Instead of an improvement, I find it a heavy-handed annoyance, particularly on the gorgeous album closer, \\"To One In Paradise\\".  This album just did not need to be tampered with.  I haven't heard the MFSL Gold Disc version, but I understand that it contains the original version.  If you can find one, it would definitely be worth seeking out.  Otherwise, try to find the original LP-- it's worth it anyway, just for the sleeve.  In the meantime, I would still recommend buying this reissue.  If it's all you can get, it's still much better than never having heard this beautiful album at all.    UPDATE, Nov. 2007:  There is now a special deluxe edition of this album available which combines this 1987 remix with the original 1976 version in a 2-disc set.  The packaging and sound quality are excellent, and though pricey, it's a better value for the money spent because you now have a choice of listening to either version.  I believe that, having heard both, you'll also prefer the original.  Or maybe not.  But the new edition at least gives you the choice...!
0425188809|5.0|Wow. Its hard to put into words how incredible this book is. I would recommend this book to anyone. It has suspense, love, laughter, sadness. It made me laugh, it made me cry. Its a wonderful plot with colorful characters and an enthralling climax. Just when you are sure the worst has happened, Koontz surprises you again. I must say this is the best book I have ever read and will always compare his books to this one. I especially enjoyed reading his afterword. It is true, this is Koontz's finest hour.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|At first listen I couldn't even pay attention to see if the songs were any good. From what I understand this is the same producer that did their first record. But you'd never know it from the wierd sounds comin' outta this thing. The drums sound is very strange. When I first heard it I thought it was a picollo snare with even less low end. Or perhaps a drum machine. But when I listened again, I saw that it was possibly a failed attempt at recreating the STAX drum sound. But like many who try, they got it all wrong. And the vocals.... allthough the singing is perhaps more on key and together than on the first album, you can't hear them! The vocals are completely buried in the mix. Completely different than the up front crazy vocal sound of &quot;this is it&quot;. With that said... some of the songs are starting to grow on me. And the strokes style is still there, if ya dig it. So I reckon you'd just need to judge for yourself.
B00003CWL6|5.0|It took me a while to right htis because my parents had heard bad things about it, and they forbid me from seeing it, but now I have and I can't believe it took me so long. This has to be one of the cleverest movies for quite some time. I loved it the first time I had watched it and every time I watch it it gets more and more interesting. It could be a timeless classic. And the fact that it is so origional is a plus...<br />Lester Burnam is in his 40s and has given up on life completely. He knows his wife and daughter hate him, and his job is threatened. His wife is a real estate sales woman, and one night, Lester and Carolyn attend a sort of, reception. And there, Carolyn becomes attrawcted to her competition, and Lester sneaks out and \\"parties\\" with his teenage neighbor Ricky Fittz, who has been video-taping his daughter. So Lester and Ricky become friends as Lester occasionlay checks up to get more drugs from him. And one night, at a baskeball game, Lester meets Janes best friend, Anglea, who he then finds a purpose to exist in, and she spends the night and Lester is hooked at he has wild fantasies abou ther and rose petals. So the story leads up to the conclusion where Ricky's dad, who is an ex marine core man, spys on his son and BELIEVES he is giving Lester a blow job and he wont let his son turn into a homosexual ( cleaning up the language a bit ) and tells him to get out. Mean while, Lester finds his wife chesting on him with Buddy and he doesn't really care, their marriage is for show, to show how perfect they really are, when they are any thing but, and Anglea and Jane have a fight because Angela wants to sleep with Lester, and he gets just that, almost, but, Anglea tells him that she is a virgin, and so the story goes....<br />The end, when Lester is talking about his life, that actually brought me to tears ( I swear to you ) and I thought it was so moving. I look back now and I still think it is extremely well written and filmed. My dad said that this resembles MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, except with no comedy. This has to be one of the top movies of the decade. People have their own oppinions, and say this movie sucked, and I will not argue, I only ask you do as the motto says, and look closer because a movie as beautiful as this deserves more than one look.....
B00008EY9G|3.0|I have heard a lot about this movie and its surprise ending.  But unlike The Sixth Sense, this move does not have a surprise ending.  All you have to do is pay attention and you will see al of the blatant clues telling you what will happen.<br />The viewer thinks they know what is going on as a collection of characters find themselves stuck at a small motel in a dreadful downpour.  Other scenes concern a mass-murderer who is getting a last-minute hearing.  The prisoner is en-route to the hearing.  But by paying attention we know that what the film wants us to think is far from true.<br />In Agatha Christie fashion, the people in the motel begin to be murdered.  Tensions and suspicions mount.  A new arrival at the hearing substantiates the earlier clues and derails the average viewer's ideas of what is going on.<br />Finally we get to the end where we resolve the relationship between the characters, the motel, the hearing and just what is going on.  No real surprise thanks to the blatant clues.  But even that hinges on believing a &quot;new treatment&quot; is possible without any explanation as to how it was done especially when it is the impossibility of said treatment that causes the dysfunction in the first place.  (sorry for being vague but there are those who will still be surprised and I don't want to spoil it).<br />The disk contains three versions: full screen, wide-screen, and extended wide-screen (extended by only a few minutes).  There are also some interesting deleted scenes (they are included in the novelization), but nothing mind-blowing.<br />A decent movie with great atmosphere (you'll never look at rain the same way) and some interesting characters.  But it could have been better if they didn't put in all of those clues.
630521610X|5.0|Slasher horror had almost disappeared fromthe face of earth, until in the corner of Wes Cravens mind, he got an idea, a brillant one, one that would bring back horror and keep in the nightmares of everyone in the world....This was one of the best slasher films I had ever seen. I saw it with friends when it came out and I knew it was going to be an amazing movie with great sequels. The plot is just so origional, and it makes perfect sense and it's hard for anyone not to like it.<br />Sydney Prescott is in highschool, with a boyfriend, friends, and a good dad, but things go wrong when her class mates turn up slaughtered. Soon, Sydney finds herself in the middle of a brutal killer, who turns out to be the one person closest to her, her boyfriend and his best friend. They blame Sydneys mother for sleeping with his father, and breaking up the family. And now Billy wants revenge. <br />This moive has so many twists and turns and scares, it has to be one of the best slasher flicks out there. When you bring up the topic of slasher movies, Scream will undoubtidly be in that disscusion sooner or later. Wes Craven did a great job and produced 2 more good sequals, to make one of the most populare trilogys ever.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I was really reluctant to see this movie, but now I've become a fan of Tarantino. Flying limbs aside (pardon), this movie is a true work of art; the movie's overall direction is phenomenal (of course it's Tarantino!), not to mention the choice of music is near perfect.  Most of the songs on this CD are eerily mesmerizing especially the ones by Nancy Sinatra and Meiko Kaji (you might get goosebumps occasionally, but that is part of the thrill).  And you'll find that you'll be playing this CD in your car, at your home stereo, and on your computer.  Need I say more?
B00005NRO3|4.0|Wes Craven hits it big again with this amazing sequal! NO one was really expecting this to be better than the origional, ( most sequals SUCK ) but this was a much anticipated movie and hit hard hwen it came out. This very closely came to surpassing the origional. <br />Sydney still believes that there is a killer waiting to get her, and she's right, with a movie about her life coming out, more muders start to occur. And she soon again finds herself in the middle of vicious murders. And she finds out that it is again a tag team duo, Micky, the freaky film student, and Billy's mother, who also, like her son, seeks good old fashion revenge....<br />What made this movie so populare was that it took Scream to a new level, bringing in other stars, and having movies inside a movie, and it mixed comedy with horror. Tastefuly, in one of hte first secens, we meet a college class discussing how sequals suck. This all thrown into one makes for a fun movie that is packed with it's share of thrills.
B0000029LG|5.0|It does not matter if you like Michael Jackson away from his music or not.  The fact remains that he was king of pop in the 80's, broke sales records and pioneered a lot of what artists do today such as choreographed dancing in rock videos.  This double CD collection contains most of his greatest work.  Some classics such as Smooth Criminal are missing however.  The classics from the Thriller, Bad, Dangerous and other albums such as, Billie Jean, Thriller, Beat It, Man in the Mirror, Bad , Black or White are here along with a number of others which should satisfy any music fan.  Hardcore MJ fans would offcourse already own each individual album but this album is great for non huge fans such as myself who just want the classics.  There are thirty songs on this album so it is pretty good value for money.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Matrix I was a triumph of the marriage between a Hong Kong style kungfu fu flick and the typical Hollywood blockbuster. It had jaw-dropping action sequences and CGI effects that blew everybody away and set the standard for future CGI-infused thrillers. What made it so memorable was that it had a story, a plot and a concept all neatly rolled into one. It was so engaging that by the time the credits were rolling, you almost wanted to cry of relief that you're still in the real world and at the same time pray that the Matrix doesn't really exist.<br />Fast forward to November 2003 and here we are at the screening of the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy. After the debacle that was Matrix Reloaded, expectations are high as the W brothers try to redeem themselves with a bang of an ending. To be fair, M3 is better than M2. Much better. The CGIs are still quite breathtaking albeit less explosive, and there is actually a semblance of a plot this time round. Gone is the technobabble that threatened to sink M2. In its place is simple logic and heart which leads us to an inevitable showdown between Neo and Smith(s).<br />Sadly, there is minimal character development and the lead actors are pretty much left to their own devices to try and spice things up with whatever dismal lines that they are given. In fact Neo and gang actually disappear halfway through the show leaving only the CGI sentinels to salvage whatever dignity this trilogy had. As a result, nothing of importance really happens until the final half hour of the movie and by then you would've stopped caring for whomever it was that survived the invasion. <br />Finally, the way they wrapped it up is inconclusive, messy and totally not worth all the trouble the original writers took to create an alternative reality and fate. Which begets the question: How did something which started out so well end up so bad?
B000066AXC|4.0|for those who want to see Crowe really lay the smack down as a skitzo man who sees invisible people and does an amazing job, well then this one is for you. with strong moments and a good cast including Ed Harris, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Adam Goldbgerg, Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettamy. not the best film od 2001 one but its a good movie.
B00005JMFR|5.0|These five stars are not \\"just because I liked it\\" stars.  They are \\"the movie was a story that will be told for years to come\\" stars.<br />Hugo Weaving deserves an oscar.  ...., you felt his anger in this movie, with every word that came out of his mouth.  People say that Keanu Reeves can't act, but I think his acting has gotten better through the years, and that his reputation should just leave him already.  Great job on his part.  Carrie Ann Moss: outstanding.  Laurence Fishkburne: fantastic, even though in this installment, he didn't get much screen time. And last but not least: Jada Pinkett, OMG, she can act her little ... off.  Her screen presence was commanding.<br />Ok, now on to my review, but before that, here's my take on some of the fans.  This is more than a movie, it is a story about the Human Condition;  lets not forget that.  Psuedo-fans are looking for fight scenes every 5 minutes to hold their attention.  They get uncomfortable when they see people expressing love, and expressing other aspects of human emotion (pain, guilt, anger and sorrow).  This is the guts of it all people! This is the bowels of the movie.  We have seen what it is all about.  It's not only about being free from machines. No, it's about why we want to be free, and what we are willing to do to get free, and the sacrifices of that freedom, and why we sacrifice: our ability to love. I disagree with what someone said in the movie. It's not just a word. It's what's makes us human.<br />Great Visuals!  I was in awe for a good part of the movie.  This movie is intricate.  It's not a onetime watcher movie, where you watch it once and understand it all.  But you will soon enough. You will understand that the Watchowski brothers did a great job at telling this story.  My hat off to them.  I don't think they can do it again, even if they wanted to.  It's like this story has eclisped all others, and anything else will seem mediocre.
6304973187|3.0|a good version of the classic tradegy of Shakespeares work. Leo and Claire are cool as the two love birds who fall in love for one another. John Leguizamo snaps and sparks as Tybalt and Harold Perrineau Jr is simply wonderful as Mercutio, but did he have to do drag. some down falls along the way but it picks up with its grand acting. others will note that Jamie Kennedy, Paul Rudd, Diane Venora, Paul sorvino, Brian Dennehy, Dash Mihok, Christian Pickles and Miriam Margoyles also star as well. directed by Baz Luhrman(Moulin Rouge and Strictly Ballroom)
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah returns to us after her hiatus and is as good as ever.  Four star album deserving of the fifth for such a strong offering after the lengthy abscence.  <br />  Her mellifluous voice and sophisticated orchestration is consistently worth purchasing her albums.  Afterglow contains the most mature and craftful lyrics of any Sarah album yet.  The travails of her life are reflected throughout the album, particularly the maturity of lyrics.<BR>  <BR>  Highlights to note: <BR>'Fallen' is very good as the lead single. <br />'Answer'- they lyrics read like a poem, phenomenal song. <br />'Dirty Little Secret'- a haunting piece- song allows 'Afterglow' to fade out - maybe the best on the album.
B00000JPHG|1.0|a killer doll is frightening, well it is if it were real but these movies suck, I mean the first one was the best but making one after another after another is sorta tiresome and mind numbing and you wish you could just stop these stupid horror franchises their coming out with lastely. purely for the fans of the Chuckster but my god, the story is so lame, him making himself a bride and Jennifer Tilly turns into a frickin doll. though the funniest thing would have to be when that stoner sees a moving and talking doll. otherwises beware the smelly cheese of the movie
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Ever since I got this CD months back I dont seem to want to play anything else.  Im addicted to Gavin and his voice.  I just had a baby and this the songs in &quot;Chariot&quot; are his lullabies.  All I can say to someone who is considering buying this CD is:  Do it you will not regret it!  I am dying to see him live!  This is without a doubt one of my favorite CDs EVER!!!
078062582X|1.0|this is really a horrible movie. no good story meets a cast that is wasted permenetly. man what a crock of spit man. I'm sorry for all you Striptease fans but this one I did not like and I dont care if Demi Moore is nude or not, its so awful, this and Showgirls. I cant believe this was ever concieved man. I was bored all threw out and Burt Reynolds is not funny at all. Ving Rhames, Armand Assante and Robert Patrick are wasted as well
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Ever since I purchased this CD I can't play anything else, is so good Im addicted to it.  I bought it when I was pregnant and now that I've had my baby is what I sing to him.  We love it!  Gavin is so talented!  My advice to anyone who is considering getting this CD is, DO IT, you won't regret it!
6302256615|4.0|Keanu(Neo) is a undercover cop who investigates a robbery done by people who dress up in ex-president masks and the clues follow to the man he gets close to, a surfing frizzy haired Patrick Swayze. Point Break breaks into good action with some great surfing and a tubular cast man. Neo knows how to surf those waves. the wave at the end is monstrous. for diehard Reeves and Swayze buffs
B00005NVT1|4.0|Absolutly sexy electronic music...let me say first the only  reason why I gave it four instead of five stars is because I know I will still listen to \\"Homework\\" more .......If you own \\"Homework\\",buy this Immediatly!,if you don't...RUN AND BUY HOMEWORK!!!!...you have no idea what you're missing.......the only other con i can possibly add is  the crowd needs to tune it down a bit during one of the serious parts of the set......but it's really nothing..<BR>... ......if the scale was a 1-10,I'd give it a 9.8,not the 8 that this system limits anything short of perfect to....<br />..For those that know Daft Punk,there's nothing to say.....for those that don't....their eclectic sound is reflectsive of the inovators of electronic music,much less house.......this album I think is a modern symphony.....a huge range of sounds and moods.The fact that it's in a one track form is beautiful....you should'nt listen to one part of a symphony if you want to really feel  the entire piece....no?...<br />.They completely flipped the \\"Homework\\" album and turned out a near perfect example of the versitility of their work and talents.....I have been waiting to see a live show of theirs for years and this is the closest I've come.....that is a complaint to them and a complement to this album.<br />Buy it,punks.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus evolves unlike a lot of bands. This is shown in comparison between Make Yourself and Morning View. I can listen to their songs all day every day. Also, go see Incubus perform live. You'll love it, they morph their songs to the best which leaves me addicted to them.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Such as, the fact that Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor were marvelous actors, and the plot kept you enthralled from step one. The singing was absolutely gorgeous, and the costumes were beautiful. Now, the problems I have with the movies are simple.<br />1. Without a large screen, the beautiful, slightly dizzying scenes have lost their full impact.<br />2. You can only watch this movie so many times without it getting on your nerves.<br />I'm looking at this objectively, mind you. I spent a greater part of the year loving everything about this movie. I saw it three times in theatres.<br />But when I got it home, it just wasn't the same.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn at his very best. No one could pull off these kinds of swashbucklers better than Flynn(though this is much more than just that). What a great movie for everyone at anytime. You just can't get tired of it. And that great Technicolor! Wow! Not to be missed over and over again. . .My 9 year old daughter just saw it for the first time and loved every minute. The extras are excellent as well.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This album kills.  I think its an improvement over New American Gospel, which is saying a lot.  I first heard LOG on the Danny Way DC commercial and from that 15 second snippet I had to track these guys down.  The song Pariah from New American Gospel is used in that commerical, but I couldn't find a copy of New American Gospel so I picked up As The Palaces Burn.  OMFG, I was dropped to the floor.  This album is killer.  I'd consider it death metal, but its actually good :-)  I like some death metal but only when there's some real song structure and not just blast beat wanking.  If you like heavy, and I do mean heavy, metal, pick up this album you will not be disappointed.
0345457684|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, with its convoluted plot and gritty, involving hard SF ideas. Sure, there are failings, logical and technical, but the sheer power of the the style over the substance in this tale glossed them over. Although it is cobbled together from all kinds of other sources, movies (Blade Runner,Bond, John Woo, Takeshi Kitano) &amp; books (well noted in the other reviews), the synergistic mix certainly had a life of its own, and there was no shortage of clear visuals and a sense of place in most scenes. The setting 400 years in the future seemed a little too far away for the level of technology and culture, maybe it should have been 200 to 250 years. Although I understand this novel has been optioned for film, I am wondering how you make a movie about a hero whose real face is hardly seen and who occupies 4 bodies in the course of the story, two of which head off to simultaneous but separate adventures... (Face-Off?) Maybe the next installment will fill in some of the missing info other reviewers have remarked on.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is definately an album that speaks to the fans.  I haven't had the chance to dig into all the tracks entirely (as they deserve) but I've gone through the album, in it's entirety, at least 5-6 times now.  Her lyrics and sound are back to the Sarah that I adore.  Maybe it's just me, but I think Fallen really explains why she's so special, just barely surviving in this commerical world.  Fallen = her career during Surfacing?  I still love Surfacing, but Afterglow is more like Solace and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy (easily my favorites).  For me, Fallen gives warning to artists that they will be tempted.  Although, I think she proves that she can come back.  A step backward... in the RIGHT direction.  :)  Awesome to have you back Sarah.
B00005JM02|5.0|having never seeing &quot;nemo&quot; in it's theatrical engagement, i was so totally delighted and mesmerized by the astounding animation, the excellent sound, some really great acting (voice overs) by albert brooks and ellen d. i could not move away from it for a single moment! pixar is to be highly praised for such gorgeous animation, resplendant colors, they really deserve an oscar for this one! i have no children, so this was for both my wife and i to enjoy--boy, did we! run, however, don't walk, to buy this 2 set dvd! the lines on tuesday were incredible but ever so worth it! this one's a real keeper to savor over and over again.  bravo to pixar and disney studios for a magnificent job, and an unforgettable 2 dvd set.
0441003257|4.0|From the two masters of the fantasy genre comes a hilarious tale of the apocalypse, as caused by a little boy. The story follows a demon called Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale as they seek Adam, the son of the antichrist that who was accidentally switched with another boy at birth. Now, Adam is being raised by in an average middle-class home, and is one of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet, according to his parents anyway.<BR>From the Satanic order of chattering nuns, to the death-by-holy water, this book will have you rolling on the floor and turning its pages for a long time to come. A great read.
B00005JKC3|3.0|That said though, I TOTALLY understand where people are coming from when they say they didn't enjoy it.<br />Universal really fumbled the ball when they tried to advertise 'Hulk' as a front -to-back action movie.  It just isn't, I can't put it any more simply then that.  If that's what you are expecting (or had expected) I can almost guarantee you'd come away disappointed.<br />Ang Lee is an art-house director ('Ice Storm' 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and that influence very clearly shows here.  'Hulk' is much more a character study of Bruce Banner then it is an action movie.  The Hulk as a comic book character was always, quietly, one of the more complex characters in the Marvel universe, as opposed to the rampaging maniac that most people unfamiliar with the comic seem to think he is.  Lee's choice to explore the former when most people were actually expecting the latter wound up alienating a great deal of the target audience.  <br />That's really a shame too because it's really a terrific movie.  The story and plot were really well thought out.  The changes that were made to the Hulk's origin made a lot of sense.  The performances were all great (Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot really stole the movie).  It's just too bad that so many people were (I feel) misled to expect something that they, ultimately, weren't going to get.
B00005JM0B|5.0|(...)<br />This movie was without a doubt the best film of the summer. It has a lot of comic relief which was absolutely nessessary, or else this movie would have been most likely the darkest ever to exist. It's not a happy movie, and trust me, T2 seems like a teletubbies movie compared to this one. For everyone who ever wanted the bad guys to win, this is your movie. For everyone who truly wanted Cameron's story to live on, it couldn't have been done better. For everyone who wished they could see more of the war, you will, not in this installment though. For everyone who thought the ending messed up the plot of the 1st 2, read on.<br />James Cameron is a perfectionist. In a way, he set the series up for a 3rd. In the end of T2, the rest of model 101's arm was still in the factory, from what I'm aware of, that's what the novels continued from. You all think that the ending killed everything that was done in the past. Think about this now...think hard. Having Judgement Day happen only verified the last 2 movies. If Judgement Day never happened, then neither would anything in Terminator or T2. I read the prologue to one of the books and it was skynet talking, and it said something to this effect, \\"There's many different timelines that exist now, the original, the one when the first terminator was sent, when the T-1000 was sent, and so on. At some point, they'll all make one timeline, although, 2 things have always remained. The existance of John Connor, and me.\\" I read a review that someone wrote about how you really can't think about things that deep in this series, and they're right. If you think about it, the entire storyline is pointless. <br />Stop thinking too hard, watch the movie again, and you'll agree. After waiting 12 years, this was worth it.
0375432302|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. However, I do feel it got too much hype and is slightly over rated. I read Angels and Demons first, and I loved it. I found the DaVinci Code to be too similar to Angels and Demons. It was almost the same....only they changed the characters names around. I would recommend Angels and Demons over the DaVinici Code. I felt that The DaVinci Code dragged ona bit and was not as gripping and intriguing as Angels and Demons!!!
B00005JMFR|5.0|I've seen the movie, and I think it's the best Sci-Fi movie that's been done recently. The timing, the pace is perfect, you can feel the tension in the theater. Whatever you like, is there.<br />Anime, Mechas, Superheroes, Videogames, Cyberpunk, Hard Sci-Fi, religious symbology and philosophical systems. And everything is well orchestrated in a not so long movie, with an excellent musical score. <br />I personally think \\"Reloaded/Animatrix\\" was just the biggest teaser in movie history, \\"Revolutions\\" is the real movie.<br />There will definitely be controversy. Some questions are not clearly answered, but it is trully consistent as a whole.<br />This movie is a must. The Matrix Has You...
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I am rather new to Sarah, having become a fan over the summer after hearing the AMAZING song &quot;Fear,&quot; and I am very pleased with this album. It's haunting and beautiful. Sarah is a wonderful songwriter whose music will bring tears to your eyes. Too bad the album has only ten songs! &quot;Fallen&quot; and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; are my favorites; buy &quot;Afterglow&quot; for those songs alone. A nice addition to any music collection.

B0000062GK|5.0|Joe Satriani is one of the greatest guitarists of all time!!!<BR>I love this cd, I am so glad I bought it.  I have already recommended it to a bunch of people.

This cd is captivating from the first song to the last.<BR>I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is the ultimate comedy for bored, middle class, gen Xers (the kind of folk who frequent amazon.com for example...).  Guilty as charged - I love it!  While office comedies in the past typically revolved around the protagonist trying desperately not to lose their job (The Apartment springs to mind...), the everyman in this movie refreshingly doesn't care.  I think this touches a nerve in the heart of everyone who watches it knowing that their life does, or someday will, revolve around a clock, a computer and socializing with a group of people you would otherwise avoid like the plague...<br />Mike Judge creates a fantastic bunch of characters, largely unsympathetic and weaves a plot around them that, while reminiscent of Superman 3, ends up playing second fiddle to the sharp dialogue, the set-piece sketches and the ironic, but perfectly captured interpersonal relationships that will resonate so intensely with the right viewer.<br />The only people I've ever heard of who didn't like this film were a bunch of management consultants from London who didn't find it at all funny... It's too close to home and it's too near the bone...<br />It's also amusing to see how &quot;Office Space&quot; has crept into the cultural vernacular - pick up any issue of FHM, Maxim and the like and you'll find plenty of sly references to TPS reports, staplers and &quot;Ummm....Yeah...What's Happening?&quot;.<br />You owe it to yourself to watch this movie!
B00005YU1O|5.0|waking life, how shall i start.this film was a work of art, one of the best films i have ever seen in my life the whole film with its charactors alway going into these crazy very indepth rants and in to a train of thought that i can only get with the use of mushrooms. so i feel this was a amazeing film and every one that can even think should watch it and watch it more then once so it sinks in.<BR>                     andy .w

B00006GFAB|1.0|I was a big Kiss fan as a teenager and had the ALIVE in vinyl.  With the title, &quot;BEST&quot; I was expecting some of the golden oldies and instead was tortured with some very poor studio recordings that sounded so mechanical I had to take the CD out of the player after a few songs and almost gave it a fling!  There is no passion in this music at all and it sounds like a bunch of robot musicians going through the songbook.    Very poor. There might be some better tracks later on but I couldn't take the punishment to get there.   Very dissapointed!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Soundgarden is an awesome band and Chris Cornell an amazing vocalist. I have always hated Rage Against the Machine. Though I guess I could symphathise with some of their lyrics, de la Rocha sucks! The band was always awesome. Every song I heard by them sounded good, and then his really really annoying rap voice comes in and ruins it. Now that they have a great singer, the band is pretty much perfect. The boys of Rage and Cornell blend perfectly. Tom can do some really wierd stuff on his guitar, Chris can still wail, and the drumming along with the bass sound just solid. This album is just amazing. And the best thing is, they sound totally different from all the other new crap out there. Songs like Cochise, Show Me How to Live, Gasoline, and Set It Off, are just kick a** rockers. Then they have softer songs such as Like a Stone and I Am the Highway are softer and slower, but they sound really good. No stupid lyrics, no rip-offs of other bands. Just a high quality rock album. And after being together for longer, I beleieve they're only to get better and better. I am so ready for their next album. But until then I HIGHLY recommend this album to fans of both Rage and Soundgardn, and especially anyone just looking for a great rock album.
B00005JLT5|1.0|I know I am on dangerous grounds here.  With the near certainty of being labeled anti-Semite, I have to say that, of the array of Holocaust movies which have come out over the years, if you've seen one of them, you seen them all, almost.  Dignified human drama depicting the human spirit triumphing over hardships.  You have already seen a dozen of these.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix has me! I have followed this trilogy since it's start and I have completely understood the meanings behind this movie. To follow it correctly you need to have seen every aspect of the story in the Animatrix, The Matrix, Reloaded, Enter the Matrix(Game), Revolutions. What a finish! The story is extremely deep and the action is awesome. This final movie left me feeling fulfilled and amazed. This story is about love, trust and belief in the greater good. This has been the best ride of my life since Star Wars! ***** Five Stars!
B0000C16OQ|5.0|The problem with releasing a remastered version of the 1978 hit soundtrack, &quot;Grease&quot; is that in one shape or another most avid music listeners probably have the soundtrack. Myself I have gone through three incantations of the soundtrack: from double vinyl record to cassette tape and then single CD. Unlike these previous releases, the new remastered edition of the &quot;Grease&quot; soundtrack features an extra disc with unreleased songs on it as well as duplicating the original vinyl record sleeves. In comparing the double CD remastered edition with the single CD release, one can truly hear the difference in sound quality. The single CD release, although passable, sounds somewhat flat and the singer's voice sounds like it is in the background rather than the foreground of the music. The remastered edition is a bit more pricy than the Polydor single CD, but worthe every penny to a die hard &quot;Grease&quot; fan who wants to hear these timeless tunes as they have never been heard before.
0792839129|5.0|i was born in 1988, years after the film came out but it was on tv once and we taped it, i watched it nearly everyday, now at 15 whenever i am bored or sick i watch it. I know every word every song the whole thing. This is a movie staring Dick Van Dyk, and is about a inventor named caractacus pots. He fixes up a old motor carr and they name it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. A King finds out about it and wants to steal it. I say you just have to buy the movie and watch it for yourself its an remarkably unforgettable experiance. There is also so many songs, i love P.O.S.H posh. chitty chitty bang bang of course. Tot sweet. there is one bad point about this film and that is the love song, i fastforward that part as it is too slow and lovey dovey. I LOVE THIS FILM. well im off to watch it bye
B000089RVR|5.0|I LOVED No Angel and when I first heard Life for Rent, Dido's second effort didn't seem to come close. Then, I listened to the CD a 2nd and 3rd time. I found myself totally hooked. Dido's lyrics are meaningful on multi-levels, her voice is addictive, and the music is something I find myself humming all of the time. I love this CD--even more than I loved No Angel.
B00005JMFR|1.0|This was such a boring movie.  Can't they come up with something new.  Matrix 4 is going to be another dumb movie.  i think they are going to make enough Matrix's that people are going to get sick of it.  I am sick of it already.  They should of stopped at one.  Nothing the first matrix.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is incredible, from start to finish.  The album is laced with a theme about fire and light which is rarely seen in other rock cd's as of late(the theme not the light &amp; fire).  Each song makes you want to turn the volume up and take in all the words and music like a fireball.   The cd opens with Cochise which is a heavy vocal and guitar driven song that has the power to get you out of your seat and moving.  I have also seen this band live in NY and they are even more remarkable live that I hope they release a live cd.  You should definetly pick up this cd beacuse it is what rock use to be, no filler, just the meat.
B000002MG1|5.0|This was unsurprisingly my first R.E.M. album. It wasn't on purpose, though: I was in a very small music store &amp; this was the only R.E.M. album they had. It's fitting nevertheless, since half of the album is comprised of singles, &amp; besides I got the chance to listen to the album before buying it so it's not a case of discovering a new &amp; exciting band but rather an affirmation. This is exactly why it's so hard to review this album without repeating other reviews: This thing has the word &quot;classic&quot; written all over it. But then again, its ever-growing popularity only comes to emphasise the strength of the non-single half of the album. Automatic For The People is mostly linked with the comforting radio song that is &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, &amp; it's impossible to hear the song without playing its brightly lit Jake Scott video in your head; But few people notice the darker images which open the song that comes two tracks later, &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;: <br />&quot;Readying to bury your father and your mother,<BR>what did you think when you lost another?<BR>I used to wonder why did you bother,<BR>distanced from one, blind to the other?&quot;<br />I always noticed how our parents mean less &amp; less to us as we grow up, &amp; this song is the only one I know of which elicits this cruel, albeit natural, way of the world. Despite that, the song's chorus is a simple descent from a major to minor chord, with the short line including the deceptively non sequitur title: &quot;Oh, oh, but sweetness follows&quot;. It's a perfect example for a representative R.E.M./album song that stands for everything they both represent, yet remains unknown to non-fans who don't have the album &amp; printed the lyrics off of the Internet. Similarly, &quot;Monty Got A Raw Deal&quot; is an upbeat R.E.M. song of the same calibre as &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;, &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; &amp; &quot;Imitation Of Life&quot;. Peter Buck hones his ability to write &amp; play a simple, classic arpeggio which soon reveals itself to be another catchy-uplifting-chord-pattern-R.E.M.-formula, complete with Michael Stipe's esoteric references which enrich the song &amp; prevent it from being a disposable hit. In fact, &quot;Monty Got A Raw Deal&quot; is one of the most memorable songs on the album, &amp; one of the songs I was most looking forward to listen to after buying the album, if not the most. The only reason why this song isn't a classic like the other aforementioned four songs is that- you guessed it- it wasn't a single.<br />Despite all of that, though, I was looking forward to hear the singles as well, no matter how familiar I was with them. As mentioned before, &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; is a timeless jump-around-the-room-&amp;-sing-along R.E.M. single; whilst &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; will forever remain a favourite shower song, as I amuse myself with the thought that most people still don't understand the chorus (it's &quot;Call me when you try to wake her up&quot;/&quot;I can always sleep standing up&quot;). &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, on the other hand, is by now far removed from mere single material status, being the only song to take on that subject &amp; forever link it to nostalgia &amp; fantasies of a peaceful, idyllic, suburban American life. To put it more bluntly, you can't think of nightswimming without thinking of &quot;Nightswimming&quot;.<br />The one thing all of the songs have in common, regardless of them being singles or not, is the way they all execute their subject matter in the most interesting- if not best- way possible (This naturally excludes &quot;New Orleans Instrumental No. 1&quot;, which no matter how beautiful or atmospheric it feels, still remains an instrumental). &quot;Ignoreland&quot; is a self-aware political protest, focusing on the personal (&quot;They hypnotised the summer&quot;/&quot;They amplified the autumn&quot;/&quot;Theydesecrated winter&quot;/&quot;1979&quot;) &amp; its powerlessness (&quot;If they weren't there we would have created them. Maybe it's true, but I'm resentful all the same. Someone's got to take the blame. I know that this is vitriol. No solution, spleen-venting, but I feel better having screamed. Don't you?&quot;). &quot;Ignoreland&quot; epitomises protest songs the same way &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot; &amp; &quot;Find The River&quot; respectively epitomise crisis &amp; escape &amp; the same way every song on the album epitomises its subject matter, no matter how idiosyncratically oblique it seems.<br />Bottom line is, this is the one R.E.M. album everyone can enjoy, as many non-fans did, do &amp; will keep doing. You don't have to know anything about the band before you buy it, &amp; whilst comparing it to Green &amp; Out Of Time (&amp; indeed, the IRS albums) enhances the effect, it's ultimately not that necessary. A perfect album for the road (it's no coincidence that the first song title goads you to drive) &amp; a lifetime companion, whenever you are feeling trapped in a place or state you shouldn't be in just put on R.E.M. &amp; all of a sudden the world outside seems a little more beautiful.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Let's face it, if you have true fanboy dedication, you're going to buy \\"Rise Of The Machines\\" even though you know deep in your heart that \\"Judgement Day\\" surpasses the lastest installment in the Terminator trilogy by leaps and bounds.  I think all of us can agree on two points...<br />1. The Terminator was never meant to be cute and funny, so why make him that way now?<br />2. The T-1000 was a far more dangerous threat than the new female Terminator.<br />To say that T3 is a better film than T2 is an insult, but that doesn't mean it's not worthy of your hard earned cash.  I'm excited for this movie, and I can't wait for it's release.
B000068PQ0|5.0|You hear the opening words of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, and you know that you're in for 47 minutes and 30 seconds of pure bliss.  The first time I heard this album, the melodies were echoing throughout my head for days.  It is an album full of richly-textured beats, clever instrumentation, and Wayne Coyne's quirky but delicious lyrics.  Who is Yoshimi you ask?  I have no clue.  And who are these Pink Robots that she's battling?  No idea.  However, once you hear the title track, it suddenly starts to make sense, and all those ridiculous questions go out the window.  Then you hear part 2 with Yoshimi battling the robots with her sonic screams and you're hooked.  This is quite possibly their best album yet and I hope the next is even better!

B00006LLNU|5.0|The music of Sigur Ros is gorgeous.  This album is a spine-tingling journey with songs so lovely that titles would do no justice to their beauty.  It is an album that is so powerful that while you're listening to it, it will transform everything you see into something completely beautiful.  It is like nothing I've ever heard before, and they deserve huge amounts of praise for it.  Some say that their music is sad and depressing, but everyone has times like these, and a perfect way to spend these times is by listening to this album.  What therapy!!!  The only problem with this album is that when it is over, you are launched back into the perils of reality.
B00002ND77|4.0|And I firmly believe Malcolm X was a true American. He was passionately, almost obsessively, commited to his ideas. He valued justice. He understood discipline. Yet, he showed undeniable strength and compassion when he realized that some of his beliefs no longer served his spiritual needs. To me, that is the ultimate struggle for ANYONE who tries to call America home.<br />Spike Lee's treatment of Malcolm X never degenerates into hagiography, race baiting, or worse, Hollywood stereotype. Instead he -- and of course, Denzel Washington's tour de force performance -- presents Malcolm the myth, the martyr and the man. What better dichotomy is there for someone forever enshrined in the pantheon of American fame? I hope we never forget his legacy...<br />This movie left me energized, angry, confused and hopeful all at the same time. Soon after, I mustered up the courage to read Malcolm's autobiography and was equally moved by it. Thank you, Spike for the inspiration.
B00005JMFR|1.0|very disapointing. after an amazing buildup with the first two movies revolutions just leaves you flat. no wonderful plot twists, no answers, and an ending that feels like it was made up at the last seccond and slaped onto the end of an otherwise amazing trilogy. The movie itself was not horrible, the action and final battle was amazing, but you, whoever you happen to be reading this, could have come up with a better way to end this trilogy. unfortunately, and very unlike parts 1 and 2, revolutions will not blow your mind.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Did you LOVE the first movie. I mean, REALLY LOVE it? Then nothing I write will stop you from throwing your money at this ridiculous trash. You're better off sticking to the fawning 5-star reviews to validate your decision. (And to the reviewer who wrote that this was the \\"Greek Tragedy of the XXI Century\\", now THAT'S really funny. Thanks.)<br />There's not  enough pot in the world to make me think that this film is anything more than an over-blown college dorm fantasy, from the stoooopid, endless \\"rave\\" sequence in Zion's catacombs (wow, didn't know living underground all your life can still give you such beautiful skin!) to the awful dialogue during that restaurant scene. I estimate that that scene alone must've had 15 pages of script devoted entirely to yammering. And this is supposed to be an action flick?<br />In all, the film was plodding, boring and lame, including the action sequences. And the \\"philosophy\\" that we're supposed to take away from it is downright laughable. I think the Wachowski Brothers had too much money and too many bong hits when they made this.<br />By the time the Frenchman showed up I didn't know or care what he was supposed to be. Human? Program? Loki? Id? Cupid? Maybe he's just French, and that's good enough. Yeah, and so's the exit because I nearly walked out by this point. I'd like to say I had the munchies, but truth is, I didn't give a rat's what was going to happen next. <br />Oh, and here's another doozy that is stripped right from the pages of Maxim: if Trinity lets this hottie (the Frenchman's wife) smoke Neo, Planet Earth could be saved. I'm not kidding. Make sense? Of course not. Reefer to my earlier comment about the Wachowskis' influences.<br />And as to the whole Matrix  phenomenon, I'm beginning to think  it's really for crybabies my age (30s) who see this as some sort of adolescent video-game fantasy to deliver them from their imaginings of a controlling, corporate lifestyle. Boo hoo. Of course these fanboys worship Neo the Hero: \\"I get to be cool and aloof, a kick-butt karate expert, wear shades, and be an Internet Messiah. I even get the hottest babe, too! Yesssssss!.\\" Yeah, I identified with those values. When I was 14.<br />I wasn't a huge fan of the first \\"Matrix\\" to begin with, but I was entertained. Nice bit of brain candy. Having seen the bloated Reloaded, I think the whole thing is just Hollywood noise. I definitely pass on the last (I hope) installment.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This is my album of the year. It is built by an old favourite using some of his pet sounds but constructed differently.  Robert Christgau seemed put off by the length of the songs and others have commented that the basic blues shuffles are predictable and boring.  For me the music grows with repeated listening and the sparse sound of the three piece Crazy Horse is different.  It reminds me of the acoustic moments on Zuma.  The guitar shuffles remind me of those on Jimmy Reed's Greatest (on Rhino).  (Neil has been dropping enough hints in interviews) A+
B00007KWHP|4.0|While 1971's The Yes Album gave Yes their first exposure in the United States, Fragile was their first bona fide hit album.  Cosmic keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought into replace the talented but dangerously unadventurous Tony Kaye, thus completing the \\"classic Yes\\" lineup.  The album consisted of four true songs, and five short-form compositions from each of the band members.  It's a concept that works rather well.<br />The opener \\"Roundabout\\" was a huge hit, and rightfully so.  Every single aspect of the song- vocals, guitars, keyboards, drums, and especially Chris Squire's ferocious and unrelenting bass- are perfect, and blended together to create one of the greatest classic rock songs of all time.  No matter how many times I hear this on the radio, I'll never get tired of it.<br />\\"South Side Of The Sky\\" is one of my all-time favorite Yes songs.  This is a band that rarely treads on the darker side of music, but when they do, it works great (i.e., future classics like \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\" and \\"Machine Messiah\\").  Bill Bruford gives a stupendous performance- it's probably the closest to straightforward rock `n' roll as this jazz fusion drummer would ever get.  Guitarist Steve Howe gives a hard and heavy performance comparable to Led Zeppelin.  The middle section of the song, with Wakeman's foreboding piano and the gorgeous vocal harmonies, is the highlight of the entire album for me.<br />The three and a half minute \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" is pretty typical of early-70's AOR, but it's great nonetheless, with its playful guitar and rich rhythm section.  \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" is the longest song Yes had recorded up to that point at eleven minutes.  This is a true fan favorite that is played at most every Yes concert.  However, to offer a dissenting opinion, I don't like this song.  The opening section, while seeming brilliant the first time you hear it, loses its effect after being repeated ad nauseam what seems like constantly throughout the song.  Jon Anderson gives an impressive unaccompanied vocal performance, but it really doesn't fit in the context of the song.  \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" is just plain boring, to put it bluntly.  It seems like it belongs on Yes's 1974 dud \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans.\\"<br />The \\"solo\\" pieces are a mixed bag.  Rick Wakeman's \\"Cans And Brahms\\" is pointless, as is Bill Bruford's 35-second \\"5% For Nothing\\" (even though it is interesting from a technical standpoint).  Jon Anderson's \\"We Have Heaven\\" is upbeat and comical- it's a very fun little ditty.  Steve Howe's acoustic solo \\"Mood For A Day\\" is good, but pales in comparison to the live version on 1973's Yessongs.  Chris Squire's \\"The Fish (Shindleria Praematurus)\\" is easily the best of the solo spots- not only is it incredibly impressive; it's also very fun to listen to.  \\"The Fish\\" is presented as an add-on to \\"Long Distance Runaround.\\"<br />The bonus tracks include an early mix of \\"Roundabout\\" which is interesting to listen to once, but then becomes pointless, as it's not much different than the final version.  Yes's cover of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"America\\" is a masterpiece.  It's kind of misleading to call this a cover, as the only resemblance it has to the original is the lyrics.  Steve Howe gives what is in my opinion his greatest guitar solo on the ten-minute track.  If this were part of Fragile proper, it would be its best song.<br />The remastered and expanded Fragile is definitely a must-have for any music fan, if only for \\"Roundabout,\\" \\"South Side Of The Sky,\\" and \\"America.\\"derson gives an impressive unaccompanied vocal performance, but it really doesn't fit in the context of the song.  \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" is just plain boring, to put it bluntly.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|I tell you what it is. People are judging this record according to their expectations. Such expectations are set up sky high that it becomes really impossible for Sarah or any artist for that matter to attain. People are expecting perfection all the time from her. Well, guess what? She's only human.<br />For me, I hear Afterglow and what I find is a collection of beautifully crafted songs, as we have come to expect from Sarah. Which brings to mind another problem: the music climate has changed so much that what is considered &quot;good&quot; music now is anything that's really loud ie rock, recycled crap ie rap and karaoke singers seems to be the height of music culture right now. Any female worth much in the industry has to at least take her clothes off in a video and show some skin in order to get attention. Anything else that doesn't fit into these narrowly-focused &quot;rock-n-roll&quot; ideals fall short in people's eyes. <br />Sarah has chosen to stay true to herself and made a record that is meaningful and emotionally-satisfying. It is quiet and low-key but it has been said that the most powerful moments can be found in silences and quietness is the loudest roar. She has chosen to disregard all music trends and fads and creates music that is relevant enough in current times yet sound timeless in its appeal. Contrary to what some reviewers have posted here, all the songs are very much varied in sound and not &quot;samey&quot; at all.<br />Open you ears to Fallen and hear the open regret, the fatalistic hopeless feeling that a mistake made can never be corrected brings. Read the lyrics in World on Fire and tell me that that is not one of the best songs ever written about the post 911 world? People say she doesn't rock, well please hear Stupid! Not only does she rock out, she actually sounds mightily pissed. <br />In Drifting, she gathers you up into the skies into drifting clouds and you understand why there it's so irresistable to escape from life. Then you'rebrought down to earth again in Trainwreck where Sarah revels in being an impending disaster and you're taken by her vulnerability. Push is Sarah's love poem to her husband and it's a suitably direct and heartfelt declaration of love. <br />Answer...what can one say about Answer? The most emotionally wrecking song on the album. If there is anyone that you ever truly love and need, you'll relate to this song. The lyrics are simple yet say so much. In Time, Sarah gives us a dark glimpse into a broken relationship that involves her ruminating about &quot;shadows on the walls&quot; keeping her company and being held as a token. The Celtic-like drumming bores into your ears as if Father Time is urgently telling you that it's best to let go of things that ails you.<br />Perfect Girl is the perfect ode to anyone who has yet to find himself or herself. Listen to her sing &quot;And everything will come around in time&quot; in a high note, as if singing in a high note could bring down the heavens and the Perfect Girl would indeed believe everything will indeed be alright for her. Imagine yourself in a bar or at home and you had too much to drink. You listen to Dirty Little Secret and you're reminded of why you got into that drunken state....much self-loathing and plenty of regret. The pleasantness of the music is deceiving as it hides a broken soul who, as the lyrics go, denied himself a capacity to love. The song ends in resigned acceptance of his lot.<br />In a way, this resigned acceptance could be similarly ascribed to Sarah. She's no longer the person she was. She's changed by motherhood and by the death of her mother. No one can expect her to make another Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. She's not a music machine who cranks out records every two years or so. <br />Afterglow is just one part of her journey. A journey which I hope, will take her to greater heights one day and inspire her to write a record that transcends everything she or anyone else has ever done. For me, I'lltake Afterglow for what it is: as a slice of Sarah's artistic journey and enjoy it while I can.
B000001FDQ|3.0|No doubt, Yngwie Malmsteen is a brilliant guitar player, but you'll never catch me listening to this album for more than 10 minutes. <BR>Being a guitar player, I can certainly appreciate his style and technique. What I can't stand is the unimaginitive songwriting and the &quot;so-bad-they're-hilarious&quot; lyrics.<BR>Furthermore, Yngwie plays furiously, but he doesn't play soulfully...doesn't allow that guitar to sing for more than 2 seconds. I'm not saying that he should shove a slide on his finger and play me some memphis blues, but it would be nice to hear a little more than some speedy symphonies from this guy. After all, it isn't what you play. It's how you play it.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|In a nutshell; I will have to reinforce the comments of several previous reviewers.  The film combined significant historical inaccuracy with a series of very clumsy rip offs of the dramatic high points of the film Das Boot.  Viewing the original requires a three hour time commitment, but it is truly one of the best action/suspense flicks ever made.  Watching this one consisted of boredom interspersed with moments of despair involving the poorly done \\"cut and paste\\" plagiarism.
B000005HO0|4.0|this is pretty damn good. Euronymous and Necrobutcher are hardly the best rhythm section in the rock (or rock subgenre) world and I don't believe Dead actually &quot;sings&quot; on this album, (actually, I think Hellhammer is the only accomplished musician in this band) but &quot;Live In Liepzig&quot; captures the element of darkness like no other band I've heard (Pink Floyd exempt). <BR>Perhaps you have to be aware of the band's reputation to enjoy  it. The morbid &quot;slasher&quot; lyrics arent just for shock value...these guys practiced what they preached. Mayhem is often cited for being a particularly gory live act (wrist slashing and a stage adorned with impaled pigs heads courtesy of lead singer, Dead) and on their breaks, favorite activities included committing suicide, holding classified meetings in a creepy basement at an occult bookstore and burning churches. Choir boys they were not. <BR>So while not being the greatest musicians, songwriters, and producers (production is pretty bad), the album is a nice treat for anybody who likes to be shocked
B00008DDXB|1.0|Ugg!This movie bordered on the worst movie I have ever seen. If you haven't read the book you might be able to put up with the tacky comuter animated effects; aweful acting on Harry, Hermione, Ron and most of the other charactors parts; terrible script; horrid kiddy jokes and a sickening twist on the origanal story line. The movie was only slightly improved by the acting abilities of the teachers, but this was overshadowed by the Harry's complete lack of expresion, stage presence, and in general, talent! This was not helped by the cloudy climax that most couldn't understand. The script does not explain what is going on very well and is difficult to follow for anyone, especially little kids. The charactors were not upheld. Ron is suposed to be a tall boy, generally annoyed about some thing, acording to Rowling's book. the movie protrayed him as short, nerdy and scared of pretty much everything. The most irritating change I thought was of Harry's change from a short, courageous, green-eyed, almost normall boy with a temper, to a tall, wimpy, blue-eyed, quiet, expresionless angel boy. This movie has totally changed my views on the book in a negitive way. I now cannot read the book with out imagining little annoying kids in my head! Do not see this if you have any intention of ever reading the book!!
B00002Z83J|5.0|Rory Gallagher's &quot;Calling Card&quot; was never a huge commercial success and it will probably never make a top 100 albums list, but those who are lucky enough to know Rory's work are aware that this is perhaps the greatest album ever recorded. <BR>First off, I can't overemphasize the incredible musicianship this album offers. Rory Gallagher was one of the most amazing guitar players who ever lived. Give him shred, blues, jazz, folk, rockabilly, he could play it and any given subgenre flawlessly. Also, he was a tasteful player. No &quot;excess&quot; noodling and repetitive A minor runs here. &quot;Calling Card&quot; also features the stunning Lou Martin on piano, Gerry McAvory on bass (great chemistry between he and Rory) and the enormously talented Rod de'Arth on drums. <BR>There's no shortage of good rockin' tunes on &quot;Calling Card&quot;. Most notably, &quot;Country Mile&quot;, &quot;Jackknife Beat&quot;, and the almost Deep Purple-esque &quot;Moonchild&quot;. <BR>But there's something for everybody, including the jazz/blues fusion title track, the melancholy acoustic number &quot;I'll Admit You're Gone&quot;, the folk jam &quot;Barley and Grape Rag&quot;, and arguably the best track, &quot;Edged In Blue&quot; (which might have been a hit for Rory had he decided to release singles).<br />I urge anybody to give &quot;Calling Card&quot; a listen. Without a doubt, you'll be hooked
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I was about 4 years old when I remember hearing Dire Straits' \\"Love Over Gold\\" play, in 1983.  I grew up listening to classic rock...and in terms of shear musical talent, Dire Straits has always been unparalleled in their genre.  Browsing some of these reviews, a few criticize the band for being too mellow.  But, children, music wasn't always Korn, Limp Bizkit, and other mindless bands of today.  One of the things that was/still is appealing about Brothers In Arms (and all Dire Straits music) is the song writing of Mark Knopfler.  From long, jazzy journeys to hard pop hits, the man was a genuine craftsman.  I may be biased since I was listening to them from a young age, but if you sit down and just listen to the instrumentation, the lyrics...you'll see that each song has something to say.  And to me, many of the songs are easily accessible ... catchy with a hook.  If you're from the boyband generation, well this might test your limited attention span.  But if you're 21+, and you enjoy classic rock and music from the 80s, ...well this might just be up your alley.  After all, the band sold millions of copies of Brothers in Arms and it's predecessor, \\"Love Over Gold\\".
B000056JYB|4.0|When Blind Faith released their &quot;maiden&quot; album in 1968, it only consisted of 6 tracks, all of which were excellent, but I think we all wanted to hear more. <BR>Well, after 32 years, the vaults were opened the songs remastered, and here we are with a 17 track double album!<BR>The first CD is just excellent. There are 5 extra tracks on this one: Sleeping in the Ground, Can't Find My Way Home[Electric Version], Acoustic Jam, Time Winds, Sleeping in the Ground [Slow Blues Version]. All of them are great...everything I would have wanted on this package except for the slow, tedious &quot;Acoustic Jam&quot; which sounds more like elevator music than anything else. <BR>The 2nd CD I was especially anxious to hear. Clapton, Baker, Gretch and Winwood just letting it all flow...sounds exciting doesn't it? Actually, it really isn't. The jams are long, good in some parts, unbearably boring in others.<BR>But, though CD 2 was somewhat disappointing, I still reccommend the set. There really are some fine numbers that were cut from the original and it's a priviledge to hear them at last!
B0000C9V3T|2.0|I loved the song played when the bride cuts off sophie's arm. This song is not on the cd ,however. And nobody seems to know what its name is. So if you do please post. As for the others on the CD - they are pretty good, give the general feel of the movie. Its an eclectic collection.
B0000067L2|5.0|For the holy grail of psychedelic blues, you don't have to dig through the archives of one hit wonders and obscure garage bands. Look no further than Cream's &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;.<BR>Ginger Baker, Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce have concocted the perfect formula here: intense jazz drumming, intricate AND tasteful wah-wah guitar solos, heavy bass, imaginative lyrics, and some hot blues riffs.<BR>But perhaps the best thing about &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; is the chemistry between the members. All 3 of them can be soloing at once and it doesn't sound at all muddy or confused<br />So, do yourself a favor. Check it out!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Fasten your seat belts. My dear God - this closing of the trilogy makes the entire \\"Star Wars\\" series look like \\"Little House On The Prairie\\". The Wachowski's cram it all in: disparate philosophies, more martial arts, heretical Judeo-Christian legends, Eastern leanings, stunning cinematography, mind-numbing special effects and a raucous, full-blown homage to Hideo Kojima's \\"Metal Gear Solid\\".  <br />Definitely a movie I both want and need to see again, for the strong undercurrent of philosophical and spiritual implications has left me a bit dazed. But that's the genius of the filmmakers: if all you want is wicked special effects, a solid plot, lots of action and the obligatory hotties, then you'll come away sated. But as Morpheus said, just how deep does the rabbit hole go? If you choose to dig a little deeper, you'll discover a multitude of hidden meanings and sub-plots. <br />The Merovingians. Karma. Christ's decension. Causality. King-Fu. On and on and on, and yet the Wachowskis are somehow able to make a cohesive story out of it all. <br />It seems like everyone's split right down the middle on this one, and quite vociferously. If I look all the way back to Neo hiding his stash in a copy of Baudrillard's \\"Simulacra and Simulations\\", nearly everything makes perfect sense:<br />\\"The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth -it is the truth which conceals that there is none.\\"
B000053ZS6|2.0|The hoary Welsh geezer warbler with gold medallions clanging off his hairy barrels and more socks in his drawers than his er... drawers, makes a slight return for this oddity who's-who? collaboration collection of curious power-Vegas deconstructed mod-pop and rock hits. Folks like the Cardigans, Stereophonics and Van Morrison step in to help the dim man's Otis Redding crank up the testerone croak enunciation suitably for a few great squealing, squalling, cocks-out, huge-bollocked, grunting, sweat-stained and throbbing mucho-macho show tune duet covers. Rarely does Jonesy invigorate the songs of others (Are You Gonna Go My Way?, Burning Down the House, Sexbomb, Little Green Bag); rather, it's the generous miasma of straight-faced, carbon-dated braggadocio -grunts, groans, whoos! hahs! -tossed like croutons in his seizure salad of reanimated retirement home mojo histrionics that make this a hoot to hear. Like the social security sex monster on show here, Reload shakes and moans admirably top and bottom, but the midsection is a saggy mess of embarrassing dough (Sunny Afternoon, I'm Left You're Right, You Need Love Like I Do, Looking Out My Window). A simple work like Portishead's B-movie electronica hit All Mine completely sinks him (with cohorts Divine Comedy), though he and fellow antique Van Morrison fare no better with the jumbo leprechaun's Sometimes We Cry -deconstructed here as a sniggly wad of boozey retro-cheese. But when it's bad, it's so bad it's a scream. Look no further than Grones' wagging, insipid and ultimately hilarious neuter of David Bowie and Iggy Pop's old glam/punk Lust For Life. Even Chrissie Hynde's cranky harp and hardened croak aren't strong enough to stifle Jone's straight-laced emasculation - or the resulting giggles. \\"Of course, I've had it in the ear before,\\" he shudders, hips a jiggling and sock a wiggling. Thanks to Reload, you'll get it in the ear too, over and over again. What fun! Mum, if she isn't busy tossing her knickers at theCD player, will be proud.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This is an incredible collection of AKUS songs played flawlessly.  Alison and the boys delivering their musical talent and awesome vocal performance to a live double cd set.  They come slamming home with an awesome performance that seems so good it's hard to believe it was played live!  For anybody that loves bluegrass, this is a must have.  Those of you that are unfamiliar with it, don't be afraid to get this.  You won't be disappointed!!!
B000088E6P|4.0|The reason why i say if you have a CD burner, burn this CD, is because, well, its a great CD, but some of the songs, you just get tired of hearing afterwards. But songs like, U not like me, wanksta, poor lil rich, and high all the time. I could never get tired of. And as for Ava. If hope yer a girl man, cause wit a name like that seems like you gon' get punked all da time. And if you feel like yer in the position to be talkin all that kinna sh*t about 50, against what probably more than a million people say(that hes a great artist) then where the f*ck is yer CD you've put out on da market lately? If you aint got a CD out then DONT TALK SH*T. And quit being a hater. Just because 50 is burning the kinna money you would never see in yer life for firewood!
B00008PX8P|5.0|The greatest band of all time brought to you live.  What more can you ask for?  This is a must have DVD to add to your collection.  Their raw and unbelievable performances show all wannabe rockers what a real band sounds like!  Plant's vocals are incredible.  Along with one of the all-time greats, Jimmy Page shows how a guitar was supposed to be played.  Don't miss out on John Bohnam's reckless abandon on the drums.  And don't forget about John Paul Jones.  There will never be another band like this.  If you never had the privilage of seeing them live, make sure you don't miss out on these performances!  Put it in, sit back, and prepare to be amazed!  It simply doesn't get any better than this.
B00005JMFR|5.0|WOW was the only word that came to mind when I saw this movie. Absolutely Breathtaking. Definately worth the money.
B00005JMFR|2.0|First of all I am a great fan of the first two Matrix movies.  This movie gave me no closure at all.  It seemed more toward the end that not even the directors knew how to end such a massive movie so they ended the movie the quickest way they knew how.  The storyline has no movement whatsoever and the actress that replaced the old oracle is not very good.  Not only that but the movie seemed to try and focus in on her changing in some stupid way.  I really didn't like this movie and I know that any fan will go to the theater and see it despite what I say, but I really do just recommend that you continue to watch the first and second Matrix.  Leave the end to imagination and don't watch this third movie.  The only good thing I can say about the movie is that the battles between Zion and the machines is awesome.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Short and sweet. The philosophy was nill, the story line did not progress, the dialogue was predicatble as was the story itself.<br />The special effects were lovely, though the battles themselves were without passion, vigor, fear, or anything other than high tech combat.<br />Trinity stole this movie, her scenes were the only ones of depth and true character. This film was no fault of the actors, it simply was not written to do anything other than end.
0156012197|5.0|A satire on adulthood, this book is like a cosmic 'Gulliver's Travels'. Some have tried to dismiss it as merely a bedtime story for adults, but to do so is to miss its profound message. This message resonates at the deepest levels of the human experience --- be a kid again! See the world through unjaded eyes.... With kernals of wisdom like: \\"What is essential is invisible\\", it touches the very soul of the reader. Antoine de Saint-Exupery has become something of a literary saint due to the enduring popularity of this work. The fact that he mysteriously disappeared in a small plane he was piloting almost 60 years ago only adds to his mystique. Whatever your literary leanings, this book should be required reading for EVERYONE!
B00005JMFR|1.0|If this movie was a high-budget Saturday Night Live sketch, or possibly under the direction of Mel Brooks, I wouldn't have felt as guilty laughing. Not that it wasn't worth the money I paid. I would gladly see it again; it's a good ab workout.<br />But I'm being mean. To their credit they did use Reeves to the best of his dramatic ability and managed to give the audience a wonderful exploration of what CGI can do - even when it's rushed, overused, and doesn't have the dramatic framework to make it believable. And who would've guessed you could have such a prolonged monologue with a metal spike through both your kidneys? Ah, the wonders of cinema.<br />Still, I suggest you see it. If for nothing else than such classic lines as: \\"you did it\\" - \\"no ... *we* did it.\\" The Wachowski brothers certainly left me as they did with the first Matrix movie ... speechless.
0393317552|3.0|have read \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" because my sister indicated it to me as a good reading. It really is a good reading, specially given the astounding set of facts that the author lists for the benefit of his theory, which basically tries to address the following question: why did the europeans conquer the world and not the other way around? Not being an apologetic text, quite to the contrary, the author wants to demonstrate that what is behind the dominion of West over East is assigned to factors well beyond the control of any given human race, but mainly attributable to the play of factors not the least imputed to any race supremacy. Notwhidstanding all this, he ascertains that the earlier the domestication of animals and some varieties of staples and cereals, the more prone are human beings to be innoculated against the vagraries of some virus or disease.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|I think that 2Fast2Furious didn't spend to much time on the moive. The rush everything to make sure when it was time to release the movie it would be done so the views could go out and see it. There where only 2 races in the whole movie and not to many cars to look at. To me The Fast and Furious kills this movie by far.
B000002JS6|5.0|I bought this CD last year with the new epic version. I still can not give it a break from the CD player I truely love this CD. The sound is better than the orginal also their is videos on the CD if you pop it into your computer. The booklet included has out of this world pictures of all the band members at their best. And the song list is HELLS BELLS, SHOOT TO THRILL, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR MONEY HONEY, GIVIN THE DOG A BONE, LET ME PUT MY LOVE INTO YOU, BACK IN BLACK, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, HAVE A DRINK ON ME, SHAKE A LEG, AND ROCK AND ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION. Enjoy!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Basically, the movie rocks.  I have seen a ton of action/kung-fu/anime type movies and this one really delivers on all fronts.  There were so many tangents on the second film, that it is actually nice that you reach an actual ending in Revolutions, unlike so many art noueveau movies today.  What is interesting to me is that contrary to popular belief, you can actually see this movie spawning more, but I won't give that away.  But I will say this, if you are a DBZ fan (Dragon Ball Z) you can really see how some scenes were taken from anime type movies towards the end.  Woo hoo!<BR>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY ANIMATRIX, AS IT SETS YOU UP FOR THIS MOVIE!!  <BR>OK, well buy it and hopefully there will be a 4th film. Or at least a second Animatrix.  I'm banking on it.
B00005JMFR|5.0|ok people!!<br />please dont judge the film on the ending which made no sence wat so ever!! the film up to that was one of the best matrix's i have ever seen maybe not at good as the first but better then reloaded!! <br />dont give up on the  matrix yet so it was a bad ending ok that destoryed the whole 3 films and personal i wanted neo to take over the matrix or something and trinity dieing was out of order but thats the way things are and we cant change it now!!!<br />i love the matrix please dont judge all 3 films by one bad ending.<P(...)
B000002U88|4.0|The title came from a lyric to the first track EVEN NOW(&quot;out in THE DISTANCE,always within reach). MAKIN' THUNDERBIRDS is about production of the popular automobile(back in '55,we were MAKIN' THUNDERBIRDS). Bonnie Raitt sings background vocals on the track. BOOMTOWN BLUES sounds pretty cool especially with Alto Reed's saxophone. SHAME ON THE MOON is a nice country ballad written by Rodney Crowell. LOVE'S THE LAST TO KNOW is a beautiful love ballad that didn't gain as much attention as WE'VE GOT TONIGHT. ROLL ME AWAY,as Bob Seger recalled on the GREATEST HITS album,&quot;the song was originally intended to be 'full throttle' completely,but instead it started in a subtle manner&quot; That song has the Bruce Springsteen sound(as if it were recorded by Springsteen and his E Street Band). HOUSE BEHIND A HOUSE and LITTLE VICTORIES are OK songs. COMIN' HOME is the pre-swan song &quot;calm&quot; song. This album was released in late 1982,nearly three years after Seger's last studio album AGAINST THE WIND and right around the time that his Capitol Records' labelmates Duran Duran released their RIO album.
B00006JDS4|4.0|Well, now all the folks who wish writer/director Meir Zarchi would explain his controversial, infamous, and disturbing rape and revenge film can get their wish for the price of this Millennium edition DVD, which includes a feature-length commentary by Zarchi.  In this commentary, Zarchi confirms what this film's defenders (including me) have been claiming all along -- that his intention was definitely not to promote rape to his male viewers, but rather to expose the true ugliness of the crime.  He talks at length about the real-life encounter with a rape victim that inspired the film, and about the people he worked with in making it.  He also discusses the technical aspects in enough detail to prove this is not the shoddy, haphazard production some folks want to claim it is.  I also learned a few interesting facts about the film business in general.  For example, when you submit a movie to the MPAA, they'll tell you it has to be cut to get an R rating, but they won't tell you WHAT to cut.<br />Besides answering your questions about the film, Zarchi's commentary also provides a clue as to what sort of person he is.  Overall, he comes across as intelligent, articulate, and even compassionate.<br />However, he also comes across as a bit egotistical, which is why the second feature-length commentary by Joe Bob Briggs is useful for its more balanced perspective.  Although Briggs defends the movie, pointing out specific scenes that exemplify its anti-rape viewpoint, he's objective enough to point out flaws where he sees them.  For example, why on earth did Johnny send the mentally-challenged Matthew back to the house to kill Jennifer, when Matthew was almost certain to bungle the job?  Briggs also addresses two ethical questions that have always bothered me.  The first is whether Matthew deserves to die, and the second is whether Johnny's wife and children deserve to have their husband/father respectively taken away from them.<br />This DVD also includes various trailers, TV spots, and posters, including some promoting the movie under its original title, DAY OF THE WOMAN.  There are also posted from a wide assortment of countries, in a wide assortment of languages.  I wish the extras had also included the original version of the opening, with the title DAY OF THE WOMAN in the credits, but maybe there are no prints in existence.<br />So, if you want to own this movie on DVD, this is the edition to buy.  If you own an earlier edition, you might consider selling it to raise part of the price of this one.TV spots, and posters, including some promoting the movie under its original title, DAY OF THE WOMAN.

B00005OAE6|5.0|Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band have experienced the endless success of their albums LIVE BULLET and NIGHT MOVES. In the spring of 1978,came STRANGER IN TOWN. Hits from the album are HOLLYWOOD NIGHTS,STILL THE SAME,OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL and WE'VE GOT TONIGHT. Seger tells stories behind those songs in 1994's GREATEST HITS. But I know STILL THE SAME is an ode to gamblers. OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL re-entered the pop charts in 1983 when the movie &quot;Risky Business&quot;,starring 21-year-old Tom Cruise,was theatrically released. WE'VE GOT TONIGHT was covered that same year by Kenny Rogers and Sheena Easton and was a hit. The other 5 songs,FEEL LIKE A NUMBER,BRAVE STRANGERS,TILL IT SHINES,AIN'T GOT NO MONEY and THE FAMOUS FINAL SCENE are all good. Isn't it unbelievable that this album is a quarter century old now? David Teegarden succeeds the retired Charlie Allen Martin as the Silver Bullet Band drummer. Keyboardist Robyn Robbins quit the band after this album.
067101756X|2.0|The biggest mystery about this book, even bigger than the supposed existence of a hostile alien race that may or may not have lost a spaceship outside of Roswell in '47, is why Philip Corso's mantlepiece is not currently groaning under the weight of Nobel Prizes for physics ? For, if this book is accurate, then Philip Corso and Philip Corso alone is responsible for the ideas in many diverse fields that led to the development of many new technologies.<br />Because, in the author's own humble words iterated several timwes throughout - &quot;I realised that perhaps what this was for was (fill in - Starlight Optics, Lasers for medical and military and range-finding use, Particle-Beam weapons etc etc etc)&quot;. Single-handedly Corso discovered what alien technologies did and also thought of the ways to exploit them ! This must be deeply distressing news for the hardworking scientists who really developed all this stuff. However, as Corso explains, they were in on the secret as he fed them info and let them hold any patents fof the new stuff. So that explains that. Humble guy.<br />This might have been believable has Corso gotten his scientific facts right, but facts, like concrete evidence, are thin on the ground in this flight of fancy. The effects of microwaves for instance were, depending on which side of the Atlantic you happen to be on, discovered by either RAF radar technicians who found cooked sparrows by radar stations in 1941 or by Doctor Spencer of Raytheon in 1946 who noticed that a candy bar in his pocket had melted when working with radar. (The former is more believable for more than the obvious patriotic reasons for one wonders why no other part of Doctor Spencer was affected by the microwaves). In any event, neither of these histories of microwave discovery appear in Corso's work and so it goes through the other fields. <br />The works laying the foundation of fibre-optics appeared in 1951, some ten years before Corso's &quot;brainwave&quot; when pondering the Roswell find. Admittedly, the first concrete proposals for the application of fibre-optics were put forth in 66, but the point remains, the idea for them was hard graft by scientists ten years earlier. What's more Dutch and English scientists lest people object they were given their ideas by the US military.<br />And on it goes, example after example of how this technology really came about from previous research predating the Roswell crash can be put forth to utterly refute Corso's claim. For we only have Corso's word that his is indeed the case. Corso gives us no evidence of his story. All the photographs are of him or are plucked from other UFO sources. The appendix &quot;official&quot; documents are largely unsigned. The schematics therein able to have been produced by any Star-Trek buff, not any competent scientist. Conveniently, Corso's superior is dead and thus can't refute any of Corso's astounding claims.<br />Not that really they need refuting. If you are unable to refute this yourself after 10 minutes on a good search engine, then there's a bridge in Brooklyn I want to sell you. Gets two stars for being entertainingly written.

0802130208|1.0|I love characters that fly in the face of conventionality.  I love irreverant characters who challenge the way we see the world.<br />Ignatius is neither of these.  His rantings on the ills of society from the safety of his bedroom in his mother's house were empty and silly.  He is a completely unbelievable character, or at least one with whom I could not empathize.  His twisted view of the world is so anathema to the realm of common experience that I'm surprise anyone can put themselves in it.<br />Try as hard as I did, I couldn't raise enough interest in the characters to even finish this book.  <br />Read John Irving instead -- He's much funnier, can turn reality in interesting twists and still be believable, and has more important things to say about what it is to be a human being in the world.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I did not believe that the dvd craze had much more to offer over VHS,until I witnessed this at a friends place about a year ago.So I figured out a way to sell my wife on buying a nice system and I am now officially hooked.I own about 25 DVD concerts and S&M is still my reference.Ilove all kinds of music and my collection reflects that,but this DVD ,technically &sonically,is still the most complete DVD I own.Visually,it stands up to repeated viewings because it is tastefully shot & free of the headache inducing MTV 1 to 3 second cuts.The orchestrations compliment the songs greatly & allow for a deeper appreciation of the songs.The true measure of this disc though,is the sound.I still get goosebumps when I pop in this disc.Superbly mixed,thunderous bass extension,& the best use of surrounds(in the flesh by roger waters a close second)I have heard.The band is truely inspired on this night.Other reviewers are right when they talk about people who weren't into Metallica,but loved this DVD.Fun for the whole family,really!10 stars!
B00005OM4N|1.0|I give Britney credit for attempting to write her own music, however, she is not a good songwriter at all. The only half decent song on the album was 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Women' which was written by Dido. The rest of the songs leave little to be desired especially the awful \\"I'm a Slave for You' and her horrible remake of the Joan Jett classic: 'I Love Rock and Roll'. She shouldn't have recorded that song in the first place. It's right up there with her horrible remake of the Stones' classic: 'Satisfaction'.<br />Like many other reviewers have written, the only reason Britney is still around is because people (mostly the teeny boppers) choose to keep on buying this garbage. Britney may be a good performer, but she certainly cannot sing. She's no Celine or Mariah.<br />She's a good example, along with fellow teeny bopper pop tart, Christina Aguilera, of how the music industry has become more about looks and sex appeal rather than true musical and vocal talent. There are alot of other so-called artists out there who are very mediocre yet continue to make tons of money.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Fortunately,  no one can be told Matrix Revolutions is a good or bad movie.  You'll just have to see it for youself.<br />Neo is the one.  Keep this in mind as you watch this movie, he has one purpose and The Architect told him what he is supposed to do. He didn't do and set into motion a chain of events which only lead him back to where he was suppose to go, and to the death of his beloved Trinity.  But it was her time anyway.  Nevertheless the movie allowed us to know that Neo died in body but he can exist outside of his body in the Matrix.  Now the cycle can begin all over again.  But what changed.  The equation that The Architect had been trying to solve.  The choice that we have, to stay in the Matrix or awaken from it and join the human race in Zion.  I think what most people wanted was to see the machines fall forever.  A plesant, and comforting thought, but not the way things work.  I think Neo has an even greater battle ahead.  The Wachowski brothers have left this open to completely either make a television series or another movie or another trilogy. I personally would like a second trilogy with the destruction of the Merovingian and the Matrix Mainframe and freedom for all mankind.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Is seraph a pointless charcter? is neo and Seraph fight poinless? <BR>NO  <BR>Why?<br />Beacuse the Oracle who is the mother of the matrix crated the way 99% of the humans behave, and she knows the limits of them, so seraph is designed to beat them all. But not the anomaly who is different from the rest. So one software (the oracles) crates a program like a defense for bad humans and other software.<br />Why seraph can't beat Neo, because he is an anomaly, the oracle doesn't fully understands him.<br />Every time you watch the movie it keeps getting better.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Being a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy, I saw the Matrix Revolutions, the final chapter in the trilogy, opening day. One word can describe it: disappointment. The hype must have gotten to me, because what I anticipated to be a \\"whoa\\" turned out to be a \\"uh\\". This movie was very confusing in many area's. Picking up where Reloaded, the second in the series, left off, we find our heroes aboard a ship with Neo and Agent Smith as a human in a coma. This is where it starts to get confusing. Without giving too much of the plot away, Neo is trapped in a world between the human world and the Matrix. It makes no sense, and there is no explanation as to just where and what this is, and how he is there without being plugged into anything. From there it's pretty straight forward. This would be fine if it had an engaging original story. No, not even close. Where Reloaded gained strength from it's weak story was the awesome visual effects which were no less than jaw dropping. However, Revolutions does not contain much action, it's mostly talk. The action it does have is awesome, I'll give it that. When the machines finally do burrow through to Zion the human resistance, mainly robots, fight them off, and this brings amazing special effects. That scene was almost 15 minutes long, and exciting every minute. However, there are only two really good action scenes in the movie. The final fight with Agent Smith was pretty good, but a bit on the short side. So Revolutions has no story nor an abundance of eye candy, so what will make people want to see it? Well, it's the conclusion to the Matrix. This alone should bring in hordes of people anxious to see Neo's fate. The conclusion to the Matrix was a decent one, if not a little clich. However, they just don't know when to stop. The end was fine, leave it at that. The last 5 minutes open it for a sequel and in my opinion, ruin the whole movie. Now, it doesn't imply a sequel, or tell you like Reloaded did, it just leaves on open, instead ofclosing the trilogy for good. As big of a fan of the Matrix as I am, I would have liked to see it closed here. It is done, over, finished. So basically the Matrix Revolutions is a mindless story without a lot of visual effects. The story it does attempt to have is confusing at best, and it leaves alot of questions unanswered. Matrix fans should definitely see this as it does end it to an extent, but anyone who hasn't seen Reloaded should steer clear, it was confusing enough for us who knew.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I will try and review this without giving away too much of the story line. I had an appointment with a friend to go see the movie this coming Friday, but when I walked past the cinemas yesterday, I just could not wait that long. <br />The movie starts of at a relatively sedated pace without any answers to the sudden twist at the end of Reloaded. But if you are an action fan, don't worry, it picks up. And you get relatively straightforward answers. <br />The movie mostly starts out in the matrix and then moves to the real world and the city of Zion. The action builds up to the fever pitch battle for Zion.<br />Some other reviewers think their questions were answered and others leave with more questions than answers. I feel it is an honestly good movie, with an end that you could not foresee and that you have to watch at least a second time to get more answers than questions. I for one like it that way.<br />It is a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat with action sequences, plot spinning and an end that keeps you guessing. I will still honour my appointment to go see it (again) this coming Friday.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's new album, \\"Afterglow\\", is yet another example of fine compositions by Sarah and amazing production by Pierre Marchand.  I don't think the new album will top \\"Solace\\" as my favourite Sarah album, but it's a well-made album with some of the best lyrics from Sarah I've ever seen (with the exception of the hideous lyrics to \\"Push\\").<br />Favourite songs:<br />1)  Fallen:  Not exactly groundbreaking, but it's touching nonetheless.<br />2)  World on Fire:  WONDERFUL production!  The song has a catchy chorus yet the lyrics are meaningful and beautifully written.<br />3)  Stupid:  I love the chorus!  Great to hear Sarah with a bit of an edge.<br />4)  Train Wreck:  I love the intro to this song.  Great lyrics and guitar work.<br />5)  Answer:  Musically very similar to \\"Angel\\", but the lyrics are far better.  Sarah sounds heavenly.<br />6)  Pretty Girl:  Has a strange introduction, but solid lyrics.  <br />My only complaint is that this album would have been better if Sarah wrote these songs on guitar.  She is a boring piano player but a stunning guitarist.  I wish she would have played more guitar on the album (she only plays electric guitar on \\"Stupid\\" and \\"Train Wreck\\") and less piano.  Hopefully next time she'll realize she writes better songs on guitar.
B00005JMFR|3.0|As hard as it sounds....  Went last night to the movie teather with great expectations, to find out what will Neo do in order to save Zion, but came out quite disappointed, with a soap opera finale......  Frankly, it's hard to understand what the Wachovsky bros. did to the series, which I tought would become Cult movies<br />IMHO, everything began to crumble in the 2nd movie, when Neo and Trinity began their love affair.... I'm not against love or romance, but I don't think that it must have such an important part in this kind of plots.<br />The highlight of this movie is the attack of Zion, the visuals are outstanding!!!!!!!!

B000002I7R|4.0|When I was thinking of writing a review for this album I thought of mentioning that Plant would really benefit from putting out a greatest hits album as although this does not have any of his classic songs such as Big Log, Ships of Fools etc this was his most consistent effort and he seemed to spend all his albums after this searching for some sort of lost chord (which he never found) that led to very good songs on mediocre albums. However I see that he has just released something akin to a greatest hits and apparently it does not have any of this album's songs on it so feel free to go out and buy both (at amazon of course).<br />Like Led Zeps first album which coincidently was probably also their best and most consistent, although in a class far above this one, the musical ideas are fairly simple but delivered with a punch, even the quiet songs are sung loudly. The vocals are quite good considering Plant had been hammering his vocal cords for over 10 years by this time and the guitarist, although no Jimmy Page, is very good. I'd class the music overall as adult heavy rock. My favourites are the very heavy Slow Dancer and the quieter Moonlight in Samosa. None of these songs are going to change your life but the whole album is a groove, even on CD.

They were accidentally brought home by Julia.  Jack soon learns that Julia is working for a company called Xymos, a nano-tech, bio-tech firm with a secret base in the Nevada desert.  They've been developing nano-machines for the military to help with spying.  But something has gone amiss and Jack is summoned to help them figure it out.  It seems that a program that Jack wrote called Pred-Prey was instilled into the nano-machines and now they're gaining some form of consciousness, killing things after being 'accidentally' set loose onto the Nevada desert.  Now someone is in DEEP DO-DO!<br />I don't mind techno-babble stories as long as they have strong characters.  But this story dragged due to the overly-descriptive passages on nano-technology and the development of it as an antagonist.<br />I read Timeline last year and wasn't very impressed by that novel either (simply because it read like a screenplay...and, what do you know!  They're making a movie out of it!  You can read my review of THAT story here at Amazon, too.).  My advice to Mr. Crichton would be to not worry about trying to keep up with the techno-world so that you can develop &quot;fresh new ideas.&quot;  Come up with fresh characters and put them in some hairy situations.  We'll follow you!  I promise.<br />D+ read.
B000002G87|4.0|I'm not sure how I avoided this blues-rock masterpiece for so long. Maybe it was Clapton's catalog over the past two decades that turned me off. <br />Glad I got on board, for this is a non-stop, through and through, dyed in wool amazing album. Everyone's already gone into the Duane Allman accolades so I won't get into that. Buy it.
B00005JKOI|3.0|I liked the main character, Andie (Molly Ringwald) a lot & I was rooting for her throughout the entire film . Maybe it's because she reminded me a lot of myself when I was in high school. She has her own unique style, which she gets flack for by the popular girls. \\"Where'd you get that - the 5 & dime store?\\" the snooty Benny asks her. And that hellish scene in gym class made my stomach churn as I recalled my own teen angst ridden days in gym class. One of Andie's best friends, Jenna (Alexa Kenin, who, sadly, died shortly after the film was released) brings humor to the awful situation by flicking Benny off & saying she hopes her breasts shrivel up and fall off. It's one of the many hilarious & memorable scenes of the film.<br />Ringwald is backed up by a strong supporting cast, including Jon Cryer, who plays her best guy friend, Duckie, who is just side-splittingly funny. In one of the funniest scenes of the film, he gets thrown in the girls bathroom by a group of nauseatingly preppy guys for trying to defend himself. \\"Wait a minute. We don't got none of this stuff in the boys room. You got doors on the stalls & a candy machine (He points to the tampon dispenser).<BR>Harry Dean Stanton has never been more adorable & endearing as Andie's father. Annie Potts is wonderful as Andie's eccentric mother figure & co-worker. James Spader is Steff, the totally creepy slimeball & best friend of Blaine (Andrew McCarthy). I dismiss the fact that he looked way too old to be in high school because he just plays the part so damn well. He hates Andie & makes fun of her in front of his crowd. Secretly though, he has had a crush on her for years & it kills him that she won't give him the time of day. Ugh, I remember creeps like that in high school. <br />What I like is that all of the characters we're cheering for change for the better. Iona stops dating losers & gets herself a classy new image. Andie's father starts to get out of his rut that he's been in since Andie's mother left them years before & looks for a job for real this time. Duckie learns to stop making unfair generalizations about the popular people once he finds out Blaine is actually a very nice guy. Blaine learns to do what he wants to do & tells Steff off & makes things right with Andie. Andie refuses to let the popular kids break her. The only thing I didn't like was the unresolved ending that doesn't really leave things on a completely positive, realistic note. Andie & Blaine still have his parents to deal with & if they're as awful as Steff desribed, Blaine just might encounter the two unpleasant words that can pop up in difficult families: disown & estrangement.<br />Wish the DVD had some special features, but the soundtrack is great & essential to building the perfect CD collection.
B000002LK1|4.0|Re-bought this on CD yesterday. Had the cassette in jr. high. This album sounds great and oddly relevant over a decade after it's initial release. Most definitly due to the recent 80s indie &quot;comeback&quot; of late. Gore and company knew what they were doing on this mesh of goth/synth/techno LP. Check it out.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Highway 61 Revisited!!!<br />The short, quick analysis........not too eloquent........ <br />Not &quot;one of Dylan's best&quot;   Not &quot;an influential watermark&quot;  (I'm making these quotes up....not completely sure, but most likely they have been used!)  <br />Highway 61 Revisited is quite simply the greatest album of all time!   Rock/Country/Jazz/ whatever.......   and there is damn fine competition out there.....(Is there anywhere/anytime a greater singer than Patsy Cline?  for example....  or does or can anyone EVER do it like the Stones????!!  or emote like Johnny Cash. or wail like John Coltrane!?)<br />Sure. there are better examples of damn near everything on this record.....except, of course SONGWRITING!!<br />but as a whole,   this has NO EQUAL.....!!   It is it's own standard. <br />Thank you , Bob!<br />I've been promised...a new CD player for Christmas,  and it'll be  SACD....and the first thing I'm gonna stick in it is Highway 61 Revisited!   <br />CRANK IT UP!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|This album is a mixed bag.  It contains several fantastic tracks (Fallen, Stupid, World on Fire) but if one digs deeper the tunes reach a disturbing level of homogeneity.  The last time I listened to it, I left for five minutes between track 6 and track 8 and when I came back I thought it was still the same song.  <br />Afterglow does not have the depth of Surfacing or the raw power of Fumbling.  On top of that, it is very short.  Because of these things, I can't help thinking McLachlan rushed this album - the production is stellar as always, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired.  It doesn't have  a lot of strong musical themes aside from the opening tracks, and lyrically it simply cannot compare with her previous albums.  It almost sounds like a collection of &quot;Surfacing&quot; B-sides with one or two new singles added.  McLachlan does not explore any new musical ground here, again unlike her previous albums.  There is no sense of evolution or progress.  Let us hope her next effort is more of one.
B00005JMFR|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it was definitely what I expected at all.    I don't want to give anything away.  You have to see it for yourself.  (...)
0553275976|4.0|Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was first published in 1987, but 16 years later it is still the best parody of the political and social scene in New York City.  Combining his everyday, \\"fly-over country\\"-style conservatism with his keen wit, Wolfe lays out a story that sends characters crashing into one another from all socioeconomic levels across the Big Apple.<br />Sherman McCoy, a stereotypical, ego-maniacal bond-trader, is Wolfe's typical protagonist.  The main plot starts when McCoy and his mistress, Maria Ruskin, take a wrong turn returning from Kennedy airport one night, leaving them lost in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx.  This is where they cross paths with Henry Lamb, a seemingly innocent kid stuck in a sad world, and Roland Auburn, a neighbor of Lamb's and local drug-dealing hoodlum.  In their haste to escape from a neigborhood within their city but light years from anything they recognize, Sherman and Maria strike Lamb with their car, critically injuring him.  Once a struggling NYC journalist learns of the story, it becomes a perfect case for the politicians, media, and attorneys to latch on to for their own selfish gain.  From there the Lamb case blows up into an ordeal beyond anyone's control, but one that could only descend into such madness in New York.<br />Wolfe's writing is funny, entertaining, and searing.  Through his fictional characters, he presents the perfect condemnation of the ridiculous excesses found in some NYC political and social circles, with specific real-life examples coming naturally to any reader's mind.
B000002UAU|2.0|If you like light pop music along the lines of Fixing A Hole or When I'm 64, this album is for you.  If you are looking for good 60s rock music, look elsewhere.  A Day in the Life and the title track are good, but they don't save the album.  Sgt. Pepper sounds more dated than any other Beatle album, with the possible exception of Rubber Soul. 2 stars
B00005Y7NK|5.0|&quot;born again&quot; was a very controversial album and cost Sabbath a lot of fans but this was unfair, as the album<br />was true to the band's style (heavy, cynical, mischievous and satanic) but the coming of Glenn hughes for the &quot;seventh star&quot; was a bullet in the head of the band, dubbed<br />a hair metal outfit. dont get me wrong, Glenn hughes is a wonderful singer but he's not for sabbath! Tony martin had A LOT to do in order to restore sabbath's credibility. by the time &quot;eternal idol&quot; was out, fans were already disillusioned by the band and &quot;headless cross&quot; went totally unnoticed by then whereas if it would have been released after &quot;mob rules&quot; the results would've been totally different. it would have been hailed as Sabbath's crowning achievement. This album is the most satanic ever done by the band. look for the lyrics and see. it also has the music to imperially back the topic up. it has the biggest collection of juicy riffs since &quot;Sabbath bloody Sabbath&quot; and frequent tempo changes make every song distinct, entertaining and still enjoyable after many ,many listens. i listened to this album hundreds of times and found out i love every song on it. the title track. &quot;call of the wild&quot; and &quot;nightwing&quot; are just a bit more special to me than the rest. tony martin's &quot;dio-esque&quot; voice is emotional, unpretentious and gives the songs the majesty and seriousness they need. he's the most underrated singer for black sabbath, he just was the right guy at the wrong time and place. i personally have already made my choice: this is the best sabbath album, followed by Sabbath bloody sabbath and Heaven and hell.
B000002UAO|2.0|With all the great music released in the 60s, 70s and 80s, I feel sorry for anyone who still has Rubber Soul in a prominant place in their listening queue.  While many bands have written songs with great riffs along the lines of Taxman, Day Tripper, and Paperback Writer, the fact is that the vast majority of Beatle tracks from '65-'67 were light pop.  Amazing how little some people actually know about this band.<br />Rubber Soul has a few redeeming tracks like Norwegian Wood and In My Life (also acoustic pop) that can be had on greatest hits compilations, with which you can hear these songs without suffering through the likes of Michelle.  2 stars.
B00005JMFR|5.0|... Revolutions is better than the first two combined. It has everything fans want.I saw it yesterday and was completely blown away by it. The fight scene at the end between Neo and Smith is incredible! The Wachowski brothers did a great job on this one. So take my advice and go check it out for yourself.
B00005JMFR|1.0|.... <BR>Meaningless characters (cute little Sati girl), pointless action, atrocious dialog, every imaginable cliche (young soldier scared he won't live up to the combat expectations of his hard boiled commander), the Matrix has become a parody of itself! Maybe this is the Wachoski's ultimate inverted joke on us hapless movie-going sheep. The oracle actress was switched as in some low budget soap opera and they spin some embarassing dialog to dress that up in appropriately philosophical Matrix verbiage.<BR>The only decent thing (mildly entertaining) was the swarms of insectoid machine attackers (at least they don't TALK for god's sake!).<BR>For cutting-edge guys, the Wachowski's are pretty pedestrian. Even their martial arts is just boring Hong Kong chop socky....
B00000J7RZ|2.0|When I was about 11, this C.D. was really good. I thought this was a great party C.D, with a few good singles on it that everyone loved to sing along to. In the long run, I've grown up,and realize that this album is mediocre, at best. Jennifer Lopez is not a singer, to put it bluntly. She doesn't belong in this industry. Now I would MUCH, MUCH! Rather listen to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. People that belong in the music industry and possess real vocal talent. This C.D. was only good because it was &quot;new&quot; and it was a time when everyone loved J.Lo. Now I believe people have had enough of her and Ben, but I digress...<BR>This isn't worth your time. Listening to it gives me a headache, and you easily outgrow these songs. Go away J.LO, go far away.
B00005JMFI|4.0|After seeing the preview, I decided to take my kids to go see it with me.  It had some cute funny parts and even a few silly parts that children could relate to.  My son (7 yr old) really liked it!  Myself, who is Will Farrell fan (and liked SNL a lot better when he was still on the show), also liked this movie.  But, at times, it seemed a little never-ending.  It at times, seemed like a drawn-out SNL skit gone boring!<br />But overall, It was a good movie for children and SNL fans.  And if you do not fall in that category, wait until it comes out to video, or wait until it goes to one of those cheap theaters!
B00005JMFR|4.0|I'm a devoted fan of the Matrix and I was very exicited for the release of the concluding Revolutions sequel. The movie brings together the entire cast and utilizes teamwork in the epic battle to save Xion and its people from complete destruction from the machines. The plot is once again in full throttle with new twists and turns and eye-boggling special effects. Certain disappointments such as the death of one of the main characters (I won't mention the name so it doesn't spoil the movie) is used for emotional relief, similar to the approach used in Star Trek: Nemesis when Data died. Much goes un-answered throughout the film such as who this large orb with spikes coming out of it is, and if Neo actually survives all remains an enigma. I feel obligated to reveal a primary part of the plot to people pondering on whether it's worth to see it in the theater. Instead of giving the audience what they expected- the end of the war and the end of the machines' rule over humans, we get a lame \\"Peace\\" status to be maintained between the machines and humans. The ending is an insult to the devoted fans that anticipated the final defeat of the machines and for humans to take back control of Earth. One might cite from the Anti-matrix that we in fact struck first on the machines and never gave them a chance to have even when they wanted peace. However, AI was a mistake and the machines went too far and striking back was only logical. It's ironic that peace was finally obtained after so many had to die/be enslaved and the Earth had to be scorched.  In conclusion, the film is definitely worth seeing, but beware you may feel distraught after viewing the ending.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|It started with a sad beginning, to the point that I was getting a little choked up. It had some cute and funny parts. It really<br />was geared towards children in all means! A lot of people say it is better than Toy Story. I'm sorry, but I disagree! Yes, the computer animation was great and storyline, as well; However, it would have to be a more funny and entertaining to beat my rating on Toy Story or Toy Story 2. And the Toy Story's had some adult humor in them, which Finding Nemo lacks.<br />My 7 year old son enjoyed the film, but he agreed that Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were better. My 3 year old daughter couldn't sit still, it didn't keep her attention (which Jungle Book 2, both Toy Storys, Cinderella, all kept her glued to the screen).<br />They both want the DVD for Christmas, which I've already bought and it has some good special features. And maybe you'll agree with a lot of the other viewers, by giving it 5-stars and saying it was the best Disney feature. But, I am sticking with the Toy Storys' to be considered the best films! ENJOY!
B00005JM0B|5.0|Wow!  I really liked this film!  It was action-packed and had some special effects.  The DVD is full of extra and special features along with the great feature film!  Although, Arnold Schwartzinegger only has a few lines, it still managed to be a breakthrough film!<br />If you like 1 & 2 - you will love T-3!  It is definately NOT suitable for any children!  There are even some spooky parts, that gave me the shivers!  So please do not let any children under 13 watch it either!  Because It may follow waking nights with nightmares!<br />I recommend this movie to any adult that likes action films, even if you're not an Arnold fan!
B000092Q4U|5.0|I freakin love this cd!!! its just as, or maybe better than their first cd An American Gospel. <br />I cant wait to see them this month!!!! Playin with shadows fall..killswitch engage...and unearth...oh yea baby!!!!! hehehe
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Most of the reviewers seem to be disappointed with this cd. The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Standout tracks are fallen, world on fire, stupid, drifting, and answer.  5 out of 10 are really good songs. Honorable mention to dirty little secret. A lot of reviewers are dissing this cd because it is only 40 minutes long.  Surfacing was only 40 minutes long and only had 10 songs...and it was released 4 years after Fumbling.<BR>I much rather have a 40 minute cd that I don't have to skip around on. All 10 songs have their own strong points. Overall, the cd IS a bit more mellow but that's what Sarah is known for.  Give it another chance. It deserves it.
B00005JMFR|4.0|When I finally went to the theater I was ready to be at the edge of my seat.  Everything was fine, the story was good.  The battle between man and machine in Zion was very powerful and breath taking. Still, everybody (including me) were thinking about the Neo and Smith fight scene. After the battle scene was over, and after 20 minutes of non stop gun firing, it was time for our kung-fu dose and a surprising ending. That my friends, was very very dissapointing. All I saw from that fight was lots and lots of rain, lots of flying, lots of thunders, and at the end 20 punches and 10 kicks. Its really dissapointing that a scene that took 8 weeks and so much money to be done, could be that low. The effects were great and the movie is not bad, but I think the Wachowski brothers, after the previous films, should have think about a better way to end the movie, and a better final fight scene, wich was very necessary for a Matrix movie.
0385504209|5.0|The real Knights Templars protect a real secret, read a book called &quot;The Hiram Key&quot;.....
B0000C6E4D|1.0|Let me start out with this:<BR>1) I have every Sarah McLachlan album, even the rare limited edition LIVE EP<BR>2) All the singles, even some imports<BR>3) I have waited a long time for this album<BR>4) I am a Sarah fan(atic), and I can quit whenever I want :)<BR>5) Tried really really hard to like this album.  I have been listening to it for almost a week.<br />Why Afterglow sucks....<br />Touch. <br />That's right, it reminds me of Sarah's first album &quot;TOUCH&quot;. It feels very incomplete and random. It starts out with Fallen, which is an orphan on this album. Fallen deserves to be on &quot;Surfacing&quot;. <br />By Sarah standards, Afterglow sucks. There's little emotion in the music and the entire CD is only 40 minutes and 7 seconds.  I feel no beautiful or gracefulness when I listen to this album.  &quot;Solace&quot;, &quot;Fumbing Towards Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Surfacing&quot; were all beautiful and full of emotions.  <br />It lacks even clever lines. Where's the &quot;companion to our demons/they will dance and we will play&quot; or &quot;I would be the one to hold you down/kiss you so hard/I would take your breath away&quot;? Lyrics are so predictable that it could have been taken from the latest teen-pop album. <br />But I'm also a fan of Valen Hsu and Tori Amos. So lyrics is probably not that important for me since I have no clue what either of them are singing.<br />&quot;Who the hell produced this album!!!&quot; was my first thought. It sounds so bad. Unfortunately, seems like Pierre (her long time producer) rushed his job too.  If the lyrics doesn't work then at least make the album sound cool. The music is just boring and repetitive. Her beautiful voice is constantly overwhelmed by the instruments.  She's known for the great clarity of her voice but on Afterglow it's sometimes difficult to hear what she's singing.  <br />What's good?  Fallen and Trainwreck.  Trainwreck sounds good but predictable lyrics. The best is probably the album's title, &quot;Afterglow&quot;. When you can get a &quot;wow, that's a cool title&quot; from a 17-year old teen that's into gangster rap, you have a winning name.<br />Did I buy the album? You bet. I'm still a Sarah fan(atic). And she still has two more albums to screw up before I abandon her.<br />If you don't already own &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,&quot; buy it now.  If you can, find the gold-disc double CD &quot;Fumbling../Freedom Sessions.&quot;
B00005JMFR|4.0|Having just come back from my first viewing of Revolutions, I must say that I am of two minds concerning the movie. Comparison to the other two would seem to say that this is second string to the original, yet still worlds better than the burdening \\"middle child\\" of Reloaded. <br />In general, the Brothers seemed to have become aware of some of the most obvious flaws in Reloaded, while blatantly ignoring others. The dialogue is clean, unburdened with cliches and pseudo-philosophy as it was in Reloaded. Keanu Reeves, while still comparable to a lump of coal in acting talent, seems to have discovered the fact that using emotion in acting is acceptable. Granted, the emotion was childish and poorly done, yet it was a definite improvement. While he cannot convince the audience of his feelings, at least the attempt is made. Carrie Anne-Moss seemed to be less bored with her role in this movie, and there appeared to be a slight glimmer of chemistry between the two actors that was sadly lacking from the first two movies. <br />On to the plot. While the plot for the Matrix was fresh and crisp, and the plot for Reloaded banal and inconclusive, the plot for Revolutions was somwhere inbetween. This movie took on an epic feel that many war movies \\"gun\\" for; whether or not it suceeded is another matter. The opening, while still showing glimpses of the reviled \\"rave orgy\\" and having some of the pointless conversation that gave Reloaded its notoriety, managed not to beat me over the head while still keeping me interested. <br />I would argue that the battle between man and machine inside the Zion docks is one of the best CGI battle sequences of all time. Again, instead of trying to beat viewers over the head with CGI, there is a much better intgeration of modern technology into the movie. This all-out battle was possibly the best part of the movie, and while the rest came close at times, in terms of pure adrenaline rushes, this scene owns the movie.<br />Of course, this is only halfof the story. Neo and Trinity are out to save the world again, and while they may be out to save Zion, they end up destroying the mood of the movie. While the death of Trinity is well written, its length borders on ludicrous, and Reeves attempt at crying, while refreshing, is an utter failure. <br />The final showdown between Smith and Neo is as epic as one could want a battle to be; a titanic clash involving more excellent SFX, though not on a level with the Zion battle. And yet, the last ten minutes nearly destroy the entire film. Smith loses his poise and begins to sound like a patient in a mental health institution, and the Brothers seem to think they need to beat viewers over the head with biblical symbolism at this point. <br />While the eventual resolution of Revolutions is disappointing, the slight aura of mystery that the conclusion provides is welcome, and prevents a Vanilla Sky-like disaster. <br />All in all, a great improvment to Reloaded, yet not an equal to the first. Best put, it was an enjoyable 2 hours, ten destructive minutes, and a slightly better last five minutes. But all in all, a satisfying, if somewhat off-key recovery and resolution to a mixed bag of a trilogy.
B000000H5K|5.0|Okay, I NEVER write reviews for music because you either like it, or you don't. However, This Album is/was so far ahead of it's time that bands are still trying to copy some/all of its elements. Lookaway (track 8) is pure genius; it's so good it hurts.  So do your self a favor, BUY this album, Listen to it on a Hi-end Stereo or good headphones, and see what you have been missing... Nuff' Said
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Rush In Rio doesn't really need any critical assistance.  If you are a long time fan of Rush, you'll love it, warts and all. If you're an audiophile, you'll probably like it less.  That said, this is a great live set from one of rock's greatest bands. The sound quality is not the greatest, the mix is a lot rawer than A Show Of Hands or Different Stages, but the intensity and precision of the performances more than make up for it.  Rush blasts through a wide variety of material from their varied and innovative musical career.  The fact that the CD starts with Tom Sawyer, one of the all-time Rush classics, is proof of the musical depth contained here.  The Vapor Trails material fares very well here, as the rawness of the songs on that recording are better appreciated in a live situation.  Ghost Rider, One Little Victory, Secret Touch, and especially Earthshine feature monstrous performances.  I found it amazing that the Brazilian crowd was singing along with some of the instrumentals. An unplugged version of Resist was an unexpected treat, and Neil Peart once again proves that he is the only drummer capable of making a drum solo interesting.  The band plays with fire and aggression on the older material. La Villa Stratiago is a jaw-dropping tour-de-force as always, I would have preferred an extended acoustic intro, though. Alex Liefson's comic relief was pleasant addition. Who says this band doesn't have a sense of humor? Geddy playing Girl From Ipanema on the bass was especially funny.  Overture, Temples of Syrinx, Working Man, and the intro to Cygnus X-1  rock hard, and if you're disappointed that they didn't play all of 2112 or Cygnus X-1, buy Different Stages.  If you're a true Rush fan, you probably have it already. This is a very good package for the price.  Granted, the sound quality isn't the best, but there is the sense that this is a live recording, and Rush In Rio shows a great band at its peak in an enthusiastic environment.  Ultimately, that's all you canand should expect from a live CD. Rush is a living, breathing, playing reminder of of a time when bands took pride in their ability to pull off their material live, something that has been lost in the crass and ubiquitous commercialism that permeates today's music scene.
B000003S09|5.0|Simply put, one of thee finest debut albums in history. A must have for any prog fans.
B00000JLWW|5.0|And maybe, the best and most underrated of all time. Titanic is a masterpiece of perfectionism with touches of romance, fantasy, and adventure. I'm not sure, but I'll be willing to bet the same amount of controversial praddlings went on about Steven Spielberg's ET when it first came out 11 years ago. But, why did that movie make all the money that it did then? Why only now is it perceived as a children's film (receiving no more 9 million dollars in it's rerelease)? In that case, why is it Titanic made all the money that it did? I can guarantee you all that it wasn't just because of Leonardo DiCaprio. He did a fine, upstanding job, but just look at his recent films. The money they all pulled in, including Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can didn't even come close to compare with the money Titanic pulled in.<br />Cameron used all of his talents, acquired over 14 years of training to make a timeless romance in a backdrop that is chaotic, dark and sad. Yes, we may have seen Rose and Jack's tale before, but never like this. Cameron takes the cliche romance and makes it his own. I'm not saying that it's a better love story than Wuthering Heights, Gone With The Wind or Casablanca. All I'm saying is that Titanic is just as heartfelt and pulls at the heartstrings just like Wuthering Heights. It commands a real life event with its love story as perfectly as Gone With The Wind and Casablanca did, and it has the epic scope GWTW did. But, on its own merit, Titanic does stand on its own as a great historical film that can be enjoyed time and time again.<br />The '90s films were made fools of when Titanic came out. Nothing had broken the record Star Wars set since ET in '82. There is probably a lot of under-handed, misguided jealously that we're not hearing about on the surface, because some of those people had films they loved so much, break even or bomb and never make the same amount of money Titanic made. But, folks, stop being so self-involved, look at Titanic for what it really has to offer. It made 1.8 billion worldwide, took home 11 Oscars with 14 Nominations....I think it deserves our respect, at least.<br />I am not saying Titanic is the &quot;greatest film of all time,&quot; just one of the top ten.
B00008BXJF|3.0|Well, at least the cover has a lot of character, style, and artistic merit. The album lacks distinctiveness, or maybe I'm just expecting KC to scale previous heights. Better than most albums out there, however below the standard of Lark's, Starless, or Red.
B0000DI7UR|3.0|I'll be honest, if it wasn't for Stratovarius and my friend introducing me to their music about two years ago, I would probably still be listening to the crap some people call music in this country.<br />But after pracrically listing to almost everything that the band has to offer, and what other metal bands have and are pumping out nowadays, Stratovarius is, a least to me, losing some of it luster. Don't get me wrong, I am still a fan and always will be, and Stratovarius is a great band, but I can't help but feel they are a little overrated by people, kinda like how Rhapsody is at times...<br />Now about the new album. After the first Elements, I was contented, it was a good album, with a great balance of speed, mid-tempo, slow, and epic songs. Everything was is in its correct place and all was right with the world.<br />But after listening to Elements Pt.2, I can't shake this feeling of how \\"unbalanced\\" this CD really is. In essence, you have three really fast, catchy songs, and you have six mid-tempo/slow/ballad songs that you can't really bang your head to. I mean, the songs are good, Stratovarius seal of quality, but I just cannot sink my teeth and chew into it's heavy-metal goodness. One reason it may seem this way is technically no epic on this cd (but it was on the last one). Another reason may be that the instumental is also on the first CD is well, making the variety here somewhat slim. <br />All and all, I still glad I grabbed up this CD, but it doesn't really hold a special place in my heart like Dreamspace, Twilight Time, and Elements Pt.1 does.<br />However, since early 2002 the band has really been encountered  a lot of difficulties and rumors fly abound, and this is why I may feel the way I feel. I always though of Stratovarius as a well oiled metal machine, and maybe these recent rumors have damaged this view of mine. Oh well, we are at least going to see three more Stratovarius releases before the band is done, due to their recent contract signingwith Sancuary records, so I should quit complaining.<br />In closing, buy it your a fan, but start with a different Stratovarius release if your new to the band (Dreamspace, Episode, Visions, Destiny, Infinte, or Element's Pt.1).<br />-Added Nov. 24 2003-<br />Guess all of us fans of Stratovarius worst nightmares have come true. A recent news post by Tolkki at [...] has informed us that some of these rurmors are not rumors, but indeed truth. Tolkki plans to keep the band going, and possible line-up changes are inevitable.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Terminator 3 was the second best in the Trilogy. I like it alot. The movie was non-stop action. The end was great. &quot;She'll be back&quot;.Arnold is the best action star ever.
B00008NRL8|5.0|Lovely music! <BR>Bonus songs are kind of boring.<BR>But the album is a must for any eclectic music listener.
B00000099Y|5.0|There are many things that make a great/brilliant album. This album has it all. I can be dull and tell you what this album has, but that still won't do it justice. this is one of the most rewarding albums i have ever listened to. the structure, atmosphere, music . . . . yes music, are/is absolutly pretty. pretty???? you might say, but the way it makes you feel is a good thing. Listen and see. danny carey is the best drummer since my late mate. (bonzo)
B00008J4P5|4.0|I'm really surprised by how many people have posted poor reviews for a good band. I can understand if it's not your taste but there is no way this album is boring. I'm also tired of people saying they've ripped off other bands, EVERY BAND HAS RIPPED OFF ANOTHER BAND. Of course they're going to use forms and styles they like of other bands. Anyway, this is one of my favorite bands with a great sound. My favorite songs are &quot;Black Math&quot;, &quot;I Just Don't What To Do With Myself&quot;, and &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;. I usually skip &quot;In The Cold, Cold Night&quot; (no offense to Meg) &amp; &quot;Well It's True That We Love Another&quot; Good album along with De Stijl.
0517548232|5.0|&quot;The whole of economics... can be reduced to a single sentence. The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.&quot;<br />So begins the brilliant and controversial work of Henry Hazlitt. As it is not the purpose of this forum to debate economic theory, let me simply suggest that you obtain this book and draw your own conclusions from it. The richer understanding of trade policy, taxes and tariffs, and government regulation you will obtain from spending a lazy afternoon with this book will provide more long-term value than its price... in short, buying Economics in One Lesson is sound fiscal policy.
B00005JLSE|3.0|The music was not the best but the story was good. It seems to reflect a lot about our society of present time.
B00005JMFR|4.0|A film like The Matrix Revolutions is a hard movie. The expectations for a movie of it's caliber are set so high anything less than perfection is considered a failure. I think Revolutions really fits in the category well.<br />The Matrix Revolutions is the continuing tail of Neo. He is the One: The Messiah. The one person that can stop the war against the machines. The machines have almost reached Zion and Smith is out of control in the matrix. Will the people of Zion be able to hold off the machines in enough time for Neo to stop Smith and stop the machines. You'll just have to watch the movie to find all that out. I don't really want to say much, because I think it's inconsiderate to say to much of the plot.<br />The film is fantastic eye candy. It doesn't really get old at all seeing all the bullet time and kung fu action. The fight between Smith and Neo is awesome. All the flying and in the rain. It really is quite dramatic. The special effects should clean the Oscars out this year. The only movie that has a prayer shot of topping it is The Return of the King, which so far looks impressive. It really is a two way race with King and Matrix for the special effects Oscar.<br />I thought Keanu Reeves did a fantastic job. It's not an easy role and like I said earlier, expectations are set so high. I'm glad this trilogy has made him an A list star again. I'm impressed to see a star of his stature do his stunts and learn the martial arts. It shows his skill as an actor and I hope the acadamey recognizes it.<br />Hugo Weaving is great. I never get tired of hearing him say, \\"Mr. Anderrson.\\" It makes the hair on your neck stand up. I really thought he was the best part of the movie. He left me lauging a lot when he'd go off on some of his rants.<br />I was disappointed with what they did with Persephone. You see her in Reloaded and the way she's blown up in trailers and reports you'd think Monica Bellucci had a big role in the film. She is a beautiful woman and is easilythe best eye candy in the film. I just think it's a shame to promote her so much and then not use her that much.<br />I liked the film except for the ending. If you've seen the other two films you have to see Revolutions. It truly is a great science fiction trilogy. The Matrix is still the best out of the three. Revolutions was a good endingto the trilogy. Like I said I didn't like the ending that much, but I knew it was going to happen. It left me with a bad feeling in my gut and a bitter taste in my mouth. I was entertained and I will definetly see this movie again. It's a must for Matrix and Sci-Fi fans. It's a great film if you don't knick pick it's flaws. Don't miss out on it.
0671027344|5.0|&quot;the perks of being a wallflower&quot; by Stephen Chbosky is made up of letters that a boy his freshman year of high school writes to a stranger that does not know him. Throughout the book you learn everything about Charlie's life and all the troubles he goes through and how he handles them. Charlie has many hard situations that occur to him, but by the end of the book he realizes that everyone has troubles and that no matter how big or small those troubles may be they are still a persons troubles.<BR>     Charlie starts of with his letters when his only friend commits suicide and continues on throughout his freshman year. He tells of how his Advanced English Teacher, Bill, gives him extra books to read and eventually he finds out why, because Bill thinks he is \\"special\\". He talks about how he makes friends and they are all seniors. He writes about everything he does with them and how sad he is when they graduate. He tells of his first relationship with a girl and how the one girl he really is in love with he cannot have. <BR>     The author, Stephen Chbosky, wrote this book in the only way I see possible. He wrote from Charlie's point of view; everything he was feeling and how little things affected him. Chbosky never tried to hide any of Charlie's feelings from the readers, he treated Charlie like he was a person that was having a conversation with him and he was taking down everything he was saying. Chbosky portrays Charlie perfectly in the way he wrote this book. <BR>     \\"the perks of being a wallflower\\" speaks for itself. The title alone tells you what the book is about. I myself being a \\"wallflower\\" know there are perks to being one. Charlie learns this throughout his letters he writes. Charlie's story teaches readers a lesson, whether or not they know it or think it would. Charlie learns that yes he has problems and he knows that people in the world have a lot worse problems than he does, but he knows that he needs to deal with his problems before he needs to think about other people's problems. I agree with that. Every person needs to take care of him or herself before they can actually help someone else without making him or herself feel worse. <BR>     Charlie's story speaks to anyone who has felt left out of a group of friends or has just not had many friends. Charlie grows a lot throughout the book and while he is learning a life lesson the reader is learning a life lesson also. The lesson from this story is to be true to you, take care of yourself first, and then worry about things that are affecting other people.
B0000039PW|5.0|This album is a classic, a must-have.  He is one of the first hip hop artists and his work is amazing. He's real, and there's no frills behind his music, just real, rugged hip hop at it's finest. Not only is he the best rapper of all time, but this is by far his best album.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm sure there are people who don't know what to make of this album. At first, I didn't. I was used to Radiohead albums throwing curveballs (each and every one since Pablo Honey has). Please open your minds, ladies and gentlemen, because here they do it from SONG TO SONG. Just when you think you're hearing another Kid A or Amnesiac electronic-fest, Sail to the Moon will move you with it's simplistic melancholy piano line, or There There will rock out with its distorted guitars. There are elements of their past music (alternative rock, the epic spacey sounds of OK Computer, the effect-laden madness of their last two albums)in basically every song and at the same time they create something that sounds so new and fresh that it will take several listens to comprehend and, eventually, love. Anyone who loves Radiohead or experimental rock will swear by this CD in time. If you're not a fan of Radiohead yet, better hop on now because Hail to the Thief prove they're not going anywhere, and are still getting better.
B00003CXI1|4.0|While making any movie based on a popular book (Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings), the movie makers have a major conflict on their hands: should they remain loyal to the fans, and make a movie which is almost identical to the book, or try and adapt it as much as possible to the screen, and make it more available for the general crowd, even though this might require compromises to the original story.<br />LOTR's crew has decided to go with the later - changing the facts of the story, while keeping its spirit. This has made some of the more dedicated fans angry, but has exposed many non - fans to the story. Harry Potter 1, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have decided between the options - some parts of the story were cut for timing or because of their small significance, but nothing was added or changed to clarify the story to the non fans. So the fans weren't happy with the cuts, but anyone else could never understand the story without reading the book first.<br />Another problem with this DVD set is the fact the the special features revolve around games, as if someone forgot that many grownups are also fans of the film.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's first album was pretty much generic 90s alt. rock/grunge. They had a hit with Creep, but soon we'd all find out there was more to this band. That happened with The Bends. This album is still under a more basic rock format than their future albums, but is still incredible. Planet Telex is freaky sounding and is a great way to open the album as it goes into the rave-up, isolationist title track. There are several types of songs here. Fake Plastic Trees and High And Dry are absolutely beautiful, based on a simple acoustic guitar and Thom's amazing vocals before building to crescendos. Just and My Iron Lung are examples of electric guitar driven madness that somehow ends up sounding just as moving as the other songs. Then there are songs like Street Spirit, which there are just no words for, you simply have to hear them. Basically if you like rock music (or just WELL-DONE music) you will grow to love this album and, as it did for me, it will open you a door to a whole new world of genius that begins with Radiohead's next album, OK Computer. But if you're new to Radiohead I reccomend starting here, with a classic album in its own right.
B00005JKC3|2.0|The Hulk is a movie with dynamic special effects and far too much drama.  This story steered too far away from the Hulk's original origin in order for me to enjoy it.  No Rick Jones, no gamma bomb explosion.  Sorry the original would have worked much better.  Not all of this hub bub with his dad.<br />This film was marketed as an action film, and what it really is, is over an hour of drama, and about 30 minutes of action.  Sorry this didn't work for me.<br />The pros:<br />1) The special effects and actions is top notch.  <br />2) The scenes with the Hulk were fantastic. (there just not enough of them).<br />3) Sam Elliott and Jennifer Connelly did the best they could with the poor script.<br />The cons....<br />1) struggling through all the drama to see the hulk for the first time. <br />2) Bad story<br />3) where is the hulk?  is this movie called Hulk or life with the Banner's?<br />4) some scenes were filmed so dark, it was hard to tell what was going on. (aka Hulk/ gamma dog fight scenes)<br />Overall, the best reason to buy this DVD is you can go to the track selection and watch the great Hulk scenes, without having to struggle through all the other nonsense.  This movie does not compare to Spiderman, Xmen 1 or 2, Batman, or Superman.  As a whole, Daredevil was more enjoyable than this.<br />Buy at your own risk!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Nothing I had ever heard could have prepared me for OK Computer. Halfway through the opener \\"Airbag\\" you can tell that this is something special. They combine art, rock, and imagery like noone else to paint a bleak canvas, a picture of a civilization overrun with inhumanity, but you can't help but love it. Sure, it SOUNDS at first like rock music, but listen deeper; the treatments on the guitars, the effects, the song structures, the flow, the amazing vocals, the way (at times)those vocals are layered, everything about this album makes it unique. Words can hardly desribe the experience of listening to OK Computer, an activity in and of itself: you have to focus on the music 100%, it forces you to. Even if you don't take the album as a whole, songs like Paranoid Android and Karma Police (the two singles off the album) are revolutionary. Let Down never ceases to move me, it is possibly my favorite song ever. I've said enough, if you want to be enlightened GET THIS ALBUM and feel the awe.
0393057658|5.0|This book is very well written, it's an excellent, refreshing book on the inside workings of managing the drafting, signing and paying players. Billy Beane has turned the GM job into an art form. He has made trades, analyzed and critiqued them, and showed up other GMs. If I were another GM, and I saw Beane coming towards me, I'd cross the street. His approach is unique and amazing. Great title, and it's appropriate.
0060264306|4.0|This is the first book in the \\"Little House\\" series.  It is a little boring compared to the next 2 books but it is fun meeting Laura and her family.  You see the world in the eyes of a five-year-old.  It is a snuggly world.  She plays with big sister Mary(6), cousins come on Christmas, and they go to a dance at grandma's where they meet many, many relatives.  One cousin is another little girl named Laura Ingalls!  The two fight over who's baby sister is cutest.  Some chapters seem to be long decriptions of how to make things like shelves and bullets for the rifle.  If you're not interested in these things, it might get a little boring at this point.  Hang in there, because Laura is adorable, and you're only five once!<br />Get to know them now, because the adventures continue in the next book, and the next book.  Everyone is growing up, don't miss their precious childhood!  Sometimes I wish they never moved out of their little house in the big woods.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|My hubby and I saw Finding Nemo on a date night. He's not the animation type but let me pick the movie. I absolutely loved it! It was a fun movie. And the animation was absolutley amazing! I thought the movie was so GREAT that I preordered it from Amazon because I thought it would sell out overnight when released in the stores. Well it didn't. But I don't care. It's worth the wait! And will make a perfect stocking stuffer for me!
B000003TA4|1.0|Nevermind's phenominal success was a fluke; Nirvana just hit at the right time. It boggles the mind how anyone could consider this album great. It's so simplistic to the point it's juvenile. And no, I don't mean &quot;simplistic&quot; in terms of &quot;sparse beauty&quot;, I mean that it's just a repetitive bore-fest. After the obligatory guitar solo, I switched to the next track on the CD because all Cobain does after it is lazily repeat the chorus ten more times. If Cobain didn't have that slight stubble and those baby-faced good looks, you'd all have forgotten about him by now. We all know he felt guilty about how he wasn't exactly ugly. Admit it. His good looks DID lend to his wronful status as legend. Give muddy Banks to any non-Nirvana fan and tell them Kurt's a legend. You'll get laughed off the jungle gym.
B00005JMFR|1.0|The Matrix Revolutions was the worst movie ever.  Anyone but the most die hard Matrix fan will agree that this movie totally blew.  I just want to know who wrote the dialogue for this movie.  I feel that a room full of monkeys could definately have come up with a more polished script.
0618154043|3.0|This book, in my opinion, is just a continuance of The Silmarillion, with some added commentary from Christopher Tolkien.  It is, as the title claims, unfinished and previously unpublished works of Tolkien's now combined in a single collection.  I found that I could never keep my place--I constantly had to flip back and read over things again because I either missed them, or just plain didn't understand them the first time.  There also was a lack of general plot structure.  Each individual story had its own plot, of course, but the book as a whole was lacking transition.  Starting a new chapter was like starting a new book.  I was also frustrated by Chris Tolkien's commentary at the end of every section.  It ruined the whole grace and finesse of a well-crafted piece of literature.  On the whole, however, the book did an excellent job tying up some loose ends left for you in The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings.  It went into more depth about the origin of Aragorn's people (though not actually mentioned as Aragorn's ancestors, they are as such); where the wizards Gandalf and Saruman came from and WHY they came; as well as a greater look into the War of the Ring. <BR>I rate Unfinished Tales as a 3-star work because my feelings on it are neither good nor bad. The layout and general plot structure was a disaster, but the basic principle of the stories told within were excellent fillers.  Overall, though this book did not thrill me, it is a must-have for any diehard Tolkien fan and a great help answering any &quot;why?&quot; question you may have regarding the nuances and details of The Lord of the Rings.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|This CD is missing something...&quot;Fallen&quot; is excellent.  However, all of the other songs on the album end up sounding the same or reminding me of her past songs.  After years of waiting, I'm not floored with this release, as I was hoping I would be...but despite its faults, I do appreciate it...One thing's for certain, it's better than anything out there right now...but not SM's best.
B000002GQE|5.0|This is the hallmark recording that started the Moody Blues on their sojourn and it is a remarkable one at that. This grouping brought in John Lodge and Justin Hayward maximizing the songwriting and five-way vocal harmonizing that is so well known now. Although the symphonic arrangments may sound slightly dated, it is still a 'mood-piece' to wash away your worries and dive into your dreams. &quot;Night In White Satin&quot; was released in 1967 and 1971 as a single, so strong is it's appeal. The other songs display how talented and unafraid these musicians were to experiment, bringing classical pop into the rock arena.<br />The impact of this album is immense, setting the standard for the then used 'mellotron', virtually introduced to rock music by Mike Pinder. Justin Hayward and John Lodge's songwriting abilities proved them premature geniuses, Ray Thomas proved the flute can be used in rock 'n roll and Graeme Edge was one of the first to use spoken word - far before 'rap'.<br />The premise is pure genius, taking basic ballads, amplifying the emotional vocals and tying it all together under an immense orchestration. This must have been the first rock concept album. It survives today. Whether digitally remastered, GOLD or DTS, you cannot go wrong.
B00005JMFR|1.0|-I Don't reccomend reading if you haven't seen the movie-<br />I went and saw the movie yesterday, and I should've known something was up with the theatre being just maybe slightly more than half full on premiere day. The hype, the exciting aura, and the crazed fans just weren't there. Maybe it's the product of the Wachowski's trying to cram the release of 2 of the most anticipated sequels within 6 months of each other, something I have never heard of. As far as the movie goes, I think the \\"RickyMartin\\" reveiwer earlier couldn't have said it better, \\"How could something that started so good, end up so bad?\\" Each movie has been successively worse than the last. No one else pointed it out, but the whole oracle thing just really blew it for me, but then again you can't really blame the bro's and there is really nothing they could've done about it, being that the original had died. You just can't match the original oracle, just something about her made her perfect for the part. The acting in the movie sucked, almost laughable at points, and the ending sucked. Did anyone get a kick out of the atari-like turret gun controls in the ship as they are racing back to the Zion docks while shooting the sentinels? And a la contrare to what everyone though, I thought the Neo/Smith fight at the end was not all that great, I like the rain setting, and all the smiths standing around, but when it becomes airborne it starts to get a little lame. Anyway I could go on and on but all in all it was a letdown, not quite what I was expecting to leave me content.
B00005JM02|4.0|Finding Nemo is a good movie with super production and great Disney themes: family, paternal instincts, friendship, loyalty, and the parent-child conflict dynamic of protecting the child versus the ability to let go and let the progeny do things on his/her own.  For those who don't know: Marlin and Coral are clownfish who produced a school's worth of eggs but Coral and all but one of the eggs are eaten by a barracuda in the first minutes of the film (scary for little ones).  Nemo is the sole survivor and grows up with his overprotective dad Marlin.  On his first day of educational school, Nemo is captured by a diver for his dental office's saltwater fish collection and Marlin overcomes his fears of open water to swim through the whole coast of Australia to find Nemo, aided by Dory the nutty blue tang who tracked the path of the dentist's boat.<br />The movie is not as funny as most of the other Pixars, though it has its moments: the Fisheaters Anonymous meetings for sharks, some of Ellen DeGeneres' scene-stealers as Dory the forgetful blue tang, the goofy fish Nemo meets in the dentist's tank who provide color commentary for dental procedures.<BR>The movie is also more poignant than the other Pixars.  And you're guaranteed never to look at fish in fishtanks the same way again.<br />As a DVD, the extras are not very good.  There are &quot;deleted scenes&quot; but they were deleted at the storyboarding stage of production, so they did not get the full Pixar compu-graphic workup and are instead crude drawings with proto-type voiceovers [Pixar does an initial voice-over of the script with in-house production crew members providing the voices, then brings in the high-priced talent like DeGeneres, Albert Brooks [Marlin], Geoffrey Rush, Willem Dafoe, etc.; sometimes Pixar folks' work remains in the movie such as Crush the surfer-dude turtle in this flik, and Heimlich the fat caterpillar from A Bug's Life].  There are also some educational bits that are interesting.<br />But the character interviews with Dory, Marlin and Nemo are not particularly humorous or well-written, they just magnify the characters' more noted traits.  Worst of all, there is NO BLOOPER SET -- the best feature of the other Pixar films (they're so popular that Monsters, Inc. had TWO Blooper sets).  That is a true loss.
B00005JMFR|5.0|THIS MAY GO DOWN AS THE BEST TRILOGY SET EVER MADE IN THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THIS MOVIE WAS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN MATRIX ANDMATRIX 2, IT HAD SO MUCH ACTION IT WUZ NOT EVEN FUNNY. THE WAR SCENE WAS UNBELIVABLE, JUST CAUGHT MY EYES IN SUSPENSE, THE TALKING IS PERFECT, NOT TO MUCH, NOT TO LITTLE. EVERYTHING WSS PERFECT, THE FIGHT SCENE WITH NEO AND SMITH, CRZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!, I LOVED IT ALL, AND I HAVE THE FIRST 2, I CANT WAIT FOR THIS ONE , JUST AN AMAZING MOVIE, 5 STARS
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I'm afraid I'll have to echo the sentiments of many people here. I own pretty much everything that Sarah has put out... the B-sides, Remixes, etc...<br />The impact her music has had on my life has been rather profound. She introuduced me to music. But this isn't her best album. And at first it's hard to finger exactly why. Overall, it sounds very much like Sarah. The sound is the same. And this, I don't mind. I don't want her to suddenly put out a punk album or anything.<br />But the truth is, with rare exceptions, too much of this album fades into the background on the first listen. It takes repeated listens to really appreciate this album. And that's not really a bad thing. Some albums are just slow burners. But even though I can listen to this album, appreciate it, and confidently say that it's better then a lot of music out there... there are some major flaws.<br />The standout tracks are most assuredly the three touted on the sticker on the front, &quot;Fallen,&quot; &quot;Stupid,&quot; and &quot;World of Fire.&quot;<br />I think &quot;Stupid&quot; in particular is very effective. Probably one of my favorite Sarah songs ever. Honarable mention goes to &quot;Drifting&quot; as well.<br />But that's the first 4 tracks folks, and there's still six more to go. The problem is, even in the good songs Sarah suffers &quot;Jewel Syndrome&quot; and gets caught up in metaphors and images that she's already used quite a bit (&quot;World on Fire&quot; being a similar sentiment to the one expressed in &quot;Witness&quot; from Surfacing), or that have been used so heavily that they just aren't particularly interesting (see<br />Trainwreck&quot;). There's a fine line between simplicity in lyrics and laziness in songwriting. I think that Sarah treads safely on the side of the former... but just barely.<br />Some of the songs just seem to go nowhere, especially Push. The song flutters in very beautifully, says the same things over and over and then flutters out, leaving us with nothing but a passing impression and a fistful of cliche phrases like &quot;You pick me up and brush me off and tell me I'm okay, sometimes that's just what we need to get us through the day, you stay the course, you hold the line, you keep it all together&quot;... etc.<br />I can latch on to the emotions in songs like Answer or Time or Push or Fallen. But overall the album is just so quiet... and trudges along at more or less the same pace. It's a lovely pace, no doubt... but I wanted the album to demand my attention more. I want to be engaged like I was with the haunting phrase &quot;Listen as the wind blows across the great divide.&quot;<br />And it never comes, besides the exceptions I noted before. I feel like Sarah's really expressing something here... I just wish she or the music would kick it out a bit more.<br />But you can't have everything in one album. I think the long wait between albums built up expectations a bit more. If this had come out two years after Surfacing (or even Mirrorball) and we were getting another album now, it wouldn't have been so bad. But life happened, and you can't hold that against her. This album simply is what it is.<br />I've missed Sarah quite a bit, and this just isn't the homerun I was expecting. Still, it's no foul either. It's a beautiful, relaxed album. And some of the songs have really hit home with me, and I encourage everyone to buy it. It just won't be counted among my favorite Sarah albums.nothing but a passing impression and a fistful of cliche phrases like &quot;You pick me up and brush me off and tell me I'm okay, sometimes that's just what we need to get us through the day, you stay the course, you hold the line, you keep it all together&quot;... etc.<br />I can latch on to the emotions in songs like Answer or Time or Push or Fallen.

B000006NXP|3.0|If, as everyone seems to concur, that Brahms 4th is `tragic', then Szell's - not Kleiber's - reading fits the tragic mould to a T. Szell takes a restrained, steady pace, complementing the stately lyricism of the work. Passion? Intensity? Noble vehemence? Analytical sobriety? Szell delivers them in spades. No other conductor articulates the jagged second theme or hammers the final, perorating bars of the  Allegro non troppo as  forthrightly as Szell, and the measured pace he gives the symphony highlights its baroque textures as well as the `inner voices' of the violas and the woodwinds.  Compared to the glassy recording of the Kleiber, Szell's analog transfer is warm and transparent, perfect for the Clevelanders' glorious phrasing. All faults considered, Szell's recording, for its rhythmic solidity (if stolidity), is revelatory; Kleiber rushes us about and makes us mistake the forest for the trees. I have to admit, however, that I prefer his reading of the two inner movements to that of Szell, who makes the scherzo lumber ponderously when it should blithely and lithely jubilate.<br />But let us go to the crowning glory of the work: the allegro energico. A commentator once said that the final movement of Brahms's last symphony was where the composer bended his knees to the eternal. Szell takes this view and, harping on the grim hammerblows of the first movement, rounds off the symphony's peroratio, leading it to a contrapuntally exhilarating, step-like descent to its minor key affirmation. In this regard, I hardly see Kleiber's reading of the chaconne as tragic, what with the bouncy dance tempo he takes in the close (a happy-ending sop to the gallery, perhaps?). Buy the Kleiber if you must: it's champagne to Szell's cold, clear water. This, my dear waltz-drunk friends, is the real, `tragic' approach to a what many insist is Brahms' `tragic' symphony.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This album is a HUGE improvement from oops! i did it again.  It's only a little worse than her debut album, Hit me baby one more time, which she made when she was 17.  BRITNEY is her third album, and actually quite good, her voice has gotten so much better...here is a review of the songs:<BR>1. I'm A Slave 4 U-Best first single shes ever realeased. Not awesome though 4/5  <BR>2. Overprotected-Really great message and just plain great 5/5  <BR>3. Lonely-For some reason it reminds me of the book The Bad Beggining by Lemony Snicket...but it's a really good song 6/5  <BR>4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (Featured In &quot;Crossroads&quot;)-Her ballad, the 3rd best ballad shes ever realeased besides broken heart and when ur eyes say it 5/5  <BR>5. Boys-O la la! I luv this song, the best one on the album! Very good. 5/5  <BR>6. Anticipating-It's not as good as Boys, not very good actually. 2.5/5        <BR>7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll-This is her best remake yet, plus i love the Ows! even if they sound weak. 4/5<br />8. Cinderella-It's OK 3/5        <BR>9. Let Me Be-Really cool! I love the lyrics! 5/5        <BR>10. Bombastic Love-It's OK 3.5/5        <BR>11. That's Where You Take Me-NOT her best ballad ever. Ugh yuck i hate this song. 1/5        <BR>12. What It's Like To Be Me-It's OK 3/5<BR>OVERALL: 4/5
B000006NXP|3.0|If, as everyone seems to concur, that Brahms 4th is `tragic', then Szell's - not Kleiber's - conducting fits the bill. Szell takes a restrained, steady pace, although this rarely diminishes the lyricism of the work. Passion? Intensity? Noble outburst? No other conductor articulates the jagged second theme or hammers the final, perorating bars of the  Allegro non troppo as convincingly or forthrightly as Szell, and the measured pace he takes in the symphony highlights the chaconne's baroque textures as well as orchestral inner voices such as the violas and the woodwinds.  Compared to the glassy recording of the Kleiber, Szell's analogue transfer is warm and transparent, perfect for the Clevelanders' glorious articulation. All faults considered, Szell's recording, for its rhythmic solidity (or stolidity), is revelatory; Kleiber rushes us about and makes us mistake the forest for the trees. I have to admit, however, that I prefer his reading of the two inner movements to Szell's.<br />But let us go to the crowning glory of this work: the allegro energico. A critic once said that the final bars of Brahms's last symphony was where the composer bended his knees to the divine. Szell takes this view and, harping on the grim hammerblows of the first movement, rounds off the symphony's peroration, leading it to a contrapuntally exhilarating, step-like descent to its minor key conclusion. In this regard, I hardly see Kleiber's reading of the chaconne as tragic, what with the bouncy dance tempo he takes in the close (a happy-ending sop to the gallery, perhaps?).

0192833588|5.0|Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811.  It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles.  Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel.  Austen is a romantic writer.  In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.<br /> In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel.  In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood.  Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy.  While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town.  Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother.  Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies.  Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her.  The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.<br /> The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility.  Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility.  She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest.  Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life.  This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.<br /> In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them.  We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships.  People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel.  Marianne acts like a typical adolescent.  She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.<br /> The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts.  Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period.  She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death.  Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time.
B0000CABBW|5.0|\\"Whale Rider\\" is a remarkable and exquisite movie from New Zealand. Disregard the MPAA's clueless \\"PG-13\\" rating. This film is suitable for viewers aged ten to a hundred. And, for once, we have a movie which lifts one's spirits - indeed, makes them soar - without resorting to gross sentimentality, banal, manipulative dialog or predictable plot turns. <br />This is the story of a young girl, Paikea [Keisha Castle-Hughes]. and her family, all of whom are part of the Maori population in New Zealand. The Maori were the original settlers of the island. They arrived many hundreds of years before the British, and in the remote part of the country where Paikea lives, they have retained much of their culture. One of their legends is that the original chief arrived in New Zealand on the back of a whale. <br />Paikea is born in tragedy. Her mother dies in childbirth, and her twin brother is stillborn. Her grandfather, Koro [Rawiri Paratene], is a local Maori chief who begs the baby's father, Poro [Cliff Curtis], to start another family as soon as possible, but the heartbroken Poro decides to leave the country and pursue his ambitions as an artist. This leaves Koro and his wife, Flower [Vicky Haugton], to raise Paikea. <br />The movie moves quickly forward to Paikea at age twelve. It is obvious that the girl and her grandfather have closely bonded. Their rift is simple: Koro can not accept the idea that a girl could ever be a Maori chief, but Paikea otherwise embodies everything that is Maori. She is almost literally the whale rider reborn.<br />Castle-Hughes is the center of the movie, and she is, as other critics have noted, a star in the making. I have not seen a child carry a movie as well as she does since Haley Joel Osment in \\"The Sixth Sense\\". Hers is a stunning performance, and one can only hope that she can build from this role, as opposed to being defined by it.<br />The photography is magnificent, as is the music score. All of the movie's elements work together to produce a work that is both magical and meaningful.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I made the mistake of thinking that this movie would be cerebral and complex similar to the British-made movie, Enigma.  I looked forward to seeing the Navajo star in a story about their skills as Code Talkers, and how they were able to outwit the Japanese and win battles for the Americans.  Wow, what a disappointment.  Instead, I saw a movie that simply used a few Navajo as excuses to show madness and mayhem on a grand scale.  After sitting through the first half hour and being regularly bombarded with the cinematic equivalent of humans being fed through a meat grinder, I started to fast forward through the battle scenes,  looking for those all too brief moments of conversation which only amounted to Nicholas Cage working through  his own issues, over and over and over, ad nauseum.  And if his eventual demise is just payment for his past decisions, I think we would all be better off not being acquainted with this wreck of a human being.  Why the producers decided to misname the movie &quot;Windtalkers&quot; is a mystery.  Frankly, the Native Americans who served this country during WWII deserve to have their story told, but this was definitely not the vehicle.  See this movie only if you have a perverse desire to see humans ripped to shreds in a gratuitous display of senseless violence that repeats itself every five to ten minutes throughout the movie. My final word:  Yuck.
B000002NIW|5.0|Rock albums. There are tons of them. Metal, punk, hardcore, pick your genre. In the piles and piles of albums that lurk in CD stores everywhere are bands that exist only to fill gaps on radio or be used as tax right-offs by major record labels. But every once in a while, when the moon is right, and the crows caw, and the dogs howl in unison at midnight...an album is born. An album that doesn't just regurgitate the current state of music. An album that stands alone; an album SO good it DEFINES a genre. This my friends is THE DEFINITION of &quot;Around the Fur.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, &quot;White Pony&quot; seems to get most of the recognition for turning the metal scene on its ear...a credit that should have begun with THIS album. <br />From Thursday, to Glassjaw, to The Used, to Finch, even Thrice and countless others...the Deftones' influence is unmistakable. This is not to say that The Deftones don't have their own influences, there are some &quot;Helmet&quot; fingerprints all over this album. But unlike bands of similar ilk I have ripped on this website, the Deftones took what they liked and made it theirs. This album is the BIG difference between influence and imitation. <br />I will issue this disclaimer: if you do not like metal or screaming, you WILL NOT like this album. Those of you looking for indie rock should turn right back around to your snooty reviews on &quot;pitchforkmedia.com&quot; and return to your &quot;Radiohead&quot; shrine, 'cuz this ain't it. Deftones are often dubbed &quot;the Radiohead of metal&quot; which I find rather lame, not because Radiohead is bad music...but because of the bum rap it gives to metal in general. It assumes metal is BAD, but this my friends is good...just DURN good metal.<br />From the opening riff of &quot;Shove It (My Own Summer)&quot; to the churning riffs of the album closer &quot;MX&quot; this album will steadily hold your attention. &quot;Shove It&quot; is one of the best heavy rock album openers of all time, &quot;Blind&quot; by KoRn being another on the top 10 list. The Deftones let you know immediately what you're in for, unique, groove-oriented riffage courtesy of the ESP wielding Stephen Carpenter, fabulous drumming by drummer extrordinaire Abe Cunningham, rhythm bass assistance by Chi Cheng, and the bloodcurdling shrieks and chorus saturated vocals of Chino Moreno.<br />This album is almost perfectly paced, each song melding deliciously to the next. The production values are top notch, courtesy of mix-master/producer Terry Date. Not since the Smashing Pumpkins' &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; album have I heard such a lush wall of sound. This recording is so dense you'll feel like you've bathed in guitar sounds, rumbling bass, hard-hittin' drums and ear piercing shrieks...scary sounding I know, but oh, my sweet Lord how wonderful it is!<br />Of course we all know that &quot;Be Quiet and Drive Far Away&quot; is a great song...it should be noted though, that it is a VERY difficult feat to make a song that is both heavy, AND very soothing at the same time. When I listen to this song I don't know whether I should take a therapeutic bubble bath, or smash the damned thing with a sledgehammer.<br />That being said, I have only two gripes about this album. 1) &quot;Mascara&quot; is almost a terrible song, I have been able to sit through it from time to time, but often times I just have to hit skip. <br />2) The hidden track on this album is like 30 minutes past &quot;MX.&quot; I have listened to this song maybe 4 times...and I have had this album for SEVERAL years now. That's a little too long to hit skip, you'll literally have to hold your finger on the fast forward button for at least 5 minutes to get there on some CD players. There's just, NO REASON for this. <br />This being said, if you like &quot;Screamo&quot; listen to this album. It is by far the best album in The Deftones' catalog. The problems is, when you an make an album THIS good, it's almost impossible to follow itup. The Deftones have yet to even COME CLOSE to the quality of this album. Each album both before and after do little to match the pinnacle achieved here. I don't know whether this is a good or bad thing, because history seldom repeats itself...
0792833279|5.0|This is one of the cleverest comedies out there. John Travolta plays a bookie (Chili Palmer) in Miami Beach, FL. He is one of these respected hard nose, no BS type of people that just demands respect wherever he goes. But for a change of pace and a change of heart, not to mention money that is owned to him, he flies out to California. He is searching for a man who took a very large some of money, but in the mean time is caught up in the Hollywood movie making industry. He meets up and makes friends with Gene Hackman, a B movie director always looking for the next big break. Rene Russo plays a B movie washed up actress who is helping Travolta get into the movie industry. Mean while, old friends and enemies follow Travolta to the sunshine state to find out what he is up to and possibly move in on the action. This movie also has Danny DeVito, Dennis Farina, cameo by Penny Marshall, Delroy Lindo, James Gandolfini, and more twists and turns that you can imagine. If you are looking for a really fun comedy with lots of stars then this is the movie to get!
6304602944|4.0|what can i say?  This movie epitomizes the essence of the macho, testosterone driven, 80's action movie.  ....its so awful, but in such a gloriously funny way.  never fails to deliver a good, roll on the ground, belly laugh. the cliches come one after the other.   jack palances character is brilliant.  highly recommended...if you can appreciate and find value in the &quot;stupid movie&quot;.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|The Italian job is another antihero bank robbing gang movie. But this one does it very well. The short and sweet of it is you have a group of guys that are planning to rob a safe out of someone's house in Italy. After they successfully pull the job off, one of them turns on the rest of the group, steals all the money and gold and ends up shooting the senior most \\"this is my last job and I'm retiring\\" member played by the veteran Donald Sutherland. The rest of the movie is spent trying to chase down the member who stole everything and get there gold back along with a little payback. The acting is good, the action and dialogue is smartly done and keeps me very interested. I definitely liked this movie and I think if you're an action and or crime/bank job drama fan you will enjoy this DVD. Go pick it up!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Thank goodness that this final installment gets back to the compelling story telling that made the first move the best science fiction movie ever made. Yes, the visual efftects are stunning in Revolutions, but thank goodness nothing \\"new\\" was contrived for this movie. Reloaded was top heavy with cartoonish virtual relaity effects and relentless action scenes. In Revolutions, expect to find a lot of action, but as with the first movie the action fits with the story- there is no less or no more than the story demands. After I saw Reloaded, I was disappointed- needed a few more viewings to really get into the story. After an IMAX viewing and watching on the regular big screen and on DVD, I came to the understanding that it was great film. However, after only one viewing of Revolutions-- I am hooked. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the film. I took so much away, but as with the first movie, walking out of the theater I wondered just how much more was in the movie that I missed. Took everything I had not to buy a ticket to the next showing. Everytime I watch the first Matrix, I find something compelling and interesting that I had not noticed before (that is saying a lot for someone who can recite just about every line), and I have this nagging feeling that the same will be true of Revolutions. I loved the final scene! I was worried for a split second we might end up with dancing ewoks or something as ridiculous-like another [party] in Zion- thank goodness The Ws knew when to stop the film (much like they did with the original Matrix). This is one of the best \\"ends\\" to a legacy that I have seen- just enough questions are answered and just enough questions lurking behind. After all, it is the question that drives us. If anyone ever makes a Matrix 4- they will destroy a beautiful story. \\"Everything happened because it was meant to happen, and it could not of happened any other way.\\"
B00009V7T2|5.0|I really don't see how Mars Volta are emo. The music is too intricate and the vocalist reminds me more of a cross between Geddy Lee and Maynard James Keenan. And the lyrical content doesn't consist to the usual whiny &quot;My girlfriend broke up with me.&quot; crap. This album is progressive and very experimental, and that totally defies emo. I really do not see how this band emerged in that scene. I hate emo. But I don't hate Mars Volta, how is that? They aren't emo queers, ... they're good musicians, period.<br />(Sorry emo fans if my opinionated ranting offends you.)
B00005AXEL|5.0|Trouble in Shangri-La is Stevie's 10th solo album. It is by far the best record of 2001 and one of Stevie's greatest works. For a long time Stevie couldn't find the inspiration to write. But after dinner with Tom Petty she found that she could in fact do it without the help of guest writers, etc. Stevie did call Sheryl Crow in to produce the album, but this was strictly a success of Stevie's. In the end she came out with an absolutely fabulous album which fans will rave about for decades to come. As a 14 year-old fan, I will definitely be raving about this record for MANY decades to come; as well as all of Stevie's other wondrful albums :)<br />Nikayla Crews
0060931671|5.0|At a slim 150 pages, this novella works as a good, and indicative, introduction to Pynchon. Perhaps it is far more impressive, formally, than his other longer novels (Gravity's Rainbow, V., Mason &amp; Dixon, Vineland), all of which are between 500-800 pages, except for the latter, simply because he manages to weave the same intricacy and texture at a fraction of his usual length.<br />Enter the journey of Oedipa Maas, who follows the trail backwards in time of her dead husband. Is somebody following her? Or is she the one who is following? Pieces start fitting together, slowly- the etching of a muted horn on a bathroom stall, old stamps with spelling errors, a man-made lake with an interesting bottom, characters in a play with a little bit too much information- all this and much, much more.<br />Pynchon's novels are about 'information', regardless of how historical, accurate, absurd, erronous, redundant, symbolic, inconsistent, incomprehensible they are, or seem. Most authors create an objective autonomous system of values, characters, and logic within their novels. Pynchon trangresses these conservative formalisms- his writing is so distant and awkward, yet so humane and flesh-like. He is like no other writer. He stuffed an epic into a novella, about a woman who found out what was happening to her all along, in the end.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|I've been a fan of Donna Summer since 1978, when I heard MacArthur Park blasting on the airwaves.  Although I heard her earlier hits, I wasn't a big fan until that song came out.  Her voice is simply great.  I agree with others that there are too many greatest hits compiliations, but it's not totally Donna's fault.  The record company feel they can make quick money by releasing these packages.  I like The Journey, because it's remastered and it includes 2 new songs of which I enjoy.  I think they should have deleted Could It Be Magic, I Love You, and Love Is In Control and included Unconditional Love, There Goes My Baby, Dinner With Gershwin, Love's About To Change My Heart, Work That Magic, Friends Unknown, Melody of Love and The Power of One.  As for the second CD, they should have deleted I Feel Love (the Dance Collection and Bad Girls Deluxe Set already has it) and included a remix of Melody of Love. Donna should include more R&B and ballads to her repertoire.  Whatever she sings on her new album, I will buy it.  I AM A FAN.  And a note to Donna: Please come back to Hawaii to perform, because the last concert you did was back in 1979, when Bad Girls was the rage.  Aloha.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Matrix Revolutions<br />     The Matrix trilogy is indeed a set of movies well packaged and presented.  As is the case with all things that human beings are witness to, perception differs with differing perspectives.  At the same time, the perspective one takes reflects his/her maturity, overall orientation, predominant thoughts and the objective with which he/she comes to witness what he/she witnesses.<br />     The Matrix trilogy is well packaged because it has something to offer both for those who just need some entertainment to break the monotony of life and also those who wish to fish for something deeper, something to take back home.  <br />     Beyond the façade of cool sunglasses, fantastic weapons and fabulous special effects - the kind Industrial Light and Magic have been known to produce - there lies a very interesting mixture of spiritual beliefs.  If the characters and plot of the story are looked at as something symbolic, the movie offers an experience similar to cracking a code.  <br />     The movie has done quite well in the balancing act - That of carefully interspersing fight scenes, special effects and science fiction with what in reality has been talked about since time immemorial:  perception ?reality, duality ?unity, bondage ?freedom, choice ?price and finally equilibrium ?disequilibrium.  What is interesting is that by interspersing the two, the potential monotony and banality of having just one of the two is avoided.  <br />     With regards to the spiritual journey, the trilogy takes us from the point when one who believes in the illusion is disillusioned (being liberated from the Matrix, that is but a symbol for the world that we take as real), he proceeds to higher levels of consciousness, where at each level he is restricted by his own perception of reality.    When to perform a certain function he has to return to the Matrix, thought liberated, he is again governed by the rules of the Matrix (When Gods descend to the world in the formof avatars, they are born, and thus they will die).  Destiny plays a role in fixing the function of each character and as the function is completed, the characters disappear.  Quite naturally, as the law of duality has it that \\"what has a beginning, must have an end.?(Hence the search for the eternal unchanging?)  We also see motifs like \\"the chosen one,?\\"messiah,?\\"trinity,?\\"prophet?and finally the mindless, attribute less, omnipresent centre, source or ultimate, all in personified forms.  The chosen one is chosen for a task he has to perform, which he performs with the aid of others whose function is to aid him.  He moves on as they fall off and in the end he has to leave even the trinity behind (Matrix Revolutions).  In all of this, there is again the play of free will, belief and choice.  There is nothing right or wrong, there is only a choice, and every choice has a price to pay for.  So an unbeliever starts from disbelief to experimentation, from experimentation to experience, from experience to belief and from belief to faith.  <br />     In sum, there can be as many interpretations of the trilogy as there are people.  That is quite similar to as many views of the world as there are people.  What is interesting is that in ways similar to what He has done, the directors have scooped a bit of the ocean and put it in a container for us to see.  If the water in the container is a part of the greater whole, it would also present us a manageable microcosm of its source to analyze and understand.  Naturally, we can choose to do that or take the container to be what it is.  Again, it is just a choice!<br />     As for hints from the director, the Sanskrit hymns at the end of the movie say a lot.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|When I first popped this CD in I was disappointed.  Five years for this? and from someone I respect as much as Sarah?  But I was willing to listen again because I felt I owed Sarah that much...and this album got several magnitudes better.  &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; sounds like it could've been off of F.T.E., and &quot;Answer&quot; is just gorgeous.  Though I think there will always be some songs on here I don't like that much (&quot;World on Fire,&quot; &quot;Train Wreck&quot;), and it's certainly not as strong of an album as F.T.E., it's definitely worth a listen and gets better with repeat listening.  <br />This album is subtler than her previous work, which I think is part of why it's been getting weak reviews.  But the mellowness appeals to me. It's not the emotional abyss of the others either, but certainly enjoyable.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|The Strokes return with an album that sounds a whole lot like \\"Is This It.\\" They knew they had a good thing going, so they stuck with it. They combine a touch of new wave (a few repeated synth loops and lots of chiming guitar riffs), folk (simple songs with complex, storytelling lyrics), lots of rock (loud electric guitars and a heartbeat rhythm section), and even the blues (singer Julian Casablancas is unhappy about his love life and isn't afraid to whine about it). Every song blends each these musical styles without sounding cluttered or pretentious.<br />There are a few things holding this CD back from four or five stars. The first is the length. I'm not a big fan of the overlong, fill-the-entire-CD albums most major bands put out --- but 33 minutes? Second, there's no songs on this album that are as good as the best from \\"Is This It.\\" None of the new songs are as good as \\"Last Nite\\" or \\"Alone Together.\\" But still, it's worth buying. It's an impressive follow-up to a brilliant debut.

B00005JKC3|1.0|The Hulk was so bad I couldn't even bring myself t finish it. After about an hr, I had enough. The trailer makes the film look so exciting, intense, and well made. However, it's a big mess. From the special effects to the acting. Eric Bana as the Hulk does a decent job, but Nick Nolte is horrendoes, and Jennifer Connelly is  boring. She speaks in a whisper the whole film, and the only reason i can come up with as to why she does this, is to prove she is a serious Academy Award winning actress. The special effects are horrific. The Hulk looks so fake, and if Gollum from Lord of the Rings look real, why couldn't the Hulk. I admire Ang Lee for taking on such a project, but his comic book directing, with split screens and all are distracting. Skip the Hulk. It's a complete waste of time.
B00005JMFR|4.0|If you're not a fan of kung fu movies, science fiction movies, war movies, Keanu Reeves' flawless complexion, Laurence Fishburne's pocked complexion, or movies with strong biblical (the New Testament) references, then the final installment in The Matrix Trilogy is not for you. You probably didn't like the first or the second installments, and will be truly disappointed with the third.<br />Let's get a few things straight first. Matrix Revolutions is not a perfect movie, and neither were its predecessors. There are at least two plot twists that are cliched. There are some questions that remain unanswered from The Matrix Reloaded. The language is stilted, but that was a fault/plus of all The Matrix movies. (It is in my opinion that the stilted language was a stylization by the directors of the movie. It's supposed to flow along like a church hymn. You're supposed to follow the rhythm, and not necessarily the words.) The Matrix, the original, continues to be a stand-alone movie. The movie didn't really require 2 more sequels to answer its mysteries. With all that said, see Matrix Revolutions because it rocked.<br />The Matrix is still the best in the series, but Matrix Revolutions wraps up things very nicely. I will not give away any plot developments, except to say that maybe you should read the New Testament. The pseudo philosophical and spiritual overtones of Revolutions are not as heavy, muddled or as vague as in the first two movies. The spiritual lesson taught in this movie is simple: You must never give up faith. As a person at the beginning of her spiritual quest, I appreciate the messages and questions the Warchowski (sp?) brothers throw into this series. However, it is a movie and not a religious text.<br />Most of the scenes in the movie take place in the \\"real world,\\" so there aren't many visuals of Morpheus in his green 'gator shoes, Trinity in her liquid latex cat suit, or Naiobi in her to-die-for Bantu knots. What you do see is a group of ragged people fighting for peace, and trying not to lose their faith. What you do see is Neo trying to figure out his place in this universe. The Matrix Revolutions does have the hold-your-breath chases, fight scenes, and battles against the machines. (I dare you not to gasp when swarms of machines break through the walls of Zion. It is all at once beautiful and petrifying.)<br />Matrix Revolutions is definitely a must see. The ending of the film will require some post-viewing analysis, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great action film to take you out of your self for a couple of hours. Even if the movie were to shed its religious pretensions, it would still be a great action film to see on the big screen. Don't listen to the haters. Have faith that it will be worth the $10 you invested to see it. Peace!ighting for peace, and trying not to lose their faith. What you do see is Neo trying to figure out his place in this universe. The Matrix Revolutions does have the hold-your-breath chases, fight scenes, and battles against the machines. (I dare you not to gasp when swarms of machines break through the walls of Zion. It is all at once beautiful and petrifying.)<br />Matrix Revolutions is definitely a must see. The ending of the film will require some post-viewing analysis, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great action film to take you out of your self for a couple of hours. Even if the movie were to shed its religious pretensions, it would still be a great action film to see on the big screen. Don't listen to the haters. Have faith that it will be worth the $10 you invested to see it. Peace!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The world of critics couldn't shut up about this band a couple of years ago, but I get the feeling like it's *this* record that will gain the most following.<br />It's eleven songs that admittedly sound exactly like the Strokes.  But somehow, the vocal fluctuations (however drab they may be at times), Fraiture's basslines, and Valensi's melodic guitar playing sound so much better this time around -- so much more inspired.  Even the shortcomings seem irrelevant: the lyrics are more simple at times, but Casablancas sure sings the hell out of them.  They play so tight, that these guys kiss eachother is definitely in the scope of probability.  <br />Call the record &quot;Strokes filler,&quot; but the cuts on the whole win out over their first outing in a lot of ways.  I could go on about song structures, hooks (or no hooks), and choruses, but simply put: at the close of each song I am excited about the next one.  Part of me is surprised that I can get truly excited about Velvet Underground and Television inflections throughout -- but I am.  That makes Room on Fire a new sort of accomplishment, capable of getting me to change my attitude on decades-old music.<br />I suppose you can't have a second date without a first, and it was 2001's effort, after all, that really got this thing going.  However, only at this point have I stopped debating -- and finally decided that this must be it.
B00005JMFI|2.0|I was really expecting, 'Elf' to b special but it falls flat. Still I got a few laughs. Will make a decent 1 dollar Blockbuster holiday rental.I can't totally knock it.
B00005JMFR|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the Matrix and the whole idea behind it. 1 and 2 were great movies, full of action and awesome special effects. Revolutions however was a horrible way to end such a legendary story. It was cluttered with scenery instead of cool special effects and fight scenes, and if felt very dragging. I was expecting to see Neo finish the whole thing and he didn't do anything monumental (I won't ruin the end for those who haven't seen it) I also got this feeling of a religious metaphor with the savior and sacrifice and peace and all....not my style, thanks. I actually booed at the end. Better than most movies, yes, but come on, this is the MATRIX! It was a disgrace. I won't buy the DVD.
B000007S5B|4.0|&quot;Waiting For The Sun,&quot; The Doors' third album, is one of their  more underrated albums. Indeed, it strays from the edgy-driven rock power, and dark psychedelia of their two previous albums, but it is not a bad album at all. This is one of their &quot;poppier&quot; albums.<br />Check out the fun, goovey laid-back tune of &quot;We Could Be So Good Together&quot; and &quot;Love Street,&quot; two songs that make you want to just kick back and nod your head from side to side. These two show the softer side of The Doors. <br />The lone hit on &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; is the radio-friendly psychedelic-pop tune, &quot;Hello I Love You,&quot; featuring the unmistakable melodic fuzz of Ray Manzarek's keyboards and the sizzling guitars of Robbie Krieger. I beleive the closest being to a second hit was &quot;The Unkonown Soldier,&quot; an interesting, somewhat disturbing cut that is powerfully charged with thick keyboard work. In the song, you can hear Morrison leading the march of soldiers to where they exucute someone. It's The Doors' battle song and is very well done. Morrison delivers some very fine vocals here. <br />&quot;Five To One&quot; is another power-charged song with stomping, edgy, rugged rock. It is driven by Jim Morrision's harsh, demanding vocals. This song, along with &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; are probably the heaviest-driven songs on the album, although &quot;My Wild Love&quot; is a power-charged song based on just vocals, save a quirky buzzing effect with hand-clapping. &quot;My Wild Love&quot; is probably one of the album's weaker songs. It's more chanting than singing.   <br />The Doors offer plenty of free-flowing, trippy songs with &quot;Wintertime Love,&quot; &quot;Summer's Almost Gone,&quot; &quot;Yes The River Knows&quot; and &quot;Spanish Caravan.&quot; &quot;Summer's Almost Gone&quot; is a slower, piano-featured number, while &quot;Wintertime Love&quot; is a bit more intense, with a neat marching shuffle provided by John Densmore and his drums, melodic Manzarek keyboards, and dark, silky Jim Morrison vocals. &quot;Spanish Caravan,&quot; features unique flamenco guitar coating from Robby Krieger, and &quot;Yes, The River Knows&quot; is an infectious tune with more great keyboard-piano work from Manzarek. It's smooth and light and makes you want to close your eyes and drift away. <br />The most infectious tune on the whole album in my opinion is &quot;Not To Touch The Earth.&quot; This is my favorite cut from this album, and whenever I listen to it, I always need to play it again. It is probably the strangest song I've ever heard from The Doors, but it is strange is a very delightful way. It is a dark, and disturbing cut that is very eerie. It features very strange, awkward, wavy, warped-sounding keyboard chords, and guitar notes. This, along with Morrison's trademark dark, brooding, mysterious voice, brings it all together in a psychedelic dream that is literally &quot;out of this world.&quot; I love how it starts out slow, dark and weird, before bursting into a powerfully charged chorus, with thick Manzarek keyboards, flawless Krieger guitar power (his bottle neck guitar playing is awesome) and stomping Densmore drums; and Jim Morrison's &quot;Run with me......run with me.....run with me.......let's run!&quot; The sounds then build up into a different octave, and the drums seem to stomp faster, as if in time with somebody running. Whenever I think of &quot;Waiting For The Sun,&quot; this is the first song that comes to mind.<br />Not one of The Doors' best, but still a must have Doors album. For first-time Doors listeners, I'd recommend listening to their debut album and their second album &quot;Strange Days&quot; before trying this album out. The real strength of The Doors can be found in their first two albums. After listening to &quot;The Doors&quot; and &quot;Strange Days,&quot; &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot; is obviously a bit different, but it is an enjoyable album worth several listens over and over. Buy, buy, buy!!
B00007LTIA|5.0|Back in 1973, the target market for this sort of music -- 14 to 22-year-olds, mostly male, academic rather than sporty -- had time on its hands. You need to remember that:<br />  1. There was no Internet.<br />  2. There was no GameBoy, Playstation or other video game.<br />  3. There were just three TV stations (for us in the UK), and they usually closed down before midnight.<br />  4. There was no video-recording medium available at an affordable price.<br />As a teenager at the time, I remember sitting around a lot doing not much!<br />The one artistic medium that the consumer could really control was sound i.e. music, with radio, LPs and the compact cassette working together to enable the listener to enjoy the material whenever he or she wanted. People spent proportionately much more of their income on this one medium than they do now. (Indeed concert tickets at the time typically cost rather less than an LP.) So many artists put a lot of effort to get their recorded output as perfect as possible. Pink Floyd, for example, spent years getting 'The Dark Side of the Moon', also released in 1973, precisely right.<br />Other artists, such as Genesis and Yes, decided for one album each that more effort meant more length. Genesis produced 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway', while Yes created the controversial 'Tales from Topographic Oceans'.<br />I had been entranced by Yes, ever since buying a cassette version of 'Close to the Edge' the previous year, purely on the basis of a few colour photos!  I had pre-ordered the new double LP from a mail order firm that believed it was called 'Tales from Tobergraphic Oceans'.<br />I have to admit that even in those days, you needed to be a pretty committed fan to defend the album. There weren't enough catchy tunes, and you had to change sides three times to listen to the whole thing. (Thankfully with CD, you only need to change sides once.) We didn't fight or even argue over it -- we just ignored each other's pet favourites, such as Genesis, David Bowie, or the Eagles. (I'm begining to think that what killed the mid-1970s progressive excess wasn't so much Punk Rock, but actually the more accessible, and much shorter tunes written by intelligent US bands such as Steely Dan, Little Feat and the Doobie Brothers.)<br />Topographic Oceans introduced the Yes world to not just Jon Anderson's theological pursuit but also the drumming of Alan White. I feel that was one of the big disappointments of the album, as well as Wakeman's general lack of presence. White was OK at hitting a simple beat on the tom-toms, but he just seemed to lack the jazz-tinged subtlety of Bill Bruford, who helped make CLOSE TO THE EDGE such a five-star classic.<br />Another marketing mistake that Topographic made was not including any photos of the band, an error repeated only on 'Relayer'. Judging by the Roger Dean cover, this was an album for the fish. It was utterly impersonal.<br />After the album and the tour, the band effectively split for several months, with each member creating solo albums -- e.g. Olias of Sunhillow, Fish out of Water, Beginnings. Rick Wakeman split more permanently, to pursue his interest in Jules Verne and King Arthur, returning to make 'Going for the One'.<br />In retrospect, Anderson's musical vision was too grandiose, and the lyrics were of interest to only a tiny portion even of Yes fans. Topographic Oceans can be heard today as a flawed symphony. For the committed Yes fan, it never really flags. Because we know it so well, no track is better than any other, and the whole thing is in many ways a great work.<br />But long gone are the days when you would simply listen to this sort of music with friends -- listening and doing nothing else, besides perhaps looking at the album cover. Nowadays we're so short of time that we play this sort of stuff as background music, while we're working or driving. It's less portentous that it once was, but it's a lot better than silence.nesis, David Bowie, or the Eagles.

B00005JMFR|5.0|When I read some of the reviews for the Matrix Revolutions, I was a bit skeptic about going and seeing it.  In fact my own city newspaper said that the movie had a slow pace to it.  However after seeing the movie I can safely say that it's great.  The battle scenes are all magnificant.  The three big fights are Club Hell, the Zion battle for the dock, and Neo Vs. Smith.  Now I'm not going to go into how any of those were or anything.  However what I will say is that both the Dock battle scene and the Neo Vs. Smith fight were amazing.  As I sat there watching the machines fight I couldn't help but just staring in sheer amazement.  As for the Neo Vs. Smith fight, I must say that it was so much better than the Burely Brawl scene in Reloaded.  The CGI effects mix in almost perfectly with the real animation.  There's only one time when you can truely tell that the characters were replaces by CGI clones but I won't go into much detail on that.<BR> <BR>As for the rest of the movie, it seems to flow pretty well.  If you haven't seen Reloaded then you're going to want to because you'll be completely lost without it.  If there's one complaint that people might have it's that there isn't much time spent inside the Matrix, which could dissapoint some people who wanted to see a lot of wall jumping and such.<br />All in all I really liked Revolutions.  It does bring closure to the trilogy but also leaves us wondering if there will one day be another Matrix movie (although with the way Revolutions does end, I'm not sure many people are going to want another one).  My favorite part about the ending was the fact that it didn't turn out like anything anyone had thought it would.  I remember reading around the internet about these endings that were fool proof and would make total sense.  But before I leave, may I ask you this?  Would Revolutions really be a Matrix film if it gave you all the answers.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|I have watched this DVD many, many times over the years and still find it very interesting.  It's even funnier now that he's the governor of my state.  This is a great glimpse into Arnold and his razor sharp intelligence.  Most people don't realize how smart Arnold is until you watch this DVD.  He dominated the bodybuilding sport not only because of his physique, but also because of the mental dominance he held over the other competitors.  A great example of this can be seen on the DVD with how he interacts with Lou Ferrigno, and is able to thoroughly get into Lou's head crushing down just a little more of his confidence.  Although Lou's father didn't help either.  This is a must watch film for any Arnold fan, or anyone who lives in California and would like to know the type of guy our new Governor is.  Oh yeah, and the pot smoking scene is hilarious(read the shirt)!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I am very delighted with Sarah McLachlan's new material after six years of absence.  I do admit though, her material is different from her past cd's.  The tracks on this cd are less edgier than from previous material that can be found on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing, but these songs still contain the intelligent lyrics that all her previous songs contains.  Each song has a deeper meaning as to what the lyrics portray, and can be understood further with the instrumentation from each track.  I can't wait for sarah's future cd's becasue from a previous review I have read and agree with, the best of Sarah is to come.  For those who are first time Sarah Fan, I would reccommend Surfacing so that beginners would be able to understand the lyrical content of Sarah, and as well as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.  WIthin this Cd there are three tracks that just stand out the most when I first heard them.  They are Fallen, Stupid, and Train Wreck.  Sarah's voice is superb and clear where you can hear her lyrics unlike other singers that fake their voices, Sarah is not afraid because her voice is not fallen!  Her lyrics continue to be meaningful as always, and even so more.  In  addition, this cd is written from the heart, amazing comeback!  I am proud that Sarah made a strong comeback to the music scene.  5 stars! I love sarah! Great artist.  I can see more Grammy's from Sarah.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I'm not a country fan...and I'm not a Johnny Cash fan... but I'm married to one... I'm an alterative/classic rock kinda girl which is why I was drawn to this album.  I wanted to hear his cover of Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot;.  I first saw the video at 4am in the morning...it was fascinating... so I bought the album as soon as it came out...much to my husband's delight (now I'll let him play country music in the car he thinks!) and &quot;Hurt&quot; was just the tip of the iceberg.  <br />The first track &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is a fabulous song musically, I could (and have) listened to it over and over and over again.  I'm not into the whole Christianity/Revelation thing but the songs lyrics present quite a visual as well.  This song makes purchasing the album worth it alone.  A bit of musical brilliance in the dawn of Mr. Cash's life-- he was talented until the end.<br />It was also quite intesting to the cover songs... purists probably can't stand the fact that he did Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel songs but I think they're interesting intrepretations... they certainly grow on you.<br />I must say the album cover is also quite an interesting choice.  His face looks very introspective, which I think is very representative of this album... I think the songs were chosen carefully in the twilight of his life... at least that's how it seems to me, the listener.<br />So now I'm digging up all of my husband's old Johnny Cash albums to see what other treasures I can find...
B0000C6E4D|4.0|It must be one of the biggest disappointments in an artist's career to hear fans say, &quot;Why doesn't this album sound like your last album?&quot;  C'mon, people...who wants 5 copies of FTE?  The lady got married, had a daughter, took some time off, and grew her hair out (sweet!), so wouldn't you expect to hear a different sound?  Tons of posts on Amazon have said that &quot;Afterglow&quot; is boring.  I'd say &quot;boring&quot; is putting out the same style of music from CD to CD.<br />Some random thoughts:<br />1. &quot;Time&quot; is one of the best songs I've ever heard.<BR>2. There's no DRM on this disc.  Rip away!<BR>3. &quot;BandLink&quot; is annoying, but worth installing.  And if you cancel the installation, any music program will play the CD.<BR>4. Too bad the photos that are on I-Tunes, for one, don't show up in the CD sleeve.<br />Who can complain about these lyrics?  Are you people insane?<br />You see love<BR>A tight thorny thread that you<BR>spin in a circle of gold<BR>To have me to hold me<BR>A token for all to see<br />Captured to be yours alone<br />Like every other Sarah McLachlan album I've bought and played to death, &quot;Afterglow&quot; grows on you.  It's not laden with singles, but that would have disappointed people who jumped on board with &quot;Surfacing.&quot;  Who can please everyone?  Certainly not me.  But Sarah's work is consistently so.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Afterglow is Awesome!! I am a Sarah fan for life!!  She is just an amazing songwriter and artist. &quot;Stupid&quot; is my favorite song so far.  I bought the album on Teusday and I have been listening to it all week.  If you are into good, solid thought provoking music then buy this album!!
0743244249|2.0|Bottom line: This is not one of DeLillo's best, and close to one of his worst. While it started out with promise, the promise was unfulfilled.<br />To me the pacing was interminable. While this book is almost one-quarter the length of UNDERGROUND, it took me three times longer to read. Part of the issue was the utter contempt I had for the main character, Eric Packer. You're not supposed to like him, I know, I know. But there are thousands of characters in literature that you aren't supposed to like but they are interesting, at least. Not this guy.<br />The other issue I have with the book is that it seems so dated. While it takes to task the materialism of the '90s (which seem so far away since 9/11 and the market crash just before it), the flavor really smacks of the Walter Gekko-greed of the 1980s. There's nothing wrong with that but even the dated nature would have seemed extra-dated just five years ago.<br />A long time ago I learned that even your best buddies can let you down. The same goes, it seems, for your favorite writers.
B000060P79|1.0|So this is what has happened to music huh? I feel sorry for all of you kiddies growing up these days. The music that MTV and radio plays these days is complete and utter garbage!! Thank god i was born in the early 80's and grew up with the AMAZING music of the early 90's. With REAL bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, The Pixies, Alice in Chains, Sonic Youth, Metallica dominating the musical landscape. These day's it's just phony tripe. No creativity or originality invloved. If you want to get enlightened just listen to the bands i listed. They will send you off to a world that is a far cry from the sewage that pollutes the airwaves these days.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Ah, yes!  This is what we needed.  A burst of unfocused creativity to jump-start rock 'n' roll!  Thank you Ryan Adams.  Thank you all five Strokes.<br />This diverse, uneven, but nonetheless brilliant album could almost serve as a summary of the rock era since its beginnings with Elvis Presley's &quot;Sun Sessions&quot; in the 1950s so diverse are Adams' classic rock influences.<br />Adams is, shall we say, very influenced by his influences.  In plain fact he comes close to doing impressions here.  It's almost a postmodern device, this play-acting, this shape-shifting; it almost admits rock has run of of new ideas and has been reduced to homage.  But, on the other hand, the breadth of Ryan Adams' talent for mimickry nearly creates a new genre; call it &quot;cuisinart rock&quot; where everything is tossed in, or &quot;summary rock&quot; which recapitulates in 45 minutes a half-century of rock personalities, especially those of archetypically American males.  Adams isn't the only male singer-songwriter doing such impressions; so are Beck, Basement Jaxx, Rufus Wainwright, and the Strokes to name but a few.<br />Anyway, back to the ironically titled &quot;Gold,&quot; which isn't only Adam's gold (Yes, he's a gifted songwriter and malleable singer) but the gold records of the last 50 years.  &quot;Firecracker&quot; sounds like Bob Dylan down to the rasp and the harmonica.  &quot;Answering Bell&quot; mimics &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;-era Van Morrison.  &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot; cribs Bruce Springsteen from &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&quot;  &quot;The Rescue Blues&quot; and &quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues&quot; borrow from both the slow and fast modalities of the Rolling Stones around 1969's &quot;Let It Bleed.&quot;  &quot;Somehow Someday&quot; sounds like Elvis Presley or, more accurately, Presley's latest mimic, Chris Isaac.  &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; is a effete lush poetic Morrissey homage.  &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; recalls Don McLean's &quot;Starry Starry Night,&quot; another tender well-crafted ballad about a doomed artist.  &quot;Enemy Fire&quot; rocks out like Paul Westerberg.  &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; does a cheerful impression of the Who, and &quot;Wildflowers&quot; taps into a wimpering gorgeous Neil Young persona.  &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard&quot; closes the album with Adams morphing into Tom Waits, droll and drooling tour guide of LA bar nightlife.<br />Ryan Adams breaks new ground by being the first &quot;it-boy,&quot; the first flaming undeniable talent on the rock scene with a total lack of new ideas.  As post-rock albums like Radiohead's &quot;Kid A&quot; march onto the scene, Ryan Adams clings to memories of rootsy Americana:  Tom Petty, the Eagles, CCR, The Band.  It's a beautiful elegy from by a gifted shape-shifting artist.  Buy it for the time capsule.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet are an Australian four piece that combine the melodic depth of a blues band with the energy of a rock outfit. Each and every song on the album stands out as unique and memorable, my favourites being 'Move on' and 'Are you gonna be my girl'. They are at once moving and uplifting, and cannot afford to be missed. This is a refreshing light in a fog of modern rock pap and none of the magic that they convey when playing live is lost at CD level.
B000069AUI|5.0|Quoted by Oasis as the band who will save rock music, Coldplay is the new age Beatles, mixed in with a bit of Oasis and American influence. Definately one of the greatest pieces of musical art today!
B00005JMFR|2.0|I was looking forward to go see the Matrix Revolution, but it was very dissapointing, nothing like the first two.  The whole movie is about fighting the machines, and they hardly ever go into the Matrix.  There are no realy intense fight scenes.  My advice is to never go see this movie, it is not worth it, a waste of money.  I will never go and see this movie again, I wont even watch it when it comes out on cable.  Life is to short, do not waste your time.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|My thoughts about Jurassic Park were AMAZING!!! Even though it came out in 1993 when I was only 1, I still claim the movie is amazing! In fact it is my favorite movie of all time.<BR>  One of the most successful movies in all time is also a movie that changed the way movies were made forever with it's awsome computer animation.<BR>  What made me think the movie was so awesome, was the life like dinosaurs. But my favorite part was whith the T-Rex. It was the most amazing thing I had ever saw the first time I saw it. Spielberg really made an awesome movie that time.<BR>  From what I think, Jurassic Park was an success, but The Lost World didn't do as good as the firt Jurassic Park. But then there was Jurassic Park111 which was practicly a failure. I mean whith the spinosaurus and somehow it always finds the people. Sort of like Godzilla...sort of.<BR>  Also from what I heard, is that there is going to be another Jurassic Park..Jurassic Park4. If there is going to be a Jurassic Park4 then the first thing I want is the T-Rex to be king again. The next thing is John Hammond to be back. And maybe Tim and Lex back also. Then I would like the original music back from Jurassic Park.<BR>  I would like the movie to take place on Isla Nublar, I mean that it would be cool to see the visitor center in ruins. And also from what I heard was that John Hammond might die in Jurassic Park4. Then he would pass down Ingen to Tim. But John Hammond can't die.....John Hammond is Jurassic Park..John Hammond dies.....Jurassic Park dies!
B00008DDXC|5.0|All too often, Hollywood makes a successful film, and in the hype of the sudden success, they rush out to produce a sequel that pales in comparison to their original effort.  Happily, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets does not fall into this sterotype.<br />The Chamber of Secrets reunites the original cast from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  It is year two for the students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and there is something afoot at the school.  Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) are brought together again and must discover who has opened the Chamber of Secrets.  This film, which is somewhat darker than the first, also features much of the supporting cast.<br />The story, which opens with Harry receiving a visit from Dobby, the House Elf, warning that Harry must not return to Hogwarts.  Despite Dobby's warnings, Harry returns, to find that there are strange happenings at the school.   The paralyzed bodies of students around the campus are uncovered, and in each case, Harry is found with them.  To clear his name and uncover the secret behind the many strage goings-on around the campus, Harry begins a quest that will take him into the heart of the Chamber of Secrets, and face to face with a monster that has long been dormant in the bowels of the school.<br />This film, like its predecessor, was under the direction of Chris Columbus.  Where the first film worked on developing the characters and the relationships between the characters, this film bypasses most of this exposition, save for the introduction of Gilderoy Lockhart (delightfully brought to life by veteran actor Kenneth Branagh), a bumbling, arrogant and incompetent wizard and new teacher of the dark arts into the strong supporting cast.<br />As mentioned earlier, this film is darker than the first.  For younger viewers, there are several scenes which might be frightening; most specifically, moments such as when the boys confront a cave of spiders, the final moments when Harry confronts a giant serpent in the Chamber of Secrets, and when the various bodies are discovered paralyzed.  <br />Still, this is a delightful, fun film, full of beautiful imagery and lavish special effects.  For anyone who is new to the world of Harry Potter, the Chamber of Secrets stands alone as a film, and though viewing of the earlier film might allow the viewer to better understand the characters, it is not necessary to understand this film.<br />The DVD also contains many extras, including scenes removed from the original film, multiple interviews, various interactive games, and much more.  For anyone looking for a fun movie to be enjoyed by the whole family, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a delightful film full of magic, friendship and an adventure that will keep audiences coming back for more!<br />Scott Kolecki
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I always look forward to new music from Sarah - but the wait on this one wasn't worth it.  It is mostly all ballads - not one of the songs, except Fallen, really sounds special - usually Sarah stretches things musically - but not here.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|There's nothing I love more than finding a great new voice. The first few chords of &quot;Follow Through&quot; hit me like a mack truck. I caught the video at about 2 am one night, and my first thought was &quot;Wow, who slapped Jason Mraz with a healthy helping of soul?&quot; Learning that this promising young voice came from the lips of a young man named Gavin DeGraw sent me on a mission: to find anything and everything he'd done, and pass it on to anyone who would listen.<br />&quot;Chariot&quot; is the single most impressive debut I've ever heard (and this coming on the heels of Maroon 5's wonderful &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;.) I recently caught both acts together at the House of Blues, and while Maroon put on an impressive show (as always), I was simply awestruck by Mr. DeGraw. His voice has raw passion and soul, and he has a wonderful stage presence. He has a way with words that's refreshing, amidst all of the male singer/songwriters trying to follow in John Mayer's footsteps. You really get the sense that he has a true love of music. His debut album is soulful, original, and personal. Songs like &quot;Belief&quot;, &quot;I Don't Want to Be&quot;, &quot;Follow Through&quot;, &quot;More Than Anyone&quot; (my personal favorite), and the title track let you lose yourself completely in the melody. The album is strongly piano-driven, and beautifully performed. And &quot;Chemical Party&quot; must be heard live to be truly appreciated. :) But this isn't a &quot;skip around&quot; record - being able to listen to an entire album, all the way through, is a rare treat these days, and &quot;Chariot&quot; gives you that gift. Gavin DeGraw's made a fan for life.
B000007T2Z|5.0|Every 5 star review of this album's got it right, it's a masterpiece.  Everything good has all been said before, but yesterday as i was getting ready for another long day of work, i had this album playing and providence started to pick up its pace and i turned up the stereo really really loud.  The drums came in, simply amazing, and i couldn't help but do a sort of vibrating dancing thing, tears dripped down my face, it was the greatest spiritual trance i've ever experienced.  GYBE truely know what they are doing, and in the best kind of way.  I wish I was in a band like this, it would be my religion, i would cry in joy at every show, the music is so powerful.  Check it out!  (btw, this album is my favorite of all GYBE's stuff, but all of their songs are worth owning.)
B00005JKC3|5.0|This is a love it or hate it film. Which is why you'll see either a one star or a five star rating. Those that give this film a bad review, I hate to say, just didn't get it. Most movie goers in America just don't understand these types of movies. Genius German director Werner Herzog criticized American audiences for this same reason. Most people went in to see this film thinking it's going to be another corny, up beat, action and humor packed Summer feel-good Superhero film. They were in for a surprise. This film was NOTHING like Spider Man, X-Men, the heinously awful Daredevil, or even the blasphemous marriage of Vampire and &quot;Action-Film&quot; of Blade. This is a deep, dark, introspective psychological drama. If you can't appreciate anything but intense brainless action, the corny humor that ruins most American films, and you wanted a 15 foot green giant to look &quot;real&quot;, than I have news for you... this film is for those of us that can and do appreciate true art. This is the Comic book film for the thinking man and the Artist. However, the action that does take place is breath taking and TASTEFULLY used. Not overused like every other film out there. This is a dramatic, Freudian Monster move. Not a Superhero move at all. If you think it needed more action, and more humor, go satisfy yourself with a tasteless, brainless American cookie cutter movie. <br />   In regards to the story, it may be different than the comic because nuclear bombs and desert test sites aren't exactly &quot;current&quot; issues anymore. Genetic research is on the other hand. The rest of the liberties taken with the story aren't really any farther removed than the Bixby/Ferigno TV series. I am a huge fan of the Comic, the series, and yes, this film. I can appreciate each, differences and all, for what they are. <br />   As far as the special effects... were you really expecting a GREEN skinned, 15 foot giant to look as real as LIFE? Even in real life the Hulk would look about assurreal as a snowman in the desert. In fact the CGI effects are wonderful. The Hulk is alive. He breathes, moves, and expresses himself like a living being. Even his VEINS throb! By far the most advanced CGI FX to date. Gollumn, who was small and withered will obviously look a bit more believable than a green colored behemoth. It really doesn't take THAT much imagination to believe in the Hulk when you watch this film. The FX are truly that good. I wish I could say the same for the Matrix films, The Mummy, the American Godzilla travesty, and even Spiderman (which I still liked). The split screens and off the wall cinematography is a wet dream to a film buff. I've never seen anything like it before in any film. Again, it's obvious why it would be annoying to some people who just don't get it. Film is supposed to be more than entertainment. It's Art. <br />   I'm very pleased with the DVD release. The vast amount of extras included are priceless. The only problem is how you can't skip out of the previews at the beginning of the dvd. That was a little unkind of Universal. Oh well, just a minor problem. <br />   Is this a good movie? Yes... a great film? Absolutely
B00005JKDR|5.0|When you are young children's mother or father you usually have to see lots of films that you'll never try any other way. But, unexpectecly, sometimes, a few, the film is an extrordinary masterpiece for adults. Children may laugh about 10 or 20 sketches, but if you are an adult you may laugh about 100 or 200 real funny ideas! Recently we found it in \\"Shrek\\" or in Pixar's Monsters Inc., good for kids... but much better for adults! <br />Monsters Inc. is fourth full-lenght Pixar's film. After the masterpieces \\"Toy Story\\", \\"A Bug's Life\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\". All Pixar's films are made completely by computers, but the ideas came from an extraordinary talented human group, headed by John Lasseter.<br />The main characters are: James P. Sullivan \\"Sullie\\", a big horned blue monster, the most frightening one but with an extraordinary heart; Mike Wazowsky, a funny one-eyed little green monster, his best friend; an Randall, a black-hearted reptil, a jealous cheater.<br />Monsters live in their own world, but they need energy that they obtain from children's shouts. Then they need to enter through the ward-robe door to the child's room, scare him and obtain energy.<br />But monsters think that children are dangerous and infectious, if a child touches you you'll probably die. But Boo, a 2-3 years old girl, gets into the monster's world because she thinks that Sullie is a big nice kitty.<br />Don't think twice! Rent a video! Buy a DVD! Whatever you want... but don't miss this extraordinary \\"adult\\" masterpiece.
B000005J56|5.0|I found the CD a wonderful diversion fom the mundane. I played it at work and many of my friends were curious as to where I found such a treasure. I would recommend this production to others.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Chihiro is a ten year old girl who, along with her parents, are moving and are on their way to their new home. Needless to say, she is very unhappy about it.<br />Along the way they cross over into the spirit world, via an abandoned theme park, and Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. She has somehow landed in this strange world, a world invisible to humans.<br />The only way that Chihiro can change them back, and not be transformed into an animal herself, is if she gets work from Yubaba. Yubaba is the mistress of the bathhouse and is very strict, though not as bad as she seems.<br />Chihiro gets a job at the bathhouse and her name changed to Sen. She is helped by a boy named Haku and an old man that works in the boiler room named Kamajii.<br />I loved all the characters and all the Japanese Gods that Miyazaki created. The animation is eye-catching and beautiful. I especially loved the little susuwatari (or dust bunnies) and the cute creature that Bou is transformed into.<br />The story is also captivating as you get drawn into Chihiro's struggle and her blossoming relationship with Haku. Chihiro's character grows as she must learn to rely on herself and her own strengths. Eventually she must come up against Yubaba to reclaim her name and return her parents to their human form.<br />I loved Spirited Away, as you can tell, as well as Miyazaki's other movie's like, My Neighbor Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service. He knows how to bring a story to life and make an animated movie for ten year olds-to people of any age.
B000001EMW|5.0|I've played the cello for 9 years, but I never knew that a cello could sound that awesome! Apocalyptica really changes the whole stereotype that cello's are boring, &quot;orchestra&quot; instruments. This brings a whole new touch to cellos, and music, and it sounds INCREDIBLE together!!!
0140277447|1.0|I cannot imagine why so many people believe this kind of bulls--t.<BR>We should always remember that a huge number of Chinese killed by Chienese Communist Party.They have to make a story up for diverting people's complaint.Japan is always the best target for them.They don't take objections much.Some Japanese even gradly accept it and throw themselves at a Chinese feet.This kind of hypocrites maybe regard themselves as better person by doing that.<BR>Iris Chang is a big liar but I don't brame her.She is working very hard for her country.
B00009V7OL|2.0|This DVD was transfered in a &quot;letterbox&quot; format. In my opinion the result was a VHS LIKE picture quality which was very disapointing. This is the kind of classic special effect extravaganza that deserves way better quality picture and that is what you get when a dvd is transfered in a anamorphic process. This dvd wasn't done properly and the result is a far lower quality picture than I was hoping for. Also disapointing was the fact it doesn't state that it is a &quot;letterbox&quot; presentation. My mistake was buying it without looking here on amazon first toi find out. In my experience, 99.9% of dvds that are non-anamorphic result in a way lower quality of picture.However, this dvd does have alot of extras that will make the hardcore &quot;Abyss&quot; fan happy. The 5.1 audio transfer was very good however it would've been better in DTS.I loved this movie and hope that when or if it is re-released they do it in a anamorphic format to drastically improve the picture quality. On any standard tv the picture quality would be ok but I have a 65in. widescreen tv and even with a progressive dvd player the picture exhibits alot of elements and pixelzation resulting in color loss and a crisp clean presentation. For those that don't understand &quot;anamorphic&quot;, when viewing on a standard tv it will be just the black bars at top and bottom, meaning &quot;letterbox&quot;. On any projection tv, big screen tv, or especially a widescreen projection television, the letterbox non-anamorphic dvd makes it so the viewer has to &quot;zoom&quot; in to see it correctly, thus resulting in seeing more of the quality of transfer.When in an anamorphic process, the viewer with a large projection tv has the picture automatically set for normal viewing without having to adjust the picture to fit the screen. Thuhs resulting in a better picture transfer for the dvd itself and for the complete presentation. &quot;Letterbox&quot; versions in my opinion are as good (bad) as watchingit on a VHS tape like quality picture.Anyways, although this dvd had great features and it is a great movie, the dvd in my opinion is not that great due to the picture quality. But, it is ok enough to watch and not as horrible as alot of other dvds I have seen transfered non-anamorphic. I guess it's worth buying if you can't wait and are a hardcore fan of the movie.If you can wait, I'd find the widescreen vhs tape instead for a cheaper price and get almost the same picture quality if you have a super-vhs player.
B00005JM02|1.0|I know fans will be upset, but hear me out.<br />There's something fishy here ... how has this become the most beloved of pixar movies when it is clearly the worst? The story stinks worse than a fish market - a father loses his wife and kids, all except one, which he then smothers. The kid goes out on an adventure, is caught, and dad fights to reunite them. The cookie-cutter plot is made worse by the dullest of the pixar characters so far, and there's so many of them that no time is given to any of them so they're not fished ... er ... fleshed out. What is Dora's background? Why does Bruce the shark not want to eat fish anymore? Do we see Marlon's response to losing his wife? Maybe a need for revenge? And what about all the fish in the fishtank? They're just tossed in for one-liners, with no depth at all. None of these fishy characters hooked me in. Where's the chutzpah and self-reference that made all the other pixar movies so spectacular? The sense of humor has become homogenized and this reeks of a bad Disney production. There is nothing cutting edge. Nothing pushing the envelope. It's corporate fodder. And where are the outtakes? If the thinking was, \\"we've done it to death,\\" you haven't! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The this clearly a case of more Hollywood people becoming so powerful they don't have to try anymore (even if these guys do live in Emeryville.) They should be ashamed at this lackluster effort, but while people buy it at the record-breaking rate they've bought this DVD, they'll continue to make flaccid movies like this. Mediocrity wins again. (Note that a few days after its release, there are 75 used copies on sale at half price! It ain't a coincidence!)<br />Monsters, Inc. rules! The ending made me cry, every one of the five times I saw it. The ending was welcome relief to Finding Nemo.
B000002A46|1.0|Well, Miss Carey, the only song i like on this album is &quot;O Holy Night&quot; Celine Also Did Better. Merry Christmas Mariah.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Revolutions is a vast improvement on Reloaded. Sure, its not as good as the original, and the dialogue didn't tax the scriptwriters, BUT the special effects are fantastic, the fight scenes are tremendous, and it makes a pretty damn good attempt on making sense out the muddle left by Reloaded. <br />I think a lot of people writing negative comments about this film are expecting some mind-blowing, life-changing relevation when they go to see it. Don't. Just enjoy - its a film!
0385504209|5.0|Ever since I read a review about this book in PEOPLE Magazine, I have been dying to read it.  Now I know why- it has every interesting aspect any good novel should have tied into it: history, mystery, suspense, intellect, intriguing characters, and unfathomable reality connections.  Dan Brown's wonderful, hands-down performance tangles the reader into the temporary discipleship web he has spun of the forgotten faith mentioned throughout the book.  Excellent character foils double to represent the timeline generations of the Church and to create inticing reading.<br />Many times while reading this book, I found myself racing to and from the computer to check on facts created in this novel, which were very true, as far fetched as they may seem.  The Da Vinci code not only opened my eyes to a world I never imagined could exist but reminded me that all things have ulterior motives.<br />Bottom line:  At the final page, I found myself secretly wishing a second catastrophe would uprise so that the adventure could continue.
0385504209|5.0|I'm not a big fan of &quot;thrillers,&quot; but this was recommended to me, so I decided to take a look. I loved it! Dan Brown's work is more than just a conventional thriller; it also provides a bit of history and gives some interesting insight to our perceptions of theology. I'll second that recommendation - I couldn't put it down. Dan Brown really did his homework with this one, and I look forward to reading his next work. Sneeble! Sneeble. Snarble. Snibble, snooble, snib. Bleeble! Blarble. Blibble, blooble, blib. Neeble, narble, nooble, nerble, nabble, nubble, nerp! Blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blurp.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I wasn't sure how this album would sound, with chris cornell on vocals, but when I listened; I was pleasantly surprised with the distinctive sound that the band has created with cornell. This sounds a bit like RATM, but really not that much. Obviously, it's going to sound a bit like RATM when you have the same band, but cornell is so different from zach de la rocha that it makes it a completely different band. With zach, it was all about politics and rapping; with cornell, there aren't any political messages and he never raps. I love RATM and Audioslave.
B00000IAU3|4.0|'No Angel' was more than a promising debut. Most of us felt like: &quot;What was that?&quot; without a sense of what had &quot;hit&quot; us when the first chords of &quot;Thank You&quot; began to air back in late 2000, almost two years after the album first came out in the UK, under the vigilante eye of her brother Rollo (Faithless).<br />Now, in perspective, after the release of her recent &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, this album feels like a promising debut where she was finding her true sound, opening up like a powerful Beth Orton, but closing up sounding a bit more commercial, along the lines of Sarah McLachlan. Most of the tracks have an overall downbeat sound, leaving behind a mellow sense of longing. Though extremely popular (even more so, after Eminem sent it out the roof), &quot;Thank You&quot; is not close to being the best track in the album. That privilege is left to the ballads &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; and &quot;All You Want&quot;, and the opening &quot;Here With Me&quot; which breaks the ice of her until-then musical anonimity in great shape.<br />In short, far from a shortcoming, but not as well crafted as her sophomore album, &quot;Life for Rent&quot;.
B00006V9A0|3.0|The only strength that this album has is the unreleased song &quot;you know you're right.&quot; That's the only reason I give it three stars; because it's one of my favorite Nirvana songs. Aside from the one new track,(instead of many many more - courtesy of courtney love)this album is a bad greatest hits compilation. It doesn't include many of Nirvana's best material plus it's fifteen dollars for one f#%&amp;in' song. If you have all of the Nirvana albums, then just download &quot;you know you're right&quot; and save your money.
B00008J4P5|4.0|It's been a while since I first heard 'Elephant' and given its continued success I decided to revisit it. I am even more fascinated by it, I confess. Detroit-based White brothers (Jack and Meg) manage to pull together a solid sound, in spite of the simpliciy of their production consisting of himself on guitar, vocals and occasional piano and Meg doing her job on the drums and singing here and there.<br />My first impression of them had put White Stripes in a similar line as contemporary acts The Vines and The Hives, with a somewhat post-punk sound. But behind the first impression there's a lot more. Jack's guitar brings to mind some scattered hints of influences from Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix, and more recently, Queen's Brian May and Jeff Buckley. Lyrics solidly complement the music, and round up the album as one filled with passion and a mission. The drumming provides a good frame to Jack's playing, though I could honestly spare some of the extensive splash cymbals.<br />This is definitely a band to keep an eye on, one of the most solid ones in the rock scene today, and the best of a recent wave of bands driven by a similar type of emotions and frustrations that brought the punk and grunge movements to life back in the late seventies and eightis, respectively.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is just perfect, there isn't a single bad song on it. &quot;fade to black&quot; is my favorite metallica song, the title track is awesome, &quot;creeping death,&quot; &quot;Call of the ktulu,&quot; need i say more? The only part of this disc that makes me angry is that the band still felt the need to jack Dave Mustaine's music (for those who don't know, Mustaine was the original lead guitar player in Metallica and remained in that position until about a week before they recorded &quot;Kill 'em All&quot;); two of the best songs on this album were written by Mustaine; &quot;ride the lightning&quot; and &quot;the call of ktulu.&quot; credit should be given when deserved.
B000089RVX|2.0|I love the Evanescence music, so, naturally I ran right out and bought the CD at Best Buy. I found, however, that my MP3 converter is useless with the band's copywrites. I do not own  CD player. I listen to my CDs on my MP3 player exclusively. Now what am I going to do??!!!
B00005JMFR|1.0|what a terrible movie, <BR>You have got to see Matrix Revolution. After which, you will have a better understanding and appreciation for money, time, and especially choice. If you are a pessimist, after the movie, you will worry about self-worth, if you are an optimist, you will become a pessimist. Ask yourself, could it be worse?<br />p.s. don't listen to what people are saying, all you have to do is believe.
0385504209|2.0|Davinci Code didn't live up to the hype, at least not for me. If I hadn't been expecting so much maybe would have been 3 stars.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Okay, I would like to add something to the first review on the digipak menu. Yes, Mudvayne is good, but I very much disagree to the thought that they are better. And to insult Corey, you're wrong. Corey Taylor is one of the few who actually sounds good screaming WHILE jumping around and fighting on stage. Do you see Kud headbanging while screaming? No. But don't get me wrong, Mudvayne is my 2nd favorite band, and I have posters and every DVD/Video/CD they have in my room. Ru-d with his Warwick Thumb Bass, now there is a bassist. Slipknot's Paul Gray cannot compare with Ru-d's skills. <br />Here is what I have to say.<br />Scissors, at the end, at exactly 13:24 seconds, a conversation starts. Slipknot is watching a Por** that is very dirty, just to make fun of it. The person throwing up in the background is Chris. You can tell when Corey says, &quot;Chris, look at this, Chris Chris! Look at this! It's nasty!&quot; Chris says &quot;I can't&quot;, and throws up some more. <br />The hidden track is called Eeyore. This is the heaviest song Slipknot has ever done on their first album. There are heavier songs on Iowa. Eeyore is about a Long Haired Blonde back in Des Moines. He absolutely loves Slipknot, but he treats girls like crap and hits them and stuff like that. The Song is about Corey just tearing him to shreds, and beating the living H-E-L-L out of this guy.<br />The Spit It Out after Scissors is the Hyper Version. This is an old version that was recorded with Sean McMahon back in their early careers, about two months after they got Corey. Despise, Interloper, and Get This are SO FREAKIN' GOOD! THESE SHOULD BE REGULAR SONGS ON THE REGULAR ALBUM, JUST LIKE EEYORE SHOULD!!! THEY SONGS ARE UNBELIEVABLE!!! IF YOU DON'T LIKE GET THIS, YOU ARE NOTHING!!!!!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Although it didn't get much play at the theater, Zoolander has become one of the top cult classics in just a few short years. The reason is simple - Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These two together have never missed and Zoolander is no exception. Both have managed to create very deep and memorable characters that you will be quoting for years. This is one of those movies that's just full of lines from beginning to end. <br />I highly recommend this film to anyone - yeah, it's a little stupid, but that's the point of it. Even Will Ferrell couldn't steal this one. If you buy it, it's one of those you'll throw in every few weeks to get a fresh dose of Hansel, Derek and Mugatu.
0156027321|4.0|Don't let the title of this Booker Prize-winning novel fool you, it has nothing to do with the history of Greek tagmemics or the saga of the circle's circumference. Life of Pi is in no way that undemanding or elementary.  In fact, the author states upfront that this is a book that will make the reader believe in God.<BR> The first part of the story introduces us to Piscine Molitor Patel, named after a Parisian swimming pool; he re-christens himself \\"Pi\\" in order to avoid the juvenile torment of his name's unfortunate likeness to bodily excretion.  Pi is the earnest, bookish son of an austere zookeeper in Pondicherry, India, a former French colony.  Being raised in the zoo, Pi maintains a resounding wealth of knowledge regarding the facets of animal biology and behavior.  He imparts his knowledge with a fierce oratorical quality, diffusing a practical wisdom of the realities of animal life, captive and wild, into an exquisite exoneration of the zoo as an establishment. But as he matures, Pi's interest soon shifts to that of the metaphysical world.<BR> He encounters each of the dominant religions in Pondicherry, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism, with a raw sense of awe, unabashedly becomes a fervent worshipper of all three faiths.  It is not long before the priest, the imam, and the pandit discover Pi's participation with the other religions.  They confront his parents, and a brazen fight takes place as the holy men vie for Pi's loyalty, initiating an amusing scene where each holy man belittles the other's faith, painting a vivid portrait of the simplicity and spitefulness yielded by many religious leaders.  Pi rails against the bickering clerics, \\"I was just trying to love God.\\"<BR> Due to financial troubles in India and the promise of a new life abroad, Pi's family makes plans to immigrate to Canada.  With an assortment of animals in tow, they board a Japanese tanker and head for North America.  <BR>Part two opens frankly: \\"the ship sank.\\"  In a whirlwind of events,Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a very unlikely set of guests:  an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and a 500-pound Bengal tiger named Richer Parker.  The first week adrift at sea is horrific as the food chain recoils, snapping one link at the time.  Martel's storytelling and illustrative language paint a vivid and macabre picture that is exciting and enthralling, despite its sanguinary language. What follows is an electrifying account of the 227 days in which Richard Parker and Pi remain at sea.  The young boy is pit against nature with only his wit, will, and convictions as tools.<BR> Those who revile the maritime adventures of freshman English classes, tortured by Old Man and the Sea and Moby Dick with their tedious yarn, should not be so quick to discount this tale as the same monotonous shibboleth.  The prose moves at a deafening pace with fresh and glorious accounts of the wonders of nature and the deep vaults of the mind.  The story is intoxicating and sharp, not at all like those \\"other\\" sea-bound fables.  There's no whale and his fishing line doesn't snap.<BR> When the lifeboat finally arrives onshore, Pi meets with two Japanese insurance agents who listen to the survivor's story with stony distrust.  It is then that Pi tells quite a different story.  Martel challenges the reader to confront his own experience alongside Pi and decide which of the two stories is true.  It becomes a matter of faith in the impossible, illogical, and inspiring.<BR> Yann Martel's masterpiece of fiction, philosophy, and zoology provokes the reader on a level that is far too rare in literature.  Life of Pi attempts to blur the man-made boundaries between freedom and captivity, simple and wise, good and evil, truth and fiction, God and religion.  The novel consists of innumerable layers of allegory that reward the reader with each brave new step that he must make in order to understand the work, and through it, himself.  <br />\\"Evil from the open is but evil from within that's been let out.  The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.\\"
B000000WFZ|4.0|I really think that &quot;The Mission&quot; is one of the most important works by Ennio Morricone.  Important in the sense that the Italian maestro presents us a work of strange beauty, especially with the London Voices chanting the Latin words in the opening cue 'On Earth As It Is In Heaven', a wonderful and powerful piece that fits perfectly in the marvelous landscapes surrounding the Iguazu Falls and the Indians who inhabitted it during the Spanish colonial settlements in the age of the discovery of the New World.<br />Beneath the chanting and the ethnic percussion, the theme for Padre Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) is heard.  A lovely composition played on the flute on that opening track, and later played on oboe in the prettiest representation of the theme in the two versions of 'Gabriel's Oboe'.<br />The theme for &quot;The Mission&quot; is also truly spectacular and it's heard in the shots of the falls.<br />In spite of other attractive choral moments like 'Ave Maria Guarani', there is something that bothers me about this CD, and it's the overabundance of dark motives that foreshadow the final tragic moment of the film.  Tracks such as 'Penance', 'Alone', 'Guarani', and 'The Sword' make me feel gloomy every time I listen to the album.<br />I wish there had been a good balance between the glorious and the dark moments in &quot;The Mission&quot;, but I have to admit that Ennio Morricone created one interesting and experimental score.
0688163173|3.0|After reading Mystic River, I thought that anything written by Lehane would be pure gold.  However, Shutter Island proved this idea to be very wrong.  This story reminded me of so many Dean Koontz novels where the characters and writing were superb, yet the actual storyline falls apart.  The tale seemed to try and be so convouluted and cofusing, that by the middle of the book I couldn't wait to get to the very predictable ending.  Lehane is very talented and I hope will go on to provide us with many more masterpieces like Mytic River.  Still... this one does not live up to the standards set by his previous novels.
1573229725|1.0|I'm sorry but I have to disagree with many of the other reviewers of this book. It's taken me a long time to read (3wks) because my interest in it has been waning. In my view the narrative is at times turgid and flawed, dialogue implausible and the description is lacking. The few bits of heightened tension are when the two main characters have a 'liaison' whilst letting on to each other next morning that they were asleep. Also, when one of the key characters is killed. For such a fat volume there's not much going on that couldn't be tailored neatly into 100 pages. Dickensian it is not. Read this and then read anything from Dickens and then you'll realise the difference is like walking from the night into day. You get the impression that the author herself got bored with the process of writing it and only livened up at the start and towards the end of the book.
B000002NHN|5.0|I was introducted to McKennitt when I heard &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; remix air on the radio. I immediately went out and bought the CD. &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is beautiful. When I'm feeling nostalgic, this song makes me cry. That and &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, originally written by poet Alfred Noyes, are my two favourites on this album. McKennitt does a wonderful job of putting classic poems to song. I also recommend that you listen to &quot;The Stolen Child&quot; originally written by W.B. Yeats.<br />No matter what she does, McKennitt will blow your socks off.
0446608955|5.0|In Nicholas Spark's novel A Walk to Remember, the main point is that life is too short to not live your life like you want to live it.  Accidents happen or you may get stuck with a sickness that can not be cured, and you can not do anything about it.  You just have to live life with a positive attitude and live as normally as possible.<br /> Landon Carter hangs out with the popular crowd at his high school.  He has no worries, no cares, and he just lives one day at a time taking life for granted. Landon gets in some trouble and has to help out at school more than he would like. He also has to act in a school play. Doing these things he gets to know who Jamie Sullivan really is. Jamie is the girl that Landon and all of his buddies make fun of at school, she is a girl that Landon would never think about being with if he did not have to spend time with her.  But they do start spending time together because Jamie is in the play with Landon, and he really gets to know her.  Then he starts to like her.  After Landon falls in love with Jamie, she is forced into telling him that she has cancer.  She has a list of all the things she wants to do before her life is over, and Landon tries his best to make all of her wishes come true.  They get married, but only a short time later Jamie dies, leaving Landon Carter's life changed forever.<br /> Spark's wrote this book for an audience made of mostly teen girls and women. But anyone could read this book.  The love that Landon has for Jamie would make anyone feel good.  The love brings together two teens from different lifestyles, with different goals, and different outlooks on life.  It seemed as if Landon was put in Jamie's life for a reason, and she knew that he was sent especially to her. Even though Jamie's life was short, she had everything she wanted because of Landon.<br /> I loved reading A Walk to Remember.  It was such a good book because anyone can relate to it.  There have been many instances when I have seen that lifeis short.  Everyone should try to live there life like Jamie did.  If something is wrong, don't let it get the best of you. No one in Jamie's school even knew that Jamie has cancer because she did not dwell on it.  She did the same things that she would have done even if she was not sick.
B000069HKH|5.0|I bought this album last year and only now have I decided to write a review on it.  And what can I say?  Its one of the greatest albums Ive ever heard.  So much healing, emotion, power, angst, and happiness comes from this album.  Bruce Springsteen is without a doubt the greatest song writer out there today.  This album is 15 works of art rolled into one.  Each song is clear, each is emotional, each has its own inspirational power to it that not only capture the mind but the heart and spirit as well....<BR>                          The songs...<BR>1. Lonesome Day .... 4.5/5...Incredible way to start and incredible album...it starts off the album with a bang<br />2. Into the Fire....5/5...Heartfelt clear reference to 9/11...one of the six 5/5's that i rated on this album...incredible tribute to firefighters everywhere<br />3.  Waitin on a Sunny Day...5/5....The next 5/5 was just as good as the one that came before it.  Springsteen is the only artist i know of who can make such a simple line like &quot;Waitin on a Sunny Day..Gonna chase the clouds away &quot;  and turn it into a masterpiece of a song.  <br />4.  Nothing Man..4.5/5...Very hearfelt personal song of Bruce's about trying to cope with life after a tradgedy.  This song is good after any type of tough time...not just 9/11<br />5. Countin on a Miracle...4/5...This is a rocker but the &quot; Countin on a Miralce &quot; line at the end kinda gets monotnous.  But besides that this a great song to just chill out with and hear vintage Bruce Springsteen.<br />6.  Empty Sky..4/5...This would have definately been a 5/5 if it was a minute longer.  It ends to quickly.  This is such an incredible song I dont know why Bruce stopped to soon with it.  But it is a fantastic view of how life can change so quickly. <br />7.  World's Apart...5/5..Here it is! The king of all songs on this album.  By far the most powerful, driving, and controversial of all on here.  It speaks of an American falling in love with an Iraqui.  Listen to the tormented guitar solo at the end and the all Iraqui choir chanting haunting tunes throughout the air of this song. <br />8.  Lets be Friends ( Skin to Skin ) ... 4/5...Very fun catchy song.  Just a simple catchy tune with a good beat and fun lyrics.  Good party song.  Clarence soars on the sax in this one.<br />9.  Further On Up the Road ... 5/5 ... This is 5/5 number four. Its almost as hard and driving as Worlds Apart.  This was another one that was too short but this one was SO good i had to give it 5/5 anyway.  Its just an all around kick ass song.  <br />10. The Fuse...4/5...Out of all songs on this album this was my least favorite and at that its still a 4/5.  I didnt think Bruce needed to go so techno for this one.  If he had kept just organic instruments it would have been alot better.  But its still a good song about a lustfull romance.  <br />11. Mary's Place...4.5/5...Great fun song!  The most fun song on the album.  Bruce brings back his boardwalk days with this baby and it pays off.  Once again Clarence soars on the saxaphone.  If you listen close to the lyrics you will realize that its not as fun as the music makes it sound.  <br />12. You're Missing...5/5...The most heartfelt of all songs here and the second best.  This is the saddest song Bruce has ever done.  It will send chills up your spine numerous times.  It speaks of a family coping with the loss of a loved one and how evrerything seems the same except for the absence of that person. <br />13. The Rising...4.5/5..So close to being the sevent 5/5 but it was just way to overplayed on the radio.  Still its an incredible song.  And it features some of the best lyrics that &quot; The Boss &quot; has got to offer.  It is an excellent choice for the first single.  Once it starts, the power does not stop. <br />14.  Paradise..5/5..The last of the six 5/5s on this album.  Paradise is a very sad, somber song that seems to just bring you to a different place.  A place full of eternal abyss and seperation.  It all tells about a near death experience and the way it feels to come out of it.  <br />15.  My City's in Ruins....4.5/5...This is a truly great song.  Very simple and easy going..but the words live on well after you finish this album.  Without a question the best song to end the album with.  <br />The Rising is a work of art.  These songs are the best Bruce has ever offered.  This will go down as a classic in years to come and when it does I'll still be listening to it with as much awe and wonder as i do now.
0446608955|5.0|The book that I read was entitled \\"A Walk to Remember\\" written by Nicholas Sparks.  It is a book that really touches the heart and makes you feel good all over.  This book is about two adolescent teens who are trying to make the best off life.  The boy, Landon Carter, is wild and ambitious teenager who gets into some trouble with police department after he get caught trespassing.  He is sentenced to complete community service with younger children with learning disabilities.  Also as part of his punishment he must participate in the high school play.  There he is casted as the leading role and then starts to notice a young lady who is somewhat plainer and more to herself.  She is the only child of the preacher and doesn't hand out with the \\"cool\\" kids.  Her name is Jamie.  As time goes on and they spend more time together Landon falls for Jamie Sullivan.  He realizes that love is more important popularity.  He falls more and more, the whole time Jamie is hiding a deep secret from Landon.  Finally Jamie admits to Landon that she is dying of Leukemia.  Landon gives Jamie the wedding that she always dreamed of, but in the end Jamie passes on, but in her short life she has managed to turn the life of Landon around and he goes on to succeed in life.  As Landon goes on he always hold a special place in his heart for his one true love.  I give this book a wonderful review.  It was definitely what I would call a real \\"tear-jerker.\\"  I would greatly recommend this book to anyone wanting to appreciate the gift of life and the wonderful people you know though out it.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|I keep seeing references to WORLDWIDE UNDERGORUND as an \\"album\\". The length and # of tracks may be misleading, but this is just an EP- NOT the proper followup to MAMA'S GUN. As a result, I see Erykah here, just kickin' back, letting things run loose...<br />Do they run too loose? Of course! Is this work a little self-indulgent? You bet! She isnt working under the normal constraints...I derived greater pleasure from this CD by viewing, not so much as the landmark followup to 2 brilliant CD's by a master artist, but rather as cool outtakes and asides from a master artist, not feeling the pressure of creating something thats gonna change the world...<br />yeah, some of it is a little monotonous, and at times, the lyrics seem somewhat uninspired, but for me, the set finds Badu in a relaxed mood, shooting left and right, and enjoying herself. I mean, do we understand what the lyrics to DANGER are about? If you do, then you understand why this CD is not to be taken all THAT seriously... <br />There are some serious beats and grooves here, and yes...i admit it...i LOVE the LOVE OF MY LIFE remix- those are some INSPIRED guest appearances (Bahamadia!), as is Roy Hargroves' dreamy horn solo on THINK TWICE. <br />In conclusion- yes, it has weaknesses, but I can say this- it is essentially Badu on vacation, and its still leaps and bounds ahead of most of the other CD's that I purchased this year...and those other artists had put out REAL, actual, proper albums...
B00005JKC3|5.0|Hulk is a Masterpiece! Ang Lee once again proves to be a great director! Hulk is a motion picture with perfect graphics, and powerhouse performances by Eric Bana and Nick Nolte. Besides X-men 2 this is the best movie of the year. Please don't listen to the people that say that this is a boring movie, because the character development is key to understanding the characters and the plot. The fight scenes are amazing as are the chasing scenes.    This movie makes Daredevil look pathetic. Daredevil IS pathetic!    The Hulk is one of the years Best, buy it as soon as possible, it is a must have in your DVD collection!!! Don't listen to those who think it is boring!!! The HULK is great!
B00005JMFR|4.0|Seen the movie twice now, and was rocked both times. Don't listen to those bad reviews! They were written by die hard fans who demanded perfection and answers from the Wachowskis and got all sulky when they didn't get it. This movie ain't perfect; the first half an hour is disconcerting as it continues the reloaded storyline without a pause, and it's a bit slow and ponderous. However the rest of the movie is full of scenes to gasp at, poignant moments stuck in between the action, and a suitably thunderous and clever ending. OK so there's probably going to be a sequel, they certainly left room for it, but as far as I'm concerned it's all good! Overall it ain't as good as the first movie, better than the second, but most importantly makes you care again. Go and see it!
B00005JLXE|1.0|The worst Superhero movie EVER! Ben Affleck can't act, neither can Jennifer Garner. BAD Graphics and directing. Don't waste your time!!!! Buy The Hulk instead!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|It seems like the band as a whole didn't try hard enough with this one. That, combined with the fact that Maiden albums are turning into Steve Harris Solo Albums is not a good combination. When I frist heard Brave New World, I was amazed and it defintely lived up to my expectations. Another huge negative point is sound quality!! (Steve's basement?) It seems Maiden could use a new producer and Co-producer. (NO STEVE HARRRIS). Also, we need to see the other band members writing more songs and more Adrian on guitar. Stay away from this one unless you aboslutely love Maiden!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Matrix Revolutions ends a series that is ground-breaking in story, theme, and special effects.  It's such a new style of entertainment, that film-makers are still scrambling to emulate the styles of the first two, and the third film will give them more work to do.  It's such a new style, that many people can't connect to, or understand it.  The themes involve carefully constructed religious and mythological symbolism, combined with an apocolyptic view of earth in the future.  The movie never fails to excite, but some thought might be required.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|If you ask me, this record is very similiar to the substance<BR>known to human beings as mustard.....you take it in, its really<BR>nice and then it gets really warm and hot and you spit it out....thats it. You cant take the sheer intensity of this record in one go...you have to put some away for later....its excellent.<BR>There are good songs on it like Between Love &amp; Hate and The Way It Is. If you dig this, you'll probably dig bands like Television,<BR>Bob Dylan and Booker T &amp; The MG's too. Enjoy my friends, because its not gonna be around forever.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix Triology will gown down in history as one of the best ever, if not the best to date.  Revolutions brought many of the themes in movies 1 and 2 together and brought to a proper close, but also left a hint that if so desired, the producers of this ground breaking epic could continue writing on.  I will be the first to admit that there is so much that could be explored about The Matrix universe in both film and book, but I am hoping that the  Wachowski brothers will allow this innovative trilogy to close on a high note.  And if persuaded to maybe write a few books that possibly continue the life of the Matrix.<br />DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH STAR WARS THOUGH.  PREQUELS AND SEQUELS WILL ONLY DETRACT FROM THE BENCHMARK THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE WACHOWSKI BROTHERS IN THIS GENRE.<br />BY THE DVD AND WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
B0000C9V3T|2.0|What the soundtrack to KILL BILL does best is point out what a great director Tarantino is.<br />The movie comes across as fast, furious, almost manic. When you listen to the soundtrack you realize all of that animation came from the visual swirl Tarantino put on the screen, because the music is generally atmospheric and decidedly downbeat. To some degree PULP FICTION worked on the opposite tack, with less action and a more uptempo soundtrack. I suppose the tension between the audio and visual tracks is part of the attraction of Tarantino films; I know it was worked to perfection in RESERVOIR DOGS, particularly during everyone's favorite Ear scene.<br />The \\"Kill Bill\\" soundtrack is more a curiousity than anything else. There isn't much thrill to driving your car while this is on, and you sure aren't going to dance to it. The whistled \\"Twisted Nerve\\" was perfect in the film but is just plain goofy when forced to stand on its own. The inclusion of Lucy Lu's speech at the council meeting is pointless; and the run through of some \\"Kung-Fu\\"-like sound effects is only fun the first time you hear it.<br />I love the 5.6.7.8's, but what on earth is this gibberish from 'The RZA'? I've only seen the movie once, but I don't recall \\"Ode To Oren Ishii\\", a three minute rant and rave about Lu's character. It's stupid (at one point he rhymes the word \\"off\\" with \\"off\\" and \\"off\\"....duh), it's annoying, neither rapped nor sung, just screamed by some guy with marbles in his mouth who can't open his yap without \\"Yo!\\" coming out at least once every sentence, and it doesn't fit with anything else on the CD. It's time to put an end to the obligitory nod to hip-hop on all soundtracks. It doesn't always work.<br />When it comes right down to it, I guess I don't much care for this soundtrack. It is incomplete, the sound quality isn't always up to snuff, and the inclusion of the RZA tracks is annoying. <br />It's my own fault, though. What I really want is KILL BILL on DVD, and I was too impatient to wait for it, so I bought what I thought might be the next closest thing. Ah well.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I think Sarah's new CD is excellent.  The songs all flow from one to another.  Yet, they don't all sounds exactly the same.  They fulfill my music hunger both when I am listening to music while trying to fall asleep, and while I want to listen to something interesting with nice lyrics.  I have not been a huge Sarah fan before - I have Surfacing and Mirrorball and like them both a lot, but found them both a while after they first came out.  This Afterglow though, I love and am not anticipating taking out of my CD player any time soon.
B00005JLZN|4.0|What this film attempted to illustrate was that a white person without a credible defence or a lot of money to save themselves could be hanged by circumstantial evidence within an environment that executes people - sorry to all you rednecks that think this film is a waste of time - but then again why am I apologising to people (!?!) who wouldn't even watch the film on general principles. People say that this film is a waste of time because it manipulates the events to cause the execution to occur - not a very good system if it is this easily tricked - or perhaps the system cannot be bothered to find the truth !!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This is one of the best movie ever in hollywood history. I've seen this movie sooo many time and every time i watch it it feels like I'm watching it for the 1st time. This movie bring back memories. Great sound track. Kate Hudson is just wonderful... I dont have any word to express my feelings about Kate. She is the godess. Watch this movie and you will see what I'm talking about. It's a MUST have movie.
6304698798|5.0|The Good The Bad The Ugly (il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo) (1966) ****1/2/*****<BR>Directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. This is one of my personal favorites, because of its excellent use of music, sets, widescreen and overall, just how entertaining of a movie it is. The characters and acting is top notch with the very memorable villain \\"Angel Eyes\\" played by, Lee Van Cleef. Although the plot may be slightly basic, everything else is brimming with originality and creativity. Highly recommended.<br />THE DVD:<BR>This is the only \\"Man With No Name\\" DVD that is anamorphic and boasts a good widescreen picture. Detail is good, there is not much digital artifacting to point out, but a new remaster is going around at this moment so expect a new DVD featuring improved picture and sound in the future. For 9 dollars CAD you cant go wrong with this classic in your collection.<br />Interesting Fact: Shot in the deserts of Spain with 1,500 Spanish Militiamen as extras.*<br />*Source IMDB
B00007KQG5|5.0|D. H. Lawrence's classic and erotic novel, \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\",is beautifully filmed and retold in this Ken Russell video production.<BR>   Lovely Joley Richardson plays Lady Constance Chatterley, in the title role, as a sexually and socially repressed young English woman in the early 1920's. She is married to Sir Clifford Chatterley, played by Michael Wilby,as a titled, WW1 British officer, whose war injuries have paralized him from the waist down.<BR>   We watch as Constance accepts her fate at first, and loyally looks after her demanding,upper-class husband. The isolation and Sir Clifford's constant need for care take its' toll, and soon Lady Chatterley's mental and physical health is in question. A nurse-companion, Mrs. Bolton, is hired from the local colliery town of Tevershall, thus relieving Connie of her duties, giving her more time to visit with her family members and,to go for long walks in the near-by woods. Soon, her wanderings cross paths with Sir Clifford's reclusive,irrasible,lowly bred game keeper, Oliver Mellors. <BR>   Actor Sean Bean, with his rakish and sensual \\"bad boy\\" good looks, plays Mellors with great intensity and honest passion. He is perfectly cast as the angry, down trodden man who finds new life and \\"the only freedom\\" he has ever known,in the love he shares with the independant, and equally passionate Lady Chatterley.<BR>   This adaptation follows the literary novel closely. (Please read the book, if you haven't already, as some of the warmly passionate and meaningful scenes have been left out for the sake of censorship and the movies length). The video \\"fleshes out\\" (pardon the pun!)the novel that features lots of dialogue in the book. The comparisons between priviliged and idealic country life, and the \\"blackened\\" buildings that serve as social \\"traps\\", rather than homes to the low-born class,gives one pause for thought, even 80 years later.Even Sir Clifford is able to gain our sympathies now and then,as he tries to control what little of his life he can, but in the end, he needs to rely on others.It was interesting to see the stories characters juxtaposed in front of the cathedral windows, or in the front doorway at Wragby Hall;a subtle way of letting the viewer know \\"who is in control now!\\".  <BR>   I highly recommend this video. Although this (surprisingly) un-rated BBC production aired on British TV (....and we think the Brits are \\"stuffy\\", not a chance!!!), it is not for the prudes or immature viewers among us! It is an honest and moving portrait of a love that conquers all!
0688163173|5.0|A great story. I could not put it down. Best fiction Ive read this year.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I expected so much from the build up of the first two movies, that Revolutions really let me down. Neo had a score to settle with the Frenchman and the Architect that was completely abandoned.  Neo's fate was left completely ambiguous.  Morpheous was reduced to being a navigator and Trinity's character deserved better.  Fans were really let down.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The &quot;Californication&quot; album by the Chili Peppers was by far their best album yet.  It is a universal album that will open you up into a new world of music.  One of the best things about Californication is that it was the come back album of John Frusiante.  After being away from the band for a few years and cleaning his life up after his drug addiction he once again shows off he god-given talent.  He has his own style that is unmatched in all senses.  With his return the band has become closer, stronger, and more powerful then ever.  Now with their follow up album &quot;By The Way&quot; they are showing the world that they are as strong as ever and &quot;Californication&quot; will always be a phenomenon in itself.
0064407667|2.0|I agree with previous reviewers that these books, while engaging enough to read in one sitting, are quite off-putting.  I find the author's tendency to define words annoying.  I will, however, admit that I get a certain amusement from the tongue-in-cheek, understated, British humor.  Granted, I am an adult with a child of my own, but I don't think I would have enjoyed this series as a kid.  The books have references that are way over the heads of the recommended reading level and very disconcerting for us adults.  Klaus and Sunny (von Bulow, perhaps?), I mean really!  Sure, Harry Potter has a dark side, but the dark side makes sense.  These books seem to be misery for misery's sake.  We have enough of that in this world, without promoting it in our pre-teen children.  Try reading the \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series, the \\"Chronicles of Narnia,\\" or even \\"The Hobbit.\\"  There's plenty of trouble in all of these, but plenty of fun, too.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I hate to call this a great family movie because of the connotations that term has acquired.  This is a very fine film for adults, kids, and teenagers.  Some make a great deal out of the &quot;girl power&quot; or feminist aspects of the story.  I don't see that as much as I see &quot;people power&quot;.  The hero of the story is a heroine.  She happens to be a girl in a dying male dominated Maori.  Her being a female excludes her - but it could have been anything that made her an outsider.  And this otherness blinds the grandfather to all her magnificent qualities.  And the blindness creates more hurt and loneliness than should be borne by anyone.  The young girl, Pai, has such strength that her ache is not a burden so much as it is a furnace that heats her passion for the sacred in her culture.  She will not stop or quit.  She cannot be discouraged by the hurt and pain in her life because she has never known anything else.  She demands her own place and her own life not be defeating anyone else, but by simply taking her own place without asking permission.  She becomes a source of strength and uplift for everyone else.<br />Pai's is a quiet determination.  She cannot be dominated, but she doesn't destroy that which rejects her.  She ignores that which rejects her while embracing and nourishing herself on the Maori legends.  She is just a magnificent person and the actress who plays her is superb.  Well, the whole cast is superb.  You will want to watch it with your whole family because of the strength of this child and the way it handles family pain.  It can spark some wonderful discussions.<br />The photography is beautiful and adds to the poetry and mystery of the story.  It is worth watching many times.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Summary:<BR>Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears to be a delusional schizophrenic with a number of other problems, including a potentially anti-social personality disorder. He is being visited, usually in daydreams or hallucinogenic states, by a disfigured rabbit named Frank (James Duval). Frank, who describes himself as a messenger from the future, tells Donnie to do certain things, including flooding and defacing his high school and burning down a local, motivational speaker's house (Patrick Swayze). <br />While experiencing these visits, Donnie is seeing a therapist (Katharine Ross), has fallen in love with the new girl in school (Jenna Malone), is having trouble with his parents (Eddie Darko - Holmes Osborne; Rose Darko - Mary McDonnell), and is having trouble at school. What all of these people surrounding Donnie don't know is that Frank has informed Donnie when the world is going to end. Donnie, meanwhile, begins exploring conceptual understandings about God and time travel in hopes of understanding what is happening to him. <br />The movie ends with Donnie realizing that he wasn't delusional, but that realization comes with a steep price.<br />Comments:<BR>Several friends highly recommended this movie, describing it as a dark 'mind trip' (though they used a slightly different word, if you get my drift). In some ways I would agree that this movie is, for the most part, a mind trip, but I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a film that has the potential to be a 'mind trip'. Though this movie is about as close as a movie can get to being a mind trip, I don't think it quite pulls it off. But the reason why is not because the story didn't have all the essential elements, but because the elements that would have given the story the necessary additional information to solidify the intrigue are cut from the final version of film. The result is a movie far more open to interpretation than I believe was originally intended. The movie is supposed to contrast divinity and insanity, but it doesn't quite get there without the deleted scenes and director's commentary. I don't understand why, in the DVD edition, a director's cut version is not an option. If it was offered, I don't think I could complain about this movie. <br />As far as the acting goes, Jake Gyllenhall is tremendous. Most of the rest of the cast is okay, but I found myself not caring that the supporting cast wasn't outstanding because Gyllenhall was so good.<br />Generally I also comment about the fluency and logic of the story, but my only concern with this film is that too much of the story was cut (see above).<br />Overall, I enjoyed the film, but I have a tendency to be critical of films that require additional commentary in order to be understood. I understand that some films are designed to be interpreted, but I don't think the degree of openness to interpretation in this film was intended. Sure,  the issues of God and time travel are left unresolved, but the I believe the writer/director had intentions to clarify the issues that were being raised but was forced to cut some of the scenes that would have done this. I think a good example of a movie that has enough substance to clearly raise an issue but not offer any answers is 'Eyes Wide Shut' (or pretty much any Kubrick film), though Kubrick was generally able to take as much time as was necessary to tell his story. Thus, my critique of the film is more of a disappointment; it had what was necessary to be a great film, but, sadly, elements that were necessary for achieving that end were cut when they shouldn't have been.  Though those elements are offered as special features on the DVD, they should have been reincorporated into the movie on the DVD - then the writer/director wouldn't be able to complain.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is an amazingly beautiful movie.  The story captures the flavor of a ten year old's life with its use of fantasy blended into reality.  Chihiro doesn't want to move, feels her parents don't understand or pay attention, and wishes she were somewhere else.  She ends up in a magical world full of strange and fantastic beings.  Of course, she ends up facing dangers and has an opportunity to become the hero, which teaches her more about herself and amazes everyone else.  It is a well done story.  I don't want to trivialize it by saying the plot points we know.  It is how those plot points are worked out that is fresh and inspiring.  The movie is peopled by characters that range from beautiful to frightening, from mundane to so weird you wonder about the mind that could conceive of such a thing.<br />The animation is the best yet from Studio Ghibli.  I simply was stunned by what I was seeing on the screen.  Where do you come up with creatures like these?  And where do you get the time and patience to draw such detailed and beautiful things.  I wish I could get prints of some of the images and hang them on my walls.<br />And while I love the movie a great deal, my kids loved it even more.  My own ten year old says it is the best movie ever.  What better endorsement is there than that?<br />There is also a very nice short on the making of the movie - especially bringing it to America including some of the cultural difficulties in translation. And I also enjoyed turning on the Japanese original voices and reading the English subtitles, which have some subtle differences in the dialogue from the dubbed English.<br />Just a great movie and a great disk.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Like everyone else, I'm dying to see Season 2.  But I must admit, my craving is losing its edge.  The more sugar you eat, the more you want.  But when you are deprived for long enough, your desire diminishes.  Hope it comes out soon!
B00005A46T|5.0|Sometimes, when no apologies are riding in my veins and I feel like I'm towering above the world, I like to look down and smile a power-tripping smile. When I find that feeling etching my face, I like to carry it further, taking my hand and meshing it with a hammer, a bat, or whatever else finds itself in my stead, and I like to break things. The feeling of tearing through something, rending it into pieces, is such an uplifting experience, making me feel like the king of the anthill for a time. Its almost like purification, release, and it does for me what many a medicinal treatment wouldn't accomplish. It makes me feel free. When I do this, I like to adopt a soundtrack for the moment, too, wearing my discman to complete the picture. And Slipknot's Iowa, whether metal &quot;purists&quot; agree or not, is part of that &quot;now&quot; for me.<br />Honestly, I've never understood the rift created between what people want to classify as &quot;nu-metal&quot; and what people want to classify as &quot;metal-metal.&quot; Sure, I can see it with some bands, but there are other products of rage and aggression, focusing their eyes on the dysfunctional disease called social order, and those groups sometimes have something to say. With this album Slipknot does that pretty well, taking the rage and the angst they simmered within on their last release and refining it, making something that is, in so many ways, attractive. Its heavy, its aggressive, and it takes many things from a newer breed of music, that of electronics, and couples them with metal. Some people can't accept that, however, wanting to live in a time capsule with their blessed sights and sounds. They can't listen to harmony and to growling sounds at the same time, perhaps letting it all filter over them. Such is the naming of their loss, however, and my gain.<br />Instead of listening to all this bickering and name-calling, simply check out a few of the clips and see if you like what you hear. Track 2 is one of my favorite and something I like to hum at the office, when I eat my &quot;meal on the go&quot; bar, or when I listen to the opinions of others. It comes recommended, to be sure, and is something that you should listen to while forceably cohabitating with bipeds.favorite and something I like to hum at the office, when I eat my &quot;meal on the go&quot; bar, or when I listen to the opinions of others.

0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird, is a book that I loved to read.  Lee portrayed the literary device theme, very well.  You should put yourself in other people's shoes so that you don't prejudge them explains what the theme of this is.  Within theme, a major topic is where the central character and narrator of this book, Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout changed from an immature girl in overalls, to a mature, young lady. <BR>Many characters affected this change, among those would be her older brother Jeremy Atticus Finch, better known as Jem. Scout looked up to Jem and followed in his footsteps. For example, when Jem and Dill Harris were planning to go to Boo Radly's house to place a note on the window Scout insisted that she tag along. Jem also tried to keep her safe like in the end when he tried to stop Bob Ewell from hurting her, even though it would only redirect the attack to him.  <BR> Another character that affected Scout would be her Aunt Alexandre, a person that Scout did not favor much throughout the book. Her Aunt desperately attempted to turn Scout into a young lady. Alexandre always contradicted what Atticus said, and never agreed with his ways of raising children. when Aunt Alexandre had a party for her friends, and Scout tried to impress the women by being extremely polite. Normally, Scout would be wearing overalls and she would speak her mind rather than think of how she'd make other people feel if she was rude. Atticus wouldn't have minded that so much, but it would have driven her Aunt up the walls. Aurther &quot;Boo&quot; Radly is also another character with a great influence on Scout. He taught her to not judge people before you actually know them. Throughout the entire story, Scout and Jem would continuously try to get a glance at Boo. They harassed him on a near daily basis just to try and see him. Through all this, Boo left gifts for them in a hole in an old, dead tree, and in the end he saved their lives from Mr. Ewell. An example ofhow they harassed him was putting on plays that were supposed to be about him and the Radly family, but an example of his kindness was putting a blanket around Scout one night when she and Jem were watching Mrs. Maudie's house burn down. <BR> The final character that had a major influence on the life of Scout was Calpurnia, the Finch's cook. Calpurnia, a black, strong-willed woman taught Scout to not be prejudice by taking two white children (Scout and Jem) to her all black church. While Jem was going through his maturing stage, he often left Scout out because he didn't want her around. Whenever he did this Calpurnia was there for Scout, and open-heartedly invited her to help in the kitchen. This helped to make Scout feel wanted. The most significant symbol in the novel appears in the title - the mockingbird. It is a sin to kill a mockingbird because all they do is go about their own way singing and not making trouble for anyone. The mockingbird symbolizes how people try to mind their own business, but society won't let them. Dill Harris would be a symbol of the mockingbird, because he is a victim of society. Dill was repeatedly shipped from relative to relative because his mother didn't want him around. He ran away because he finally realized that he was unwanted by his own family. <BR>Boo Radly is also a symbol of the mockingbird because he locked himself up in his house and doesn't bother anyone, but society judges him with no reason. People would blame things on him and Jem and Scout would harass him, and all because he just goes about his own business. <BR> Tom Robinson, an innocent black man, is also a symbol of the mockingbird because he was judged by society when he was blamed for a crime that everyone knew he didn't commit. He was trying to be nice, and help Mayella Ewell whenever he was asked to, and for this she made him out to be guilty of a great crime, and even when Atticus proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was innocent, he was found guilty.A quote to support the theme of you should put yourself in other people's shoes so that you don't prejudge them is from Atticus Finch, &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot; In the case of Tom Robinson, prejudice plays around the trial.  In this trial Bob Ewell blamed Tom for the rape of his daughter Mayella. This trial was a trial of black against white.  Prejudice was one of the largest problems of judging.  Though judging is a huge problem then and now it will never be solved.  This book is based on reality and therefore is interesting.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is a compilation of his greatest hits from 1970-2002.  These tracks more than showcase his greatest hits, they tell the story of his life.  Such subjects include love, anger, depression, and more.  These lyrics strongly describe his life turbulances.  He writes these songs and expresses them wonderfully.  They force the audience to feel what he's singing.  His piano playing is unique and brilliant.  Every track answers one of the reasons why he's the third best selling musician in worldwide history, with sales of over 200 million copies.  &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-2002&quot; is a must-have for all Elton John fans.

0131103628|3.0|So far, I've read about 50 pages of the book and I'm quite impressed.  Some areas, however need a lot of work.  An example is the introduction to Arrays (Ch.1, Sec. 1.6).  It has a poorly written 1st paragraph that doesn't really explain how arrays work.  This by itself is acceptable, but the pages that follow are predicated on the pages before them so... in short, I had to find another reference that better explained arrays in order to grasp the next section of the book.  I don't think people should have to do that.
B000084T18|2.0|The songs on this album are good to listen to.... the first few times. After listening to 50 Cent's &quot;Get Rich or Die Trying&quot; repeatedly on both the CD and the radio, I realized how monotonous all the songs sound, and how similar they are to each other. While listening to the CD, I felt as if I was just listening to one track over and over.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|This is a good soundtrack for a great movie, but many of the tracks sound terrible!  The quiet, vocal version of Bang Bang has a loud and annoying hiss in the background, with some noise at the beginning and end for good measure.  Flower of Carnage has the same problem, and it's audible in The Grand Duel as well.  Twisted Nerve was destroyed by amplifying and then reducing the volume.  Green Hornet is overamplified to the point that it's painful to listen to, and White Lightning has the same problem, although less so.<br />Battle without Honor sounds good, as does Woo Hoo.  The Lonely Shepherd and the RZA tracks seem okay as well.  It's up to you to decide whether these tracks are enough to make up for the rest.<br />What a crime that a good album like this was maimed by ham-handed production.
B000060P79|4.0|I really like this CD. Many &quot;hardcore&quot; rock lovers call bands such as Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, etc. &quot;punk wannabes&quot;. But the simple fact is that these bands are not trying to fit a mold, they are breaking out and creating a new kind of music. I think it is foolish how people are using the chance to review a CD to instead bash different kinds of music. Let people have their own opinions!
B00009P1O5|5.0|This album rocks. If you like Neil's hard stuff, you will love this.
B000056BOR|4.0|I like Cary Grant's easy charm and attractive features. Yet somehow he fails to create any real warmth between himself and his female co-stars. (Minus some exceptions, I admit). The movie's dialogue, lead actress and co-stars save this film from Cary Grant's overt attitude of &quot;I really didn't feel like filming any scenes today, can you please take out the battery in my back and recharge my durucell?&quot;<br />The plot of the movie is old-fashioned and sweet. I don't care if it's not realistic to the times. I rather watch sweet and old fashioned romance than the vulgar Charlie's Angels or The Sweetest Thing (aka Raunchiest Thing) that are offered to moviegoers today.
B00005JMFR|1.0|Sloooowww story (to the point where I caught myself daydreaming about other stuff while dialogue was going on), what precious little humor the other Matrix movies had to cut the seriousness was COMPLETELY missing, and the macho scenes and \\"inspiring speech\\" scenes were as cheesy and clumsy as those used in Independence Day. Plus, not to ruin it for you, but when characters flit about like Peter Pan, it really takes something away from the coolness factor. Avoid it at all costs.
B00005JMJ5|4.0|4 stars if you've read the book, otherwise 2 stars.<br />Background for this review:  I am a big Philip Roth fan (I got hooked upon reading \\"The Counterlife\\", which is an absolute masterpiece), and believe him to be one of America's greatest living writers.  I'd rate every Roth book since \\"The Counterlife\\" as a 4 or 5 - \\"The Human Stain\\" would rate a 5, although it's not Roth's all-time best or his recent best (of the recent Zuckerman books, I thought \\"American Pastoral\\" was the best).  So, knowing the complexity of the Roth's books, I was amazed to hear that \\"The Human Stain\\" was being made into a movie, and naturally I rushed out to see the end product.<br />For someone who has read and enjoyed \\"The Human Stain\\", I think the movie is reasonably good, primarily because it brings back impressions from reading the book.  However, if you haven't read the book, I think that the movie is going to come across as overly complicated, jumbled mess, which obscures the many messages Roth is able to communicate in the book.<br />\\"The Human Stain\\" is a very complex story with many disparate elements: current political scandals, coming of age, World War II, boxing, familial relationships, academic politics, race relations, political correctness and modern-day witch hunts, life in the underclass, abusive relationships, homosexuality, and multiple deaths and love affairs.  Any two or three of these elements could easily fill up a two hour movie.  Surprisingly, the moviemakers chose to bring almost all of these elements into the movie, in an attempt to be faithful.  However, without hundreds of pages and hours of the reader's attention, and without Roth's genius to tie it all together and add meaning, I don't think it works as a stand-alone movie.<br />There is one excellent acting performance in the film:  Ed Harris is almost as riveting playing psychotic Vietnam vet Lester as Anthony Hopkins was playing Hannibal Lecter.  Casting this film is indeed a nearly impossible task.  I was able to suspend some disbelief to appreciate Anthony Hopkins as Coleman Silk, but it is true that the actor who plays the young Coleman Silk (who is actually closer to Silk's racial profile) doesn't look anything like Anthony Hopkins.  The worst casting was Gary Sinise as Roth's alter ego Nathan Zuckerman.  Sinise is way too young to play an impotent Jewish writer in his twilight years.<br />What recent Philip Roth book would make the best movie?  I think \\"Operation Shylock\\":  it has the most straightforward plot whose central element (Roth's double identity) could easily transfer to the screen, and there is even a decent amount of action and suspense.  I don't know why the producers chose to film \\"The Human Stain\\" - it presents a much greater challenge for them and audience members who haven't read the book.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I'm not a fan of musicals. I can't get past how silly it is when people burst into song. This movie is one of the few exception, along with &quot;Cabaret&quot;. The sets are great, the acting good and the story is moved along by the songs instead of interrupting the story line. Rene Zellweger suffices in her role, and Catherine Zeta-Jones shines. I recommend it to those who might be dithering because they have the same preconceived notions about musicals that I have.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I've never heard so many people comment on something they know absolutely nothing about. This album is the story of a person's life. Julio Venegas, an artist from El Paso, Tx was a friend of Cedrics and he committed suicide.  He had a very strange life and this is dedicated to him and it tells the story of his life. It is a story that cedric wrote. Once you know the story behind it, this album takes on a whole new meaning. Before you all criticize or praise this album, you must know what it is is all about. Check out [...] and go to the &quot;band&quot; link to read about it and then listen to the album. It will no doubt change the way you think about it. Anyone who truly appreciates music will appreciate this album.
0385504209|1.0|Ok, so I finally gave in and read this book. I must admit to some serious disapppointment. First of all, Dan Brown is no great writer. In the same spirit of dime store murder mysteries, his character development is shallow and he depends almost entirely on a string of &quot;catch me if you can&quot; episodes to keep the plot moving. In between these exciting moments, the characters have long-winded dialogues during which supposed &quot;ancient truths&quot; are revealed to the reader. Let me just say that as someone who has done a lot of research on Christianity, Mr. Brown's facts are more like fantasy.  Essentially what he has done is take a TINY grain of truth, embellish it with consipracy theories and his own bias, and try to foist it upon the public as a revelation on the history of Christianity. In one scene he even goes so far as to claim that Jesus' disciples all knew he was only a human teacher, and that the Emperor Constantine was the one who declared Jesus divine in order to strengthen his own rule. What a crock! If that is the case, then why is it that 11 of 12 disciples of Jesus chose torture and death rather than renounce the divinity of Jesus Christ? (The 12th died in prison.)All they had to do to save their own lives was state that Jesus was not the Son of God, but each of them chose a gruesome, painful death rather than betray the man and God who had died for their sins. There are many other glaring fantasies in Mr. Brown's book but I will not continue. Bottom line- if you want a fairly entertaining beach read, buy a used copy of this book and read it with a huge grain of salt. However, if you are seeking the truth about God and Jesus, look elsewhere. It most definitely is not in this book.
B00005JJX8|2.0|Perhaps it's Cary Grant's robot like charm. Or perhaps it's Grace Kelly's utter lack of it, but somehow these two never looked like their romantic radars were on the same wavelength. Grace Kelly is beautiful in a classic, albeit unexotic way, but her acting is nonexistent, as is the chemistry she generates with Cary Grant. <br />As for Mr. Grant, Grace Kelly seems to be the last thing he is interested in. It's a wonder things work out he way they do. Cary Grant banked on his remarkable charming screen presence, while Grace Kelly serves as window dressing with no personality. It would have been nicer had she lost that fak-o English accent. It's really too much.<br />Kudos to the beautiful setting.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Just had to say, it's great to hear the Iggy Pop &quot;Lust For Life&quot; riff on &quot;Are You Going To Be My Girl&quot; on the radio.  (Did you know that Iggy's &quot;The Passenger&quot; is background for a kid's play station game now?)
B000001DWG|4.0|4 out of 5 (can't give 5 for what might have been).  If you are looking at this CD you probably know the history of this band.  Andy Wood and Stone Gossard wrote most of the songs with some collaborative help from the other band mates (including Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament).  For anyone even slightly familiar with Pearl Jam, you'll easily recognize the craftwork of Gossard on tracks like &quot;Come bite the apple&quot;, but don't be fooled by anyone who tells you this CD sounds like Pearl Jam - It doesn't.  While Pearl Jam's tree sprouted from MLB's seed it is still a different sound.  Consider Mother Love Bone a marriage between Gossard and Wood, while Pearl Jam is Gossard's second, but distinctly different marriage.  While Stone's influence is strong on this album, the true highlights are presented by Wood.  Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns should be on anyone's top ten list (grunge or otherwise).  It's an epic song gently introduced by Wood on piano before climaxing seven minutes later with Gossard's guitar.  Stargazer, Gentle Groove and Man of Golden Words also highlight Wood's piano and songwriting prowess.  This is a sound completely unique to the Seattle scene and one that has yet to be improved upon (if one even can).  However, if there had to be one song that could be considered the Mother Love Bone sound it's the 4th track, Bone China.  Bone China seems to be the complete collaborative effort of Wood's piano and Gossard's guitar.  It's in this song, which admittedly isn't their best, that one has to wonder what might've been.  Too many critics and members of the MTV generation give credit to bands like Nirvana for typifying the Seattle sound, but the REAL Seattle sound - the one that brought latter Soundgarden, Candlebox, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, the Screaming Trees, and the Wood tribute, Temple of the Dog (which is a line taken from Man of Golden Words) - all starts with Mother Love Bone and to a lesser extent Mudhoney.  Give credit where credit is due and buy this album!  And think about this:  Stardog Champion was just a debut...oh what might've been.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|There's just no question about it.  Donna Summer was one of a handful of shining stars to emerge from an otherwise lackluster decade in the history of American popular music.  Lots of people agree that the 1970's left a lot to be desird musically.  Having said that, between 1975 and 1989 Donna Summer would place an impressive total of 31 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart.  Of these, nearly half hit the Top Ten while 4 of her records made it all the way to #1!  She was definitely the exception to the rule!  In 2003 UTV records released the impressive single disc anthology \\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer.\\"  This sensational collection features 17 of Donna's biggest and best hits as well as 3 brand new recordings for you to enjoy.<br /><br />One thing that makes \\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer\\" so unique is that this collection includes hits from Donna's tenure at four different labels.  As you might expect, most of Donna's biggest hits from her days at Casablanca records in the 1970's are featured here.  Enjoy once again all-time favorites like 1978's \\"Last Dance\\", \\"Heaven Knows\\" recorded with the group Brooklyn Dreams and her #1 remake of \\"MacArthur Park\\".  Also included is Donna's huge duet with Barbra Streisand.  \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" also rose to the top of the charts in the fall of 1979 and stayed there for a couple of weeks.  I was also pleased to see that a pair of personal favorites from later on in Donna's career, namely \\"She Works Hard For The Money\\" and \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\" also appear on this disc.  As I mentioned earlier, \\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer\\" also includes three brand new tunes.  I enjoyed all of them but most especially \\"That's The Way\\" which I really thought had all the earmarks of a huge hit for Donna.  But alas, that never happened.<br /><br />\\"The Journey:  The Very Best of Donna Summer\\" also comes with a nifty 16 page booklet that will add to your enjoyment of this collection.  I thought the remastering job was outstanding!  As far as I am concerned this is the best collection of Donna Summer you will ever find.  Very highly recommended!ought the remastering job was outstanding!  As far as I am concerned this is the best collection of Donna Summer you will ever find.  Very highly recommended!
0553277472|5.0|With 18,000 reviews already posted, I can be brief. This is one of my all-time top five favorite books, perhaps the only book I have read three times. It is one of those books that stopped me in my tracks for its profundity. It works on three distinct levels: <br />1) Persig explains the &quot;One&quot; (&quot;All is One&quot;--Hericlitus, the great Greek philosopher), the Transcendent and how the wisdom compares on the whole with current western philosopy. He explains where western philosophy went wrong, the split between Plato and Aristotle, how and where that arose. And he does so in easy to understand, exciting prose. This alone is worth the price of the book. <br />2) Persig tells the delightful story of his journey from his from his home to the west coast, which different parts of the journey serving as methaphors for the interesting events of his life. <br />3) He teaches, he makes a series of observations about life and the human condition, and those observations are at times profound. <br />This is a terrific book about philosophy, about life.
0064471837|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book for a number of reasons.<br />First, Sabriel's world was fleshed out in enough detail to provide a clear picture without being overwhelming. Too often, fantasy for the younger set provides too little detail (making it hard for the reader to use her imagination to fill in the blanks), or too much (making it hard for the reader to keep track of plotlines and characters). Garth Nix describes the colors, patterns, weather, atmosphere, smells, tastes and peculiarities of the Old Kingdom perfectly, providing enough information to satisfy the reader's curiosity and make the action coherent without becoming a book that simply describes another world. Providing just enough information as is necessary to explain the story, the Old Kingdom is gradually and matter-of-factly revealed as a wild place ruled by old and complicated magic, where electricity and machines don't work, where non-human creatures exist, and where Death is a physical place that can be visited. Details are mostly limited to things that bear directly on Sabriel's story, while at the same time suggesting there is much more to tell. This gives the sense that Garth Nix has created a complete history for the Old Kingdom, one that spans thousands of years and contains thousands of stories. Nix creates a satisfyingly three-dimensional fantasy world.<br />Second, I love books about capable women, especially capable young women. Sabriel's job is to move back and forth between Life and Death and make sure the Dead stay properly dead. Not a job for a coward.<br />Third, the plot was familiar (good v. evil) but the setting was completely original, and the back story was well established. so although you suspect Sabriel will triumph in the end, you have NO idea how she's going to manage it. The rules of Charter Magic and Sabriel's seven bells are incredibly imaginative, and the rituals described in such matter-of-fact detail that you almost forget it's fiction.<br />Fourth, it's dark. I appreciate a good scary story, and some books for the younger set are a little too \\"safe.\\"<br />I also really enjoyed Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy for some of the same reasons, but I never quite saw them as children's books. I think kids (and adults) that started those and liked them but found them hard to digest because of the sheer abundance of weird magical details might really enjoy \\"Sabriel,\\" \\"Lirael,\\" and \\"Abhorsen.\\"reciate a good scary story, and some books for the younger set are a little too \\"safe.\\"<br />I also really enjoyed Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy for some of the same reasons, but I never quite saw them as children's books.

B00005JLSE|1.0|In addition to the fact that this film version had way to much camera movement, I also found that I liked no character other than the poor abused husband. Everybody else had no character to speak of, and if you really can't root for the main characters, then how can you enjoy the film? Had the characters been written as seedy and flawed, yet somehow portrayed by the actors as likeable and human, then that would have been amazing acting. But I found them all to be superficial and sleazy. And I found myself thinking they deserved to go to jail!<br />Maybe the play was better.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|All the songs sound the same and all the songs sound like the same material she's done before.  She sounds bored and you will feel bored because there's not much territory here that hasn't been covered in the past and was covered better as well.
B00005MP58|5.0|Austen fans and others will love this movie.  A P&P fan will recognize the novel from the first images.  The script follows the novel better than any video adaptation of any Austen I've seen, ever.<br />The screenwriter takes a few tiny liberties with Darcy's decorum for the sake of demonstrating that he is a passionate man under the cool reserve, but the swim and fencing scenes work so well I forgave them immediately.<br />The cast, wardrobe, sets, and script are all brilliant.  Devices to condense the novel into only(!) 300 minutes are nearly seamless.  I can't believe they developed the complex characters so thoroughly so quickly.<br />The ONLY weak point is that the DVD special features are a little lacking--biography of Austen is the usual blurb, there aren't many cast interviews or bios, and the background is sketchy.<br />I quite enjoyed the screenwriter interviews, and the picture quality is great on DVD.

B00005JMFR|1.0|Save your money or sneak in after you see something else.  Without the special effects it has as much substance as the worst 60's sci-fi movie.  The story is a rehash and patchwork of old plots.  Acting? Was there any.  Bill and Ted's second Bogus movie.
0790749815|5.0|Semi-spoilers<br />The storyline was great. The jokes were funny. And the romance was believable. I'm not used to seeing Cary Grant so taken with the lead actresses. He usually seems so aloof and indifferent to their advances. But the chemistry in North by Northwest was good between Grant and Eva Marie Saint.<br />The story line was fun. This is one of Grant's better ones. And one of Hitchcock's better ones, too. The bad guys were excellent as well.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I always get a kick out of reading some of these reviews, especially the ones that seem 'upset' because somebody actually had the audacity to continue the Terminator series to its natural conclusion.  Each of the Terminator movies are good movies in their own right, including T3 which is a transition movie.  T3 finally moves the plot away (and forward I might add) from trying to stop the inevitable (&quot;There is not fate but what you make...&quot;) to a more realistic plot line and natural conclusion, i.e. the rest of John Conner's adult life as the leader of humanity AFTER the holocaust.    <br />I find it silly when I read reviews which say things like: &quot;James Cameron closed the series with T2.&quot;  Ummm, excuse me, but you could also say the same thing about T1.  I always found it quite a 'stretch' in T2 where all of a sudden a 'second' terminator is sent back to finish the job, etc...Weelll, wasn't that the plot of the first movie???  To me, the entire premise of T2 (i.e. that you could really change the future) is far less believable than the premise of T3 (that the future has a way of still unfolding as predicted).  At the end of T3, the thing the very satisfying thought that entered my mind was: &quot;It's about time...&quot;<br />The point I'm trying to make is that is always seemed just silly to me to really think that you could 'change' the outcome of the future (by going back in time) when the future has already been lived.  The holocaust still had to happen one way or another and that's the point of the 3rd movie.  To me, as much as I enjoyed T2, the plot was a sham, that you could actually 'prevent' the future.  T3 at least gets the series back on track.  All in all I would say the following about each of the 3 movies:<br />1)  Terminator 1:  Easily the best plot line of the 3 with a tight, well written, and original script.  The special effects were good for their day but do not stand up to today's standards.  I speak primarily about the end of the movie which used the 'stop' animation.  <br />2)  Terminator 2:  Original state-of-the-art special effects, better acting from Linda Hamilton and young John Conner.  A rehash of the plot of Terminator 1.  Still, all-in-all a very good movie.  <br />3)  Terminator 3:  Poor acting by the actor portraying the (young) adult John Conner.  Good strong female character offsetting this lead role drawback.  Arnold S. still looks good, but its obvious that this is one robot that has aged.  The plot doesn't develop much until the end, but the ending is extremely satisfying, even though it's also a new beginning.  Although a very light plot (until the end), it's a somehow quite satisfying movie.  <br />4)  Terminator 4:  Well, we'll see, won't we....
B00003JRCQ|3.0|This video adaptation of my favorite JA novel starts wonderfully, features a near-perfect cast and sets, and even wardrobe.  But about halfway through the story the script takes a couple of odd turns, departing from the spirit of the novel in ways I found irritating.  These departures seemed designed to hustle things along to fit a movie timeframe, which is unavoidable, but they didn't have to be quite so obvious.<br /><br />For instance, Wentworth stiffly requests a private interview on a street corner to ask on behalf of \\"my admiral\\" whether she'll want to move into Kellynch after marrying Mr. Elliot?!  And declares his intention of marrying Anne right in the middle of Sir Walter and Elizabeth's party--to everyone?!<br /><br />Austen had written an early ending that used a PRIVATE interview, but she ditched this (for good reason) and replaced it with a chat with the admiral and the letter.  Austen had decided the interview conclusion was too rushed--which I suppose is why they used it for the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the first half is worth the annoyance of the second. Someone who hasn't read the book over and over won't notice much wrong, but brace yourself, dedicated Austen fan, for a few bumps along the road.  The perfect video adaptation may come along someday.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|This is one of the better Live DVD's I've seen and owned.  I was fortunate enough to have caught Coldplay during this tour, and the DVD captures quite a bit of the talent, vibe, and emotion of the 2003 tour.  Those who complain that the songs are essentially the same as what's on the albums are missing the point.  Coldplay is a band made up of talented individual artists, and their proficiency at making and performing music is clearly demonstrated on the DVD and CD.  Definitely worth getting for any fan of Coldplay, or any fan of good rock n' roll.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is an absolutely brilliant, marvelous and cultivating book. The story takes place in the Deep South and is told through the innocent eyes of an eight-year-old girl called Scout. Her father is a lawyer who is verbally harassed by an entire town because he decided to defend an innocent black man accused of raping a white young woman. To kill a Mockingbird moved me to both laughter and tears as I read how Scout learns about life from watching her own father stand up and fight for what is right, exposing and challenging an entire town in it's unfairness and ignorance. Harper Lee, the author, is luminous. It is no wonder that this book shook the standards of our nation for the time it was written. I give it my highest admiration because of its deep significance, yet it was written in such simple language and storytelling.
630463949X|5.0|I consider this DVD, which was shot in Houston during their The Dance tour, really very entertaining.  The music sets were well laid out, Lindsey Buckingham really shows his enormous talent on guitar and displays a very warm personality.  All the members really gelled together for this performance.  Even some of the new numbers, particularly &quot;My Little Demon&quot; were rhythmic and added some originality and spice to the show.  Overall, if you are a fan of Fleetwood Mac, this is a great DVD.  I enjoy it every time I play it!  I am sorry to learn that Christie McVie has departed from the band on their last tour.  She will, at best, be very difficult to replace, if not impossible.  She really added a dynamic dimension to the total harmony of the group.  Mick and John...what can I say?  And, of course, Miss Nicks.  Hopefully, we'll see one more album...
B00005JKC3|1.0|I have been a fan of director Ang Lee since The Ice Storm but even he cannot make sense out of one of the worst scripts in years. Traumatized child with suppressed memories grows up adopted and becomes scientist, works with former complicated girlfriend (that is trying a little to hard to act serious in this film) mad scientist father brings ruin to all he loves, cliche hardass general which happens to be father of complicated scientist girlfriend, mutant poodle, flying Hulk, really easy to hate bad corporate guy that has a personal grudge with Hulk and wants his body for science weapon or profit....  Have we not seen these characters and subplots a hundred times before.  Even the tiresome Spiderman of last year had better pacing and some humor in it.  This movie is a real stinker and I am shocked how kind the reviews were when it was released in the theaters.  Fortunately I only rented the DVD but I found myself wondering if there was anything better on TV while I was watching this movie. Split screens  for that comic book look are distracting and add nothing to this film, bad idean that unfortunately pops up like an annoying fly at a picnic. Music for the movie is very &quot;World&quot; sounding with driving beat and generic &quot;Exotic&quot; lyric free singing fails to bring up the pace.  Sorry Hulk fans I don't know what you see in this one.
6305907145|3.0|If the title of this movie hadn't been Mansfield Park, I'd have found this a cute movie and I would have enjoyed the spirited, rebellious, witty heroine who quoted some of the slyest Jane Austen from her minor works and letters. With a little research, I can even appreciate that the movie attempts to dramatize the VERY subtle points Austen made about the abolition of the English slave trade in her time.<br /><br />This isn't an adaptation, however. It's a movie with a few elements borrowed from a classic book.  A different title would have made the movie okay--not great, but okay.<br /><br />Using the book's title means I expected an adaptation of the novel. I couldn't overcome the bait-and-switch betrayal in order to enjoy this for what it is, a sweet movie based on somebody's idea of Jane Austen's personality in a comedy of manners with some spicy interactions.  The sets are lush, the wardrobe lovely, and the cast is brilliant. But it misses the actual Mansfield Park by a mile.<br /><br />If you enjoy the kind of book that features Jane Austen as a detective, etc. this may be the movie for you.  I hate that kind of liberty.<br /><br />I confess I can't abide the original novel's Fanny Price--a shy, mingy, diffident little whimp who falls in love with stuffy Edmund out of gratitude for his gentle attention and who recoils in horror at anything vaguely naughty.  The movie heroine is a writer--witty, fun, even gleeful, certainly not Fanny Price.<br /><br />It would be nearly impossible to adapt the real MP to a modern movie format.  A faithful version of the novel would be very dull, maybe inferior to this movie, I but still can't forgive the use of the title.

156898443X|4.0|This is an outstanding book which keeps you busy much longer than the time you need to read the text or look at the drawings. The personal drama almost never turns into self-pity, which is important. Some thoughts stay in your mind, as they express something substantial in life we've almost forgotten. Apart from that, some of the drawings seem to have lost context to the story, like children who have lost their parents (if you know what I mean). Perhaps, Mr. Gregory loved to show some of the wonderful drawings without having a precise idea where to integrate them. But as the book is full of associations, just ignore it. Everyday matters is still lying on my kitchen table and often in the morning, I have one more look at the drawings and texts - still discovering new things. Perfect, isn't it?

B00005JMFR|2.0|This movie has great effects and thats about it. The layers of logic that were established in the first 2 movies are pretty much gone. The rules seem to change constantly to keep the story going. If all the rules of the Matrix would have remained intact the humans would have totally lost. But being Hollywood there always has to be some type of \\"happy\\" ending.
B00005JMFR|1.0|From a woman's point of view, to me, a good movie is one that I can go to and have a good time.  You shouldn't have to go to a movie and try to figure out what is happening on screen.  Many people who go to this movie will not have seen one or both of the prior installments, and because of this, they will not understand a thing while watching this third and final episode.  Even I, who saw the other two movies, came away shaking my head.  Granted, the fight scenes were excellent, but the movie was terrible overall because it was incomprehensible and the dialogue was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.  When you come away from a movie thinking none of it made any sense, that is not a good movie in my book.  You shouldn't have to be a Matrix \\"afficiando\\" to enjoy the movie.  I would not pay to see this movie again even though I loved the first Matrix.
B00005JM0B|5.0|&quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; is the best thing that's happened all year since Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor of California! Blissful nirvana has been achieved with this masterpiece! As Aristotle himself said, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Prime Mover of all things. He is the definition of deification! A female robot called the T-X (Kristanna Loken) was sent back in time to rid John Connor (Nick Stahl) and his future rebel officers. Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) is along for the ride to prevent judgment day from happening. But, as the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) said, the future is inevitable. Caskets slung over one shoulder and a machine gun in the other hand, pure lordage. Destruction reigns in the city and this movie is awesome. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a proprietor of the galaxy!
B000001EUL|5.0|...Awesome album. Pure raunch, pure heat. One of Scorpions' best. Its surprisingly good for the first one missing Uli Jon Roth. I have a place in my heart for the man but I still love this album. His Teutonic metal twin Michael Schenker is on here anyway. A three guitar attack with Mathias, Rudi and Michael. Highly worth it but I wonder what could've been if they let Michael in on the songwriting more and gave him more solos. \\"Another Piece of Meat\\" an awesome (ironic title if you read the lyrics) blazing tune. \\"Coast to Coast\\" UFO style crunchy instrumental. Lovedrive- practically a Scorpions rewrite of \\"Lights Out\\" by UFO. Intense singing from Klaus Meine. Get it now, its one of their best post Roth.
B0000009SM|5.0|then you'll like this. my own case was that i first listened to Ap and OS and then grabbed other albums like we're only in it for the money, hot rats, sheik yerbouti etc, but was disappointed. yeah sure these albums might have funny lyrics, guitar solos, weird music etc but still is not as musically enjoyable as the above two.     but 'one size fits all' is much more accessible and in the vein of Ap and OS.  Likewise with Roxy and Elsewhere.
B00000JCOV|1.0|If you think Slipknot is a death metal band, hate everyone, are under eighteen, wear ridiculous clothing, complain about how your life sucks, think that you are misunderstood, have multi-colored hair, say an expletive every other word, etc., etc., then do not read this review because it will serve no purpose but to raise your blood pressure and make you go to your room and sulk. However, if you are not yet a maggot and have not yet bought this CD, or are a maggot but only because you dont know any better, then read on. First of all, let it be known that until several years ago I too was a Slipknot fan. I purchased this CD and listened to it, and because my musical experiences were at that time circumscribed to the nu-metal scene, I had no idea what good music truly was and worshiped this disc as the paragon of metal: the ugliest, harshest, heaviest and most extreme music to ever be released on the planet. Slipknots paltry affected Satanism also perked my interest and influenced me in the buying of this CD because back then, Slipknot was the only band I knew of that did anything so contrary to the established customs of society. Of course, when one believes that Korn revived metal and that rubbery masks are cool, one cannot know of many bands. In time I was convinced of the errors of my ways and was converted into a true metalhead. Do not buy this CD. Slipknot is a terrible band, and the fact that they need nine members to produce this piece of offal only emphasizes this point. Slipknots music is completely infused with idiotic anti-social teenaged angst, and many of their songs concentrate on self-pity. This crap is tailor-made for the losers of todays society, pale, slouching weaklings who will never accomplish anything in life and compensate for their worthlessness by hating everyone and blaming everyone but themselves for their pathetic existence. If you are interested in buying this CD or are a Slipknot fan who does not fit into the loser category, know that there is a plethora of other bands out there that far exceed Slipknot in terms of brutality, catchiness, headbanging value, atmosphere, and talent. If you like heavy music or are interested in real death metal, go buy CDs from these bands: Morbid Angel (everything except Gateways to Annihilation, which is also good but in a different way), Nile, Cryptopsy, Death, and Suffocation. If you want your music to be melodic but also somewhat brutal, check out melodic death metal bands such as: Dark Tranquillity, In Flames (the old stuff, up until and including Colony), Soilwork, Children of Bodom, and At the Gates. If you want the most extreme music metal has to offer, music that surrounds you with an atmosphere of utter nihilism and frostbitten melancholy, then become a fan of black metal (personally, my favorite genre): Emperor (their album Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk is a good place to start), Immortal, Dissection (Storm of the Lights Bane is mandatory for anyone claming to be a metalhead), Darkthrone, and Dimmu Borgir (the most accessible black metal band listed here). And before I forget, if you already own Slipknots self titled debut and think that Scissors is the greatest epic metal song in the world, then buy all of Opeths (a melodic/death/progressive band) music except for Damnation, which you should avoid at all costs. Those of you new to the extreme metal scene who have never heard of any of the bands I mentioned: you can try to buy this music at whatever mainstream music store you usually get your CDs at, but dont be too hopeful because such stores dont usually stock music that takes so much true talent. (And irate maggot, please do not whip out your asinine argument that popularity=talent. Slipknot may be popular, but they are certainly not talented. In fact, the majority of talented bands are mostly underground acts because the public, being the mindless tradition-rooted sheep that they are, cannot open their eyes wide enough to see beyond the narrow confines set upon them by the accepted values of society. Slipknot has become popular because they cater to the inane notions of what evil is in the minds of the public, feeding the inferiority complexes of social failures until these failures feel as though they are superior to everyone else in their f*** you all attitude. But as Anton Szandor LaVey said, aesthetics is not whats supposed to be pleasingits what is. Slipknot have gained their recognition because they embody everything that is supposed to be evil and redoubtable and they flatter countless greasy, malnourished adolescent individuals while they do it. But for those of you mature enough and intelligent enough, there really is better music out there. \m/ )
B00005JM4Z|5.0|Vin Diesel's missing in action, but is replaced by Eva Mendes! Forget about it cuh, you like 2 eat other people's sandwiches.

B0000CO0VR|5.0|Yes, the reviews that you read about Enigma's new album Voyageur are correct in one aspect, this time the theme is different, but it is absolutely amazing.  My most favourite track is Incognito, and the only track that doesn't take the best of you is Total Eclipse of the Moon!<br />So dont think anymore, go and buy the album, its worth all the money you put into it.  Thanks Michael Cretu for another nice album.

B00006CXXU|5.0|If you are wondering if this album is as good as people say it is..... Once you listen to it you'll see why.  In the meantime I'll give you my opinion as to why I think this albun deserves praise.  The songs in these albums show a great maturity and they convey a lot of emotion and realism.  This album trancendes music styles, what I mean is that there are different types of songs such as R&amp;B, rock, balads, something for every mood you are in.  There are also 4 little intros that the artist puts in.  I like the fact that she talks to her audience like that.  I hope I was able to be of some help......enjoy, I know you'll like it!
B00005JLYW|5.0|The girls are back... not a big deal. Demi Moore is back... a palpitation of universes! &quot;Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle&quot; isn't that great of a movie, but Demi Moore's return is earth shaking. The first moment Madison Lee (Moore) was shown on screen, admiration of articulate poetry is witnessed! Immaculate! They should've called Madison Lee, Demeiter, because she is the real goddess of agriculture. Technically it's corn and I made a corny joke, get it? Slow motion has never been better at the beach. What a genius of the director to do that! Who cares about the story, is there one? It's the SOS and this time it has a villain better-looking than the stars. Inevitable.
1567302017|5.0|It's been 17 years since I watched this movie in a hotel room in Munich on German television.  Since that time Hollywood has made their own Holocaust movies, the latest being \\"The Pianist.\\"  By far , \\"Shoah\\" is the most meaningful movie that was made about the Holocaust.  The shear hypocrisy of the Nazi's false promise to every death camp inmate of \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" is revealed through the words of the apathetic hypocrits who watched from the sidelines.<br /><br />It answers the question: Why could this global tragedy happen?  It also answers the question:  Who were these people who committed the atrocities and where were all the people who bore witness?<br /><br />The movie asks these questions of the real people who we want to know the answers from.  Mr. Lanzman interviews the wife of a concentration camp commandant.  Her attitude and her carefully  chosen words speak volumes for what she doesn't say.  She embodies evil to the nth degree.  Her lack of empathy and gross disdain for the 10,000s of Jews that her husband murdered makes you sick to your stomach.  And yet she is not guilty of anything more than being an accessory to mass murder and she has never spent a day of her life paying for the sins of her husband.  She complains that her life after the war has been hard on her.  She wants our pity.<br /><br />Mr. Lanzman interviews a peasant who lived along the rail line to Birkenau and Auschwitz.  The jolly old peasant was proud of how he gesticulated to the hapless souls in the packed railcars how they would have their throats slit soon enough.  The peasant made fun of how he convinced many a desparate Jew to throw him their jewelry in exchange for a cup of water - only to not give the Jew the promised water.<br /><br />There is no ray of hope.  There is no triumph of good over evil.  There is only the sheer will power and determination of the few survivors that now live in comfortable flats in Israel, the United States and other parts of the world.  After the war, they picked themselves by their bootstraps and mentally blocked the horrors that befell upon them by the Nazis and they succeeded to live their lives.<br /><br />The conclusion I draw from this movie is to remain forever vigilant.  Evil is banal.  Evil can be overwhelming.  Only a clear conscience, an open mind and a consistent collective voice against the darkness of evil will we keep men like Adolf Hitler from propagandizing his fellow countrymen and women into similar acts of atrocity.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Let us get one thing straight, the first Matrix movie is by far the best sci-fi movies evermade. Dont judge the Revolutions based on the first one.<br />This is a great movie. I watched on the first day first show - 7:30 pm Indian Time and when I came out of the show, I wasn't sure of the ending. But now that I think of it, it is the best way to end it. Everyone who is thinking for an outright demolition of the machines, I dont think thats what happens in a real world war. There is always truce than a outright victory. <br />Dont listen to the critics. I cant understand what they want from they are expecting from this movie. It might not have solved all the queries that an ardent Matrix follower like me would have liked it. But that is the way the Matrix movies are, nothing is told in Black and White. I'm definitely gonna watch this movie a few more times. <br />The acting might not be the best but the movie is good on a whole. Hugo Weaving has done a remarkable job, I guess one should see this movie for the \\"Mr. Anderson\\" thingy he says. BTW, he got the maximum amount of cheers from the audience, more than Keanu Reeves. <br />Matrix has me and will have you too.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I am glad I did not buy this movie!  I started watching it with some interest and figured that the array of characters would link together in the end.  I was sadly disapointed by this flick.<BR>When the characters made a switch after they open the mystery box with the blue key, I wanted to skip back a chapter to catch it again-but wait...the DVD didn't have any scene options so I turned off the movie. I came back to it grudgingly and had to FFWD through the movie.<BR>At the end of the movie, I sat wondering what the guy at the diner who had a paranoid fear of some homeless guy living in the alley had anything to do with the story's main plot.  What was that???<BR>I get that there was a shift from reality to fantasy but I suppose that David Lynch expects most movie viewers to tie up the loose ends in this movie but I was left with too many loose ends to make any sense of it all. <br />Too annoyed to watch it a 2nd time!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The plot was on maximum overdrive, but the action is what makes the movie worth your time. &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; brings back the human forces to fight the machines in defense of the last city in the world, the city Zion. Neo (Keanu Reeves) wears black pajamas and can fly around like Superman. Why didn't he just fly away from all of those agents in the first place? You would think &quot;The One&quot; would be smarter than that. Of course I'm smarter than that. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is in the best part of the movie where a chase goes onto a freeway and causes mass destruction. Even though his car was shot up, the windows kept breaking in every shot. Super glass. When he gets out of the car, he pulls out a sword and rids a couple of ugly twins with filthy dreadlocks. The creator of the Matrix should've been Will Ferrell. It would've been enthralling. And what was the point of the whole 'party' sequence in Zion? More Monica Belluci would've been better too.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|In a short amount of time with just two albums, Coldplay has formed itself into one of the world's best bands. They are Radiohead for the masses (not a criticism). Their live shows are amazing, and so comes this live CD and DVD package. <BR>The DVD portion features some of the better concert footage you'll find. The plethora of camera angles provides a variety of viewpoints, from the middle of the crowd to the mic. <BR>The show transfers well to the CD, which is mixed nicely and gives the listener a full experience, from crowd noise to the energized music. <BR>The only problem, really, is the CD's length. It lacks some of the tracks included on the DVD, like \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Trouble,\\" which are no more or less highlights.<BR>Still, for any fan of Coldplay's albums, especially \\"Rush of Blood,\\" this live offereing is a worthwhile buy.

It sets the tone of the cd. It's a darker, but still airy and hauntingly beautiful album for her. I've managed to listen all the way through it today and a few of the songs really have stood out. This is one of them. Another one I particularly enjoyed was &quot;Answer&quot; - most specifically this quote:<br />&lt;i&gt;Cast me gently into morning<br />for the night has been unkind<br />take me to a place so holy<br />that I can wash this from my mind&lt;/i&gt;<br />Anyone who enjoys her work will like the album. Those who enjoy beautiful female vocals with a powerful and yet hauting quality and range would also enjoy it. I recommend it and think you should also take a look at her previous cds such as &quot;Surfacing&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot;<br />I agree that it deserves a couple listens. It's different then what I expected from her, but there are still some really great songs hidden in here just waiting for you to give them a chance.<br />My one MAJOR complaint doesn't have anything to do with the music though. It has to do with the darned &quot;BANDLINK&quot; software. UGH! I simply could NOT listen to this cd on my drive until I ripped it to mp3.

B000007T1M|5.0|This is their best album.  All the songs are chaotically crazilly perfect.  They could not have done a better job.  Having songs that seemingly make no sense to the common man, but really do if you *look* for the meaning is great!  If you want something that will have you jumping like a mad man and driving 8000km/h in the wrong lane unlike tatu, then buy this.  <br />daron rocks out like a shavo!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|This is a let down.  While there are a few good songs here, overall this CD does not strike me as anything special.  There had always been something about artists who have a 5 or 10 year layoff in the prime of their careers.  Like there was a reason for it and after all the time out, they never really stayed on track musically.  Other examples:  Lionel Richie, Tears For Fears, Don Henley, Shania Twain, Sade, among others.  Granted a lot of people loved UP, but Shania was so popular I doubted it mattered what she really released. But the big layoffs during a PRIME commercial career have never helped the artist, their creativity, their choice of material, or even the fans reaction to the comeback.  In this case, wait 5 years and then release an expensive EP.  Well almost, 40 minutes long!!!  Cmon this is album length back when artists were cranking out albums every year in the 60's 70's 80's for $5-$7.  But with the price of CD's nowadays, I felt RIPPED off paying out $16 for 10 songs, and it's hit and miss.  No wonder people want to download!  Had the CD been an hour long, at least there would have been more stuff to pick and choose.  I wouldnt of had to like it all, with Shania's CD this is the case.  Not only a LONG CD but two versions.  Some of it is crap, but other songs and different versions of songs I enjoy.  At least I got something for my $17 in that case.  Here I just feel ripped off period. I love most of Sarah Mclachlan's other CDs.  But this is a big let down!  Wait till next time, hopefully sooner then 2008!!??
B000007MVU|1.0|who in ... did he think was going to buy this?  When doing these customers reviews the utmost thing on the reviews mind should be this:  \\"Can I recommed this to somebody?\\"  I couldn't do that with this disc.  For his first solo outing, Ringo  abandoned pop and went back to the old classics which he remembered hearing as a kid.  Ringo got a different arranger for each standard to give each song a different flavor.  Some songs were recorded with Ringo there, some without.  Nothing works.  For many reasons.  Also, his unique drumming is nowhere present.  So now, you're not listening to pop songs.  You're not even listening to a pop drummer play pop songs.  You're not even listening to a pop singer singing old standards.  You're listening to a pop drummer sing old standards!  While Ringo does have a certain charm that he does give to a few of these songs, its not nearly enough.  His voice is more homey than gifted.  \\"You Always Hurt the One You Love\\" and \\"Have I Told You Lately That I love You\\" are the best of the lot with Ringo having some moments in \\"Love is Many Spendoured Thing\\" and \\"I'm a Fool to Care.\\"  Ringo's voice is more comfortable and fits better in country music than the demands and stylings of the old standards.  And that is why this record fails and why his next one \\"Beaucoups of Blues\\", would succeed.  But overall I don't anticipate this ever being in any Ringo Starr's list of top ten best solo CD's.
0486266885|5.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a psychological thriller depicting the duality of good and evil in man (and woman) and one's man struggle with his two natures.  Which side will win out is one of the major themes of the novel.  Another theme of the novel is hypocrisy and double-dealing.  As the plot unravels, these two main conflicts resolve after a climactic and very shocking discovery.  <br />    Because of its uniquely crafted plot, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a masterful tale of suspense.   I thoroughly enjoyed Stevenson's use of imagery, particularly the devil/fiend images, and figurative language throughout the book.   Even his use of puns is fun --  &quot;If he be Mr. Hyde, I shall be Mr. Seek.&quot;   The narrator's description of Hyde is intriguing:  Utterson says Hyde is not easy to describe; his appearance is displeasing, detestable.  And he says Hyde must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although Utterson cannot  &quot;specify the point.  He's an extraordinary-looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way.&quot;  No gore is described; no specific description is given.  The reader is left to imagine what this &quot;deformity&quot; might be.  As the narrator states, Hyde &quot;gave an impression of deformity without any namable malformation.&quot;  I find the  &quot;non-description&quot; very effective--it forces the reader to envision his own distinct image of the culprit.   At other points, however, the narrator is more specific in describing Hyde.  His use of strong diction draws the reader into the novel:   &quot;hissing intake of the breath,&quot; &quot;snarled aloud,&quot; &quot;savage laugh,&quot; &quot;something troglodytic,&quot; &quot;Satan's signature on his face.&quot; <br />     Since I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes and other classic mysteries, I would definitely recommend Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to anyone who shares my interests.  This mystery is a solid thought-provoking book that includes shady characters, potions, eerie transformations, an oddly worded will, and sudden deaths.  And all these details are covered in a book that can be easily read in a weekend!

0385508417|5.0|This book was very comical, and reminded me of some christmases past with my own family. I would definetely recomend reading it. Although, the story is kinda slow in coming to the plot, it is an easy read. Not much mystery involved however. Being that its a John Grisham novel I sort of expected it to pack a bit of a punch in that category. Some of the scenerios that Mr. Krank went through actually made me laugh out loud. In all its a very good book.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Man, the intro itself stands as half of the movie. First of all, it introduces a new cast of mutants including Mesmero and Colossus. Also besides the amazing intro scene, there is the scene with the X-Jet where it is flying away from two jets. I watched this about a week before I watched The Matrix Reloaded and I am sad to admit that X-Men 2: X-Men United is a better movie. Whatever happens don't get The Matrix Reloaded and if you haven't watched it, God bless you. This has to be the best action movie of the year.  This movie will not disappoint you unless you have something against the movie having nothing to do with the comics. This is definitely a worthy buy.

B00006879E|4.0|&quot;Songs About Jane&quot;  is an intersting alternative to the ever-growing realm of music today.  It gives listeners a chance to listen to rock and pop at the same time.  It can touch someone with every song and each one has a different meaning.  With twelve songs it has something for everyone.  In particular track ten had a special meaning.  It seemed to describe something that was going on in my real life.  So while it reached  me on a personal level I'm sure it can reach others as well.  A new alternative to the norm.  Maroon 5 gives a different perspective to the world of rock.  A highly recommended album that you won't regret.
0743455967|5.0|Now this book is great if you want to learn how to write, and name what person would not want to learn how to write when the book is written by Stephen King? Now I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, and I had to get this book. First Mr.King goes through his small autobiography about his life, and also about his writing. <BR> Sure the book is short, but King makes a great statement that all other books out there that show you how to write are just stupid, of course those were not his exact words, but I'm close enough. <BR> Anyway, he shows you how to build a story, and how to set up paragraph's throughout the book. This is also different because Mr. King is known throughout the world for writing horror, but he shows you that he is a good writer and he can just do about everything when it comes to writing. He loves writing, as he mentioned it in this book, and he could never picture doing something different with his life other than writing. <BR> Anyway as the book moves along, he then tells you constant reader that 'there is no magic place where all the stories are there.' No, Mr. King then shows you that it starts off as a idea, when he was talking to his wife on what would happen if vampires came to someplace like New York or Maine? There you have Salem's Lot, what would happen if there was this crazed sheriff in a small desert town in Nevada killing passerby's? Desperation, and the list goes on. <BR> So if you are a person who wants to know how to write, then pick up this book, and do a lot of reading because reading does give you a look at how stories are built.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is definately one of the best rap albums of all time; if not THE best! Every song is absolutely amazing; superbly deep lyrics, tight and appropriate beats and it all flows like a river. This was released a few months after 2pac's tragic death, but this was the last album that 2pac worked on... so it is not considered as a posthumous 2pac album. <BR>The whole album has this mysterious vibe to it; a meaningful deepness which only adds to it's brilliant status as one of the best hip-hop albums of all time. It is on par with 'All Eyez on Me' (which is also one of the best hip-hop albums of all time) in terms of production, surpasses it in terms of quality and only falls short of that masterpiece in terms of quantity; and the quality of this album is evident in each and every track...I consider this one of the best masterpieces in hip-hop history. A work of art... created by a genius whom I consider as the best rapper of all time.
B000089A07|1.0|I didn't think it was possible to make something worse than the original &quot;Manhunter&quot; (rumor has it that author Thomas Harris was so appalled by what Michael Mann had done to his book that he refused to allow them to use the title).<br />As for this newer version, which surely owes its existence only to the single-minded greed of Martha DeLaurentiis...<br />Director Ratner needs to look up the world &quot;subtlety&quot; in the dictionary.  Oh yeah, and go back to directing Madonna videos and brainless action films like the Rush Hour series.  He's playing WAY out of his depth here.<br />Screenwriter Tally clearly demonstrates that the only reason his script SotL was any good at all is that he stayed much closer to the source material.  He really should hand the Oscar he won for it over to Thomas Harris.  Every scene in this film that isn't copied directly from the book is wincingly bad and most of the others are as well.<br />Edward Norton is horribly miscast and the ever-annoying Philip Seymour Hoffman stays true to form as he fumbles his way self-consciously from scene-to-scene until he is mercifully excised from the story.<br />Ralph Fiennes does a reasonably good job at capturing the torment of Francis Dollarhyde but is also horrendously miscast (has anyone involved with casting either film-adaptation of Red Dragon actually read the book?).<br />The only pleasant surprise of the film is Emily Watson as delightful in her role as the unforgivably bad script and direction allow her to be.<br />Even Hopkins who is normally as focussed and dedicated as actor as most of us are likely to see seems to be thinking of being elsewhere when he plays his scenes...  As Hannibal Lector himself would retreat inwardly to his &quot;memory palace&quot; when confined or being tortured - and this film is a little bit of both.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|With only two albums under their belts some might think a concert DVD a bit redundant. However, this is anything but... it is a wonderful investment of your time and money. coldplay is exceptional live and the complete recording of these austrailian concert dates does their spacious music justice. In addition to a great visual experience it includes an audio CD of the same concerts, a 40 min tour diary, and photo slide shows of the group, etc.  <br />When it comes down to it though, buy it for the pretty little acoustic piece &quot;see you soon&quot;. For all those radiohead fans, its in the same category as &quot;true love waits&quot;.
B00005JMFR|1.0|Most of the movie was very good. I took four stars off just because of the way it ended. It left to many open holes which where supposed to be awnsered and just plain sucked. <br />The first movie was worth 5 stars the second 4/4.5 this one is a 1.5.
B00005B0PU|5.0|Simply, one of the best albums ever to be released. The Zombies were always a good band but during this period they were at their very best. Just listen to the bonus tracks here included which are outtakes and tracks for a future album that wasn't released. The quality of songwriting and performance is just as good as the original album. &quot;Care Of Cell 44&quot;, &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot;, &quot;Brief Candles&quot;, are some of the best tracks. Some of the bonus tracks highlights are &quot;Going Out Of My Head&quot; (never heard a better version than this one), &quot;I'll Call You Mine&quot;, &quot;How We Were Before&quot;. <BR>Anyways, I'm just mentioning some songs. You will enjoy the WHOLE ALBUM and Bonus Tracks included.<br />To finish my review I will just say that this is the kind of albums that while you are listening to, it will make you think that there's no better album than this.<br />Another important thing to know is: You'll never get bored of it.<br />Buy It, Enjoy It, Love It ;-)
B00000K2W1|4.0|Although Janis Joplin's genius shines through all of these tracks, the selection is inadequate. An album with a title like greatest hits needs to contain Combination Of The Two (from Cheap Thrills, with Big Brother and the Holding Company) and Joplin's version of the Bee Gees' To Love Somebody (from Kozmic Blues).<br />Luckily there are more comprehensive compilations available, and this album would do as an introduction to the Joplin novice. It contains the impressive acid rock onslaught of Piece Of My Heart, the original version of the timeless Me And Bobby McGee (a huge posthumous hit for her in 1971), the wrenching Maybe from Kozmic Blues and her popular novelty song Mercedes Benz.<br />Most of the tracks are from Pearl and while I love all of them, especially Cry Baby, Move Over and Get It While You Can, one must never forget her lesser known albums that contain many gems. The obscure Farewell Song, for example, has brilliant tracks like The Magic Of Love, One Night Stand and the title track.<br />For Joplin completists and those who would like to get more of her best in one place, there are The Essential Janis Joplin, a 2-CD set with 30 tracks, and The Janis Joplin anthology, a brilliant compilation of 19 of her very best performances. I recommend the Anthology for anybody but the most ardent completist.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Without giving away anything for the movie, all I can really say<BR>is that if you were a fan of the first two movies you will like <BR>this one also.  <br />The first time I watched it I was unsure if I liked it or not.  <BR>So I saw it again that night.  The second time I loved it.  <br />The film does a wonderful job of answering questions, resolving<BR>issues, and yet it still leaves some open, and up to you to decide what is going on.  <br />I HIGHLY recommend this movie to all, but make sure you've seen the first two a couple times first.  ;)
B00003CXIY|4.0|From the outside looking in, Ithaca University seems to be traditional in every aspect; however, nothing is farther from the truth. \\"Road Trip\\", a crude spin-off of National Lampoon's \\"Animal House\\", collided with viewers in 1998. Ivan Reitman, producer of Animal House and now executive producer of \\"Road Trip\\", injects his entertainment style into this action packed, comedy loaded with extra flavor. Directed by Tod Phillips, creator of the award documentary \\"Frat House\\", and scripted by Scot Armstrong, \\"Road Trip\\" takes a glimpse at the precarious nature of college life. <BR>Compliments of Canadian comedian Tom Green, the cast ignite as Barry (Tom Green), a professional college student, leads a campus tour on an expedition of erotic proportions. Barry encompasses the college experience by demonstrating experiences gained at Ithaca University. Shock and scrutiny ravened the affixed pupils of the audience for one hour and thirty-four minutes as four college aged coconspirators hit the highway in lei of heading off a catastrophe. Josh (Breckin Meyer), who played in \\"Clueless\\", \\"54\\" and \\"GO\\", is the films central character. Josh and his long time girlfriend, Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), of TV series \\"Clueless\\", have been nurturing their infatuation since fifth grade. <BR>Keeping their long distance romance kindled proves even harder when Beth (Amy Smart) of \\"Varsity Blue\\" fame, begins enticing Josh and his unsatisfied desires. Desire turns into disaster when an intimate moment ends up on VHS and is mistakenly mailed to Josh's distant girlfriend. In a desperate rage of hormones and humor, Josh along with the outgoing and catastrophic comedy of E.L. (Seann William Scott), of \\"American Pie\\" fame, rustles the dorm dweeb into letting them take his car. Balancing out the ensemble is Rubin (Paulo Costanzo), who adds intelligence along with an intrinsic quality to the cast. With finals approaching, relationships in Jeopardy, and love on the line, the four comrades take off in pursuit of adventure and eventually humility.<BR>I'd give this crude comedy four stars for accelerated laughter. If you are looking for intelligence in higher education, register for \\"Road Trip\\". \\"Road trip\\" is just that, a trip!

B00005JMFR|5.0|This movie by far is at the very least, genius. To take an anime and basically turn it into a live action movie successful, is one thing. Another thing is to take a world of mystical thought into the mainstream is incredible. \\"Why are we here?\\" \\"Why must I do, what I do?\\" Pretty much the story line tackles topics that can fry someones brain into nothing. Needless to say, the movie takes you there and leaves you there. Basically incredible. I mean, even those that didn't like the second one, saw the third one. It hooked everyone. Everyone that has been into anime to this point, can appreciate the movie for what it is. Those who haven't been exposed to anime, are now for sure. As far as there being yet another trilogy, or even just a follow up. It's possible. I think the directors can pull it off without hesitation. Everyone will go see it, no doubt. The ending of the third, is depressing. Very depressing. But it stays true to what the essence of the story is about. Anyways, what's up with those red pills and candies Neo kept taking. In part one, he takes the red pill. In two, he takes the red candy. In part three he refuses the red candy. Maybe he was just on a very bad acid trip, so when he refused the candy in part three, things fell apart. What ever, just a thought. Till another day, enjoy the matrix....

B0000C6E4D|4.0|I came to this site to check out the &quot;official&quot; reviews of the album, to see if they're consistent with my opinion.  But I am alarmed at the &quot;disappointment&quot; of the early fan reviews.  Can we get some order in here?  <br />First of all, yes, I am a HUGE Sarah fan, since seeing her on TV in the wee hours of New Year's morn of '98.  Since then I have heard all of her full-length releases (I own all but &quot;Freedom..&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot;).  Is this as good as her proverbial best, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy&quot;?  Of course not..I got hooked via &quot;Surfacing&quot;, which in my opinion is even behind &quot;Solace&quot; in a list of her works.  But, after enough listenings to tick off my 11-yr old, I think that &quot;Afterglow&quot; is at the same level as the CD that introduced me to her.<br />The &quot;diss&quot;appointed fans of the early reviews are revealing something about &quot;Afterglow&quot;, and that is the fact that it is more piano-driven.  I read somewhere it was the first album for which she penned the songs at the piano as opposed to the guitar, and it comes out.  The songs are softer, perhaps a bit somber (it doesn't mean much, but there's no &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; here).  But my worse fears of Sarah becoming Enya were fortunately unfounded, and it's nowhere near a change in direction as evidenced by Jewel (not hating..I like &quot;0304&quot;) or Liz Phair.  She sat down with a different instrument, and it shows.<br />So..let's give the CD a few more listenings, we current owners.  And as for you on the bubble, go to your nearest record store (not Wal-Mart!), and get it.  The standouts do indeed include &quot;Fallen&quot; (I love it more since hearing the CD), and &quot;Stupid&quot;, which is deceptively calm until it gets to the chorus.  &quot;Train Wreck&quot; is a single waiting to happen, with a guitar line that, though it takes a back seat to the piano, makes the song a favorite of mine.  Even though &quot;Push&quot; ruffles my feathers with memories of button-pushing women (will THIS tick you off?  What about THAT?), as long as Sarah's pushing the proverbial buttons, I am alright.  Sarah continues to write lyrics that make you smile out loud, and her words are expressed via one of the most beautiful voices ever to approach a mic.<br />So, get &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  Then find &quot;Fumbling&quot;..and then pick up &quot;Solace&quot;..what the hell, get'em all.  And enjoy.
0060194995|5.0|Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama in the early 1930's. The setting plays a major key role in the development of the story. Maycomb, Alabama is a small town with obvious class and racial segregation. The majority of the townspeople are very prejudiced and closed-minded, but one exception to this trend is Atticus Finch. He is a white, middle-class lawyer who defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman. The trial causes a great controversy among the townspeople and reveals the true opinions and values of the citizens of Maycomb, Alabama.<BR>     Lee uses the characters in his book to convey different views on the topic of discrimination.  Specifically, he uses Finch's children, Jem and Scout, to show an innocent and naive perspective on the topic. The children have a hard time understanding why a man is being persecuted because he is of a different race. Jem and Scout's thoughts continue to play a significant role throughout the book to represent the idealistic views. Mayella Ewell, the woman who accuses Tom Robinson of raping her, is used by Lee to show the white race's common view of the black race during the 1930's.  Ewell is willing to have a man put to death just to save her reputation.  Her act of indiscretion points out the views of how black men were rarely viewed as human beings and certainly were not treated as if they were human beings. <BR>     In my opinion, Lee does a wonderful job in expressing his views through the use of his diverse characters. The language that he uses in his book really makes the words jump off the page. Also, the lessons learned in this book are applicable to everyday life. He brings you along for a most influential ride filled with love, hate, anger, and such starvation for wanting to know what is going to happen next in the story, that you just cannot put the book down. After reading this book, I appreciated the struggles of the black race more than ever, and I really respect all they had to go through.

B00005JMJ5|5.0|Yes, Phillip Roth's gaudily angry masterwork of a novel has its own particular power, but despite the naysayers, the film adaptation of THE HUMAN STAIN is successful on every level.  It retains all of the harsh social commentary so biting in Roth's written words and yet fleshes out the characters in a way that makes the story of an aging small college Dean/teacher's fall from his pedestal of a life all the more credible.  Some of the minor characters from the book are gone, true, and the faculty of his college doesn't feel as visually present, but the story's strange impact is very much intact.<br />Coleman Silk (in a stunningly multi-layered performance by Anthony Hopkins) was born a mulatto African American and decided in highschool (his younger self portrayed with sensitivity by Wentworth Miller), while being a champion boxer in order to gain college scholarships, that passing as Caucasian would provide entry into a better life, one not stained by the color of his skin and not confined to subservient roles like those forced on his educated father.  He succeeds in passing as white with a few exceptions: he brings his blonde college girlfriend home to meet his mother (a sensitive role for Anna Devere Smith) and finds that his girlfriend cannot accept his roots.  He then extracts himself from his family completely, lives as a Jew, and joins the faculty of Athena College - a small, proper school which he forcefully overhauls until he becomes the formidable Dean.  A simple statement in a classroom - referring to two unseen students who have never shown for his class as \\"spooks\\" (ghosts), not knowing that the missing students were African American - results in his being fired for racism for his epithet.<br />Angry and lost, Silk encounters a woman (Fawnia) who cleans toilets, milks cows, and appears to be nothing more than white trailer park trash, has a physical encounter with her, then finds himself becoming emotionally captive to the creature.  Fawnia (one of Nicole Kidman's finest roles to date) keeps to herself, providing only lusty outlets for Silk, but gradually reveals that she is married to a stalking Vietnam Vet gone insane (Ed Harris in another quality cameo role), has two dead children lost in a fire, and indeed came from a wealthy family she elected to leave because of her parent's shallow obsession with possessions. Fawnia lives only for the moment.<br />Silk meets Zuckerman (Gary Sinese), a novelist suffering from writer's block who lives in hiding in a secluded cabin and who intones the thoughts of novelist Roth. He encourages Zuckerman to cure his block by writing a novel about his (Silk's) bizarre life's turn of events.  Silk finally tells Fawnia his real secret of passing as white, finds his last love, encourages Fawnia to also shed her life of lies, and the story ends where it begins - with a fatal car crash.<br />The story is set in 1998 and frequently refers to the Clinton/Lewinsky affair and the general stagnation of public morals and bigotry, unveiling all the hypocrisy that stews through every level of our society.  The use of this battle of private versus public life is extended in many aspects of this story and always leaves questions as unanswered as they truly remain today.  Director Robert Benton has done a masterful job pacing this pungent piece.  The acting is extraordinary, especially from Kidman and Hopkins who manage to electrify the screen in animal sexuality, despite all the odds against such an attraction being credible. Watch this film, AND read Roth's book, and your view of our society will be altered inextricably.Kidman's finest roles to date) keeps to herself, providing only lusty outlets for Silk, but gradually reveals that she is married to a stalking Vietnam Vet gone insane (Ed Harris in another quality cameo role), has two dead children lost in a fire, and indeed came from a wealthy family she elected to leave because of her parent's shallow obsession with possessions.
