B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'd like the original versions.  That's all.  Lucas worked within his limits of the time (effects, film and money) and created great movies!  Well done...let's see them on blu ray.
B00006AUIG|1.0|This movie is soo slow and not worth it. I purchased it to have a scary movie night with some friends and we ended up turning it off and watching something else (Pandorum). The first 20 minutes is them not even near the building yet! My girlfriend and I tried watching it the next day and I fast-forwarded through most of it. The ending is not worth it. Only one scene was really \\"scary\\". I wouldn't recommended this movie to anyone. I don't know how this movie has gotten 4 stars.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I have the aldiko and though it constantly force closes when switching books it is better then this app at 99 cents.  It originally showed the pages turning and then stopped after a few page turns.  The tapping at the corners to turn pages is horendous and way to SLOW.  Uninstalled and went back to aldiko for now.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|When my wife said she wanted to watch The Tourist, I actually thought that Owen Steinhauer's  The Tourist , a book I reviewed, was made into a movie.  So I expected a serious movie, full of darkness and intrigue, about a spy acting like a tourist to accomplish his assignments in foreign countries.  This is not that movie.  Instead, it is a romantic comedy involving an actual tourist mistaken as a much sought after thief.<br /><br />The Tourist is a action adventure romantic tale staring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.  Both Depp and Jolie have performed well in action suspense tales before and the experience shows.  Jolie has appeared in romantic films, and this may be one her better presentations.  In this movie reoccurring bits of humor are excellent, like Depp trying to escape bad guys without shoes, in his pajamas, running across rooftops in Venice.  This film is full of action and intrigue, but much of the action is slightly funny - like bad guys, on foot,  trying to catch a boat in Venice.<br /><br />Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying Frank, a mild mannered Wisconsin math teacher on vacation in Europe.  His interaction with Jolie, a sophisticated beauty who is obviously at home in the best restaurants and shops, is especially noteworthy.  Depp easily conveniences me that he is nearly a \\"Casper milktoast\\".  Jolie, who plays the sophisticated Elise, clearly portraits the knowing rich girl who is aware she is constantly being watched but provides an attitude so confident that everyone places her at the center of their attention.<br /><br />The actions scenes are believable and exciting.  The settings are exquisite, both in the hotels and restaurants, and on the streets of Venice.<br /><br />My wife and I both enjoyed this film.  I recommend it for a pleasant evening.<br />.
B000002KIQ|5.0|This is an awesome album. One of those albums where there is a lot of pre production charts, songs, musicians arrangers etc.But the dividends pay off because it sounds great, the choice of songs ..incredible and  the arrangements will knock your socks off. It still sounds fresh today. The sound quality of this cd  is pretty good but not as good as a good vinyl copy which really sparkles. The music might put some people off because it is Jazz from an earlier time, but to me it is great music most of which I have never heard before.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|The movie was okay. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. I watched the DVD five times since its release and I still can't point out any favorite scenes or lines that I like. Overall, the graphics and cinematography were great as always. The Sword of Gryffindor scene was exactly how I pictured it when I read the book, same for the scenes in the Ministry of Magic. The most disappointing scene for me, was the imprisonment at Malfoy manor. It could've been much better in my opinion. But I understand it's still considered a kids film.    I still think they did a good job, but I wasn't as 'hyped' about HP7: Part1, as I was with the other previous films. I do think where they chose to end this film was awesome. The very last scene was good. Can't wait for Part 2 :)

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was at the top of his craft in the late 50's, with his TV show, and having released both Vertigo and N by NW. Many say he set out to one-up the French suspense film Diabolique, for which he failed to secure the rights. I believe he not only surpassed Les Diaboliques but created one of the most enduring pieces of art in all American cinema. The man was an artist, and his canvas was brimming with richness here.  From its opening shot through a motel window, Psycho is a tense study of adults misbehaving which never lets up until the final frame. Marion Crane, after a lunchtime tryst, steals $40,000 from her employer's client, which she is supposed to deposit into the bank, but she flees. Viewers are immersed into her character and kept in suspense as to what she'll do with the loot, where she will go once she decides to keep it. On the run, she is seen by the client, interrogated by a policeman while napping on the roadside, swaps her car for another, and stumbles upon an isolated motel in a rainstorm. Up to this point, Hitch has painted images with his camera, posed questions rarely asked before 1960 in a film, and shown one of the lamdmark images in celluloid: the house on the hill above the Bates Motel.  Inside the house, one of the most richly developed, sympathetic villains in memory, Norman Bates, is introduced. The audience's ability to relate to this friendly yet reclusive taxadermist compells us to keep watching--as his vouyerism compells him. Here, Hitchcock uses stuffed birds not only to suggest Norman's self imposed imprisonment but to prepare audiences for his upscoming film, The Birds.  In the meantime, the plot never slows, as a concerned sister and the victim's love interest, flanked by a detective, trace her to the motel. Here, among psychologial dialogue, suggestive character interplay, and an unrelenting atmosphere, we are shown more landmarks: a protagonist's death less than 2/3 into the film, a murder in a shower, the spiraling ofblood (chocolate syrup) down the shower drain which mirrors the protagonist's dead eye, a falling-backward-down-a-staircase murder scene, and the first ever shot of a toilet in a feature film...all original and bold ideas.  This film has palpable atmosphere, great dialogue without being overdone, a razor sharp script, phenomenal directing and score, very good acting, and crisp cinematography. We are shown all we need to see--but never too much--through dazzling camera angles, ominous lighting and eerie shadows. Ultimately, the woman-within-a-man who is responsible for the carnage is one we can sympathize with, even root for, and that keeps us from ever looking away. In fact, I come back. I've come back to this film over and over again, and its power never fades.  This is Hitchcock's high water mark. First rate film, and my all time favorite.
B000KFB4PK|3.0|I bought this watch for my 7 year old lego-maniac. He was excited to put it together in various patterns, but only wore the watch once. (He's worn other standard watches before, so it wasn't the \\"new\\" watch syndrome.) After wearing it to school, he came home and said it rubbed and pinched his skin. He didn't have any marks, so I assume it was just an irritant. I'd recommend the watch as a novelty, but don't expect your child to wear it for long periods of time. On the positive, it is very sturdy and holds together nicely, the quality one would expect from a Lego product is definitely there.
B0041T52S6|1.0|I agree with reviewer K. Murphy who said: \\"This movie, for all it's attempts to be trendy, flashy, fresh and fun, was a disappointment because of Micheal Cera and his uninspired and unlikeable character of Scott Pilgrim.\\"  Reviewer Maskedgamer said: \\"Scott Pilgrim is such a dorky guy how is he getting these girls anyway? They all seem out of his league and he seems like the type that would be lead around by a leash and get walked on.\\"  I agreed with that too, and wished that the Pilgrim character would mature, develop into something interesting, and not just act strong, but become strong. The character remained essentially the same throughout. Like another reviewer, I fell asleep because the movie was so boring.  In my case, the special effects and martial arts seemed cliche and repetitive after a while.<br /><br />It was difficult for me to identify with a whiny, lazy adult main character who leeches off his friends, makes no attempt to get a job (and bails often on his band practice), dates a minor (the under-aged Knives Chau, called Chinese though she is apparently Canadian in the film as much as Pilgrim's character is -- he is never reduced to the \\"white guy\\" or \\"Euro-looking\\" guy), and cheats on, dumps  his faithful under-aged girlfriend for a woman with commitment issues. I find it sad and wrong to watch adult men date under-aged girls. Plus, I was disappointed that all the one dimensional Asian American characters were either killed, or in the case of Knives Chau, punched in the face. I expected a more entertaining film from Shawn of the Dead director Edgar Wright.  I agree with another reviewer who said something to the effect that he thought the plot was for a 5 minute film stretched to feature length.<br /><br />The original Matrix executed and developed the comic book style much better in the late 90s. I wanted to like the film and the protagonist based on the positive reviews. However, Eternal Sunshine was a better executed modern romance with more developed characters and plot, and in terms of the genre inspired by comic books, I enjoyed Spiderman and Batman (by C. Nolan) as better options.and plot, and in terms of the genre inspired by comic books, I enjoyed Spiderman and Batman (by C. Nolan) as better options.
1595141715|4.0|Although a little dark, this book allows you to actually feel what the characters are feeling. Most people wonder why people commit suicide; this book allows you to feel what the characters are feeling. You become one with the book/character and even have a lot in common with the character. A great read.
B004QYZATW|2.0|Had high hopes for this review as we love Johnny Depp.  Such as disappointment.  Characters were not developed.  We almost gave up after 30 min and should have.  Don't waste your time or money...
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Loved the books, but I would like to slap the enitre team that made the movie. Why did it have to be so dark? The other movies you san see whats happening, but in this on you just hae to listen. I am so frustrated with it I don't want to see/ listen to the last movie. What was the director/editors ect. thinking? yes the movie has dark UNDERTONES that doesn't mean you turn ALL the lights off and make everyone who didn't read the books guess what is going on.   SHAME ON YOU WB FOR LETTING THIS OUT HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT PAY FOR THIS WE WANT TO SEE THE MOVIES.   Don't think I will buy the last one, just barrow it from some one and if it's too dark AGAIN at least I will have saved my money.
0307474712|2.0|The characters were not built very well, and I had a tough time liking either of them. Emma didn't seem very strong and Dexter was awful from the beginning. I thought I'd like this book from the sounds of it. The idea is great, but just poorly executed.
0553386794|1.0|My problem with this author's lack of writing skills can be summed up thusly: he crams 1 book's worth of writing into 4.<br /><br />He is the writer in most need of an editor that ever there was.  65% of his verbiage should be trimmed to make this book readable.
0061726826|4.0|Spoliers Ahead! Read with Caution....    This books stands as a unique addition in the dystopian genre. War, plagues, natural disasters, or zombies are the most common catalysts for an apocalypse in dystopian reading. Delirium is completely unique in that Love is what the powers that be used to brainwash their citizens with hyperbolae and a manipulation of the past in service of their anti-love agenda.     I was drawn in by the idea that love is the root of all evil. Scientists and those in government came together to eliminate this threat from society. Each citizen having to undergo a surgical procedure called The Cure(basically brain damage) to eliminate ones capability for love. I found this heartbreaking, imagine what it is to be a child of an emotionally vacant parent. Or worse someone who loved and didn't want to lose it. To be forced or to be imprisoned. Then there are those for whom the procedure doesn't work, despite multiple tries, they are ultimately eliminated from society as well.     Because love was so taboo in this book, it made the actual love story within this hostile and big brother environment, so thrilling. The pervasive government surveillance made the courtship dangerous at every turn. There was almost no one they could turn to for help, the incessant public mind control concerning love pitted nearly everyone against the lovers.     Without going into too much detail, the ending is a heartbreaking shocker that leaves you on the edge of your seat. If I didn't know there was a sequel in the works I might have completely fallen apart, I need to know what happens to Lena and Alex next. Fans of Romeo and Juliet and all dystopian fans should love this books, I know that I did.
1609419693|4.0|I love Tina's ability to make fun of herself.  She does come across as a regular gal.  Actually a very funny regular gal.  She has worked hard and deserves her success, she earned it. She is grateful and appreciates her life.    The book is not her best work.  Essays strung together and I wished they had been ordered chronologically instead of bouncing around but I enjoyed the book.
0756404738|5.0|I've made it a goal of mine to get as many people as possible to read these books. I'm in the double-digits at the moment, and everyone has thanked me for having introduced them to the books. These books are refreshing from the tediously cliche books that have taken over the genre. Your time will be rewarded for investing in this series.
076115678X|4.0|although there was some info in this that i already knew, reading this book really helped me to understand my curly hair and how to care for it.  Since I've read this and started to use the deva curl products i simply love my curly hair.  It only took me 50 years to get here, but what the hell!  i was one of those poor souls who suffered thru the 60's and 70's looking like a dandelion gone to seed when all the beautiful girls had the long flowing hair parted down the middle.  Thank God times have changed and the products are better and there is room in this world for all sorts of different styles.
0316069353|2.0|The main problem with this book, particularly as contrasted with Connelly's far superior Lincoln Lawyer, was its simplistic prose. Sentences were all short and dull; vocabulary was uninspiring, and the pages filled with reams of dialog. This style, of course - 21st century mass market, I call it - is increasingly popular, and no doubt lends itself to adaptation for the screen, but it's still really annoying for those of us interested in the book, not its movie.     The plot was not all that credible; the reason given for the attack on Haller still doesn't make sense to me. The characters, with the exception of Halley himself, are sort of pointless and dull.    Spoilers follow:    The courtroom scenes lack verisimilitude to me, with far too much drama and far too little procedural maneuvering. The prosecution shows far too much surprise at Haller's gambit of stipulating to the blood identity - this is a common strategy amongst the defense, see e.g. Old Chief v. United States. The prosecution's direct was often leading, and no explanation of the lack of objection by Haller was given. The treatment of the associate, and in particular her surprise that defense attorneys strive to acquit their clients, was unrealistic - attorneys learn this in law school or summer jobs. Finally, the \\"5-minute verdict\\" was unrealistic, I felt, in this circumstance - I think some jurors, on that fact pattern, would have wanted to convict.     This whole book, really, was an illustration of a regression to the mean: in plot, in characters, in writing style.
0385341679|3.0|I am giving this book three stars because I believe the author has a great talent. She does an amazing job of bringing out emotion, making you feel the joy, grief, heart pounding fear, and betrayal that we experience in life and the human condition.  She uses language as a wonderful tool and has a great command of it.  So, keep up the good work you are amazing! Your stories have teeth and I do like teeth!<br /><br />Having said that, I am sorry to say I was disappointed.  I read books 1-4 in rapid succession and was really ready for book five to blast my socks off.  But...it didn't.  It seemed like there was a planned out story wrap up with events to happen in specific sections, and then to fill in time and space we had to endure page after page of inner dialog, questioning, and descriptions.  This was frustrating for me and I had to force myself several times to keep reading, and eventually just started hitting the page forward button on my Kindle to get to some meat.  At least two thirds of the inner dialog and questions could have been eliminated and we would have had a much better story wrap up, with the possibility of some resolution where I was left wanting.  Like, how about Dani?  I would have like to have had closure there.  Also, perhaps more closure with the \\"9\\", not specifically more about what they are, but about the commitment to kill Mac, and the \\"job\\" one of the \\"9\\" wanted Dani to do for him.  That left me cold to the final end of this series.  So, the way it ended it didn't feel concluded and it feels like there will be another one at some point.  It was left to open ended for trouble to brew in the rebuilding of the city.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sad to say that this book was not my cup of tea.  I am a get to the point kind of person and get board with on-and-on dialog that never seems to go anywhere but in circles and all around the point only to barely touch it in the end.
1595822003|5.0|This is the most beautiful edition of this extraordinary piece of work you will ever see.<br /><br />First, the tale itself, if you have not yet had the pleasure of experiencing it, is a masterpiece. If you are only familiar with Frankenstein through the Universal or Hammer films, trust me, you are in for a BIG, most pleasant, surprise.<br /><br />Second, if you experience Frankenstein for the first time here accompanied by Mr. Wrightson's exquisite illustrations, you have no idea how lucky you are.  Novels are not illustrated like this anymore. \\"In the old days\\" it was not unusual for a Dickens classic or a Melville doorstop to have any number of woodcuts or drawings amplifying the text. Now it seems there are novels, and there are graphic novels.<br /><br />Not here. This is a seamless match between the evocative prose and these haunting windows into the story. Wrightson's delicate linework, dramatic use of black, and impossible detail capture the macabre, chilling and often sad moments of Shelley's story perfectly, in a way that would not have seemed out of place two hundred years ago.<br /><br />Third, the construction of this book is one of the nicest productions I've ever had the pleasure to own. It's BIG...like 9\\" by 12\\". It's heavy...the paper stock is solid. The fabric covered boards with the inlaid image on the cover. Sewn in bookmark. Each plate reproduced with startling clarity.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I have the original book from 25 years ago, and the original portfolio as well.<br />This blows them ALL away. It's not even close.<br /><br />The price is ridiculously low. This would be a bargain at twice the price.<br /><br />This book will be one of the proud centerpieces of your library. It now is of mine.

Scorpia.<br /><br />Alex has defeated them twice, which is bad for their reputation, but now a plan has come along for them to make forty million dollars and get their revenge, in effect taking them back to the top, restoring their reputation.<br /><br />And this plan has everything to do with Alex Rider dying.<br /><br />If you are like me you will not be able to put this heart stopping, adrenaline rushing ninth novel down!!<br /><br />MI6 once again drags Alex Rider out of his ordinary life, and back into the spy world after info comes along that creates a mission he is just suited for in Cario. Sending him off to Cario though this time he is not alone as Jack Starbright, his house keeper/best friend, and Mr Smithers, the gadget master comes with him. That in it self ups this novel. How the two character are incorporated when we have Alex in the middle of action. As we usually only see them after and before his missions.<br /><br />And like all the missions that MI6 has sent him on it is supposed to be easy and not dangerous at all. Alex should have known better. One thing they didn't tell him, was that Scorpia is at the center of it.<br /><br />The author has really out done himself this time in sending Scorpia to the Middle East with a plan that has Alex once again in the middle. But this time it is different, the series is at an end, and Alex wont be going back home this time.<br /><br />In this book, Alex Rider's mission: to stop Scorpia, once and for all.<br /><br />This book was by far the most emotional and out right shocking in the series. Especially what we learn about the head man at the MI6, Mr. Blunt. I have never really liked him, but never could have foreseen what we learn in this novel.<br /><br />This was the most amazing book, by far my favorite in the Alex Rider!! It was just shock after shock, I was never off the edge of my seat trying to anticipate what would happen next. Major suspense, action-adventure and even if we didn't know for sure that this was going to be the last book in the series you could tell by reading it, the whole book rings of finality.

B002JVWRAO|4.0|A lot goes down for Sam and Dean in season 5. The story line, in my opinion, has gotten pretty heavy and I am ready to get back to the hunts. This season gives you an idea that maybe that is the direction they are going. I have not seen any of season six, so I am not sure if this sets up for less Demon/Angel stuff, or more.    I loved the first 3 seasons of this show, and liked season 4 & 5. I have a feeling though, if I had started watching during season 4 or later, I would have thought, \\"Supernatural Soap Opera. No thanks.\\" I won't give to much away, but note that Sam still has a lot of inner struggles, Dean still likes women and his car, Bobby will still be calling them idgets, and Cass ALMOST starts getting jokes...sort of. The more I watch of this show, the more I love Bobby and Cass. If you watch this season, you will witness Cass trying to set up his voice mail (I was rolling with laughter) and Bobby has to kiss a man. I wont say why or how, but it was also funny.    The end of this season is pretty fast paced and will leave you going, \\"What? Really? What NOW!?!\\" It isn't the cliff hanger that is normal for the last episode on these seasons, but definitely lets you know there is more to come.    I hope this helps. I didn't want to just explain what happens, you can read the synopsis for that. I just wanted to give you an idea of what to expect as a fan. Plenty of laughter, lots of action, and actually, you may cry in one episode. Maybe 2.     Thanks! God Bless!
159448385X|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as \\"The Kite Runner\\" and actually read it in one day, which left me sad since the author hasn't yet published a third novel. Hosseini covers such large, sweeping themes and takes you into a land that's so foreign and teaches you about their ordeals. But honestly, I fear that women all over the world experience the hopelessness that plague the protagonists of this novel. It made me appreciate my own husband more than ever.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This is nothing like Rebuild 1.11 thats just a repolished  version of the first episodes. This goes in an all new direction & shows the characters in an all new light. Most of the film is all new work and any fan of the series should watch. REPEAT: this is not a rehash of old footage digitized this is a new retelling of an old story in a different (BETTER) way.
B00006CXSS|3.0|Being that I'm hard of hearing, I enjoy watching shows with subtitles.  I was very disappointed to find out this does not have English subtitles, only Spanish and French.  I know it sounds stupid but this simple thing really ruined the box set for me, I'm hoping the Blu-Ray has English subtitles.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|Harry Potter 7, while a great movie, has a couple of minor flaws that detract from the experience. Some of these issues arise from the MAJOR plotlines left blank in previous series. For example, Bill is forced into the series at the last moment, because whoever directed the 4th and 6th movies thought he wasn't too important. This is similar to the way Ginny was pushed into the 6th movie; I noticed that almost as soon as that movie began, Ginny was noticeably having a much bigger role. Dobby's thread was also forced. Another problem I had was with some of the acting. A good portion of it (Mad Eye Moody, Ms. Weasley) simply feels forced, and unnatural.     But aside from these somewhat minor complaints, this movie looks fantastic. The cinematography is astounding. Previous movies felt a bit closed-in and limited by the walls of Hogwarts, but here the camera is free to roam , and plays a  major role in drawing the viewer in. In the Forest of Dean, when the 'Snatchers' are chasing Harry and co., and just throughout the movie, the cinematics make it so much more enjoyable.    So, I feel like some of the errors from previous movies are starting to catch up to the ending, but the movie is still extremely enjoyable.     Can't wait till July! :D
B004AKCME8|5.0|While I know the books have many fans, I consider the film a much better telling of Legend of the Owls of Ga'hoole. This is one of the most visually stunning animations ever made and it offers the kind of resonant storytelling that children deserve. Too many films are working to win an adult audience with pop culture references and double entendres. This film sticks to telling a classic good versus evil story that children understand inherently and need to enjoy.
B004V6X90W|1.0|This was not a good movie at all. It was all about a gay love story and none of it was even realistic. His escapes from prison would have been impossible in the real world and the movie should not be in the comedy genre at all as I can't remember a single funny part in the movie.
B004MKM8L8|2.0|Poor visual quality, poor sound quality, poorly done story line.  Film was viewed on a large screen LED TV, no problem with my equipment.  Harry's shot his load, time to let him fade away into the bland English countryside.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Im sure you dont want to read yet another wall of text about the pros and cons of these phones or detailed review of audio characteristics, there are plenty here. So i am going to focus on things you should know before you purchase these \\"cans\\"    If you are reading reviews on amazon, chances are you dont know much about high end head phones (no offense intended) A good idea before your purchase would be to head over to \\"head-fi.org\\" and read threads on the forums to see if these are for you or if there is something more suitable. pay attention more to what people say about the characteristics of the headphones, not if they like / dislike them. sound is a personal thing and everyone's taste is different.    failing that, points to note are    1. If paired with high end, or better yet, lower cost but synergistic gear these punch well above their price. But they are very picky about what you put with them. do research about what amp and dac you pair them with. put the wrong gear with them and they will sound very poor, chose well and they can be astronomically good for the price.     2. These NEED good amplification, dont think you will get away with running them off a headphone jack as even if you can get enough volume out of them they will sound no better than a $50 set of cans. Some people drive these with headphone amps costing more than $1500 for example. General consensus though is that a Fiio E9 will run these well enough for most, so factor in that cost of that. A E7 DAC may be a good idea too if your sound card is poor.     3. These are open backed head phones. they have literally NO sound insulation AT ALL, nor are they meant to. At normal listening volume they can be heard from several meters away. Take these out in public and everyone will hate you. These are a set for home.     4. High quality audio is required to make the most out of these. MP3s still sound OK, but play a flac and a MP3 of the same song back to back and the Flac has noticeably more detail and depth.     5. Burn in makes a BIG difference. Mine have about 100 hours on them now and sound much better than originally when they were new. they develop more bass and become less sterile over time, but keep in mind that these will always be a come what clinical sounding can, with emphasis on sound stage and accuracy over fun.     I recently bought a set of these from amazon, and i love them i am picking up things in songs that for my whole life i have been missing. pick up a affordable ( <$200) amp that works well with them (again, read up on what works), suits your tastes (amps change the sound and tone of headphones somewhat) and almost anyone will be happy with these assuming they dont expect them to be something they are not.

B004SBX112|1.0|i check Android Market and it was ready to play.... but it's only come with Ads....  i e mail to amazonapps rep. and there is no respond for 3 hours....  what i paid it for?  i put it in one star cuz poor service for no updates....  shame on you Amazon!!!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|\\"That's how it's done, sugar\\"  You don't have to be a country music fan to love this movie.  Great acting. Great music. Great cast. Very well done.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Fun music, lovely photography. cute story.  Well worth seeing again and again.       CD a good buy as well.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|I have the whole (made for T.V.)set and the movies. I have enjoyed them all. Its a great story but to much of the same thing. You know there is going to be a conflict and you know someone is going to lose their head over it.

B001HN69B8|3.0|This one is pretty wild. A GREAT show to see but I can't recommend to buy it for your collection.
B00008IAMD|4.0|My 15 year old son turned me on to this album and it is a pleasure to listen to. Hurt is a very moving song that gets you thinking. Johns version of Beatles In My Life was enjoyable but a little down. On the downside just could not listen to First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. Was never a big Roberta Flack fan and just couldn't make it through the song. Danny Boy was depressing also, as I guess it was supposed to be. Overall good album, enjoy listening to the man in black.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|If i was aware how good this music was would have purchased it a long time ago! Especially enjoyed the solo  work on voodoo chile and cocaine.All the rest of the music was excellent also but still not  the version  of cocaine i have been looking for.Had a sound like maybe j.j.cale was on it maybe someone might which  album it is on?
B004SBX112|1.0|I made the mistake of purchasing this from amazon. Now in the maket the update is already out and i cant get it unless i want the version where you cant see game because of all the ads! get it together amazon!
B004HO6I4M|3.0|20th Century Fox has given us the likes of Fantastic Mr. Fox, Horton Hears a Who, and, of course, the Ice Age films as far as animated films go. While I did thoroughly enjoy both Fantastic Mr. Fox and Horton Hears a Who, both films were adapted from novels. Despite usually having stunning animation, original animated films created by 20th Century Fox like Ice Age lack something Pixar films such as Up, WALL-E, Ratatouille, and the Toy Story films utilize in the best of ways. Unfortunately, Rio, despite its best efforts, seems to continue this trend.<br /><br />Rio manages to make its visuals its most cherished attribute. The 3-D animated adventure is intensely rich with spectacular color as every frame of the film is filled with nothing but the most bright and brilliant hues. Calling the film eye candy, in this case, would be nothing more than a compliment for a film like this. It is definitely the most vivid animated film in recent memory. With films these days, everything is so focused on being dark and serious while bright colors are replaced with various shades of gray and gloomy shadows. Rio's dynamic use of color practically makes it a happy film in tone right off the bat and is a welcome change of pace.<br /><br />However, everything else about the film either left something to be desired or was executed improperly. The finale seems to be wrapped up so quickly. It's been building to this moment right here for an hour and a half. For everything to culminate so hastily followed by an even faster epilogue made it all feel very rushed. Rio also doesn't take the necessary steps to build foundation into your emotions either. Every time it touches on a heart wrenching moment for one of the talking animals we've grown attached to, it seems like it jumps back to silly shenanigans too quickly for it to make any sort of impact on you. Then there's the humor of the film that's really touch and go. It'll probably be fun for most kids, but adults weren't the ones filling the theater with uproarious laughter. The animated film's content is more cute or charming than hilarious or groundbreaking.<br /><br />Most of the voices fit the characters really well. Blu is Jesse Eisenberg and vice versa, George Lopez's humor just drips from Rafael's feathers, and Tracy Morgan fits Luiz like a glove. However, Jemaine Clement's voice work for Nigel may have stolen the show. His song is the most enjoyable on the soundtrack and the Nigel character is just one that you love to hate. Also, pretty much any scene involving the thieving marmosets is gold. Those marmosets are to Rio what the penguins are to Madagascar.<br /><br />Rio is both fun and beautifully animated, but the film seems to lack the heart that makes Pixar films so great. 20th Century Fox delivers a film that looks just as good as the best Pixar films, but is only able to scratch the surface of your emotions when it matters most. The humor included in the film seems to fall flat more often than not, as well. It'll make you smirk at times, but nothing is really laugh out loud funny. In the end, Rio is still an amusing animated adventure that's suitable for the entire family but adult viewers may walk away slightly disappointed.proarious laughter.

B0017ZB8M6|2.0|I bought this cd because I got teenage dream by katy perry. I love teenage dream. this one was a let down. Not as good as her teenage dream cd. The songs and music are ok. To me they are not very up beat and summer fun type songs like teenage dream.
0553381687|5.0|I love this series.  Martin does a best in genre job of laying the groudwork and motivation for the characters.  I actually felt like I was punched in the gut during some of the plot turns.  If you like fantasy at all, immediately read these books (and hope the author finishes them sometime in the next decade).<br /><br />On a side note, do not judge the books based on the HBO series.  As of this writing, only the first episode has been broadcast but it was disappointing to me.  The TV series has no time to elaborate on the characters backgrounds and motivations, which is why the book makes you care so much when the plot turns or a character dies.
0307456625|5.0|This is such a nice series to read. I was replacing the book that I had lent someone who never returned it to me. I love this series. Very kind hearted, pleasure to read series. I reread them periodically especially when a new book comes out.
B004WPIJ4I|5.0|The heavy electo-industrial beats in the song KILLL! The beats, the lyrics, her voice, create this kind of dark, underground story detailing her struggles with Judas, or rather, her Judas.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I will be get the movie in a day or  two and am looking forward to it. I am sure it is \\"top notch\\" in every respect. Why do some of you give such lengthy reviews? Not necessary. I find the extremely long reviews very boring and do not bother to read beyond a few sentences.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Good for John Cusack fans.  There are some long parts, but overall a movie worth seeing. Great graphics show how the world ending...earthquakes, tidal waves and other such events.
B000GKHM2S|4.0|I can't believe anyone who watched this great little film, could possibly regard it as \\"boring\\" or \\"pointless\\" or \\"uneventful\\". I have seen this film twice now, once in the early 1980's at the Valhalla Cinema, then situated in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, and once again last night on this DVD edition. Both times I have been greatly affected by the almost painful emotional honesty and great acting of the lead character's. Phil Daniels is great as \\"Jimmy\\" a pilled up, Lambretta riding, Parka wearing Mod,in the early Sixties, living (I presume) in, or around Shepherd's Bush (a suburb of London) and in the early Sixties, possibly around 64-65.<br /><br />Jimmy and his mates, and their girlfriends, are all Mods, an abbreviated term, that had it's origin's as \\"The Young Modernists\\" and they really look and act the business. Mod's hate Rocker's, the Rocker's are greasy haired, motorcycle (Harley) riding youth's, who are living the tail end of the 50's Rock and Roll fantasy, and they are all working class youth's as well. The Rocker's seem to hate the Mod's, who (to them) are effete, suit wearing, motor-scooter riding nancy boys, who don't like their \\"real music\\". Without giving too much away, this is a \\"coming of age\\" film, with a good soundtrack, by The Who! and it is well filmed, and well acted. This film is really quite emotionally raw, very honest, and very sad as well.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Sting's acting debut, as \\"Ace Face\\" the coolest Mod who goes down to the seaside city of Brighton, to make trouble with the other Mod's, this really builds up nicely, and is an important element of this film.<br /><br />I have taken off one star, for The Who's decision to go with their stage show (from 1973?) music, which was released as an album. I felt that The Who's early Mod classics, should have been given more exposure in the film, also no Small Faces, or even The Attack!<br /><br />Still this is really (I feel) a must see movie, for anybody interested in sixties music, youth sub-cultures and \\"coming of age\\" films in general.tures and \\"coming of age\\" films in general.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|A must for Ben Affleck fans.  Tends to drag a little in parts, but overall worth seeing.  Basic story of boy done wrong and falls in love with someone removed from his lifestyle.  When these 2 world collide, boy has decision to make.
B004SBX112|5.0|according to rovio' twitter, its their fault that amazon doesn't have the update yet but they said it should be available today at some point.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|My step-daughter purchased this item from a gift card.  It shipped quickly and in excellent condition.  She was pleased with the entire experience.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Needless to say I was king of Atari and now suck against all my kids and friend playing shooter games (COD, Homefront, Bad Company, etc). Now that you can hear them coming and from which direction along with when they are changing their clips while running.....lets just say I have the competitive edge. Great headset, No issues with the beeping and screeching I had read about. I go 50 ft and then get a little static. No issues with my wifi either. GOOD BUY!
B0007OASII|4.0|This is their best album. Im not a huge fan of Kamelot or even power metal (Im more into heavy metal) but this album stands on its own very well. Its a magic album that you can hear easily many times. Congratulations Kamelot . This is a good album, and since i have heard all of their albums this is definitely their best.
B002U6DVQM|1.0|Along with \\"Ikiru\\" and the migraine-inducingly dull \\"Seventh Seal\\", we can count this Fellini abomination as another nail in world cinema's coffin, which goes to prove once again how America is the greatest country there is. This 138 minute long \\"film\\" is not much more than a high budget experiment directed by a 19-year old UArts student. Lacking in any sort of character depth or interesting dialogue, the viewer can expect to be bored to tears by black and white footage of nonstop Italian ramblings by a distressed dork with hipster glasses. If you insist on looking \\"intellectual\\" by subjecting yourself to foreign films, may I recommend Bollywood's recent output of romantic comedies.
B000085RTZ|3.0|This album is a good one but not so good as The black Halo. Well i dont like too much power metal (with the exception of Helloween). They sound too <<soft >> and a little wimpy for my taste , but they sure know how to play music. If you like power metal you will probably like this album . If you are more into heavy then proceed with your intention.
B004G600A4|5.0|You love disney? You'll LOVE tangled! I'll be truthful, I knew nothing about this movie before i bought it. But I'm glad i did! It's perfect for the kids, something they will really enjoy. A great story, lots of action, very funny, and great music! Adults will love it as well. It shows great on my high definition tv, and I was really impressed that the spanish version even changed the names of things in the actual film to spanish titles! (works wonders for me since i live in a bilingual household). You'll LOVE this movie. I've showed it to so many friends and family, they all want thier own copy so they can watch again and again!
B000FP2OPY|3.0|Unlike it is stated above this does NOT have English subtitles! It is frustrating enough that so many movies do not list subtitle options, quite another thing when they do and then do not offer them!    I assume it is a very good series from the reviews, but unfortunately I'll never know.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Seriously, what was that? I felt this movie was more an Opera than a descent into madness, and it was so reserved and suggestive that I felt unsatisfied in more ways than one. When I see a film I want to either escape reality and enter a world I'll never reach or see a side so dark and real that is strikes paraboles within my soul. However Black Swan delivered on none of these. This film was so concentrated on the actual Ballet that the story never delivered, it just kind of whimpered out like the last slow breath of a dying rat. Unfortunately this should have delivered on what I beleive should be a new Academy Award Category: Most Overhyped Letdown Film of the Year. I would have rather listened to Natalie Portman deliver those android like lines from Star Wars than have to endure this promotion for mind manure once more. Thank you again for pushing me toward writing a real script Aronofsky, I am one bad movie closer to being compelled toward writing something Oscar Worthy.
159420229X|4.0|I have found this book incredibly riveting. This book not only explains the memory techniques employed by mental athletes around the world but Joshua Foer has also provided us with enriching back stories and analogies to help us understand where he was coming from and how we can relate to him on his road to the USA championships. All in all a great read. Hard to put down.
0345440900|5.0|This book provides lots of great tips and advice geared toward all kinds of baby personalities. It gives specific steps to take to set up a routine with your infant right from the start. Let me assure you, this is NOT a book that advocates strict schedules for infants or toddlers (I originally thought it might be, but I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't). It simply gives you advice on how to begin & implement or teach your child to expect routines that are reliable and flexible at the same time. It also gives you tips on how to evaluate & predict your baby's needs before the point of no return! I am very pleased with this book and I would recommend it to any expecting parent!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|This is a Psychological thriller  (lol maybe big words for the average moviegoer) anyways , this movie describes depression , dissociative identity disorder (split personality)Self-harm , and last , but not least perfectionism ( The film closes with Nina staring up at the stage lights while whispering \\"I felt it - Perfect - It was perfect,\\" as the screen fades to white and the audience chants her name.) This is not a put down  , but people if you read reviews were the sentence Psychological thriller appears  do not bother you are not going to get it unless you really care for the film and make a research like I did (yup I'm not a psychologist) .<br /><br />I could keep going  , but I dont wanna ruin it for everybody . If you think that some scenes were not neccesary , I reccomend you to watch it again and really think about this as a  Psychological thriller , not your average Hollywood movie. If any qestion post it in normal simple english hehe.
B000T05R90|5.0|This album is Syd Barrett's masterpiece, and I'm embarrassed to admit I've arrived very late to the Syd Barrett party. 40 years too late! I've been a fan of Pink Floyd for years, post-Barrett that is. I knew something about a founding member who wasn't with them anymore. Fast forward to March 2011, when I read the new biography of Syd - A Very Irregular Head (see my review), and my curiosity about this man went into (interstellar) overdrive when I saw what he looked like.<br /><br />The album's a revelation, and what's significant above all is the outstanding talent of Syd Barrett. And clearly, as has been said before, this is an album that grows upon listening. The more you listen, the more you hear, and more and more you love it. Initially, I strongly favored four songs: \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" \\"POW R. TOC H\\" - Richard Wright plays some seriously splendid jazz piano on this - and \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" and they remain the standouts. All in all, the musicianship and production (Norman Smith) are outstanding, and every song is a wonder worth pondering. Without doubt, the interplay between Wright's keyboards and Barrett's guitar is what drives the whole show.  The two were of one mindset, and on this album they soared as musical counterparts.<br /><br />This 2007 remastered edition includes both mono and stereo mixes. I have tried to compare them to each other, but haven't quite made up my mind which I prefer. Either that or my stereo is not good enough to tell the difference? Even so, each time I play this, new layers reveal themselves. Take Interstellar Overdrive for instance. The ferocious energy that powered this song can only be described as punk! The intro is a full frontal attack. How can anyone listen to this and totally discredit it?<br /><br />Anyone interested in Syd, should check out video of Syd and Floyd playing Astronomy Domine on \\"The Look of the Week\\" on youtube. It's the finest visual representation of Syd Barrett available. Even in black and white, Syd waves his wand, and the magic happens. See Floyd's psychedelic light show and hear Syd's astral guitar playing. It's a downright crying shame that not one full length film is available of one of Barrett/Floyd's historic shows.  An interview follows their performance and witness Syd Barrett, heartbreakingly beautiful and highly articulate.ack and white, Syd waves his wand, and the magic happens.

B004LP601S|5.0|Panic! At the Disco's Vices and Virtues is a perfect combination of their first and second cds.  My husband and I both enjoy listening to it, and have probably listened to the whole cd hundreds of times.  I like The Ballad of Mona Lisa, Hurricane, and The Calendar the best, but the whole cd is wonderful.  A must listen!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Amazing footage on such rare species from some of the most remote places around the world. Really incredible to watch. Get it on blu-ray, makes you feel like your right there filming the action!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I don't normally like musicals or Beatles covers, but I love this movie.  The vocals and choreographing of the covers are enjoyable, and there are some cool guest appearances.  Having come of age during this period of time, I believe the story captures the time very well.  The Beatles' music evolved and carried us from the innocence of the 60s into the era of mind-expanding drugs and the tumultuous events surrounding the Vietnam War.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Watching this was more traumatizing than the most horrendous horror movies I've seen. It calls for major introspection. The current food production system is based upon utter cruelty to animals, exploitation of unskilled workers, and it keeps the lower-income masses ill and obese. It's all founded upon corruption.     There must be spiritual and moral ramifications from eating food from this system. I also wonder what it does to our bodies. A week before watching this, I read a news article that American kids are reaching puberty now at hitherto unknown ages: down to age 8. Could it be from all the hormone-laced meats?     Many cannot afford the alternatives, but for those who can, buying fresh, cruelty-free, free-range, grass-fed meats and organic fruits/veggies is the way to beat the system.
0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis is just a great, great writer. \\"Liar's Poker\\" is a classic read for all traders. \\"Moneyball\\" was one of the best books I have read in years. Lewis' Vanity Fair articles on Iceland, Greece and Ireland were all must reads.<br /><br />When it came to \\"The Big Short,\\" though, I found myself hesitant to read it. Not for lack of interest, but because I was tapped out on financial crisis books at the time it was published.<br /><br />After \\"Too Big To Fail\\" by Sorkin, \\"The Greatest Trade Ever\\" by Zuckerman, \\"The End of Wall Street\\" by Lowenstein, and a stack of other materials eight inches high, I was sick of reading about the subprime crisis and its aftermath.<br /><br />\\"The Big Short\\" is made all the better, though, by revisiting the topic a year or two down the road. As Leonardo da Vinci once said: \\"Every now and then go away, have a little relaxation, for when you come back your judgment will be surer. Go some distance away, because the work appears smaller and more of it can be taken in.\\"<br /><br />The da Vinci advice also holds true for major market events.<br /><br />Thumbing through \\"The Big Short\\" in a bookstore prior to a plane trip, I was immediately drawn in by the color and the profiles. It's the little details, plus the great explanations and laugh-out-loud moments, that make Lewis so good.<br /><br />The book tells the story of the subprime crisis through a handful of worthy characters (who all made a killing in the collapse): Steve Eisman, the foul-mouthed iconoclast disgusted by Wall Street; Michael Burry, the one-eyed doctor with Asperger's Syndrome; Greg Lippman, the bond trader with Fonzie sideburns who talked of ripping people's eyeballs out; Charlie Ledley and Jamie Mai, two goofballs who started out in a Berkeley garage with a Charles Schwab account, and so on.<br /><br />Thinking about the subprime crisis with the benefit of da Vinci's distance, it struck me anew how Darwinian and predatory the whole system is. One constantly has to ask, Cui Bono: \\"Who benefits?\\" And Ubi Est Mea: \\"Where's mine?\\" One of Eisman's traders was constantly obsessed with how the party on the other side might screw him (though \\"screw\\" was not the word used). That is probably a good attitude to have on Wall Street.<br /><br />Lewis also does a good job of explaining why the subprime disaster was so huge. What Goldman and the other i-banks did was diabolically ingenious: When it became obvious there were not enough actual mortgages to go around, they simply created bets on top of bets (via complicated derivative products) for the purpose of fulfilling speculative demand.<br /><br />In this the banks were like bookies making a point spread on the Super Bowl -- except this wagering pool was 1,000 times bigger. Through vehicles like \\"CDOs squared,\\" they took on hundreds of billions in bets with no direct market function, enjoying the middleman's cut.<br /><br />On one side, bears like Eisman, Burry, Lippmann and Paulson sought to short every bad mortgage they could find. On the other side, happy-go-lucky bulls like Wing Chau sought to buy every crappy mortgage product they could find, taking in ridiculous fees for \\"managing\\" these pools of toxic high yield assets on behalf of brain-dead institutional investors. (Like the \\"stupid Germans,\\" as Lewis repeatedly references them.)<br /><br />In many ways, Wall Street is a giant casino. While activity on Wall Street is supposed to be productive and purposeful, much of it is pure gambling. And with side bets hundreds of times bigger than the actual market, in exotic subprime derivatives the casino operators had found a loophole bigger than the St. Louis arch.<br /><br />The trouble, though, is that the prey was too stupid this time. For a predator-prey relationship to hold up over the long term, there has to be a sustainable ecology balance. The \\"dumb money\\" cannot be so dumb as to completely incinerate itself. The actions of AIG and the ratings agencies were just so fantasticallymoronic, however, that the sharks simply could not help gorging to the point of bursting.<br /><br />And then, in the height of the feeding frenzy, the predators got dumb too. In holding too much product on the books, the i-banks were getting \\"high on their own supply\\" as Tony Montana might phrase it. The final result was pure insanity, and the foundation-shaking disaster that followed.<br /><br />Reviewing this book in 2011, I am reminded (yet again) of just how insane Wall Street can be. \\"Mr. Market,\\" as  famously described by Benjamin Graham, is often portrayed as a basically logical guy. But the reality is a bit different. In truth, Mr. Market is a cross between Gordon Gekko and Forrest Gump. Sometimes very savvy, sometimes insatiably greedy, he can also be so intensely thick-headed as to boggle the mind. That is why the market has a distinctly non-efficient habit of driving itself off a cliff every so often. This happens over and over again.<br /><br />With the detailed chronicling of the subcrime crisis that \\"The Big Short\\" and other books like it provide, one would hope the academics would wake up. Up until now, academia has been on the Forrest Gump side of the equation, pushing perfect-world theories so obtuse as to make a trader's eyes cross. The reality of the marketplace is overwhelmingly human, with all the gullibility and deceit and rampant self-interest that such a reality entails. To the degree we collectively forget that, the stage is set for more disaster.d then, in the height of the feeding frenzy, the predators got dumb too.

B004WMKSH2|5.0|After the last few movies, I was afraid this one would follow suite and deviate from the book in a few important ways, but I was pleasantly surprised! The storyline is complex, intriguing and most of all, very Harry Potter! I loved the books (and no, I am not a shut-in, a teenager or a crazy person) and Harry Potter 7.1 is a great film adaptation to the book. Yes, it is a dark thriller and yes, there are some violent scenes, but the movie is well-done and it will have you waiting with bated breath for 7.2.
0316066524|5.0|I honestly can't wait to read it over and over, maybe once every year or two, for the rest of my ENTIRE LIFE.  I'm not even going to try to explain the story or DFW's writing style.  I just wanted to rate it 5 stars.    If you do one good thing for yourself in your lifetime, you should be to buy this book and read it.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Was well satisfied with the price and the prompt delivery.  I listen to this CD all the time in my car.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The Kindle version is $1.40 MORE than Amazon's hardback version--and $19.99 more than the public library version which I ultimately read.  Until Kindles can read library versions, or at least can get a break on price, I think the Kindle platform will go the way of DivX players (what are those you ask?).

B004SBS8LA|3.0|Fun way to pass the time, not different enough from the original to justify paying a 2nd time for.  It has improved graphics but that makes it run poorly on lower - end phones.

I love the approach to look at what our strong attributes are and how to best fit them into our careers and daily lives so that we can be our authentic selves  - instead of trying to change who we are to be something we (or someone else) only wish(es) we were....
B004I11VZA|5.0|In some ways I did not like this one quite as well as \\"Ip Man\\", while in other ways I liked it better, but still thought it worthy of a five star rating!  The acting was good, but more importantly for such a film, the fight choreography and authenticity of the Wing Chun techniques was incredible!  I really hope they can talk Donnie Yen into doing \\"Ip Man 3\\"!  Also, the surprise at the end was awesome!  ;-)
B001UV4XHY|1.0|How far they have fallen!  I have the two disc set of each of the other movies (1- 6) and expected the same quality from this one.  Instead, I got a poorly filmed, poorly written DVD that is a bitter disappointment.  And what is this business that only Walmart sells the two-disk version?  Not everyone shops at Wally World or cares to do so.  I resent being forced to shop where I don't agree with their corporate policy.  Had 1-6 been sold this way, I could understand it but they have simply downgraded their product without warning the buying public.  Poor business practice and it'll come back to bite them in the @ss.  Don't you just love surprises like this?  You find the product inferior but you can't return it?  Not good for Amazon's business either!
B0024FADAQ|3.0|This is a good ol' fashioned sci-fi movie. It has everything you love to see, aliens, romance, danger, spaceships, lasers, and bad comic relief. I was surprised by the special effects. they didn't suck as bad as I would have expected. This movie has me torn because its not very good, yet it was a lot of fun watching and I would recommend it to everyone who loves fun movies. There are much better sci-fi movies out there, but few as fun as this one. Check it out.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|This film is entertaining and well-acted, but in the end I give a mere 3 stars, because it is so unreal in certain important ways.     The Story:  Matthew McConaughey plays a street-wise, prison-wise lawyer (Mickey Haller) who works the system to make a living.  In some ways he's a sleazy guy, representing biker gangs, bribing clerks for info etc, but he's also got a kind heart for his daughter, his ex and his friend Frank (Bill Macy, a private investigator).  I think it's good role for McConaughey, and like a lot of other Hollywood \\"pretty boys\\" (e.g. Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio) his acting gets better as he ages and plays more serious parts.  If you'd ever gotten accused of a crime, his Mickey Haller character would be the guy you'd hire to battle the system!    Haller comes upon a case of a snobby rich young man (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of a nasty assault on a prostitute, and takes over the case from the family's clueless \\"blue-blood\\" lawyer.  Then the story gets intriguing, as you wonder if the rich kid is \\"playing\\" Haller.  Then you realize that he is, big time, especially when Macy gets killed, and Haller seems like he's in a deep hole that's impossible to get out of.  It's when he's in this impossible-seeming situation that McConaughey's acting skills come out.  Is he a cool lawyer with the whole world at his feet, or a lonely, angry, divorced drunk who is barely clinging on without losing it?  It's this time of desparation & suffering that gives the movie a little more depth than your typical formulaic film noir.    All Haller has to do is lose the case and the rich snob will be jailed for a long, long time.  But he's set on winning the case for his client and simultaneously getting his client booked for murder. How he does this is a little too slick for me to believe, but I admit it's good escapism.  Also, as many viewers say, the movie has well acted characters.    So WHAT'S WRONG with this movie (SPOILER ALERT BELOW!)?  It took me a while of contemplation to figure this out.  What's wrong with its message? Why doesn't it resonate with me?  It's because it is a total warping of reality.  This movie, while it PURPORTS to be realistic, is total BS reality-wise.  A sleazy defense lawyer who is amoral and works the system for money, is the hero?  A white, handsome, upper-class, Ferrari-driving real-estate salesman and his well-dressed successful Mother are evil Bad Guys, like the Joker and the Riddler?  Biker gangs are other heros who are on the side of the hero?  Of course, we HAVE TO BE PC.  SO ... can't have Blacks or Hispanics, who are 95% of the gang population in LA, be the criminals!  No!  The gang-looking latino who was put in jail for murder, was framed!  He even says \\"My Mom is going to die when she knows I'm going to jail!\\"  He says it so well, you think you're going to cry!  Forget about all those other gangbangers who aren't innocent (like the guys who beat the Giants fan into a coma), this movie tells you that you just can't generalize!      So the movie (& I assume the book) depicts a flipped reality in which the population that is probably responsible for <1% of the violent crime in the US (rich, white, USC-educated real-estate selling golfers, AND their mothers) are the evil-doers.  And everyone else in the non-upper-class world: prostitutes, ex-hippies, minorities, bikers, sleaze-bags, are just fine ... i.e. they're GOOD PEOPLE.   Who we should really hate are those rich golfing bastards, not only because we're jealous of their money, and they're not taxed enough of course, but they are evil serial killers to boot and guarded by their homicidal 65 year-old Armani-clothed mothers.    In other words, what passes for a thriller on the surface is also very manipulative class warfare and PC propaganda.  But I guess it's worth a few bucks for some temporary escapism.
0743437497|4.0|Stephen King has been one of those authors that has really caught my attention but I never really owned any of his books until The Shining.  I had heard of both the book and movie, but mostly of the movie.  I had never seen it though so I had nothing to compare to.    As the book starts, it kind of felt like you were already a part of the story.  It launches into Jack being interviewed for the job of caretaker for the Overlook.  But it doesn't feel rushed.  It feels like just the right place.  As it goes from that, to the worry Danny has about his father not making it home, it progresses very well.  Danny's dreams of the hotel, shown to him by an \\"invisible friend\\" named Tony, felt so real that I couldn't help but feel nervous for him as his family set off to the hotel.    When the family gets to the Overlook at the final day of the season, Danny and Hallorann, the chef of the hotel, realize that they share what Hallorann's grandmother simply refers to as \\"the shining\\", which is the ability of second sight so to speak.  Hallorann promises Danny that he will come running if Danny just calls out to him.  He also advises Danny to stay clear of Room 217 and be careful around the hedge animals.    Through the course of the book, the hotel starts to \\"awaken\\".  Danny sees blood and gore in the Presidential Suite.  A nest of wasps, which Jack had used a bug bomb on and shook empty, suddenly came back to life.  The animal topiary start to move one day while Jack is trimming them.  And Danny, through child curiosity, finds out why he should stay out of Room 217.  The hotel really comes to life though after Jack reads through a gold and white scrapbook that was left in the basement among a small mountain of invoices, receipts, and the like.    The hotel wants Danny for his strong shining, but has problems taking control of him so the hotel feeds on Jack's alcoholism and finally takes control of him during the climax of the book.  It provides drinks for him and Grady, the caretaker before Jack who killed his family and himself, frees Jack from the pantry after Wendy and Danny lock him in after his first attempt on her life.  He also provides a roque mallet for him to use.  Jack does manage to injury Wendy, breaking her ribs and something in her back, when Hallorann arrives after receiving Danny's call.  Hallorann is also injured when \\"Jack\\", now a part of the hotel, goes after Danny.    The ending was satisfying to me.  Jack is redeemed in a way, and Wendy, Danny, and Hallorann get away.  The character work was wonderful, I really did like Hallorann.  The only thing that truly bothered me though was some language used that I don't particularly care for but it can be overlooked.    And if I learned one thing from reading The Shining, it's definitely do not read Stephen King books at night.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Though very controversial, I loved this movie.  I had my partner watch it as well as a straight female friend of ours.  My partner was hesitant about the theme and our straight female friend was simply curious. At the end of the movie, they had both been converted and they both loved the movie.  This movie was not released for almost 2 years due to the taboo subject matter.  I am glad that it is now being released.  The cinematography is amazing and the story line touching.  You will forget the whole taboo nature of the story by the end of the movie.

B003UESJH4|5.0|When I saw this motion picture I was blown away. I loved everything about it. It was so much better than any of the year's other movies. When I left the theater I was certain it would do well in the various awards competitions. It was a simple, honest story that smacked of reality. As a former movie reviewer and documentary film maker it seemed to me that  everything about this feature was perfect. It was definitely a motion picture I wanted to have in my personal library because seeing it on television with commercials would ruin it by destroying the magic.

1857885082|3.0|Mrs. Fox is slightly witty and occasionally funny, but also long winded and redundant. Every chapter pretty much says the same thing: the English love privacy, pretend to be modest and despise being too earnest or serious and like to be humorous in an ironic sort of way. That's pretty much the entire book.  the essential gist of the book is that the English are socially inept.  Don't buy the book, just go to your local book store and read the last two chapters where she summarizes all her findings and you will save yourself a lot of time and greenbacks.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Technically it's half of a movie but I really feel that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stands on its own as an excellent HP film. While I really like it I probably wouldn't consider it to be the best HP movie but I quite enjoy it, some of the character's emotions come out really well here. For those who have not read J.K. Rowling's seventh and final book in the series the action may seem slow and it may seem a bit boring but this Part 1 was necessary. Not everyone will see the beauty of this 7th Potter film but I think splitting the final film in two was a great decision, of course money-wise it was a very good idea for Warner Bros profitable to do so. It also allows viewers a more complete visual experience of the book. Contrary to what some may think I feel that splitting the final book into two movies was for the best because it gives more room for character emotion, ambiance and best of all, it doesn't rush things. I must say the action is a bit slower and Hogwarts is missed but Part 1 sets things up nicely for the conclusion of the Harry potter saga on movies. Everything that needed to be in this movie was and they didn't cut out much. As for the acting I don't think the actors have ever been better in a Harry Potter movie their performances here were nothing short of excellent and brilliant. I won't go through the storyline or the events of the movie, this should be clear by now and I don't think there is much more to say, basically Harry, Hermione and Ron search for the missing horcruxes. I don't want to spoil anything or reveal too much but I just want to say that one of my favorite parts was the animation showed for the story of the three brother in \\"The Tales of Beetle the Bard\\". It looked fantastic visually and even if brief is I feel, a highlight of Part 1.<br /><br />For the Blu-Ray: The special features are Blu-Ray exclusive, now I don't know why that is. Perhaps Warner thought that those buying the DVD version (which is a LOT) wouldn't like to have bonus features for some reason. The Blu-Ray has a disc devoted to special features only, the extras are a nice touch for fans and I did like them. For instance the 7 Harrys feature was pretty cool and I liked watching the deleted scenes but I probably won't watch the bonuses very often. The digital copy is not on a disc, it's an online download and from what other reviewers are saying it's not ideal because of software download, unwanted software and it isn't the \\"safest\\" download, let's put it at that. I would've rather had the digital copy on a disc like much of the other Blu releases but that's just a minor complaint.<br /><br />There are many complaints about the picture quality, especially for the DVD. I own the Blu-Ray/Digital Copy/DVD combo version of Deathly Hallows and I have to admit that these are definitely not the best Blu-Ray or DVD that I've seen. I watched both formats and I think the Blu-Ray looks better in comparison the very dark picture that you get with the DVD. I watched the movie in theaters when it was released and I don't remember it to be this dark. I don't know what it is but Warner Bros managed to screw up the picture quality for this movie, perhaps this will be corrected in the not too distant future with a boxed set of the 8 movies?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; it's a nice addition to the series and set the viewers for what should be a fantastic conclusion. It's hard to believe 2011 marks the 10 year anniversary of the first movie and the franchise! I can't wait to see Part 2 as I think Part 1 set us up so nicely for it!

B0028RXXE8|4.0|My big problem with any HBO created series, is the unnecessary use of profanity, particularly the \\"F\\" word. For example, I saw one reviewer that raved about Deadwood, but I struggled through only one episode, and by the end of it, my ears were sore because it seemed that none of the cast could form a single sentence without  the latter. I simply found no redeeming qualities about it.     While Rome is not entirely free from this complaint, it's very well done and possibly the only thing that could make it more convincing is for the actors to all speak Latin (though I'd prefer not to have to deal with subtitles so I'm happy they didn't).    Good job HBO.

0312600844|4.0|Most present-day American archetypes will see a reflection of themselves somewhere in Jonathan Franzen's \\"Freedom.\\"<br /><br />And they will most likely cringe.<br /><br />The author may or may not be the second coming of the greatest American novelist, but he is definitely a good, and most American novelist.<br /><br />And for sure, he forgoes a place in the classical canon with his frequent pop references and appeals to the current national sensibilities, but Franzen's got a few things to say about the people of the United States and gosh darn if he isn't going to say them.<br /><br />It reportedly took the author 10 years to write \\"Freedom,\\" but he was not simply grooming something that was drafted in 2002. He followed the nation's progress, or lack of progress as he seems to suggest, growing his story right up until the financial crisis of 2008.<br /><br />\\"Freedom\\" represents the triumph of a kind of literary reporting. Franzen's people swim in the zeitgeist the way we all do, like it or not.<br /><br />The novel charts a Midwestern family of four's wade through the 1970s all the way to the aforementioned sub-prime market meltdown with a keen eye on what makes an American throughout the epoch under examination.<br /><br />This family of his mind's creation, the Berglunds, with the help of their antecedents, siblings and offspring, swim in the current of contemporary events without the author ever seeming to stretch things to fit his scheme.<br /><br />He comments on our ugly national mood, growing intolerance, gaping inequalities, corruptions, perversion and decadence with irrefutable accuracy, sparing none, right. left, straight, gay, Christian, secular, blue or red.<br /><br />There is a density to the prose. Some have said the author uses too many words, but if that is the case, it is rarely in useless or neurotic digression. The action moves along all the while employing the kind techniques that separate finer literature from a good potboiler.<br /><br />And for all the darkness and foreboding Franzen thrusts upon his ample readership, he manages to close on an optimistic note, which, too, makes him very American.<br /><br />All of it while seemingly riffing an effortless path through his own sentiments, when those in the know will understand how much more went into this fine and worthy work.d for all the darkness and foreboding Franzen thrusts upon his ample readership, he manages to close on an optimistic note, which, too, makes him very American.<br /><br />All of it while seemingly riffing an effortless path through his own sentiments, when those in the know will understand how much more went into this fine and worthy work.

0307454541|5.0|It took me a while to get into this story, but it was worth it. TGWTDT is a big, rambling, and ultimately very good and satisfying book. The Swedish name, Men Who Hate Women, is a better match as there are some very evil men in the story. The English book takes its name from the dragon tattoo on the back of Lisbeth Salander, one of the two main protagonists. Lisbeth is young, truculent, hyper-intelligent, asocial, relentless -- I like her. The other main protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, is a recently disgraced investigative reporter who is driven to clear his name. They start off with separate stories that merge partway through the book as Lisbeth and Mikael work to solve an old mystery. This book provides memorable characters, danger, mystery, action, and vengeance. What's not to like?
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann continues to amaze. Not only has he become one of the most popular and loved recitalists (six encores at his recent Los Angeles recital of lieder) who has successfully entered the arena of brilliant lieder singers, but he also has such a magnificent baritone-colored tenor voice and sports such a fitting physique on the stage that he is a natural to be cast in the versimo operas. And that is what he delivers generously on this new release. Collaborating with Antonio Pappano and the<br />Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Jonas Kaufmann is sure to gain an even wider audience with his intelligent, well-focused masculine tenor with which he adds to the definition of 'verismo'  - the realism of operatic literature.<br /><br />The selection on this recording is wide ranging, another suggestion that Kaufmann is not satisfied to fill a CD with the expected.  Some of the arias are Enrico Caruso favorites while others are from rarely heard operas today.  For example he offers  arias from 'Giulietta e Romeo'  composed by Zandonai, 'I Lituani' by Ponchelli, Leoncavallo's 'La Boheme' (instead of opting of the popular Puccini version), and the incredibly beautiful 'Ombra di nube' by Licinio Refice (1883 - 1954) - a priest and composer few have ever heard.  But Kaufmann does not rest on his intellect of introducing arias for the novelty of it all.  He graciously includes the great 'Pagliacci' aria of Leoncavallo, two arias from Mascagni's 'Cavalleria rusitcana',  two arias from Boito's 'Mefistofele', memorable interpretations from Giordano's 'Andrea Chenier' and 'Fedora' , and from Francesco Cil&egrave;a's operas 'L'Arlesiana' and 'Adriana Lecouvreur'.<br /><br />Some may feel this voice is too large for the tenor styles and sounds  we are used to hearing in these roles, but Jonas Kaufmann's burnished bronze tone does not hamper him from tackling the very high notes with complete ease but his vocal control is so polished that he is able to deliver the pianissimos with equal ease and beauty of timbre.  This is a remarkable recital by a gifted tenor - now equally at home in the Italian roles as he is the master of the German repertoire. Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 11ty of timbre.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|When I pre-ordered this, it was listed as a six-disc set.  And, no, I'm not confusing it with the full series (which, geek dummy, I ordered as well).  I saw it had six discs, so I assumed that the original theatrical releases wre going to be in there, and all the grousing would be for naught.  Now I see that there are only three discs.  Hmmm...can I assume that each will have the originals, and light on \\"extras?\\"  Nope, Greedo will shoot first, Han will call Jabba a wonderful human being while stepping on his tail (and maintaining his posture), all kinds of critters will clutter up various desert scenes, and the ghost of Anakin Skywalker will not be played by Sebastian Shaw (how about that-I can't even think of the name of the piece of wood who killed Anakin in the 2nd and 3rd episodes...)  Look for the Patton Oswalt comedy bit about George Lucas; I'm sure you'll find it amusing.    I will update this review to 4 stars if the original theatrical releases magically find their way onto this set.  5 stars if they're remastered in full 5.1 (or 7.1!) and the new versions of the films are not included.
0307389839|3.0|Haruki Murakami (\\"After Dark,\\" \\"Dance Dance Dance\\") took up both writing and long distance running in the early 1980s and has never turned away from either passion.  With \\"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,\\" Murakami tries to help the reader understand just why it is that he insists on running at least one marathon every year, year after year.  Unfortunately, the story rarely gets all that interesting.    Essentially the book boils down to, Murakami likes to run long distances even though distance running is a lonely, painful pursuit.  He trains a lot, because training is important to distance running. In the middle of a race, he often hates what he's doing, but then he finishes and everything is OK.  He's getting older, so his body is slowing down.  So he tries triathlons.    That's about it, and the writing is about as flat and dull as that paragraph.  There are some interesting tidbits, such as Murakami's struggle with a painful knee and his crazy entry into a 62-mile super-marathon.  But these stories exist in a vacuum and don't really go anywhere - his knee stops hurting, and he finishes the super-marathon.  Murakami believes that both distance running and writing a novel require tremendous endurance . . . not to be too flippant, but reading this slim memoir (180 pages for the 2008 hardcover edition) felt like a slog as well.    The memoir offers little insight into Murakami's situation.  What does his wife think about his dedication to running?  Hard to say - I'm not even sure that Murakami tells us his wife's name.  Murakami writes a bit about the runner's blues, but offers far less insight into the distance runner's mind than, say, Christopher MacDougall's \\"Born to Run.\\"  Ultimately, the book has very little to offer.    Murakami must be a heck of a writer.  He writes briefly about the awards he's won and the fact that he gets to lecture in Cambridge.  But based on this slim volume, we have to assume that his other books must be terrific indeed.

It's immoral.

There have been other disconcerting developments in response to, ostensibly, the `war on terror', namely the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects without their being convicted, the use of control orders and the ugly suspicion of a lax attitude to torture.<br /><br />We must add here that at the time of the book's publication by OUP in July 2010, the UK's new coalition government had been in place for only about three months and, as we write in the first quarter of 2011, many of the above mentioned excesses have already been modified or dismantled altogether.<br /><br />Nevertheless, human rights continues to be a vexed issue requiring continuing vigilance and, yes, a spirit of enlightened and informed scepticism which this book exemplifies.<br /><br />The editors identify 2 kinds of scepticism here: ideological and institutional. Ideological scepticism revolves mainly around `doubts about the politically biased content of much of human rights law.'  Institutional skepticism focuses on the (very worrying) decline in recent years of the role of parliaments and the corresponding extension of the political role of the courts in interpreting and enforcing human rights legislation.<br /><br />In drawing attention to these concerns, this book has done a worthy service in adding argument and ammunition to this debate, the outcome of which will certainly affect us all.<br /><br />To aid further research -- as well as debate -- the book is meticulously foot noted and, for the convenience of practitioners, academics and students alike, there are copious tables of cases, treaties and legislation. So, the jury has gone out again with a new Bill of Rights committee, but it is a mixed record they are now reviewing.e: ideological and institutional.

185328873X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3U8V4TB5OK4R0]]A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO LIQUIDATION PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The second title in the Law Society's Insolvency Law Series, `Liquidation' sets out a clear step-by-step, start-to-finish guide to the most common corporate insolvency procedure: liquidation.  Having arisen and evolved from the historic need to protect investors from the consequences of business failure, liquidation, as the author points out, is `absolutely central to the UK insolvency regime and an essential branch of company and commercial law'.<br /><br />The author, Vernon Dennis, is an acknowledged expert in this often difficult and emotionally charged area, acting regularly for creditors, debtors and insolvency practitioners.  His prose is clear; his approach practical in 9 chapters with their `at a glance' guidance checklists in the appendices.<br /><br />With the reasoning behind the legislative framework highlighted throughout, the book's 200 pages provide invaluable practical advice for everyone and anyone who advises companies, directors, creditors, customers and suppliers to business who may be either undertaking or considering liquidation as a preferred insolvency procedure.<br /><br />The book covers the three forms of liquidation:  compulsory, creditors' voluntary and members' voluntary liquidation.  Although these processes are similar, the book specifically highlights and explains the differences.<br /><br />Logically structured, the book explains first the main characteristics and purpose of liquidation and offers advice on how to start the process.  The actual processes and procedures of liquidation are then examined in detail and analysis is provided on the implications of liquidation for the directors of the insolvent company and its creditors.  The final chapter deals with the various steps to be taken in ending the liquidation process.<br /><br />What makes this book impressively easy to use are the nine appendices we referred to earlier -- one for each chapter-- each outlining and summarizing by means of checklists and flowcharts, the author's succinct `at a glance' advice. Interestingly, the chart in Appendix 1 indicates that despite fluctuations, the total of corporate insolvencies in the UK rose from 12,856 in 1987 to 25,432 in 2009.<br /><br />No doubt this trend will continue, particularly if the economy remains less than buoyant - hence the need for this timely and authoritative book.<br /><br />To aid further research, there are lengthy tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, international statutory instruments and legislation, together with the appendices I have just mentioned, plus a useful glossary and index.  The publication date is 2011 and this short book is a little gem for the busy practitioner dealing with this vexed issue.ine appendices we referred to earlier -- one for each chapter-- each outlining and summarizing by means of checklists and flowcharts, the author's succinct `at a glance' advice.

B004NSULHM|3.0|Radiohead's \\"The King of Limbs\\" reminds me very much of some kind of 2011 version of Pink Floyd. There are wonderful moments in this soundscape but I am afraid that Radiohead is so afraid of sounding like the Bends that they offer these sounds leaving the listener to declare themselves cool by raving... or a fool by not being able to follow the trip. \\"The King of Limbs\\" is growing on me... I feel it be some kind of mix of Roger Waters and Neil Young lost at sea... this is not something to listen to as you dart about town running errands... but in the evening, with the house clean and the dog asleep... this is a kind walk through the headphones. I recommend this for hardcore fans, but then again who else is reading this anyway.

Part I - the coordination of Local Authority Enforcement -- deals with enforcement by primary as well as local authorities.  Part II -- The Civil Sanctions - explains how to obtain them, operate them and implement them.<br /><br />There's an interesting section here dealing with Natural England and the Environment Agency.  Part III -- Appeal and Judicial Review -- is followed by no less than seven appendices, notably Appendix 1, which sets out the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008, Schedules 3-7.<br /><br />From the few examples we've cited, you can see why this eminently `Practical Guide'  is of such immense help to practitioner and academic alike in making sense of sanctions and indeed all pertinent aspects of the current regulatory environment. As expected, the book contains tables of cases and legislation, including UK statutes and statutory instruments as well as international conventions. Published in 2011, it's reassuringly up to date as the only current commentary and very welcome for its opportune publication.cing with an introduction.

1597801585|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  I am always on the lookout for something different and unusual, and this book definitely fits that criteria nicely.  I also enjoy novels where the author either uses the minimum number of words to directly convey a point, like Hammett, or uses two dozen words where one could have done just fine, like Bacigalupi.    I do not want to go into great plot detail, dozens of other reviews have already done that.  I would simply suggest that you ask yourself if you are interested in a novel that dedicates pages upon pages of narrative to the inner workings and politics of the Megaladont Union and what is the real world equivalent of corporate espionage and commodities trading.

B004MKM8L8|5.0|wow! the sound on this film has blown me away, the best i have ever heard anywhere, even IMAX theaters.. I purchased this on BLU and am using a ps3 as my player, works perfectly. 7.1 surround and thx select2 cinema processing of multichannel PCM. viewed on an HD 120in front projection setup.. this has truly blown me away, the film is clear and the sound is astonishing.. it is enveloping and comes from everywhere.. the LFE effects are a tad low for cheap sub woofers; however, this is the best surround mix I have heard to date.. definitely reference quality and worth the price if only for the audio euphoria. Highly recommended. This is why blu-ray exists, A+    Those without surround sound are missing 80% of this film experience.
0670022411|2.0|I kind of thought this might be something like Lev Grossman's THE MAGICIANS from the plot summary.  More like a heftier Twilight.  Sappy, sappy romance.  I'm sure there is an audience for this type of novel, but it does not include me.

B0036EH3UC|4.0|SPOILER FREE REVIEW     BSG is a series that starts off brilliantly, maintains a decent pace, and offers a satisfactory conclusion that works with the entire body of work, which is not an easy thing to do.    There are the occassional plot holes but truthfully, it is impossible to do a project on the scale that BSG plays on without an occassional plot hole coming up.  However, the plotholes aren't glaringly bad.      Towards Season 4 and 4.5 the writers go to the well one too many times with a few of the plotlines and actions, but not to the point where you want to stop watching.      Overall, this represents a definitive work of Television Sci-Fi and is a must have for anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi.      Also, it should be noted that BSG will appeal to many who aren't fans of Sci-Fi since the majority of the storylines and plotlines are character centric.    The ending is a little anti-climatic but it works and is satisfying.    Good job guys, well done.  Writers, directors, actors, and fx guys should be proud of what they accomplished.  Well done...    amnightus

B001TODO54|1.0|It's a sad day for me when I have to stop reading a book because I can't overlook its problems and enjoy it. How in the world did this book get such a high rating in here? It's obviously targeted to a mature young-adult audience judging by the content but the way it's written seems to be for a younger audience in mind. One of the things that made me cringe whenever I read it were sentences that kept ending like this: \\"for no one liked the Graced\\", \\"for he was too weak...\\", \\"for Oll was Randa's spymaster\\", \\"for when the time came\\", \\"for her reputation spread like cancer\\", \\"for he was very tall\\" and so on and so on and so on. It may have been a stylistic choice but it started to grate on me and sounded lazy.      I wanted to like Katsa but I didn't and neither did I like Po. His name threw me off since I kept thinking of the big bald character named Po from the movie Mulan. However, many other reviewers have pointed out the other glaring defects that this book has in regards to character, plot, and names so I'll just stop here.

030726999X|5.0|Best of the three and that's saying something. A great read to the very end.<br /><br />For some reason Amazon requires that one write more than a few sentences for a review to post. I tried to submit the first two sentences alone but it didn't register. What more could possibly be said about these books that hasn't been written. I merely want to cast my 5 stars for this fantatic book in a blockbuster series that everybody I know has read, so, let's see if this will now post.<br /><br />I think it should be sufficient if a review merely states that a book was or was not appreciated. The publicity blurb and number of stars and votes combined is valuable information in itself. There will always be a plethora of indulgent and informative reviews.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This superlative film shows the infiltration of the STASI (Secret State Police) into the everyday lives of all East Germans.  I have had some personal contact with former Stasi Agents and dicussions about what this period in German history was like.  The film comes the closest to showing the absolute hegemony and terror that this agency held over all East Germans, from the bricklayer to the space scientist.  I strongly recommend it, in German (especially) or in English!<br />For those of you who see the creeping loss of liberty elsewhere, there are many lessons here.

B002ZCY7TG|1.0|I am writing this review because the Blu-ray 24: Season Eight set that I received is defective, but I didn't try to use is until after Amazon's 90-day return policy limit, therefore, I guess I have no recourse.  I paid $61.95 for the set.  This is very frustrating.  There apparently is no way to contact Amazon regarding this matter.  I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He didn't open it until a few days ago and the first disk could not read!  The second one did, but without the first disk, 6 hours of the season is missing.  Apparently because Amazon has a 90 day return policy and we are beyond the 90 days we have no recourse.  If someone can tell how to reach Amazon with comments, I would appreciate it.
0312370849|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars for entertainment value, as it kept me turning the pages, even if the literary devices to achieve this were not very sophisticated/subtle. Viewed as a commercial piece of work, \\"Sarah's Key\\" achieves its goal of keeping the reader reading. As a literary work, it falls short in style, depth, and, at times, description. \\"Suite Francaise\\" (quoted by author Tatiana de Rosnay) it is not. However, the novel reveals a momentous and horrendous event in Paris' occupied history that is worth bringing to light, if only to remind us of the inhumanity and injustice perpetrated on Jews during WWII. I'm sure the French can't be too happy about this reminder of some of their countrymen's collaboration with the Nazis under the Vichy govenment; and I think the author treads a delicate line, exposing the facts she has clearly researched extensively without painting too black a picture of those Parisians who turned a blind eye. Perhaps, the author being a journalist, a non-fictional account might have served much of the purpose of the book, but a novel no doubt was able to garner a wider readership and greater awarness of the \\"Vel' d'Hiv\\" horror. Also, I did appreciate the authenticity of the modern Paris setting and the often astute cultural observations.
067960085X|2.0|I was introduced to the writings of Truman Capote my freshman year of college. In Cold Blood was the title and the book was captivating.  A few months ago I came across the fact that Capote also wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's.  I don't know how I missed this considering the fact that I have watched  the movie several times.  Having read In Cold Blood, I just couldn't imagine Capote writing Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Needless to say my interest was sparked and I made a trip to the library to pick it up.<br /><br />My excitement was down to a fizzle after the first few pages.  The main character is Holly Golightly.  She goes down anything but lightly. She was hard to swallow.  Holly is aloof, insensitive, and lived in a fantasy land.  It was a few times I just wanted to shake her and say, \\"What planet are you on?\\" As you can tell I get wrapped up in these books.  The narrator who is a young writer Holly affectionately refers to as Fred lives in the same apartment complex with Holly and is soon caught in her web.  Most of the men that surround Holly are completely absorbed with her presence.  Even though they know she is living a total lie they still find themselves in awe of her.  I would even go as far as to say that Holly borders on some type of mental illness. She simply cannot deal with reality.  This book is full of eccentric characters that are quite flawed.  The storyline was so jumbled that a couple of times I just gave the pages a blank stare.<br /><br />This book was quite a letdown for me.  Capote's writing style was simple but a few times throughout the novel it was just senseless babble.  We all know that Capote was an open homosexual with a very outgoing and flamboyant personality which leads me to believe that Holly Golightly was his alter ego.

B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This is THE DEFINITIVE MOVIE for anyone who aspires to be an independent thinker. Some may think that Gary Cooper wasn't animated enough to carry forth the script written by Ayn Rand but it is her words that speak through anyone who plays the role of Howard Roark, the Architect and the independent thinking hero of creative thought in the film who is willing to sacrifice his career to insist on his ownership of his projects and his right to inspired independent creativity in the architectural design and building of his projects.<br />  Also woven into the script is the forbidden love affair between Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal which as biographers write, took place during this movie and after for many years. Their chemistry and their shared beliefs for the right to protect independent and original thought and ideas was well presented. The supporting cast was very believable; especially the unscrupulous newspaper columnist who boasted and then tried to ruin Howard Roark (Gary Cooper in the film) because Roark would not sell out his individuality. The newspaper owner played by Raymond Massey was also done well and entirely believable as well as Massey gives in to Roark's dedication to his architectural independence and winds up a broken man who takes his own life. The drama of the courtroom scene is where the words of Ayn Rand speak the strongest about the strength of individual thought and creative ideas and the right to the ownership of the aforementioned even if it means sacrificing everything and going to jail. Those words were undeniably Ayn Rand albeit spoken by Gary Cooper. Anyone who has read her books knows this.<br />  This is a timeless movie that you can enjoy again and again especially if you haven't seen it in a few years. The script and the book were entirely written by Ayn Rand who was on scene throughout the filming. She insisted on this prior to selling the book rights to film a motion picture which she also insisted on writing the script for. A brilliant movie.ant movie.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This is an awesome movie with tons of action.  Probably not for the light hearted, those who long for romance novels or those like some movies critics trying to find the meaning of life in movies but wow, the action is great.  This movie should do for the US Marine Corp what Top Gun did for Navel Aviation and it is long overdue.    At the end of the movie in the theater I was in the audience clapped they were so proud.  Knowing that there is a tough and rugged combat group like the Marines that are there to defend us all is reassuring.  And this movie gives you a little bit of a glimpse into what it might be like if something like this really happened!    There is an old saying that you can please some of the people all the time or all the people some of the time but you can't please all the people all the time.  It is disappointing & sad that there are those among us who put this movie down.  I strongly suspect they are the ones who have never seen real combat and truly don't understand the sacrifice of putting your life on the line for your country and your fellow Americans of all ages, even the ones that are the jerks!  Bottom line thou is in trying to decide who is right and who is wrong about how good the movie is, it was the number one (#1) movie when it came out and stayed that way for weeks!  Bad movies don't become #1, period!    Every bit of the movie was right on.  For all those who think it wasn't as great as it is, sorry you couldn't find the meaning of life in this movie, that was not what it was meant to be about!  For everyone else, hang on your going to like this ride;-)
B0000DZTIL|5.0|This is obviously no high tech, super Hollywood great but it is an awesome 80's classic. I remember watching this movie as a teenager and it was great. And now, very much older ;) it's still got the appeal of, good clean, save the world fun! Where the nerds and the cool kids unite and save the day. It's no Oscar winner but I just love it. No complications or up acting. Just pure entertainment and some awesome one liners. Sit back with some pop corn and enjoy the good old days with this great movie.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|There just aren't words to do justice to this show--it's smart, compelling, funny, educational. I watched it when it first aired, again when it was shown in reruns on Bravo, and bought the DVD's one season at a time, as they came out. I learn something new every time I watch the DVD's.     The stories were stunning and the acting superb!  I really miss the characters--they became like family. If you've missed out, do yourself a favor and start with season 1.

B000002L1L|4.0|I have heard that this record was one of, if not the, worst records Deep Purple released.  Sure they were having internal issues in the band.  Reviewers have stated that it lacked inspiration and that they released this record because they were under contract to do it.  Whatever the case may be, overall the record rocks.  It sounds like classic DP and rocks just as hard.  I give it four stars (really 3.5) because of the blatant rip off of some of their own riffs from earlier and better songs.  One is obvious (listen to the record -- you'll know it when you hear it) but the others aren't so obvious b/c Blackmore changed them up just enough to make them sound more original than they are.  Lyrically, tracks 1-9 are excellent.  They flow very well.  The last track, however, is just stupid.  They could have left it off and released it as a B-side to whatever they chose as their single.  They could have taken the original B-side and put that as track 10.  It had to have been better. However, that said, it is a better record than I expected.  It sounds like Deep Purple, just not a very inspired Deep Purple.  [[ASIN:B000025JJ4 Battle Rages on]]

B004SBX112|1.0|i have to dump amazon just to get an update, and that sucks! there should have been someone to montior what is going on. amazon snagged rio, and a lot of android was happy to have a new outlet, but amazon is droping the ball on one of the best apps out their. once you disappoint people they dont like to give second chances.

B003Y059EK|3.0|Forget all that you know about Judy Garland and her yellow brick road. Instead pick up the original books and read them before you take this adventure. Otherwise you will be left wondering who these characters are and how they pertain to the classic movie. I have always loved this because it is true to the original story. I gave this three stars because the sound was horrible. I had to adjust everything on my computer and internet settings just to get a whisper out of it. Forget about subtitles too. Otherwise I might have upped the stars. I attempted to look on Amazon Instant Video for added help and after an hour I gave up and sent a regular email. Still have yet to hear from them which is abnormal for the company in my past experiance. Do not attempt to watch this movie in a slightly noisy area, including the bathroom.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I received the Kindle version of this book and it worked flawlessly. The book itself is probably the best written book I have read in 10 years. I looked forward everyday to reading it again. McDougall does a great job of mixing story with character development. Also very inspiring to go out on a run. My only complaint if any is that the price of the Kindle edition is more than the paperback version, however, you can get it on your Kindle in 30 seconds verses waiting for delivery so in that sense it is worth the 70 cents price difference.

B000LPS4BG|5.0|This is without a doubt the best modern film about the mafia ever. It takes into the \\"life\\" and shows the high high's and the dangerous lows through the eyes of Henry Hill, the real life inspiration behind the story. It is indeed a glorious time as we go through a quarter of a century with this man, played to perfection by Ray Liotta. I don't want to spoil to much, but this is absolutely worth your time, and don't call me funny.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|A super sweet slice-of-life film, with a killer folk soundtrack.  He's lovely, and her voice will blow you away.  I listened to this disc to death after seeing the film at the cinema, and must drag it out again now!
B0017M8XS6|3.0|I am glad that I was able to listen to the Anniversary Edition \\"Previously Unreleased\\" version of Karn Evil 9 3rd Impression, before I invested money in this CD set.     Here I was all set to hear a \\"different mix\\" of this tune, and, discover that the only thing that is \\"different\\" about it is that someone has fiddled around with the speed settings, and in different parts of this song, made it appear that ELP played it faster, when this isn't the case at all. Whoever made this CD took this song, and, without changing the actual pitch of the song, speeded up the tempo, which is something so simple that you can do this with your Windows Media Player! What's that about, and why the rip off? I was very happy to hear the \\"backing track\\" of Karn Evil 9 3rd Impression, which is excellent, but this is a whole different story.  If EL&P didn't give the \\"OK\\" for this to be released, then, if I were them( yes, I know I'm not them, but that is beside the point)I would be doing some investigating to find out who did this, and why.      When it comes to this song, no one( not even ELP) can pull anything over on me, without my noticing it. I'll just tell you that, here and now. For the past 38 years, I have listened to this song at least once a day, sometimes more within any given day.      So, any one who might buy this \\"Deluxe Edition\\", simply for the different recordings of Karn Evil 9 3rd Impression, it is worth having it for the \\"Backing Track\\" version, but don't expect anything from this so-called \\"Previously Unreleased\\" version, except a screwed up recording of it.
B004SC7B6M|3.0|while i do still enjoy sharon's vocals, the lyrics in this new cd are beyond corny. it makes sense they were written for a comic book. i loved \\"heart of everything\\" with songs like \\"frozen\\" that were gorgious and touched your heart. or even 'the howling\\" that made you wanna go kill an ogre but this cd, most of the songs, sadly, blend together in a bad way. very few songs stand out and the lyrics are like a middle schooler's bad poetry. very disappointed.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Watched the the various snippets of the 25th anniversary show in London on youtube.  Purchased this blu-ray DVD on impulse.  Wow!  Outstanding.  Excellent Sound.  Great Cast, and the encores were great.    If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, this is a must have DVD.    Also, if you have the DVD but have not seen the snippet of Bring Him Home encore with the 4 tenors on youtube.com, check it out.  The snippet from someones phone had better angles than the DVD.  The DVD would change back and forth from camera angles and would not have all 4 in same screen shot.  The snippet from someones phone had all 4 in the same shots.  Really priceless singing.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This installment is definitely darker than the rest of them, and it works. This one is not for the hardcore nerds, or kiddies, but rather those into the characters and drama. Standouts are Harry and Hermione, who take this movie to the next level with their interaction and angst. There were definitely some Mulder/Scully moments there. Cinematically, this was also the strongest; with a more adult feel.
0307887960|4.0|In the wake of the new popularity of the HCG diet--where either injections or a homeopathic substitute for the HCG hormone is administered to the body which enables the consumption of a near starvation diet of 500 calories per day--I look favorably at plans like the Dukan Diet as a more sensible, long-term alternative regime for healthful living.  I have been an advocate of Jana Klauer's real food diet, \\"[[ASIN:B002KE482U How the Rich Get Thin: Park Avenue's Top Diet Doctor Reveals the Secrets to Losing Weight and Feeling Great]]\\" for over six years.  As a medical doctor who teaches her patients the art of sensible eating, she has a good grasp on what works, what is healthy and how to maintain it, despite her market introduction of a signature, albeit nasty tasting, diet drink (which, in my opinion negates the whole idea of eating real food rather than relying on a packaged gimmick.)  Klauer emphasizes the importance of calcium with each meal and whether or not this is substantiated by any scientific study or not, I have found that it works for me.<br /><br />At first glance, \\"The Dukan Diet,\\" by Dr. Pierre Dukan, a medical practitioner in France, seems to be an Atkins offshoot.  However, I hardly think this is the case as Dukan, like Klauer, suggests consuming high quality protein and little fat for optimal weight loss and health.  Shucks! No bacon to be found here. Where Klauer suggests primarily the leanest and most pure forms of protein--egg whites, non-fat dairy products (indeed, some may argue that dairy is a combination of proteins and carbohydrates) and fish for the first stage of her regime, Dukan allows more variety--his definition of protein for the first \\"Attack\\" phase of his plan consists of lean meats which include beef and organ meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, ham &lt;wow>, eggs, and non-fat dairy.  Fattier meats like pork are included only in their leanest forms.<br /><br />Whereas, Klauer's Phase 1 continues until the dieter is within five pounds of their goal weight, the duration of Dukan's Attack phase can run from as little as one day to ten days depending upon how much weight one must lose, and how many failed diets the dieter participated in during their dieting history.  Once the initial `Attack' jumpstart is completed, meaning only protein as defined by Dukan and a limited amount of oat bran is consumed, the dieter graduates to the \\"Cruise\\" step--where unlimited green, not starchy, vegetables are added to the mix.  It is in this phase, that the dieter continues, alternating a day of pure protein with a day of protein plus greens, until goal weight is achieved.<br /><br />Klauer's second phase is similar to Dukan's \\"Consolidation\\" step where a health-promoting eating style is continued with the reintroduction of foods that were restricted in the first phases.  Klauer allows chicken and beef to be added in the first week of her maintenance preparation phase.  As the weeks go on, she includes fruits, grains, nuts etc, gradually allowing the body to readapt to what it missed and eventually leveling off at goal weight.  Dukan explains that the length of this phase is dependent on the amount of weight lost by the dieter.  For example, if twenty pounds were lost, this phase will last 100 days--five days for every pound lost.  Dukan strongly feels that the body's first inclination after losing fat storages will be to replenish them.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance to ease back into an everyday eating plan without giving the body the opportunity to rebound.  Dukan allows starchy foods, fruits (no bananas, raisins or cherries), cheese, whole grain bread and lean lamb and pork roasts at this point, but strictly enforces that in each week one day is still set aside for pure protein only.  He claims that most people disregard this phase of dieting, and unfortunately regain most, if not more, of the weight they strove so hard to lose.  Two celebratory `eat whatever you want' meals are also allowed in this phase.<br /><br />Dukan's last phase is \\"Stabilization\\" which I interpret as `mindful eating.'  Being aware of what you eat is as important as the gasoline that racecar pilots use in their high-priced vehicles for optimal performance.  If you want your body to run at peak perfection, give it the best fuel--chips and French fries are delicious, but don't give you the mileage that you need to live fully within your 24 hour per day time slot.<br /><br />For this final phase that lasts for the remainder of your life, Dukan recommends keeping the ideas of his \\"Consolidation\\" in mind while making food choices that will include each food group.  For example, when eating eggs consider egg whites instead of the whole egg, non-fat dairy instead of whole and fish instead of beef.  He insists that one day a week continue to be a \\"protein only\\" day.  Oat bran consumption is upped to three tablespoons per day.  And, of course, flushing the body with water and keeping it well oiled with exercise is the no-brainer approach to a good life.<br /><br />Dukan's book devotes some time to the discussion of women's hormonal changes and how these affect weight and the effectiveness of diet.  Using myself as the only benchmark for my remarks, I find that following the dieting premises of Jana Klauer, Ann Louise Gittleman ([[ASIN:0071383832 The Fat Flush Plan]]) or Pierre Dukan will result in success no matter what your age.  Vigilance is key--selecting good food that benefits your body is paramount.  Unfortunately eating junk--food that your body really doesn't need to function--will result in your looking like you eat junk.  And that ultimately provides the bottom line:  You are what you eat--if you wish to indulge--by all means, do so.  However, be aware that you will look as if you do.<br /><br />In addition, as you wean yourself off unnecessary foods, you will find that you don't need as much food to accomplish what you wish.  Junk is addictive; it makes you want more.  Portion control with real food will naturally occur as your program of `mindful' eating progresses.<br /><br />Personally, I find Klauer and Gittleman's plans more doable; they, however, are portion controlled which may be more difficult for those who are used to eating what they want, whenever.  I say this, because, pure protein even for a limited amount of time for some may disturb the digestive system--surely the oat bran helps, but some salads and green vegetables make such moves much smoother.  If you decide to go the Dukan route, check out Teavana's Dieter's Tea--a blend of caffeinated teas that will aid with this problem.  Drink before 2 PM as the caffeine may keep you from having a good night's sleep.<br /><br />In the past, I have recommended raw food plans that push a variety of green juices and a large consumption of fruits and vegetables.  Without the addition some protein, these diets weakened me.  My digestive track did work well, but I was unable to work out in the way that I like without feeling sore.  The additional diary and protein help me immensely.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"The Dukan Diet\\" is definitely a step above the fad diets that are advertised nightly on infomercials and hawked relentlessly on the Internet. With thirty years experience, French doctor, Pierre Dukan tells the dieter what works in simple language that is easy to understand.  For those who like \\"[[ASIN:0375710515 French Women Don't Get Fat]],\\" look at Dukan's plan as its prequel--the step that will get you ready for Guiliano's plan.

If you do not like the kindle, make a thread for it.  I rate the book five star for the adult presentation.  It is not for the reader who wants the author to tell them what they should be thinking.  The author here requires close attention to plot, movation of character, and second story lines.  it is a good book.  Again, KIndle, and pricing.. god.   come on folk.  it is a place here for a review of the book.  again, make a thread and discuss the kindle pricing and such.  thanks.
B0008ENIAC|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who believe that films must remain 'faithful' to their source material should take a look at the original 1945 film version of 'Mildred Pierce'; it's an example of the 'right' way to adapt a novel into a screenplay. Contrast it with the turgid, long-winded 2011 HBO version of 'Pierce'. There's actually no comparison: the 1945 version is wholly entertaining while the recent adaptation will bore you to tears.<br /><br />Mildred Pierce was the perfect vehicle for Joan Crawford. Ironically here she plays a mother whose love is pretty much unconditional toward her bad seed daughter Veda (in real life, however, Crawford used 'tough love' on her own children with disastrous results). Unlike the novel (and the recent HBO Version), the noirish murder scene constitutes the inciting incident and linchpin of the entire plot.<br /><br />The break into the Second Act begins during the police interrogation as Mildred recounts her break up with husband Bert and quest for financial independence. When a waitress is fired during an argument with another waitress over tips, Mildred just happens to be in the right place at the right time and is hired on the spot. It's these neat little scenes that add to the overall verisimilitude of the plot.<br /><br />Act two introduces us to Mildred's conflict with Wally, Bert's former real estate partner and daughter Veda. As for Wally--he's distinctively played by Jack Carson as the seedy salesman who can't resist trying to putting his paws all over Mildred (he's a serial groper!). Ann Blyth is brilliant, making the most of the chief supporting players' part, as the evil Veda. The character is so over the top that one can scarcely believe there are people like this in real life. Veda can't control her contempt for her mother and yes teenagers often do rebel against parental authority; but the disdain is usually a lot more subtle than what we see here. Still, Veda's exaggerated (and escalating) misbehavior is what makes the film so enjoyable (there is a catharsis of sorts as the audience gets to 'hiss the villain').<br /><br />If there is one sentimental sequence 'Mildred Pierce', it's when younger daughter Ray contracts pneumonia and dies. The scene is a bit drawn out but provides an explanation for Mildred's continuing attachment to Veda--the loss of Ray causes Mildred to try and protect the only child she has left!<br /><br />The stakes get higher in Act 2. Monte is temporarily thrown 'under the bus' when he refuses Mildred's request not to indulge Veda and stay away from her. Then Veda goes ahead and cons her new husband and his mother out of $10,000 by pretending that she's pregnant. There's that great iconic scene where Veda ends up slapping Mildred and she throws her out of the house. Meanwhile, Mildred finds success in the restaurant business by opening up a chain of restaurants. Should I mention that Mildred's former supervisor Ida (deliciously played by Eve Arden) is the comic relief with her sassy comments about men. Leave it to kind-hearted Bert (who finally has gotten his act together), to bring Veda and Mildred back together. This happens when he brings Mildred to a seedy nightclub where Veda now works as a low rent singer.<br /><br />The dark moment of Act 2 occurs after Mildred agrees to marry Monte and give him one third of the business (she does this to perhaps improve her social standing in Veda's eyes). Monte betrays Mildred by selling his share of the business along with Wally, which bankrupts her. The ultimate indignity of course is that Monte begins an affair with Veda.<br /><br />What makes Mildred Pierce so engaging is that not only is Veda damaged goods but so is Mildred. She's willing to send an innocent man to jail to save her daughter when she tries to set up Wally as the killer.<br /><br />Note that the story is not without a few false notes. How can the police arrest Bert at the beginning of the film? Yes, they have his gun and no denial that he was responsible; but they don't actually have a confession, so the evidence seems rather flimsy. Then there's the ending itself--the murder feels a bit tacked on as if the screenwriter couldn't come up with something more creative and needed to rush things to an almost immediate conclusion. It's really not much of a twist ending as Monte's murder seems rather predictable.<br /><br />Despite the minor pitfalls, 'Mildred Pierce' remains a highly entertaining part noir, part soap opera, that manages to thrill audiences even to this day.ave a confession, so the evidence seems rather flimsy.

1400096936|4.0|I'll spare you the plot summary, there are enough of those already.  The Power of the Dog is an engaging and frightening fictional look at the very real war on drugs going on in Mexico.  Every time I open the newspaper and read a real story about police being detained in Mexico for being on the drug lord's payroll, or mass execution-style murders, it reminds me how accurate Winslow is in this book.  His characters are tightly entwined, and he makes you empathize, if not sympathize, with most of them by painting vivid pictures of life from their individual perspectives.  There is a lot of violence, and at times it gets pretty steamy, both adding to the flavor of the story.<br /><br />My only criticism, and it is minor one, is it felt like one too many rounds fought between protagonist and antagonist.  Winslow said what needed to be said, the characters had all been completely developed, and the book felt ready for the climax about 50 to 100 pages before it hit.  But like I said, that is a minor flaw, as all in all it was great read.<br /><br />I enjoy fiction based on real events; and Winslow hit a solid triple with me on this one.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception takes very complex concepts and makes them believable and digestible to even those not into the sci-fi genre. The idea that dreams can be manipulated to impact our life is pretty deep and I wondered if the filmmakers could pull it off. The result of their effort is a movie that is expertly written and expertly acted. The bonus comes in the form of special effects that are astounding, done not just for the sake of doing them, but to add force to the story. I recommend you dedicate some focus to this movie (kick \\"movie talkers\\" out of the room) and enjoy this spectacular film. Then, enjoy special features that help you learn how those special effects were actually created. Last note, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ken Watannabe are stellar!
0525422943|5.0|Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. I've read books about love and books about heartbreak and sacrifice, but none of them have amounted to the literary beauty of Where She Went. Books don't need to be action-packed or filled with complex plots to be considered a \\"great read.\\" Instead, they can have two characters, both with deeply instigating personalities and a passion for opposite types of music. Throughout my teenage life, I've acquired a taste for both rock and classical, and it makes my heart swell with enchantment when I see the two styles resonating to create a cacophony of emotions.     Adam and Mia were an unlikely high school couple who've now gone their separate ways in life. Mia's accident brought them close, but then it pushed them apart. Adam, whose band has hurled into the depths fame, is living the life of a rockstar. Mia's life couldn't have been more different. She's a child prodigy in the world of classical music whose career is only beginning. One last fateful night in New York City leaves them both reminiscing about the past, enduring the present, and fighting their way into an uncertain future. Adam promised Mia he'd doing anything for her if only she'd stay. But for Mia, leaving would have been so much easier than staying.    Usually, I'm no fan of romances involving careless and shallow teenagers in love. But Adam and Mia are different. Despite their youth, their love was the kind that reached into the soul and bonded together for eternity. All the suffering they've endured was the kind of passion and pain that fueled their lives emotionally. Their music, their life, and their love was in completely harmony. And that in itself presented a beautiful and complicated obstacle for two polar opposites meant to attract. There's something about Gayle Forman's writing that's hauntingly elegant. In the midst of her story, I'd sometimes find myself stopping just to relish the poetry-like descriptions, or to soak in the radiant flood of overwhelming emotions. I found myself completely engulfed in the wave of grief and hope that was the foundation of Adam and Mia's relationship. Towards the last few chapters, I nearly felt my heart shattering at Mia's proposition of closure. For a moment, their friendship seemed to hang in a delicate balance. One look could send them down opposite sides of a bridge, while it could also send them crashing into one another's arms. The ending, however, was a song that still echoes in the back of my mind. I have never read a book more poetic, pure, and musical. It was stunning. It was painful. It was beautiful. It was the strings of an electric guitar and a cello playing in harmony.     -Carina L. Tai  [...]
B00122HPDU|5.0|Michael Buble chooses a wonderful mix of standards to cover with a smooth crooner's voice that has a sound all its own. The level of emotion he puts into songs, be they slow, fast, sad, or happy makes him one of my favorite vocal artists.  If you want a set of classic songs to relax and tap your foot to (and maybe even add your own voice to), you will not be disappointed with this collection by Michael Buble.
1416972242|5.0|Book Two in the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare continues the tale of Clary, Jace, Isabella, Alec, and Simon as they band together to fight against Valentine, a rogue Shadow Hunter who has twisted ideas on how the world should be. In this story, Valentine is hunting other Downworlders (werewolves, vampires, fae, and warlocks) to obtain his twisted goals with Mortal Instruments he has stolen. There is pulse pounding action and incredulity at the villian in his twisted efforts to monopolize those around him. The young Shadowhunter's lives hang in the balance at the end of this tale and has the reader anxiously biting his/her nails while screeching.<br /><br />Cassandra's ability to to weave a tale of strong characters, evil creatures, and the human condition is astounding. I wish I could write a book as well as she does. Again, this book would stand up to any adult paranormal fiction out there. I highly recommend this book to any Paranormal or Urban Fantasy Genre fan.<br /><br />Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!
0446195529|5.0|Love any and everything Baldacci.  I had not read any previous Camel Club books until Divine Justice, but had read other Baldacci books and fell in love with him beginning with First Family.  I have read the books out of sequence, but they are basically stand alone books even though some characters return time and again.  I usually don't like that about an author, but Baldacci does it so well and the Camel Club is up to their usual, close in the ranks and call in the troops to save one of their own.  This one involves the British Prime Minister and the English counter-part to Oliver Stone and one heck of a plot.  It is assumed the the Prime Minister iswas the target of an assassination attempt that begins with a bombing in a park across the street from the embassy that kills a suposed innocent,what unfolds is much, much more diabolical (but of course it is).  I couldn't put the book down and of course truth, justice and the American Way (or at least in the Camel Club's World)triumph.
1416955070|5.0|I am going to keep this review short and sweet...<br /><br />This book starts out with teen-aged Clary Fray witnessing a murder in the Pandemonium Club. From there the action is non-stop. Clary and her best friend, Simon, are thrown into the world of Shadowhunters, Vampires, Werewolves, and Demons. This tale supplies mystery, a budding romance, excellent character building, and heart-stopping revelations. Cassandra Clare is a phenomenal writer! Her imagination is amazing. This YA novel can stand against any Adult Paranormal or Urban Fantasy Fiction offered on any bookshelves.
B00436GNVC|1.0|Had limited experience with Duffy, but heard a few songs of hers on Pandora radio.   Bought this CD and was very disappointed in this effort.  Her voice is so babyish and the songs sound like a 1950's tribute, it is difficult to listen to.    Wish I had read others reviews before wasting my money.  Save your money, pass this CD by.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|THis is a awesome album by all great artist. If you like soulful vocals and hard rocking blues music!!!!! This is for you pick it up asap!!!! I'm a huge Glenn Hughes fan and he shines on this project. I just hope it's not a one album deal!!!!

0316069353|2.0|the ending was awful. Can anyone tell me why the victim was killed, a reason that makes sense? And the final twist is just lazy. Are we left with a future of \\"Law and Order\\"? Harry then Mickey? Please is there any reason for the bad guy to go to all the trouble that is necessary, for what? Does a lawyer become a rat? Bad, bad, bad.
B003L20ICE|4.0|There is a lot to like in this story. I've long been a fan of Benning. And she turns in another excellent performance. I thought the story resonated. The movie is at its center about challenges, being human, growing up and learning to deal/live with the rough edges of life.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Amazon is evil. Initially, I just wanted to get a battery for my Canon 7D. Then, Amazon suggested me to get this too. I didn't think and I got it. The battery grip will complete will your camera. Even if you don't need it, GET IT.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Downloaded this last night to help pass the time.  Its pretty fun and mildly challenging. finished it in about 50 minutes though. good thing its only $.99!  Give it a go if you were a fan of point and click adventure games back in the day!
0439796644|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this heartwarming story from a horses perspective.  It gave me a brief picture of the hardships endured by the soldiers of World War I but also told a beautiful story of compassion and care of military horses by those same brave soldiers.
B004J713JW|2.0|This is an outstanding concert.  Billy Joel is indeed a master musician/songwriter.   His band is the best although like many others, I do miss Liberty, but this drummer is a close equal.   But I must agree with Capt RB and K Morris.   The mix must be fixed.   This Blu-ray should be a cherished record of a great career.  Instead, those who have spent a fortune on high end gear have trouble listening to it.   I have many concert DVDs and Blu-rays  by artists I don't revere as much as Billy Joel, and their mixes make this pale by comparison.   I am waiting for someone to come clean and release the corrected version.  I will gladly buy it.
0307477479|1.0|...more important it is impossible to identify with these characters. I got sooooooo bored and finally returned the book to Amazon. What could the Pulitzer Prize committee been thinking of? They should have given the award to Henning Mankell for \\"The Troubled Man.\\"
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|This series is great to tell a part of the pacific part of WWII.  The stories are great and it is part of history that we do not hear a lot about.  everyone knows the battles of Europe during WWII but there was another war going on in the Pacific that was completely different.  If you are a Band of Brothers fan you will like it but you must remember that it is a completely different story altogether.      The battle in the Pacific was bad in all ways.  We were not use to the land and also we were not ready for an enemy that will never give up unless they were dead.  They Japanese are very loyal to country and fight with honor, their lives were not as important as the life of their country.  The Pacific shows what the US went through during the horrific war.     The series has great reenactments of major battles in the war.  you see the war in the eyes of 3 separate people fighting for the US marines.   Worth watching more than once.    The Blu ray is great.  I had to buy a DVD copy as well so I could let friends and family watch it.
1593083246|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Austen's second,most well know,and my favorite novel.The story starts when a rich young man named Mr. Bingley rents a house in the neighborhood.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|Love watching the Glee 1st season.  It has become a family event.  Bought it for my daughter's 11th birthday and now the whole family is hooked.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|It took me 4 weeks after purchasing to quit listening to this so much, very rare for me. It is difficult to put AWOL into any one category so some listeners may not like him but that is exactly what I love about him. This CD is a great first full length release and worth every penny (more actually). If you get a chance to see them live, wear earplugs and get ready to move! Fantastic!
B000000YG5|4.0|After repeatedly seeing this album mentioned as Rollins' best as well as a jazz masterpiece, I ordered it and listened to it several times with pleasure. After repeated listenings, however, I've begun to question the basis for this seemingly universal high praise.<br /><br />Certainly, more than a few jazz critics rate the album very highly. For example, Joe Goldberg, in his [[ASIN:B003477HA2 Jazz Masters of the Fifties]], states: \\"This LP, recorded with Roach, bassist Doug Watkins, and pianist Tommy Flanagan, is notable for two tracks, Moritat and Blue 7. With the latter piece, serious criticism of Rollins' work began. In the first issue of the highly influential Jazz Review, Gunther Schuller called Blue 7 'an example of a real variation technique. The improvisation is based not only on a harmonic sequence but on a melodic idea as well... what Sonny Rollins has added conclusively to the scope of jazz improvisation is the idea of developing and varying a main theme, and not just a secondary motive or phrase which the player happens to hit upon in the course of his improvisation and which in itself is unrelated to the 'head' of the composition.' \\"<br /><br />As for Moritat, Goldberg has nothing in particular to say. Personally, though, Mac the Knife is not one of my favorite older tunes and Rollins' improvisations do not make the standard any more pleasurable for me. Additionally, Rollins' bouncy, Carribbean-tinged tune, St Thomas, while light-hearted and with an infectious beat, wears rather thin upon repeated listenings.<br /><br />The masterwork on the album is indeed Blue 7, which I like a lot, but had jazz historian/composer Gunther Schuller not written his influential article, I suspect that it would remain among the many warmly appreciated but largely unheralded jazz compositions from the 1950s.<br /><br />Despite my personal idiosyncracies, still a highly recommended CD for fans of Sonny Rollins and fans of 1950s jazz.
B000SEIDR0|4.0|As I read each chapter I was more and more disturbed by what I learned. I did lots of fact checking where I could too, man, sad to say this book pegs where we are today in relation to our unhealthy food supply, the shape we are leaving our planet in and the bad politics taking us merrily down the path to destruction. There is hope but more of us need to be informed, you won't be sorry you read this one at all...it may help you make some personal changes for healthier living!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|It's probably no accident that this fast-paced, atmospheric movie has the feel of a '30's serial about it.  Set in a rather murkily-defined alternate world where dirigibles like the Hindenburg III still cruise the skies and World War II apparently took place well before it happened in our reality (and without Hitler), it finds intrepid \\"girl newshound\\" Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and mercenary pilot Sky Captain (Jude Law) trying to fight through a past romantic history while attempting to find out who's responsible for the disappearance of a laundry list of European scientists and the creation of an array of sophisticated giant robots attacking New York City.  When the Captain's head mechanic Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) manages to isolate the region from which the robots' orders are being dispatched, he's kidnapped from his base, and now the hunt becomes personal.  With the help of Frankie (Angelina Jolie), the eye-patched commanding officer of a British airborne station, Polly and the Captain eventually track down the mysterious Dr. Totenkopf (Sir Laurence Olivier), only to discover that things aren't everything they seem.  With a nice mix of futuristic and '30's-era gadgetry and great digital SFX, this movie should appeal to anyone who enjoys the Indiana Jones franchise, [[ASIN:B0038ZITIE Flash Gordon]], or the original [[ASIN:B000EHQTZO King Kong]].  Fans should also like the soundtrack [[ASIN:B0002VEPIA Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]] and the novelization [[ASIN:0451411633 Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]].
B002VRZEYM|5.0|There is nothing much more to say, everyone must watch it, and make a decision for themselves on where they stand, but this is the most important issue of our time, food like water... is our lifeline.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Rarely does film-making come in as solid a package as it does in Tom Hooper's THE KING'S SPEECH.  You have top-notch directing; perfect casting; an engaging script; beautiful cinematography; and a story with a lot of room for emotional interpretation.  It concerns Bertie--soon to be King George VI--and his stammer, and the Australian linguist hired to cure him.<br /><br />What's so surprising about SPEECH is that there's little surprise here; everything is just as you would expect it to be (except for the cursing scenes, which come as a pleasant change of pace).  And yet, the film comes off smoothly, from the stellar lead performances (another fine turn from Colin Firth, and Geoffrey Rush at his best) to the minor roles (a superb Helena Bohnam Carter as the future queen, an under-used Guy Pearce as Bertie's brother, and Michael Gambon as their father).  This is a near-flawless film, which is perhaps its only flaw; it could stand to be a little grittier, a little less predictable.  But it's hard to complain when a film hits all the right emotional buttons.  It's too soon to tell THE KING'S SPEECH will be a classic, but it will definitely go down as a fine piece of cinematic integrity.
B004SBX112|3.0|....when the ad version gets the updates first?! sorry, but does that make sense? and of course i cant update it in the market! amazon get the lead out!
B004SBX112|1.0|failure to update this app ontime means you are going to get a one star rating every time.  issue the update for the paid version like the free version, and maybe i'll change my rating.
0765326353|5.0|conceptually complete  intrigue, adventure, great fantasy concepts and devices.  characters that come alive.  vivid descriptions and landscapes.  I loved it
B001TODO54|5.0|Originally posted at Inklings Read: [...]<br /><br />The story was very well written! Cashore did a great job describing the characters and setting without being over descriptive or tiring as some authors do with fantasy books.<br /><br />Katsa was a great character to observe! She starts out as having no control over her life. Yes, she has a very powerful grace, but it is her king, who is also her uncle, that controls her. She revolts and we watch her become her own person, no longer willing to inflict punishment on those who don't deserve it. It is also interesting to watch her inner struggle, thinking of herself as a monster for having her grace. She is a very complex and strong character that never once bored me.<br /><br />The entwined love story in this seemed to progress naturally and I really fell in love with and rooted for the characters!<br /><br />I highly recommend this. It's a quick read (at least it was for me). Check it out if you get a chance. I was in torn between giving 4 or 5 stars for this one, but because I liked the concept so much I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />As a sidenote: The UK cover with the girl standing is so much better than the US cover.. Very jealous.
B00402FGE4|2.0|Not the best of the Stargate series, hence the end of the show on May 9th after only 2 seasons. The premise in part was taken from Star Trek Voyager where a crew and ship are out millions of mile away from Earth and have to find a way home. Sadly this series was slow and dealt with more of the conflicts between crew members who were at odds with one another rather than all working together to find a way home. Many thought they would encounter more aliens or other life forms than what was presented but somehow the writers couldn't get their act together on this this either.   To top it off, SYFY Network had a very very bad habit of not only with this series but other original series on its network in only showing 10 episodes then taking it off for 4 to 6 months or even a year (Think Eureka season 4 1st half last summer, 2nd half this summer)then bringing it back to finish off the season. too long a break, people either loose interest or have to jump started to remember where we were at let off.    In this case the long break and slowness add to the demise of this series. If one owns all the other Stargate shows then one gets it to add it to the collection, so you have the entire series. Other than that forget it.Too bad there will be no more Stargates would liked to have had another SG-1 movie or even Atlantis movie, but such is not to be. Season 2 no doubt will out by the end of the year.
0811879542|5.0|LOL - okay, the wonderful review before mine is so chock full of great information on the book that I don't know how I can compare.  (I think the review is longer than the book!)  Truly a great review, so I'll just move onto reaction to book.<br /><br />I'm the mom of a 3-year-old daughter.  I wasn't sure how she would react to the book.  There are no cute characters.  No flaps to lift.  No scratch and smell, lights, music or holograms.  LOL - it's truly a book!  And it's made up of primary colors, circles, and basic sentences - that's it.<br /><br />So, I put her on my lap and began to read.  Did she like it?  Well, we had to read it 8 times the first night, 7 times the second night, 10 times the third night, etc., etc., etc.  She hasn't gotten tired of it yet.<br /><br />This morning, my daughter had a doctor's appointment.  As we sat in the waiting room, I took the book out and we began to read.  Within moments, we were surrounded by every other child in the waiting room as they watched and listened in fasciation.<br /><br />This is truly a wonderful little book that proves imagination is more important and more effective than batteries!<br /><br />*-*-*-*-<br />Product Update 11/16/13<br /><br />Well, my daughter is now 5 1/2 years old.  As many books do, this one eventually ended up on a shelf filled with many other books.  We're packing for a move and Press Here came to light again.  I told my daughter that it had been her favorite book when younger, so she asked me to read it to her.<br /><br />My voice was soon tired as we had to read it six times in one sitting.  Though she's old enough that the book doesn't seem quite so 'magic' anymore, she was still delighted with it.  And even in her five-year-old wisdom, she did need to take a moment just to ask me if the book really was doing things when she pressed.<br /><br />She's now shared the book with her kindergarten class and the kids keep asking her to bring it back.<br /><br />And reading it again, I was just as delighted as I was the first time.st as delighted as I was the first time.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This young lady is going to be the next greatest female vocalist of all time! An incredible voice, a remarkable collection of songs, including classic covers... You can't go wrong. As good as this one is, her more recent album 21 is even better!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|What's not to love about a horse story especially one that's based on a true account?  I remember the days of Secretariat.  The American people were in love with a horse, rooting for the underdog. The Vietnam war was still being fought and the country was divided but people of all kinds were wanting Big Red to win.<br /><br />The casting is perfect.  Diane Lane plays the housewife/owner of the magnificent horse with great feeling, John Malkovich plays the quirky trainer, Margo Martindale (Mags Bennett of \\"Justified\\") has a smaller but very memorable role, and there are quite a few other name actors scattered throughout the movie including Scott Glenn and James Cromwell.<br /><br />This is a wonderful family movie - about winning and losing, women's roles in the family and in business, about determination and fighting for what you truly believe in.
B003E8GQ76|1.0|I work in the aerospace industry, and I usually love any kind of movies even remotely related to aviation.  I've also liked a lot of George Clooney's other movies, so I thought this would be worth paying the $5 to download on-demand.  I was wrong about that!  It was a snooze-fest.  Long and dull.  I would wait until you can stream it on Netflix for free.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Non-stop action from the very start.  You would think with an entire movie about a runaway train that there would be some spots that would lag - but not so.  The action just keeps coming in this movie.<br /><br />Casting was perfect.  Denzel Washington - need I write more?  Chris Pine, a favorite since the latest Star Trek movie.  Rosario Dawson and Kevin Corrigan didn't have huge roles as Connie, the yardmaster and Inspector Werner but they were vital, well-played roles.  Kevin Dunn played a slimeball in charge, which he always does well.<br /><br />It is very frightening to think that this movie is loosely based on a true story that happened in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />I love this type of movie - reminded me of [[ASIN:B000ICLRHK Speed [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:0792838424 Runaway Train]], and [[ASIN:079284047X The Train]].
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I love this
B004JN1D2I|3.0|At the time of this review, it costs $8.99 per book for the Kindle editions, which makes this bundle 3 cents more expensive than buying all four books individually.  Meanwhile, a bundle of 4 physical books is selling for just under $20.  Not to mention the fact that individual paperbacks are cheaper than $8.99.  I wasn't going to rate this, but apparently I have to in order to comment. After all, previous comments imply that this used to cost around $20. But don't buy this package if it costs more (or even the same) as buying all four books individually. And people should feel free to grumble about paying more for the digital version.  I don't know who contributes to the costs being higher, but it's wrong.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast moving, twists and turns and likable characters. Interesting story line. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did with all the hype, but I stayed up half the night to finish.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie as well as I enjoyed all the other Harry Potter movies, but instead of going over all the good points, which all the other 5 star reviews will tell you, I'll just focus on the negative.  You gotta be original somehow.<br /><br />What's up with all the icky green?  In this movie, nice happy blues, reds, oranges and yellows are not allowed.  Everything must be black, white, brown, gray, or this pale, slightly blue green that's just all over the place.  Check out the cover of the box: those are the only colors you'll see in this movie.  The only exception is in this scene involving the snake Nagini, which was very jarring.  Color palettes do not exist in real life.<br /><br />The movie does seem too long while watching it at home.  In the theater, it didn't seem to drag so much.  Normally, the second time watching a movie seems to go quicker.  This felt longer.  I'll probably have to fast forward the camping sequence next time I watch it.<br /><br />It's a little sloppy since there are a few things which are left unexplained, for instance the broken piece of glass which seems to be showing (spoiler deleted) in it.  I guess if I had the books memorized, I'd know what was going on there.  Maybe they'll explain it in part II, but I don't have my hopes up.<br /><br />Okay, those are my main nit-picks.  It's PG-13, with a not-exactly-kinda-sorta nude scene, so it's not for little kids.<br /><br />My single disc DVD has ONLY the 5 following deleted scenes:<br /><br />- The Dursley House: Harry and Aunt Petunia As They Leave House<br />- The Dursley House: Harry and Dudley Shake Hands<br />- Ministry of Magic Lifts: Harry Tells Arthur He's Being Tracked<br />- Tent: Trio Discusses Destroying The Locket<br />- Montage: Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones<br />And personally I'm glad these weren't in the theatrical version, as they would have slowed the movie down even further, and the Dudley handshake scene doesn't fit the emotional tone they're setting up.
1450400957|5.0|This is a very valuable resource for any bodybuilder or fitness minded individual. One of the authors Frederic Delavier is best known for his excellent illustrations in \\"Strength Training Anatomy\\" which depicted every muscle used during exercise. \\"The Strength Training Anatomy Workout\\" is a high quality addition to that first book. It shows the reader how to put the strength training principles into practice. What I really like about the workout edition is that the authors kept it pretty simple. You don't need tons of equipment to get in shape or perform the exercises described in this book. In fact, the authors even recommend  you do these exercises at home. You don't even need a gym unless that's where you prefer to workout. I love how detailed every exercise is explained and the step by step full color pictures. I also really appreciated the included complete workout routines that are tailored to different fitness levels. Overall, it is a very informative book that I can highly recommend. Even if you think you know it all about bodybuilding this book is still a good refresher on proper technique which is key to success in weightlifting.
0525422943|4.0|Gayle Foreman brings us the second book from here If I Stay series titled Where She Went. IIS was an amazing tearjerker of a read so I new somewhat of what to expect in WSW, but it took my breath away.<br />WSW takes us three years after Mia's accident and it is through the narrative of Adam. In Where She Went we what happens after Adam has asked Mia to Stay, and how that choice affects everyone around them.<br /><br />Times are tough after the amazing takeoff of Adam's band Shooting Star when the main release of the album Collateral Damage just after Mia had been in the accident. From the lyrics we see the pain and loss that Adam experienced at the top of each chapter then we find that find that stardome was not the answer for Adam and that the loss of Mia's leaving was the loss of his sanity in a way and his heart.<br /><br />WSW is an amazing tale of love, loss, regeneration, anger, abandonment, and hope. One you open it it takes you on the inner journey of our characters choices and what happened when Mia left, and where Adam went from there and where he will go on to now.<br />Get the tissues, there are some heartbreaking moments here and Gayle writes them so beautifully and smoothly that you cannot put it down.<br /><br />The one sentence on the back of the book sums up Where She Went quite well,<br />\\"Told from Adam's point of view in the spare, lyrical prose that defined If I Stay, Where She Went explores the devastation of grief, the promise of new hope, and the flame of rekindled romance.\\"

B000063TE5|5.0|One of the best albums of the 21st century. If you haven't heard it, I suggest you buy it soon.  You will not be dissatisfied.
1569242739|4.0|My friend Stacie turned me on to this one. I am a baker. I LOVE to bake. She's a vegan. She also loves to bake. I now have vegan cupcakes in my arsenal. <grin> Honestly, these are all really good. I've always hated foods that take out all sorts of things and bill themselves as 'just as good as the original.' It reminds me of a routine from a comedian talking about how a vegetarian friend offered her some dish or other saying \\"It tastes just like chicken!\\" She said she took a bite and said, \\"Wow! You have forgotten what chicken tastes like!\\" These actually live up to the hype, though. These are good cupcakes.
B002ZG976U|4.0|I rented this particular movie before purchasing it, and I did enjoy the amazing choreography, the music, and the costumes.  As for the plot?  You would do better to watch this movie on mute until the musical scenes are playing.  You'd be doing yourself a favor.  Still, I did end up purchasing it, and I gave it 4 stars because of the music, choreography, etc.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|This one was a great action film. The plot was interesting, too. A society of assassins with super-human abilities have a rogue agent. To defeat him, they recruit the son he abandoned as an infant. Jolie is amazing and amazing looking, as always as the assassin/mentor. McAvoy does a great job as the mild-mannered assassin's son who finds himself and his self-confidence as he trains. There are great action scenes and special effects, too. Again, not what you want to watch if you're looking for social commentary, but it's a heck of a ride!
B004GHNHVW|1.0|What a disappointment! I have no problem with an artist whom I admire and have followed for decades suddenly finding religion however a bit of forewarning to devoted fans who DO NOT share such predilections would have been nice. Now to support my arguement, Paul Simon has always been a spiritual man- in my opinion- however I never felt like his choices were being rammed down my throat, as this compilation does. The title track is the only \\"redeeming\\" tune on the whole album. I feel as though I've wasted 17 bucks. I reiterate, I'm happy Mr. Simon has found a balance within himself, I just think it would have been nice to alert those fans who have already found their own and might have saved some cash in these finacially stressed times. Currently the CD rests atop an milk bottle in my recycle bin.
B001E45XT4|4.0|The headphones are good for sound and people can hear me very well. They are alittle uncomfortable for me but each person has a differnet size head that is for sure. For the money a good buy at a great price.
0061703087|2.0|Yes, I read this book, and while reading it, I had to look at the cover several times to make sure it was actually Michael Crichton who wrote it.  Ok, his name's on the cover and he is given credit for writing it. But I have to really wonder.    I mean, this story was so bad and stupid, it was really way below his standards. While reading it I really kept saying to myself, \\"he must have  bought this story from someone and put his name on it\\" or something to that effect.     This story just came across as pure crap. Something I might expect from a 9th grader for a science fiction class.     One of the things I usually like about Michael Crichton's writing is the plausibility of what he talks about. Jurassic Park is a good example  of this. Yeah, I know its a stretch that somewhere out there is a team of scientists looking to clone dinosaurs, but the science is there to do   cloning. So that's what makes it plausible to believe.     But Prey was just stupid, corny garbage. Frankly, I\\"m surprised he was willing to put his own name on this.    Don't waste your time on this, its really bad writing and not a very interesting story.
B004GF244K|5.0|This was an amazing show! A tribute to one of the greatest musicians the world has ever known. All of George's friends and his son, got together to play his music and remember the man.  The blu-ray looks fantastic, and the soundtrack is amazing. A must see!!
B004UOCF3W|4.0|I have been pretty sour on the last several Foo Fighters albums.  I feel like they had gotten away from their strengths and tried to experiment, which is fine, but it didn't work.  The boys went back to what works with this album... straightforward, melodic, hard rock n' roll.  It best suits the band and Dave Grohl's voice as well.  I swear, it's almost like Dave Grohl sat down and read my Amazon reviews on their past 2 albums, and implemented my strategies for Foo Fighter success, LOL.<br /><br />I haven't enjoyed a Foo Fighters album this much since \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\", which is one of my favorite albums of all-time.  This album, while not as good, is without question the best Foo Fighters have done since then, and I'd certainly rank it their 2nd best album to date.<br /><br />My personal favorite from the album is \\"Dear Rosemary\\".  Dave Grohl does a cool little David Bowie thing with his voice in that song, that works, and works fantastic!<br /><br />All in all, great album, a Must Have for any fan of good, hard, rock music.  Oh, and also, a Big Thank You to Dave Grohl for not making the album dull, boring, slow songs!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This series--Castle--is one of the few shows I must watch.  I'ts well written and the casting is perfect.  It has everything:  drama, mystery, twists, comic relief/humor, romance, family dynamics, conflict, and even grammar lessons, which most people need badly.    I can't wait for the 3rd season to be available on DVD.
0061537934|5.0|Don't read what this book is about because you will think it sounds silly and not read it.  This was the best book I\\"ve read in 10+ years and I read about 300+ books a year.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is a riveting apocalyptic zombie thriller that seems endless and relentless.  There is a technique here of building up characters to create ominous suspense about their welfare.  Characters that you like and become attached to are not safe - especially when they feel safe.  This is a story that is brutally realistic in that horrific things happen to good people.  Addicting.
0316056863|5.0|This book is highly entertaining, funny and insightful. Aimed at women but I'm a guy and enjoyed it immensely. The audiobook version is even better since Tina is the reader. I've had several encounters with Tina and recently had my book signed at her B&N event in NYC. She was/is always a delight to see and talk to. HIGHLY recommended!
0061733199|4.0|This is an international favorite and a nicely compiled, well-written work. It is easy to read, authoritative, and appealing. I would place it next to the Boy Scout Fieldbook as a great teaching and learning resource. But see Olsen's \\"Outdoor Survival Skills\\" and the \\"USAF Survival Handbook\\".
0802473156|5.0|Great book, easy read.  My husband read it first; it really does make sense and gives insight to reasons that communication can break down.  I have also been able to apply what I have learned at work, after all, it's still language...  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to communicate better with any person :)
0060853972|2.0|I don't know how it's possible that I didn't love this book.<br /><br />The promotional blurbs on and inside the cover compare it to Douglas Adams and Monty Python, and I'm a great fan of absurdist British wit.  I've always been preoccupied with questions of ontology, theodicy, and ethics, and I have a decidedly irreverent sense of humor, so an offbeat novel about the Apocalypse should have been right up my alley.  And how could I NOT love a novel featuring a character named Anathema Device?<br /><br />I've read Neil Gaiman before, and I can't say he's one of my favorite authors.  \\"American Gods\\" was based around a truly original premise, and contained passages of sheer brilliance that I've never been able to forget - and yet it was a novel I can't really imagine wanting to read again.  \\"Coraline\\" left me cold, and although I loved the beginning of \\"The Graveyard Book,\\" I wasn't terribly thrilled about the ending.  I'd never read Terry Pratchett, but a friend of mine whose opinion I trust told me that, although he often has something wise to say, his delivery tends to be over-the-top.  I should have listened.<br /><br />There are some moments of absolute genius in \\"Good Omens.\\"  The quirky philosophy the authors explore is delightful, and similar to some of my own private reflections, though at times it ventures out of the realm of moral ambiguity and into the murky waters of moral nihilism.  There are some passages so unexpected and true that you'll want to grab the next available person and read them out loud: \\"God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players, to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who *smiles all the time*.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that a novel with so much going for it could prove disappointing, but I found myself slogging through the pages as much to get it over with as from any genuine interest.  There were enough witty and interesting moments to keep me from giving up altogether, and it was certainly a fast read.  However, the convoluted plot felt forced as often as it felt genuinely clever.  Perhaps, seeing as a major theme of the novel is the battle of good vs. evil as a sort of morally empty cosmic chess game, this feeling of contrivance was intentional, but if so, it didn't work for me.  It didn't help that the humor was so juvenile, absurdity for absurdity's sake (interspersed with moments of genuine wittiness): I have no doubt I would have laughed out loud at every page of this novel twenty years ago, but now it simply feels excessive and silly.<br /><br />Reading \\"Good Omens,\\" I kept thinking of \\"Galapagos,\\" by Kurt Vonnegut.  The two novels have a lot in common: a diverse cast of characters brought together by an unusual series of events, a truly omniscient narrator whose witty asides help move the plot along and hint at things to come, an irreverent sense of humor applied to events on a global scale.  \\"Galapagos\\" worked for me; \\"Good Omens\\" didn't.  If you're in the mood for some intelligent absurdity, I suggest you pick up \\"Galapagos\\" instead.ugh the pages as much to get it over with as from any genuine interest.

0802798225|5.0|[...]<br /><br />I absolutely loved Perfect Chemistry!  a touching story about a couple from completely different walks of life yet so similar in their daily struggles.<br /><br />Alex Fuentes is a bad boy, unwilling gang member from the wrong side of the tracks & Brittany Ellis is a picture perfect rich girl with everything, except a personal secret, she has a disabled sister she doesn't want anyone knowing about. Alex had his bad boy image down pat which made people fear him but Brittany who had also perfected a 'perfect' image saw beyond the act to delve into the 'real' Alex, who was actually quite compassionate & caring, especially with his family, friends & Brittany's sister.<br /><br />When thrown together in Chemistry class, Alex and Brittany were forced to work together to complete an assignment, during this time Brittany came to realise Alex was more than just a pretty faced, tattooed covered rebel, he was actually quite smart and  deep down wanted to make something of his life and to get out of the gang relations he was thrown into.<br /><br />Alex and Brittany balanced one another despite their different upbringings & the banter between them was witty and fun, seeing them both fight against their attraction and then fall for one another was really sweet but the suffering each had to endure was heartbreaking.<br /><br />Each chapter was written from each of their perspectives, it was great to get a glimpse of what each was thinking as well as what they were feeling and going though.<br /><br />I enjoyed the secondary characters, Paco was certainly a devoted best friend; It was heart wrenching what happened to him.<br /><br />The epilogue was wonderful, I am looking forward to reading about Carlos, Alex's brother in Rules of Attraction.<br /><br />I lovely engaging and fast read story of life lessons.

B000OCY7JE|5.0|After The Wedding is filmed, realized, created, and gifted to us from Susanne Bier (In a Better World). She is a master artist. The cinematography and editing are 7 stars on a scale of 5.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen (Casina Royale) gives us a show stopping, honest performance. He is tapped by countless international productions for his incredible skill and unique overall persona/image. He is an actor who carries his weight on screen. He is this man he portrays. His actions and movement on screen are incredible. He acts without words.<br /><br />Rolf Lassgård (Swedish Wallander Movies) blew me away with his portrayal of Jørgen Lennart Hannson, a Swede tycoon in Denmark. For me, I love the Swedish actor, speaking Swedish against one of its two sister languages Danish. It is something enjoyable to me for reasons I cannot explain here. This role was far from what I have seen him portray. He nailed it.<br /><br />Sidse Babett Knudsen also threw down in this work of art. Stine Fischer Christensen proved that she is a young actress worthy of her European acclaim. Stine steals our hearts and the later part of the film with a tear jerker scene.<br /><br />Susanne Bier is a master artist. I understand why Hollywood called on her for \\"Things We Lost in the Fire\\", a film which has her touch, on a smaller scale. I felt that Halle Berry was the weak link as an actor. Also Fire was missing something.<br /><br />I was not happy with a development later in the film. The development makes the story tick. Blame the writer.<br /><br />I felt that the overall artistic beauty, lovely direction, and top grade acting make this a no brainer as a 5 star work.<br /><br />After the Wedding deserved its nomination for best foreign film at the 2006 Academy Awards.
B000ICXQXI|1.0|I can't believe I wasted $2.99 to rent this movie on here. People are always raving to me about how awesome Psycho is, so I finally after years of hearing about it decided to watch it. And I have to say that this is a TERRIBLE movie. You say that this started the genre for Horror films? I say there's no way, maybe some of the 70's movies [and well 80's of course!] but this is in no way a 'Horror' movie. Its not scary, its not violent, its BLAH. I understand that its an old movie, and back then there was only so much you could do because of the technologically [and the fact Hitchcock didn't have much money to make this movie] but I think it could've been better then it was. I just have to say, for a movie that so many people rave about I'm pretty disappointed with it.
0440241901|5.0|Oh how I love thee book, let me count the ways. When Emma believes she's about to die while experiencing bad airplane turbulence, she nervously chatters her deep, dark secrets to a complete stranger only to find out later that he is her boss. Hilarity, ensues. The premise is a bit unbelievable but it is so worth the read.
0812550706|5.0|What I loved about this book is that the ending is a shocker. I was totally involved in the kids getting geared up for the final battle and before I knew it, BANG! Something happened! I won't spoil it for you. You certainly won't see that coming. The author really throws you for a loop.  I would say one of the best Sci-Fi books I've ever read. I'm starting Enders Shadow now!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I was looking for a way to get my music collection into my '07 G6 without spending an arm and a leg. I looked at switching out the stock head unit for a newer stock version, a third party head unit and add-ins that used the satellite radio in head units (which I didn't have) and I was looking at about $300 to do any of that. So I took a look back at FM transmitters. After a bad experience with a Belkin unit a few years ago I was a bit wary. After looking at the reviews for this Satechi Soundfly unit I took the plunge and boy was I surprised.    This thing rocks. I shunned hooking up my iPod and went with a 8GB SD card (no extra wires in the car) I had laying around doing nothing. Loaded it with my mp3's and I was away. I programed four stations into the presets but I've never had to change it once because of static or interference. I'm in the Chicago suburbs and this thing sounds like I'm playing a CD all the time. There is even a station (albeit not the strongest but it's there) on the frequency I'm using and this thing overpowers it's signal!    The LCD is great too as the RDS option doesn't really work with my stock head unit unless you leave and return to the frequency.    This is a bargain at $40.    The only work I had to do was make sure folders and files on the SD card were named how I wanted them.    Highly recommended.
B003KUSUG8|1.0|Recovery was by far the biggest piece of shiz album i've ever heard Marshall put out.  3 songs are killer, the rest are garbage.  \\"Talkin 2 myself, Cold Wind Blows, and No love,\\" the only good songs on the album make it a must NOT buy and a must download those 3 songs.  Eminem and Rihanna? Come on, bro, what is that nonsense?  On his last album he's talkin bout peeing on Rihanna and now he's makin a joint with her nasty self?  He needs to stay true to his roots- killing, drugs, emptiness, hate.    Psh, \\"Love the way you lie,\\" ARE YOU KIDDIN ME?!  Worst song ever! It's like he sold out; makes me lose a little respect for Em.
B004HGBUVG|5.0|Lucinda's Blessed is another excellent collection in a recent wave of terrific new releases - IMO, the best of the lot.  Is there anyone else out there writing and performing with the passion and perfection of Lucinda Williams? On Blessed, Lucinda is backed by a strong band anchored by Butch Norton on drums and David Sutton on a pound perfect bass. Rami Jaffee adds musical color and keys on organ, piano, and accordion. But this is a guitar lovers album and Greg Leisz and Val McCallum front a stellar string section featuring guests Elvis Costello (in full Attractions mode), Eric Liljestrand, and of course, Lucinda.  The opening tune, Buttercup, nearly blew out my car speakers once I hit repeat and cranked it. Copenhagen melted me with the autobiographical (for me) lines of being 57 and feeling 7 when you incomprehensibly lose someone you love.  Every song kills. Lucinda probably isn't for everyone, but this is enough to send me to the well to buy everything else I can by her.  Thanks Lucinda, and thank you Meg Griffin for turning me on to her, as you have with so many others.

B004P6EQE6|4.0|Obviously a great album, Mono or Stereo, this is a desert island pick with or without 'Mind Gardens'. The mono mix brings back memories of that unique sound, as did the Beatle mono reissues. Another fine example is Mitch Ryder's Smash Hits.     It really is a different sound.    Well, 44 years since I heard the mono mix, and other than the obvious qualities of mono & stereo, to me, nothing musically different jumps out. Some nice analog noise at the end of each track, almost waiting for the tone arm to lift.    And that is fine. Every Byrd maniac will get it & love it.  They know!    But could have they sprung for some info? The booklet is redundant to the 1996 issue, same intro, same annotations, except the 1996 had more artwork. A good portion of the kick of getting this stuff, is to absorb, reflect & relive the time when you just cracked the seal.    Some background on the discovery of the mono tapes and the subsequent work that went into the project (3 tracks on the 1996 reissue had to be remixed due to tape degradation) would have been welcome.    A fairly historical piece, given museum treatment sonically but nothing to read home about.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|This book was relatively highly recommended for me and it appeared on the decade's top 10 list for Sci-Fi / Fantasy novels.  It was, in a word, \\"okay.\\"  It was full of many instances of characters basically saying \\"look how clever I'm being with my plan,\\" and then carrying out said plan.  And, truth be told, many of the plans were hairbrained.

B004WMKSH2|5.0|I rented HARRY POTTER last night (Sunday, first weekend of availablity, so very heavy useage.) I watched the movie LATE, about 3am on the east coast, so I had none of the problems when overuse will lock up the signal. (I had the film streaming into my one year old laptop from a wifi hooked into a high speed phone line modem. From the laptop, I ran a hookup to a 32\\" LCD TV.) People worried about lockup of the picture during high demand times,  might try to download the film instead of streaming it, at a time when you KNOW the peak use is down. AS FOR THE DARK SCREEN, i encountered that the first time I rented a video on demand. I had bought INCEPTION from AMAZON, and got a free rental of the film. COOL! SO, i started the film, and my screen was mostly just...DARK. I could hear the opening music, but nearly no picture. I tried to fix it on the LCD TV, but that didnt help. THE FIX FOR A DARK SCREEN. IF you look at the top of your laptop/computer (I'm running windows 7) you will notice TOOLS. Click on, and you will notice COMPATABILITY VIEW on the list of options.  CLICK ON COMPATIBILITY VIEW. This lightened up the picture, to normal viewing. NOW, as for pixelation. I believe that's an artifact of the limits of transmission. When you have a \\"DARK\\" movie, it can be annoying, tho I only \\"noticed\\" the problem at first. Your eyes or brain will adjust. I dont have the option to rent videos, because my small city has NO VIDEO STORES, except for grocery store video kiosks. Let's be realistic. If you want HI DEF/ blu-ray reception, you cant get that via Video on demand. I dont think the servers, or the modems, or even maybe the computer processors, have the power...YET. This is new technology for the most part. WE ALL NEED TO GET USED TO WATCHING FILMS LIKE THIS, cos it IS the future. Just be patient with yourself, and AMAZON, until we all figure out how to get things to work. If you get a black/dark screen, and the FIX VIA \\"TOOLS\\" at the top of the page, for COMPATABILITY VIEW doesnt work, try to pull your BRIGHTNESS CONTROLL all the way to LIGHT. I think this works via the computer, and the TV as well. I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THE COMING ATTRACTION for the POTTER film, and get this bug ironed out then, if you expect a problem. If the COMING ATTRACTION doesnt look correct, and you dont want to chance it, or your have an older system with a slow processor, simply dont rent the film over the internet.<br /><br />Now, as for the HARRY POTTER FILM \\"DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 1.\\" I had no problem with the split. HEY, i lived thru LORD OF THE RINGS getting split in ways that drove me up a wall. BUT who is going to watch a 5 hour version of Deathly Hallows, and who wants to see the last book get over edited? The last book is too important. ALSO, \\"Harry Potter\\" isnt a kid anymore. The films have been dark, since the death at the tournement. I think that was the first REAL death. POTTER 7 has an ORWELL's 1984 vibe, with the way the ministry of Magic was taken over. That was forshadowed when Hogwarts was taken over. ALSO, the 10-12 year olds that liked the first movie/book, are older now. HARRY and company are literally warriors now. They can only expect a warrior's life. AND, we have seen this building for some time in the films. THIS IS A DARK FILM, and not just with the pallet of colors. Its about an orphan, its about evil taking over the world, its about oppression of Moggles (read: jews, blacks, the poor, etc). If your kid is 10 years old, NO WAY is this film for them. YOUNGER KIDS should be allowed to watch the first 3 films, UNTIL THEY GROW UP A BIT.  Unlike the LOTR, this is a very episodic series, that doesnt really depend on the previous book for the plot, UNTIL you reach films #3 or #4. IF this film were NOT dark, it would not have the depth of emotion. THIS IS HARRY POTTER AT WAR, troup movements, living in tents, visiting bombed out buildings and graves, its DARK STUFF for youngsters. HEY...rent MEGAMIND if you want \\"LIGHT\\"entertainment. WELL, lets get ready for JULY, and the LAST FILM, then we can put our elm wands away, and wait for the next BIG THING. (hopefully the Hobbit?)ady for JULY, and the LAST FILM, then we can put our elm wands away, and wait for the next BIG THING. (hopefully the Hobbit?)

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|After all of these years, our good friends the Foos are still doing it harder than ever. I bought this on the release date and I've been listening to it almost constantly since. There isn't a dull moment on the album. As musicians, these guys seem to keep maturing more and more, there's tons of funky chord progressions and whatnot (the technical side of music always interests me). Songs are written well, and I guarantee you will find at least one song that you can relate to.    All in all, whether you're new to the Foo Fighters or if you've been around since the beginning, this is one to get. Taylor's steady beats, Dave's strong vocals, smooth rhythm guitar work, and catchy anthem lyrics, Chris's warm leads, Nate's clear and definitive bass lines, and Pat's punk style guitar playing - it's all on this one, folks. Get it.

B0042RJWTM|5.0|I don't recall how many years I waited for this to become availiable on dvd. I wore 2 copies of VHS tapes down to colored blurs because I've seen it that many times. A bittersweet, searing tale of two men (with a resounding emphasis on \\"men\\") who struggle to keep their footing in a society that constantly shifts beneath and around them. Their lives, loves and losses are the substance of this last of the Golden Age of Westerns (although released in 1970). Lee Marvin, Jack Palance, Jeanne Moreau and Jim Davis were at the top of their game in this oater about a breed of men (with nice touches of period humor) who became history and taught moral lessons by their actions.   The touching relationship of Marvin's Monte Walsh with Jeanne Moreau's \\"Countess\\" will bring tears to your eyes. In my humble opinion, a great film in a forgotten genre.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I love my other Logitech gaming peripherals (G500 mouse, G15 keyboard) so when I wanted a dedicated game controller I naturally went to Logitech.<br /><br />Pros:<br />ergonomically it's great. The keys feel good, the wrist angle feels comfortable, the thumb joy stick is just where you want it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I could not get the software key mappings to function correctly. I downloaded the latest/greatest drivers from Logitech to see if that was the issue. No love. I tried to find an answer on tech support forums. Nothing. The issue is this, I play Rift. When I map a key to the letter \\"6\\" for example in the game (an offensive spell) instead it maps \\"r, 6\\". So instead of hitting a mob, I'm replying to a tell and annoyingly all my further keystrokes are just additional comments in the tell. I tried three times with a new empty profile. I could never get the keymapping to correspond to the single key I typed. I checked the software and for many keys it apparently randomly added additional key strokes that I could not edit/remove. When I checked the WoW default profile it also had multiple key strokes, out of the box.<br /><br />The documentation is non-existent. The \\"tutorial\\" is a Flash animation that looks cool but provides no content - no real information on how to use the item. No user's manual that I could find.<br /><br />For a little less than $70 I expect an item to work as designed, out of the box. I could cope if there was a small bug fix or gotcha that was documented that I had to tweak. A guild member suggested I revert to version 6.x drivers as the 7.x drivers have bad reviews from gamers. I am reluctant to keep hardware that doesn't have current, debugged software drivers. Even if I get this to work on old drivers, what happens with my next OS service patch?<br /><br />This is more work and less fun. Back it goes.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|I pre-ordered this item and got it a day before the actual release date! It was in perfect condition, still wrapped in the plastic. A great family movie, hardly a foul word is spoken and a good message of fatherly love. The BEST part of the movie is the MUSIC! A great sci-fi movie with incredible visual effects.

After 15 minutes I realized I should have not forgotten to bring my sanity keeper. I remembered my Droid came with this ap pre-installed and opened it up. I was able to access my account, look up the book I was reading, download said book and start reading where I left off in less than five minutes. Without this ap, my two hour sit in the waiting room would have started with an H ended in a double L with a big E in the middle.
0316056863|3.0|I'm a big fan of Tina Fey and 30 Rock, so when I first heard about this book, I checked it out immediately.  From Amazon's preview pages alone, I was convinced that this would be a fun, light read, which it is.  Unfortunately, it's a little too light, as there isn't a lot of depth to the topics that Fey covers.  She never gets too detailed when it comes to current personal matters, which is understandable; she's never struck me as the type of celebrity to talk about her personal life at length, so the fact that we get anything in that regard is fine.<br /><br />But she also glosses over the behind-the-scenes stuff related to 30 Rock and SNL, and her film work is ommitted entirely save for a couple of passing references to Mean Girls.  That these topics aren't covered in more depth in favor of an entire chapter on what it's like to be in a magazine photoshoot is pretty disappointing.  Although to be fair, she does devote a good deal of time to the Sarah Palin situation.<br /><br />But where the book really shines is in Fey's dissection of the rampant sexism found in the male-dominated field of comedy, both past and present.  She tackles the topic with a humor and eloquence I haven't seen or heard anywhere else, and it's these bits scattered throughout the book that really make it worth reading.<br /><br />In the end, the book's shortcomings basically balance out with its strong points, leaving it just a decent book.  It's difficult to even justify calling it 288 pages long, as the margins and line spacing are larger than I've seen in most books and it also includes several pictures and entire script excerpts from 30 Rock and SNL.  I'd say it's realistically about half the advertised length, though it's a totally breezy read.  I managed to finish it in one weekend, and I'm generally a pretty slow reader.  It's easy to pickup and difficult to put down, though it's a book I could really only recommend for hardcore Tina Fey fans.
140131046X|5.0|\\"Have a Little Faith\\", by Mitch Albom, is basically two different stories about three men, two religious leaders from different faiths; Albom's childhood Rabbi (Reb), Henry a Christian Pastor from the inner city of Detroit and the author Mitch Albom.  The story places Albom into two different religions, two different cultures and the worlds of those who have and those who have not. It is the tale of his encounters with these men and his skepticism of all religions.<br />  The story starts with Mitch Albom's childhood Rabbi asking him the favor of writing and delivering his eulogy when he passes after service one day.  He is caught off guard by rabbi's request because he no longer lives in the area and is not a regular participant at services.  Finally he agrees to the request with the condition that he gets to know him better as a man.  Reb agrees to his condition and this makes Mitch a bit uncomfortable because he know it will put him  back into his synagogue and faith he left behind years ago.<br />  He begins his weekly trips back and forth from Detroit to visit the Reb, with many health scares over the years and learns the life story of Reb and the strength of his faith thru many of life's trials.  He nick names him the `singing rabbi' because of his love for song.  Mitch begins to develop a relationship with Reb that becomes unexpected to him and it opens his eyes to his upbringing and the faith he never understand.<br />  Closer to home in Detroit, Albom is looking for an organization to support and encounters Henry a Christian Pastor, a reformed drug dealer and convict.  Henry, the leader for \\"I Am My Brother's Keeper Ministries\\" preaches to the poor, cares for the homeless, criminals, addicts and anyone who needs him, for free because his church comes first.  With any religion Albom is skeptic, but he is very skeptical about Henry's motives and his faith.  After several meetings Albom finally decides to visit Henry's church without telling him and he discovers that even with a hole in the decaying church's roof Henry stays positive and faithful that God with take care of it when the time is right.  Obstacles will not stop him for caring for the needy and doing the job he promised God he would do in His name.<br />  As he goes between the worlds of these two men he knows how different each is yet he sees how similar they are in their survival, faith and trust in God.  Reb embraces his retirement, health issues and his own death as it approaches and Pastor Henry trusts that his mission for the needy will be met and his church will remain open.  He doesn't understand it and is suspicious at times but as the years go on he sees how their faith transforms their lives.<br />  The ending is exactly what is expected, Mitch Albom giving Reb's eulogy, but what isn't expected is how the lives of these two different men change how Mitch Albom sees his own upbringing, his faith and the trust people place in God.  It transformed him and fulfilled a part of his life that was empty.<br />  This is an easy read book and not a religious book by any means.  It is the true, honest story of Mitch Albom's journey of regaining his faith and losing his cynical outlook on religion.  It is the touching story of an ex-convict who changed his ways to help others and the story of a rabbi who enjoyed his life to the fullest to the very end.  It is a book of experiences.<br />  Mitch Albom did a wonderful job with this story and I highly recommend it.  Once you start reading you won't put it down and it will make you think once you begin to close the cover on the final page.discovers that even with a hole in the decaying church's roof Henry stays positive and faithful that God with take care of it when the time is right.

B004NDVJJG|5.0|\\"Faithful\\", the newest release from Wasilewski and friends, continue rather mellow and nostalgic house-sound of the Trio started with \\"January\\". Well recorded material that fits perfectly into those long, and cold winter nights spent next to the fireplace. The pace of the album points to the slower side with couple exception like \\"Big Foot\\" where for several moments we have dynamic bass and drum dialog introduced by Miskiewicz and Kurkiewicz duo. The material given on this album reminds me of Tord Gustavsen's approach where the melancholy and nostalgia are constantly present in the air.<br />I am looking forward to see them again live in NY or PA area soon!

The whole first half of \\"Jacob's POV\\" I basically had to skim through... it was so boring, dialouge after dialouge but no real answers... blah

B000YIGNKE|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie. I found the storyline hard to follow, and often the dialog was spoken so fast that I could not decipher what the actors were saying. And, I know it's a side issue, but I was really put off by the hairdo of the heroine. She never seemed really appealing enough to draw the hero's attention. I wanted to like this movie, but I just could not get there.

B0034G4ORC|1.0|A terrible movie and a complete waste of time, unless you are a big fan of computer games such as Call of Duty World at War and Black Ops. It is an almost uninterrupted orgy of noise and screams. After ten minutes I was totally exhausted. The characters are completely one-dimensional. Macho men running and shooting at everything that moves. They communicate by cliche oneliners. The storyline is as flat as the heartbeat of a recently deceased person. After fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored, numbed and fed up by it all that I \\"switched off\\", crept behind my newspaper and left it to my son and his friends to complete the viewing. From behind the newspaper I patiently endured the endless string of gunshots, explosions and shouted commands. Do not be fooled: there's hardly any science in this fiction, it's just a \\"one-in-a-dozen\\" war movie. I cherished the silence as almost never before when at last the TV set was switched off. I couldn't have cared less if the aliens had won.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Cute movie but a little too much hype. It wasn't THAT good. My kids aren't really into the whole Cars thing.
0670022411|5.0|I read A Discovery of Witches with increasing delight. If you enjoy paranormal mysteries, this is a great one. If you enjoy historical fiction, this is a great one. I love the scholarly tidbits and knowledge of the past that the author knows and relates with apparent ease.  I didn't do anything but read for several days to continue the story; to learn what happens next. I didn't want to stop until I finished. It was hard to take breaks for food and sleep.     Towards the end, I often find series novels to lose the Wow factor. This end of this book felt similar to that, but I still loved it. I can't wait until the next novel, which promises some time traveling. More history!    Daemons and vampires and witches. I like the addition of witches to the common vampire/fairy mix. The daemons here sound more like fairies than what I think of as demons. They are the creative geniuses/tortured souls of this world. The witches in the protagonist's family are wonderful, but there also witches willing to do bad, bad things to her if she doesn't give them what they want. Everyone is after her - Diana Bishop. A war may be starting...    Enough. Enjoy!

0525951652|5.0|Don't let the low star rating fool you.  It is that way because of a bunch of disgruntled kindle readers who don't like the kindle price.  I solved that problem by buying an e-reader that accepts downloading of books from the public library which is how I read this one. Between that device and my kindle I seldom pay for books.    This book is entertaining, my only regret it that I had to come to the end of it. I am very much looking forward to reading part two coming out in 2012.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Just skip it! I agree with many other reviewers--flat characters, unfinished plots, the villians are hardly even in the book, too much about nothing. My biggest pet peeve--they were \\"married\\" and never had intercourse! Really? They are soul mates on Earth to fulfill a great prophesy and yet, the can not make love. Crazy. The book was boring, total waste of my time.
B004QDCYJC|5.0|Ludicrous, overblown, pompous and powerful are all adjectives that can be applied to successful power metal if it's done well and here Symfonia tick all the boxes with a release that is as colourful, melodic and frenetic as you would expect from members of Stratovarius, Angra, Helloween and Sonata Arctica but there's one word yet missing from the list, and that word is FUN. Like the finale of a particularly catchy musical number, the canvas that Symfonia work from is huge and every song explodes like so many coloured glitter bombs whilst the music is both powerful and distressingly catchy, sticking in your mind whether you want it to or not proving that the gaudily coloured and stylised artwork is the perfect representation of the content of `In Paradisium'.     Eschewing anything as subtle as an introduction, Symfonia rock from the very first moment of the album when guitarist Timo Tolkki unleashes a riff that is pure old school metal backed by Uli Kusch's fast-paced drums and Mikko Harkin's almost Baroque keyboard attack. While musically invigorating, however, `Fields of Avalon' belongs to singer Andre Matos (of Angra fame) who tests his vocal range to the very limit with a brave, impassioned and brilliant performance that will delight fans of his own band and of heavy power metal in general. It's all completely bonkers of course, with the band unable to resist massed vocals on the chorus and a hook line so brazenly catchy it could have been pulled from some Broadway-hugging musical. Yet what keeps you hooked is that all important sense of fun. Like Warmen or Sonata Arctica at their best you can feel through every steroid-enhanced riff and earthquake-causing beat that the band are having the time of their lives blasting the song out and its impossible not to get swept up in it no matter how hard you may try to resist. Second track `come by the hills' has a similar, epic feel with hints of both Iron Maiden and Nightwish bursting through the opening riff and Andre'sBruce Dickinson-esque vocals. It's less overtly theatrical than its forebear although the chorus is once again more addictive than crack. Getting progressively heavier as things move on, `Santiago' is an absolute belter with a huge central guitar riff and another stunning performance from Andre who is capable of multiple styles from gritty hard rock to soaring high notes, often in the same song and who proves to be the perfect front man for this ambitious, energetic band. Certainly `Santiago' has bags of style and the stunning guitar/keyboard break at its core allows both Timo and Mikko to show off their dexterity while bassist Jari Kainulainen more than keeps up in the dash to the finale.     Shifting pace, the initial thought at the start of `Alayna' is that the band have covered a Duran Duran song, before the delicately picked guitar shifts the focus more in the direction of Sonata Arctica's `San Sebastian', which is no bad place to be at all. Emotive and giving Andre a chance to shine without the band's usual `kitchen-sink' approach in the background, it's a gorgeous power ballad that would, if there was any justice in the world, scale the charts destroying hip-hop and so called R&B numbers by the score before arriving proudly at the number one spot. That outcome, alas, seems a touch unlikely so we'll settle just for knowing that it's a great track. Seemingly having had enough down time, the band come scorching back in with the brutal `forevermore', the opening riff of which actually recalls System of a down's `BYOBB' before things take a more obvious power metal direction with the introduction of the vocals. Equally victorious is the chugging, folk-metal stylings of `Pilgrim road' which sees Timo shine brightly once again with a stunning and fluid guitar solo that stands out as this particular song's finest moment. Opting for a darker, more operatic metal feel the title track sees massed choral vocals and synth strings vying for space against a mid-tempo riffbefore everything falls away to reveal Andre's naked voice and a gentle acoustic guitar to great effect highlighting the fact that Symfonia don't always follow a predictable route preferring to keep the listener guessing what is going to come next rather than pandering to expectations. Hence when the song moves back through its opening riff and then charges off on an Iron Maiden gallop you perhaps shouldn't be too surprised and the track is another highlight that rocks and delights in equal measure with Andre turning in a performance that recalls Geoff Tate at his peak.     The final part of the album kicks off with the riff-heavy `Rhapsody in black' which is pure old school metal with a hint of `Empire'-era Queensryche amidst its driving riffs and vaguely pop-styled verses. `I walk in neon', meanwhile, is aptly titled with the band turning in a blistering performance that begins with a simple keyboard riff and then turns into the sort of chugging riff guaranteed to get the denim and leather-clad hordes into a froth while the chorus is huge beyond belief. The final track, `don't let me go' sees the band in a reflective mood with a cello added to the mix and a gentle acoustic strum opening a track that will undoubtedly prove to be a sing-a-long par excellence in the live environment with Andre stating \\"don't let me go, I'm here to stay, enjoy the moment, live day by day\\" which could well be the band's official motto such is the vibrancy of their output.     Overall you probably have some idea if this is for you or not. I know many metal fans who run a mile at power metal and many more who embrace it wholeheartedly suggesting that it is one of the many `marmite' sub genres of metal. However, if you do like strong, driving, melodic and passionate metal then you'll go a bundle on this colourful and interesting release. To be sure there are times when the over-the-top approach gets a bit much and you yearn for a simple, sledgehammer riff to churn through the various elements but overall this is a great example of talented musicians playing the music they love and it's almost impossible to not get a kick out of such dedicated artistry. To sum up, then, `In Paradisum' is a vital, vibrant, fun album that will thrill power metal fans and classic rock fans alike.
0500543933|5.0|Anyone who's tried street photography will know that its probably the hardest photographic genre to do well. Thousands of pictures may result in only one or two keepers. This excellent book is full of wonderful examples of photos that work well. An inspiration!
0684800713|3.0|The book is considered great--a description of the lost generation after World War I, and an exemplar of Hemingway's unusual, laconic prose, what Malcom Cowley called \\"The Middle American Prose Style.\\" I've read the book a number of times over the years, and never quite enjoy it. The characters seem juvenile, all of one type, all variations of Hemingway's antiquated notion of manhood. The female protagonist, Lady Brett, is just a male fantasy, the femme fatale no man can have, who is unhappy and unfullfilled herself. These vamps seem to populate the literature of the twenties--modeled on famous bohemian heiresses or actresses of the day. Jake, the main character, is another Hemingway self-description, alienated and in pain, with little wit or cleverness in self-reflection.  With uninteresting characters, a somewhat primitive ethos of manhood, prose style that may have been novel in its inception in the twenties but flat upon reading now, and not much in the way of unusual narrative, I am puzzled this book retains its high acclaim. One wonder if it is simply because, with its short words, it is easy to read. And oddly, nevertheless I continue to read and re-read it every once in a while--mostly because of the unwaveringly dry prose--the same kind of stoic beauty as a midwestern plain.

B003XU75QG|5.0|The Pretty Reckless's debut CD is amazing! Interviews with Taylor and the band say that they worked very hard to create a good album and they succeeded. Every track is good and I never want to skip a track. I have been listening to it almost non-stop since the album came out and I don't see ever getting sick of it, though I am eager to hear new music from them. It's only going to get better from here! The Pretty Reckless is here to stay!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Many of the reviews have talked about this movie as a throw-back to the 50s and 60s, Hitchcock, Cary Grant, Grace Kelly kind of film.  I can see that.  Depp is Frank, a Wisconsin school teacher on holiday, who meets Elise, played by Angelina Jolie on a train headed to Venice.  As a result, he ends up in one of the glamour hotels of Venice, then shot at, incarcerated, tied up, and then rescued in a boat chase.    One of the best action scenes in the movie involves Depp in his pajamas running across the terra cotta roof tiles of Venice.  Then this is followed by one of the funniest scenes in which attempted murder gets placed in its appropriate place between murder and room service.    Jolie is beautiful and compelling, even if her character is a little under-written.  Venice is almost a character in the movie, and if you want eye candy, this movie certainly has it.    But perhaps the best part is that if you enjoyed the Usual Suspects, you will really appreciate how well this movie works the second time you see it.
0240815807|5.0|I recently finished reading this book, and found it to be thorough, well organized, and full of great tips.     Mike takes a logical approach, starting with getting your workspace in order, through getting your tracks cleaned up and organized, into a simple method for setting balances and eq'ing for maximum clarity, then getting into the art of making the song shine.    The section and method he suggests for referencing commercial mixes is worth the price of the book. Nothing will teach you faster than good referencing, though it can be hugely discouraging when you think your mix sounds great - until you put it up against a few commercial tracks! That's the only way to get to that level of mix quality, though!    This isn't a 'quick-fix, get your mix done in an hour' method, but it's how professional mixers get the quality you hear on those releases.     Mike has done home recordists and professionals alike a great service with this book. Buy it. Buy it now.
1401216676|4.0|The illustrations are great, but this is a very short book for the money. Even stopping to take in the graphics, this was over in about an hour. Having only read Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, I was expecting something that would keep me busy for a while. My own fault for not looking at the number of pages, but something you should be aware of when you order.    It doesn't contain a great deal of storyline. Yes, you find out where the joker came from, but it's pretty straight forward and only really interesting for big fans. If you're new to the genre, as I am, I would start with something much more interesting (and MUCH better value), like the two I mentioned above.    Am giving it 4 stars for the art work, and the fact that I know I'll read it again sometime because it's so easy to get through in one sitting.
0439023491|4.0|After the first AMAZING book, you would expect from the author much more. The first half of Catching Fire is slow and a little boring, and it takes a long time to get to the serious part. It seemed to me like Collins was having some difficulties continuing the plot.<br />But the worse part, in my opinnion, was Katniss loses her mind. Of course, after all she had been through in the first book, it is not so surprising, but yet it is much harder to understand her character and identify with her. Most of the time I simply tried to figure out what she was thinking to herself, and it was very frustrating.<br />I give this book 4 stars mostly because Hunger Games was one of the best book I have ever read and also because Catching Fire wasn't so bad, just very disappointing. I recommend reading Catching Fire, but warn - don't expect a lot. The third book though, I started reading and stopped in the middle (something I almost never do) because I couldn't stand Katniss's insanity anymore.<br />*I'm sorry if I have English mistakes, I'm not an English speaker.
0385737955|4.0|After reading reviews, you've by now learned what this story is about. As with most of my reviews, I am just going to state what I liked and didn't like.     I loved the pretense for this story. It sounded like [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] in a sense, and I, like most others, found this while searching in the Hunger Games forum for what to read next. After all, as far as kids-trapped-in-an-arena type books go, nothing tops the Hunger Games. I was very excited to see what would happen to kids trapped in a maze.    I felt like I didn't know the characters. We just picked up on the character's lives up to this point and went from there. The only one that I felt had any depth was Chuck as he was the most emotional. I really didn't care about Thomas. Although he was the main character, the other characters, like Newt, Minho and Chuck, were almost as present as Thomas was. I do understand they all lost their memories, but some of them went through The Change but no one would talk about it. It would have been nice for someone to say something that they saw or remembered, at least to give the story a bit more suspense and the reader a bit more knowledge.     No one would talk about WICKED, the beetle blades, the Grievers or any other negative thing. I really would have like to see some development on that. I also wish we would have learned a bit more about Teresa, and that Thomas would have listened to her when she tried to tell him what she knew as she was coming out of her coma. It seemed like Thomas didn't want to know anything at all by the middle of the story.     I did love the concept of the story. I do admit, it was predictable, at least for me. I suspected the twists and turns within the first few chapters, but that didn't ruin it for me. It was still a very enjoyable book. It did keep me up until 6:30am and had a lot of suspense. I really liked the ending and am very excited to read [[ASIN:0385738757 The Scorch Trials (Maze Runner Trilogy, Book 2)]] and then [[ASIN:0385738773 The Death Cure (Maze Runner Trilogy)]] when it's released. I'd say this is worth reading. Although the characters don't have much depth and the story could have been developed a lot more, I give it four stars for originality and keeping me entertained.
0316056863|4.0|I'm a Tina Fey fan. If you're not, there's probably very little chance that you'll like this book, but then you're also probably not reading this review. I enjoyed Bossypants, although it surprised me because 1) it's not really an autobiography, which is what I was expecting, and 2) while it's entertaining throughout, there are very few genuine laugh out loud moments. It reads more like a series of short essays about parts of Tina's life, spliced with essays about her views on subjects like body image, breastfeeding, photoshopping and raising a daughter. Some of these diversions are thoughtful and terrific, others are pretty ho hum and just read like padding.<br /><br />The early segments about her upbringing are enjoyable, but I was especially interested in Tina's stories about moving into comedy and starting up 30 Rock. She's extremely self-deprecating about her own talent, barely mentions Mean Girls and only has one passing aside to the awards that 30 Rock has won. What she does talk about it the male dominated world that is comedy (\\"only in comedy, by the way, does an obedient white girl from the suburbs count as diversity\\") and the challenges of balancing work with her personal life (\\"my reverie of quitting my job is inevitably interrupted by someone who needs me to get back to work\\"). She also avoids getting into any territory that's too personal.<br /><br />Some of my favorite chapters were the ones dealing with her personal relationships. A moving salute to her father - always referred to as \\"Don Fey\\". The hilarious cruise vacation that goes horribly wrong that was her honeymoon. Her guilt about having a nanny and her indecision about whether to have another child, knowing that it could mean an end to 30 Rock and unemployment for her 200 colleagues.<br /><br />In short: an uneven read, but one that Tina Fey fans will undoubtedly enjoy.
0316069353|4.0|Very engaging book.  I could not put it down.  All the characters are well developed and come across real and flawed.  I could not put this book down.  A typically good Connelly book.  Can't wait for The Drop!
B004PVF95Q|2.0|I can't find much that's good to say about this release.  The songs seem stuck in repetitive loops, with only minimal variations on themes.  \\"The Birds\\" has its moments but it takes too long to get there.  \\"The Night Will Always Win\\" is the lowlite for me -- a depressing, overdramatic song with an insipid melody and almost no development.     I believe Elbow is a brilliant band and for that I've raised my rating to two stars.  Their prior release, The Seldom Seen Kid, is filled with a wide variety of dramatic delicacies with inspired performances and brilliant production.  I wish I could say the same for this one.  Be prepared for disappointment.
B00005JMK0|5.0|There is not much I am going to write in this review.  I've been reading everybody else's reviews and they are ALL exactly what I want to say.<br /><br />With that said, \\"HEY MGM !!!! AREN'T YA LISTENING?!?!?!\\"  Bring ELECTRIC DREAMS to DVD/Blu-Ray NOW !!!!  What are you waiting for??????
B001EO2UJK|4.0|I've read through most of the reviews of this box set, and I have to say there's some meat to the complaints that things sound different. There's a brashness, and harshness that can be heard when the levels go up too high, but even on a nice pair of headphones (Koss Sportapro headphones, in case you were wondering), there's a sense of headroom and spaciousness that the Definitive Edition Remasters  (DER) was sorely lacking. Trespass DER sounded flat and lifeless, but the stereo remix is alive, and vibrant. The further I moved up the catalog (Foxtrot, Selling England by the Pound) the differences were a little less stark, and quibbly, but overall I've found that the stereo remixes are my personal preference. They don't sound overly compressed, and my brief fiddling with Audacity noticed some overloaded sections, but nothing that screamed distortion. I think the engineers walked a fine line between making the best recordings they could and making a disaster. For some, I'm sure they see this as anathema, but I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Also, the 5.1 mixes sound absolutely remarkable, even compared with the stereo mixes.    If you have the chance, please sit and listen to these remixes. Do an A-B comparison if you can. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the results of this box-set. Make your own choice. I was scared for quite some time over picking this up, but decided to pick this up regardless, and I'm glad I did. This was lovingly crafted re-recording, and the best I've heard these albums to date.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|When Fringe first debuted I watched the first episode and was not that impressed.  A few years later I stopped watching TV and turned to Netflix.  I decided to give it another try and watched the first season.  I was totally hooked.  It is the best TV show ever as far as I am concerned and I loved Lost (until the end), Battlestar Gallactica, Prison Break and Dexter.  To me what makes Fringe so enjoyable is the way they play with the graphics and create the world the characters live in.  In the episode from the 80's they changed the opening credits to look like credits from the 80's and when they went to the other side, the Fringe opening credits were different enough to make you curious.  That is so clever and I have never seen anything like that.  I love the science it is understandable and fascinating.  I love Peter, I know a lot of people don't like him because of Dawson's Creek, but I never saw Dawson's Creek and I think he and Walter are the most interesting characters on the show.  I also love Olivia she is a hell of an actress, her face is so expressive and I am a big fan of Charlie Francis.  I am glad they brought him back.  I am about to purchase some individual episodes because I can no longer wait for Netflix.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I had this movie on my instant queue to watch on Netflix for weeks before I decided to watch it. I don't know much about Bollywood movies and I had no clue who Shahrukh or Kajol were before the film but by the end of My name is Khan I was hooked. The magic and the chemistry between these two actors are incredible making every scene they are in captivating. Shahrukh is so convincing in his portrayal of a person with Asperger Syndrome that I actually thought he had the condition. Like many other reviews, I thought the mamma Jennie's storyline could have been shorter but certainly did not take away from this beautiful film. This movie is a must see for the entire family, simply superb.    I was so impressed by Shahrukh that I have purchased the other 5 films with him and Kajol and also have been on a Bollywood binge...I simply can't get enough!!!!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I love the high energy of her latest album. The beats and lyrics are so catchy, and the album is cohesive. I like that the album has a different sound from her others. It is definitely more of a dance album. Great for Britney fans or for anyone looking for a good upbeat, dance album.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|This film is slow, tedious and ultimately very predictable. Angelina Jolie's part could have been<br />done by a manikin, it was that stiff. Johnny Depp just mugged his way through the film and tried<br />(and failed) to look scared in the chase scenes. Beautiful scenery was the only positive thing<br />to say about a very bad movie. I generally watch movies to be entertained, this was not even<br />entertaining.
0439023521|5.0|This is a book that will stick with you.  I almost find it hard to believe it is a young adult book.  I would be hesitant to even allow my 13 year old to read it without offering a little guidance.  I recommend this book to anyone asking.
B002JIEYL2|4.0|This is not one of Black Sabbath's best known albums. Their first three have that distinction. The only song from this album that became a bonafide hit was the title track, which became a classic rock staple. The whole album is fantastic though. Here they refine their sound and add synth, orchestral and keyboard textures. Even the novelty track \\"Fluff\\", which is a fan-hated softer side of the metal legends is a well-executed and composed song. Maturity is the word used by most critics reviewing this album. Although their earlier stuff had a bit more instant appeal, this album doesn't take long to get used to and after it takes hold it doesn't let go.     Lyrically, it is less gothic than earlier albums, with Sabbath concentrating on modern (for the time) themes more. Sabbra Cadabra, which is a paean to pagan witches, comes off as one of the strangest love songs ever written. Musically, the synths, pianos, flutes and other accents enhance Sabbath's style. Any fan of heavy metal, classic rock or dreary music will love this incarnation of the masters of the \\"doom blues\\". I bought the Japanese edition and compared it to the Sanctuary Deluxe remasters and I think that this has a clearer, more defined sound. The Sanctuary editions are excellent but tend to try to squeeze more volume out of the remaster by sacrificing dynamic range and it results in slight distortion at higher volume.     The only true classic Sabbath tunes on this album are:  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  Sabbra Cadabra  Killing Yourself to Live    My favorite Sabbath albums in order from best to worst are:    PARANOID  BLACK SABBATH  MASTER OF REALITY  SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH  Vol.4  HEAVEN AND HELL  THE MOB RULES    PARANOID through MASTER all get 5 stars, with the others getting 4. All strongly recommended.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorite stories.  The wisdom and love of the main character are refreshing and inspiring. There are lovely nuggets of stunning insight found right along side expressions of clear, spot-on judgments. \\"Racing\\" left me aching for an Enzo of my own.
1439102724|4.0|I haven't finished reading this yet (nearly there though) but I'd thought I'd give my opinions on it so far.     I'm finding the characters unlikeable-especially Zoe. I actually can't stand her-why is it that the author creates so many unlikable female characters. Another female character I hated was the mother in My Sister's Keeper. I just find it very hard to sympathise with these characters. I haven't taken a side yet.     **spoilers ahead.**    **Don't say I didn't warn you.**    Zoe and Vanessa-they don't have any right to take somebody else's embryos and plant them into somebody else-Vanessa. The embryos don't belong to them anymore. Zoe and Max are divorced and they belong to Max.     Max-why is he giving them to his brother and his wife? Why can't they find other ways to have children? Like adopting for example. This is what Vanessa and Zoe should try also. Max may want to keep the embryos himself one day. Even though he doesn't want to have another baby, he could change his mind.     So many unlikable characters.

B004SBX112|3.0|2 days after the Easter update came out on the official Market, the update for the PAID version finally hit Amazon. I believe Rovio is the cause of this delay instead of Amazon, since us $1 payers are less of a cash cow than constant ad users. We are less important :/    This Easter update is sorta disappointing. While the gameplay is still as fun as always, the game FREEZES randomly for 2 seconds quite often, instead of the smooth and fluid Angry Birds we love.    It baffles me since this update doesn't seem to have anything new or groundbreaking. Hope future releases will be less problematic.    - myTouch 4G

B004BLJQOK|4.0|Let Me in is not as much a horror movie as a creepy drama. It is a very good retelling of the novel and the foreign film that came before it. I usually love these types of creepy flicks. (I'm not big on gore for gore's sakes)However, I found myself bored at times and that came from the general story. The overall acting was fantastic. Especially the kids. This is a good movie for those who like their horror more psychological. It is definitely not for fans of slashers or the saw movies for that matter.
031237593X|3.0|Sharon Penman tells a great yarn.  She also puts in the hours of research necessary to give historical narrative an authentic ring.  However, with The Sunne In Splendour the author takes a possibility and tries to stretch it into a probability, which just isn't happening.  I have no doubt that the Tudor propaganda mill had a good time grinding Diccon into dust.  However just as someone may be out to get a paranoid person, the vilified may indeed be villainous.<br /><br />Penman fingers the Duke of Buckingham for the crime of murdering the little princes. Hilariously, while decrying the vilification of Richard, she has no trouble smearing Buckingham with a broad brush.  Of course there is absolutely no extant evidence to support her claim, but so what?  It makes for a good read.  The problem  for Penman is of the three suspects (Henry Tudor, Richard and Buckingham) it is only Richard who has motive, means AND opportunity.<br /><br />Furthermore, to Richard's 15th Century mind, there is a \\"justice\\" in disposing of the little princes.  The Rivers-Grey family are upstarts crowding out the old nobility.  For a Plantagenat to have to endure a Rivers' being elevated to his equal stature would be an affront.  To see a low-birth family who had supported the Lancasters until Elizabeth caught Edward's eye would be insufferable.  And once the rumors start flying Edward had been betrothed before (and therefore his issue with Elizabeth illegitimate) well, NOBODY in the world had more incentive to kill those kids-- family pride or personal position was alone reason enough.  The two together was just irresistible.<br /><br />Of Buckingham, Henry Tudor or Richard, all three would definitely have like to see the boys dead.  All three could easily pay assassins to do their dirty work.  Richard, however, as Lord Protector is the only one with total access to the Tower of London.  Remembering the Tower of London isn't just a Tower, but the 15th century's version of a maximum security prison, this is an essential consideration Penman ignores. Two Royal Princes just vanish from the Tower of London.  Poof!  And nobody thinks to tell the Lord Protector til so much time has passed it would look suspicious if he sounds an alarum.  Really?!?!<br /><br />Richard, the brilliant military commander and leader somehow forgot that security for the princes was important?  He forgot to use his best people and staffed the Tower with venal traitors who could be bought off to murder children?  Richard's just  a victim of peoples' high expectations--i.e., expecting the Lord Protector to protect his charges? Outrageous!!! What starts as  an interesting premise just collapses beneath it's own weighty contradictions.<br /><br />The truth is anyone of the three suspects would have happily killed the boys, as they happily killed each other when circumstances allowed.  All three probably lusted for power in equal measure.  However it was Richard with unlimited means and access to the princes.  He counted on people being afraid of the unrest that accompanies minor kings and he miscalculated people's revulsion.  Remember, after Tewksbury, the Lancasters were so effectively beaten there was no real opposition to the triumphant Yorkists.  And it wasn't that bad a gamble--after so much bloodshed what were two more deaths?  He miscalculated the enormous difference between honorable death on a battlefield and slitting the throats of children in their beds.  Three years later when Richard has overreached, his enemies have to go to the Welsh branch of the Lancaster family, the Tudors, to rally around a candidate.  But they do.<br /><br />It speaks volumes that after a generation of civil war, a nation so depleted and bleeding would be willing to go yet one more round. Half the country would  prefer to crown a Welsh earl (an upstart if there ever was one  before kneeling to a bona fide Plantagenat prince.) Nobody is THAT misunderstood.  Richard must have been truly despised.  To paraphrase Oscar Wilde:  \\"To lose a nephew is a great tragedy.  To lose two seems careless.\\"<br /><br />Diccon done it.  And he paid.gedy.  To lose two seems careless.\\"    Diccon done it.  And he paid.
B004SL6OBQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack is great, it is something that the kids and adults can enjoy together!
B004G6009K|4.0|As someone who grew up watching Disney (and other animated) movies and appreciates the art form as much as live action films for its freedom and creative license, I'm often one of the few childless adults in the theater when new animated films come out. There have been a rash of really good animated movies lately, and I was excited about this one. I think, for kids, this movie hits the mark very well; for adults, it's good but not quite classic material.<br /><br />The story has all the potential to be a classic, and the animation - while not the quite the same style as the hand-drawn classics - has its own charm that makes up for the occasional plasticy look. Mother Gothel (the villain) had the potential to be a villain on par with Frollo (Hunchback of Notre Dame) himself - a weaselly, malicious, evil user who plays mind games to keep their charge in line. And the music was beautiful, with good to great lyrics (depending on the song). So why on earth did they choose a pop singer for their music, or turn Mother Gothel's potential complex and brilliant character into a snide, obvious, one-dimensional meanie?<br /><br />The great music from the Disney classics is great because it is sung by people with the proper vocal range and steady voices; perhaps most importantly of all, they are singing to make beautiful music, not because of their trademark genre. From Hunchback of Notre Dame to Aladdin, Mulan to Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas to Sleeping Beauty, these songs are memorable for their classic beauty. No offense to Mandy Moore - who is a fine pop singer - but her singing was not at all suited for this role, and strongly detracted from the film.<br /><br />As for Mother Gothel's character, her constant snide-jabs-followed-by-quick-apologies had the effect of weakening the character greatly. I know people like this - who insult you and then laugh it off with, \\"Sorry, just kidding.\\" Other than themselves, I don't know anyone who thinks they are clever or witty; they are clearly, obviously nasty, and not even terribly intelligent in going about voicing their malice. Gothel, however, is not supposed to be an annoying, mean dimwit; she's supposed to be very clever and manipulative. Had they had her insult without offering apologies, or insult without laughing it off - and, when Rapunzel was insulted, chided her for being too touchy or sensitive, the effect would have been much better. She would not only have been mean and hurt her daughter's feelings, but she would have then laid a guilt trip on her as well for being \\"too sensitive\\". (I've known people like this, too, and they are a heck of a lot more effective than the other type). Disney * tried * to do this, but failed - instead, Mother Gothel comes across as a mean (but obviously so), catty, snide witch, rather than a clever manipulator. Instead of a female Frollo personality, they got a mosquito.<br /><br />These were my two biggest gripes with this movie, and what, to me, kept it from 5-star-classic material. Now, that said, this is still a good film - and one of the best ones Disney has put out in years, literally. Younger kids will probably not notice either of these points, and older ones may or may not find them as significant as I did. Rated 4/5 stars for a movie that was almost a classic.nasty, and not even terribly intelligent in going about voicing their malice.

0061726826|4.0|Imagine a world where love is illegal. It is believed to be a disease that makes people deranged. Teenagers are given an operation to remove the ability to fall into romantic love and are matched with someone. Authority figures go on raids to make sure no one is out after curfew and there are no secret trysts among those who have not been operated on yet.<br /><br />Lena is uncured, waiting for her operation. Her mother committed suicide because the disease amor deliria nervosa made her self-destructive. Lena meets a boy named Alex who appears to be cured--the cured have scars on their necks--but he isn't what he appears to be. When Lena realizes who he is and what he represents, she is afraid of her passion. Will she end up like her mother when she's swept away with feelings for Alex?<br /><br />The romance between Lena and Alex is gorgeous, especially mingled with the imagery and setting of the ocean and forest. The concept of forbidden love--as in medically and legally forbidden--is interesting. I enjoyed the novel immensely, although it was slow at times. When I look up info on the novel there's a #1 next to the title. If there's a follow-up book, I'd love to read it. I read this book via Netgalley, courtesy of the publisher.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|While I have enjoyed every season of this show, Season 1 was absolutely extraordinary and by far the best.  The whole story arc is probably the best season of anything that has aired on Showtime and the casting was great.  Not only is the story and the acting good, the cinematography and music are also outstanding and add a certain flair to the show.  Also worth noting is that the opening credits to this show is one of my all time favorites.  Highly recommended.

031261246X|5.0|I've long admired Mark's work, so when he used his knowlege to craft a story about cyber terrorism, I knew it would be an ejoyable and realistic read. While the character's are maybe not a deeply developed as say a Tom Clancy Novel (the old ones, not the current ones), the parts about malware and virus exploits are dead on. Read this and think about what life would be like with all the computer systems working right.

1433521784|5.0|Pros: Great quality book and binding.  - Very readable font  - Great articles, charts. At the risk of sounding prideful, which I hope I don't... For a bible college grad the study notes are sometimes... elementary? However the charts, outlines, and articles provide great insights and reminders!  - Bible opens flat, and closes flat. At this point the bible is fairly new and stays open in Genesis after the pages were separated (a few chapters in of course).  - The leather is much much nicer than the \\"genuine leather\\" options offered by Crossway (I had the ESV personal size study bible before this). Cover has the softness and suppleness of good trutone bibles, but breathes much nicer and (imo) with much nicer quality.    Cons:  - It's a big book, about as thick as the diameter of a 12oz/355mL soda can. The length is about two soda cans long, and the width is just under 1 1/2 soda cans long.  - I guess some reviewers have said this bible is quite weighty, but it's actually not bad. (Although holding my ESV thinline right afterwards feels like holding a feather so maybe it is heavy after all...)
B000V86OKG|4.0|Not a lot that needs to be said here that hasn't already been said.  A show that is definitely worth watching, even if it isn't quite as captivating as the first season.  Expands well on Dexter's character and background and still provides a compelling plot.

B002QW7ALM|5.0|I originally dismissed Pandorum as a Matrix clone, based on the artwork alone. I saw the tubes leading to the arm, and I thought of Neo in the Matrix. So in a case like this, I'll nearly stay with the original every time. A writer friend of mine recommended Pandorum, he thought I would like it based on the genre of movie I enjoy. This movie is no clone of Alien, I can assure you of that. Pandorum breaks the Alien format, by the team of people against the monstrous entity of the Space Ship growing in numbers as the movie goes on; this is instead of the pick apart one at a time elimination standard of other space horror movies. I dont want to give a plot summary in this review. What I do want to give is an impression to any potential viewer. The monsters in this movie will scare the crap out of you, like a cross between the Alien and the creatures in \\"I am legend\\" I wouldnt dare to reveal story points, they in fact are the reason to watch Pandorum. However, I myself was slightly disappointed that the creatures arent better explained. I wont even share my speculation here, its really up to the viewer I think. The relentless dark of the film, and CONSTANT action make way for a surprise ending. You wont believe where everything ends up. The product description by Amazon is right on. What struck me most is the production design, the lighting and color is among my favorite ever on film. Well worth multiple viewings just to take it all in.

B000G8NXYG|3.0|I purchased \\"Seven Samuari\\" because I have always enjoyed \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" even after multiple viewings and reviewers always helpfully point out that the latter is a Hollywood reinterpretation of the storyline. So I wondered what the original was like and anyway as a child I had always enjoyed watching \\"Shintaro\\" on TV.<br />First of all, I did enjoy \\"Seven Samuari\\" for itself, but can hardly believe there was only six years between production of it and \\"The Manificent Seven\\", which is decades ahead visually. I thought the recruitment period was laboured in \\"Samuari\\" and generally the whole film seened to drag a bit. Maybe \\"Samuari\\" also suffered in that I was only familiar with Toshiro Mifune whereas \\"Magnificent\\" was chock full of A-list stars.<br />I think \\"Seven Samuari\\" is well worth the look, especially if you are into the genre. It's just that \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" was magnificent.
0061478784|5.0|I first heard of this from the Miyazaki movie.  When wandering around my local bookstore, I saw this and since I loved the movie I decided to buy this book as well.  I am very glad that I did, this book was fantastic.    Characters    The story centers on three main characters, Sophie, Howl, and Michael.  While the book is written in an omniscient viewpoint, it focuses mostly on Sophie.  Sophie is a wonderful character who gets through her problems often through sheer persistence.  Howl is a bit of a slacker who tries to avoid doing any work that he can avoid and has a wonderfully sarcastic attitude towards the world.  Michael is Howl's apprentice who helps Sophie adjust to living with the wizard.    Setting    The name of the world is never given, but the world is a typical medieval world with wizards running around changing things.  The most interesting thing about the setting is Howl's castle.  As per the title of the book, his castle moves on it's own.  This is interesting and plays an interesting part in the story.    Plot    Sophie is the oldest of three sisters and she works in a hat shop.  After her father dies, her two sisters are sent off to apprentice with a baker and a wizard while Sophie stays at the hat shop.  After working at the shop for some time, Sophie gets frustrated and takes it out on a customer, who happens to be the Witch of the Waste.  This doesn't bode well for Sophie as the Witch curses her and makes her age so that she is closer to 90 years old.  After this she sets out to get away from her old life and ends up living with Howl and Michael.    Enjoyment    Although it's never really fair to compare the book to the movie, in this case, both are excellent.  The first half of the book and movie are essentially the same, but while they differ from there they are both excellent.  I loved this book and read it in one day, I didn't want to put it down.    Overall Grade    I loved this book, and for that matter, I loved the movie as well.  They're both excellent and I highly suggest both.  But this review is for the book, which is what this score is for.    10/10    All of my reviews are available on my blog.  Check out my profile for the info.
0312370849|2.0|During the Vélodrome d'Hiver round-up in 1942, French police tore thousands of French jews, mostly women and children, from their homes and kept them in squalid conditions in a stadium before transporting them on French owned trains to their deaths at Auschwitz.  This incident is so blindingly tragic that I would think even an inferior author couldn't help but tell the story in a way that is heartbreaking, infuriating, and fully alive. I was wrong. de Rosnay tells the story in a split narrative, starting with a French child, Sarah, who is rounded up with her parents in the Vél d'Hiver, torn from them forcibly, and sent to a camp where thousands of children are kept in a camp without food, water or adult supervision. Before the family is taken from home, Sarah hides her 3 year old brother in a hidden cupboard that she alone carries the key to. Her story tells her brave attempt to escape from the camp and rescue him. The narrative then switches to Julia Jarmond, a bland, self-pitying American ex-pat living in Paris. Compared to the hellish events of 1942, Julia's story never had a chance to be compelling. As it is, it is painfully banal.     SPOILERS    From the first descriptions of her charming, rogueish French husband, I could tell the author was setting Julia up leave him. He teases her. They don't listen to each other. And on and on. The issue that finally makes them reach the point of no return is outrageously contrived- I didn't believe for an instant any people would act or react this way. How on earth did deRosnay think this lame story of upper middle class marital ennui would tie in satisfactorily with Jewish genocide, aided by the French?       While writing a story for a magazine, Julia discovers that her apartment was once inhabited by Sarah's family, and she goes on a search to find out about Sarah, and eventually find her. Along the way, she discovers secrets that have been hidden by her in-laws for 60 years. This is the key reason why this story never gets off the ground- there is simply no urgency or narrative drive in discovering what happened 60 years after the fact. Of course it was terrible. Of course Sarah's life was shattered. Not only that, but Julia's family secrets are contrived for no apparent reason other than moving this weak plot along. The events of the Vél d'Hiver and Sarah have been kept secret from Julia's in-laws for 60 years because of an inexplicable death-bed promise from the family patriarch. Why? The events were well known. France made holocaust denial a crime. There was no reason everyone would have kept it quiet. Julia's obsession with finding out about Sarah is also implausible. (So are the obstacles she faces- her husband keeps protesting with arguments like \\"leave the past alone.\\" Pathetic.) She didn't know about her existence only months ago, but now Julia is jetting off back and forth from the Atlantic and showing up at doors without thinking to call and verify her information first. And why? What is her burning goal? To say that she's sorry. That she remembers. None of this adds up to a story that keeps you turning pages. Character development is non-existant. We know nothing of Sarah after she is about 11. We hear nothing from people who actually survived or witnessed the Vélodrome d'Hiver. The only point the author makes, which she makes over and over, with little variation, is that it was terrible, and people should remember. She sheds no light, adds no insight, fails to humanize. This story should have been told from the perspective of people that were actually involved. Its hard to believe that I read a novel about one of the greatest human tragedies of all history, and the only thing that was really dealt with was Julia's pathetic relationship troubles and middling sense of self.     If you want to read a book about WWII that adds something new, something humanizing and heartbreaking and worthwhile, try the Book Thief or the Guernsey Potato Peel Society.

I used these in a x86 mikrotik installation and I got consistent 975 Mbps half duplex UDP, try that with the other brands...  They are better quality and better supported.  but if your using this for home use, you will probably never notice a difference between the Intel and Netgear/Linksys nic's.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|No matter how great a filmmaker Martin Scorsese is---and he's one of the best in the USA----this is a documentary that could have ended up being a disaster had its subject, the former Robert Alan Zimmerman and present Bob Dylan, refused to cooperate in making it. The biggest plus here is that not only did he cooperate, but Dylan turns out to be disarmingly straightforward during his interview, the binding glue for the program. Perhaps this was because production was so close to the release of his own memoirs, CHRONICLES VOLUME 1, that Dylan felt an imperative to set the record straight for everyone who, in the past, could have been forgiven for not being sure if he was ever forthcoming when not performing. In any case, Dylan comes off in NO DIRECTION HOME as very assured of how he remembered his early years up to the end of 1966, and the corraborations of his recollections by such fellow travelers as Joan Baez, Dave Van Ronk, Izzy Young, Pete Seeger and others definetely gives the right feeling of authenticity. Scorsese fleshes out his program with deft uses of archival concert and news footage, including several moments from Dylan's last concert tour of England with The Hawks (later The Band) prior to the motorcycle crash that sidelined him for the bulk of 1967. THAT footage is extraordinary, if only because you see how raw and unfettered his band sound really was, but the moments taken from various outdoor festivals, TV shows and indoor concerts from 1961 to 1966 are just as incredible.<br /><br />Throughout it all, one central theme emerges; Bob Dylan knew from the get-go how to tap into most of the aspects that make the difference between a good performer and a great one. If you've ever even now still find yourself pulling out BLONDE ON BLONDE or HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and getting blown away by what you find there, you MUST see this documentary.

0316069353|3.0|I'm pretty amazed that this book already has more reviews than Connelly's last book, The Reversal....most of them complaining about E-book prices. I wonder how many of them planned on buying the book to begin with, but there you go. If you like a popular author, you should expect to maybe pay a bit more for his books when they first come out. It's the way the world works, people. If it bothers you wait for the paperback.     Anyway, onto the review itself. The Fifth Witness is a solid courtroom novel, and at times quite a page-turner. Like The Reversal, once we actually get to the trial, the novel surges with electricity and intensity that I wish was present throughout more of it.     Looking at Connelly's last few books, (The Overlook, Brass Verdict, 9 Dragons, The Reversal) his style has definitely changed in recent years. With the exception of Brass Verdict, which I actually think is one of his best, he seems to be favoring simpler and more straightforward plots in his latest books, and this one's no exception. The main case here just isn't all that interesting, and never really expands beyond how it begins. Gone are the clockwork plots and revelations that Connelly's books used to be known for, replaced with a much more straightforward approach, though in this case it seems to be even a bit moreso than in the past.     Other problems include the fact that the defendant's so unlikable (which is the point, to Connelly's credit) that it's even harder to really care much about what happens to her. Regarding Haller, it's always entertaining to read his 1st person narration, though this book doesn't do a whole lot to develop his character. Maggie looks to me like she's turning into an Eleanor Wish-type of character and I *really* hope I'm wrong about that. Their relationship kind of got on my nerves this time around.     All that said, and I can't stress this enough, this is a quality book. Connelly's one of my favorite writers and he knows how to grab you and pull you along for the ride, and once we get to the courtroom, that's exactly what happens. The book's ending was surprising and I didn't see it coming, though it could have used a bit more explanation, as I'm still not entirely sure what was actually true and what wasn't.     The foreclosure angle's something Connelly hasn't explored much in the past, but there's not much there to explore, and I think that all the explanations required so that the reader can understand the somewhat complex workings of this system bog the book down in its first 1/3.     If I sound harsh, it's just because I have huge respect for Michael Connelly and that may lead me to sometimes expect too much. To me though this represents \\"middle of the road\\" Connelly. Neither his best nor his worst, just average. Nothing really we haven't seen before. I hope we see a return to the more complex plotlines that Connelly used to be known for, but either way, I'll continue to buy and enjoy every single book he puts out.     And in the grand scheme of things, paying $14 for a hardcover really doesn't strike me as all that outrageous. But what are you going to do...Sure, it would be nice if the publisher would take this reaction into account, but really, it's not the book's or the author's fault.
1439156816|5.0|To start, I'm an author. I need to preface this review with that fact, as I don't know how engaging this may have been, had I not had such an investment in the topic myself.    That being said, anyone with absolutely any interest in the craft of writing can surely benefit from the wisdom between these pages. Much less a 'how to write' book and so much more, as it says, 'a memoir of the craft,' King comes off as nuturing rather than preachy, and entertaining rather than dry.     His advice is sound. Think of the last book you read that left you feeling a little less than satisfied. After reading On Writing, I promise you can pick out exactly what made that book lackluster, as King is a master of analyzing not only the faults of others, but his own as well.     A window into King's otherwise fairly unobserved writing life, I highly reccomend this to any writers, King fans, or anyone just looking for a good non-fiction read.    Overall, 5/5.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|Ben Affleck delivers a hardcore film about bank jobs and crime crews in a town that is filled with them. For movie fans who enjoy bank robbery films, you must add this to your list (or queue). The Town may remind viewers of films like Lookout or Thief with a modern feel. The film doesn't focus too much on the bank robbing side of the plot nor the character drama. However, the viewer is given just enough of both to be able to follow the fast moving plot. Also, the methods used during the bank jobs are interesting and original. Overall it is a good movie in the genre and in general.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Michaelmatician has not commented on The Town. Allegedly he spoke briefly with Affleck about the film's conclusion as well as the benefits of including grapefruit in one's diet.<br /><br />2.342
B0041KKYEM|5.0|An absolutely incredible psychological horror film, I think this flick has the potential to reach classic status sooner rather than later.    First off, I absoluely loved the atmospherics of this film. The direction was absolutely fantastic, and I couldn't be happier with the way the film was realized from beginning to end.    The symbolism is spot-on - this is a film about a classic crisis with the Shadow in the Jungian sense, and it couldn't have been better. Portman is forced to face the darker half of herself in the most brutal way possible, and the cast and crew pulled it off magnificently. The use of mirrors to examine oneself in the most critical light was well done, as it wasn't thrust in your face but if you picked up on it early, you could certainly see what was kept in mind while filming.    Portman, representing the Id in this case, was fantastic. Her childish, controlled ways fighting to emerge so perfectly captured the psyche entering the realm of the crisis. Her mother, controlling these urges and repressing anything she found societal controls would disprove of, worked wonderfully to carry the point across. And Kunis - oh Kunis - her depiction of the shadow blending into the realm of the Id was just too good.    Well recommended - especially for a double-viewing. Watch once to take it in, watch again to examine.    5/5.
1440419043|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

0061726826|3.0|This book grabbed me from the second I read the first page. The idea that the government had brainwashed almost an entire population into becoming emotionless machines intrigued me. I had to find more out about what life was like in Lena's town. I enjoyed reading from Lena's point of view and found her a likeable protagonist. I liked that she was strong minded and confident about her opinion on society from the start of the book but not stubborn enough to discount other ideas.     The romance between Lena and Alex was interesting and I was relieved when I heard about why he liked her, that it was not just \\"I saw you, I wanted you.\\" I liked that Alex did not appear on every second page, their encounters were spaced nicely, letting the readers also discover more about Lena and her friend Hana. However, I would have been glad to see more detail about Lena and Hana's relationship; it seems to have just sprung out of nowhere and I did not like how Lena was always putting herself down in comparison to Hana. There were moments when I felt like I was right beside Lena and will say that Oliver has done a fantastic job in bringing this story to life as well as effectively targeting my emotions. Lena's character evolved nicely and I was glad to see many changes in her at the end of the book, viewing her as a brave heroine, fighting for something she believes in.     I was however, disappointed in the lack of elaboration. I wanted to know more about the people in other countries, why the government decided to brainwash everybody, who started the idea that love was a disease. I found it clever how at the start of every chapter Oliver would insert quotes referenced from government books in Lena's world. The storyline was also a little predictable but good writing overcame this and still made for a brilliant ending.     The ending left Lena and Alex in my heart after a gut wrenching last chapter and I will be eagerly awaiting the next book in the series.

B003VANOFY|3.0|These headphones are pretty good for gaming but I get a lot of crackling while listening to music. I'm pretty confident this is not interference with the wireless signal, but between the chipset / usb controller or something. There are tons of complaints on the Logitech forums with various suggestions for fixing, although I haven't found a way to completely eliminate the crackling. Your mileage may vary.    Also, to power them on and off, you have to hold the button for a few seconds. I can not get this to behave consistently even after knowing how it is supposed to function. Why not just push it once? They turn off automatically when no audio is played for a few minutes to conserve battery life... even when plugged in and charging. It gets really annoying trying to turn them on several times throughout the day.    Some users don't realize that these will completely bypass your sound card and show up as a separate device.    I wish I had gotten a regular pair of headphones with a 3.5mm jack instead of USB.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I popped disk one of The Walking Dead into my dvd player figuring I would watch one episode before I went to bed.  Six episodes later I was very tired but very content after watching all of season one.  This is a great series and I can't wait for it to return to television this fall.    I had never heard of this series or the graphic novel upon which it is based.  I figured I would try it because I have liked end of the world stories/movies since reading A Canticle for Liebowitz (a 1960 post-apocalyptic novel by Walter Miller) as a young teen. Also, Shawshank Redemption, written and directed by Frank Darabont,  is one of my favorite movies of all time and I was intrigued to see Darabont was the writer and executive producer of The Walking Dead.    What got me hooked from the moment I started watching  were the characters. This is not a blood and guts horror movie with stereotypical characters used to take up time between action sequences.  This is a movie where well crafted characters, whose lives have been turned upside down because a virus has destroyed most of civilization, try to survive.     The series begins with Rick and Shane, two small town Georgia cops, talking about life and chasing a bad guy.  Rick is shot and wakes up from a coma to find an empty hospital full of bodies.  After realizing he is not dreaming he runs into Morgan and his son who let him know that a virus is killing people and turning them into zombies. The zombies then feed on living things including people.      One of the first really moving scenes was Morgan's dilemma over what to do about his wife who has contracted the virus. I won't mention any more for those who have not seen the series.    I found all six episodes extremely well written. For someone like me who is not into gore, I found the occasional literal blood and guts scenes (we are talking zombies here) necessary and by no means gratuitous. While I think you could have replaced the zombies with any other threatening creatures, I understand from watching the extras that this is based on  The Walking Dead graphic novel series, which has a big following. Clearly Darabont had great material to work with and from the extras I have learned that he is faithful to the Walking Dead series in many instances. I plan to read this series next.    If you like great acting, well crafted characters, exciting action scenes, fascinating character interaction, great dialogue and tons of suspense watch this series.  Plus you get some great zombies thrown in as well. I can't think of a better end of the world/survivor movie.      I keep using the word movie, instead of series, because I feel like I watched a movie.  In fact, in one of the extras that came with the series, Darabont explains that AMC told him that they wanted him to create something movie like.  As a result he shot on location when he could and he created this series as if he was creating a movie.    The series started with six episodes so that's all you get in season one. There are some good extras talking about how the series came to be and with interviews with cast, crew and Robert Kirkman who wrote the graphic novel.     The final episode was great. It ended with me wanting more but I also was pleased that it tied things up sufficiently for me to feel like the six episodes combined had a beginning, middle and end. The characters are still trying to figure out how to survive but I was not left with a cliff hanger, wondering for months until the series resumes, whether some key character was alive or dead.    I can't wait for more episodes. I eagerly await season two on DVD.

0307593495|3.0|I've been a thorough Kurt Wallander fan, and had been looking forward to reading this final installment for many months. I enjoyed the read, but was disappointed by the simplicity of the plot and the continual references to Wallander's sense of loss and preoccupations of death. Yes, Wallander had been diagnosed with depression in a past novel, and had (rashly) decided to stop taking medication, but the continual references to his sadness and his thoughts of Sweden having left behind its better days were too numerous not to be annoying. Simply editing out half of them would have made the book more enjoyable and still would have conveyed Wallander's usual sense of depression. I did enjoy the plausibility of this novel's plot more than a few of the past Wallander plots that seem too far removed from reality (e.g., a villain causing a worldwide financial meltdown by abusing an ATM machine). I also enjoyed the connections to the residue of the Cold War, as well as the tying up of many of the \\"loose ends\\" of Wallander's past relationships.  Overall, I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't recommend this novel as a first Wallander novel.  Read them in order, and if you like them, read this one last. As a thriller or police procedural, its plot won't win awards, but the (apparent) sense of closure brought to the Wallander series seemed fitting and tastefully done.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I'm trying to wait to write this review. I seem to think each book I've read is the \\"greatest one ever\\" as I finish it. I've read very few that I really disliked.<br />  But...The Troubled Man is exceptional. I refuse to spoil this book for you by giving away anything but these following comments should interest you:<br />What does a man feel and think who is worried about dying?<br />What are the human thoughts that go on in his mind and in the minds of others? Can you stand the sensation of being \\"inside\\" these characters?<br />Wallander is like me: we both thought that we should get away from our jobs and work but we ended up stuck in our work -- preoccupied with it -- and missed too much of life. And now you can get inside the mind of a man who makes and lives this mistake.<br />Can a plot that is assuredly heading in one direction logically reverse?<br />Can you be as astute as detective Wallander?  Can you catch the nuances that influence his investigation?<br />What does it feel like to be the detective on a case and have momentary flashes of the solution but not definitive enough to solve the case?<br />What does it feel like to be deeply in love and then....?<br />What would you do if you caught one of your most admired friends in a colossal lie?<br />What are the indicators that you may be getting senile?  Are they valid?<br />Is it possible that you can not ever love again?<br />Is the situation that you are investigating (during your vacation when you ought to be relaxing) have anything more than a small and local influence?<br />Might the situation be international?<br />  Try to read the earlier Detective Wallander books first. There is back story for this book in the earlier books but this book can be read by itself and it has enough explanation of the back story items.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag recently replaced my old camera bag which was not cutting it.  I easily fit my 3 lenses and my Canon 50D, along with plenty of other travel items.  The build quality is superb, and I love the rubber ends on the zippers.  There are so many pockets internally as well, which was a much added bonus.

B000OPO6VU|5.0|I originally bought this album back in 1972 when I was 15. At the time I thought this was a great record. Keith Emerson was partly responsible for getting me to listen to classical music, I also liked his previous band The Nice. I lost my vinyl copy of Trilogy in the 1980s. Last week I purchased the CD and enjoyed it all over again. ELP were excellent musicians and they were at their peak when they made this album.<br /><br />ELP's music stands up better than much of the stuff from that era. Most rock bands of that time were mainly influenced by the blues, ELP was influenced by European classical music. Keith Emerson could really play the piano, listen to &quot;Fugue.&quot; I have always loved Greg Lake's song &quot;From The Beginning&quot; and I didn't realize that Aaron Copeland wrote &quot;Hoedown&quot; until a couple of years later. &quot;Trilogy&quot; is probably my favorite track.<br /><br />ELP were real musicians but they became one of those bands that the music critics hated. They will never make it into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame just like Yes, King Crimson, Focus, Deep Purple and the Moody Blues. In fact, most of the bands I liked around that time. Zeppelin and Floyd sold too many records to be excluded. It is sad that rock music started to regress later in the decade. Pioneering bands like ELP were discouraged from pushing the envelope. Anything ambitious was viewed as pretentious. For fans of prog rock, this is a record worth listening to.

B004L49JYO|2.0|This is not a review of the movie, but of the Bluray itself.  If you're into this new wave of Japanese splatter flicks then you know what to expect, and Tokyo Gore Police is amongst the best of its kind.    However, Media Blasters has dropped the ball with this release.  Or, rather, someone in their art department is just incredibly lazy.  The back cover has been copied and pasted from their 2 disc DVD edition.  This Bluray release is ONE disc, not two.  Furthermore, the listed bonus material (TGP short films, behind the scenes) are not on the disc.  What you do get is a trailer for the film and for other Tokyo Shock releases.    The transfer is expectedly average (these cheaply shot and quickly made features are never going to sparkle), and there are DTS-HD 5.1 audio tracks in both Japanese and English.    It just boggles the mind that these kinds of oversights happen in this day and age.  For shame, Media Blasters.

0756404738|2.0|I enjoyed Rothfuss' first book, and though I wasn't waiting on the edge of my seat for the sequel, I expected it to be a good read. Unfortunately, as others have noted, it's a very messy and disjointed follow-up that took the story nowhere in 1000 pages. It can be broken into 6 stories (almost \\"episodes\\"): time at the University, time in Vintas, the search for bandits, time learning how to have great sex, time learning karate, and the framing story. Too much happens in the book in too short of a timeline! And yet though \\"too much\\" happens, very little actually does. The time at the University is arguably the most interesting; the time in Vintas is dull; the search for the bandits is tedious; the time with Felurian is mind-numbingly dull; and the time with the Adem is nonsensical. All the while, the framing story of Kvothe as an old innkeeper continues to plod steadily nowhere! I was unaware until reading some of the reviews on here that this is predicted to be a trilogy. That's not going to happen, or if it does, it certainly will require a 3rd novel of an entirely different pace or size to complete the story he's set up.     His writing voice is very pleasant to read, particularly his dialogue between characters who he has developed over the 2 books (except Denna and Kvothe; that's just tedious). My low rating for the book is not for his potential as a good storyteller or for a poorly stylized book. The low rating is because of a 1000-page novel with a plot that feels derivative (Adem = Aiel from Jordan) and wholly contrived.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss, by Stephanie Perkins, is my #1 pick of 2010.    I stopped reading most contemporary YA romance novels a few years ago. When I read, I want to escape reality. So paranormal and fantasy books swiftly took over my reading list. I'm so glad I broke my self-imposed rule to read this book! I'd been hearing nothing but good things via twitter posts from authors I admire (Like Kiersten White, and Rachel Hawkins) for months. So when I found Anna on the shelf a month early at the Strand in NYC, I was ecstatic...Then I let it sit on my shelf for a month. I'm a firm believer that books \\"choose you\\" when it's the right time to read them. The blizzard that struck the Northeast the day after Christmas ended up providing me with the prime reading opportunity. Now that it's made my best of 2010 list, I'm a bit mad at myself for not reading it sooner!    The story is so incredibly well written, honest, and REAL. Stephanie Perkins has perfectly captured what it feels like to be a teenager, and unsure of yourself or your heart. Anna is cute, smart, and has the strength to stand up for herself. Against her better judgment, she falls hopelessly in love with her (taken) new best friend Etienne St. Clair, but refuses to let him walk all over her in the process.    As for St. Clair? He's gorgeous, charismatic, and funny, but not too perfect. From his physical appearance (he's short, and has some crooked teeth) to his behavior (his inability to dump his girlfriend for Anna, running away from his problems), he's a wonderfully flawed love interest.    The romance development is slow, almost painfully slow. But the story is even sweeter for it. There are dozens of accidental touches--like knees brushing in a dark theatre- before kissing comes in to play. Plenty of obstacles stand between the two lovers: a girlfriend, a potential boyfriend, and a handful of misunderstandings. And of course, time-they're only in Paris for a year. Rather than being \\"soul mates\\" (gag) whose world revolves around their lover, Anna and Etienne get to know each other gradually over the course of that year, before realizing they're in love. Together, they bring out the best in each other, like true love should.    Unlike a lot of books I've been reading lately, even the secondary characters are fully developed. From Anna and St. Clair's circle of friends, to St. Clair's mother (whom we never even meet!) to Anna's little brother. I felt like I knew each of them, and was right there in the middle of the action with them. And the action just happens to be non-stop. There isn't a single dull moment in the entire book, which had me hooked by the second page. I can't wait to read the two companion novels \\"Lola and the Boy Next Door\\" and \\"Isla and the Happily Ever After\\", which come out in 2011, and 2012 respectively. After reading Anna and the French Kiss, Stephanie Perkins has definitely been added onto my favorite authors list. Not only is her book amazing, she has an adorable blog, with stories from her life, and trials of getting her work published. She's so open and honest about it all, it's like reading the blog of a close friend.    Anna and the French Kiss is the one book of 2010 I'll be recommending to every reader I know, regardless of age, sex, or \\"preferred reading genre\\".    It's just that good!
1408815109|5.0|This is a story of a spiritual awakening. A woman who is gifted and very intelligent making decisions that will determine the rest of her life, she wants to be sure she is making the right decisions. Her story about how she went about making her life better for herself is inspiring. A really good read.

B000YDG5X4|5.0|These Earthkeepers are worth your interest if you are moving trough different environments and climates. They are not built for long walks because of thin rubber sole and a flat footbed but this can be fixed with an improved inner sole. They are big in size, choose a smaller shoenumber! They remind me of the vantage boots my ancestors used decades ago, nice look and feel! The quality seems to be good. No doubt! My new favourite traveling shoes:) Recommended.
0812550706|4.0|The first time I read this book was after it was given to me by a recruiter for the USMC. I enjoyed it then, but had forgotten about it until it showed up on my recommended page here on Amazon. I am not a huge Science Ficton fan, but this book delves deep into the human mind better than most books out there. If you like books that engross you in the thought process of it's characters then Ender's Game is for you.
0765322889|5.0|Where do I start...    Pick this book up. Get it on your Kindle or find the hard copy.    I've said it before and I'll say it again, but one of those books is the ONLY book I've EVER cried to (yes, in real life) while reading. No, I won't name which book. Suffice it to say that you, dear reader, will be exposed to moments of pathos severe enough to strip away the armor of your heart and expose your soul to its compassion, love and pain.    There's sadness in the books... but there's happiness too. Hope, despair, glory, tragedy, victories, failures... it's all blended in to a series which takes me for a ride every time I dive in.    I may be scorned for this but it could be the very best fantasy I've ever read (and that includes Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and Brooks (and others). Steven Erikson weaves a tale that left and continues to leave me breathless.    There's only one obstacle you need to know about: the \\"epic\\" nature of the series. It has its own index of characters. It starts you out in the middle (in medias res) of the story similar to Homer's The Iliad and The Odyssey. Much is similar between Erikson and Homer. Luckily (for me, anyway) Steven Erikson chose not to write in that iambic pentameter prose.    So at times, you may be lost or confused as to why you're being introduced to some character or storyline you've never heard of before. I hope that you read and make your way through the story so that you can say \\"Whoa, so those people did all that? So this person is really THAT person from that book? ...Unbelievable.\\" You'll get to those points. Those points and more as you experience Erikson's masterpiece.    Yeah, I'm obsessed with the series. After all, have YOU ever read a series that made you actually show your emotions in real life? I have and it's this series.     Go right now and get it. You won't be disappointed.
B004G5ZXVQ|1.0|REM was a fine, albeit not great, group in the mid eighties to the early nineties (from Murmur to Automatic for the People).  Great artists know when to put the brush down, to put the final period on the short story, to stop writing songs once they become only a shadow of what they were once capable of creating.  Both U2 and REM have milked it for fifteen years, tbeir work becoming more tiresome with each new release (which regrettably do not sound new but like retreads - and flat, bald retreads at that).  Those who feel Led Zeppelin should have continued without Bonham, take heed.  Stipe's lyrics have always been dangerously close to mindless gibberish, but at least the music was good.  I wish they would stop tarnishing their image and give it up while their fans have enough good will to disregard the albums after Automatic - two more albums as weak as this one will bury any fond memories and make us believe that the early albums were flukes.  What is perhaps most eggregious is their attempting to resurrect their earlier style and plagiarize themselves for big bucks.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|This movie was a great movie. I loved it. Yes it was a typical \\"middle book\\" so it leaves you hanging and it seems to go a bit slow in places. No it doesnt follow the book to the letter but then none of the movies have followed the books to that degree. It would be impossible to do so. If they tried it would make Lord of the Rings look like a short story. Taking all of that into account I like the character progressions in the story. I will watch it again and again as I will the whole series.
B0000Z0HMQ|5.0|This is one of those stop-motion animation movies at it's best! And Ray Harryhausen is his name. Made in 1969 you have Cowboys and Dinosaurs.What more can you ask for? The story is a bit hokey,but the dinosaurs make up for it. And if you watch closely you can see it pay homage to King Kong and other movies that he did. If your into \\" Monster Movies\\" this is your movie. There is another movie out there if you can find it...with Cowboys and Dinosaurs...it's called \\"The Beast of Hollow Mountain\\" made in 1956 and Willis O'Brien was involved. Here's the story...You have a wild west showman who wants his woman back...she has a wild west show...they find a small extinct animal...there are gypsy's involved...mayhem ensues...find valley of dinosaurs...mayhem ensues again...catch dino...more mayhem...and you should see this movie. The bonus features are pretty good...especially \\"Return to the Valley\\" I recommend this movie highly! If your into Harryhausen and Dinosaurs...this is your movie!
B004NSVE3W|4.0|Did I enjoy reading AN ABOUNDANCE OF KATHERINES by John Green?... Let's just say, by the end of page one... well more like the pre-page one, \\"The Beginning (of the End)\\", I had a huge grin on my face. I'd say that's an excellent start.<br /><br />So what we have here is definitely an original concept about Colin Singleton, who although being a skinny, Jew-fro sporting prodigy, shockingly, can be quite lacking on the social front. Devastated by the latest Katherine in his life dumping him right after their high school graduation and obsessed over the possibility of never being more than a once child prodigy, he is convinced by his best (and only) friend to take a summer road trip.<br /><br />Now for me the best friend Hassan, an overweight Arab, was the key to this book's success. Although Colin's story is interesting, it is Hassan, who is freaking hilarious, that carries the book through. One of my favorite quotes of his is... \\"I'm not a terrorist.\\" ...Which appears multiple times at one point as the healing road trip takes them through Gutshot, the \\"sticks\\" of Tennessee.<br /><br />Even with a pretty predictable ending, AN ABOUNDANCE OF KATHERINES is a clever read with lots of intriguing, sometimes amusing and often bizarre factoids, as well as some complicated math (fortunately understanding said math is not necessary to the success of the story, just the easy to grasp theory behind the math). And I loved that there was a fitting and interesting explanation for the curse word substitution of \\"fug\\" and its variations; giving a less forced feel for the substitution, while accomplishing a more agreeable and youth friendly read.<br /><br />Along with my recommendation for this book, I'll leave you with a great Colin quote...<br />\\"Books are the ultimate Dumpees: put them down and they'll wait for you forever; pay attention to them and they always love you back.\\"
0394873742|5.0|My daughters had this book when they were little and they LOVED it!    I just purchased a new one for my granddaughter and it is as fabulous as we all remembered it to be.  It stands the test of time and brings many hours of enjoyment.
B000006NX5|5.0|I cannot begin trying to express the words in my heart to really try and explain about this album. Barry White is like no other. I remember him saying all to well that he had encountered some trouble early on in his life time. And I beleive I heard him say that he had a minor brush with the law, and he said; I recall of being in a predictment in his Life at this time, and he said he remember that he heard 'Elivis Presley sing a song, that he said make a difference in his lfe that day forward...and the name of that song, was ( \\"It's now or never\\"). However Barry really made a great singer and record producer, that never will be forgotton.    I just came in from work one afternoon with a cold soda in my hand, as I entered my apartment I was so tried and worn out from work, I just flopped down right on to the couch. And flip the news on. And one of the fastest bundle of sad news hit me dead in the face from the news station. I heard All time great singer of Love and ballard songs.....Barry White died today. It tore me apart into tears I shedded and my cold soda went another direction. Here is a man that I really looked up to as a teenager growing up and have known Barry for many many many many long down through the years of my life, ....NOW HE IS DEAD!    It really threw me for a loop, BIG TIME!!! I loved his music. This CD here one among just about all of them that I loved so much I still play it today, sometimes it is very hard for to listen to. It is a great CD...although I still have it in a cassette form as well. I cannot expres in my real word what it means to me. It has such an IMPACT of all of the 1970's music. I miss Barry White as well. May God bless his soul.

0061733199|2.0|I really hate to write a bad review - especially for a book that is raved about by so many.  But it really needs to be pointed out that much of this book is terribly outdated.<br /><br />I'm an instructor trainer for the American Red Cross (meaning I train new instructors) and have been for years.  Many of the First Aid techniques from CPR to pressure points to tourniquets and more described in this book are techniques we used to teach in the 1980's and have since either been discredited, proven ineffective or been drastically updated.  And for a book which claims to be \\"revised\\" in 2009, the things taught here are appalling and could actually cause more harm than good.<br /><br />Knowing how out-dated just the First Aid section of the book was created a real credibility issue for me on the rest of the book.  I'm sure much, if not most of the information is accurate (as was some of the first aid), but I wasn't willing to chance my survival or the survival of my family on 1980s data or opinion, so I returned it.  There's better out there.
B002NZK5VY|5.0|My wife is a big Sandra Bullock fan and we didn't have this one in our video library.  We often group movies we want to buy together so they qualify for free shipping.  That was the case with this purchase.      Unlike at least one other reviewer, we had absolutely no problems at all with the DVD transfer.  In fact, when played in a Blu-ray player with DVD enhancing technology, the image was almost as sharp as a Blu-ray.  The Dolby 5.1 sound filled the room when played through our sound system.  As DVD tranfers go \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is one of the best.
B001E45XT4|5.0|As a gamer, I need to hear the footsteps of opponents or to just enjoy a fuller immersive experience when gaming.<br /><br />Here are my experiences:<br /><br />- Strong lows and highs and a mid range volume. At every volume level, sound and bass is clear and crisp.<br /><br />- The padding in the ear and top of the headset are very comfortable. There padding is soft and sits well on the head and ears.<br /><br />- They can be used for your mp3 player. They sound great on my Itouch. Again, bass is very crisp and clear. Love it!<br /><br />- The headset is designed very nicely. You can pull it out and place back against the headset and effectively put it away when not using it.<br /><br />- You may want to pay an extra $20 for the updated 555 Gamecome version if you like. There is a difference in sound quality.<br /><br />In any case, great product for $25. Must buy for casual to serious gamers!
B000JQUHLM|5.0|The book was entertaining, even sweet (in a good way).  It's something you could actually read to your children.  Pollyanna's game of always finding something to be glad about would be a good one to practise in these depressing days.<br /><br />Plus, it was free on Kindle!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Beautiful score - it totally captures the spirit of the story and accompanies the film brilliantly.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the tracks seem to be out of order. Usually, soundtracks are presented in the order of which they appear in the film, but this one is very jumbled and doesn't follow the story line in terms of sequence of the tracks. I don't think this should in any way reflect upon anyone's decision to purchase this CD, but just be aware of this tiny detail!

I really love this new series with the acclaim of Downton Abbey and can't wait to see more of both soon!
B000007NZ5|5.0|I didnt discover Martin-era Sabbath until the era was over unfortunately.  I bought this one, Tyr, and Cross Purposes, the great Eternal Idol, and Id rather forget Forbidden.  This Headless Cross is every bit as good as Tyr.  Martin is a powerful singer and sounds barely contained in most of the songs on this disc.  The low end is very there, and Iommi is in all his glory as always.  Standout tracks are:  When Death Calls (a haunting, chilling heavy tune that will keep you up at night), Kill in the Spirit World (when one spirit murders another - yeah its deep), Bad Moon Rising, Call of the Wild, Devil and Daughter, Nightwing.  Did I mention that Tony Martin kicks ass on this disc?  I love Dio, RIP, but Martin proves hes worthy of carrying the greatest metal band in the world.....ever.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|In the DVD interview that accompanies the deluxe set (short addition, but highly recommended), Mr. Simon says he wanted to make a record that went back to originating a song centered on the MELODY instead of the RHYTHM, unlike all of the records he's made starting with Graceland up until now.<br /><br />Mission successful.<br /><br />This is Paul Simon's greatest work since Graceland, and perhaps even MORE powerful because it is more intimate. Recorded in close quarters in  a \\"garage style\\" situation live, this thing lives breathes, and moves. I was quite surprised to hear Paul's sweet voice still sounds excellent \\"after all these years\\".<br /><br />The musicianship, as always is impeccable, and there's different things coming at you all over the place to catch your attention. The engineering and production is absolute perfection.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, welcome back Mr. Simon and open up your heart to this beautiful record. I can guarantee you will NOT say \\"So What?\\"...
B000005J56|5.0|This is a fabulous cd! I love it, my mom loves it, and my six year old niece loves it. It really makes you dream of cool summer evenings, dancing under the stars. Good buy for anyone who loves music.

B0026UV77C|5.0|Battle for the Sun has some real standout songs and that's good, but it also plays up the inconsistencies. Somehow, with no really bad tracks on it, the album almost/sorta/doesn't cohere. (I give it five stars anyway, because anything I love gets five.) I couldn't put my finger on where it fails to knock me off my feet, the way Meds, their previous album, did. I think it has to do with the first two tracks. Kitty Litter and Ashtray Heart are fun, fast, snarky and quirky, but they can't live up to the rest of this soaring, scathing, heartbroken and hopeful effort from Placebo. For me, the album really starts with track 4, For What It's Worth. If you're having a hard time loving this Placebo release, try listening to it from track 4 onward, and then backtracking to tracks 1 through 3. They really should have ended the album with the title song anyway. That's my read. And don't get me wrong. I mostly kinda really love this album. Like their best work, or life's best experiences, it's fun, it's funny, and it hurts a little. Or a lot. In a good way, though.
B004SBX112|5.0|Where is the Easter update at? paid for ad free. Timely updates would be appreciated. Playing what same levels over and over gets old. I'm sure we all want an update

B004HEXSLI|4.0|This is a very fascinating account of life before, during, and after a major stroke. It gives a lot of great insights into how to approach after-stroke care. I really wish I'd had it while caring for my mother, who suffered from several small strokes. I would recommend this highly to anyone who is caring for someone with a brain injury. There were parts that were repetitive, but overall a good read.
B00284BMBM|5.0|This is an awesome cd. Not only are the lyrics great, but the vocals and much more. They are an awesome band, and this is truly their best album.<br /><br />You Dont Belong is a great way to start off the album. It is a upbeat, nice tune and a good song to sing along with.<br /><br />No Surprise- Good first single from the album. Well known awesome song.<br /><br />Everytime You Turn Around- Just another great song to do some crazy awesome headbanging to. A nice, awesome sounding song.<br /><br />Life After You- Good, slower song. It's also great that they chose it for their second single. Impressing song.<br /><br />What I Meant To Say- Has cool notes and music throughout the whole song.<br /><br />Open Up Your Eyes- Really great song. The thing I like about the song is that you could imagine yourself, and just open up your eyes.<br /><br />September- Really awesome, nice slower song. Great single for Daughtry to chose, and really impressing song just like the whole album. Personally one of my fav songs off of the album.<br /><br />Ghost Of Me- Personally my favorite song off of the album. I love the way that the song sounds, and the lyrics. A great more fast song.<br /><br />Learn My Lesson- The lyrics are what make this song mainly outstanding. What more can I say?<br /><br />Supernatural- This is my 2nd favorite song off of this 5/5 star rated album. Really awesome song.<br /><br />Tennessee Line- Great song. Vince Gill....hmm..lets not get into that. But I love Daughtry's vocals throughout the whole song. Good slow song.<br /><br />Call Your Name- I love the way that the song starts off acoustic and slow, and then it becomes more rock towards the end of the song. Great song to end the album.<br /><br />Well, I guess that's it. But this an amazing album. And this is really impressing. What more can I say? 5/5!
B00466HN68|4.0|Other reviewers have given enough description of the movie and the story line. So, i will not repeat. However, this is not another \\"Ground Hog Day\\". The concept has been familiar to sci-fi fans for at least seventy years: A combination of alternate universes, time travel and brain power. It has also been used before in other films but never as well as this.<br /><br /> The story and the idea are exquisitely worked. The direction is good. The sets and some of the acting are also very good. I was not happy with the command post. It was too common place and low scale. It lacked too much of the importance of the mission, and the actors were too ordinary.<br /><br />I did not like the boy meets girl sub-story either. It just did not gel and took away from the main line. Father-son was good. Humanity of the main character was excellent. Chicago was a good choice.<br /><br />My father in law, at age 84,  who has hardly ever enjoyed anything but battle films, loved it and and was riveted to his seat throughout the showing, and did not require any explanation of the plot.<br /><br />It was also great to find out what you can get for $126, even in a world of 2011.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|Even as complete banal schlock, the film could have been vastly improved would that Mel Brooks produced, wrote, directed, and also starred in it. Were that done, the fact that none of the principals seem to have attended any acting school would not matter quite so much. But, admittedly, one's heart had to go out to the maudlin Ms. Portman when she tried to efface \\"WHORE\\" from the mirror without even as much as a little spritz of WINDEX (tm) ! If only that once. Then too, Ms. Portman's ubiquitous grimaces could probably have been substantially relieved simply by adding more fibre to her diet.<br /><br />P.S. The only thing I really liked was the dance sequence \\"doubling\\" for Ms. Portman, likely being done by the same person who plays \\"Jake Harper\\" in TwoAndAHalfMen. What an improvement ! Because, in fact, almost all the solo \\"ballet\\" action fell more than quite a bit short of \\"Jake's\\" artistry. Good thing I'd not eaten for about 10 hours. And I had to put a Bolshoi DVD on for several runs-through to reassure myself that GENUINE ballet was still extant.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Wow, big let down, lots of words, little action of interest, lost the thread of who I thought were the main characters....should have focused the story to ready us for the final installment, but instead, diluted the story to the point where I don't see how it can now be concluded to our satisfaction.
B000F48D3C|5.0|Based on the book written by Mark Bowden, Black Hawk Down potrays the story of the US Rangers and Delta Force entering the hostile city of Mogadishu of Somlia. I read the book and was dissapointed that some parts never made it into the film nor the extended cut. The extended cut included many 20-30 second clips that never made it into the big screen. Adding all of the eddited clips together i would estimate that the movie has been exteneded by 8-10 minutes.<br /><br />I personally purchased the extended cut after watching the movie many times from my DVR. I couldnt have enough and  had to watch more action. Included in the DVD is a special BBC report on the raid on Somlia; Contains many good facts about what occured in 1993 and the US Ranger Tactics and Battle Plan to take down the hostile war lords.<br /><br />If you have not seen Black Hawk Down or cannot get enough of it i would highly recommend Black hawk Down Extended Cut for you!
030745455X|3.0|I liked this book and the ending leaves you jumping directly into The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. But it seemed to me like there were too many other stories taking place that had nothing to do with the main plot. The book starts with Lisbeth being at a resort and her obsession with a doctor and his wife who are vacationing at the same resort. Her observation of this doctor and his behavior keeps you interested. However, that story is short lived, Lisbeth ends her travel, goes back to the real world and that is where the real story takes off. There is never any mention of the doctor and his wife after Lisbeth returns to Sweden. What ever happened to her friend George Bland? Why were these characters ever introduced? There also seemed to be way too many characters. There were also characters whose names were similar: Erica, Erikson and Ekstrom. For a while, I thought we were going to learn more aobut Officer Modig. There was a little mention of her personal life, then her role came to a halt. I noticed the same in The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. In that book, it seemed like the book took an intermission mid-way through and all of a sudden, I was reading a new book about Erica Berger and her position at SMP and her stalker. That was resolved, then it went back to Lisbeth's saga. What in the world was the point of Berger's storyline? I did like all the books and I assumed they were supposed to be about Lisabeth Salander. I just didn't understand why the books were so long, full of insignificant stories.

In perhaps his best work yet, Moore examines the United States' need for greed and the result is his most daring piece of work to date.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been reading the Bible my whole life and this app is absolutely amazing. I can't put the Word of God down. This app has everything from Bible studies to many different versions of the Bible. KJV red letter edition. This app reads the Bible aloud, saves your place, and offer a search of word or book. It is amazing that this app is free!!! I have shown this app to others and people have actually turned their life over to Christ because they could find a translation that they could understand. Also, I love that you can also log in to the website and pick up where you left off!! Phone, computer, and tablet, I'm at a loss for words!! A true Blessing....The only thing I would change is when you pick a reading plain, it could store all scriptures that you have covered so you can track how much of the Bible you have read. However, if you bookmark passages, you can track it anyway. I love this app. If there were no other apps on the market period, (besides Kindle and Nook), I would still have a tablet just for this app alone. Just that good.

B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I think this book is the best book I`ve ever read in my life.Better than Harry Potter, actually. This book is basically about two twins who have silver and gold auras, the twins of the legend. Aparrently, the twins are the only ones that can save the world from the Dark Elders. When the book gets stolen by John Dee, it's up to Scathatch, Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel, and Sophie and Josh to stop his evil ways. I gave this book to my three friends and they loved it!!!!!!!!
B004SBX112|1.0|Not only does amazon NOT have the update, but the customer service rep told me they DID have the update, but in order to get it I had to uninstall and reinstall seasons.  I did that, all my previous gameplay was lost, and of course, amazon doesn't actually have the update.  Second rep barely apologized for the first, said she shouldn't have told me that (duh) and blamed rovio.  Last purchase I every make from amazon app store and I hope rovio figures out that they are a disaster.

I like that Guy gives readers every trick and good idea that he knows from how to make a great impression, and how to get customers behind your cause, and even how to resist enchantment. He says that enchantment is a process, not an event. It's all about nurturing the long-term relationship that will create repeat business.  I love the amount of research that is behind this book.  It's not just a bunch of war stories. There's real science in here. If you follow his roadmap your business will be better for it.  Grab this book today. I loved reading it.<br /><br />Melinda F.

B000002UA5|3.0|The live tracks here make this album indispensable, especially for the excellent post-Syd Barrett rendition of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and the definitive version of \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene.\\" Roger Waters' screams will give you chills on that one. However, the studio album is just terrible, and won't ever be listened to by all but the most hardcore of hardcore fans. Yes, I know they were \\"experimenting,\\" but that doesn't excuse the drivel that resulted from it. The only track that comes even close to being listenable is Waters' \\"Grantchester Meadows,\\" a nice, but forgettable, little acoustic tune that serves better for testing out headphones than any other purpose. Waters' other contribution, \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict,\\" is even worse than its ridiculous title. Seriously, what was he smoking? This is not the same Waters that wrote lyrical masterpieces such as \\"The Wall,\\" \\"The Final Cut,\\" and \\"Amused to Death\\" years later.  David Gilmour's contribution, \\"The Narrow Way,\\" is bland, boring, forgettable, dreadful nonsense that wouldn't be topped in terribleness until \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" Wright and Mason's instrumental pieces drag on forever and don't go anywhere, boring the listener to tears. This is truly the worst pre-\\"Momentary Lapse\\" Floyd studio album, if you ask me. Thankfully, the live album salvages the set from complete uselessness, but even it is incomplete and several bootlegs from this era, not to mention the \\"Live at Pompeii\\" film, are better representative of early live Floyd, which was truly great. This album is a prime example of just how different the two bands - Live Floyd and Studio Floyd - were. The live band was exciting, energetic, manic, and powerful, in a time when Pink Floyd were still a unit, the members could tolerate each other, and they actually enjoyed playing live. The studio band, on the other hand, drifted seemingly endlessly into a series of dull, mediocre albums that can only be appreciated on large amounts of \\"medical enhancement.\\" The band simply lost its spark in the studio after Syd Barrett left, and they wouldn't regain it until \\"Meddle,\\" only to explode into a completely different, legendary band one album later with \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" \\"Ummagumma,\\" if nothing else, serves as a perfect document of everything the band Pink Floyd was between those two defining moments, for better or for worse.
B001SC9G5O|1.0|The author mentions that he refused to accept his editor's recommendations for the second edition of the book which is unfortunate.  His writing style is similar to a drunkard's walk, weaving around and around, occassionally making a cogent point and then starts wandering around again.    The book title does describe his writing style very well.
B0025X4P56|5.0|I'm not a stranger to the Eels. They come up frequently on my Pandora, and I've downloaded a few tracks in the past. I'm aware of E, and his whole spiel. He's a very entertaining musician who isn't afraid to get really raw. E goes beyond raw in this album, which features his lupine alter ego. Easily the best tracks on this are the faster and more up-tempo ones, such as \\"Fresh Blood\\" (probably the stand-out track on the album). This album sometimes comes down to the crunch of blues-rock in certain spots, although it never seems derivative. All in all a great album to own, and I highly recommend it.

I both own and have listened to this album on vinyl (yes, the original vinyl, not any of the newer pressings), so I know what this album is supposed to sound like; I'm not complaining about the remastering. This is, quite simply, one of the best psychedelic rock albums every made. Everyone who loves music should have a copy of it stashed somewhere.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|The Harry Potter series of books are the best I have ever read.  At times I am disappointed when some of the film adaptations delete sections, compress, or alter the books; although most are good movies in their own right.  Deathly Hallows part I does a good job translating the first 2/3 of the book and I would say the movie is about 75% accurate and captures the essence of the book.  There are parts that are very well brought to life, particularly the part where Harry sees the Patronus that leads him to the sword of Gryffindor, the return of Ron, and the destruction of the locket Horcrux.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rubert Grint, and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) have really grown into their roles - when I see them, I see their book counterparts.  The movies do tend to downplay Harry's temper and diminish his frequent use of the invisibility cloak in the books (one of the Deathly Hallows), but it has been fun watching the actors grow up and the filmmaking team as a whole has made a very deliberate effort to stay true to J.K. Rowling's vision.   Deathly Hallows part I has really nice cinematography and sets the stage well for the finale.  Highly recommended - but always read the book first to get the full story, and enjoy the movie to see most things come to life.
B004UOCF3W|3.0|The song writing is forgettable - not great, not bad - just nothing that I would recommend or listen to that frequently. But the SOUND...the recording of the album was hyped-up all over the place by Dave Grohl and Butch Vig for being recorded in Dave's garage using all classic analog equipment. And I'm a former Audio Engineer, so I was really excited to hear this record. But it fell pray to the technique known as \\"brick wall\\" compression/limiting/mastering. This technique attempts to make the music louder, more exciting, and more in-your-face. But it is so easy to use too much, and the result is a sound that is horribly distorted and squished. Probably the worst example of brick wall compression is Metallica's Death Magnetic. But Wasting Light sounds pretty bad. And I've listened to the album twice so far and I can't remember 1 lyric, hook, or riff. Oh well.
B003JCZLRS|2.0|This is why:    1. Long-winded minute descriptions of riggings and masts and everything nautical that really slowed down the narrative and the story.     I found myself leafing through tens of pages. It was great to watch the ship in the movie, not so interesting getting a forced education in every little part that made a ship. This book could have been half as long and twice as gripping.     2. The action sequences were rushed, with very little buildup and a whiplash conclusion.     Usually, after tens of pages in which nothing happens, suddenly there's a battle (without anyone preparing us for the excitement) and then it was over. I did recognize the tactics portrayed in the movie, except that in the movie the build-up was perfect, we understood the brilliance of Jack as a captain and really felt like we were a part of the ordeal.In the book the battles fell flat.    3. The author doesn't show us the personal relationships, but rather tells us about them by way of journal segments (personal diaries).    All in all, the writing is VERY old-fashioned, heavy, misses the punch-line, etc. You get the story - and, having watched the movie, you know it could be great - but alas the book isn't. Not for a 21st century reader.
B0002XMF5I|5.0|Black Sabbath's eleventh studio album Born Again was released in September of 1983.<br />The album was the first album following the abrupt departure of the late Ronnie James Dio (their singer who replaced Ozzy Osbourne) and drummer Vinny Appice who both left to form Dio whilst mixing the 1982 double live album Live Evil.<br />After the departures of Dio and Appice, original members guitarist Tony Iommi and bass player Geezer Butler got back temporarily drummer Bill Ward (who had gotten over his drug and alcohol addiction) and got Deep Purple veteran Ian Gillan to record an album which has been both cheered and jeered by Sabbath fans and/or critics. Was the album a masterwork or was it garbage, read on and find out (as I did when I first bought the album on cassette (Warner Bros issue) in June of 1994 at the behest of my best friend Dennis' father (who liked both Sabbath and Purple) and subsequently on remastered CD).<br />We open the album strongly with the thundering first single \\"Trashed\\" which sounds somewhat of a cross between \\"Neon Knights\\" and \\"Paranoid\\" with Ian's classic screams at the beginning and end of the track. Ian's voice singing, howling and screaming all works well on this track and Iommi's solos just come out smoking here. We follow with the first of two eerie instrumentals called \\"Stonehenge\\" which acts as an intro to the sinister, off-beat, mid-tempo \\"Disturbing the Priest\\". Butler's pounding bass and Iommi's riffs blend with Nicholls' dark synthesizers superbly and Ian's voice goes from singing to screaming and his sinister laughing. With its obvious religious theme, \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" is probably the most typical Sabbath-like song on the album lyrically speaking and how high Gillan can scream is amazing, especially his evil laugh at the end of the track. \\"The Dark\\" follows and is another instrumental interlude which segues into the Sabbath classic \\"Zero the Hero\\", which has a classic Iommi riff which was inadvertently borrowed by Guns N' Roses for Paradise City and this track was one of two tracks where Ian did not scream and Iommi's solo on this track is haunting.<br />The almost-anthem-like \\"Digital B**ch\\" kicks the second half off and picks up the pace that was on Trashed and was a great rocker and Iommi's solos on this track and Gillan's vocals just were amazing. The epic title track track to Born Again is next and is a dark and harrowing number featuring Iommi at his bluesiest on the track and Ian's vocal range goes from low to high back down and has some screaming. We then rock out again with \\"Hot Line\\" which reminds some of Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water and is a great rocker. Iommi's playing and especially solos on this track rock and Ian sings and screams throughout the song. The melodic, hard-rocking \\"Keep it Warm\\" closes the album on a slowish note but a great song. Ian doesn't scream here and Iommi as always served up a tasty solo on this track.<br />Born Again hit #4 on the UK album chart and cracked the US Top 40 and did fairly reasonable though critics panned the album. This album is a must and was Sabbath's last real album until 1992's Dehumanizer.<br />In 2011, Sanctuary/Universal Europe re-released the album in a Deluxe Edition. The first CD is the album remastered as properly as one should. Then the second disc consists of \\"The Fallen\\" which is a song that was recorded for the album but scrapped. Then we have an extended version of the instrumental \\"Stonehenge\\". The rest of the disc is the band's famed performance at The Reading Festival recorded by the BBC. Ian, Tony, Geezer and ELO drummer Bev Bevan plow through songs from Born Again (\\"Hot Line\\", \\"The Dark\\"/\\"Zero the Hero\\" and \\"Digital B*tch\\") plus the classics (\\"War Pigs\\", \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Paranoid (with teaser of \\"Heaven and Hell\\")\\") all done superbly I may add. Plus you get a comprehensive booklet which has original lyrics, artwork and essay on the making of the album.<br />Recommended!Paradise City and this track was one of two tracks where Ian did not scream and Iommi's solo on this track is haunting.

6304712944|2.0|Growing up, I loved this movie, and I had looked for it ever since. What a disappointment!     The songs didn't end.    The characters were caricaturely naive.     I enjoyed watching Richard Harris, but I liked him better in later films.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Simply beautiful!  This is a nice transition from one generation to the next.  Shows a great comparison of the advancements in the computer/digital world and brings it up to date.   The story line is well conceived and makes you want more.       For an analogy:  Watching the old movie and transitioning to the new is like looking at Windows 3.1 and comparing it to Windows 7 64 bit.  Each has its needs and were revolutions in their time but now have been perfected and polished.    Great to watch as blue ray as you don't want the highest quality so as not to detract from the story.

Not liking what becomes of the dead tributes at all... not sure the book will hold up if what's being suggested is actually true.<br /><br />Okay, that being said, it's really my only serious criticism of the book worth mentioning. I very much enjoyed the story and the suspense throughout.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Les Mis is one of the best operas written in the last 50 years.    No one calls it an opera.  But it is almost completely sung, seldom spoken.  Doesn't this make it an opera??  Oh, we don't want to scare people away.  This production is sung in front of mikes at the front of the stage.  The actor/actresses are in costume.  But they don't act out whole scenes.  Fantastic, large orchestra.  Great, large chorus.  The principle actors/singers are all opera quality except Marius, who is a popular rock star, young, handsome, curly black hair.  Very much looks like a young student.  For the battle scene at the barricades the huge light booms drop down, their lights turning up and down, flashing.  It is a very hellish, effective pandemonium.  Great.  At the end all 4 of the popular JeanVal Jeans sing together, or against each other.  Memorable.  I saw this on TV, then immediately ordered the DVD.  Thanks.  Incidently, I called the Cameron Macintosh organization.   They said they have no more performances scheduled in the near future for either Les Mis or for Martin Guerre anywhere in the US.  I saw the latter twice in Minneapolis and sent my relatives in LA and Seattle tickets.  They saw it.  Then for some reason it was withdrawn and never made its opening on Broadway.  Pity, it was very good.  Boublil and Schonberg: do you have any more great shows coming from your pens????

B00466HN68|5.0|The Review:<br /><br />Source Code came out of nowhere this April to temporarily snag the sci-fi spotlight from soon to be released blockbusters like Thor, Captain America and Green Lantern.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Capt. Colter Stevens who has been tasked with traveling back in time to ascertain the cause of an explosion of a commuter train headed for Chicago.  Unfortunately, Capt. Stevens only has a mere eight minutes each time he makes the time jump due to the severe constraints of time travel.  Failure means game over in a very explosive way, but Capt. Stevens has a lot of do overs, that is unless the train explosion is only the first of several attacks.<br /><br />Source Code's influences are Quantum Leap, 24 and Groundhog's Day. It borrows some of the best elements of those series and movie and adds its own spin to great effect.  Thankfully the screen writers did a wonderful job of finessing the details of time travel by more or less NOT delving into extraneous details of how it works.  Let's just say it has something to do with quantum mechanics and parabolic calculus.  Basically you'd need a PhD or two to understand it, so like Capt. Stevens you just need to accept it and stay on mission.  While this is a bit of cop out consider that most films that center around time travel usually end up with unresolved, maddening paradoxes -- be it the ridiculous Timecop or the mostly sublime Terminator series. Source Code avoids this problem by dispensing with a drawn out explanation of what are essentially arbitrary rules to tell a great story.<br /><br />Source Code is engaging from beginning to end.  It tells two parallel stories of Capt. Stevens' adventure in the past and his similarly complicated present.  You'll need to keep your thinking cap on tight as the implications of Capt. Stevens attempts to solve the mystery of the exploding train become more apparent.  It's a rare movie that can delve into the nature of realty, time and space while being one of the best action-thrillers of 2011.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.
B000OBYLVO|1.0|I sometimes enjoy watching silly romantic comedies but it was not the case with this movie, it was actually bad and embarrassing to watch. Great cast, awful writing
B0019OP0GU|5.0|This is a wonderful story and it is wonderfully done. Each character gives life to their part and in turn enables the other characters to show forth what the author was seeking to reveal in this heart warming film. It therefore became to me a must have movie and I will enjoy it many more times.  T.N. Craig

B002ZG99TA|4.0|So I really liked this movie. The acting was great but I felt there could be a little more action and suspense!! I thought the main part of the movie was getting the children safe so the trains do not hit.  That part was only 5 minutes.  Kind of disappointing.  I felt that more trains could be blowing up and people getting hurt/saved.  I needed a little more action.  Other than that, I would recommend watching the movie (and buying it used on Amazon).  It's a fun watch! :)
B00005K3O4|5.0|I remember this movie from so many years ago.  I really enjoy this movie...an odd and funny movie.  I'm not big on clowns, but this movie is an exception.  You should definitely buy this!
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I was very disappointed with this movie, not because of Miley Cyrus' acting (surprisingly), but because it was SO DIFFERENT from the book!  Cyrus' acting was actually good! A lot better than I thought it would be.  I am only disappointed with this movie because it left out all of the important parts of the book! If you read the book before watching the movie, you will have the same opinion as I do.  While the book left me crying, the movie left me mad.  I suggest reading the book and NOT WATCHING the movie.
B004B32500|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Great storyline...at one point though I knew what was going on, then was hit with a curve ball!  Must watch this movie!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I bought the book on a whim. Until I started reading it I was afraid that I had wasted my five bucks. Great myths and genres always have a higher than normal chance of being bastardized. Zombies, vampires and the like are creatures with a deep mythos about them and that mythos has been abused again and again in film and literature. So, yeah, I was worried I had wasted five bucks.<br /><br />The book is written as a historical account of a world-wide zombie outbreak and the war that followed. The narrator travels the world after the war ends, collecting stories from different survivors, gathering a wide view of what the war was like for people in different stations and nations and cultures.<br /><br />It was a good read. Gritty and realistic but not overtly depressing, as a world-wide zombie invasion would be. My only struggle was the complete lack of any real protagonist to fall in love with. But the originality of the storytelling made up for it with me. It was a risky book to write, I think, being so very different. But it was a risk that paid off. Five bucks well spent.
B00308YN2U|2.0|Beware when buying this product!  I bought it specifically for the digital copy.  What the product description does not tell you is that the code used to redeem or download your digital copy expired in 2010!

B003P2WO5E|4.0|Even without his contribution to The Wheel of Time, Brandon Sanderson is a valuable voice in the realm of fantasy. The Way of Kings, the first book in The Stormlight Archive, is his first shot at something with a scope as large as The Wheel of Time or A Song of Ice and Fire. I was a little wary as I picked it up.<br /><br />I shouldn't have been.<br /><br />Like all of his books, the magic system is delicately defined and clever. But unlike books like Mistborn, the world is huge. I was worried about that only because when you read something with so many PoV characters you tend to love some and hate others. That's what we all found with the Wheel of Time, right? (Oh no, not another Elayne chapter!) But with The Way of Kings I was surprised to see that I wanted to know what was happening with every character.<br /><br />I enjoy how Sanderson is never afraid of pitting philosophies against each other in his works. Just like in Mistborn he examines concepts of sin vs purity, atheism vs religion and mortality vs ascendancy. And he does it all in ways that do not seem trite or preachy.<br /><br />The Way of Kings tells the tale of a world at war from the point of view of warring surgeons, thieving scholars and mournful killers. The plot is deep and intricate. The characters are living and lovable. The cultures are many and true. I'm excited to see where this series will go. Pick it up. You won't regret it.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|I love to shop on Amazon but this product was a complete waste of money and is too costly to return if damaged.  The product came with multiple holes from the packing/manufacturing.  It looks great, if you can find all the holes in it to use it.  I patched this thing six times and still no luck...its leaking air and water.  Complete manufacture defect.  I ignored those reviewers who posted similar reviews and now I've wasted $50.00 bucks.  It will be thrown away before my son ever got to place his feet in it.
B000FC13MM|4.0|I didn't find out this was technically a young adult novel until after I finished it. And I'm glad of that. Sometimes the labels people put on a book taint it before you get a chance to read it.<br /><br />Sabriel is a fantasy about the daughter of an undead-slaying necromancer. Raised in a setting that feels like 20th-century earth, she is forced to leave school behind and seek her father deep within the Old Kingdom, a place rich with danger, magic and undead nasty thingies. Sabriel is full of great settings and intrigue. The most attractive part for me was the depth of the world and magics that made it.<br /><br />The world is divided into two places. Ancelstierre, which is similar to earth a hundred years ago, and the Old Kingdom. They are separated by a great wall which holds back the undead yuckies and magics that try to pour down from the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />The story was great. The plot was completely driven by the characters and deep. The writing, however, was a little clunky now and then, and that tend to be distracting. Also, the story was told strictly from the point of view of Sabriel herself. Usually I resonate with a book better when there are multiple views points to distract me. But I think that's more of a failing with me than it is with the book. It's the first in a series, and I still haven't decided if I'm going to plunge ahead and get the rest of them. But if you like fantasy and teen novels and deeper-than-usual-coming-of-age tales, give Sabriel a whirl.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This concert by the Eagles was one of the best concerts I've seen on DVD...and I've seen many.  These old guys never lost their touch.  They perform their \\"oldies\\" with such precision that it fans the flames of love & passion.  They also perform with an excellent guitar player who compliments their style to a tee.  Although he's not one of the original members, he sure stood out.  The Eagles Fly High Once Again!
B002ZG976U|3.0|I wonder why in 2011 we're here to spend our eight bucks at movies and see a musical rooted in silent melodrama where Cher must save her failing nightclub from a villianous developer that wants to repossess it and tear it down. All he needed was a black top hat, cane, and mustache to put us back a century where we could watch Mary Pickford play Christina Aguilera's part.  But those folks really had writers working on the word titles-- they could think of a more realistic love story than where Ali (Christina Aguilera) finally falls in love with Jack and after their night together, she can only say, \\"I'm so glad you're not gay.\\" I also was turned off by the double standard. No put downs were delivered about women who might be gay. Cher and Christina were a love story waiting to happen themselves. Aguilera's acting has not matured any since she was in The New Mickey Mouse Club.
B00092ZL80|3.0|I like Chicago...and I like Earth Wind & Fire...but this performance left me disappointed in both.  Music quality fell short.  I liked the brass, but the transition was rough between numbers.  I guess I expected more.
B004SBX112|5.0|The game itself is great, but the fact that the updates aren't nearly as frequent or timely as the Android App Store is total B.S. It's like this for more than just this app too. Fix this soon.

0316069353|3.0|If, like me, you're a die-hard Connelly fan and have already bought the book.....hang in there until about the last 50 pages where the plot takes hold. Up until that point it drags with a capital \\"D\\" (page after page of courtroom testimony that adds little to the story). There's a preview of the next Harry Bosch novel (due out Oct. '11) at the end of the book, it looks to be really good if the preview's any indication.
1400052173|3.0|The topic is very interesting but at times hard to follow because it really bounces around and a lot of the terms and science are hard to follow and keep straight. I never ended up finishing the book and I really tried.  The actual story was very interesting and informative - I think the author just tried to cover too much material and scientific data and it became a bit dry.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The only thing about this book that did not disappoint me is that it's not just me; a lot of people feel let down.  It's almost as if the author handed this one over to an inexperienced ghostwriter thinking we wouldn't be able to tell the difference.    I gave it two stars instead of one because there is a part of me that wonders if my opinion of this book is affected by my feelings about the first two books. Saying I loved them is an understatement.     I miss Katniss so much - the Katniss from the first two books, not this one.    Addendum:  After much discussion with friends, I've decided that I'm happy I didn't like this final book in the series. It made it easy to go on to something else. If I hadn't read the this one, I would still be reeling from the second one and not at all interested in reading anything else for quite a while.
B004SBX112|4.0|Glad to see the easter update finally make it to the amazon appstore, even though the update has already been up on the android market free version. Here's hoping Rovio and Amazon get the next update out more promptly!
B0018OFN1S|4.0|Rewatching the first 4 Fast movies to get ready for Fast5. Hard to believe the first one was from 2001 but overall it has aged well for being 10 years old.  I snickered when they were stealing TV/VCR combos, and plot is they are stealing DVD players.  My 15 yr old son saw it for the first time and liked it.
B00005V9IL|5.0|The Abyss is a fantastic visual feast.  The special edition DVD is one of the best that I have ever seen.  Now, just imagine what it would be like on Blu-Ray?  How about it Mr. Cameron??
B004SBX112|3.0|finally can play ad-free at long last! but I am docking two stars due to the fact that everyone else around me is already playing the Easter levels, but I haven't received an update yet! what gives?!
B00008PX8P|4.0|..I was hoping Page would've thrown the Whole Lotta Love promo video (Beat Club - Musikladen), and the Whiskey a-GoGo performances (1969) into this collection.<br /><br />Also, the Physical Graffiti/Presence era is sadly missing for the most part (save for In My Time of Dying/Trampled Underfoot from Earls Court (1975), and Achilles Last Stand/Nobody's Fault but Mine/Sick Again from Knebworth (1979)).  It would've been cool, if Page/Carruthers would've included the infamous 7/23/77 Day on the Green concert..<br /><br />..but, given the collection here, I enjoyed it (save for the overdone motion cam in a few segments). One actually gets to experience Led Zeppelin live, right up until the untimely demise of John Bonham..
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought the Supertooth Buddy for my Mother in law, as I needed something easy to set up, and operate without too many bells and whistles, and the Supertooth Buddy is it! Personally I am getting tired of the technical \\"arms race\\" with electronic devices. The Buddy does it's job well without having to jump through hoops. I read the manual, explained it to my wife, and she set it up for her Mother, no problems! To me that is the true test, as my wife isn't a gear head. If she can set it up, and my Mother in law can work it, then it passes the test. It is plenty loud enough for conversations, and the magnetic visor clip allows the Buddy to be swapped from one side of the visor to the other in an instant if one needs to change the visor position. A great bluetooth device for those of us who just want something simple that works. It comes with a car charger and USB to Mini USB cable to charge the unit. It does not come with a home charger, though one can use the USB cable to charge it using your USB port on your computer. Standby time is 1000 hours, so the lack of a home charger shouldn't be an issue.
0316010669|4.0|Good read, not a dull moment. Covers lots of related and interesting topics such as snap judgement, thin-slicing, the right and wrong and mind-reading, etc.  Perfect summer read.  No deep thinking is required here but it does make you ponder more about our everyday's thinking.  Recommended!     Just happened to read an article today about Malcolm's other office, Savoy in SoHo, where he wrote a big chunk of this book there.     [...]    I cannot help but to think that from the restaurant windows where he could see people on the street walking by ... what a environment it was for him to write a book about people.  How he might have witnessed the bystanders using snap judgement and thin-slicing while he is working on the very same material.
0061726826|5.0|While I felt this book was slow going when it did pickup it grabbed me hard and pulled. We meet Lena who has had anything but a normal childhood. Her father has died and her mother committed suicide and Lena is waiting her time for the surgery that will end the sickness in her known as love. Lena spends time with her best friend Hana running all over town. Then she meets Alex who pushes what she knows and in a sense wakes her up from her dream state.  She learns that what the Government was about was primarily based on lies.  Who wants a life without love?  Lena does alot of internal thinking about the what if's in life.  I enjoyed this and found humor in the beginning chapters when describing Deliria and it's side affects.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I had gone through many dock ports/cables from ebay and then caved in and purchased this puppy.  I got the refurb for less money directly from cablejive.  It transmits audio and video signals to the Iphone dock, for play back on my hometheater.<br /><br />I also have a iphone 4 with a vapor element case.  I had to file down the port a little to get it to fit.  The stock sizing is too big for the element case.  The dock works like it should.  I recommend this!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Face in the sand is seriously one of their best and of my Favorite Iron Maiden songs now.   They're talent screams out in this one. It's very different than their normal songs and in fact pretty unique compared to all songs.    I one day had the idea of dubbing a chick's moaning into that song and came out with a fantastic result. I call it Face in the Moaning and just leave it playing repeatedly in the background of whatever I'm doing. I even put it on my cell phone as a ringtone, which was really cool until my phone started to ring one day when I was out with my parents.    Of course now that I'm writing this I don't know if I'll post it. Considering everything that going on all over the world. Too many people singing and thinking about the end of the world could be very bad.

0385523912|5.0|I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I have lived in South Korea for many years, and have always been intrigued by our neighbour to the north - but it took Barbara Demick's book to really bring home to me the human cost of the grotesque political and humanitarian disaster that is taking place there. This is an informative and very moving book, but most of all, it is very readable and very human. I found myself caring very deeply for the people who Demick introduces us to, and, almost by-the-by, learning more and more about the true cost of living in North Korea. A truly wonderful, moving book.
B003Y5H5KQ|5.0|4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />I liked this film. I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I like all of director Joe Wright's films. Each seems to be crafted by someone who is truly in love with the art of filmmaking. This would seem like a prerequisite for any film, but sadly, I don't believe it is. Beginning with his version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in 2005, through \\"Atonement\\", \\"The Soloist\\" and now \\"Hanna\\", he brings a unique sensibility to each, giving each film a different look, a different feel and a different style. While he makes each film unique, he also uses enough of the genre or theme to make it recognizable, allowing our vision of these stories to expand along with him. I mean, it would be pretty silly to watch a version of \\"Pride\\" that doesn't at least acknowledge the source material by Jane Austen. But Wright is smart enough to realize he can only push the envelope so far and shows some restraint.<br /><br />Hanna (Saoirse Ronan, \\"Atonement\\") has been raised in the forest by her father, Erik (Eric Bana). They spend their days and nights together in a small cabin living about as far off the grid as humanly possible. Erik spends his time training Hanna to survive; they engage in elaborate fights, hunt, learn to survive in the tundra, teaching Hanna to become strong, to fight against the best of them. Her skill set is amazing, wide and varied, but as a sixteen-year-old teenage girl, she begins to miss something in her life. As she asks questions, Erik begins to realize what she wants. One day, he digs up a small beacon he buried long ago and brings it back to the cabin. If Hanna really wants to see the real world, all she has to do is turn the beacon on. As soon as she does this, Marissa Vigler (Cate Blanchett), a CIA operative, will begin to hunt them. A couple of days later, Erik returns from a hunt to find the beacon blinking. They make arrangements to meet in Berlin and he is off. Hanna waits and soon, a helicopter arrives. She puts up token resistance and soon finds herself in a strange holding facility. She asks to speak with Marissa Vigler and all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />An interesting thing to note about this film is that the screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr (who wrote some episodes of the British TV series \\"MI: 5\\") was listed on both the 2006 and 2009 Blacklist, an annual list of the best-unproduced screenplays circulating in Hollywood. It is kind of easy to see why this screenplay was not immediately snapped up and produced. \\"Hanna\\" is a character-driven action film. Most action films are story-driven and directors embrace this because it gives them an excuse to blow up buildings and to choreograph elaborate action sequences. In \\"Hanna\\", the characters are the heart of the story, and we spend a lot of time with them, learning about them, watching them navigate this world. There are some terrific action set-pieces, but they aren't the main focus of the film. In fact, in a couple of these, the director seems to believe they aren't important to the characters and we watch only the aftermath of the fight before it. We'll return to this later. But I feel like story-driven action films are more popular, more acceptable for most filmmakers because they don't have to spend too much time on character development, they can concentrate their energy on elaborate explosions, kick-ass car chases and fancy fights.<br /><br />Joe Wright deserves a lot of credit for recognizing how well-written and how unique this story is and for sticking to the strange and unusual aspect of the screenplay.<br /><br />There are a lot of unusual touches to the visuals of this story. From the very beginning, when we first join Hanna and Erik in the snow-bound forest, everything appears almost monochromatic. They are living in a world blanketed with white and the wood and animal skins surrounding them provide dark, vibrant slashes of black and gray. Both Hanna and Erik are very pale, their wild hair frequently covered with snow. Even after Hanna is captured and taken to the holding facility, the images remain monochromatic. But now, everything is very gray (lots of concrete and metal) and orange (the surrounding desert and her prison garb, for lack of a better word). As the story moves to Morocco, then France, then Berlin, Hanna seems to find herself in dirty, unkempt areas. Especially when she gets to Berlin, the area she populates seems uncared for, nothing has been painted in a many years and seems faded of all vitality. It is an easier place to go unnoticed. This also helps to carry on with the washed out, monochromatic feel of the film.<br /><br />When Hanna is held in the unknown facility, it appears like it was originally constructed in the 70s, lots of curves and circular shapes, everything appears a little grimy. This gives us the message she is in a facility that hasn't been used in a while, and now seems to be dusting off the cobwebs. When she eventually escapes, Wright embraces the nature of the facility and really throws us into a different kind of action film. He creates a montage of incredibly brief shots and very quick editing to give us more of a feel of her escape. This sequence seems to pay homage to films of the 70s, borrowing the same sort of editing aesthetic Kubrik, Friedkin and Yates might have used. Lots of brief shots, lots of close-ups of shapes and images, blurry transitions, shots turning and twisting. In a way, this aesthetic also helps us remember that Hanna is new to this world and everything must seem strange and new to her.<br /><br />Because Wright is more interested in the characters, he spends a lot of time with Hanna and Erik, establishing who they are, what makes them interesting. There are moments of violence, of fighting, but these seem abbreviated somehow. As mentioned before, in many instances, we witness the aftermath of a fight or a violent episode. This does two things. First, it allows our mind to fill in the details of what happened just before. Generally, our minds will fill in more graphic details, more blood, so this is an effective technique to get us involved in the story. It is the same technique that makes a good horror film good. When we don't see everything in explicit detail, our mind fills in the blanks, making it scarier. Second, it reminds us the characters are king and in control of the story in this film.<br /><br />When we do see the action, it is top notch. Hanna's escape from the holding facility is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Various fist fights are elaborately choreographed and interesting. A gun battle is very quick and leaves your heart racing.<br /><br />But Wright is clearly more interested in character. After Hanna escapes the holding facility, she walks through the Moroccan desert and happens upon a British family traveling in an old caravan. Dad (Jason Flemyng) and Mom (Olivia Williams) are eager for their children, Sophie (Jessica Barden), a teenager trying to live beyond her years, and Miles (Aldo Maland), to live a rich life in the country, full of travel. When Hanna and Sophie meet, Sophie seems to consider this new, unusual friend a trophy and she wants her around for a while. This sequence of the film seems to diverge from the real story. Hanna basically lives with them for a while as they travel. And as this seems to go on forever, a realization happens. Hanna is learning how to be a, more of less, normal teenage girl from Sophie. It actually works and gives us a deeper feeling for Hanna.<br /><br />Also, during this sequence, Wright continues to revisit Erik, Marissa and a strange German assassin played by Tom Hollander, keeping us grounded  and making the sequence seem more integrated into Hanna and Erik's story.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is really good as Hanna. She is mature beyond her years but also naïve and lacking in the life experiences most of us have in their first sixteen years. Because of this, Hanna is unsure of most of what she is experiencing as soon as she enters the real world. But she knows Marissa is out to get her, so with every challenge she adapts quickly and moves on.<br /><br />Ronan shows us all of Hanna's vulnerabilities while demonstrating her unique skills. One moment, she may be staring wide-eyed at a television because it is the first one she has ever seen. The next, she is running through a maze of shipping containers trying to elude a trio of assassins. This duality runs throughout the film and helps us get a better picture of this very mature young lady who can kill people with her bare hands yet wonders what the world really holds for her.<br /><br />Eric Bana is good as Erik. He is a strange fellow and we wonder for quite a while why he has brought his daughter to this small cabin in the woods, to raise her in such extreme isolation. There are a couple of flashbacks giving us the back-story to his character and his relationship with Marissa. A highly efficient killer, he has confidence in his daughter's ability to survive.<br /><br />Blanchett plays Marissa Vigler, a CIA operative who is working for and towards her own agenda. As she tracks Hanna and Erik, we learn about their relationship and the reasons for her nearly psychotic determination. She really wants to get to Erik and Hanna and we get the sense that much of this is due to her personal relationship with them. She is holding a grudge or wants to clean up a mistake and will stop at nothing until she reaches her goals.<br /><br />Blanchett is great. Using a sort of Southern twang, you never, ever feel Marissa relaxes. Yes, she smiles and tries to be personable, but there always seems to be a tightly wound rubber band underneath, ready to snap.<br /><br />Wright quickly and efficiently convinces us of each character's determination to succeed, to beat their adversaries. This builds a lot of tension between the trio and helps to keep our attention riveted to the screen.<br /><br />\\"Hanna\\" is a real treat. A character-driven action film filled with interesting, unusual performances and a hybrid visual style.

0756404738|3.0|I read the first book last year.  It was a very nice beginning.  There was the usual small boy who had talent.  We watched him grow in an interesting environment.  Because of the storytelling framework (a recounting of the story) we get an idea that he at least made it through that part of his life.    There were a lot of interesting themes during the original story that weren't really explored during the second book.  I enjoyed reading this second book, but I had the nagging feeling that there is an awful lot that won't ever be resolved; or it gets resolved like a two-hour made-for-TV Hallmark movie when everything's wrapped up with five minutes left, after the last commercial.  :-)    A few examples; Kvothe spends time learning fighting skills and passes the skills test, yet, in the inn, when he pauses the story, he gets his butt kicked by some soldier thug.  Another; we really didn't get much expansion of the character Auri, who seems important.  We don't really learn much more of the Chandrain, which is one of the central forces in the story.  Nothing really about Jakis, although there's been ominous references to that character.    Of course, maybe a thousand page book has to have slow parts, but, with such a big story, I'd expect things to move along quite a bit more than I found in this book.

B002ZG997C|4.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. There was something evil about this movie, tho. Maybe that everyone is 'out for themselves'. I was able to think of another movie it reminded me of (that used an evil movie to sell a moral tale or a religious theme - perhaps they all do) but can't remember it's title. I don't think it's completely true, but another reviewer called The Book of Eli 'without humanity'. All I can think to say is that even the bible concedes the Earth as the devil's playground.<br /><br />There's the question of whether this happens to include religion in a good story, or whether the film makers are using the story to sell religion. Or using either or both only to make money. Perhaps it doesn't matter. I liked the movie. I would make a guess they're trying to sell religion.<br /><br />The most interesting thing in the film (and perhaps what it's centered on) is the notion that the bible can be used to control or pacify the masses. If you can't believe this, perhaps you wont like the movie? Perhaps it works because it's a negative (tho powerful) view of the bible, the way it's presented here in the movie. Regardless, it worked for me. I'm good at suspending my disbelief. When I think about it seriously, though, it wouldn't work. In some kind of post-apocalyptic world - maybe. In today's world, forget it. You'd need something that speaks to people today, written in the manner people talk nowadays. That's what you need.<br /><br />Now I could write such a book. Sure. Send a large enough advance and I'll do it. It wont even have to be all the money in the world.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Ive watched the season online (netflix), but the blue ray is awesome, no comparison!!! I would recommend this for anyone who likes Gladiator or has seen a few episodes on stars. Well worth the $$$ and is cheaper on amazon than any in-store purchase... by far!    Very happy!
B003EY7IRC|4.0|This series is amazing; the style of writing really gets the reader into the story and their imagination going; the story line is captivating and lastly, the twist at the end is completely unexpected.    Unfortunately, the only thing about this book is that the last one, Shadowfever is extremely long-winded and it takes a hell of a lot of back and forth between two characters until you get the final result.    Saying that, I would love for a second MacKayla novel/series, even just a one-off sequel affair, to detail what life is like after the Fever series. Perhaps that could be something Ms. Moning would dare to consider applying on paper.....

B004UOCF3W|5.0|An exceptional piece of work showing that the Foo Fighters are not fading, but aging well and getting better at their craft as they go.  This album has everything that made me love the band years ago.<br /><br />Stand out tracks for me are 'Bridge Burning', 'A Matter of Time' and what may be the greatest Grohl song ever (forgive me Everlong) 'Walk' though there is nothing less than an exceptional song on the whole thing.  Get the deluxe version, the extra song 'Better Off' is one you won't want to miss too.
B004132HZS|5.0|First episode is amazing, the second one not so much, the third episode is good. Yes unfortunately Season 1 only has three episodes.  Hopefully the BBC will be creating more seasons.  Great premise, great actors. Can't wait to see season 2!

B004CIIXFA|4.0|While I didn't respond quite as strongly to this as to Ms. Arnold's amazing first feature `Red Road',<br />this is still very strong film making. Unlike `Red Road', the subject has been covered before - a damaged,<br />angry neglected teenager, acting out against the world, getting in over her head sexually, behaving in ways that<br />even she would be hard pressed to explain. But if the general terrain is a familiar, the sense of rage and<br />power is one we rarely see given to a young female character, and - for the most part - there's a sense of raw<br />honesty and truth that eludes the vast majority of films about teens.<br /><br />Mild spoilers ahead.<br /><br />For every moment that the film flirts with clich&eacute; (e.g. the good boyfriend/bad boyfriend choice - more subtle than<br />usual here, but still a little too neat), there are others that are original, complex and unique. I just wish the<br />ending didn't feel like a forced hopeful note, that a few of the symbols along the way (e.g. the White Horse)<br />weren't so on the nose, and that Katie Jarvis, marvelous most of the time in the lead, but a non-pro, had a<br />couple more colors and nuances in her performance. But none of those drawbacks, while substantive, keep<br />this from being an important film by an important young filmmaker.
B004L49K20|5.0|I just read through about three pages of reviews and couldn't agree with everyone more.  I would argue though, that this is not only their best album ever, but the best album by anyone in a very LONG time!  There are exceptionally few albums you can listen to in their entirety without skipping a song, and this is one of those albums.  BELIEVE THE HYPE!  It's true Duran Duran is back and it's pure musical bliss!  Even the sequence of the songs is genius.  Much credit to the boys and producer Mark Ronson.  I wish I would've bought the album a couple days sooner and I would've gone to one of their recent shows in LA.  Hopefully they will tour more extensively in support of AYNIN, there are enough hit singles on here to maintain interest in live performances for a while.  My favorites are Girl Panic!, Mediterranea, Sorry You're So Beautiful, Runway Runaway, Being Followed, Leave a Light On, Before the Rain and Man Who Stole A Leopard.  Even the tracks not mentioned here would be the best tracks on anything they've put out since The Wedding Album.  If you haven't get this album and spread the word!  Duran Duran is back and just put out the best DAMN album in who knows how long!!!
B000LC3ICY|5.0|Great movie, I picked this item up for a very good price and was shipped to my door within 4 days; great shipping rate also. Very satisfied.
B004SBX112|1.0|I am highly upset about the Amazon app store not updating apps at the same time as the android market... if I had the free version it would have updated yesterday.
B004UIOUHC|2.0|I run both Flash and HTML 5 content on my web server. Loaded Opera onto my Xoom running HC 3.0.1. It will not display flash content (menus or players) properly. Reloaded Flash 10.2 just in case it was not working properly. Restarted Opera and it still will not display flash content. Tested HTML 5 content and it appears to display and function properly.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|Best iPhone case I have come across for the money.  Better quality than some of the others for a fraction of the price and fits great.  You won't be sorry.
B004SBX112|2.0|If Amazon wants people to keep faith in their store they need to be more timely with updates. The Android Market has the Easter update already so there is no excuse. I uninstalled and went back to free version, and I'm playing the Easter levels despite the ads.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Latest version as of 4/7/2014 - It keeps improving even if most improvements are aimed at making it easier to buy books from Amazon rather than read them. As before, forget working on older Android devices. 2013 advice on upgrading old phone to new versions remains the same. The two remaining deficiencies reported last time remain glaring examples of insensitivity to user needs: 1) There are many dictionaries that the Kindle app will read; but, other than Amazon's included dictionary which is mediocre, none will work WITH the Android Kindle app. There is simply no excuse for this. This feature was available on the first Palm-Pilot eReader app in 1996! I'm beginning to think the Kindle development team doesn't read. 2) There are still no text or background color choices other than black, white and sepia. Again, the reason for this remains unfathomable. The first color pda, the Palm IIIc, was introduced in 2000 and its eReader app allowed users to choose their own foreground and background colors. In an industry where a year is like a decade or more, the Android Kindle app remains in the ereader stone age, still behind the first color ereader! This would not be a big deal except for the fact that a lot of people read in bed before they go to sleep and it is well known that white light (particularly the blue component) seriously inhibits sleep. (See; e.g., [...]) This is not rocket science guys. Get a clue. Red, yellow or amber text on a black background would be a major improvement for those of us who like to read before sleeping and then get to sleep easily!    Revised 07/02/2013: Latest version as of 7/2/2013 crashes on Droid X Android ver. 2.3.3. This happened a couple of years ago and it took months for it to be fixed. Advice is don't upgrade until you can verify it will work.    Other than this, product has been improving steadily. Two other remaining deficiencies: 1) no ability to use a dictionary of your choice, even though Amazon sells other dictionaries; theone included for free, while okay, is simply inadequate: missing many common words. 2)There is really no excuse for the program to be limited to a black and white screen. This was okay when screens were only B&W, but how archaic is that today? Many who read at night prefer color combinations that are easier on their eyes and do not affect their night vision.    Revised 11/16/2011: The Android version of the Kindle app has gradually gotten better and better (current ver 3.2.0.35):    Usability features still lacking: 1) no commercial dictionary or thesaurus capability. 2) Highlight beyond a couple of words on a small screen unusable.    1) Search now works much faster on a 1 ghz Droid X.    2) There is now a real dictionary that is loaded locally. Its lookups are very quick. A vast improvement. The Kindle app, however, still needs the ability to add 3rd party dictionaries. Other eReaders have no issues with using better dictionaries; and, indeed, Amazon sells Kindle versions of some of these other dictionaries; e.g., Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.    3) The Kindle automatic cloud backup of user notes and bookmarks is a nice feature which is getting more reliable but it is still buggy. On occasion my bookmarks and notes for book I am currently reading have been wiped out. Not fatal, but irritating.    4) The Kindle Options choices of type font, type size, and foreground/background colors are too limited. The provided reading fonts and sizes are not a problem but a question of preference. On the other hand, foreground/background colors should be easy to enlarge: in some reading environments white, black or sepia just don't work.
0634022296|5.0|This a complete book of all the Beatles' songs with chords to play with your guitar.  It is perfect for me since I heard most of the songs before.  I used to play guitar in the 60's but I'm very rusty.  This book is great because I can get back on the groove practicing these songs.  I'm still waiting for my new Fender Stratocaster to arrive.  Can't wait to see how it will sound.  This is not a book for music readers, just like the cover says is a Chord Songbook.  I love it and for the price you can't beat it.  Recommend to all Beatles' fans out there.

B0038W0OIK|1.0|After reading some of the glowing reviews, I decided to give the Steelseries 7H a try.  Rather quickly, one thing became clear--one thing that I was amazed nobody else had mentioned.  Wearing these you must remain perfectly still.  Even the slightest brush against the braided cord causes a great rumbling in the left earpiece.  This problem was loud, frequent, and annoying enough that I would have returned it within a couple of days if I still had the box.  Instead, I decided to let it run its lifetime.    Surprise number two came yesterday when I learned that said lifetime was about a month and a half.  The sound now cuts out unless the cord is being held just right.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Oh my! What can I say. I love, love, love Lark Rise to Candleford. I love to watch british movies, but this is so enjoyable. I could not wait to see each season. My absolute favorite is Season 1 and 2. But the others are good too. I was so sorry that it did not continue. Hopefully, someone will make a movie. I strongly recommend this series. If you love comedy, romance, drama,some mystery and tears you will love this.
0345522478|5.0|I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I chose this book from the Amazon Vine program. I know that I liked the concept - a modern day Druid - and the fact that it was compared to Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series. I love the Harry Dresden books after all. But at the same time I really hate when one series is compared to another as the two in question rarely meet the exception. This wasn't the case with Kevin Hearne's Hounded which not only met all of my expectations but exceeded them.<br /><br />I read this book on the plane home from visiting my sister and often found myself chuckling aloud at things in the book. The main character of Atticus has just the right amount of sarcasm to keep things light even when there are demons and other beasties popping out all over the place. Not to mention a fun cast of supporting characters that I hope we see again and again in the next two books. Like Atticus's werewolf & vampire lawyers, his dog Oberon, his widowed neighbor and the various gods and goddesses that so love to make Atticus a pawn in their games. And the mythology...I couldn't get enough of it! I love Irish mythology, I always have, and Hearne does an amazing job with weaving in all you need to know of the old myths without bogging the story down with details. And its not just Irish Mythology that is used but there are myths and stories used from other religions/beliefs as well that really flesh out this world and make it tangible.<br /><br />Hearne also does a great job in making the reader believe that all these old gods and goddess are real and still walk among us. In some ways, The Iron Druid series is the Percy Jackson books of the adult world but with a bit more action, humor and fighting. As Hounded was the first in a series there is a lot of time spent on the world building and character introductions but mixed in with all that information is a well detailed plot that really sucks you in. The story is fast paced and there is very little time for you to sit back and breath because once Atticus overcomes one hurdle there are three more tossed in his way.<br /><br />I really can't tell you with enough words just how much I loved this book. Its a book that I know that I will reread over and over...as well as bully those around me to read. I think that there is just something in this story to appeal to any audience. I am also so glad that this is one series that is published back to back because I am finding it really hard to wait a month for the next installment and can't imagine the toll on my sanity if I had to wait a year or more to find out what happens next to our modern day Druid. I urge you all to go out and buy this book if you like the Percy Jackson books or the Dresden Files then this will be a book that you enjoy just as much if not more.eath because once Atticus overcomes one hurdle there are three more tossed in his way.

B004G600A4|5.0|\\"Tangled\\" is spectacular, but it's not because it's a 3D cgi movie. The fact is, Disney has regained its magic and they did it with some hand-drawn veterans. Kudos to John Lasseter for once again pushing story rather than technology. It's why Brad Bird's \\"Incredibles\\" for Pixar was so fantastic and now Lasseter has pushed Disney back on track with their 50th animated feature. I wish it had happened one movie sooner to prove traditional animation isn't dead. \\"Princess & the Frog\\" almost made it, but they just threw songs everywhere most of which could have been deleted. Anyway, back to \\"Tangled\\". Some of the artists that made \\"Tangled\\" so spectacular are Glen Keane, Donna Murphy, Alan Menken and Lisa Keene.  First, executive producer Glen Keane was the lead animator for Ariel, Beast, Aladdin and Pocahontas to name a few. He apprenticed under Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston and obviously their brilliance is now found in him. Donna Murphy is one of the strongest voices on Broadway. She was lead in Sondheim's \\"Passion\\" and anyone who knows Sondheim's rigorous selection process knows amateurs need not apply. As soon as I heard Murphy's voice in \\"Tangled\\" I recognized it immediately and knew Disney had struck gold there. Alan Menken returns for scoring the music and although Slater his lyricist is no Howard Ashman yet, most of the songs are very solid. There's also Lisa Keene who I'd have to say is Disney's modern day Mary Blair/Eyvind Earle. Like Glen Keane, Lisa Keene has been around since the Disney magic of Mermaid, Beauty & Beast and Lion King. She and the others are in my opinion the unsung heroes of \\"Tangled\\". This movie keeps me optimistic that Disney will once again be the pinnacle of animation.
B004SBX112|1.0|The Android Market already has the Easter update!  WTF Amazon?   The rest of the review is to fill the twenty-five word minimum. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah.
0439023491|4.0|I read \\"The Hunger Games\\" around two years ago and was struck dumb by how terrifyingly easy it would be for something similar to happen in real life.  Don't think so?  Consider for a moment that we've already got the preliminary ingredients in the books of human history.  Simply combine a totalitarian government scenario, such as the oppression seen in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany, along with the bloody popularity of Roman gladiator sports.  Easy.  Yikes!<br /><br />Though I greatly enjoyed \\"The Hunger Games,\\" life got in the way and I never quite got around to reading \\"Catching Fire\\" until a few days ago.  I was immediately sucked back into Katniss' story and could not -- for the life of me -- put the book down!  The long separation I took between #1 and #2 probably made the reunion even more satisfying to read as I rediscovered Katniss, Peeta, and Gale as they struggled to resist the iron grip of The Capitol.<br /><br />Read \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  Then, read \\"Catching Fire.\\"  800+ four-star and five-star reviews can't be wrong.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I actually prefer to use this app most times instead of using the stock android music player.  I've put a good amount of music on the cloud to listen to when ever I want to and I have some music on my actual device as well.<br /><br />I do think the background should be black since that seems to take less battery, plus the contrast of white on black is easier to see than vice versa.<br /><br />I think the Cloud import function should give the option to convert files that aren't mp3 to mp3.  Its not necessary but if it did do that I wouldn't need to open iTunes for much of anything.<br /><br />Great updates.
B00008G7UJ|4.0|The high number of 4 & 5 star reviews, along with the significant number of 1 star reviews, speak exactly as to the polarizing effect this movie seems to have on people.  In my years of teaching high school English and encountering this play every spring with my 9th graders, I've found that instructors either consider this film to be a work of brilliance or a hopeless joke... Baz Luhrmann does not leave room for the \\"meh\\" that lies in between.<br /><br />I could easily write a thesis on this film, as there's just so much to run and play with as a Literature fanatic.  Want to decipher the gloriously bright palette of color in the opening rumble?  The possible symbolism of the costumes (Montagues in bright, unbuttoned, hawaiian-print shirts; Capulets with subdued, early-mid 20th century gangster wear)?  The beauty and grittiness of the street scenes filmed in Mexico?  The fascinating juxtaposition between sinks, aquariums, pools, and downpours of water as the couple is together, versus the drought conditions that Romeo experiences as an exile in Mantua?<br /><br />Romeo + Juliet is both undoubtedly smart and a feast for the eyes.
B004OKFIYU|4.0|Sometimes you DO get what you pay for. If you have an SACD player or even if you don't this CD/SACD disc features probably the best transfer I've heard of \\"Piano Man\\" in the digital realm. Joel's second album also generated a minor hit with the title track \\"Piano Man\\" but what it is most noticeable for is how it was influenced by The Band and Elton John--the latter's \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" (itself influenced by The Band)clearly informed Joel's songwriting here whether it be about Billy the Kid with it's Aaron Copeland influenced string arrangement (that also at times recalls western scores like those from \\"The Big Country\\" and of composer Elmer Bernstein who wrote the score for the seminal western \\"The Magnficent Seven\\")or the epic commentary track \\"Captain Jack\\" about a suburban teenager's life including drug use to take the edge off his boredom. Each track has its own unique character and Joel manages to embrace a variety of styles from lounge singer to social commentator.<br /><br />Lyrically this isn't Joel's best album with some lyrics a bit clumsy compared to his later work but the ambition and talent are both on display.<br /><br />The CD layer sounds terrific and for those who have an SACD player, again, we get additional depth, warmth and a superior soundstage. The SACD layer IS NOT in 5.1 I should note as there are those that might wonder about that. Nevertheless, it sounds warm and captures little details that probably haven't been noticed since the album was first mastered.<br /><br />Recommended.
031261246X|5.0|What a fantastic book from Russinovich.  I have gone from loving/using his tools at work to loving/reading his books at home.  Can't wait for the next one Mark!    I did find the \\"chat-speak\\" unbecoming of the protagonist but not enough to detract from the book.
B003L1ZXCU|4.0|I picked up this book after hearing about it from multiple people who really like it. I read a few chapters, laughed it off, then put it down.  After some encouragement, I kept reading, and I'm glad I did. It was an enjoyable read. While I still feel I was tricked into it by cheap hooks in the beginning, I wound up reading the whole thing. I enjoyed it, mostly because I liked the subject matter's uniqueness (though familiar to any Sci-Fi reader) and it teetered on the plausible, which is what kept me at it. It was enjoyable, and the techno thriller piece worked even though it began to unravel towards the end. The characters were paper-thin, all over the place, and some just disappeared altogether. Yet I can't say I disliked it. It was better than I thought and at times couldn't put it down. I suggest giving it a try if you're looking for an entertaining read. The comparisons to Crichton though are unwarranted, outside of the initial subject matter.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Why is the version here not the updated one for easter? This is a major fail for amazon. I am deeply disappointed. If this is how amazon's market is going to operate, I will no longer use it.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Spoiler alert: This review contains spoilers.    How do you make a story about an extremely powerful protagonist (who is also beautiful, smart, wealthy, and with powerful friends) compelling?  You have to make it so that not all her power is fully at her disposal so that there is suspense as to whether she will be strong enough to defeat her foes.  Mission accomplished.  But the rule that the story relies on to create this suspense--that Diana can't control her magic but it only comes when she \\"needs it\\"--doesn't hold water throughout the plot.  Diana gets to use her magic whenever she closes her eyes and walks, when she's out of control with emotions, when she's sleeping, and when she wants to simplify a chore like getting a book down from on high.  These aren't times of \\"need\\".  Then she's getting tortured and suffering absolute pain but that doesn't qualify as \\"needing\\" magic?    Beyond that central flaw, our two main characters end up feeling flat to me despite the fact that character development is about the only thing that happens in this book.  Diana needs to nap a lot in a way that I find strange and boring to read about.  Matthew is enigmatic but none of his secrets feel as thrilling as he seems to think they are.    And at the end of the book, I was really disappointed to realize that the story was not going to wrap up AT ALL.  This just leaves you, hanging, mid-story.    And despite all of that, I liked the book well enough to read it all at a pretty rapid clip, and I'd totally have already downloaded the sequel if it were out today.  Not sure that I'll find it worth delving back into months or years down the road, though.  This feels like a rough draft that should have been smartened up.
B004SBX112|1.0|Great game but the ads version on the Android Market version is better if you want the updates. You MUST really consider which apps are important to you. If it's one you'll keep for a short time, get it from Amazon.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|So I have listened to Wasting Light about a dozen times all the way through now, and I think it is certainly superior in memorability to ESPG and In Your Honor. The songs are extremely hooky, and this album will probably produce 3-4 radio hits: Bridge Burning (although less than likely because it takes so long to get into the chorus), Rope (already promoted up the wazzoo), White Limo (I can only hope), These Days (for sure; very easy on the ears), and Walk (IMO, the best and most memorable track on the album; many have called it the sequel to New Way Home from TC&TS, and I have to agree). I think two of the best tracks on the album will not make it to the \\"hit\\" lists: Dear Rosemary and I Should Have Known (here I definitely disagree with the review). All of the tracks are very, very good, though.    I think the musicianship on this album makes it the best of the Foo albums in that category, from the solo on Rope to the slow building fury of Walk. Lyrically, these are some of the most introspective songs they have ever produced. I think what keeps this from being among the best, however, is that the songs are almost TOO immediate, kind of like the hits off their past three albums: songs like Times Like These, The Pretender, Best of You. These are quality songs all, but they just aren't as original and fresh-sounding as songs like Good Grief from Foo #1 and Wind Up from TC&TS.    I don't want to make this sound like a smack-down of the album by any means. I think it stands as a Houses of the Holy among Led Zeppelin II and IV. A great album (did I mention that it is right there with the top 2 as their most cohesive body of work?) among all-time classics. I can still listen to Foo #1 and it still causes sparks as if it was the first time I heard it. Its rawness is something I real miss. I wish they took the analog recording of Wasting Light and didn't refine it so much to clean up the distortion of the instruments. I also think TC&TS has more energy and stop-and-go dynamics that they have not been willing to match since.    I still listen to Foo Fighters' 1st album and TC&TS more than the others. This album reminds me a lot of There is Nothing Left to Lose in terms of production quality, but it has a very different sound, much more serious and straight rockish.  TNLTL is a lot lighter and humorous. One by One and ESPG are IMO right behind these two, followed by In Your Honor.   Wasting Light is certainly their best album in a over a decade.  So a summary:  FF=TC&TS > TNLTL=Wasting Light > One by One > ESPG > In Your Honor    Diclaimer: I own all their albums and listen to many of them often (except In Your Honor, which I gave up on to a large degree).
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Purchased this DVD from Amazon.  Had to have this movie to continue the ongoing story of past memories of toys we grew up with.

B0006PV5U8|5.0|I just made the jump to SACD with the Heifetz recordings in the Living Stereo series that I've been listening since the original LP versions. I had been hesitant because I'm not into multichannel for music. I've auditioned several setups, and the effect seems artificial at best, chaotic at worst. in the CD format, even though the dynamic range and the clarity had been greatly improved, its brightness had me reaching for the treble control. This was pleasantly resolved with the SACD edition. The SACD also adds depth which makes the performance more lifelike even with \\"only\\" two speakers. The Sibelius is among the top three violin concertos right up there with Beethoven's and Tchaikovsky's. I recommed this gem, in particular, to my fellow stereo enthusiasts with a SACD player.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Purchased this DVD from Amazon.  One of the most heartfelt movies of all time.  Makes you remember all the toys you had as a kid and wished you kept them with you.  A Great movie for the whole family.  Wonder where my Tonka Dump Truck is right now............

B004SBX112|5.0|Amazon appstore is not at fault for the delayed update.  I have messaged rovio and they said it was the first angry birds update on amazon and they ran into some problems.  Don't get mad at Amazon they are giving us paid Apps for free and yet people still complain.  SMH!
B002ZG980U|1.0|This movie has to be one of the BORINGEST movies I have ever seen..It gets a big fat yawn from me. I watched this in the theatre with my 13 year old niece and I spent the better half of the movie looking at my watch wondering when this movie would end. I was so happy when it 'finally' ended I applauded from happiness that my torture of watching it was over. Only reason I stayed to finish watching it was because of my niece. if she had said she wanted to leave, I would've gladly left before the movie ended. Turns out my niece hated the movie as much as I did. When it was over she said 'OMG I never want to see this movie again as long as I live. You could not pay me enough money to watch this movie again.'
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's simple: I am a huge sci-fi fan. I understand the mind of a sci-fi fan. When great, iconic stories are created, like Star Wars, those who own the rights to these franchises cannot release updated packages and NOT include \\"original\\" uncut or unaltered version too (ESPECIALLY since Blu-Ray hold so space, they could fit all the original Star Wars movies on 1 single Blu-Ray disc 3 times over! if they wanted to...)<br /><br />Again, the problem is simple: If original, fan favorite versions are NOT included, I would consider this release a \\"money-making\\" scam. A popular marketing tactic employed by MOST (not all) major studio's and intellectual property owners of franchises these days. Most likely, a newer, better version of this package will be released years from now, essentially screwing anyone who bought this inferior package. No thanks George, you can keep your \\"avatar wanna be\\" marketing to yourself...
B000MQC9H4|3.0|It was a good movie to watch once but not to watch again. It was too long and at times kind of boring. The kind of movie I would like to rent but not own it. Once was enough for me.
B004IFYN2E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because it was just the right action and I thought it had a interesting plot with a surprise at the end.  I love Jolie in mostly everything she does.  Jolie thrives on action with entertainment and mystery.  I haven't been disappointed in any movie she has played in.  The Tourist is a movie I would recommend.
1400067936|3.0|I was really excited to read this book as I heard many good things.  Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand Taleb's ideas/concepts.  I thought he spent the first half of the book explaining what he was going to explain.  Frustrating.  Then we go down this path of we know nothing and are surprised by random events - unless you were one of the terrorists on 9/11 then it wasn't a random event.  Not sure we needed hundreds of pages to explain that.  Again, maybe I just ain't too smart.
B002VWNICW|3.0|Plenty of reviews here already address the Movie vs BBC Mini-Series angle (personally, I love both), so I'll just comment on the Blu-Ray itself.<br /><br />As a happy owner of the DVD, I wanted the Blu-Ray for the boost in image, and this release does not disappoint. The picture looks absolutely gorgeous: crisp and clear, with subtle yet rich colors. Pause at any point during the movie and you have a beautiful still on your screen. I don't currently have a set-up that takes advantage of the 5.1 audio mix, but it sounds just fine coming out of my tv speakers.<br /><br />Alas, to get to the movie, one must first navigate the horrendous BD Live system. Not content to stack trailer upon trailer onto a disc, the movie studios now force download a \\"fresh\\" trailer every time the movie plays. Skipping it is not an option. The disc allows no interaction until the trailer is downloaded, and even then, exiting the trailer is a nightmare: FF, SCAN, and NEXT are all disabled. If you don't give up easily you can eventually kill it (continuous pressing of \\"POP UP MENU\\" is one way), but that's two minutes of your life gone EVERY TIME you start the disc.<br /><br />Once you make it to the menu, prepare to be horrified. Thanks to BD Live there is a movie ticker along the upper right of the screen. Mercifully, this steady stream of marketing can be turned off, but the studios' desire to turn a simple menu into a perpetual commercial is enough to make me abandon Blu-Ray for DVD. The horror doesn't end there. Despite the Jane Austen pedigree, the menu designer opted instead to go with a slick, futuristic interface that looks better suited to [[ASIN:B002AT4K9G Fast & Furious]], not Ms. Bennet & Mr. Darcy. The DVD release - actually, even the movie website from 2005 - did a better job with the menu.<br /><br />There's a lot to be annoyed at, but at the end of the day, the Blu-Ray treatment of the movie itself is absolutely marvelous, so if you're a fan and you find it on sale, it's worth picking up. Just go pop some popcorn or pour a drink while BD Live force-feeds commercials.corn or pour a drink while BD Live force-feeds commercials.
B001CN2WXM|4.0|The crux of L.A.Confedential's subject is the corruption brewing in the Los Angeles area during the 50s. The corruption comes in many forms: the police, organized crime, politics, and tabloid journalism. The film centers around three vastly different police officers: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce),Bud White (Russell Crowe), and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey). Exley is a \\"by the book\\" officer who has ambition to be a great detective like his father. Bud White is an aggressive, hostile type with a short temper and a tendency towards violence. Jack Vincennes is a smooth talking, cool type who knows how to work the system, being in cahoots with the editor of the tabloid magazine.   When a brutal murder takes place at the Nite Owl restaurant, it seemingly links all three officers, who do some investigating on their own into what took place. What they find is a link to another world of serious corruption, where it is difficult to figure out who's being honest and who is a backstabber, what is lie and what is truth. There are cover-ups into crimes, and some police who have crossed over to the other side.     If there was one annoyance, it was the voice-over  narration by Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), editor of Hush Hush magazine. Much of the character's narration didn't really add much to the story, because basically we knew everything he was narrating, so it was unnecessary. It just came across as a bit cheesy.     Still, what makes L.A.Confidential work as noir is the mood created with the 50s atmosphere, the variety of detective types, and the building suspense as the film heads to its final confrontation. While the ending wasn't entirely original, the film was still one of the better films of the 90s, one to go back to.
B004L79VUI|1.0|He can't sing and his solo writing is corny, cliche ridden and pretentious. Hard to believe he wrote those great songs with the Band, but it must be true. I sure as heck don't think Levon wrote them! No point in pretending Robbie can still do it, though. Come on, with a VERY few exceptions, the great 60s songwriters were washed up a generation ago. But the songs do survive.
B003UESJHE|5.0|By this time, anybody that reads the news, particularly the entertainment sections, or simply loves movies, probably knows that \\"The King's Speech\\" deservedly won the Best Picture Prize at the 83rd Academy Award ceremonies. This is what good filmmaking is all about: a simple, yet fascinating story, with no special effects, but classy nevertheless. And all these qualities are augmented with the very special Blu-ray edition of this grandiose film.    The story begins in 1925, when England's King George V (Michael Gambon) asks his second son, the Duke of York (Colin Firth), to give the closing speech at the Empire Exhibition, in Wembley, London. Right away, we notice that the Duke has trouble speaking - he has difficulty saying the words, some kind of stuttering. We then go to 1934, and we find out that the Duke is still trying to cure his speech impediment. He is doing this in strict secrecy, with the help of Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), his wife. They do this for a while, with no success, until someone recommends the services of Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). With time, the Duke and Lionel establish an apparent close bond, which at times is volatile due to the Duke's ego. After a while, the Duke quits Lionel's services and goes back to his imperial life. However, things drastically change when King George V gets sick and dies.  His immediate successor is King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), who, because he chose to marry a divorced woman, gave away his right, under the law, to be king. This situation forces the Duke of York to accept the responsibility to be King George VI.  It also forces the Duke to reconnect with Lionel and restart his speech therapy. And this will prove to be crucial, because England was about to go to war with Germany, and, as one of his advisors tells him, \\"I'm very much afraid, Sir, that your greatest test is yet to come.\\"    \\"The King's Speech\\" is a tale of a very special friendship that, in some way, was apparently important at a pivotalperiod in England's history. Danny Cohen's Oscar -nominated cinematography is majestic and absorbing. For their great work on this film, Colin Firth won the Best Actor Academy Award, while the Best Director Award went to Tom Hooper. The Blu-ray edition also includes audio commentaries by Hooper, a making-of documentary, speeches from the real King George VI, Q&A with Hooper and the Cast, and more. (UK/Australia/USA, 2010, color, 119 mins plus additional materials)      Exclusively reviewed by Eric Gonzalez on April 18, 2011 for Anchor Bay Entertainment.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever, and keeps getting better. Had the free one, and got the paid one after playing. Works great on my EVO.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|First off. Ive used Amazon on demand now for over a year and the only problem i have had with video quality was  because of a weak internet signel. If your only getting one bar then of course its not going to be as clear as if you are at full bars. Some of the problems people are having really sounds likes video settings of video card settings being off or it might be time to get better hardware. I use the Amazon on demand to watch movies on my desktop, laptop, and my HDTV via Roku box, all not more then two years. Video quality is great and everyone i have introduced to the service love it and continue to use it more and more.. If you are having problems with video streaming and dont know how to fix it yourself, Amazon people on staff to help you and answer questions. It would be smart to contact them insted of making ignorant post in a place meant for reviews of the movie itself.     Ok now that is over with i would just like to say that the movie was Great!! If you have watched and liked the other harry potter movies then you will like this movie.
B003WUXU1Q|5.0|This is un-categorical strange music. Compelling at times and not boring or same-y but yet yields aspects that you've likely heard before if you are into this type of stuff. I like the melodies moreso than the vocals.
1587613379|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone considering or participating in any kind of polygomy or polyamory.  My husband and I are swingers and this would have helped us alot with our journey through polygomy.  It is amazing how the authors make this book relevant for everyone straight, bi, gay or transgendered.  This book made me realize that my desire to love many is not wrong but natural and possible!  You are given extensive advice on how to deal with jealously as well as good sound relationship advice.
B004SBX112|1.0|I don't know if rio or amazon is the reason but it's pretty messed up. They should fix this asap. More words needed to review is lame as well.
B004SBX112|1.0|Love angry birds but not updating is un acceptable. Why bother with amazon store if they are not going to update apps. I'm going back to the android market and dumping this BS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is much more polished than the original angry birds and is a great deal of fun. A must have game. Highly recommended A+
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Whoa. What. Just. Happened.<br />Whoa. Its not even the best thing I can say about Florence + the Machine. This album truly rocked! I've got Dogs Days are Over and Cosmic Love stuck in my head all the time. The rest of the songs have great tempo and beat, and great messages. Worth every penny. Buy this, you will enjoy it :)
B0034G4OZE|4.0|There are plenty of stories about troubled teens, this is one of the better ones. I thought the performances quite good, I particularly liked the female lead. There are some nice surprises. And the overall message, choose life, hit home for me.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I was initially underwhelmed by this album, but have come to love it as much as some of their prior work. It is hauntingly beautiful.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|This is the sort of movie that some people are destined to hate... one of the main characters wears a mask, it is based on a graphic novel and so is a bit cartoonish, and it celebrates a violent vigilante. Yet is is a powerful story about responding to oppression, many of the sequences are excellent, and the ending does deliver.
B004RLLDLS|4.0|This is a great album.  Really.  I would say it rocks harder than Black Rock did and has plenty of blues throughout.  What surprised me with this album is how much better Joe's singing has gotten.  The tracks he sings on truly stand out compared to those sung by guests.  We even get a little taste of Black Country Communion with Heartbreaker and it's not bad.   I've had this album for a few weeks now and have given it a chance to really sink in and I really, really like it except for one thing....     On my first listen to this album I was really getting into it when the third track started up.  Now, not only am I not a fan of John Hiatt, I can't think of any song more out of place on a Bonamassa album that this one.  I guess you could start pairing hip-hop hits of the 90's with Italian opera classics if you're searching for a greater oil & water effect but I don't think that's the point here.  When \\"Tennessee Plates\\" played my deep, dream-like Bonamassa induced bliss came to a crashing halt.  The guitar work was actually pretty good on this track but it loses any benefit when paired with hillbilly music.  If I wanted subject my ears to this kind of lyrical and sonic offense I'd go out any buy an album by some guy with two first names wearing faux leather cowboy boots.    Thankfully, my CD player has a skip button which, when consistently employed on the third track, makes this album an absolute joy to listen to.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I can't think of another \\"Rock N' Roll / Action / Comedy / Drama / Comic Book\\" cross-over genre film (is there even one?) since Buckaroo Banzai that captured my attention as much as Scott Pilgrim did.  I found Edgar Wright's over-the-top quick action pacing to be fantastic, the subtle comic dialogue was funny and entertaining, and even Michael Cera, who seems to be getting an unfair bad rap lately, created the perfect Scott Pilgrim.  I liked the film so much that I immediately went out and bought the 6-Volume graphic novel set which actually made me appreciate the film even more.  The attention to detail that was paid to Bryan Lee O'Malley's original books was very impressive.  There is a \\"Novel to Film\\" side-by-side comparison section on the DVD and Blu-Ray which I found fascinating. Overall, if you're looking for something quirky, funny, different, and most important, 100% entertaining on every level, this is a perfect movie!  It's just too bad that it didn't resonate with the masses, but hopefully one day it will get the attention it deserves from a cult following.  Just look at the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes or Box Office Mojo, it's received great reviews!  Why more people didn't see I have no idea. It really is this generations \\"Buckaroo Banzai.\\"
1440503257|4.0|* Recipes: Some of the recipes are a little bit silly and overly simple (I'm thinking of the recipe for bacon... Ingredients? Bacon). Some of the recipes sound disgusting to this non-foodie American, like Haggis or Steak and Kidney Pudding.<br /><br />Most of the recipes fall into the category of VERY simple, like mashed potatoes and buttered peas, or VERY complicated, like the Herbed and Spiced Fried Sausage Patties that call for ingredients like veal (?!), grated lemon zest, and dried marjoram.<br /><br />Still, I've tried a few of the recipes, and the Cinnamon Pull-Apart Breakfast Rolls are seriously delicious, as are the Cheesy, Chivy Scrambled Eggs.<br /><br />  * Not really party food: Almost all of the recipes in this book are for sit-down meals. If you're looking for a book that has more fun-sized treats and appetizers for a Harry Potter party, I'd recommend [[ASIN:1461037875 The Unofficial Harry Potter Party Book: From Monster Books to Potions Class!: Crafts, Games, and Treats for the Ultimate Harry Potter Party]], which includes more of the party-food type of recipes.<br /><br />  * Biggest Annoyance: No pictures. It's really hard for me to tell if something is appealing enough to make without seeing a picture first. Some of the recipes in here are for things I've never heard of, so I would have no idea what it should look like, like mince pies.<br /><br />  * No Butterbeer: I assume because of trademark issues. Too bad.<br /><br />Here's my favorite butterbeer recipe of the many I've tried:<br />1 can of Cream Soda<br />1 teaspoon of Rum Extract<br />1 teaspoon of Butterscotch Extract<br />1 tablespoon of Brown Sugar<br />1 cup of Vanilla Ice Cream<br /><br />It's delicious and very frothy - it looks just like beer.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a fun and useful cookbook. I'll be pulling it out at holidays, especially Christmas.<br />Any Harry Potter fan would be happy with this cookbook, but they might have to look up pictures for some of the more foreign recipes.

0596806027|5.0|[[ASIN:0596806027 HTML5: Up and Running]] is Mark Pilgrim's book on HTML5. The entire text of the book is also available at DiveintoHTML5.org. Just like the other books written by Mark (Dive into Python, Greasemonkey Hacks), this book will serve as a very comprehensive introduction to the topic.<br /><br />The book begins with history of HTML specification starting from conversations on www-talk mailing lists to formation of W3C and to WHAT Working Group. Then it moves on to Feature Detection, high level view of new features - canvas, video, Storage, Web Workers, Geolocation. The next chapter is a dive into details of the Document elements, new semantic elements. The next few chapters cover in detail each of the new features - Canvas, Video & Audio, Geolocation, Local Storage, Offline applications, Form semantics, Microdata. Each of these later chapters can be read stand-alone without depending on others.<br /><br />There are some open source projects mentioned in the book - Modernizr for HTML5 feature detection, geo.js for smoothing out differences over gelolocation APIs. These pointers should be of great value to developers.<br /><br />The book website is itself a great study in HTML5 with its very detailed attention to live examples, typography. Great work by Mark once again and kudos to O'Reilly for allowing full version (which is in fact more up-to-date than the printed book) online and also for selling the ebook in DRM free formats!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am writing this post as a part of Blogger Review program. I am not being paid to write this review. But I received the ebook free for doing this

0375851569|5.0|This book is meant for a special education student I had in my class a few years ago. She just had her first child and I wanted to make sure she read to her baby every night at bed time. Dr. Seuss is perfect for this!
0439023521|5.0|I loved this trilogy!  My daughter who is 12 also read it, and we have now passed it on to other family members.  I loved the detailed writing, you really felt as if you could see and touch what was there.  It was very fast paced, and you constantly were cheering for Katniss and Peeta!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is coming to town this fall, & I was curious about the music in the show.  I bought this CD because Kristin Chenoweth sings one of the leads.  I love her voice.  This is an awesome CD with great music.  I think my favorite song is \\"For Good\\".  Listen to the words,  because I think it teaches an excellent lesson everyone could apply to their lives.  Defying Gravity and Popular are also really good songs.
0439023513|3.0|I have to start off by saying I loved the first book \\"Hunger Games\\" and was hooked from the start. And \\"Catching Fire\\" held it's own too. Both were well written, fast paced and really pulled you into a totally plausible dystopic future where people are bloodthirsty enough to watch children fight to the death on tv.  The characters were rich and the storytelling was crisp.<br /><br />That being said I did want more from the final chapter of the series. I understand that repeating the hunger games from the previous 2 would have been redundant and it was necessary to shake things up. I just found the intro of District 13 to be lackluster. The deaths of major characters were minor blips and not given the justice they deserved. And the politics of it all a little boring. In a nutshell I just wanted more somehow.<br /><br />That doesn't mean it was all bad. I enjoyed the trilogy more than I have other books in a long time. Definetely worth reading if you want to get caught up in an all too tragic but realistic future.
1416955070|5.0|Read it, read it, read the whole series and read it again! I love this series!<br />Sooo great, sexy, twisty, awesome!
0823095223|5.0|I have been sculpting and making OOAK heads for a few years now and I wish this book had been written sooner. Of all the books in my library this is the only one to deal with Apoxie Sculpt, plastics, and resin casting in a strait forward way. They show you how to mold and cast but throw in important steps like making gates that other doll making books have glossed or skipped all together. This is the only book I have come across to deal with casting resins in a strait forward manner.     This book leads you through the process of concept art, rough sculpt from several choices of sculpting materials, to wax casting, to resin casting and painting. Two figures are made, the static pose Athena and a jointed Thor. Step by step painting guides are shown with many clear photographs. This is not exactly a how-to book, it won't take you from no experience to producing a line of action figures over night. It will be less frustrating if you have some artistic experience and have done a bit of sculpting but I will recommend this book for artists, sculptors, and doll makers of all levels.     Doll makers may want to pair this book with [[ASIN:1932485589 Learning To Be A Doll Artist]] this too starts with a static figure and covers wax casting but gets in to slightly different joint mechanics before porcelain casting. Between the two, and the Yoshida BJD book or at least the gist of that idea, you have the best books I've ever seen for creating your own models of people.
B00314VYNE|5.0|My niece loves Cowgirl Jessie so we got her this as a birthday present.  She was thrilled!  We ended up attaching a string to the hat so it could hang around her neck when it fell off.  The hair and clothes are great!  She stands easily and is a lot of fun.
B004NO03E2|5.0|Wow! I am very impressed with this release from Denver natives Havok. They have been praised by metal legend Gene Hoglan for being pure and in your face thrash and by listening to this album I can see exactly why. If the approval of ex-Dark Angel, ex-Death, and current Dethklok drummer isn't enough, then feel free and take a listen for yourself. Right from the get go, this album gets your blood pumping with \\"Prepare for Attack\\". Definitely seems like an homage paid to Metallica and Megadeth with more intense vocals and beefed up production and drumming. The intensity doesn't let up for a minute as we hear \\" Fatal Intervention\\" open with it's Testament-like riff and then totally explode with the verse riff. Who had thought the days of catchy ,chanted thrash choruses were gone? I might have for a second but songs like this remind us of what made metal the ultimate form of expression and aggression in music. \\"D.O.A.\\" is so very catchy and heavy as a ten ton hammer smashing your testes in that you may not have a face or a crotch after listening to it. They have definitely stepped up their approach for this record as you can tell there is more defined guitar leads and the overall intensity has actually tripled since \\"Burn\\". The title track is probably my favorite though. It closes the album out very well and leaves you wanting more and more. Seriously you will not want this record to end and you will be playing it on repeat for months to come and annoying all of your friends who don't listen to metal. Go and get it now cause there is no way in hell you can be disappointed with this album unless you prefer Justin Bieber. If you answered yes to the last question then you better run cause your \\"TIME IS UP\\"\m/

B004SBX112|1.0|The game is 5 stars...  Amazon is only 1.    With the Easter update impending, I decided to spring for the ad-free version in order to avoid the frustration of ads getting in the way...

I'm about 12 hours from uninstalling and going back to the free version from Google's marketplace, and abandoning Amazon for anything but their free apps.
B001CL4N68|1.0|\\"Pinocchio\\" was surely considered impressive at it's time of release (1940) by critics and the audiences alike; however, in present day it looks outdated and goofy compared to the recent advances in animation that are created by Pixar. Like Pinocchio, \\"Illmatic\\" is nothing but novelty, and only nostalgic to businessmen who are in their 40s by now. With outdated social issues taking prevalence in most of the songs, one can only feel relieved at how far rap has come since this album was released! Lil' Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Black Eyed Peas and Eminem have thankfully revived this once dead genre, so I suggest that everyone gets with the times and listen to those talented folks instead.<br /><br />P.S: Where are all the lyrics about hoez? Uuugh.
0307887960|4.0|PROS:<br />- Nice plan which transitions from dieting to rest-of-your-life eating, with no counting or measuring.<br />- Some good recipe suggestions.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Many assertions are not supported by studies.<br />- It risks unhealthy levels of protein<br /><br />This book describes a really well-thought-out diet plan with lots of very good suggestions, and it is well-worth reading for those wishing to lose weight. The ideas in this book are not new, but the overall formulation and plan is a good one (with reservations noted below).  It follows the typical diet book formulation of wordy descriptions in the first half, one chapter per phase, and recipes and menus in the second half.  However, it should not be your only source of diet information.<br /><br />This book combines the best of carb-avoidance for weight loss, along with fat-avoidance as well.  But one problem is that avoiding both fat and carbs (at the early stages) means you eat only protein, which means you may end up consuming unwise amounts of protein for the body to handle.  (For more on this, look at the books by Willett, Taubes, or the Eades, which any hopeful dieter should also read.)<br /><br />An important contribution is that the eating plan brilliantly continues after the target weight is reached, to avoid regaining weight (two of the phases, about half the book). You slowly add in more and more foods that do include some fat and carbs, until you transition at the end to a long-term healthy style of eating.  Each stage is simply described by lists of foods to include and patterns of eating, with no counting of calories or grams.  Additionally once the diet gets going, there are times for \\"celebration\\" meals, and in maintenance there are periodic diet days, both of which would seem to help with short and long term success.  There are also activity and exercise suggestions that (mostly) make sense.<br /><br />I also like some of the recipe suggestions.  I get tired of every diet food being artificially sweetened, so I'm interested in trying the  recipe for a custard which is made without sweetener, with the sense of dessert coming from vanilla and nutmeg.  And there are lots of other savory recipes that sound good to try as well.<br /><br />My other problem with this book is that he says things that make sense, but are not borne out by studies.  For example, to burn more calories, Dukan suggests being cold and swimming.  The only problem with this is that Covert Bailey (Fit or Fat) found that swimming was the one aerobic exercise that did not seem to reduce surface fat, and he speculated that the body of a swimmer needs the fat as insulation.  So while Dukan's idea of being cold to burn calories sounds reasonable, it is probably a bad one.  Much of the book consists of things that sound sensible but aren't supported by studies, such as the reasonable-sounding daily egg & oat bran pancake or the high levels of water consumption.<br /><br />Still, I really like this book and the diet plan, and highly recommend it to dieters, but please also read Eades (Protein Power) to understand why some fat has a place in a low-carb adequate-protein diet for weight loss (as well as why this low-carb approach makes sense).ying the  recipe for a custard which is made without sweetener, with the sense of dessert coming from vanilla and nutmeg.

Much of the book consists of things that sound sensible but aren't supported by studies, such as the reasonable-sounding daily egg & oat bran pancake or the high levels of water consumption.    Still, I really like this book and the diet plan, and highly recommend it to dieters, but please also read Eades (Protein Power) to understand why some fat has a place in a low-carb adequate-protein diet for weight loss (as well as why this low-carb approach makes sense).
B000UX6THK|1.0|David Lynch really shouldn't be the only one disgraced for this abomination of a series, because most episodes were directed by different people. What is perhaps most lacking is the absence of a love interest (there wasn't one until the series totally jumped the shark), which elevates Twin Peaks to another level of disinterest. Too slow of a pace, too many irrelevant side plots and a serious air of pretentiousness make this show a total bust- instead, focus your time & energy on Glee, Family Guy or Two and a Half Men, which are good family fun.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Tron: Legacy was everything I was hoping it would be. It has amazing special effects, great story, talented actors and the 3D was even great. This Blu-ray contains the 2D BD, 3D BD, DVD, & Digital Copy, along with Disney Movie Rewards points. The video quality is amazing and I never noticed anything I didn't like. The IMAX scenes are included so it goes from widescreen to IMAX a few times, but it isn't really noticeable. The audio is great and the soundtrack to the movie is the best I have ever heard. The only thing I was disappointed about was the special features. There are only a few and they aren't that good. Flynn Lives was disappointing, but would probably be better for people that are big fans of the original. Installing the Cast just talked briefly on five actors. First Look at Tron: Uprising was just like a scene from the new show. It does look good, but it doesn't really tell you anything about the show. Visualizing Tron takes you behind the scenes of the movie, but I wish it was longer.  Launching the Legacy was a behind the scenes look at how this film came to be. This was probably the most interesting feature on the disc. Disc Roars was just the audience at Comic Con making noise that was used in the film which was pretty useless. There is also a music video and short trailers for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and more. There is also a feature called Second Screen that can be used on your computer or iPad that lets you look at behind the scenes stuff while the movie is playing. There is no BD Live so there won't be any added features in the future. Overall, everything about this release is outstanding except for the special features.
B002X02V02|5.0|Hey fans of Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Duran Duran: I think it's time to put the fanny pack away and embrace the current pop music scene, which is currently dominated by Queen Gaga. Our musical heroine manages to create an album full of songs that are both lyrically and musically satisfying, all while being so outlandish in her persona and stage presence that even the Let's Dance guy would feel inferior. If you're having any doubts in Gaga's magic, remember that her song \\"Bad Romance\\"'s music video has reached over 200 million views on YouTube, cementing her status as a legendary pop visionary.

B001KQKC0Q|5.0|Going to protest the Ground Zero Mosque?<br />Going to have a 4th of July BBQ in your backyard?<br />Going to make a four hour trek to Republican National Convention?<br />If so, it's only natural to let the 'Back be the soundtrack to such endeavors.<br /><br />Chad Kroger, along the other members of the 'Back I guess, have achieved their magnum opus with \\"Dark Horse\\", an album that masterfully combines head banging metal tunes with heartfelt ballads- seems like an unlikely combo, right? The different styles of music all come together in perfect harmony, creating an album that is going to be remembered 40, 50, 60 (!) years from now. Not only are the songs catchy, but the lyrical content reaches a new level of depth, notably \\"S.E.X\\" and \\"Just to Get High\\", which have a message that while promiscuity is OK, drug use of any kind is not. I recommend this album not just to serious music fans, but children can also learn a thing or two from Kroger's inspiring words. Fire up the grill or put the Dodge Caravan into drive and let this CD rip! Yeaaah!

B00006G8K0|4.0|THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN put Hammer Film Productions on the horror map, and the studio was quick to follow it with yet another take on a classic monster: Dracula, the film known in England as DRACULA but in the United States as THE HORROR OF DRACULA, in order to avoid confusion with the Bela Lugosi DRACULA, which was still very popular.<br /><br />Like Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN, Bram Stoker's DRACULA has never really received an accurate filming, and this is no less true of THE HORROR OF DRACULA than it is of any other version--and indeed, this version takes more liberties than most.  Jonathan Harker arrives at Dracula's castle, presumably a librarian come to sort out the count's books.  In actual fact, however, he is a vampire hunter who has come to kill Dracula.  He does indeed dispatch Dracula's bride, but not Dracula (Christopher Lee) himself, and Dracula goes forth to seek revenge on Harker's family: his wife Lucy (Carol Marsh), her brother Arthur (Michael Gough), and his wife Mina (Melissa Stribling.)  Fortunately, the family has a champion in vampire killer Van Helsing (Peter Cushing.)<br /><br />Shot in brilliant color with lots of blood flowing over the skin exposed by low cut dresses, THE HORROR OF DRACULA made an overt connection between Dracula's bite and orgasm--something no version had dare do before.  All the gore and heaving breasts seems almost quaint to us today, in 1958 it was very shocking indeed.  The film was rated X and considered scandalous, received a lot of critical condemnation, and given all the fuss naturally drew a flood of patrons to the box office.  The movie's success confirmed Hammer in the notion of making updated versions of older horror films, and \\"Hammer Horror\\" was a cinema mainstay for over a decade, making stars of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and furthering the careers of such notables as Oliver Reed.  They also pushed the envelope of what was acceptable in a horror film, and as time passed the gore became even more bloody and the breasts became increasingly bare.<br /><br />There is a lot of fuss about the currently available DVD of THE HORROR OF DRACULA, with purists complaining about graininess and ratio and such.  My thought: the DVD isn't pristine, and we can hope something better in the future, but this version is quite good, so don't fret too much about it.  Unfortunately, there are no extras to speak of, but that shouldn't stop the fun.  Recommended for fans of the Hammer Horror genre.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewereasts became increasingly bare.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love 30 Rock, loved Tina on SNL.  If you like her style, then you will probably like this book.  It was written as if she were reading it aloud.  I read it in a day.
B001KVZ6LQ|4.0|This picture book blu-ray release of the movie that inspired scores of special effects technicians such as the late, great Ray Harryhausen among many others is a bit of a mixed bag.  I also had the [[ASIN:B00003CXAW King Kong (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]with the tin case and after careful observation although the blu-ray still looks a little better than the dvd, it is difficult to justify if the \\"upgrade\\" is worth it.  For me I am satisfied as although all the special features from the dvd are here with nothing new added the picture book is nice to look at and at least the picture and sound qualities are slightly better than that of the dvd albeit not very much so.<br /><br />Still Willis O'Brien did miracles here and the epic monster battle that inspired countless future Godzilla ones here of Kong v. T-Rex will always be a high point of the film.  In many ways this is still among the best ever monster-run-amuck films ever made and the action moves along very quickly giving you little time to catch your breath once the film gets going after the introduction of Kong.  Max Steiner's score is remarkable and that alone made it worth it to watch the film and it set the standard for all future film scores to come.<br /><br />Although this blu-ray release sports a better picture and sound quality than the dvd release and I'm happy with the upgrade I do appreciate that some will feel that it's not worth the upgrade as no new special features are included and unlike say [[ASIN:B0020MMRC0 The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray]]] or to a lesser extent [[ASIN:B002VWONB2 Casablanca [Blu-ray]]] where the difference between blu-ray and dvd is like night and day this blu-ray version of Kong is not going to make you feel compelled to upgrade from the dvd unless you like the picture book enough to want to get it.<br /><br />If you don't already have this it is a worthy addition to your video library but if you already got the special edition dvd you are not losing out too much if you decide not to upgrade.t to upgrade.
031261246X|4.0|This is a cautionary tale about cyber-terrorism, by Mark Russinovich, who is in the top tech position at Microsoft, so he should know!<br /><br />As we use computers for more and more, we have the technology to help keep ourselves safe, but not everyone uses it or keeps it up to date. Cyber attacks are a real threat, and in this book we see the nightmare come to life. The threats escalate, deaths happen, due to computerized pharmacy records, businesses face ruin, and a reactor meltdown is imminent.<br /><br />Jeff Aiken is a former government analyst who now owns his own security business, cleaning up messes. His client is a law firm who have lost all of their electronic records, billings, briefs, etc. As Jeff tries to close in on the virus, hospitals are being hit with the wrong prescriptions being given to patients, resulting in deaths. An airliner loses control and nearly crashes to Earth.<br /><br />Jeff contacts others working in the cyber security business to see if they have uncovered anything like what he is dealing with. The trail leads to Russia and France where people are being murdered to keep the secret and time is running out.<br /><br />This was a very modern thriller, full of technical information, but not so much that I couldn't understand it.<br /><br />Security is no simple thing, but backing up and using the tools available to us is a good start. I immediately backed up, updated antivirus and spyware software, and ran it all! Yes, it scared me silly!!<br /><br />This book was an intelligent thriller with a message. We are vulnerable, both personally and as a society.<br />I can recommend this to anyone reading this blog, since you are probably on a computer, and to anyone who loves a good thriller.<br /><br />I received this book for review from Phenix and Phenix Literary Publicists. Thank you!
B002VWONB2|3.0|As a true classic should be, this movie is so good that you actually look forward to viewing it again and again just so you can be sure you didn't miss anything the last time you viewed it. The cast is excellent, the acting sublime, the soundtrack is inspired and the screenplay is also exquisite. Special mention should be made for actors like Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains who are excellent here just as they were in other film classics such as \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\". Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\"), he still puts in an excellent performance here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Blu-ray version is a mixed bag especially so for the sound quality which is only slightly better than the dvd release. The volume levels are very soft for some scenes so that you can scarcely hear the dialogue while for others the levels inexplicably increase.  Unlike the great work they did with [[ASIN:B0020MMRC0 The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray]]] where they used DTS HD MA for the sound here they used just Dolby Digital which just didn't cut it and so overall is a disappointment and an opportunity lost in doing justice to a great film.<br /><br />After waiting so long for the Blu-Ray release it is an anti-climax that we get this mixed bag release with very good picture but poor sound quality albeit both are better than in the dvd release.

B003ZYU3T6|5.0|This is the second Criterion Blu-ray release that I've seen after [[ASIN:B00393SFU2 M (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]and I am still impressed at just how good they are at restoring classic old films to as close to perfection that they can.  Kino did an excellent job with the Fritz Lang film that this film borrows greatly from i.e. [[ASIN:B0040QYROK The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray]]]but Criterion has improved greatly both the picture and sound quality of the score over the previous dvd version.  I tried very hard but I could hardly find any picture imperfections taking into account the fact that this is a 75-year old film.  The special features are also very good as is usual for a Criterion release.<br /><br />I have watched this film a few times and I never tire of watching it.  There are just too many excellent sequences to mention and so you'll have to watch it yourself to truly appreciate the genius of Chaplin.  Chaplin himself preferred \\"The Gold Rush\\" as his personal favourite film which is also a classic and while \\"City Lights\\" is also very good \\"Modern Times\\" for me is still overall his best silent film.  Like Lang before him in \\"Metropolis\\" Chaplin shows how technology and innovation can only be helpful to humanity if compassion and common sense is used.  Otherwise man becomes a slave to the machine instead of the other way around.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies of all time and like any classic, I find myself enjoying it more every time I watch it.  Excellent picture and sound quality, great bonus features and excellent content makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Below is an excerpt of my full review of The Hunger Games trilogy:<br /><br />Grim only begins to describe the life people live in the districts. Some people are better off than others, but deaths caused by starvation are regularly occurring events, stealing or going outside the district's fence results in death, and a boy and a girl from ages 12 to 18 are selected for events where the more brutality involved, the more entertaining the event for its viewers. Flip to Capitol life and people live an exotic life of luxury with capable technology reminiscent of Star Trek: The Next Generation. The most entertaining part was definitely during two of The Hunger Games and the assault on the Capitol late in Mockingjay. I kept wondering how Catching Fire would end and was treated to something pleasantly unexpected. When things are looking bad near the end of Mockingjay, the unrestrained inhumanity of a few strikes a devastating blow that are a bit mind blowing.<br /><br />Mockingjay`s ending was pretty good, but it felt a little rushed. Without revealing too much, I think that Collins could have incorporated the last major event a bit better in earlier chapters rather than have it come up at the end of one of the final ones. It caused quite a stir given what followed, but bits and pieces could have made it more of a guessing game throughout the final book. I suppose that is where young adult fiction separates itself from adult fiction, maintaining a slightly devious plot rather than one with many twists and turns. The love triangle felt a little weak at times due to Katniss' ineptitude towards romance for either character that were vying for her affection. It did not help that Katniss, who has zero experience with romance, instantly turned into an A class actor by being a star struck lover with Peeta. Most of the interaction was not bad because it did not feel like petty teenage drama, but Katniss could deliver when there was a crowd, yet not when it really mattered in terms of the love story.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy is very entertaining and I can easily see why it is so popular. I did not care for the entire series being in the first person from beginning to end, so with the movie that will soon be produced, I hope they are not bogged down by the love story and Katniss only and instead give more spotlight time to other characters that had a hand in propelling the books forward, like Rue, Haymitch, Finnick, Beetee, Coin and even President Snow.y.

B003L77GGK|2.0|Copycat storylines  The Brother Division  Storylines that were brought up and then hardly mentioned again  Lisa/Ben/Dean  Half the cast being killed off    The start of S6 is a complete and utter mess. It's like, Sera or whoever just couldn't figure out what to do with it and so the season felt off and was scattered. Plus I don't even know what the main storyline for this season is supposed to be about since there's just so many options for that, most of which, just haven't been talked about. IMO, it was better with Kripke.     HOWEVER,    Around the second half of the season {which the exception of 'The French Mistake' which was awful except for the few bits that were actually funny} it does get better and starts to get a good flow and with that said, I'm hoping that if there is an S7, that it's done better because S6, at the end of the day, was a failure and not worth paying big dollars for unless you get a gift with it.    I was disappointed with S6, I thought it had a chance to be amazing and it wasn't. The only thing that can save it is the last remaining episodes.

B004CR7TE2|4.0|I actually use this to stuff my 15.4\\" Dell into. It is a tight fit for those 15.4\\" laptops (not really meant for this product.. and once you get it in, you have to do a little jiggling back and forth to get it back out, but I'm not in any hurry, and it works well enough for me). I like that there's no additional nonsense bulk to this product. The only thing I would recommend you watch out for is smooth items can slip out easily from the outside pockets since there's nothing holding it in. Things like power cords and headphones with wires will stay put well since the abnormal shape of the cords/wires gives something for the stretchy pocket fabric to wrap around. If you try to put a portable hard drive by itself in the pocket, however, it's likely to slip out if you're holding the sleeve the wrong way since the surface of the hard drive is smooth and there's no real friction between the pocket fabric and the smooth item you want to hold to keep it in place.

B000Y8GFY8|3.0|Over her prior four releases, Allison Goldfrapp hasn't made up her mind what she wants to be, vacillating between the serene, lush, folk of Felt Mountain and Seventh Tree, and the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am glam of Black Cherry and Supernature.  The dichotomy is distinct enough to disappoint fans who end up on the wrong side of a purchase.  Seventh Tree clearly falls into the quiet camp.  Acoustic guitars, strings, and cooed, brooding vocals set a hushed tone throughout, typified by the \\"July, lie, lie\\" hammock swing of \\"Little Bird.\\"  Fans of Belle & Sebastian or Zero7 will curl up under Seventh Tree and dream away the summer.  Fans of Madonna will have to wait `til these leaves fall.
B000002HPT|4.0|I have been slow in picking this album up, based in large part to the very wide range of opinions on this one. Having purchased and listened to this several times, I understand the broad range of opinions.    This album has all the makings of standard Dream Theater except one, it is more tightly contained from a compositional standpoint than any DT album before or since. There is much talk about the band aiming for/being forced toward more \\"main-line\\" rock of the late '90s. Compared to their other music, it is easy to see that factor in this album. However, I think this album is much more than that for the band and the listener.    Musically, this album starts off acceptably well, if unremarkably. In fact, if you insist on being overwhelmed by the technical prowess of the band as you might have on Awake or being burried by the lyrical depth that follows beginning with Scenes, then you will find yourself wondering \\"what happened\\" during the first 3 songs here. That being said, they are not bad songs. However, they are tame on the DT scale of composition.    Begining at Hollow Years, however, the album begins to reel the listener back in. Both it and Burning My Soul begin to sound much more like DT from previous albums. Hell's Kitchen is a good, but not overly impressive, instrumental, especially in light of what will follow.    The absolute highlight of this album is Lines in the Sand. This is a fantastic song made even better by the additional of some backing vocals by Doug Pinnick of King's X. Fans of King's X will immediately appreciate Doug's addition to this song. His vocals are a very good fit as a support for James'. This song seems to mark the shift in DT's sound and lyrical content from past to future while still remaining one of their tighter arrangements overall. In fact, in this case, the song greatly benefits from the tighter approach applied. James' voice is tight and on the mark and all of the solos are very good technically, while still remaining somewhat restrained. Mike's drumming begins to take on some of the additional \\"voice\\" he develops far more fully in future albums. Fittingly, this song rests near the middle of this album.    Following this album are four more songs that tend to remind me more of DT and, looking back chronologically, shadow more of what is to come from DT. Trial of Tears is very enjoyable suite, penned by John Myung and is a good finish to the album.    While I do not consider this one of their \\"better\\" albums, I think there are a couple of important details in the whole of DT history that should be considered. The band was in transition (firing Derek Sherinian not long after this was released). I think that was the case musically as well. At that point in band history, for the band to grow musically, this album, for all it's birthing pains, was the one they HAD to make to allow themselves to grow into the band they are today. After Awake, they needed to \\"prove\\" they could and should go in a different direction. This is their stretching out of their shell defined by Images and Words through Awake. Having done this album, they could then move on more to where their hearts and talents wanted to take them. In that respect, it is an important album.    If you insist that DT must sound like their albums from the 2000s forward, you will likely struggle with this album. If your favorite album of theirs is Images and Words, you will likely not understand nor like this one. If, however, you are interested in what DT sounds like when attempting to constrain themselves more for mass appeal and approach this with an open mind, you will find this one, like nearly all others of theirs, growing on you very quickly. If you find DT, in general, overwhelming, then this album will come as a pleasant surprise. And, as is always the case, it is still better than 90% of what was available back then or is now.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele Adkins' second, 21 lodged itself atop the charts for quite a while, deservedly so.  The leadoff track and hit single \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is a driving, dismissive lament over a loser lover, complete with head-smacking handclaps and a perfectly wailed chorus.  It's followed by an equally compelling \\"Rumour Has It,\\" with its layered, call-and-response vocals.  The key to Adele's appeal is her old-school soul, a brew of Aretha Franklin, Ann Wilson (Heart), and Helen Baylor.  A lukewarm cover of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\" is the only misfit, because Adele's only innovations are a slower tempo and a slightly altered chorus.  Otherwise, 21 is world-wise and ready.  Watch this singer.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|When I heard this CD was coming out, it order it the day it was released. However, I was unsure at first how good it would be (mainly after being disappointed in the recent Finger Eleven CD). After listening over the CD a bit, it was hard to review. All the songs sounded like Foo Fighter songs too me, so that was a good thing. However, I felt like it was missing something, probably another song like \\"The Pretender\\". Most of the songs where good enough to make my Foo Fighter Playlist (all but 2, which is very good) but most of the songs didn't seem memorable enough to me to make my favorite songs list, at least not yet. I think the BEST song has to be Dear Rosemary, which is my #1 song on the CD. It isn't the kind of song I'd expect to be my favorite on a Foo Fighter CD, but something about it and its sound was just unique and catchy. Bridge Burning, Rope, Back & Fourth are my next favorites, but as with most songs on the CD, it is hard to tell the 4 stars from the 5 stars (personal rankings).    So Overall I have to give the CD 5 Stars. Even though I expected a bit more of something, the songs are great and all have their uniqueness.
0131480057|5.0|I have found this book to be a tremendous reference/resource with everything from understanding processes better to in depth dns and sendmail configurations.

B003VANOFY|5.0|3/19/2015 update  I noticed part of the plastic where the swivel on the right earmuff is has cracked, most likely due to one of the occasions that I have knocked it off my desk. Still holds together thanks to several screws, however. The rubber layer on the ear cushions has been peeling like crazy and will no doubtedly soon be gone entirely; it may be time to replace the cushions. Initial connection of the headset dongle still has that weird connect/disconnect cycle issue. Don't know where the problem lies; it happens no matter what port into which the dongle is attached and no matter what version the software is (reinstalling the driver doesn't resolve it, either). Additionally, rarely the headset will lose connection with the dongle and take a few seconds to reconnect. This has happened mid-conversation and is unnoticeable until I hear it reconnect and realize what I was saying the last few seconds didn't go through.  Otherwise, all the benefits are still there -- incredibly crystal clear audio quality with fantastic bass response, microphone is far better than expected with noise cancelling, wireless range and battery life hold up very well, software is very useful and allows for many different configurations for the 3 G keys. It will take a serious game-changer to cause me to replace this thing. &#60;3                           2/10/2014 Amendment                         Still using this headset daily, and I still love it. Audio/mic/construction quality has held up 100%; no damage/breaking has occurred in any form or fashion; range still holds up supremely well (going through several walls); charge still lasts a good 10 hours.  The only downsides are still the cushions (they could be softer, but they are still effective), and initial connection glitches, which are a very minor issue. When I connect the receiver, Windows goes through a cycle of it connecting/disconnecting maybe 3-6 times for a few seconds until it finally settles down. After that, there are no connection problems whatsoever.  5/5 will always recommend forever                         5/10 Amendment                         I wanted to point out something that several customers have mentioned. It is indeed true that the cushions surrounding the earmuffs on this headset may tend to rest on pressure points just behind the jaw. While I can (and usually do) adjust them so they don't, I have noticed this occurring if I just throw them on without thinking twice.  The cushions are not stiff; they are very soft, but the placement of the earmuffs may cause a little tension behind the jaw for some, which may feel uncomfortable. Just a heads up to potential buyers.                         4/27 Amendment                         The new software for the headset (v 1.00.364) addresses noise cancellation, and by that I mean the headset now does noise cancelling! This headset is now perfect. :)  * * WARNING Fairly lengthy review ahead. Proceed at your own risk! * *  I owned a wireless headset prior to this one, the ASUS HS-1000w (oddly enough before it was even on their own website and I could find absolutely ZERO support for it anywhere), and it was great for what it did. However, over time and use, the dongle shorted out and part of the headset where the swivel starts began breaking (this is a common occurrence) -- for both the original and the RMA replacement. So I searched for totally new headset as replacement, and I came across Logitech's G930 and F540 and had to decide between the two. Since at the time the F540 was about $150 and the G930 was on sale at $120 ($119.99 when purchased, $117.99 at the time of this writing), the choice was obvious.  I have owned the G930 headset for about a week, and here are my thoughts.  The package comes with the headset, the dongle, the REALLY COOL rounded charging base (that has inlets that hold the two extra long cables [a WONDERFUL welcome after the obnoxiously short charging cable for the HS-1000w], one for USB and one for USB micro, which plugs into the headset) with its own USB port (which is a REALLY nice feature so I don't have to unnecessarily occupy an extra port to charge and use), and the software CD. The software CD does come with the up-to-date stable software, the same that can be downloaded from the Logtech website. And as an additional note, the USB port on the charging base acts as any regular old USB port, so if I want to charge the headset but use the port on the base for a flash drive or external hard drive or anything else, I have no limits! (...Well, except that I can only use one device in the base at a time.) * * [[SEE AMENDMENT AT END OF REVIEW ABOUT BASE]] * *  The description claims 10 hours of battery, and I have yet to use up all 10 of these, but I will say that I have used it for several hours countless times so far and have yet to hear the &#34;low battery&#34; notification that plays through the headset. What's more, the software gives me a meter and number measurement of how much battery remains or, when charging, how long until fully charged. Very nice!  The software allows adjustment of volume, microphone, Sidetone, and treble and bass levels without touching the equalizer, which can be turned on and off. It also has built-in voice morphing with a &#34;voice preview&#34; option and pitch calibration levels, so you deep talkers won't have it throwing virtual question marks at your unexpectedly low voices. The software also has a surround sound mixer, allowing adjustment of the volume levels for each individual speaker. And lastly, the software has customization for the headset's G-keys, allowing each of the 3 buttons to have a wide range of functionality, from voice morphing to controlling music to push-to-talk to allowing you to select specific functions for unlisted applications!  Sound Quality: When in stereo mode, the sound quality is fantastic. The bass is just the right amount -- not too much, not too little. The treble is of the same caliber, and even ifthey were not the appropriate levels, the software that comes with it (actually very well-made software, too, despite what some people have said) has an equalizer to adjust audio levels. Now, I'm not a surround sound aficionado, but when in 7.1 mode, things sound a little like I am in a tin can. After a while I get used to it and can distinguish between the 7 different speakers, but at first it's strange -- and it affects voices as well, so if I am in a game using 7.1 and talking with someone, they are strangely echoey. Nonetheless, the actual sound quality while in 7.1 mode is, just like stereo mode, excellent. I did notice that 7.1 mode seems to have slightly boosted output levels than stereo mode, and have found most of my games' sounds have occasionally peaked, causing some crackling and distortion. This would normally be a problem if irremediable, but turning down the application volume (not the volume of Windows) corrects this. Guess they got a little overzealous about sound output for surround mode, eh?  Microphone quality: The ASUS had decent microphone quality, but one big problem I noticed is it seemed to have a threshold for the higher frequencies, and it was VERY noticeable. I have had no such microphone problems with the G930 so far, and in fact almost no microphone problems whatsoever. The sound quality is superb, easily picking up my fairly deep voice. It seems that when the headset is turned on each time, its &#34;Sidetone&#34; (hearing your own voice in real-time) feature is activated, but very slight. If I'm in a game, it is unnoticeable, but if I am talking on VoIP, it is somewhat of a nuisance. However, once again the software saves the day, as it allows total adjustment of the Sidetone level from 100% to 0%. The mic swivels up and down about 120 degrees and makes zero noise when adjusting, and the material the tip is made of allows adjustment nearer or further from the mouth. And one thing I think is a very, VERY nice feature is when the microphone is lifted to standby (upright) position, it automatically mutes itself. VERY cool feature, Logitech! No more lifting the microphone and having to worry whether I muted it or not when talking to my friends or family! As an additional note, some users have reported sound quality problems, such as popping or crackling or the like. I currently reside in a college dorm and have had no problems whatsoever with interference. But if such interference does occur, go to the Logitech website and download the Beta software for this headset; most people claim it fixes the problems.  Noise isolation: The only real complaint I have about this headset is Logitech claims it has a noise-cancelling microphone, but I can hear all ambient noises around me clear as day whenever I listen to what my mic records. However, the voice morphing choices that come with the software have noise-cancellation when activated. I'm not sure why this is, but it doesn't really bother me.  Range: The headset claims 40 feet wireless range but I have not tested this in a viable environment (too many walls here). Although I will say that, when walking down the hall with these on, they retain a signal somewhat further than the ASUS did, which claimed ~33 feet wireless range. Nonetheless, 40 feet is more than enough for my purposes.  Style: At first glance, the headset is, honestly, a beautiful device. The soft material over the earmuffs and the headband does not attract fingerprints easily, and the cushions are just the right softness. The button placement is good, with volume/mute/G-keys on the outside of the left earpiece, and the power/7.1 switch on the back of the left earpiece. It took a little getting used to, but once so, it is very easy to use. The boom microphone has a neat-looking angle to it, if I may say, and the earmuffs swivel forward slightly but can swivel 90 degrees back. The volume roller is very effective; instead of clicking a button to adjust volume in levels, I can slide my finger along the roller and volume levels can jump, but at the same time I can only roll it one or two notches and the volume adjusts slightly. This allows for quick but VERY precise adjustments that can be tailored to suit anybody's needs.  Durability: In the duration I have had it, I have treated it like a baby, so I cannot say how well it stands up to rough handling. However, I will point out that the headset does feel very durable and very solid, having a little more weight to it than one would expect but not in a bad way.  Fitment: The soft-cushioned headband on the headset can have its length adjusted to fit virtually any side head, and what's neat is there are numbered notches on the sliders, so I can precisely measure how much each side can be adjusted. Mine is currently set to 4 on each side, the smallest size being 0, which technically is not labeled since the lowest notch is 1, so I consider 0 the point where the sliders are entirely closed. The earpieces have the same soft cushioning that completely surround my ears, closing off all external sound and only allowing me to hear what comes out of the speakers on the headset. Some people say the headset pushes on some major pressure points around the ears, but I have not had this problem at all.  OVERALL: This is a very fine, very well-made product from Logitech. I have always regarded them very highly, as being one of the most prominent hardware manufacturers for any type of person, and they surely do not disappoint with the Logitech G930 wireless 7.1 gaming headset. Logitech certainly took many obvious and common ideas into consideration when designing the hardware as well as software for this marvelous piece of handiwork, and it shows.  I give this headset a rating of 9.8 out of 10. Keep up the amazing work, Logitech!  Amendments: While some people may find this headset's power save feature (automatically shut off headset after 15 minutes of no audio) annoying, I find it a life-saver. Considering the fact a headsetis intended to be used whenever there is audio, this isn't a nuisance at all but in fact it saves me having to worry about having the battery unintentionally drained if I set it down but leave it turned on.  Also, I wanted to leave a follow-up about the docking base's USB port. It won't make much of a difference to most people, but I noticed the opening for the port is somewhat thinner than most USB devices. It's the perfect size for the headset's dongle, but most other USB plugs really won't fit -- I've tried it with a cell phone charger, several flash drives, and none of them were able to fit securely and snugly down into the actual port. Like I said, not really a big deal, since it is intended for the dongle.

1594202842|2.0|This book is a tome dedicated to the author's self-worship and is loaded with self-indulgent, narcissistic musings. Her child-rearing postulations are based on subjective anecdotes laced with self-righteousness. This book failed to give me any useful insights into the nurturing of my children. Certainly, I will measure my daughters' \\"success\\" by more edified criteria than academic and musical prowess. My experience teaches me children from highly-regimented, disciplinarian homes grow up to become disaffected, controlling, and rebellious. Save your money and save your kids from the nightmarish upbringing the author advocates.
0802136834|5.0|this is a great book. if ever you are a beginner and want to learn more about the english history especially the Tudors then alison weir is the author for you. she is an amazing writer and the way she writes she brings the stories of the tudors to life. henry the VIII and his 6 wives was the first book that i read, and it will not be the last by alison weir. she goes to great detail and historical fact to bring the royal english ancestors back to life without it being dull or feel like its just a history book with dates and names. she allows you to get inside henry's head and into the mindset of each of his wives and  shows their strength,  power, emotion and heart for the king of england (no matter how crazy he was). in one simple word this book is just Brilliant!

0953104907|4.0|This one of the three highly recommended books I own on the subject & would strongly recommend it, if you don't already have it.  Nice foreward by Brian May (of Queen) and generally very good sections on design considerations (Chapter 3); mixing different styles you may have seen & like into your own design (Chapter 12) and installation of a tremolo system (Chapter 16).  While it is nice to have Melvyn go all the way through the construction of three differnt types of guitars (one of which is a bass) it was frustrating to not have a photo of any of the three finished guitars (at least it was for me).  Additionally, while I'm certain some will enjoy having the fretting tables contained in Appendix 1, I'm not certain why they were considered essential, since Melvyn covers how to set up a simple computer spreadsheet to very accurately calculate the same thing, such that any high school student cold do it at his school or home (would love to see the look on the teacher's face when the student announces he's setting up a spreadsheet to calculate guitar fret distances for a specified fretboard length, based on the harmonic frequecies of a vibrating guitar string).  Additionally, there are some things in the text that made me believe the concept of the book was seriously pared down during production to limit cost.  An example is Melvyn's reference in the section on finishing (Chapter 13) to the Telecaster-style guitar he makes in Chapter 10 in which he states (on page 146) it was finished in a \\"Gibson-style cherry sunburt\\"  That would be nice if we had any color photographs (there are none throughout the book) or even if we had a good photo of that finished guitar (which we don't).<br /><br />What makes this a valuable addition to you library is the large format, with good quality black & white photos printed on a good quality, slick-finish paper.  The information that is presented is also a good balance & source of \\"other ways\\" do to specific guitar-building activity presented in one of the other good texts on the subject.in one of the other good texts on the subject.
B004132HZS|5.0|The latest version of Sherlock Holmes is set in present day London. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson have been introduced by a mutual friend and are sharing a flat on Baker Street in London. Watson is the grounding force to Sherlock's mysterious and unpredictable crime-fighting ways. Our modern Sherlock Holmes is a \\"highly functional sociopath\\" unable to form normal friendships yet obsessed with crime solving. Sherlock doesn't work for the police but is called in as a sort of consulting detective when a case is hard to break. No one seems to like him but his long-suffering landlady.    This new BBC version is absolutely addictive. Sherlock's power of deduction is amazing. He notices the most minute detail and can immediately deduce a person's most secret details. He and Watson form the most unlikely of partnerships. The new Sherlock Holmes is abrasive, pompous, socially inept and not very likeable yet he is hard to resist.     Benedict Cumberbatch gives a completely different take on Sherlock Holmes. He's young, anti-social, sexually ambivalant and totally fascinating. Martin Freeman is the older and wiser and more grounded Dr. Watson. Holmes and Watson are the odd couple of the crime fighting scene. It's not clear why Watson so quickly attaches himself to Holmes beyond the love of adventure.    The writing is fresh and crisp. The flashes of information in Sherlock's mind as they are shown on screen explain his remarkable powers of deduction. The stories can get a bit convoluted at times as several side stories intermingle, but this adds to the fun. The big disappointment with Series One is that there are only 3 episodes, but they do run long and there is plenty of Sherlock and Watson to see. I can't wait for Season Two.

B004WPIJ4I|4.0|The Fame Monster is back with another \\"shocker\\" and this time it's compelled me to write a review. Production wise this track is up there with anything else, melody and harmony wise I like it up until the \\"holy fool\\" chorus section kicks in when it suddenly sounds trite and too poppy for what's come before. Personally I would have preferred it to stay dark and industrial throughout. Of course this is supposed to be contrasting and perhaps ironic, maybe cynical; I understand all that but the shift in musical gears isn't totally working for me. Still, listening objectively, as a song it all works and has hooks. What's central to my perspective is: this has been done before so it's not shocking. Madonna went this way and used religion vs sex as the mainstay of her shock value throughout the 80's and beyond. U2 got tired of preaching and put on the horns and went ironic in the 90's. To me those artists already did this routine better and so much that the cross imagery is fairly played out now. I can't help noticing Gaga is once again using Madonna's and perhaps even U2's ideas to sell herself. While this might have been interesting had it come first, and it's a relatively good track, it's nothing on \\"Like a Prayer\\" which will always be the Mother of all tracks in this direction.

Digital copy is great for the handheld devices or computer if you don't want to carry the disc with you.  I use the blu ray one at home.  The DVD copy is good for car DVD players or you can give it away.  I gave my DVD copy away to my sister since she has a young daughter that will eventually watch it.  The 3D version I'm going to hold onto since I plan on up grading to a 3D TV when they get the technology down a bit better without the headaches from watching to long or if they can eliminate the use of 3D glasses.  For the price you paying and what you are getting you can't go wrong.  If you wanted to have 2 other people in your family go in on the price and split up the movies and you can have a great disney movie for real cheap then.

The flow of the book was a little disjointed but the action was swift and not drawn out and hard to understand. The characters were my favorite part of these books. I liked Clary she was so real. There was a ton of violence in these books, I think the phrase blood spurting, splattering, oozing, dropping, falling was used on every sixth page. There were a lot of religious swear words so if that bothers you, you might not want to pick this up.

B000VCUX68|5.0|The Hives are one of those bands that should have been a lot more famous than they are. When the Swedish band emerged in 2001, they came out around the time as other buzzed about fellow indie rock bands- like The White Stripes and The Strokes. They had a huge hit with the song \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" from their album \\"Veni Vedi Vicious\\"- a recording that had been out for a year before the song was even released as a single. Unfortunately, their American label London Records had closed its doors shortly after the success of the song. By the time they released their follow-up \\"Tyrannosaurus Hives\\" on their new label Interscope Records, the album came and went with little fanfare. So, they regrouped a few years later and released \\"The Black And White Album\\" in 2007, a record that's as fun as it is quirky. Most of the production was handled by Dennis Herring- who also produced Modest Mouse's breakthrough 2004 effort \\"Good News For People Who Love Bad News\\", with the exceptions of the Jacknife Lee produced \\"Hey Little World\\" and The Neptunes helmed \\"Well All Right!\\" and \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.\\".<br /><br />The album starts off with the uptempo \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" in which lead singer Howlin' Pete Almqvist gives off a Mick Jagger vibe. On the catchy \\"Try It Again\\", the band gets assistance from- believe it or not- the cheerleaders from the University Of Mississippi (!!!!). They channel The Ramones on \\"You Got It All...Wrong\\" while they sing rather joyful about ending a relationship on the songs \\"Won't Be Long\\" and \\"Return The Favour\\". There's a couple of dance rock numbers on here, such as the aforementioned \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.\\" as well as \\"Giddy Up\\". They sing the best song about being lazy on the chuckle inducing \\"Square One Here I Come\\". On \\"You Dress Up For Armageddon\\", they make a mockery of a completely annoying person and close the album with the heavy guitar sound of \\"Bigger Hole To Fill\\". Most of the songs by The Hives have a comedic slant and are sometimes nonsensical, so it's hard to tell at times whether the band is being serious or not. One thing is for certain though- they have no problem in having fun and wanting people to dance.hard to tell at times whether the band is being serious or not.

B004L49K20|5.0|If I told you this was the best album Duran Duran ever recorded, would you think I was crazy? OF COURSE you would.... and I'm sure I'll change my mind in a year or two.... but it's good! It's so much better than it has any right to be.....<br /><br />My favorite is The Man Who Stole a Leopard. My least favorite is the title track. But it's all good. And check out David Lynch's video concert of the new album. I hope they make that available to buy. It's pretty fantastic too.<br /><br />I'll say this with confidence. It's the best album anyone has released since Grinderman's 'Grinderman 2' last year.

030746363X|4.0|I like Ferris's stuff - he keeps it short, introduces personal anecdotes, and does a lot of personal experimentation (thus encouraging you to do the same).    Its a buffet - try the things that look good and see what you think.    Obviously you should check his claims - luckily we have this thing called the Internet that has anecdotes from lots of people and reports from \\"authorities\\" - I like to weigh them together and then decide whether or not I want to try it out myself.    None of this stuff originated with him - he is simply reporting the claims and his tests of them.    I am trying out a couple of \\"his\\" ideas - its always fun to find a book that can re-energize your body re-shaping goals.
0316069353|4.0|Connelly gets more and more interesting with this excellent novel. It is the sort of book which will occupy three or four evening's reading. The treatment of evidence  in the case plays well into suspicions current concerning the forclosure mess which plagues our economy. The set up - the tanking economy and Haller's shift of practice to civil law from criminal defense = plays well into the climax of the novel which suggests the presence of a sinister element behind the forclosure frenzy. The success at money making by the banks and associated corporations, while suffering is general is more than plausable. Connely seems far ahead of the curve in revealing the shoddy practices of the forclosure mills and gives a clear picture of the megabanks continuing to \\"keep their hands clean\\" by parcelling out the dirty work. The courtroom procedue aspects of the novel are precisely detailed as well as the ethical practices of the opposing lawyers. My one dislike is the addition of the final two chapters. While not wanting to give away a twist to the conclusion, I think we would all be happier with the ultimate question of guilt left in the air.
1936719010|5.0|When \\"Do The Work\\" landed on my Kindle, I opened it and plowed through it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down... it was as if Pressfield had a window into my life. I have already developed a game plan to help me get un-stuck on some important projects I've been avoiding because of the Resistance.    Many books that will be lumped on the bookshelf next to this one in stores will be all about trying to get you to think differently. \\"Do The Work\\" will not make you think... it will make you stop thinking and start doing.  It belongs in a category all its own.    I would, and will recommend this book to anyone who is or wants to be a creator or a difference maker.
044654759X|3.0|Normally, I am a Nicholas Sparks fan, but Safe Haven while it was not his traditional love story, fell flat for me.  While Katie and Alex are both endearing characters, the story is over-the-top predictable and not suspenseful in the least.  Although I appreciate a different spin on love (we all do fall in love in different ways), I was a bit perplexed as to why Alex with all that he had been through continued to pursue Katie.  Staying true to form, this story takes place in North Carolina and takes you on a journey through love, loss, and a bit of redemption.  The story line moved a bit slow for me and was the first Nicholas Sparks book that I contemplated not finishing as I already figured how it would conclude.

1401228801|3.0|Fables has seriously overrun its obvious ending at this point, proving  that Bill Willingham wasn't planning to write the story of a glorious victory, but instead to continue the story of how a bunch of rarely-unified people muddled through all of the troubles that the world could throw at them. (Well, a few of them haven't managed to muddle all the way through -- there has been a mild body count along the way -- but the central characters of Fables have mostly been safe, and look to remain so.) And this volume sees Fables returning to its own story after the forced \\"Great Fables Crossover,\\" which served primarily to drag in the main-series characters in to clean up the tangled plots of the daughter series Jack of Fables.<br /><br />So WITCHES begins with what amounts to a gigantic \\"anyway...\\" and dives backward into the history of our new Big Bad, the Dark Man, explaining how he was captured by the empire of the previous Big Bad, in a single-issue story, \\"Boxing Days,\\" with art by Jim Fern and Craig Hamilton. It's a decent story in its own right, but serves primarily to litter crumbs in the path of the main story, explaining where things will be going for the next ten or twenty or fifty issues.<br /><br />The title story then follows, which originally filled up five issues and has art by the main Fables artist, Mark Buckingham. It moves the ball down the field a healthy amount, and begins to incorporate those bread crumbs from \\"Boxing Days\\" as it sets a number of major Fables characters off on new paths (such as \\"Frau Totenkinder,\\" current head of the Fabletown witches) and brings others in (such as Ozma, future head of those witches). It's all good stuff, but it's all middle at this point, and it will take a while to decide whether this particular hunk of middle is working as well as it should -- probably until we get within hailing distance of an ending, I expect.<br /><br />And then this collection ends with what was a two-issue story -- \\"Out to the Ball Game\\" -- with art by David Lapham, in which King Flycatcher deals with a threat to the peace of his still-new land, far out in the former worlds of the Empire. This is a complete story, but it's one part two-finger-exercise -- aping \\"Casey at the Bat\\" -- and six parts boilerplate \\"it's tough to be the king,\\" so it's pleasant rather than particularly impressive.<br /><br />All in all, Fables is still chugging along professionally, telling new stories out of the cloth its been weaving for ninety issues now. It's not as exciting and new as it once was, and there is a certain undertone of and-here's-another-damn-thing to it, but it's solidly entertaining and occasionally inventive.am, in which King Flycatcher deals with a threat to the peace of his still-new land, far out in the former worlds of the Empire.

B00000255F|5.0|As a kid I lived in a working class neighborhood in New Jersey in the 70's, and this album was the soundtrack for many magical things in the eyes of a young girl. Boomboxes played Born to Run while I played Little League, crushed on boys, took drags of a cigarette under the boardwalk at Seaside Heights in the summer and wondered if I was pretty when I looked in the rear view mirror while riding in the back seat of my mother's Dodge Duster.<br /><br />But then the 80's rolled around and my mother moved us to NYC and New Jersey became associated with a lack of imagination and Joe Piscopo's Saturday Night Live skit, &#34;I'm from Joisey. Are you from Joisey?&#34; Getting my ears pierced in the Paramus, NJ mall at age six  no longer seemed like a badge of bravery. Sharing memories of family BBQ's in my grandmother's back yard wasn't cool, I found out. As a typically insecure teen now in NYC, I disowned that part of my past although secretly I yearned to move back and plotted to run away to where I belonged.<br /><br />Fast forward to two weeks ago when I bought this CD. I've never disavowed my blue collar heart despite my white collar dreams, and being that we now live in a culture of excess, McMansions and the belief that the working class life is some kind of failure, I really craved getting back to my innocent NJ roots. Listening to this album brings back all of the working class fairy dust magic that these songs once gave to me. There's angst, yearning, striving and escaping but never do I feel like I want to disown the struggle. Unlike the get-rich-or-die-trying attitude or the hipster values of anything soft and tender is kitschy and embraced as irony, this is a genuine emotional appeal to run towards a real glory that is won inside the heart.<br /><br />I still live in a working class neighborhood although not in NJ. Someday maybe I'll make it back. Born to Run assures me that I've made it because I am happy and have earned all that I won, even though I don't live on the other side of the tracks. The beauty of the lyrics and melodies of Born to Run are for anyone who never gives up hope and takes pride in the human struggle of working for a living with wholesome and rewarding escapes.cks.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|At first I was skeptical, but this turned out to be such an amazing book! I never write reviews and I had to share my thoughts. This book has a wonderful story from start to finish with historical and scientific references which was heart warming and a breath of fresh air to me as a history lover!! The references added so much more to the story about Diana, a relatively young witch, and Matthew a vampire who has lived through major historical events that Diana has only read about. It is not just another book about vampires or witches, but a story about strong, well educated people that have an amazing mutual respect for each other who just happen to be a vampire and a witch. This couple is not only trying to find a way to be together but they are also trying to uncover the mystery regarding a manuscript that may hold the answer that all creatures are looking for about their origins and existance. In the process and in opposition to the Congregation, they have started to bring vampires, witches and daemons together to join their effort. This has become one of my favorites!!!
B000001FQ4|4.0|this album is widely regarded as mediocre in the overall thin lizzy canon. it is different from their previous albums in that the new line up(and now considered core line up) of roberston/gorham is together for the first time, so the guitar chops are there. it differs in what was to come, not rocking as hard as jailbreak or black rose. there are still some outstanding tracks on here that stand on their own, like she knows and sha la la. this being said, night life does not possess the quintessential lizzy sound that most have come to know them by. the production is very polished and orchestrated which changes the band's complexion, for better or for worse. however, if you go into this album without expectations (of what lizzy is suppose to sound like), it becomes a rather enjoyable musical experience.
B003M0H4NG|5.0|Conceived and recorded in late summer 1969, `Bitches Brew' marked a radical repositioning in Miles' musical direction as he for the first time full-bloodedly embraced both free-form jazz and synthesized electronic sound. The result is intense, complex and mysterious, multiply-textured, full of dissonance and dark, brooding magic: the very antithesis of easy listening. It's not pop; it's unlikely to inspire smiles or foot-tapping, and doesn't work as background music. It's insistent and demands the listener's full attention, which if offered will be lavishly rewarded.<br /><br />If you know and love `Birth of the Cool' or `Kind of Blue' or even Miles' more experimental adventures with Gil Evans' arrangements, then you should be warned that none of those essentially structured and harmony- or modal-based improvisations will prepare you for B-B. The musical forms tried out on `In a Silent Way' give indications of the direction Miles was headed, but IaSW is neither as daring nor as complex as B-B, and explores a landscape far less richly textured, confusing and intense. In 1970 B-B proved controversial and divided fans and critics alike, proving too much for traditionalists. 40 years on we can now see that B-B was groundbreaking music, and a kind of landmark. It's really, really good.<br /><br />Almost all the pieces (with the exception of the original album closer `Sanctuary') are grounded on predominantly hard-driving minor-key rhythms with multiple-percussion and insistent bass lines. The usual showcase-solos to give episodic structure to the melody are almost completely absent. Instead the virtuoso ensemble of Miles' trumpet, Wayne Shorter's soprano and alto sax, bass clarinet (a nice touch indeed), John McLaughlin's guitar and multiple-keyboards dart in and out of focus with a bar here, four bars there; overlaying the rhythm in a restless multi-participant conversation to create a wall of sound often dissonant, at times intense, but collectively building up to something astounding. Miles often leads the pack, sometimes takes a back seat, and in the number `John McLaughlin' he isn't even part of the action, but takes a tea break.<br /><br />Many reviewers point out that B-B is not for everyone. It certainly has never had, nor ever will have, the universally-acceptable lounge appeal of `Kind of Blue.' However if you're open-minded, willing to give this demanding and adventurous music your whole attention and crank up the volume, you'll be in for a rare treat and will be transported to a land mysterious and strange.<br /><br />B-B is definitely one of Miles' top five recordings and an important milestone in his career. Even the cover art is striking, and perfect for the music. In retrospect perhaps not quite as revolutionary or unique as it seemed at the time, nevertheless its greatness remains undiminished. You can hear the influence of B-B spilling over into the more experimental rock music of the early 1970s: some of the `Krautrock' wave, Frank Zappa's more chaotic creations and particularly John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra which almost achieved the kind of mainstream-pop breakthrough which Miles never came close to after 1970.<br /><br />For anyone seriously interested in exploring the evolution of jazz, B-B is indispensable. You might not like it first time round (like most listeners, I found it hard going to begin with) but persist and you may, like so many of us, eventually come to love and appreciate its complexity, stark beauty and rare intensity.ng.

B002ZG9800|5.0|This movie was better than I expected. I thought it was a great comedy/drama and (dare I say) romance.  Yes, I would say this was a great romance. I felt it, I loved it. I guess some of the reviewers couldnt really get with the idea of the two men in love. But I got it, I thought it was sweet the way Jim Carey's Character and Ewan McGregors character fell in love. I especially loved the scene when Jim got taken away and Ewan ran out to the yard to tell him that he loved him.  I seriously loved this movie. I thought it would be offensive -the way certain films love to make gay characters just look ridiculous, but this was fantastic and funny. Jim Carey was still Jim Carey, and Ewan McGregor -who I love as an actor, still used his phenomenal talents.  I would classify this as a gay love story -one reviewer gave this movie only one star because he didnt dig the gay aspect. The fact that it is based on a true story is hilarious, and yet tragic. This guy was a genius. I recommend this movie just for the sheer entertainment of watching how this guy kept escaping prison. So anyway, GREAT MOVIE, I bought it after I Netflix'd it and I cant wait for it to arrive in the mail so I can watch it again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm leaving this positive review here amidst all the negative ratings people are giving to an unreleased product. I find it stupid and disrespectful, but it is typical fanboy behavior. I love Star Wars, I love the original films as much a I love the re releases. Why? Because Lucas vision is complete, regardless of his alterations, which were his original intentions anyways. I don't see the point in moaning and whining about this and give this product a bad reputation. I can't wait to own this complete saga on Blu Ray and hopefully George Lucas will release the original versions on HD as well.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Some impressions.  \\"Blade Runner\\" was a decade or two before it's time, yet being nearly a perfect film, it remains a timeless classic.  My preference remains with the theatrical version.  The voice-over by Ford is well-written and adds another layer/dimension, as well as some much-needed explanation.  The director's cut (without the narrative) seems vacuous.  Whichever version, the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film are tedious.  How many times do we see Leon's dialog with the Tyrell rep and the shooting?  Leon was not my favorite character and his hesitant answers to the rep are not really suspenseful or entertaining.  Within a few seconds you get the idea that Leon is a dim wit, a nervous dim wit, but the scene goes on and on.  This is followed with Deckard and the precinct head detective -- again watching Leon's less than spectacularly surprising shooting.  The same scene is thrown at us again as Deckard is driving/flying around.  Once I get past the basically crappy beginning, I'm glued in.  Harrison Ford is very good in this film but is eclipsed by Rutger Hauer's portrayal of Roy Baty (the IMDB shows the character as Roy Batty but this is incorrect -- as displayed in the novel and in the movie.  Given my last name, this was something I couldn't help but notice.)  Hauer's performance is mesmerizing.  A tremendous amount of credit also goes to Sean Young's performance as Rachel.  An amazingly beautiful woman (in my humble estimation), Ridley Scott's framing/lighting, etc., emphasize her femininity/fragility and an odd combination of near angelic innocence mixed with astute intelligence and keen perception.  Replicant or not Sean Young convincingly plays the type of woman that any man (well, almost any man, I suppose) would die for.  She's not just a \\"pleasure unit.\\" Rachel is sophisticated, complex, sensual.  Probably, she is conceived to be an idealized woman, a kind of \\"Stepford Wife\\" minus the zombie attributes.  Not only is Sean Young stunning in appearance, she also has the most feminine, soft, gentle-sounding voice I've ever heard.  I could listen to her recite \\"The Iliad\\" (or anything else) ad infinitum and remain transfixed.  The addition of Rachel in the story is imperative.  \\"She is the business.\\"  The selection of Sean Young to play this role was a masterstroke.  Sean Young had a few halfway decent roles after \\"Blade Runner,\\" but this will remain her crowning jewel.  Last news I remember of Sean Young is her going after the role of Catwoman in Tim Burton's second entree in the early Batman franchise.  I think she came to the audition in a full-on Catwoman costume of some kind.  Somehow this incident (if true) translated into Young being a wacko.  That's Hollywood for you.  Her role in David Lynch's strange interpretation of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" was also right on the mark.  I think all actors are a little bit \\"nutty.\\"  I think they have to be in order to subsume their own identity and fall into character.  I simply wish that Sean Young had been given greater opportunities.  Like so many other truly beautiful actresses, she seems to have vanished.  Unless an actress is able to ascend to the Meryl Streep or Cate Blanchett level, they are evidently excreted from the biz once the bloom of youth fades.  Compare this with the longevity of male actors -- both highly talented and semi-talented.rance, she also has the most feminine, soft, gentle-sounding voice I've ever heard.

B002RKSZWG|2.0|Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.  My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P... but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?
B004KSQN7C|3.0|i do not consider myself a big britney fan. i am more of a madonna fan. this cd sounds like either one of them could have made it...well, not vocally, but lyrically and musically. when i heard madonna's \\"revolver,\\" i thought it was a britney throw away. i started like britney with her circus cd. i think circus is better than femme fatale, but femme fatale is pretty good. the best song is \\"don't keep me waiting.\\" i am confused why \\"hold it against me\\" and \\"till the world ends\\" were the first two singles when there are some better ones on the cd, in my opinion. (and i have yet to hear them on any radio station in my area, so it must be a big city station or the dance charts they are hits on.) the best songs on the cd are the four additional ones on the deluxe edition. i like \\"big fat bass\\" even though the intro with will.i.am just seems to keep going on and on, but once you get pass that it's a good song. the only song i dislike is \\"gasoline.\\" the lyrics are just amaturish.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I loved this book! Once I started reading, I could not stop.<br />It has a similar plot line to Sense & Sensibility, but S&S moves very sloooooww. P&P was much more enjoyable & interesting. I plan on reading it again soon.<br />Because of the era it was written, some of the language is hard to understand & some conversations in the book, I had no clue what they were talking about. But overall it was understandable.<br />As some people have stated, I did notice a lot of typos in the free Kindle version. It was annoying to have such a thing, but it was free & didnt make me love the story any less.

From one page to the next, I kept looking and saying \\"yes, I could do that\\" and \\"ahhh, that's how she does that.\\"    Will it influence my work?  Yes and now I realize that it will be a good thing.    Excellent book for beginners, intermediate and advanced bead embroidery artists.

In our experience, District Judges who hear such cases have often been members of APIL, or are very familiar with its work.  Therefore, it's not surprising that this volume has become known as the definitive guide to this particularly challenging area of law and is highly recommended to practitioners who represent survivors of abuse, notably those who seek fair and just compensation for what has happened to them.<br /><br />If you are a practitioner in this area, the Guide presents all the information you need to pursue compensation for clients who have experienced suffering from abuse, whether physical, sexual or emotional.  Virtually all aspects of this area of law are covered, together with all related legislation.<br /><br />The ten chapters start with the background and history of abuse claims, followed by a detailed explication of the statutory framework.  Subsequent chapters deal with a range of topics, including causes of action...causation and damage...claims against the church...criminal injuries compensation...evidence...and finally, funding and enforcement.<br /><br />It's the final chapter, with its startling observations on enforcement and its pitfalls, which may well be of particular interest, especially to practitioners who do not routinely practice in this area and therefore require the guidance which this book so amply provides.<br /><br />Here is a scholarly and thorough treatment of this specialist subject written with clarity and humanity by Elizabeth-Anne Gumbel QC, Justin Levinson, Malcolm Johnson and Richard Scorer.  It is worth noting that this new second edition has been extensively updated and revised to include the latest developments in this difficult field.<br /><br />To facilitate further research, the book contains lengthy tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, together with appendix plus useful index.  The publication date is March 2011 and the work remains a special friend as a practical and authoritative guide for practitioners in this difficult area of law.It is worth noting that this new second edition has been extensively updated and revised to include the latest developments in this difficult field.

1594484805|5.0|Um livro sensacional!      Sem a menor sombra de dúvida, Motivação 3.0 de Daniel Pink é um dos melhores livros sobre Pessoas e Trabalho e o que as motiva.      Não se engane pelo título em português. Com essa \\"onda\\" de títulos 2.0, 3.0, que no final muitas vezes só servem para divulgar o livro, acaba aparecendo muita coisa sem valor.  Sem dúvida, NÃO é o caso de Drive - título original em inglês, algo como \\"dirija\\" - do conhecido Daniel H. Pink. Suas obras anteriores - \\"O Cérebro do Futuro\\" (2007) e \\"A Revolução do Lado Direito do Cérebro\\" (2005) já o colocaram no rol dos bons autores de Desenvolvimento de Pessoas.      Também não se trata de um livro de auto-ajuda com aquelas frases motivadoras genéricas. Longe disso.      Daniel Pink analisa uma série de estudos e experimentos no campo da motivação humana e conclui que, no mundo moderno, as técnicas de motivação do tipo Recompensa-Punição (ou \\"Cenoura-Chicote\\" como ele define) já não servem mais, pelo contrário, ele expõe uma série de situações reais e estudos sobre o assunto, que provam que o binômio Recompensa-Punição pode até prejudicar o desempenho e a motivação intrínseca de cada ser humano.  O autor faz um paralelo com os sistemas operacionais de computadores, definindo:      .Motivação 1.0 - Impulso biológico. A boa e velha base da pirâmide motivacional de Maslow: a necessidade de sobrevivência, comer, beber, abrigar-se, descansar.      .Motivação 2.0 - Impulso por motivadores externos ao ser: reagir às Recompensas e Punições, \\"Cenoura e Chicote\\", o esquema \\"se - então\\": \\"se você fizer a lição-de-casa então pode brincar...\\", \\"se não fizer a meta então não ganha a comissão...\\", etc.      .Motivação 3.0 -  o \\"Terceiro Impulso\\", por Motivadores Intrínsecos: a paixão, a vontade própria de realizar, independentemente de ser recompensado por fazê-lo ou punido por não fazê-lo.        O Autor explica que, diferente de outros ramos,  no campo daMotivação Humana, existe uma distância muito grande entre o que a Ciência já sabe e o que de fato se faz na prática. Daniel narra uma série de experimentos que nos provam o quanto as práticas motivacionais amplamente utilizadas hoje em dia, tipicamente Motivação 2.0, mais atrapalham que ajudam. E que nesse nosso novo mundo, novas práticas alinhadas com a Motivação Intrínseca - a Motivação 3.0 - são necessárias.      Segundo Daniel Pink, as práticas da Motivação 3.0 devem contemplar 3 elementos essenciais:      .Automonia - a possibilidade de dirigir (drive!) a própria tarefa, o próprio trabalho, a própria vida. O antigo paradigma militar da administração científica de chão-de-fábrica de \\"Comando-e-Controle\\", precisa dar lugar a mais autonomia do executor. Comando-e-Controle, Cenoura-Chicote, Recompensa-Punição funciona apenas para tarefas estritamente físicas e cansativas. Mas isso, em nosso mundo está ficando cada vez mais a cargo de máquinas.       .Excelência - vontade de ser cada vez melhor em algo relevante.       .Propósito - fazer a tarefa em nome de algo maior. Cada vez mais, nos tornamos maximizadores de propósito, não simplesmente maximizadores de lucro.      Outro ponto muito interessante do livro é sua estrutura moderna. Tipicamente os livros são compostos pelos capítulos desenvolvendo seu conteúdo e depois se tem uma lista de fontes de citações, referências bibliográficas e ok.  Em Motivação 3.0, Daniel Pink, após terminar a parte teórica expositiva, dedica uma parte extra a um \\"kit de ferramentas\\" de Motivação 3.0:      .Estratégias para despertar sua motivação.  .Formas de melhorar sua Empresa, seu Escritório ou sua Equipe.  .Fórmula para remunerar as Pessoas.  .Idéias para ajudar nossos Filhos.  .Livros essenciais.  .Pensadores que sabem das coisas.  .Dicas para continuar motivado.      E ainda, uma recapitulação super original:   .Síntese para Twitter: como resumir o livro em 140 caracteres (genial!).  .Síntese para um Coquetel: para explicar numa roda de amigos, um parágrafo em um minuto.  .Síntese por Capítulo: um parágrafo para cada.      Sem dúvida, MUITO BOM!      :)< / >.

Strategies to help clients minimize their exposure to tax and penalties, for example, are prominently featured.  The widest possible range of transactions involving land is covered, including development, corporate transactions, trusts and the administration of estates. Legislation is minutely analysed and case law rigorously reviewed in 600 pages, 18 chapters and 4 important appendices.<br /><br />Areas covered in the chapters of detailed, scrupulously footnoted text include chargeable transactions... taxable events... exemptions and reliefs... options and rights of pre-emption... leases... trusts... estates of deceased persons... partnerships... corporate  transactions... liability for the tax... filing returns... and of course, much more besides.  The chapter on HMRC powers and enforcement is particularly worthy of note.<br /><br />The book is a mine of information if you need to do further research. There are lengthy tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, together with the four appendices, including the very handy Appendix D:  `Completing the Tax Return' plus useful index.

Why would she bring a balloon to the garage to get the victim to \\"look up\\" so she could conk him on the top of the head? Did she think that risky tactic would divert suspicion from herself? Seems like a lot of extra trouble for very little gain.    2. Why would she toss the hammer into a bush to get rid of it!? She had a bag to carry it home. Why not dispose of it properly? It HAD to have forensic evidence on it!    3. Why would she wear gardening shoes to the murder and then casually put them back into the garage? (OK maybe slightly plausible).    4. Why drag the Aparizio red herring though the whole story and then just walk away from him?    And finally...  5. Why would Mickey Haller, a guy who works out of his car, has no office, staff, or other responsibilities EVER want to run for DA? Totally not plausible!    I really liked the book until the end of the trial and then was left feeling annoyed and dissatisfied.

0452287022|5.0|Tracy Chevalier was obviously drawn to the beauty of one of Vermeer's more famous paintings, of a young maid with a pearl earring. But unlike the many viewers who were similarly fascinated, that attraction became an obsession. She wondered about the circumstances that surrounded the painting, could find very little of substance in the historical record, and therefore took the known \\"crumbs\\" of facts, and performed major research into the life and times of mid-17th Century Dutch life. With this basis, she utilized that often sought, but oh so elusive gift: a seemingly magical ability of a creative writer to weave a well-told story that is authentic to the human condition.<br /><br />For sure, power is one of those conditions. The power of a famous painter with a substantial household over a semi-illiterate country maid who has recently been employed. And there is the countervailing power; that of beauty. And the need, yes, even the obsession to capture that beauty, in the perfect light, for all time. Chevalier does \\"nuance\\"; her viewpoint is not the narrow view of one or the other, tainted with modern political correctness. Rather, she depicts a more symbiotic relationship whose reflection is there for us to enjoy, more than three centuries later.<br /><br />And it reads so true. I said that it was \\"authentic,\\" and how can anyone truly know, of private events over three centuries removed? And particularly when there are so many fraudulent novels, memoirs, et al. that are published concerning people and events in our own lifetime. So, it really is a judgment call. Given the sum total of one's experience with human interactions, does this appear to be a highly likely scenario? In my judgment, certain yes.<br /><br />I recently learned that Rembrandt, another brilliant Dutch painter, created a similar painting, of HIS maid, eight years before Vermeer, but have never seen a discussion on a possible connection, and would welcome reader comments. The review on Rembrandt's paintings is [[ASIN:0810915642 Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn: Paintings from Soviet museums]]<br /><br />Chevalier writes well, and it is such a pleasure to read since she eschews the hokum so many novelist believe is essential in order to produce a \\"best-seller.\\"  It remains a tribute to a diminishing sector of the reading public that it became one anyway.

0399250573|5.0|Most Epic Alex Riser book ever. Again MI6 pulled him him in and everyone he knew was in danger again. The book was fast-paced, had interesting twists and the awkwardness between Alex and Jack also added to the loss.   And I love the way Horowitz killed off Alex, even if he recovers he'll never be able to work for MI6 or the CIA without the horrible memory of Jack dying. Though I was hoping that everyone he loved died, be bit more exciting but I have rarely read a book which came so close to killing off the main character. All I can say is absolutely brilliant Horowitz and R.I.P Alex.

B001LOU6ZS|2.0|With Gary Lyons(Foreigner, Aerosmith) handling production duties on this outing, UFO keeps the party raging on this release. Unfortunately, they're running out of steam and this is vindicated by my fears on the earlier release No Place To Run which, while a solid effort and the first with Paul Chapman on the six string, started showing signs of indifference and sub-par quality to songwriting. Mechanix follows this formulamatic approach to the hilt as the songwriting really dips badly. Neil Carter's presence is much more upfront here and some numbers work: Dreaming(Carter/Mogg),Doing It All For You and We Belong to the Night(Way/Carter/Mogg); these tracks offer UFO's classic sound which had been stamped on the previous Lights Out and Obsession releases and these tunes are successful in maintaining UFO's power rock style. The other tracks are simply stabbing the AOR market for commercial appeal: Let It Rain, Terri, Back Into My Life, and an indifferent cover of Eddie Cochran's Somethin' Else, that really drives home the fact that UFO have lost some credibility and substance within their songwriting and arrangements. There are a pair of numbers that offer up a bit of old UFO muscle, notably Feel It and You'll Get Love; unfortunately these songs are much too \\"by numbers\\" and really don't offer anything of sustaining substance to stregthen this collection.<br /><br />Its no suprise that Pete Way would jump ship after the tour in support of this sub-par effort and then after another record(Making Contact) what was left of the group would utterly implode. Anyone who's looking to check out UFO should avoid this album as it does not represent the better qualities that the band had to offer. Start with Lights Out or Phenomenon and if you're that intrigued, you could take a chance on this one, but, there's better Chapman-era albums out there(see my review for The Wild, The Willing and the Innocent) besides this indifferent and pale effort. 2 stars
0767903862|4.0|I really don't need a book to convince to travel somewhere, but after deciding that I wanted to go to Australia next I grabbed this book and the Lonely Planet guide to mix it up.  On my last trip out of the country I met a single-serving friend on the flight back that highly recommended I read any of Bill Bryson's books; so a year later I took her up on the recommendation and purchased this after reading reviews on books about Australia.    I like comedy with my travel writing and this guy is kind of like a self-effacing comedian.  He explains his travels in detail, warning you where not to go, what not to touch, the history of an area and a culture, and all with a humorous touch.    I would recommend it to anyone who wants to travel to Oz, expand their knowledge of the place, or just read a funny, well-written narrative.

B003UESJHE|5.0|On the face of it, the premise for this film shouldn't make a great film. Summarize this as the runner-up for the King of England(Prince George) has an impossible stutter and his wife (Princess Elizabeth) encourages the reluctant prince to seek help from a failed actor/self-identified speech therapist named Lionel Logue. However, when you put this story within the context of a couple larger occurences of monumental importance this film comes together.<br />In the background is the soon-to-be crowned King (Edward VIII) who gives up his kingdom 'for the woman I love' and the emerging threat of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi Party. Suddenly the need for a leader who can inspire the confidence of his countrymen becomes important.<br />This film works slowly in setting its groundwork with brilliant performances by Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham-Carter and a sharp script that progresses the plot as it involves the viewer in the personal story as well as the bigger story. The dynamic between the prince(Firth) and Logue(Rush) as their characters' relationship develops makes this match almost as interesting as the one forged between Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan. I appreciated the strong sense of the historic dynamic being blended with the simple story of a stutterer. While the Duke of Windsor has always been a figure of much speculation, this puts a face on the 'default' king and possibly explains why even today the English puts so much stock in having a figurehead royal family.<br />Overall, this is a great movie which has a strong script, great performances, beautiful photography, and an overall vintage feel to it that puts it into historic perspective.
B001LF347E|5.0|This high-gloss reimagining of the King Arthur legend combines many elements of the original with the best of a modern teen drama, losing no adventure in the union.  By focusing on Arthur and Merlin coming of age, the creative team presents interesting tension between medieval and modern sensibilities.  And unlike Thomas Malory's classic, which reads like an outline, this version of the Matter of Britain feels both complete and detailed.    Angel Coulby as young Guinevere probably stands out most among an amazing ensemble.  Presenting the future queen as a servant, subject to class derision, opens the story to options it may continue to explore in future seasons.  Colin Morgan's awkward, affable, but secretive Merlin makes a good contrast to Bradley James' outsized Arthur.  Only Katie McGrath's Morgana seems underdeveloped, mainly used as a contrast to Anthony Head's traditionalist King Uther.    The series' episodic structure gives characters multiple dynamic opportunities to test their mettle and develop into maturity.  For instance, over the arc of this season, Arthur develops humility and a willingness to sacrifice himself for those under his authority.  Merlin, by contrast, learns discretion, and perhaps even more important, the art of doing right for reasons that don't involve recognition.  These lessons, while not revolutionary, at least make good drama.    Playful, energetic, and brash, this series probably won't reinvent Arthurian mythology from the ground up, but it certainly makes a good contemporary addition to the tradition.  By grabbing ahold of minor traditional details and expanding or upending them into one-hour episodes, it beautifully unpacks the mythology while creating a series that feels new.  Whether you want food for thought or popcorn TV, this series may fit your bill.

The grammatical errors (\\"He lay the book down on the table\\") word repetitions (characters always wave their hands dismissively), and punctuation mistakes are ridiculous.      I'm only up to p. 350 or so, and amazed that we're only now moving away from the University. And I was astounded that when Kvothe finally does set off for Vintas, after 350 or so pages of extremely detailed exploits at the University, his adventures on his journey east are condensed into TWO PARAGRAPHS! Here's the second one: \\"In brief, there was a storm, piracy, treachery, and shipwreck .... It also goes without saying that i did a great many things, some heroic, some ill-advised, some clever and audacious.\\"    Couldn't we have had a little more about these, and a little less farting around in the Fishery?       All that said, I will definitely finish the book -- I love the world, and admire the author's powers of invention.
0879309210|5.0|This book is an easy read if you are into guitars. It has D.I.Y. sections and in depth sections. It gives a better understanding of guitars and what makes them work. It covers both electric and acoustic guitars. See if that guitar is worth $4000 by checking intonation, fretboard curvature, string height, etc. It explains how to make adjustments to a guitar (make that $700 guitar have the string action of a $4000 guitar). I highly recommend this book if you care about stuff like that. Made me want to be a guitar luthier with the practice I gotten so far on my guitars. Nice DVD with video explanations for many tasks(nice if you learn better from video than reading). Dan Erlewine is very good at explaining things.
B004X4RU9I|4.0|I had long anticipated the release of this film based upon the enjoyment I had for the first IP Man. Number 2 was not a good as number 1 but hardly a boring movie. It seemed to filmed in the traditional setting of the 70's vintage Kung Fu movies such as the usual poverty stricken town with gang skirmishes in various places. It had the \\"young toughs\\" fighting and the turf wars, the big bosses controlling the pay for play money and, of course the dramatic lapses of gravity in some of the combat scenes that leave jumping fighters floating a few seconds longer in the air than is actually possible. Delightful in every way for those of us who still enjoy the older movies. But what it didn't have was the authenticity of the first IP Man movie. The rich quality of filming, choreography and acting that set this first film apart from anything of this genre I have ever watched was missing. It also delved heavily into the personal life of Yip Man where scenes of his interaction with family almost compromised the reputation he burned into my mind from the first film. The producers made him personable, approachable and sensitive - less magnanimous. To be honest, it disappointed me. He cried when he discovered his relative, having been shot in the head by the Japanese, had become brain damaged from the wound and did not recognize him.  To be accurate, he was always attentive to his family in IP Man 1 but not warm and mushy. This isn't a bad thing. I just didn't expect it. Still, I watched every moment of IP Man 2 and will watch it again concentrating particularly on the solo hand to hand fighting that has made Donny Yen bigger than life.

It should be required viewing for not only anyone who is interested in politics or economy, it should be required for anyone who hopes to survive in the modern world. That being said, watching it will make you want to punch a hole in your TV.  It doesn't necessarily add anything new, but it collects all the heretofore confusing information and contextualizes it to make sense of the chaos that we're still going through.    The fact that there's not people in the streets rioting all over the West like there has been in North Africa is pretty shocking after watching this.

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|3.8 stars<br /><br />The first half hour here had me squirming in mild pain at the general predictability of it all, but then suddenly once we enter TronLand everything ratchets up. The movie becomes not only amazingly gorgeous but actually quite interesting, mainly due to Jeff Bridges' surprisingly affecting performance. The script could have gone much deeper on the issues of cyber/human interface and where that's taking us, but I guess the Mouse doesn't really ever want to get that deep. A missed opportunity, but then you've got to sell your toys first and foremost!<br /><br />Bridges shows real growth as an actor as compared to the original film; I recall seeing that the weekend it opened with all the other kids eager for New Electronic Graphics! And it delivered, as does its sequel. The light cycle sequences are especially fine and neo-noir glistening, and they make this movie work, along with Bridges. He's easily the highlight, but all the actors are at least decent, and there's less b-movie feel here than I expected.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is also stunningly crisp, one of the best I've yet seen, of hundreds. These effects deserved perfect reproduction, and they got it. I can imagine that this flick would be mighty fun in 3D, and look forward to seeing that one day. But until then, props to Disney for an entertaining film that, while no great work of cinematic art, is certainly a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />If you're looking for dramatic perfection, it ain't here. But if you want to settle back and let your eyeballs revel for a while, Tron Legacy will do the job nicely.

B004K4IZ54|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of the Tron films and the Blu-ray release of Tron: Legacy didn't disappoint.  From the 3D cover to the discs inside the entire collection is fun.  Each disc is printed to look like one of the characters discs.  My only disappointment was that there wasn't a booklet inside, instead there are just ads for other Disney offers.<br /><br />The discs offer a lot of fun extras but my favorite is \\"Kevin Flynn: The Next Day\\", which shows you press conferences, interviews, news pieces and shots of Sam crashing Encom's parties.  I enjoyed the piece a lot and thought it added something to the film itself.  I recommend this version for anyone who enjoyed the films and is looking to own them.
0143034901|4.0|A good read. Inventive story line and good pace. If you like a good spook story(ies), this book is for you. Could not put it down. I was reading it so fast, at times I had to re-read a passage just so I can keep up with the plot. As a spanish speaking person I can say the translation was nearly flawless. I liked the hardcopy version of this book since it has maps showing the location of the many places where the action of this book happens. (I don't know if the Kindle version has the maps also). You'll even want to get a passport and visit Spain!
B001QWEE4E|5.0|This boundary breaking film is the best film I have ever seen.  Easy to dismiss  as a \\"gay\\" film, it is so much more. It is a fully drawn character portrait of 2 characters who meet, but are not in the same spot at the time.  this film chronicles their struggle from where they are to reach that point together.  Director Ang Lee has ever been better.  Heath Ledger unbelievably missed the Oscar but his portrayal will stay with you for a long time.  This is a multi Award winning is a most memorable film!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really did enjoy this book - and I have recommended it to several others who have had the same reaction I did! Of course bits and pieces were similar to Twilight, but what book is TRULY an original anymore? ALL books seem to have bits and pieces of other books in them. I stayed up til the wee hours finishing it - knowing that as soon as it ended I would be disappointed that I didn't wait to finish it!  BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!    If you enjoy witches, vampires and romance - with a little danger thrown in - you will enjoy this book.

B004NSULHM|5.0|Radiohead is my favorite band. Ever. Kid A is my favorite album. Ever. So imagine my surprise that upon first listening to the King of Limbs, my reaction was one of confusion. I was left saying \\"Huh\\" instead of \\"WOW\\" like I did with In Rainbows. On initial listens, most of the songs sounded the same and the songs themselves just seemed to stay in one place. I thought I was all for Radiohead continuing to change directions and keep mixing things up, but at first I was disappointed with this one.<br /><br />Today, I can tell you that I am not disappointed with this album and instead, I'm rather fond of it. Perhaps the best thing about Radiohead is how much stuff they have going on in their music. Ever since OK Computer, the band has put in more and more sonic layers, effects and whatever else they could find into their songs. Not to say that they do so randomly or without thought; quite the contrary. All of these things serve the songs and make them better.<br /><br />I think this is why The King of Limbs was so hard to get into. It is by far the most dense album Radiohead has created. There may only be 8 songs on here, but there's a lot in those songs. At first it can be hard to latch onto something just because it's overwhelming. When I broke all of the elements down and focused, the album made sense.<br /><br />Even if you don't like The King of Limbs as much as I do, it's more than worth the $6 price tag to check in with the best band working today. Just make sure you give it your time and attention.<br /><br />EDIT 8/14/12: Bumped to five stars because this is the album I've listened to the most in the last year and a half and I love it more every time I give it a spin.
0316056863|5.0|I couldn't read this book slow enough!  Usually I race through books, but I really wanted to savor this one.  It was highly enjoyable and I can't recommend it enough.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The Lives of Others, also known as \\"Das Leben der Anderen\\" is a well done drama set in East Germany in the mid 1980's about wiretapping by the Stasi. It is a story of love, betrayal, and crime. It has won multiple awards and deserved the awards it won.    What was so surprising when I saw this movie was that this was the first feature film Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (as he had been previously known in Germany for a short film he made before) has directed. He reminded me of a seasoned professional in his pacing and the way the scenes melded together. Sadly, the Tourist, the other major movie so far he has directed does not meet these expectations but this is saved for another time.    The acting is stellar as nothing is lost through looking at subtitles.  Ulrich Mühe is wonderful as the lead actor and it is sad to say that he died only a few months after the Oscar's. Sebastian Koch plays a great supporting role as the playwright he spies on while Martina Gedeck is wonderfully morose as Koch's girlfriend. The pace is perfect as the director knows how to make each scene fit as regardless of it being 2 hour movie. It is one of those films that feels shorter than it is.     This is a sad film and I do not wish to spoil the plot as it is a movie that just needs to be seen. For its pacing alone, this is a wonderful film and a wonderful directorial debut.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I see some of the mixed reviews, but I'm surprised.  I just finished TWMF and thoroughly enjoyed it, better than any book I've read in years.  I reread The Name of the Wind right before reading book 2.  The story flowed seemlessly from one to another.  There's a cast of new characters and plots, but the original story grows and the original characters become more developed making you appreciate each of them more.  The plot itself seems to be growing to a big finish, but the story getting to that finish is better than any I've ever read. The only bad thing about this book is that I cannot instantly start reading book #3.  However, the good thing about this is that I know I'll get to read books #1 and #2 again and have no qualms about doing so.
0439023513|5.0|I was unsure of what was to become of this story, but I wasn't disappointed. This trilogy really digs into the disparity between people in control and people who labor under that control. We all want to believe we are free however how many people are truly so? Katniss was used as a pawn in a game played to keep a country under control, in this final book of the series we see that the Capitol squanders the peoples goods and work and watches while they struggle even as they reap the benefits of that struggle. We hope for the help from the only District that isn't living by the system. Then we find out that in the communal living of this district there are dangers as well. I feel that this book really shows how differing political systems challenge us and our beliefs of what is right and wrong, and what defines \\"liberty\\". The people in either system are being used, which one offers more true choice, true freedom? In the end we find that as different as both people in control were, they were also very much alike. Power over people corrupts those that are unwilling to seek a middle ground or unwilling to look for consensus. The trilogy was fabulous and this final chapter I believe was a wonderful way of ending it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Love this period drama, so much that I now have three versions - Original DVD, remake of the DVD, then 1st Blu-Ray re-mastered version.  I am trying hard not to purchase this 16x9 4th version.  I use the first two copies to loan to friends, who all love it.  I've viewed this so many times, I even dragged my husband into parts of it.  If you have not purchased, definitely a 'must' for any movie collector.
0517548232|5.0|In these times of massive government budget deficits ($1.6 TRILLION deficit on $3.8 TRILLION spending for fiscal 2011 alone), when even a few billion dollars of cuts in spending are called \\"extreme\\" or \\"draconian\\" by those policy makers in Washington whose power base is firmly entrenched in the special interest groups committed to keep those government spending dollars flowing, this book is more of a must read than ever before.  A deep understanding of economics can be had by reading this book and it will not require an understanding of calculus, or an analysis of complicated mathematical proofs.  As the author says, \\"When we study the effects of various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short run, but on all groups in the long run, the conclusions we arrive at usually correspond with those of unsophisticated common sense.\\"    Economics in One Lesson was written after the \\"new\\" theories of economics espoused after the Great Depression, largely by John Maynard Keynes in his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money in 1936.  Keynes theorized that the cause of the Great Depression was a lack of adequate consumer spending, and that the corrective government policy is for the government to simply make up for that lack in consumer spending by increasing government spending.  Economics in One Lesson clearly points out the fallacies of such thinking.    A summary of the \\"one lesson\\" is encapsulated in this quote from the book:  \\"Many things that seem to be true when we concentrate on a single economic group are seen to be illusions when the interests of everyone ... are considered.  To see the problem as a whole, and not in fragments:  that is the goal of economic science.\\"    The author describes the two central errors that occur and damage our overall economy because policy makers tend to:   1) focus only on particular interest groups to the neglect of others, and   2) consider only the immediate consequences of an act or proposal.    Next the author applies the lesson to several policies (government spending as stimulus for the economy, minimum wage laws, overgenerous and extended unemployment relief payments, redistributive government policy, consequences of government deficits and debt, inflation, government loans or guarantees of loans) and shows the long-term, overall disastrous effects of these policies.    Consider the policy idea of government guarantee of mortgages.  In 1946 the author, prophetically, wrote this:  \\"Government-guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down payment or no down payments whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than otherwise.  They force the general taxpayer to subsidize the bad risks and to defray the losses.  They encourage people to \\"buy\\" houses that they cannot really afford.  They tend eventually to bring about an oversupply of houses as compared with other things.  They temporarily over-stimulate building, raise the cost of building for everybody (including the buyers of the homes with the guaranteed mortgages), and may mislead the building industry into an eventually costly overexpansion.  In brief, in the long run they do not increase overall national production but encourage mal-investment.\\"    Did the government policy makers who declared that home-ownership is a \\"right\\", and forced banks to grant mortgages to every living person regardless of their credit worthiness and with virtually no down-payments, foresee the resultant housing market bubble that grew from the 1970's through 2008 when the bubble finally burst?  Did they consider the long-term results of their policies, or did they just see the Pollyanna good they thought they were doing for the people \\"buying\\" homes they couldn't afford and would eventually not pay for.  We now have a higher than ever before glut of housing on the market (many such homes stand vacant), more foreclosures in process and yet to begin the process, housing starts for new construction will likelynot recover for years, many more mortgages are \\"underwater\\", and a huge fall in the home values of virtually every American.  What a prime example of do-gooder government policy in its full glory of unintended consequences.    Read this book.  We all need to have an understanding of economic principles as our Country faces massive deficits and debt from 80 years of unpaid for government promises that we clearly cannot afford.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|We've own a couple music players that we could no longer use once we upgraded to iPhone4 (it is fatter than the 3) unless we took the covers off of the phone.  One cover is an Otter Box, one a thin skin.  With this extention, no need to remove either type cover.  It works perfectly on all the players.
0439023521|4.0|It's entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once. The author creates a ridculously additicting story in a dark apocolypic world where (likeable) teenagers are pitted against each other in a fight to the death. Only my sick mind would suggest that the book isn't really brutal or gory, considering the actual basis of The Hunger Games, but there were parts that gave you just enough information to let you know the extent of it. I am surprised how much I enjoyed this one, not one I would have picked up with out the persistance of others.
B000AL730O|5.0|If you're putting together a CD-R collection or iPod playlist of a post-1960s Beatles, you should simply buy this CD outright. This was Paul's greatest resurgence as a bona fide Beatle since `Flaming Pie'. This time, though, he would come through with a corker of a follow-up CD--'Memory Almost Full--that would have just as many Beatlesworthy tracks as `Chaos'.

B003Y8YXGC|3.0|There is some excellent material on this album, but it's certainly not a Lennon album to listen through from start to finish. I do prefer the remastered `Meat City' to the original that was so harsh and brittle. `You Are Here' is very lush and very nice. `Aisumaisen', if you fade in about halfway into the track, is a gem with a spectacular guitar-solo finish. `Out the Blue', if you take the beginning and ending and edit out the tedious middle, becomes a gorgeous song-let. `Only People', if you get rid of the inane verses (that's every verse), becomes a charming chorus-only song-let. Unless you're thrilled to have a Lennon-penned anthem to muddled New Age thinking, `Mind Games' belongs to the second-tier, along with `Tight-As' and `Intuition'. `I Know (I Know)' is destroyed by its repeated quasi-middle-8, which gives me nausea. `One Day at a Time'...aw Jeez John, have mercy. Ditto `Bring on the Lucie', featuring the worst protest-song lyrics I have ever heard. Just dreadful. Indeed, if you listen to the bad on here along with the good, it will undermine the good as well.

0307454541|2.0|If you take into account the whole book, it's just okay. The book doesn't even get really interesting til you are halfway through it. There is a lot of fluff that could have been left out that does not contribute to the story one iota. Also, I was surprised at the sexual violence. If you don't mind sexual violence scenes being recounted in detail then you might not mind reading this book. I minded and read the whole thing just to say that I did.

B004W5T2RG|4.0|Country Strong is surprising.  I expected a certain amount of cheese because the country music industry can be seriously cheesy, but Country Strong did not deliver.  I was pleasantly surprised by this gritty portrayal of fame and addiction.    Gweneth Paltrow was believable as the broken Kelly Canter, and Garret Hedlund gives a stunning performance as Beau Hutton.  He seemed as if they really had plucked him out of a honkytonk in Nashville.    The writer's could have done a better job developing the story more fully.  I wanted more background into Kelly's fall from grace, and I wanted the character of Chiles Stanton to be fleshed out a bit more.  Overall, though, Country Strong is worth watching.  It celebrates the sorrow that country music used to be about.
0761129235|5.0|I took this book to heart and I have made several positive changes in my life.  The simple principle (do 1 small step to start) creates a can-do attitude for anything you want to accomplish.  It's amazing that an American came up with this and the Japanese have embraced it whole heartedly whereas the American businesses have pretty much dropped it.

B0007TKNII|3.0|I got this for my daughter, who as a singer loves musicals. We prepared by watching the early Lon Chaney version.  The story retains much of its magic in the ALW version:  the lonely misfit of talent, pursuing his art and mixing it with love, and becoming an insane murderer to realize his visions.  Then there is the brilliant ingenue and her chance at love as well as an entrance to the proper society, whose tragic origins lend her a natural sympathy for the misfit, who is helping her career.  SHe must choose, in a way, between artistic excellence with much insanity and life.<br /><br />My daughter had very interesting criticisms.  First, the story is rather rarified.  This ALW couldn't change, so he did a good job at romanticizing it in spite of this limitation.  Second, while the music is very nice, it is rather repetitive, essentially the same melody through just about every song.  When I listened carefully, I realized this is true.  Third, two of the singers - the Phantom and the Aristocrat love interest - are both mediocre singers and not very good actors.  Even I, with my less trained ear, would cringe every time the Phantom sang.  It is the biggest failing of the production.<br /><br />That being said, there are many things that work in the production.  The ingenue is really excellent and has a wonderful singing voice.  She is a first rate talent, it would appear.  The set is also very well done, with the Paris Opera in the belle epoque.  Though repetitive, the music is beautiful and has stuck in my head.  Finally, there are many good characters, from the nervous producers to the complicit ballet teacher, making the story entertaining.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats.
B004SBX112|1.0|it turns out the paid version is not supported. the free version on the android market was updated but its clear by now the paid version will not be. I guess once they have your money the hell with you.   I'll never buy/download another app from Rovio.

Sarah's story is great, but the modern day story is so so...in my opinion this made the story kind of hokey and I would have appreciated more development of the historical aspects of the story instead of flashing forward to modern day...
B002ZG980U|5.0|Unknown to the majority of the populous until late 2009/early 2010, Christopher Nolan was not attempting a directorial debut with Batman Begins, The Prestige, or The Dark Knight. No. He directed said films to gain experience for an idea which had been simmering in his mind for almost a decade:Inception, which was to be his breakthrough as a major feature film director. Though not as highly successful overall as The Dark Knight, which mainly received such favorable reviews because of Heath Ledger's posthumous Academy Award, Inception was a success in its own way: subtly brilliant, with a plot simple enough to comprehend but twisting enough to keep your attention.   The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is fantastic. Though perhaps not his best composition work, it definitely earns him a place among his greats. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor as always. Ken Watanabe fully captures the corporate businessman's enigmatic role. Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and Michael Caine are each persuasive in their own way, making the characters believable as well as drawing the appropriate emotion out of you.The plot is an obvious Nolan brainchild. Who else would compile such a brilliant and stunning script and successfully tie it together for one brilliant finale? Not many.  Watch this movie. Find the time: it will be worth your while. Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest director's of our time, and he will be until his career has come to a close.   Rated PG-13   For Intense Sequences of Violence and Action throughout

B004WMKSH2|3.0|No technical problems for me but I didn't try to stream.  I downloaded to my Tivo.  Worked perfectly.    The film itself frankly felt way too dark to be a Harry Potter film.  It's taking itself way too seriously.  Also I hated the colored lens work. in this one.  If you are really, really into everyone being green, this is the film for you.  It was also way too long, though this is really the fault of J. K. Rowling.  You can tell when an authors gotten too big for their own good, they clearly stop listening to their editors.  Rowling is a classic example of this problem.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary will tell you what you do doubt already know: that the country's economy is run by millionaire insiders who cycle in and out of government, regulatory and Wall Street jobs, perpetuating an economic model based on moving money around, not on creating new wealth, new jobs and a better America.      What you may not know, and what the movie will demonstrate with shattering effect, is how incompetent, how venal and how mendacious these masters of the universe are in real life.  The smartest ones - Larry Summers, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and the rest - had the brains to stay away from the camera, lying by their silence - but enough others were apparently so sure no one was watching that they agreed to be interviewed, and so can be seen by all as they stammer, lie, prevaricate and even make  pathetic little attempts at pugnacity while the interviewer strips them naked, lie by lie.  My favorite moment: the business school genius who took $120,000 to write a report,  Stability of Markets in Iceland, a few weeks before Icelandic banks imploded and the economy crashed.  In his online resume', the title the report then became, Instability of Markets in Iceland.   Just a typo, the man explained.         There are dozens of similar moments. Don't miss it.
0312962118|5.0|My 2nd favorite book. I enjoy the technique of starting in the present, going back telling the story, then concluding in present day again. The characters elicited sympathy across the board. The relationship between the 2 male protagonists was riveting. The mission was historic. I found myself drawn to tears at the end. Great story.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Of all the sets of Beethoven's piano sonatas I've heard -- old and modern, mono and stereo, analog and digital -- this is the one I will always return to.    Everything is balanced. The tempos, articulation, rubato, recording perspective ... just right. There is nothing showy or mannered, just the sound of a master engaging fully with the Everest of piano repertory.    The only issue is 1960s tape hiss, which is faint but noticeable in the quiet passages. Luckily, the mastering engineers did not attempt to filter it out, so the ambience of the recording studio is fully preserved. Over time, I've come not to mind it at all. It adds a texture of warm authenticity.    Recommended without reservation.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It's ironic, I suppose, that a movie titled \\"The King's Speech\\" leaves me speechless. How do I describe this film? Yes, I knew it would be a British film, a period piece, a study of a stutterer. Those things did not keep me away, but neither did they draw me into the theater at full price. The movie is so much more than that, though, full of humor, tension, and pathos, and shame on me for expecting any less with a cast of this caliber.<br /><br />Colin Firth plays a middle-aged royal, growing up in the first half of the twentieth century, through the First World War and the threat of a second. We see him early on, attempting to deliver a speech in his public role as a son of the British monarchy, and we ache with his struggle. Soon, though, his role becomes more than that, when his ailing father passes away and his older brother is put on the pedestal as the reigning king. Only one problem: the older brother is more interested in pursuing his private pleasures and personal love than in taking on that lordly mantel, and this waywardness puts the British Empire in danger as Hitler lurks on the European horizon. Who can rise up with integrity and courage to speak boldly for British subjects around the world? Can Colin Firth's historical figure fill those shoes when he can't even utter a sentence without stuttering?<br /><br />It's this true-to-life and larger-than-life tableau that make the story much more engaging and important than I realized from the trailers and ads. Not only is one man, one royal, facing his own fears and insecurities birthed from the past, but he is also doing so as a figurehead for millions of others in one of the most important hours of the last hundred years.<br /><br />Firth is incredible in his role, giving us so much emotion through tiny tics and twitches, through each word and lack thereof. Just as powerful, Geoffrey Rush is the Australian therapist who casts aside all pretensions and treats his royal patient as an equal. The interactions between them are priceless. Helena Bonham Carter plays Firth's wife, a subdued role for her, and one in which she shows her range. Add to this Guy Pearce and Timothy Spall, among others, and it's hard to imagine any better cast. The story is engaging, funny, and ultimately moving. And there's some strangely vicarious enjoyment in seeing Queen Elizabeth portrayed as a young girl, as well as Winston Churchill in his hours before becoming prime minister.<br /><br />In a year of some very strong films for the Best Picture Oscar, I find no reason to complain about this one pulling out the victory. Like it's main character, it rises above its outward challenges and speaks for all those who have faced obstacles physical, mental, and emotional. What a great movie. I don't know how else to say it.ss. Helena Bonham Carter plays Firth's wife, a subdued role for her, and one in which she shows her range.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I liked it much better than the first installation, but that may be because part two has more of an adventure element, whereas part one was largely focused on a single theme (\\"wow, that kid's life is hard\\"). While the two existent Kingkiller Chronicles fall victim to some classic fantasy novel clichés (why must half of everything have a fanciful new name? why much fanciful names have impossible to pronounce consonant clusters and vowel clusters whose pronunciation is impossible to even guess? why is no one ever named \\"steve\\" or \\"joan\\"?), it avoids the more egregious fantasy novel sins. Rothfuss is both able to describe action with a level of detail that makes it real without weighing the reader down, and smart enough to know that the reader isn't really interested in the details of every journey, fight or sexual encounter. If you like adventure stories, this is a great example of the genre. If you like fantasy novels, it's got plenty of magic and cloaks. But best of all, at its heart, Wise Man's Fear doesn't take itself too seriously. It is funny, touching and occasionally silly by turns.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|A Feast for Crows was disappointing.  Reading through Cersei's chapters was a boring, sometimes disgusting, slog -- and her chapters do dominate the book, as others have pointed out.    I came to this book with no interest in what Cersei was thinking, and Feast did nothing to alter my opinion.    As a whole, Feast seemed like a placeholder.  Pages and pages of set-up, with no progression or resolution in this installment.      Arya, Jaime, and Sam make appearances.  Cersei, however, is the only character who has any agency in book four.    The first three were so fantastic that no review stopped me from reading the fourth.  I guess I have now joined the club.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|this is a fantastic knife sharpener, i got one 2 years ago and it has been great since, it does a great job with sharpening nearly any blade... while the serade sharpener is a bit iffy, it tends to mis-shape them if not done perfectly, it does sharpen anything from a kitchen knife to a swiss army knife to a KABAR. i highly recommend
B0034G4OY0|1.0|First off, you have that totally useless subplot with Cecile De France (that CAN'T be her real name...?). You could cut the entire subplot out and not lose a thing. Her character is totally lame and unlikable (and so is that douche she's dating in the film) and worst of all, the subplot is boring as hell. She just spends time thinking about her magical escape from death in the opening tsunami scene, which should have been looped continuously for two hours, as it would have been better than the B/S we got.<br /><br />Then you have Matt Damon's subplot, which plays like a really bad episode of Ghost Whisperer. Seriously he should have won a razzie, his performance here is so bad it's beyond surrealism. He is basically this psychic who can talk to dead people, and he meets this messed up hot chick in an Italian Cooking school, a subplot within a subplot that is soon left to die. I really can't remember what happened in this subplot, it was so damned uninteresting.<br /><br />The ONLY interesting story was the British kid. I'll admit this movie was a bit of a nostalgic rush for me (which may be why it gets one star as opposed to 0) because a week before I watched this movie, I was in London and Paris for vacation. But this was an interesting substory, as he loses his twin brother, lives with a drug-addled mother, and has trouble adjusting to life with a new family. I'll admit there were a few humorous scenes and his search to talk to his brother was interesting and had me wanting to know more. Actually the movie could have been this and it would have worked a solid 3/5 off the bat.<br /><br />And then the ending where it all comes together is just LAME!!!! If I am going to sit through a movie with 3 subplots with only one being even remotely interesting, I want a satisfactory conclusion. And don't get me started on the Romatic Comedy puke-fest of an ending. It brought back painful memories of \\"The Tourist\\".<br /><br />I really love Clint, but this film was just an embarassment on every level. This came from the same Clint Eastwood who gave us the amazing \\"Gran Torino\\", bear in mind. I don't even think replacing Matt Damon with Jennifer Love Hewitt would have saved the film.e from the same Clint Eastwood who gave us the amazing \\"Gran Torino\\", bear in mind.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|\\"Inside Job\\" is an excellent but extremely disturbing film about the root causes of the financial crisis in America. It clearly explains how Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers et al. bet the farm on a series of shaky but extremely lucrative financial instruments that left America bankrupt while they made millions and walked away scot free!!! Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know the truth. 5 thumbs up!!!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album is awesome.  If you like any previous Foo Fighters songs you will love this CD.  It really rocks.  My favorite cuts are Rope, Burning Bridges, Arlandria and Dear Rosemary.  (Bob Mould's voice sounds great on backup on Dear Rosemary.) Sounds great especially turned up really loud in your car.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
0316069353|3.0|Mickey Haller has never been my favorite Michael Connelly character.  However, in The Reversal, Haller worked for the prosecution and I thought I might change my mind about him.  Now, in The Fifth Witness, Haller is back to being a defense attorney...and I'm back to not liking this character...he is shrewd and indifferent about truth and justice...his only focus is winning.  The Fifth Witness is a courtroom thriller...not much action outside court...lots of courtroom strategy and trickery...reminded me a lot of early John Grisham books.  I'm hoping Connelly's next book is a Harry Bosch book.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|You will probably like this book. I guess I'm a fan of Tina Fey? This book is similar to 30 rock / SNL, in that it sometimes delves into political/controversial issues, but in a joking, self-deprecating way. Overall, this is a great light read and I look forward to more from her in the future.
0709058764|5.0|High quality book that as far as I can tell left nothing out. There are some complaints about a lack of prints by some of the reviewers, but violins vary and there is no one print that can cover the variations.     I don't know how accurate the drawings are as compared to an actual Strad are , but if you can find a complete copy of  You Can Make a Stradivarius Violin by Reid, Joseph 1967  there are some fairly decent full size drawings (24\\" X 36\\" I think) in the book for the violin, the mould and all the required tools.
B004L49K20|5.0|The past few new CD's have been good with a few hidden gems.  But this one hits it out of the ballpark.  I liked the slower songs the best on this CD.<br /><br />Favorites-The Man Who Stole A Leopard(what a strange and wonderful song-so different and unique-it is great!)<br /><br />My favorite is the song Mediterranea- it has brought me to tears several times-their best in years.<br /><br />The lead song/title of CD is a great start with good hooks you will be humming it by the third time you listen to it.<br /><br />I knew this CD was great. Almost everyday I have woke up and have been humming one of the songs.<br /><br />I noticed they will not be hitting Detroit, MI for their tour this time-very upsetting-I hope they at least release it on DVD. They came to Detroit for the Red Carpet Massacre and Astronaut tours(I went to see both of them).<br /><br />Get this now!
B000MV9026|3.0|Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition) is an OK animated movied. The story line is about mumble a penguin that dances but can not sing. In penguin society everything is based on how you sing. Because of this he is seen as different and an outcast. The message to accept others is a good one. However, then the move starts with an overtly political message about evil humans and good animals. A children's movie should not deal with politics. The voice acting is great and Elijah Wood is great as Mumble. Still an OK movie. 3/5.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|Little wonder this poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted production won a Sundance Festival award.  After all, it's a Hollywood elitist's perfect vision of Southern hillbillies as inbreeding, meth-cooking, camo-wearing white trash.  There's a satellite dish in every junked-up, clothesline-strung yard, hinting that the menfolk gotta have their pro-wrestling matches and porn flicks, but won't buy their women dryers, if not washers.  There's not a blade of grass in sight, so no wonder the family's horse is going hungry since the hay ran out.  Everything is so bleak there's not even a Confederate flag to brighten the gloom.  It's hard to believe this is the United States, since there's seemingly no government welfare, homestead-protection laws, or rules regarding conduct of the courts or police.  The whole premise of the story is that the protagonist's pa has put up the family's home as a surety bond--without his spouse's co-signature--and thus has subjected the wife and kids to eviction within a week of an assumed bail skip.  Whatever hinterland twilight zone this is, even the family's timber-rich land isn't enough to cover bail for a meth crime, since some nameless person had to lay down a crumpled wad of cash to spring pa.  And, apparently, so many folks have cut off one of their hands to fool the law into thinking they're dead that only two cropped paws will convice the cops!   The characters are depicted as backwoods primitives, and yet a twelve-year-old boy doesn't know how to aim and fire a gun, cut up deer meat, or skin and butcher a squirrel.  The seventeen-year-old heroine doesn't know how to properly hang garments on a line or fry potatoes in a skillet (but odds are neither does the director!).  The former even believes that, if she joins the Army, her underage sibs can come along.  Moreover, there's no indication that her actions are driven by pride or independence, no hint that she'd rather eat squirrel than deign to seek food stamps.  She's evidently just a desperate and dumb high-school dropout who's not on dope \\"yet\\" (to quote her).    Most of the characters are mean, ill-bred, and inconstant.  Some have Southern accents, and some don't.  A few of the extras look noirishly odd, but this absurdist tale is not noir--as at least one critic has claimed.  Noir involves gritty realism and everypersons caught up in turns of fate.  This movie involves credibility-straining stereotypes in a left-wing fantasy.
0316056863|5.0|Great read.  Bravo.  But after reading some of the ignorant \\"one star\\" reviews on this sight- I think Tina is going to have to write an addition to the \\"Dear Internet\\" chapter in her book.

B0028NSE5K|4.0|Albert King/Stevie Ray Vaughan: In Session(2010). American blues stars Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan create blues jam-session magic during this historic 1983 recording. The show, which was taped live in a club in Austin, Texas on December 5, 1983, was recorded for the Canadian live music TV series \\"In Session.\\" As both popular singer-songwriters are now, unfortunately, gone from the scene, relatively young, and this was the only time they were recorded playing together, this classic rock disk is likely to be a must for blues fans. The musicians play off each other beautifully: it's hard to credit that they hadn't rehearsed together for months, but, in fact, sources say that King, already an established star, was unwilling to play with Vaughan, until the older musician realized that he had already played with the native Texan before, under the moniker of \\"little Stevie.\\"<br /><br />The set, unfortunately, lacks three hit songs that are on the DVD of the same concert.  Albert King's signature song, \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" penned in 1967 by Booker T. Jones, of Stax Records' Booker T. and the MG's, and William Bell. Also lacking are \\"Texas Flood,\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town,\\" a hit for Louis Jordan, and also Ray Charles.  The DVD does give us T-Bone Walker's classic \\"Call It Stormy Monday,\\" \\"Matchbox Blues,\\"  Tampa Red's \\"Don't Lie to Me,\\" \\"Overall Junction,\\" and \\"Pride and Joy.\\"<br /><br />King was born in Indianola, Mississippi, on April 25, 1923, as, coincidentally, was B.B. King - no relation, nor is the third blues King, Freddie King. However, Albert did, perhaps, like to fudge things a little: he called his favorite Gibson Flying V guitar Lucy, as B.B. King calls his guitar Lucille. I actually did get to listen to Albert live, quite a few times; his power could energize a room.  In fact, I followed Albert around for two weeks observing him on his first, possibly his only, tour of the United Kingdom, in, I believe, 1969.  I almost didn't get to go.  I was, initially, to be traveling on a ticket meant for a Memphis Horn.  But when the impresario of the tour discovered the Horns weren't coming, he was furious, and cashed in those tickets.  However, I'd already pre-sold my article on Albert to \\"Cavalier,\\" a magazine current at the time.  So Stax, his recording company,  bought me a ticket.<br /><br />At any rate, B.B. is still with us, but Albert passed of a heart attack on December 21, 1992. His career was made when he was signed by the Memphis-based Stax, in 1967: his first album for them was, in fact, \\"Born Under a Bad Sign.\\" The Texas born Vaughan, who was born on October 3, 1954, was killed in a foggy-day helicopter crash on August 27, 1990.<br /><br />Unless you particularly want this as a CD, I can't see why you wouldn't get the DVD with those important three more songs.s, initially, to be traveling on a ticket meant for a Memphis Horn.

B004FOA84A|3.0|Way too short. Storyline non-existent. Graphics are good. Puzzles aren't too bad. It's an okay game. Not the kind of game that you can play more than once.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|We over-analyze everything as far as entertainment, whether we're tricked or not, were we entertained thats why we watch movies in the first place, to get an emotion, feeling from it. And this movie is haunting, it stuck with me all night. And I'm hard on movies not in the critic sense, but it takes alot to entertain me. This was fresh. One thing I will say that I found was there is an anxious edgy feel every second your watching, you keep on the edge just waiting for the next weird thing to happen. I enjoyed this, since alot of movies have bored me to death, the new Clash of the titans, Scream 4, etc they all are *yawn lose their audience. With this the metamorphosis was captivating and well done. But why take anyone's word for it, watch it for yourself. It is a psychological thriller one of the better ones I've seen. Watching her unravel, and what youthink is happening isn't and what you think isn't is. Loved this one. Will own.
B000784WMW|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this version mini-series of Jane Eyre. The scenery was great, the acting superb, the characters well portrayed. I would recommend it to anyone seeking an alternate version of this story.
B004856SQ8|4.0|Not bad I liked it I haven't really watch the old A team so I don't know how true to the characters this movie is to them. Started with action and it ended with action. It's your typical storyline plot but I have no complaints I enjoyed it and love watching it. And hope there is a second movie in the works.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app! I can read all of my books on the go. Contrary to the negative reviews this app allows highlighting and note taking. Also if you highlight a word, it will let you decide if you want to go to wikipedia or dictionary(.)com. It syncs every time I open the app and all of my books appear as long as I make sure to send them to my phone. Yes you do have to have payment info but even though the app is free not every book is. It really is a great app, just don't let the negative reviews dissuade you from trying it out.
B004H0N4PC|3.0|I have listened to the album several times now and I am currently of the opinion that \\"Build A Rocket Boys\\" falls far short of the fantastic \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\". This is a very average album.  Especially for Elbow. A little too mellow.  I wish they would have cut it loose a few more times.  The opening track \\"The Birds\\" is by far the best track on the album, followed by \\"Lippy Kids\\", \\"High Ideals\\" and \\"Dear Friends\\".  Perhaps a little too \\"safe\\" would be how I describe the album.  Elbow seem to have lost a lot of the edge that was present with previous albums.  Of course I will keep listening and it may grow on me more.  But right now I have serious doubts that it will.  Overall it is just too...bland.    Having said all that, \\"The Birds\\"....man what a great song.  It really soars at around the 5 minute mark and has me reaching for the volume to crank it up everytime I listen to it.  But I am afraid to say that I don't find myself reaching for the volume during the rest of the album.  It definitely needed some more \\"crank it up\\" moments.  No other tracks really even come close to the great opening track.  And that is a disappointment. Elbow is one of the better and more creative bands going these days.  And the day in which a new Elbow album is released will always be a good day.  Only this time it is just not as good as I was hoping.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Don't look at the reviews just read it ! Honestly this is the best book I have ever read .
B001PB3RU8|4.0|I usually stick to book reviews, but Lungs is such a strong album that it deserves all the praise it can get. As debuts go, I'd rate it up there with those of Tori Amos and Tracy Chapman. (Though in fairness to Amos, the starkly personal nature of her lyrics in Little Earthquakes would give it a slight edge over Lungs.) The lyrics are poetic, and the music is energetic and gripping--a blend of Amos, Sarah MacLachlan, and Kate Bush, all seemingly fired up on a six-pack of Red Bull.<br /><br />There isn't a weak track on this album, though the blazing gems of \\"Dog Days Are Over\\"; \\"Rabbit Heart\\"; \\"Drumming Song\\"; and \\"Cosmic Love\\" stand out. The only thing missing would be a ballad suitable for slow dancing in the dark, though arguably that would be inconsistent with the album's energy level.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great one for almost anything--a gray day in the office or an open sunswept highway. I'm hooked. 4-1/2 pulsing white-hot stars.
0786956291|5.0|I am a 2nd generation DnD player thanks to my parents who played the original 1st and AD&D, so I've been playing DnD for a long time now. By far ADnD is my favorite (partially because that is how I first learned to play) but usually am not a fan of the newer versions (such as 3 and 3.5) so needless to say I was very skeptical on playing DnD 4th Edition and so I waited for a Starter Set to come out and give it a shot, you know something cheap to try out and get the feeling of the game and see how I liked it. I didn't like the Player's Handbook and the rest of the 4th Edition stuff but this Starter Set along with the Essentials I find to be most entertaining and a great starter for anyone who is interested in playing 4th Edition DnD.     Although there were a few downsides, mainly the cards are really flimsy and I'm afraid I will rip them, there is a lot of potential and a lot going on in the Starter Set. The biggest advantage is for both new players and also new DMs for future games. It gives you a general idea of how to play a character but also gives fantastic encouraging tips and advice for new DMs who really just want to start their own story and move it along.     I really enjoyed this set because everything was included, it was cheap and it is valuable. Although I've seen people complain that they will need to eventually switch things over to the Essentials (such as Wizard becomes Mage and Cleric becomes Warpriest) I reallly like that idea, and any good DM will be able to play that to their own advantages and right now because of the Starter Set I have been able to come up with a valuable Compaign that I look forward to playing with my friends as well as expanding it with various kinds of twist and turns.     What also makes this very valuable is the creativity on how to teach people how to play DnD 4th Edition that went into the Essentials and in the Starter Set. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the game-- which is always the most important.
1400079144|5.0|Dan Brown never fails to write a great book.  Some aspects I don't like, e.g how he goes back and forth between the main character's point of view.  One minute you are hearing things from the la male and becoming totally involved in his story just to be left hanging while the next chapters turns to the thoughts and actions of the enemy.  It goes back and forth never failing to hold you in suspension.  I had to keep reading just to see what would happen.  The story is excellent, and the characters are great, yet the best part is the artwork, artifacts, and very real mysteries that envelope our nations history.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I woke up at 3:30 this morning filled with fear and doubt and found an email from Amazon that this book had been delivered to my computer Kindle. I didn't question the gift and read it straight through. I can't believe it came exactly when I needed to read it. I think you need to be in the middle of creating something to truly appreciate this book. I am and I do. Thank you Steven from the bottom of my heart. Your last chapter completely renewed me by reminding me I chose freely to be in the arena and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Frank Welzig<br /><br />P.S.

0399250573|4.0|My son is in 5th grade and his whole class of boys has been reading this series.  He gets engrossed and finishes in a few days -- he's now disappointed that there are no more to read.  The protagonist is a teenager, so even though he realizes it is unrealistic it is fun for him and has sparked a real interest in espionage and the CIA or FBI.  He'll now read appropriate non-fiction about those topics.  Also, watch the movie Stormchaser if you haven't seen it -- family film that has good action and decent acting.
0525945636|3.0|We typically enjoy Follett's work, and got hooked early in \\"Code\\" on the premise that \\"Luke\\", who awakes in a train station as a homeless man with significant amnesia, soon and cleverly determines not only his identity but the how and why of what happened to him. In so doing, the author traces the man's back story, about two couples who went to Harvard/Radcliffe, and eventually both married, but to the opposite partners from when they dated. We found that thread of the story quite entertaining, especially when Luke begins to question why he picked one woman over the other!<br /><br />The main plot in this period piece, set in the late `50's soon after the Sputnik launch, was whether America's first satellite launch would be successful or rather be sabotaged by Russian spies. What creates considerable suspense is Luke's role in all this and how he must avoid various CIA operatives who should be on his side, but maybe not? The continuing saga of the Radcliffe girls only adds to the intrigue and our own amusement.<br /><br />Follett's typically superb writing style is clearly evident herein, but the book's whole premise seemed a bit far-fetched. That a rocket launch could be susceptible to outside intervention gets tough to swallow - and the chapter headers detailing various aspects of rocket science were distracting at best (just skip them and you won't miss a thing!). All in all, a reasonable spy story, but not necessarily a great addition to the Follett bookshelf.

B0032JTV6U|1.0|As with the buyer/reviewer below, I also received fraud DVDs. I ordered the Glee: The Complete First Season DVD set and I could tell right away when I opened the envelope that the product was fraud. The cover packaging is clearly photo copied. The DVDs have cheap, photocopied pictures on the DVDs (which aren't even the same pictures that are on the real DVDs). The box itself that the DVDs comes in is so cheap it doesn't even close. I have reported a claim against this user about fraud and false advertisement.
0743487486|4.0|Six out of the ten chapters of this book are about what not to do and why.  It should be titled \\"NOT Conditional Parenting.\\"  I'm not sure if I even needed one chapter on this.  I wouldn't have even picked up the book if I didn't know that what I was doing now wasn't working.  This space could have been much better spent on how to apply this philosophy to specific age groups.      Well, okay, I did give it four stars, because the last four chapters were very thought-provoking and have helped me start to raise my son in a more loving and patient manner.  After reading the book I was in a store with my two year old son and my mother.  When it was time to leave, my mom said \\"Let's go Jimmy\\" and when he didn't come right away she said \\"Okay, we're leaving without you.\\"  I was shocked.  I know this is a popular tactic, but it struck me just then at how scary that thought could be for a two-year-old.  I immediately went over to him and helped him say \\"bye-bye\\" to the toys and led him gently out of the store by the hand.      More criticism (Alfie should feel really lucky I gave it four stars):  I resented the use of the term \\"love withdrawal\\" for time-outs.  It's not about taking my love away, but removing him from the situation, stopping a behavior and allowing him to calm down.  It also allows me a break when I'm furious at him.  Whether you agree with time-outs or not, I (ironically) find it a bit manipulative to call it withdrawing love. The author also suggests that you must apply the entire program to get the benefits.  Parenting is not simply applying a philosophy to a blank slate; modification for your own circumstance and child is always necessary.

0307595862|5.0|In my experience with Nordic Crime novels, first there was Steig Larsson, then there was Hakan Nesser, now there is Jo Nesbo.  I'm hooked. They all share the same smart, well-paced, interesting plots and characters - so easy to love for a mystery-thriller buff. The Snowman is the first I've read by this author, but it will not be my last.  It is simply mind-blowing.<br /><br />Our flawed hero, Harry Hole is an inspector who has reputation for drinking a bit too much and being married to his job instead of his girlfriend.  He also happens to be ruggedly handsome, witty, and has the uncanny ability to catch serial killers.  The latest killer is dubbed The Snowman, for the first snow of the season every years leaves not just a snowman but a dead mother.  Harry Hole and his police department are on it.  Together with his new partner, the bright, tough, attractive Katrine Bratt, Hole methodically follows the clues, some of which seem a bit to obvious for the clever Snowman to be leaving. Is the Snowman getting sloppy or is he simply ready to be caught.  It is up to Harry and Katrine to decide before another mother winds up dead.<br /><br />This novel had everything going for it: characters who are interesting, clever plot twists, and some really unique crime scene descriptions.  Add a surprise ending and you'll enjoy this one and want to read the rest by this Jo Nesbo, just like me.

B003UPPO2G|5.0|This is a \\"must have\\" performance for any Bee Gees fan, especially the segment with rocker Celine Dion that kicks it up a few notches. Fortunately this was recorded and preserved for prosperity before Maurice died a few years ago. This \\"newly remastered\\" anniversary version is a definite improvement over the original release on VHS tape and I suggest that you throw out your old copy and replace it immediately. In case you are not aware, it is difficult to find new VHS tapes these days. For a more complete picture of the Bee Gees I also recommend listening to Stevie Ricks who can easily be found on YouTube.

I wanted to see if the film maker offered any kind of verbal or printed apology for making us sit through this terrible movie.<br /><br />Not only did I have to waste nearly two hours of my precious time watching this lame movie, now I owe it to my wife that I'll have to wash her car for her, which will be my way of apologizing to her for wasting her time watching this lousy film with me.<br /><br />Boy, what a big disappointment!

How dare you release an update that doesn't work!\\"<br /><br />I'd rather wait for an update and have it function properly than get the update immediately and have it ruin my game.<br /><br />THANK YOU AMAZON, FOR NOT RELEASING A BUGGY UPDATE!
B003YK42LQ|5.0|Honestly before listening to this album, I wasn't too interested in these guys besides \\"Sex On Fire\\" which against all intentions got stuck in my head.  Then I heard this album at a friends house.  From beginning to end, \\"Come Around Sundown\\" is a powerful experience. It's simplicity, honesty and emotional intensity are undeniably real and immediately compelling.  Haunting lyrics and vocals lead the charge of this family band, but it comes across as a singular sonic force of human expression.  These guys really come together to create beautiful musical landscapes that flow gently from one to the next like an epic journey.  This album is an inspirational artistic achievement, a true American masterpiece.  To all the former fans they seem to have outgrown, open your mind because you're really missing out on a great thing.  Viva rock and roll!
B004X4QW42|4.0|I had long anticipated the release of this film based upon the enjoyment I had for the first IP Man. Number 2 was not a good as number 1 but hardly a boring movie. Unlike number 1, number 2 was filmed in the traditional setting of the 70's vintage Kung Fu movies such as the usual poverty stricken town with gang skirmishes in various places. It had the \\"young toughs\\" fighting and the turf wars, the big bosses controlling the pay for play money and, of course the dramatic lapses of gravity in some of the combat scenes that leave jumping fighters floating a few seconds longer in the air than is actually possible. Delightful in every way for those of us who still enjoy the older movies. But what it didn't have was the authenticity of the first IP Man movie. The rich quality of filming, choreography and acting that set this first film apart from anything of this genre I have ever watched was missing. It also delved heavily into the personal life of Yip Man where scenes of his interaction with family almost compromised the reputation he burned into my mind from the first film. The producers made him personable, approachable and sensitive - less magnanimous. To be honest, it disappointed me. He cried when he discovered his relative, having been shot in the head by the Japanese, had become brain damaged from the wound and did not recognize him.  To be accurate, he was always attentive to his family in IP Man 1 but not warm and mushy. This isn't a bad thing. I just didn't expect it. Still, I watched every moment of IP Man 2 and will watch it again concentrating particularly on the solo hand to hand fighting that has made Donny Yen bigger than life.
1439102724|2.0|I found this book to be sadly cliched and somewhat predictable - the woman who discovers she is gay following a divorce, the ex-husband who decides to 'gift' their embryos to his ex-wife and her wife after he wins custody of them... This was one of her least enjoyable and realistic books for me, and definitely not at the same level as others like Nineteen Minutes.
0316098337|3.0|This was my pick for book club and i had a very hard time getting through it. Thankfully my friends ended up liking it.So just goes to show everyone truly has different taste.
B002E9QSGU|5.0|This is the original 2005 edition of the field guide based on the book series. Another edition was released in 2008, as a movie tie-in edition. I much prefer this edition that is specific to the book series, and if you are a fan of the Spiderwick series of books more than the movie, this is the one to get. It is very detailed, the art is wonderful. It is \\"written\\" by Arthur Spiderwick and is intended to be the guide that is discovered in the books. We have really enjoyed this. This version is much harder to find, but there are tons of copies of the movie version if you prefer that.
B001992NUQ|5.0|You have probably heard of Fight Club, the 1999 film that is regarded has a cult hit and one of the most quoted and re-enacted movies of contemporary times. Not only is it a popular film, but it is also an amazing one. Edward Norton plays a depressed \\"The Narrator\\" (who is never named throughout the whole entire film) looking to get away from his daily routine and insomnia.     The Narrator is played to perfection by Edward Norton. He brings the character to life, and playing some one depressed, that is a hard job. Brad Pitt is amazing and could be his best role. When you watch Helena Bonham Carter you'll see why she always play roles like these; she's perfect. The cinematography is dark and run down, just what you would expect from David Fincher. Most of the sets will stay with, like the apartment, the house in which Tyler and The Narrator stay in, and the bar that Fight Club goes on in. The writing is voracious and almost hard to swallow, which is how it was made. The story focuses on agression and civilization and how it should be torn down. The twist at the end of the story is famous, and the plot is smart and instantaneous, keeping viewers hooked.    It falls nothing short of it's reputation. David Fincher has exceeded all, and so has the cast.

It's such an inspiration
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|A tale that focuses on life and death with no fulfilling answers as the end but I think that was intentional.  Overall, this film was introspective but it dragged too much.  I was able to handle about 40 minutes before turning it off.  WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011; MY GRADE: C to C plus.
B0006B3UEQ|1.0|Beware of this firm, their US branch forwards overstocked DVD's from the U.K., what you probably will not notice is the DVD's are playable only in \\"Region 2\\", the UK and Europe.  The DVD you receive will not play in the US or on US (Region 1) players.  Most of us are used to dealing with USA vendors who are reputable businesses, not people who deliberately and knowingly send out items that they well know will not function.  I recommend you avoid this firm a at all costs.

B004SBX112|5.0|This game is addiction its fun and requires thought and concentration its a brilliant way to burn time.  I always look forward to new versions.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I am totally amazed that anyone would give this movie 5 stars. I did not see the movie in the theater, rather I waited for the DVD so I could watch it closer to the release of part 2.  If a person watched it without reading the book, they'd have no idea what half the plotlines were about.  The whole \\"searching for the wand Voldy flashbacks\\", and the addition of more than one wand maker, was very confusing for the members of my family who hadn't read the books but had seen all the previous movies. Personally this movie needed either more dialog or a narrator IMO. It was ok, but I prefer the earlier movies when more of the book was included. To me, the later books (5,6,7) aren't really \\"movie material\\" without a narrator.  Look at LOR, they did a great job on those movies by having a narrator introduce the complicated plot lines at the beginning, so a viewer had a guide as they watched (and a clue). For readers of the books, this movie was OK. For people who just wanted to continue the series on screen and haven't read the books, not so good.
B004SBX112|1.0|lame that it is almost easter and there still isnt an update.  amazon needs to resolve the lack of updates if they want to be a competitor with google's market.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is a great, fast-paced read. It keeps you turning the pages but the narrative arch is somewhat predictable. Don't get me wrong; it makes for an entertaining and light read, but it keeps you wanting for more depth.
B00005JPCF|1.0|Where is the zero stars option? Is it possible to \\"unwatch\\" a movie? I actually felt embarrassed for the people who made this movie. Even my wife, who never reads politics into movies and just enjoys them, thought it was a heavy-handed propaganda piece. I really can't think of any redeeming quality from this film to put on the plus side, other than the penguins being cute. But you can see that in \\"March of the Penguins\\" while enjoying the natural world and avoiding all the proselytizing. This is the only DVD we've thrown away rather than donate it to the local library; we didn't want to inflict it upon anyone else.
B004G600A4|5.0|Rapunzel is one of the stories collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812.  The original \\"fairy tale\\" is hardly suitable subject matter for a Disney movie, but, as Disney tends to do, the story was adapted extensively for a modern family audience.  The result is a marvelous entertaining fantasy that is enjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />Mother Gothel kidnaps baby Rapunzel from her parents' room.  Gothel needs access to Rapunzel's hair because it has the ability to keep her young.  To maintain control over Rapunzel, Mother Gothel keeps her at the top of a high tower hidden in the mountains.  However, Rapunzel can see the world outside her window and her greatest fantasy is to see the flying lanterns that appear every year, strangely enough, on her birthday.  Things come to a head on Rapunzel's 18th birthday, when thief Flynn Rider comes into Rapunzel's life by scaling the wall of the tower.<br /><br />At first, this strange person frightens Rapunzel because of the stories Mother Gothel told her about the cruel and evil world outside the tower.  However, Rapunzel's desire to see the lanterns drives her to take charge of Flynn Rider as her guide to the source of the lanterns.  What follows is one of the fastest and funniest Disney animated features.<br /><br />Rapunzel, outstandingly voiced by Mandy Moore, charms everyone she meets.  She is usually cheerful and funny.  Though she is naïve, she is also smart and clever.  She is also physically fit.  I guess there is little to do in the tower except work out.  She is also quite dexterous with her hair.<br /><br />Does Rapunzel make it to the launching of the lanterns?  Will Flynn Rider change his moderately wicked ways?  Will Mother Gothel have justice visited upon her?  What about the horse that acts like a bloodhound (you have to watch to understand - the horse is hilarious)?  You will have to watch this clever, funny, fast and charming movie to find out!<br /><br />This DVD has a dearth of extras, somewhat unusual when comparing this release against other recent Disney releases.  There are two alternate beginnings along with an explanation of both and a countdown of Disney's first 50 animated movie releases.  While this stuff is interesting, it is hardly earth shattering.  I suspect Disney is holding out more extras for a special release of some sort.  Oh well, another clever way to make money I guess.<br /><br />Disney has a good track record with its animated features.  This one is a winner and is already a favorite with our family.<br /><br />Enjoy!lease against other recent Disney releases.

B002RLBKPO|5.0|Dead eye Dick gives us that unique perspective that everything in life isn't exactly as it seems... even when you pull the trigger of a gun and arbitrarily kill a pregnant woman. Both sad and funny, and so honest, the way only Vonnegut can be honest.
B004MGMJ3E|4.0|Tomboy definitely isn't Person Pitch, and though I do prefer Person Pitch overall, Tomboy demands just as much respect. Tomboy is signature Panda Bear style in the way of the droning vocals, but here the \\"droning\\" aspect expands into the music as well. It is a definitely a peaceful album, almost to the point where it creates a floating feeling. All the tracks are worth listening to, but the standouts are \\"Last Night at the Jetty\\", \\"Slow Motion\\", \\"Scheherazade\\", and \\"Afterburner\\". Definitely check this one out. Now when's the next Animal Collective album coming out...
B004IM14RY|5.0|While on a job in Iraq, civilian contractor Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is attacked and kidnapped, then awakens to find himself buried alive in the middle of the desert with nothing but a lighter, a candle, a cell phone and a knife. Does Paul have the instincts he'll need to save himself? Director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s crafts a tense psychological thriller with sociopolitical undertones that doubles as an exercise in claustrophobic terror.Ryan Reynolds delivered an amazing performance. He really showed what a great actor he is. I'm amazed that a movie that takes place entirely inside a box was so entertaining. That statement is a major tribute to Ryan Reynolds, Rodrigo Cortes, and Chris Sparling. I'm happy Lionsgate picked this up.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|According to the Blu-ray disc Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will be released in theaters on July 15th and if that isn't enough it will be released in 3-D as well. That should make for a really grand finish to the series. Part 1 is a generally exciting film that holds one's attention very well. Although the section where the three are on the run may seem to slow down the pace, the movie tracks the book pretty well and these scenes provide an opportunity to reveal the emotions with which each of them must deal.<br /><br />I've noticed some negative comments on sound and picture and have just replayed the opening part with the sole intention of evaluating the sound and picture; the results are conclusive, they are both outstanding. The surround speakers are given a terrific workout and the subwoofer is nicely exercised as well. I would give both sound and picture top marks for excellence. The picture is crisp and clear and never too dark so as to mask the action.<br /><br />I would agree that if one had not read the book it could be more difficult to follow the story's turns and twists. If one has not read the book this would be a great time to do just that. I believe it was better to divide the book into two parts so the story could be more systematically covered. I hope the release of the Blu-ray 3D version will not be delayed too long after the movie is released in theaters.<br /><br />In summary, this is an outstanding movie version of the first part of the book and provides a solid platform for the completion of the story. I'm delighted to have this movie as a part of my collection.
B004SBX112|5.0|They finally release the update. Go get it now. At least they make it available before easter, so all of us can enjoy it .

B004DC2WPM|5.0|This series rocks. It's got that gritty human melodrama mixed in with the undead's digestive track. Perfect for those times when you need something to spice up your own outlook on life.
B004GYY714|5.0|Stumbled across this somehow and am glad I did. While local radio isn't a big deal to me it quickly found all my &quot;local&quot; stations without issue. But, seriously? Forget that. Start browsing around and listen to stuff outside your home country. Listened to a bunch of stations in Romania for a while, for no particular reason than that we could.<br /><br />Have encountered a few stations that, while listed, don't play. Now who knows why this is? Perhaps the stations streaming server has issues? Maybe they somehow blocked TuneIn from accsessing it? I don't hold it against the app though; just part of online life in my book!<br /><br />Know that several stations still continue to stream fine even when my phone drops down to 1x on Verizon. So to those complaining about buffering and such, it's either your connection and/or the stations streaming bit rate is more than your connection wants to deal with. Once again, AFAIK, not the apps fault.<br /><br />Really happy with it. Sleep timer is great as I use it every night to help me pass out. Has an alarm setting too; haven't played with that yet. Presets seem to work fine too... and that's a good thing.
B000002OX7|5.0|I vividly remember the first time I heard this album - almost 40 years ago, at a crowded college party.  I imediately bought the album and played it constantly for the next year.  I knew (and mostly still know) every word to every song.   Baba O Reilly was the ultimate anthem for me as college girl of 18, and it still grabs me today.  I've owned this in vinyl, cassette, CD, and recently downloaded it to my I Pod.    What strikes me now is what a complete collection it was.  Then, as now, you may like 2 or 3 songs on an album and the rest are just filler. That certainly isn't the case for Who's Next.    I was also fascinated to find, in reading the reviews the preceeded mine, that Who's Next was really made up of leftovers from a failed project.  I had never heard that, and it now just adds more meaning to the songs I've been listening to for all of these years.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|SAW: THE FINAL CHAPTER (aka: SAW 3D and SAW 7) is actually an excellent finish to the grisly series. Many loose ends are tied up in bloody knots, and some old characters return, including Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes)! This time, Hoffman is on the ultimate rampage, willing to do anything to bring down his vengeance on Jill. Meanwhile, a self-help guru is using his alleged \\"survival\\" of one of Jigsaw's traps in order to sell books and become rich. This is, of course, a big mistake, leading to a crash-course in attitude adjustment! S:TFC is a maniacal thriller in it's own right, w/ a definite sense of balls-out insanity! Now, regardless of this being called the \\"final\\" SAW film, I wouldn't be surprised to see a few more. Why? Well, the ending could easily lead to a further story, and it's been done before (remember FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 4: THE FINAL CHAPTER?). Anyway, I'll probably be watching another one of these at some future date...
B004K4IZ54|5.0|What an amazing experience, watching Tron in 3D Blu-Ray!! The picture was awesome, the sound was awesome, and the 3D technology was awesome.<br />We keep watching it over and over again! And I am a huge movie collector...<br />Also, I find it beneficial that the set comes with the regular Blu-Ray as well. This way my family can borrow it, or I can watch it in a different room.<br />Well worth the price!! 100% recommended!!

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS JUST BUY THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!! but in general the book was just a remake of the harry potter movies nothing special about it.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|Yet another Free App Of The Day and was curious. Runs fine (original Moto Droid) and looks great... but just not that amazingly interesting. Fun to play as a diversion from other games now and then... my four year old son loves it... but not a go to game for me. By the way, does support two finger multi-touch. Ambidexterious slicing is kind of amusing. ;-)
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|AC/DC's Black Ice is a terrific rock album.  It's big, dumb, loud rock, all in straight 4/4 time.  It's the way a rock album ought to be.  These guys are geniuses in that they don't over think rock.  Too many rockers want to talk about their emotions and make rock intellectual.  If you want intellectual, listen to jazz or classical.  People, rock is by nature a dumb medium--it's not meant for deep thought.  It's a loud, brainless music meant for partying and kicking butt.  Rock isn't for \\"feelings.\\"  Duh!  These guys get that; few others do.

0817439390|5.0|Exposure is almost the most important thing in photography in my opinion. As most of photography-lovers know, aperture, ISO, and shutter speed are the three key elements in this art of job. When you try to take a picture whatever it is, snap-shot or great image, to tune these parameters are indispensible to your success of keeping precious memeory. Sometimes you need not too low shutter speed to keep clear image in the dark environment, which requires a little higher ISO so more details can be left on the image-sensor. Setting Aperture to f/1.4 is good to get brighter main body in your focus, yet the background becomes visional. These three sometimes is trade-off to each other. The better you understand them, the better ability when you shoot your pictures by using various lens under different circumstances. The book tells you a lot about these three things with a lot of pictures as explanation. If you have time and money just take this book. You will not be disappointed.
B000KW6HN2|5.0|There's a love story here. One that proves love in and of itself is more important than money. It's too bad Larry had to lose his legs to find it. Great movie. One of my all time favorites
B002RKSV2U|5.0|Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote \\"On the Origin of Species\\".  He is, without a doubt, one of the most infuential people in human history, and his thoughts have helped shape the world we live in today.  Whether you believe in evolution or not, every well informed person should know and understand Darwin's arguments for transmutations of species.  This book is remarkable for its lasting influence on the current worldview of those who believe in science.
B000P0J09C|4.0|Full Metal Jacket is one movie that I will recommend to any person that doesn't mind a lot of swearing. It takes place in the first half in a Marine boot camp where the drill sergeant is teaching the soldiers everything they need to know to be a Marine. He gives everyone punishment for someone's screw up, except the guy who did it. Then the group beats him with pillow cases filled with soap!  The next setting is the actual battle ground. I won't give anything away on this scene, but be prepared--it is gruesome. I would give this movie a 4 out of 5.  It is outdated a little bit, but still awesome.
B0029LHW4A|4.0|I don't know why this album didn't get more press than it did.  It's one of the best albums that's been released in the past few years.  Great songs, great sound, great lyrics and great playing.  Jet has always seemed to get a knocked because \\"their sound is a derivative\\"...whatever that means.  As if anything today isn't.  All of the songs on this album are well-written, catchy and fun to listen to.  They aren't solving the world's problems or re-inventing music....they are, however, putting out some of the best rock and roll music coming out right now, and growing organically as opposed to seeing the latest trends and doing an about-face to try to cash in.  And for that, they deserve a lot of credit.  In the context of the state of music today, this album deserves 5 stars.  In the context of all of the brilliant musicians and song-writers in music history - it holds up pretty well too.
0618918248|5.0|Prof. Dawkins' book God Delusion is worth more than one reading. He clearly lays out major religious fallacies and refutes them all step by step, using proven scientific methods, relying on logic, reasoning, and facts. He is not only very knowledgeable but a truly courageous man. Highly recommended, especially to those who inherited their parents' religion.
B0041KKYEW|1.0|Don't get me wrong: I like Natalie Portman. But in this movie she does not act and she didn't dance either. She is linear, one-dimensional and utterly boring. An Oscar for this? Oh, but she lost lots of weight for this role, right. And her face looked really tortured and repulsive with all those grimaces.<br /><br /> The movie itself is actually painfully boring and extremely predictable--from the very first minute. What a waste of my time.<br /><br />Beyond the boredom, I found two things quite embarrassing:<br />1. The red eyes sequences (no comment...); and<br />2. The obvious--and quite desperate--\\"inspiration\\" from other movies, especially from Haneke's \\"Piano Teacher\\" when it comes to Nina's relationship with her mother (for example).<br /><br />Now talking about Haneke: Aronofksy is no Haneke. No way. Not in this world. There is a million years distance between the two of them. Aronofky doesn't have Haneke's tension, angst, despair and deep knowledge and understanding of human tragedy, and of human condition, in general. Therefore, his movie is just a (poor) caricature.<br /><br />But the music is fine, hence the one star and the review, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. I am not a reading person but once I began readin these I could not stop. The HBO series, just started and I enjoyed it so much (Thank you HBO for having a free weekend) Although it is not following the book exactly and many die hard followers will notice these small differences, I think having Martin there to suppervise and take creative care of his story is amazing. My only issue is it feels as if the story is almost rushed, like they are trying to push through it. bottom line is I will buy the blue ray season of this show, I would watch it, if I had HBO. The books are AMAZING and the TV series is not to far off, worth watching.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|They took a great story and turned it into a medicore movie.    First there are tons of historical inaccuracies, for some reason this movie supports the old confederate myth that Mary Surratt was hanged because of the rage of the North over Lincoln's killing and was innocent.  Read the excellent books American Brutus, Blood on the Moon, or Manhunt and you will get a much clearer idea of her role in the conspiracy which was considerable.  She blatantly lied to the detectives investigating the case.  Another thing the movie totallly misses in once you join a criminal conspiracy you become responsible for whatever happens even if you didn't intend for some of the things to happen.  That was true then and is true today.    Although not in the movie Robert Redford said on the today show that Surratt hung for five minutes before dying, absolutely not, she died instantly, Powell hung for five minutes before dying.  Again the old confederate retelling of the tale.    The movie misses a lot of great theatric monents that are historically accurate, like Powell's defense of her at the gallows, and her conversation about her bindings hurting her before she was hung (she was told it wouldn't hurt for long).  The acting by Wright is excellent but everyone else is pretty bad.      The biggest personality in this case was Booth and the movie really errs in its portrayal of him as just another conspirator, he was the most famous actor of his day, a very handsome and dashing individual with a total reckless disregard for his safety.    I think the true importance of Lincoln's assasination is one of the most overlooked aspects of American History, it was pivotal event in the history of our country which to a certain extent reversed the confederate defeat in the war.  The emotions at the time were about 100 times as intense as after 9/11.  People were hung just because they looked like Booth or said they didn't mind Lincoln being dead.  Mary Surrant was one of the leaders of the conspiracy, there really isn't any doubt about it.
B004G6009U|5.0|Disney ha hecho un excelente trabajo en la película Tangled (Enredados), imágenes de alta definición y excelente sonido con una trama original bien adaptada a la actualidad.    Recomiendo este video como parte de su colección.    Saludos
0743200799|5.0|This is a must read for anyone interested in first hand details of the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, especially those personally involved. Kranz is about 10 years my senior and Gemini was underway when I graduated from college and began my engineering career in the Propellants Section of Saturn V Launch Operations at KSC. After facility activation and the second unmanned Saturn V (AS502) launch I moved to Houston and worked at JSC as a Space Suit Engineer for ILC Industries through the remainder of the Apollo program. So I saw it first hand from both the launch vehicle and astronaut viewpoints. Many books and articles I have read about this incredible period in American history do not get the facts straight and the exhilarating/dejecting emotions involved but Kranz personnel knowledge and writing skill nails it in this book. As a matter of fact his account so parallels my own that I am using it as a guide to write my memoirs. A great read and historical reference.

0307593495|5.0|I am rather new to Kurt Wallander. I have read three of his books and then went right to 'The Troubled Man'. Now, I must go back and catch up, though that is not really needed. This is a stand alone book. What I discovered is that this character, Kurt Wallander is leaving us. Towards the end of the book, he writes down his own version of the story we have just read. It is very complex, he intends to send his account anonymously to the Stockholm colleague in charge of the case they have been working on. Kurt Wallander is a Swedish police detective, in rural Ystad. In this novel he explores the relationship between the state, Swedish parliament and the military. Wallander has another motive for looking at his past. He fears old age will force him to stop working, and his physical and mental lapses are worrisome. He remembers his father's descent into dementia.<br /><br />Kurt Wallander's daughter, Linda, has become pregnant and her significant other, Han's parents have invited him to a birthday party. Kurt and Han's father, Hakan von Enke, hit it off. Hakan is a former commander in the Swedish navy who specialized in both commanding and hunting down submarines. He goes on to tell Kurt a story of Russian submarines, and one that was found in suspicious circumstances. Later Hakan goes missing and then the real mystery develops. Wallander's investigation reveals deep family secrets and quite a bit about recent Swedish naval history. The mystery is fascinating, but the final few sentences left me quite upset, even though the signs were there all along. The book was so well done, but ultimately, saddened that there would be no more in this series and sad at the way it ended.<br /><br />Wallander does not seem to be a particularly happy person, and working on his own, during his summer holiday, there is time for a review of his life. He thinks about his relationships with Linda, his ex-wife Mona and other people that meant something to him. There are also references to earlier cases and there is a sense of all loose ends having been tied up. Hanning Mankell is a superb writer of mystery. He gives us detail that is significant, and the story widens into one of surprises and reminiscence. Kurt Wallander is a man that I feel I know, and now it is difficult to let him go.  Will Kurt's daughter, Linda get a chance to tell her tales?<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 04-20-11<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400095824 The Pyramid: The First Wallander Cases (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0440240425 A Bridge to the Stars]]there is a sense of all loose ends having been tied up.

B004OEMRGI|5.0|I've been patiently waiting quite a while for this release, and I can gladly say its well worth it. Bombino has firmly planted himself at the forefront of what may currently be, a golden age of Saharan guitar music. The foundational sound palate set by Tinariwen is further expanded and defined, not only by Bombino and his fellow musicians' performance, but also in the recording quality itself. I really enjoy the music coming out of new-millennium Tuareg culture and if you do as well, this recording is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL!
B004SBX112|1.0|After repeated attempts, I have been unable to overwrite the free version of Angry Birds Seasons with this paid version - it just keeps installing a second instance of the program, which doesn't show any of my scores or unlocks. When I asked Amazon for help, they just gave me a refund for the paid version without offering any suggestion for how to fix it.<br /><br />Just one more reason, along with the fact that there is STILL no Easter update for the appstore version, to never use the Amazon Appstore again. If I had bought this from the Android market in the first place, I would have exactly what I'm looking for right now.<br /><br />Speaking of reasons to dislike the Amazon Appstore, why is there no way to uninstall apps once you've downloaded them??

0316154687|3.0|Nothing on the cover portrays this is book as homosexual literature to the unsuspecting<br />straight buyer.  Perhaps a well-written book on coming out, that is, if you can stand the nauseating omnipresence of the author as he works his way through his banal experiences of choosing to be gay.  A delightful moment does occurs early on that in spite of the author's constant presence in the narrative, you start to wonder as to the gender of the first person.<br /><br />Was it too much trouble to caution the buyer that this odyssey of mental masturbation<br />might not be what they are looking for ? Or, has politically correct culture and savvy marketing rendered this notion pass&eacute;.  Perhaps the best value for this work is as  gift for that person you know who has yet to open the letter waiting for them on their dresser-letting them that know that yes, they are gay.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Robbie Robertson's first solo album in a decade? Worth the wait!    Robertson's solo albums have always struck me as more 'atmospheric' and 'portentous' than the Band's masterpieces. I can't put my finger on it. Perhaps it's throaty whisper-singing, perhaps it's the lyrics. Perhaps it's the theatricality of them all. Check out the first song of his first solo album - Fallen Angel, to see what I mean: the delayed start worthy of Pink Floyd, the falsetto whispery lead-in and that glorious angelic chorus that makes you want to throw back your head and join in with your eyes closed.    Well, the good news is that How to Become Clairvoyant offers more of the same. Age has not withered Mr. Robertson's talents. He has said in interviews that this is probably the most personal album he's ever made. It also features some of the classiest rock guitar playing I've heard in a long time - subtle, nothing in your face, perfectly fitting each song. The throaty whisper is intact and the fingerwork is as reliable as ever. He has sterling help from fellow old fogies Eric Clapton - who co-wrote a couple of songs and offers up a wonderful lesson in class on an instrumental bluesy Madame X a little past the half way mark on the album - and Steve Winwood, and a line-up of current rockers like Trent Reznor, Tom Morello and others.    Robertson's lyrical strengths are also firmly intact - 'we had dreams when the night was young' and 'I was only trying to make the right mistake' are cases in point. The whole album has a solid, yet laid-back feel to it. No pulsing beats and show-off guitar solos. Just some classic bluesy rock like they don't make any more. And there's never a dull moment. Surprises pop up, like the twangy lead guitar in He Don't Live Here No More or the fiery fretwork in Axman.    He Don't Live Here No More? Glad he still does.
0553593714|5.0|I picked up 'A Game of Thrones' to read during the pre-hype of the launching for the HBO series. At first, I was unsure if I liked it because of the brutal live-or-die medieval setting and the somewhat harsh treatment of women. Soon enough, the book opened up to me and I became involved in the lives of all the different characters. Martin does a great job of giving you many different points-of-view, many of which are children ages 8-14. Each character is neither good nor evil, they each fill a different shade of gray on the spectrum of morality. You want to hate the 'evil' characters, but when you least expect it, they act surprisingly humane and thoughtful. Similarly, the 'good' characters are quite uncaring and cold when you least expect it. As a woman, I did get thrown off sometimes at how certain women are treated in the book. I had to remind myself that it is consistent with the medieval setting. There are also plenty strong, defiant women in the book to make up for it. It would be another story if this was not so. If you're interested in the HBO show, I recommend reading the novel first because it is so much richer and packed with emotion. I'm even now reading the second novel, A Clash of Kings!
1856697061|4.0|There are a lot of interesting designs in this book. I look forward to figuring out how to create them.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I just saw this and wow what a fantastic movie.  Hereafter is beautifully done.  The characters are extremely developed and three dimensional.  The actors brought incredible depth and emotion to their characters and no doubt with the assistance of a great director like Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />A sophisticated individual who thinks for themselves will love this film.  Those that delve deep into life will love this film.  All others will not as its too complex and nothing gets blown up except for a powerful opening sequence involving a Tsunami.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised to find the onslaught of negative reviews.  I thought for sure everyone loved this too.  I've come to the conclusion that the negative reviews are from those that were expecting some kind of pointless blockbuster.  This is not a fast paced action film involving a cast that looks like cardboard models.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to those that are looking for a well crafted and intelligent film.  Those that are young, limited or particular will not like this.  Unfortunately those were the ones that reviewed the film here giving it one star.  Anyone that gave this kind of a film one star needs to stick to teeny-bopper films.  This one is way over your head.
0553381695|4.0|Just slightly less compelling than the first book.  Great characters, complex story, and Tyrion is absolutely fantastic in this book.  Highly recommended.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|What a great CD! I am always reluctant to purchase an entire CD, but I am so glad I did.
0307454541|3.0|While I don't regret having read this book I must say that I didn't really get what all the hype was about. I thought all the \\"twists\\" were completely predictable. Once I figured out who the characters were (which took the first 100 pages to piece completely together) I had 100% accurately guessed where the book was leading. I never contemplated not finishing the book so I can say that I found it at least entertaining enough to read, but it was definitely not the sensational novel that I was expecting. I just started The Girl Who Played With Fire and so far I'm finding it much more enjoyable than this first book.

B0034G4ORM|5.0|This movie is possibly the best science fiction alien invasion movie, ever! The acting isn't bad, special effects are great, and it's unique compared to other alien invasion flicks. How so? Well, the aliens actually FIGHT, on the ground even! They aren't just appearing in ships frying everything in sight and they even show personality (they use tactics in battle and even try and save their wounded!). People ripping this movie apart for it being nothing but fighting need to have some sense put in them. This film is a science fiction film! Same thing for those of you who are so obsessed with \\"dramatic\\" acting. This is a science fiction movie, not The Notebook! It's like if I was going to go see Bambi and tore the movie apart for not having a fight scene. Movies are aimed at certain audiences. Any alien invasion film that goes deep into the characters' past/lives or does what critics want would be a horrible alien invasion film! I don't care about character A having a mid life crises or about character B's daughter with an eating disorder. I go to see a movie called Battle: Los Angeles to see some good ol' fashioned fighting! This movie does not disappoint and rather than it being a movie were the entirety of the human fight is based of the Air Force, this movie goes into what we learned in the early days of aviation development. That is, you cannot win a war by controlling the air alone. You want Earth? You're going to have to control the ground. This movie even requires the aliens to know how to fight because FOR ONCE the aliens don't have force-fields that protect them from anything and everything we fire at them. It's an actual battle for once! This movie was so original in the alien invasion genre that it ticks me off the these \\"critics\\" rip the film apart because there was no love story. Bottom line, if you like war or alien invasion movies then you'll love this one! If you don't like those kind of movies, you might still like it, but why are you even thinking ofwatching this then?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Collins did a great job of tying in the theme of the Hunger Games to the war that has erupted in Panem.  In effect, the Rebellion's battle are the Hunger Games.  I loved the edge the leaders of the Rebellion teetered on as their actions mirrored the horrors the Capitol were guilty of.  I love how the book stayed with only Katniss' perspective of the war.  It makes the effects of battle really become personal and real.  There were twists and turns and an ending that ultimately satisfies.
B004SBX112|5.0|I have been holding off from commenting,I was sure the update would be in by now. I do so like the game and got the ad free version without paying (thank you amazon).But it is kinda crazy that the update is taking so long.Would be good to hear from someone at amazon as to what is going on.
055357342X|4.0|This book was a little slow in the middle but really picks back up by the end. The twists are great and this fantastic story remains very interesting.
1594202842|4.0|Amy Chua has ignited an important debate regarding the effects of parental expectations on children's intellectual accomplishments. She makes clear throughout her book that she values success in academics and achievement in classical music over the more mainstream American obsession with social acceptance and popularity. Displaying irony, wit, and humor, Chua admits on nearly every page that she was overzealous at times in her pursuit of excellence for her children. While some readers may view her disapproval of play dates and sleepovers as neurotically strict, I find it understandable since this culture often allows socially dominant children to gain too much power over their peers. Children who have learned self-discipline and intellectual focus may become immune to the influence of the louche, lazy, or obnoxious kids prevalent in many middle and high schools. We have all had enough of the witchy queen bee, the slothful pothead, and the brutal wolfish bully. Whether readers agree or disagree with Chua, her memoir incites them to examine the ways in which parental authority shapes children's values.    While Chua realizes the flaws in her parenting method, she demonstrates far less awareness of the status anxiety and social snobbery that plague many of her attitudes and actions. As a tenured professor at Yale who has written two well-regarded books in her field, she belongs to a cultural elite whose economic and social privileges far exceed those of most Americans. Since she knows these privileges are hard to gain and maintain, she is determined with a vengeance to keep them. One of the ways that she secures her upper class status is by enabling her children to succeed in high cultural pursuits that may be out of reach for those from less privileged backgrounds. In Chua's world, composers such as Bartok, Kodaly, and Prokofiev are status markers as powerful as Yale, Harvard, and Princeton. On the one hand, Chua's love for classical music is evident in her willingness to learn complex scores in order to supervise her daughters' practice sessions. Yet music is also an area in which she exerts a great deal of economic and social clout by securing for Sophia and Lulu distinguished teachers and prestigious venues in Europe as well as in New York City. Chua's status anxiety and snobbery are also hilariously evident in her disdain for the pet rabbits that she considered fat, lazy, and stupid. She made sure that the fancy dogs she eventually acquired came from a breed noted for its beauty, elegance, and preternatural intelligence. Of course, Chua was dead set on helping her Samoyeds maximize their natural cognitive gifts, since in her social context intelligence is the basis of status.    I believe that many readers find Chua annoying because her concern with status fuels their own feelings of social competitiveness. When reading her book, they may begrudgingly wonder if what is good enough for her should be good enough for them. While Americans need to raise the intellectual standards that we set for all of our children, we must also be aware of the extent to which education and the arts are often used as status weapons. Unfortunately, when weak academic standards and undisciplined behavior are cultural norms, intelligence and education become significant social markers for the educated upper middle class. Chua knows this -- if only on an intuitive level -- and she capitalizes on it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really wasn't sure what direction this book was going to go, other than the inkling that a rebellion was likely brewing in Panem.  When Katniss is cast into another Hunger Games, I was worried that we were just going to re-hash the same plot.  Boy, was I wrong!  This book took a spectacular, twisted turn.  The author managed to provide enough complexity and difference in these Hunger Games to keep the plot intriguing.  A page turner, indeed!  A cliff-hanger of an ending!  Be ready to buy book 3!
B00110K62U|3.0|Audio was not state of the art. When played on our  home theatre the sound only played from the center speaker. we thoroughly enjoyed the video  presentation on the big screen.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I wished I'd seen this at Rave Theater. I'm positive it was extremely exiting on the big screen.<br />The 3 disc set is excellent for its alternating opening, 45 min of deleted scenes and a documentary of James Cameron visiting an area that's being eliminated due to heavy water power plants being built that will flood the homeland of the indigenous people there. ( the whole reason behind the movie )<br />VERY informative. I've watched this movie approx 20 times and I'm still not sick of it yet. this Movie takes Sci-fi to a whole new level.<br />if you ever want to save the description \\"eye candy\\" to make a point to your friends that haven't seen it yet, use it for this movie.<br />there is (in my opinion) 2 parts I liked the best. the chase of the Thanator and when Neytiri and Jake 1st fly their Ecklan together.(Banshee) It makes you wish you could have one to ride. I give this movie 5 Stars hands down.<br />Youtube *Avatar Movie Trailer HD*
B0042EJD8A|4.0|This movie is well-done; very low key but also a little scary at times.  There has been a lot of news about hydrofracking lately, and much of it confirms the things said in this movie.

B004L03B3S|4.0|.....The Heart Loves Who the Heart MUST Love!     (( A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY INVOLVING HALF-BROTHERS ))   - AN EXPLANATION ABOUT THIS FILM'S BEGINNING: Concerning The \\"Eyes Thing\\" in the film's first 2 minutes, there is a reason for the opening Black+White scene....and it has nothing to do with equipment failure....and everything to do with a newborn baby's failure (actually, unwillingness) to open his eyes. ....Until 2 weeks later, when he is shown to...and becomes aware of his older brother's presence (that's the eye-opening trigger). Let's just say about this that there is some foreshadowing here of the depth of the \\"brotherly Relationship\\" which is to come.  (( NOTE--Now is a good time to advise that you read a marvelous 35 year old novel by Spanish author, Agustin Gomez-Arcos, entitled \\"[[ASIN:B0044KMRCG The Carnivorous Lamb (Little Sister's Classics)]]\\" (included in some \\"Gay Must-Read\\" recommended works). Here, you'll also find a detailing of the deep and physical love which develops between an older and younger brother. It is a beautiful read...and also begins with the \\"Eyes Thing.\\" Perhaps Writer / Director Aluisio Abranches is, himself, a fan of this book. ))  - TIME PERIODS GIVEN US ARE 2: The brothers' early lives, \\"growing closer together\\" as children and young teens....Then, later on, their adult \\"Relationship\\", when the younger is, perhaps 20, and the older in his mid-20s or so.  - GENERAL OBSERVATIONS: It was UNexpected (and a problem for me) that so much time is devoted to \\"family life\\" in the film's first half.....particularly since it is problem-free (I rated film lower for this). Oh, and for those of you inclined to do the \\"blame-it-on-the-Mother\\" thing for the type \\"Relationship\\" you'll be seeing...just don't. As well, both the older brother's father (mother's divorced Ex) and the younger brother's father (mother's current) have close relationships with the boys...and with their mother (a woman who is, indeed, a lynchpin in the boys' lives). Moving on, we are given many, many scenes of the children's \\"innocent\\" physical closeness and touching---I can recall no shots in which they were not shown together. One scene, particularly, comes to mind: A quiet time with 3 of them relaxed on a sofa, the younger boy asleep against his brother's side and under his arm, the mother holding her eldest's hand while stating to him her love for them both....but then suddenly asking how things are going with the son (he responds as if thinking her meaning involves school). Then she corrects her question, saying she means....how are things going for himself. After receiving his answer of \\"no problems,\\" she continues to press, and does so by asking \\"that question\\" which so many sons would just as soon never came up: \\"IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL ME?\\" (For me it is easy to surmise that, at his then age of 14 or so, the real meaning behind her question would likely escape him....for he eventually responds in the negative). Still, the subject of this \\"Closeness\\" between the 2 boys comes up again and is discussed between the mother and her Ex...though no course of action to confront it is ever arrived at by any parent.  - NEVERTHELESS: Be that as it may, \\"Closeness\\" usually has to lead somewhere....does it not? So....following their mother's unexpected death, when the brothers are likely in their early and later 20s, respectively, IT HAPPENS. We've reached a point where we are made witness to a most unusual and sexually provocative scene. A scene in which....while alone in their home....standing before and facing one another....they begin a slow and sensual disrobing, one item at a time....each one's eyes intently locked on the other, as if caught in a spell.....until, finally, they step into each others arms. (You WON'T forget this shot...probably one of a kind). AND, don't dare push that button and go away(!)....for immediately following, and without giving you time to cool down, you'll be treated to a stunningly beautiful, bedroom lovemaking scene. One in which love, each for the other, is declared. Then, in their afterglow, we are given a mantra for this unusual love of theirs (a love which, in reality, harms no others). The younger brother states to his beloved...and us: \\"I LOVE YOU BECAUSE, TO UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE, THEY'D NEED TO TURN THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN!\\" ....There is little else for this viewer to say...other than there has never been a more beautiful painting of 2 men, together, than the camera gives us in this scene. (I won't even tempt you with descriptions of the bathroom scene which follows....other than to say: HOT!!).  - NOTABLE: Both adult leads are beautiful men.....well chosen for their roles. Particularly Joao Gabriel Vasconcellos, as elder brother, Francisco (who makes us \\"feel\\" his love and his loss).....but, also, Rafael Cardoso as the adult younger brother, Thomas, who lightens our hearts, as he does Francisco's. (The 2 young actors pictured in earlier childhood do a bang-up job, as well). /// Older stars portraying both the fathers and, especially Julia Lemmertz, as Mom, have well-known careers in their country's TV / Cinema performance areas. /// Cinematography is also praiseworthy.   - AND NOT SO NOTABLE: An apparent storyline gap of near 15 years presents a potential problem regarding the manner in which the lovemaking scene described above was set up. To me, the brothers' actions appear as if they are beginning their sexual activity for the very first time (tho I admit the possibility it's a \\"ritual\\" they enjoy when initiating sex). Certainly, with the closeness shown between these 2 young lads (and where it leads), it is hard to conceive that their mid- and late teen years together were not sexually active.  - FINALLY: I'll conclude here and allow you to find for yourself what the effects of a possible, long distance separation will be upon our lead characters....and what you might see their fate to be at film's conclusion.  WAIT....WAIT!  This needs to be added:  The lovemaking scenes of these brothers....even shots of just their \\"Closeness\\"....rank with the best ever captured on film.  Even approaching the level achieved in \\"[[ASIN:B004KA1DGG Undertow]]\\".....which I consider near ultimate.  PS--I've \\"snuck\\" back in here to let you know about another wonderful, little film of recent vintage.....\\"[[ASIN:B005GM38NI The One]]\\".  Yes, I've also done of review of it....which you should probably read BEFORE you watch the movie.
B000K4X2UQ|5.0|The cd was at a very reasonable price, much better than most of them for this specific product. The condition of the cd was flawless and had new packaging and original inserts in it that all looked brand new.

0316069353|4.0|This was another great Michael Connelly story.  Mickey Haller was wonderful, especially in the court room scenes and his staff, family and assorted bad guys added depth to the story.  The client, Lisa Trammel, was highly unlikeable but she still deserved to be defended.  Very enjoyable and fast-paced.      I would like to suggest to Amazon that you separate the reviews where people are complaining about the price of Kindle books from the reviews about the actual story content of the book.  The irate Kindle users skew the reviews and don't give a true picture of the popularity of the book unless you wade through all of the negative comments.  You could lump them in their own category and send them to the publisher!
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book is 5-star all the way!  Inspiring -- comforting, calming and inspiring. Pressfield talks about and deals with the dragon we all face in a way that recognizes the struggle -- constructively.  This is \\"can do\\" that makes \\"do the work\\" more than possible. \\"Do the work\\" is really nothing less than \\"must do.\\" And Pressfield lays out a workable approach.  I love this book.    Thank you to Steve Pressfield.  Thank you to The Domino Project and Amazon.    I'm not given to writing reviews but find it too sad that any confusion over a delivery system would carry over to a rating of the actual book.  That just makes no sense.    And I do hope all of you -- author, publisher and Amazon -- hear the 5-stars louder than you do the 1-stars.  I look forward to what comes next.  The Domino Project and Do the Work -- very good stuff.  Thank you.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I've read the first couple books and I will admit that I prefer the show. You get more in depth with the show. You also get to see characters that only appear as side characters in the books become more flushed out in the show. Very entertaining. I love it. 5 stars. *****
B0049P1VHS|5.0|When I first watched this show I was hesitant, I thought they would destroy the source material and it wouldn't transfer well to the screen. I'm glad to say I was wrong. This is an amazing show that has taken liberties from the source and made it stand out from the comic. When I started episode one on this DVD I watched all six episodes in one sitting. They draw you in and make you want more.<br />Add to this the wonderful special features and you have yourself a great television show release on DVD. I'm glad I purchased this, and at such a low price too! (Currently selling for $9.99 as of this review).<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the comic and the zombie genre.
B00127RAJY|4.0|If you're out of shape you may want to try something a bit slower. If you're in relatively good shape this will work you fast to losing some weight. I have been doing P90x for 2 months now and added the 30 day shred from Jillian. I have totally removed my P90x Cardio day with 40 minutes of Jillian's 30 day shred (it's much more intense and I get a better workout in 40 minutes than I do with the 44mins of P90x cardio) and I can tell even more of a difference in my body shaping. Jillian gives you a good cardio workout and some nice toning exercises.     Remember exercise alone doesn't get your body in the shape you want it to. You need to follow a good diet. Cut out the junk food, and processed foods, and drink plenty of water, exercise, and you'll see excellent results. Far too often, people are looking for that quick fix, lose weight fast option. It doesn't exist, hard work and a good diet will get you there, and this video will help you.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Now understand that for me, if it's not Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, then it's not Sherlock Holmes, so I saw this movie in the theater before I purchased it. And...I was surprised. Certainly a new take on Sherlock's physicality...not what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would write. And the new Dr. Watson is a little young, but not bad. I enjoyed the movie...very entertaining...but I think if they would have shot the movie in black and white it would have been better. I would probably watch another \\"episode\\" if they make one...but alas...it still can't touch the old series.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Its suspenseful and takes you on many twists and turns. If your looking for a movie that messes with your mind and is entertaining then watch this. Everything is all very well planned. Its mind-boggling and crazy and sentimental and fun.

The acting especially is incredible... with Sean P Flannery delivering hands down, his best work to date...  a dream role for any actor really.... but its good that he didnt overplay it.... gave it just the right amount of intensity and especially, subtlety to make it authentic and not pretentious. Jeff Goldblum is pretty much perfect in anything he does to me..  and even more when he's playing middle aged intellectuals... pretty much his forte.. lol  Lance Herickssen is amazing in it as well... and there is a scene involving Powder, him and his wife that will remind you what an underated and underused actor the guy is...  guy is another one of those... wipes the floor w most of the hollywood elite kinda actors that truly doesnt get the work that he deserves... what a shame. The message in this film is incredible and really makes you understand how flawed and ignorant society is... especially around things which we dont understand. Some people treat others very bad and the majority of the time, its based on fear or just plain ignorance, which is the case in this film....  but there is always room for growth and this movie reminds u of that....  often more than not, we get caught up in our own little existence and dont really give others the respect and attention that they deserve, not knowing that those others could lead to become very important people in our lives if we give them more entry into our existence... there's a lot to learn from the most unexpected sources. Watch this movie asap... it was one of the best films of the year and it is one that holds a special place in my dvd sanctuary :)
B002ZG99TA|4.0|I wanted to watch this when it first came out on the big screen but was too busy...but after receiving a gift card for my birthday, I picked it up and now the whole family has watched it! It's an entertaining flick! I'm from southern Ohio and am familiar with western PA, although I think the film was actually shot somewhere in east central Ohio...and since it's based on actual events, I'm glad I don't live in Stanton, PA! All in all, this movie is a good buy...fun for the whole family...pop the corn and pour yourself a coke...this is a good thriller!
031603438X|5.0|Keefer's apparently not so drug addled memories of how he and the Stones came to be.  He writes a lot about being a musician, citing many of the Great Ones who he learned from and how he almost accidently became Bigger than God while simply trying to bring the Blues to England.  The ups, downs and flat spots of the Stones carreer and his take on the relationships with Mick, Gram Parsons, Brian Jones and the rest.  Plus his thoughts on Girls, Groupies, Guns and Drugs.  Seems remarkably candid and balanced and while admitedly his spin on things, seems quite unvarnished.  Portrait of a Happy Family Man who happens to be the Architypical Rock n Roll Guitar Player of the 60s, 70s and beyond.  Nice pics, too.
0385341679|5.0|The shadow series is amazing.  The final book \\"Shadowfever\\" was everything that I hoped it would be.  The imagination and creativity of the final closing was awesome.  I hope that Ms. Moning continues on with perhaps a book on the Druid, Christian.  Love her works - she is an amazing and creative writer.
B0001I55SS|5.0|A great movie from my childhood! Still like it today! The transfer is a little disappointing, I wish this was released in HD.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|I love Gilmore girls...it is such a great show! And you can't beat the price on Amazon. I checked around at other movie retailers (online and brick and mortar stores) and Amazon had unbeatable prices on series like Gilmore girls.    I suggest this show to anyone!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am in love with Adele.  She has such a great voice.  For being only 21 she has a voice and sound like someone who has been doing this for along time.  I am glad she is no Britney Spears.
B001FAFO3W|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I was completely disappointed when I put it in my dvd player and it would not play.  The dvd plays on my compuer but not on my tv.  I will try to see if it plays on another dvd player.    The price was really good and the delivery was fast, no complaints about that.  I just wish I could view it.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Steven Pressfield has done it again. In 2002 he wrote The War of Art as a guide for battling Resistance. In Do The Work, he takes you through the steps needed to not only battle Resistance, but to conquer it and achieve your dreams.<br /><br />In Star Wars terms, Pressfield is a Jedi Master and you are Luke Skywalker. There are intelligent forces in the Universe. We remain unconscious of them at our own peril. We all came into this life to create great art - whether through writing, through business or human interaction. Resistance is an insidious force that is hell bent on stopping you from creating your finest art and becoming the best version of you.<br /><br />The good news is that Resistance can be defeated. Pressfield shows you how. He even takes you through a step-by-step process that you can apply to whatever creative endeavor you were born to manifest. And more good news: Pressfield leads you to the opposite of Resistance, which is Assistance. As Joseph Campbell described in The Hero With A Thousand Faces, doors will open for you and magical helpers will appear if you will only choose to take the heroic path and Do The Work you are meant to do.<br /><br />Read this book. Read it again. Highlight the hell out of it. Then pass it along to other creators who need the wisdom, guidance and kick-in-the-butt that Pressfield provides.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|The Tourist.<br /><br />At least it knows what it is in the cinematic world - coming through to take a tour, and then leaving us well alone to be forgotten.<br /><br />Where to begin. Jolie and Depp are two great actors. Two of the greatest of our time, some would say. They've made incredible films that have touched us, entertained us, and made us cry.<br /><br />This, without a doubt, isn't one of them.<br /><br />The Tourist has an utter lack of pacing. Whomever is responsible for the draft of this script needs a serious lesson in rising tension. The plotline holds too many secrets for too long - it's almost the one hour mark (in a 90 minute movie) before anything truly begins to happen. The references as to whats truly happening are so bland and obscure, I had absolutely no care for what happened to the characters. Once Jolie's character was truly revealed, I couldn't help but roll my eyes. When Depp's was revealed, I could have seen it coming from a mile away - although, that's only because I'm used to these films - the actual plot becomes rather broken with this revelation, and makes the entire film nonsensical.<br /><br />This movie utterly fails to get the viewer to have any emotional investment in either the characters, the plot, or even the concept. Highlights for me were some pretty good scenes of Venice - but if I'm looking at the scenery instead of Jolie, you know we have a problem.<br /><br />This was also marketed (at least in the trailers that led me to watch this film) as an action / mystery flick. Spys, suave scenes and high society. Plain and simple, this is a lighthearted romantic.. comedy? Drama? Whatever you choose to call it, it was poorly done.<br /><br />Lastly, I can't believe this is hailed (even by some, the true film critics hated it as well) as 'significant.' I appreciate art films, rom-coms, action, horror - you name it. I'm completely unbiased in what I like - I'll give respect to any genre, if it's done well. This simply isn't a good movie. I can't be honest enough about it.<br /><br />Save your time, save your money. There are better Jolie & Depp films out there.<br /><br />1/5.ur time, save your money. There are better Jolie & Depp films out there.     1/5.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|By Jim Clark, Publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br />There is no denying that Gregg Allman has not aged well. I figure he would chuckle at that. For a good while his life was ruled by cocaine, heroin and alcohol. He has been sober since the mid-1990s. He had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C in late 2007 and has been battling the disease ever since. He got a liver transplant last year.<br />He's also been unlucky in love. Greg says he's been married six or seven times -- some of the engagements are a little fuzzy. He has several children and grandchildren, but is unsure of that number too.<br />I said all of that to introduce his newest solo-project Low Country Blues. I figure he's had the blues a time or two, and earned the right to sing them.<br />His manager got Gregg a meeting in Memphis with T-Bone Burnett, a seasoned bluesman himself.<br />\\"He told me some guy gave him a hard drive, it has 10,000 obscure blues songs,\\" Gregg said. \\"He says, `I'm goinna pick out twenty of `em and send `em to ya and you tell me what you think. They're old, like Billie Holliday old, and when you listen to `em, I want you to think about us gettin' in there and about bringin' `em up to today.'\\"<br />Since Gregg hadn't ventured into a studio since the death of his longtime producer Tom Dowd, he was starting to get the itch to do something. Blues had been a first love, which always shined through on early Allman Brothers stuff so he listened.<br />\\"If it works right, it all turns real magic,\\" Gregg said. \\"And that's what happened this time, more so I think than anything I've ever recorded. We got 15 masters in 11 days; let me tell ya, they just went pop! pop! pop!\\" The old grey mare is back and better than ever.
0399143793|5.0|Great service from this seller. Product arrived only a few days after my order and the condition of the book was what it said it would be and then some. I would buy from this seller again without hesitating.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|I did not like the movie at all. It felt like someone very inexperienced made the movie.The storyline was weak and seem to stretch on forever. Maybe it was because the movie was only a part one... I don't know. If you are looking for entertainment, I would skip it.
B002ZG9800|5.0|Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor sucking face.     I never thought I'd see the day. Or, write a positive review about such an experience - but apparently, stranger things have happened. Such as finding out this incredible tale is, indeed, a true story.     First off, I had no idea this was a gay rom-com / drama-ish / comedy when I picked it up. Didn't really look - just saw Carrey and McGregor on the front, and went for it. Fortunately, it worked out to be for the better. Had I known the plot without witnessing it first-hand, I probably wouldn't have bothered checking it out.    Carrey is just plain hilarious. You can tell he's matured, but he needed to be a little older and a little more grounded for this role. He's still got his patented insanity, but in this case - he plays it off as cunning, coniving and downright manipulative. Almost scary at times, but the more light-hearted moments really get to you.     I suppose if you wanted to characterize it as one, this could be a straight up romance. I wouldn't go that far, but I'm sure others would. To me, it was a fantastic tale of a con-man on the lam, fighting to break out of jail again and again to get to whom he loves.    At the end of the day, don't let the homophobic reviews scare you - it's not all that in your face, and it's all in good fun.     Easily, 5/5.
B004L49JYO|3.0|Tokyo Gore Police is a fun movie - it's one of the recent \\"over the top, super-gore\\" films coming out of Japan (Machine Girl, Mutant Girls Squad, Robo-Geisha, Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl, Meatball Machine, Samurai Princess, Hard Revenge Milly), and I think the names should be enough to tell you that these aren't going to be high-class art films. These movies are generally made on a lower budget, with a focus on trying to \\"top\\" the other movies in terms of craziness, and Tokyo Gore Police does a good job at that. If you've seen Kill Bill, these movies are over the top in a similar way as the Crazy 88's fight sequence in the first movie - blood splattering and parts flying everywhere. If you liked that, these movies are for you. If you didn't, just move on now.<br /><br />For more information on this movie, I would suggest reading some of the reviews from the DVD page: [[ASIN:B001I82RVS Tokyo Gore Police]]. It's a love-it-or-hate-it type of movie.<br /><br />I loved it - even bought 3 different versions of it, and that's part of where my problem is.<br /><br />Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock have been releasing multiple versions of these films, each with numerous problems (usually release a movie-only version, following it up a couple months later with a Movie+Extras version (in the case of Tokyo Gore Police, a 2nd disc of short films), and then either a 3rd release (Movie+Extras+More Extras.. or a Blu-Ray)). Machine Girl is getting a total of 4 releases, this Blu-Ray is Tokyo Gore Police's 3rd release and it seems like a step back.<br /><br />The most obvious problem is that this is listed as a 2-disc set on the back of the case, featuring the extras: TOKYO GORE POLICE SHORT FILM COLLECTION, ORIGINAL TRAILER, OPENING DIGEST. Opening the case, you'll immediately notice it's a 1-disc set, and the only extras are the theatrical trailer and some other Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock trailers.<br />It's also unexplainable - some companies will get lazy and just copy the DVD coverart for the Blu-Ray, leaving some discrepencies. Media Blasters actually re-did the artwork for the entire Blu-Ray case (front and back), and created a new menu system for the Blu-Ray, so it's not like it was a quick re-packaging.<br /><br />If you want the Tokyo Gore Police Short Film Collection, you need to buy the [[ASIN:B00393SG1K Tokyo Gore Police 1.5 (2pc) (Dub Sub)]] on DVD (a repackaging of the original DVD + a 2nd disc with the short films). The short films themselves aren't that special (I purchased both versions of the DVD and was disappointed by the short films), so it's not a huge loss, but they do make a good FREE extra, especially when they're advertised on the case.<br /><br />Video quality on the Blu-Ray is also questionable. I did a comparison with the DVD and the Blu-Ray appears to have some sort of digital-smoothing applied (and sharpening over that). Lots of faces lack detail and show edge enhancement throughout the film. This is a low-budget film, so I won't completely fault Media Blasters, but there does appear to be some tweaking done as the DVD did not display these problems as noticeably. Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock has had a pretty spotty record with their blu-ray releases, so it's no surprise. At other times, though, it does seem good.<br /><br />I can't comment on the audio as I don't have a DTS-HD compatible system, but the disc does contain English DTS-HD 2.0 / 5.1 and Japanese DTS-HD 2.0 / 5.1 according to the box (it's only listed as 2.0 or 5.1 on the menu, so I can't confirm it's DTS-HD).<br /><br />I like the movie - I got the Blu-Ray cheap (cheaper than I paid for the DVD, even) so I don't regret it. I wouldn't recommend upgrading the DVD to it, but for those who are looking to buy it (without owning any previous editions), ask yourself if the Short Film Collection is important to you. If not, get the blu-ray. If it is, get the [[ASIN:B00393SG1K Tokyo Gore Police 1.5 (2pc) (Dub Sub)]] DVD.some discrepencies.

B002JH3TW8|5.0|This adapter is perfect for those of us who still have peripherals with the older Firewire 400 ports and the newer Apples with Firewire 800 ports. It connects nicely and easily between our external hard drives of varying brands and capacities and our various MacBooks and MacBookPros. Multiple times, lots of tossing around in bags between attachments and still going strong. I like it because it's long enough not to cause a nuisance at the computer end and short enough not to be irritating at the cord end. Perfect.
B003D0ZNL0|5.0|This is a STUNNING collection.  If you are looking at this and thinking about making a purchase, think no more.  I have had limited exposure to Rudolf Kempe's recordings (never saw him live), but having heard most of the disks in this set now, all I can say is, Wow!  This box is a bargain and a half, and virtually all of these recordings are top-shelf, some being even better.<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved the Dvorak 9th--the best I've heard!  The Brahms 4th is outstanding, the Brahms 3rd very good.  The Beethoven 5 & 6 are excellent, the Wagner FANTASTIC, and the Strauss walzes/polkas are second only to Karajan's fantastic New Year's Day concert disc.<br /><br />I can only imagine what kind of career Kempe would have had had he not been living in East Germany.  There's no question he was regarded by the great orchestras of Central Europe (Dresden, Berlin, Vienna) as one of the great conductors of his time, but he seems to have had little exposure in the States, and in the U.K. he was not performing with their best orchestras.  It is what it is, but what Kempe has left behind, as evidenced by this set, is an example of great art being made by a great conductor.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|The Pianist is based on a true story about the survival of a Jewish classical pianist trying to survive the Nazi holocaust during WWII.  It is a heartwrenching tale of a man who lost his family and his love of music, but managed to survive with the help of others.    I loaned my DVD to my children, who viewed it with their friends, who borrowed it, and now I'm not sure where it is.  The kids said they would track it down, but I don't think it is at the top of their priority list.    As always, the vendor was prompt in his delivery of the disc; and, even though it was used, it arrived in the quality of a new movie.

B000RJO578|5.0|I bought this DVD for somewhere around $7 dollars total, this is with shipping and all. What can I say? Low price for a great movie. Came in a timely manner, a little less than a week. DVD plays great, no scratches, and the box and cover art are in perfect condition.
0316056863|5.0|I received this book yesterday in the mail and am almost finished.  I laughed out loud literally at least 15 to 20 times.  My husband looked at me like I was a lunatic but this book is great!  Must read!!!
B000RIHBIE|5.0|When the album initially came out in 07, I can't even count the times I had listened to it. I had received it as a \\"burned\\" copy, so I never actually owned the real thing. Well now in 2011 my love for the sums hasn't deminished, and I thought I'd show my support. Got it used for about $6 total, after shipping. Came in about a week. Great condition record, art book perfect, the jewel case has cracks in it but hey, it was 6 bucks.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|I bought this for use with an FIIO E9.  The DAC is an improvement over the Intel \\"SRS Premium sound\\" of my Dell Studio laptop.  Depending on the quality of the DAC on your sound card, the improvement may or  may not be worth it.  It works well. No background hiss or noise. Worked easily with Linux with no compatibility issues or sound dropouts (unlike the Nuforce uDAC I tried).    Without the E9, it struggles to power my Beyerdynamic DT990s (250 Ohm).   It has enough power for use with my Grado SR220.    With the E9 it works fine with all headphones I tried.

030746363X|5.0|I've lost 33 pounds by eating eggs and beans for breakfast within an hour of waking up.  Meat, veggies, and beans for the rest of my meals.  I've been following the 4HB diet for about 4 months (Jan 4-April 20).  I just started kettlebells to start working on the building muscle part.  I highly recommend this book to everyone that wants to hack their body to make it work/look like they want.  This is the only system I've tried that's an easy no brainer to stay on.  It's easy to keep on the diet because when you crave something you just make a note of it and have it on Saturday (cheat day).      I'm down 2-3 pant sizes and my XXL shirts are starting to look silly.  There's a cool little community of #4HB folks on Twitter too.  This book has honestly changed my life for the better.  I have recommended this book to 3 personal friends and they've all lost over 20 pounds since they started just the diet portion not even working out.      1.  4HB Works.  2.  It's simple and easy to start.  3.  It's easy to stay on indefinitely.    Fantastic work by Tim Ferris and his team.    I highly recommend the Withings scale.

I really loved all the costumes and the dance routines were great. Stanley Tucci was also very good and worked well with Cher.  I recommend this movie to all people who love musicals great singing, dancing and acting by all.
031261246X|5.0|My fiancee and I flew to Los Ángeles from Philadelphia last week. A week or so before we departed she asked if there was a novel that I wanted to read on the flight that she could buy for me. My immediately response was \\"Zero Day\\".     Five days before we were to leave, the book arrived. I was told that I couldn't open it: \\"It's for the trip!\\" Every time I walked near the book in its Amazon shipping box I'd pick it up and think to myself \\"I want to start this!\\" I did open the box and flip through the pages but did not begin it.     I'm a computer consultant. I've been using system tools written by Mark Russinovich for years, long before he worked at Microsoft, so I was quite aware of his intelligence and computer expertise. Frankly, I was concerned about how he would \\"translate\\" geek-speak into a novel. I was worried that the book would be technically correct but totally unreadable...and not a good read.     My concern was unfounded. He has written an excellent novel which isn't overly geeky for the \\"normal\\" reader and it isn't so dumbed down for the techophobes as to be uninteresting for the computer savvy reader. One need not own a computer to appreciate the novel.     I subscribe to Mark's blog; I first read about \\"Zero Day\\" on the blog while reading about the Stuxnet malware. Mark must have some precognitive ability because \\"Zero Day\\" could easily be a novel about Stuxnet. Scary stuff that everyone should be concerned about.    I have only one complaint: I couldn't put the book down and therefore finished it long before our return flight to Philadelphia: I had to read a magazine and look out the window!    Mark, stop doing all that geeky computer stuff and write another book,    If \\"Zero Day\\" is not made into a thriller of a movie I'll be surprised...and disappointed.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|After seeing the previews for Game of Thrones on HBO in the weeks leading up to the premier episode on 4/17/2011, I said to myself, \\"Here we go again with another Ken Follett-esque [[ASIN:B003UD7J9E Pillars of the Earth]] kinda show.\\" Game of Thrones looked like your typical Medieval times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was disinterested...until a few days before the premier I happened to catch a making-of Game of Thrones production. So I set my DVR.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is right up my alley. Indeed it has the sword fights and debauchery that I mentioned a second ago, but I was under the impression that this was to be a depiction of some real world that existed a long long time ago. No...not at all the case. In the opening moments of the show we are introduced to a place that clearly has some \\"Otherly\\" world creatures in it. So after a little checking I see that the story is based on the fantasy book series by George R. R. Martin called A Song of Ice and Fire. The book series is highly rated here at Amazon with over 1000 reviews for the first installment called...you guessed it...Game of Thrones.<br /><br />The show is excellent. The HBO crew has created magic with Game of Thrones. It's a fantastic drama aimed towards an adult audience. It's must see TV for fans of the fantasy genre.

0307472841|1.0|After finishing this book I was actually sad that the the heroine was not knocked off by her rather improbable nemesis.  It seems ironic that this fellow can pursue the distant relatives of a man who lived 100 years before. In the meantime Mao is killing hundreds of millions of Chinese and no one blinks an eye.  One wonders how long the Sweedish judge would last in the Socialist paradise of China?  She seems to blame all of China and the world's evils on capitalism.      Finally can any one explain who actually killed those elderly Sweedes?   I thought it was the villain's assasin but later in the book the man in the photo was identified as Ja Ru(spelling) himself and not his henchman.   Very confusing.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|The music is outstanding!  The story of the difficulties overcome by both commoner and royalty is inspiring and best of all based on a true story.  There is some foul language, but in the context most will not find it offensive.  The R rating is probably overkill as there are only a few bursts of bad language to merit even a PG-13, and little else.  The Australian acting is especially enjoyable and true to the story's history.
0525951113|3.0|I really enjoyed reading Daniel Suarez's debut novel Daemon. As others have noted, it has that Michael Crichton vibe and attention to detail. Here's the plot in a nutshell. Brilliant MMORPG (Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Game) programer and company owner Matthew Sobol dies from a long battle with brain cancer. This event sets off a computer daemon (pre-programed virtual intelligence) which manipulates computer controlled devices in the real world to kill programers from Sobols company that might have been able to stop it. The Daemon then goes on to effect things in the real world when triggered by specific stories in the news. Apparently Sobol thought that society needed fixing. Before his death, he set in motion all of the key elements to make his vision happen.<br /><br />Sound a bit complicated? Indeed it is. All of the pre-planning for every contingency to make something on this scale work is mind boggling. The time, resources and money to set all of this in place makes it's likelihood improbable at best. Looking back at the story after the fact, it just seems like too much suspension of disbelief. I felt this book was intended and presented as a techno-thriller when perhaps it was really more sci-fi. Suarez includes such a large cast of characters that I was left wondering who was who at times, and I found this a bit distracting. It also left a number of key characters undeveloped. He could probably had done more with a leaner cast, but I get that he was trying to impress a sense of scale upon the reader. I was also able to predict a major plot point early on that was supposed to be a big reveal at the end, so I was a bit underwhelmed when it finally happened.<br /><br />All that didn't really matter when I was reading though. Suarez keeps the pace fast and knows his cyber-stuff. You'll learn alot about AI technology from its pages. The players range from the media, to the local cops, to the FBI, to shadowy government organizations, to corrupt big businesses. Locals center initially in California but then cover the USA and cross-cross the globe. And that is just in the physical world -- there's a lot going on in the virtual one as well. Suarez deftly ties it all together and makes fantastical technological concepts seem plausible. I would certainly recommend this book to fans of Michael Crichton and even William Gibson. Those interested in AI, cyberpunk, computer technology, police dramas and online gaming would also likely find it engrossing. It kept me turning the pages right up to end, but don't be surprised if it doesn't quite seem as impressive in retrospect.<br /><br />3.5 stars<br /><br />~ Kortcals center initially in California but then cover the USA and cross-cross the globe.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Fun mystery game. Kind of like Myst. Challenging at times too. It's not replayable, but it's only a dollar. Plus someone else could start over on your phone.
1416972250|5.0|So, where do I start on this summary?  Well, if you are getting to this book, you've probably already read the first two books and so hooked you don't care what I'm going to say.  But I'm going to give it a quick go for you anyway.  And if you haven't read the first two books, there WILL BE SPOILERS FOR FIRST TWO BOOKS here.    With the end of City of Ashes, we now have a clue from an old friend of Clary's mothers of what we need to do to wake Clary's mom from her self induced coma.  Clary is still struggling with Jace being her brother, and wanting more from the relationship and not acting on it.  Now we find the Lightwoods, Jace, and Clary are traveling to the home country of the Shadowhunters and the capital city.  But as excited as Clary it to go and see the home city, Jace is just as determined to not have Clary go.  And Clary nor the others know why.  Jace is being very secretive about it again.  Will Clary get there?  Of course she will, but what will happen when she arrives?  And how will she get there?    Well, I have to say I had to rush out to get this book as I couldn't wait to read it.  I HAD to know what would happen, mostly with Clary and Jace.  And the ride Cassandra takes you on with each book is just amazing.  This is another wonderfully written book in which I didn't get much sleep until I was done with it.  I just couldn't put it down.  And not just because I wanted answers.  We start right where City of Ashes leaves off and jump head first into the action.  These characters never get a rest from the wicked in this book and I loved it!    We meet new characters and all the old.  And we lose a character or two ;) as we go through this one too.  I loved the way the characters stay true to who they are from the beginning, yet some have grown so greatly from the beginning.  And until the end of this book, I really didn't realize how much these characters had grown.      I am so hooked on this series, I will follow it until Cassandra doesn't write ofit anymore.  She has really made a true believer and a great fan of her work here.    Thank you Cassandra!
0312427999|5.0|This book is an unsettling read to say the least, but I believe it should be required reading for all Americans---maybe for all human beings.  I thought I was relatively well informed about the current political situation but I was so very wrong.  I didn't know the depth of the craziness we are living through, nor did I know how it started or what people (who we would consider sane and normal in everyday life) are capable of doing to other people in the name of power, control and profit.      As I'm reading this book I'm hearing about how in Michigan and Wisconsin people are losing their rights---even having the people they elected to represent them forced out of office---left with little recourse and no one to defend them or uphold rights we all thought we had simply because we are Americans.  And the politicians doing this are from a party that claims to love God, Country, and the Constitution.  Apparently if that 'love' gets in the way of a plan to get the money, control, and forced compliance of the citizenry the lofty ideals and rhetoric go right out the window.    This country was founded on ideals of freedom for all, of government by the people and for the people. Our Founding Fathers must be turning over in their graves wondering why they paid such a heavy price for what is so easily undone by unscrupulous people in power. We've elected vultures who are taking it all away because they can and because they don't believe we have the will to stop them.  I hope they're wrong.    The Shock Doctrine plainly shows what happens when people allow this to happen in their country, and also how it creeps up on you when you aren't looking so you are totally unprepared for the onslaught and unable to collect yourselves to fight while there's still time.  I hope that isn't true for us.    Who would have thought this could happen in the USA?  Certainly not me.    I'm still in the process of reading this book and the parts I've read so far don't have much to do with the United States (although the architects of the horrendous events are Americans, to our shame), but there is much to learn from this book.  And as I look around the political landscape in the US with new eyes I'm scared.  Hopeful, but scared.
0307279189|5.0|Great story and great research on a very unknown people.  This book has made me reevaluate how I run and fueled my passion for running even more.  I am in the Army and I am not authorized to wear the Vibram Five fingers because they are \\"faddish.\\"  I think if the barefoot catches on, sneakers will prove to be the fad in the history of running.  I can't wait to get home and try out running on grass.  Bottomline, read this book.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Well done -love this game! Would love to see more like it! For those having a force close problem, try restarting your phone after installation.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|The book was good, but there was great expectations for this final book in the series. I found it hard to get into it based on the pacing and in retrospect, perhaps the series should have been a couple less books to make it more powerful. Still a wonderful series.
B00127RAJY|1.0|My main issue with this DVD is the speed at which it moves.  I actually liked that aspect a lot, until I got to the lunges.  Michaels moves through the workout so quickly (which otherwise is a good thing) that it is very, very hard to ensure you're in proper lunge form the entire time, for every lunge.  Even when doing these lunges in front of a mirror, which is what I used to keep myself from overextending, it's quite hard to do them perfectly when you're absolutely flying through the workout.  I blew out my knee.  It hurts.  @*&%. I REALLY wish Gillian would slow the lunges part of the workout down just a little.  I'm sure plenty of gym rats (just kidding ;) will criticize me for not having my lunge form down perfectly, but like I said - it's REALLY freakin' difficult to do when you're moving at this speed.  Now I can't practice lunges at all, because my knee is all @$#%ed up.  Yay.
B003PIUC02|5.0|My son informed me about this program.  Purchased the DVD and was not disappointed.  Program and acting was excellent.  Hope the original Spartacus actor recovers from his bout with cancer so the series can continue.
B003ZSH606|5.0|This album's all good, swinging from groovy rock to lush rhythm 'n' blues, and back again.  \\"White knuckle ride\\" put a swivel in my hips, that I thought was long gone.  \\"Smoke and mirrors\\" is jazzy.  The next song goes funky, \\"all good in the hood.\\"  All the tracks are super solid Jamiroquai.  Tracks 8 to 10 are the  smokey phase of the album, going from sexy, to wonderful (\\"two completely different things\\"), to reggae with \\"goodbye to my dancer.\\"  Track 9 is my favorite.  But it's all good even great, well worth the \\"rock dust light star\\" trip.
1936719010|5.0|What a great book!<br /><br />How many people go through life saying (or thinking) \\"I coulda done that..\\" as they manufacture excuse after excuse for races not run...articles not written...careers not pursued...or dreams unfulfilled. The road to ennui is filled with these folks; isn't there a better way to live?<br /><br />Yes there is - and \\"Do The Work\\" is the roadmap to it.<br /><br />It's really simple, best-selling author Steve Pressfield explains, \\"a child has no trouble believing the unbelieveable, nor does the genius or madman...it's only you nd I, with our big brains and tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.\\" Listen to your dream, he writes, and work hard to beat \\"resistance\\" and \\"rational thought.,\\" that innver voice that calmly explains why you can't write an article or run a personal best on a windy day.<br /><br />Get out there before you're prepared, Pressfield advises \\"we show huevos. Or blood heats up. Courage begets more courage. The gods, witnessing our boldness, look on in approval\\"<br /><br />He's correct - sometimes you've just got to look the world in the eye, and say \\"F/U - catch me.\\" Thanks for writing this; now I've got the moto to BELIEVE that the rest of the world is wrong and I can achieve my dream - or my dream until I reach for the next big one...
B004PGO25O|5.0|Short, punchy, and inspirational.  Pressfield's book about the creative process provides an excellent overview of the barriers to producing creative work and a guide to overcoming them.  Learn all about Resistance and how to resist it!<br /><br />This is the perfect length and format for an e-book.  It is also helpful and well-written.
B004O54SO6|3.0|Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck    John Steinbeck was born in California and studied literature and writing. He worked as a laborer and journalist, and wrote novels and short stories. He is best known for \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". He won a Nobel Prize in 1962 and died in 1968. This 1937 novella, like his other books in the 1930s, dealt with the lives of workers in agriculture. It is the story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two workers who travel to farms as seasonal workers. The first of these unnumbered chapters describe their characters. George is small, thin, and quick. Lennie is big and dumb and controlled by George to keep him out of trouble. The next chapter tells about the ranch that hires them, and the conditions there. One hired hand just quit. An old man talks about the owner's son Curley and his wife. The other workers are described.    Slim talks to George about Lennie, a powerful worker. Hardly any of the migrant workers travel together. The others speak about conditions. Should Candy shoot his dog because its old and weak? Carlsson offers to do it. [A worker could own a pistol then.] The conversations tell about their lives. George dreams of owning his own ranch and working for himself. Candy offers to buy in to become their partner; he doesn't want to end up in the poor house. Curley attacks Lennie until Lennie ends the fight. Was there an accident? Saturday night most of the men go into town. Lennie talks to Crooks, the stable hand. Then to Candy. Curley's wife wanders in, and threatens them. The fifth chapter tells of Lennie's problem: he loves small animals to death. Curley's wife visits to talk. She too has dreams of a better life. Lennie begins to stroke her hair, she objects, and Lennie puts his other hand over her face. Did Lennie do a bad thing again? Candy find her on the ground. They will notify the police and hunt for Lennie.    The last chapter has the ending. Lennie dreams of Aunt Clara and a giant rabbit. Both blame him. George finds him, and they talk of their hoped-for future. There is a pistol shot. Slim says George had to do it; and they walk away for a drink. [No mention of what happened once the police investigated. I suspect this death would be covered up to avoid publicity. Just another crazy tramp?] This short story provides the background of migrant workers. They can only own what they can carry on their back. They travel from farm to farm to help with the harvest. Was Steinbeck advocating death for the old, the feeble-minded, and social misfits? Michael Crichton's \\"State of Fear\\" explains this in \\"Appendix I\\". The 1939 movie was often shown on TV in the 1950s and 1960s. Compare it to the original novel.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|The age old question of what happens when we die is explored in director Clint Eastwood's elegant but slow HEREAFTER.<br />Three separate stories inevitably converge to a union of its three chief protagonists which seemed a little contrived to me, but effective nonetheless.<br />An Oscar-nominated tsunami opens the film nicely and segues into the more conventional storyline.  Eastwood's direction is understated and unobtrusive, allowing the strong performances to drive the film.  Matt Damon is excellent and generous, not succumbing to his star power nor trying to dominate the movie.  Cecile de France brings a haunting strength and eloquence to her role and the McLaren twins are heartbreakingly convincing.<br />I wasn't totally impressed because it seemed dull at times and almost too restrained as if Clint was trying to overly arthouse his direction.  I also didn't care for Bryce Howards or Jay Mohr's performances.<br />Overall, the movie offers poignant reactions to death and life without offering definitive answers.  The talent is obvious--it just didn't overwhelm me.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|My understanding, when I bought my kindle was that books published more than 50 years ago would be free or a nominal fee....I am finding this to be far from true....why is this book so expensive in the kindle edition?  I just will not pay these prices for Kindle books.
1936719010|4.0|I certainly enjoyed the book and while I find it very much a repeat of [[ASIN:0446691437 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]] (which was truly an astonishing book) there is still reason to get it, especially now that it's still free :)     Was very happy to preorder it and get it on my Kindle although I think many of the people who bought Poke the Box also got this as a bonus.     The messages within are good although nothing revolutionary. Some powerful stuff and ideas but nowhere near as in depth as the book it's summarizing.     I say get it and read it, there's no reason why you shouldn't.
B00004ZBVG|3.0|I see that there are many positive reviews of this movie.  However, I am a Vietnam vet, serving from 1965 to 1971.  All I could focus on were the glaring inaccuracies throughout the entire movie.  It just didn't happen that way, and that ruined it for me.  They should have had a Vietnam combat veteran advise the producers, and have taken the advice.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Of the 30+ blu-rays I have, this is definitely one of the best looking. If you own a blu-ray player and love intense action, Buy this movie!!!
0439023491|5.0|I wasn't expecting to love The Hunger Games as much as I did...and I was even more surprised when I loved Catching Fire even MORE than that.<br /><br />Collins just keeps outdoing herself.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I've been waiting to see this movie and it was well worth the wait. I knew about the history of the procession of the king to the throne but never in detail, I, like most other people was only aware of the controversy about Wallace Simpson and the Duke and his walking away from being king after the death of his father. I can better understand the reason the Queen Mother did not want this story told until she had passed away and I applaud all involved that had known and worked on this story and yet maintained the secrecy  out of respect. It is a wonderful film and like other reviews before me and I am sure reviews yet to come, it is refreshing not to have your intellect insulted by an endless parade of explosives, race cars, special effects and plot designed only to carry and justify insipid dialog and pointless sex. I miss these kinds of movies, movies and I wish people would make more of them, what a treat to watch.
0316056863|5.0|I really liked the natural voice in this book.  Tina laughs at herself as much as she does anyone else.  I loved the inside glimpse of both SNL and 30 Rock.  All around good read!
B004H73W48|5.0|I have read the writings of many brilliant authors and have envied none of them their ability until now. The style of Elizabeth Gilbert (EAT, PRAY, LOVE and COMMITTED) I'd love to copy. She expresses deep and spiritual thoughts simply; defines new and foreign words clearly; paints beautiful word pictures of her travels; shares her good and not-so-good inner feelings,is often self-deprecating. Her research is thorough - digs deep. And she is SO funny.
0061122416|5.0|The book was in way better condition than I thought it would be, it's paperback that's kind of thick and the quality is much nicer than normal paperback. I'm really happy with it and I got it in a very short amount of time!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|When the kindle price becomes more realistic I will read what I am sure is a great book. The practice of popular authors charging kindle users basically the same as the printed version is obscene. I will not stand for it and will bypass any publishers who engage is this tactic.
B003UESJH4|2.0|When I went to see this movie, I had heard nothing but rave reviews from from critics and people alike. Because of what everyone had talked it up to be, I was pretty excited to see it, I assumed that the title had some other symbolic meaning and that it wasn't ACTUALLY about a king giving a speech. I was wrong. Here is the plot of the movie, I'll do it right here. A King with a stutter seeks voice lessons. After a little bit of training he learns to speak pretty well (he still stutters more than a little bit). At the end and climax of this film, he (surprise, surprise) gives a speech. It's not an incredible speech, it's pretty good but in reality, not that special of a speech. I am aghast at peoples' reaction to this movie. What do you possibly see in it? The acting I'll give you, was very good but that is all I'll give you, very good, not great. I've asked multiple people why they like this movie so much and most of the time they tell me all about how inspiring it was. Inspired you to do what exactly? I'll tell you all a secret, as a child, I had a bit of a stutter and it comes back every now and then but only briefly. Guess what? I got over it. Lots of people have stutters. It's not all that hard to act like you have a stutter. The movie was ok i guess. I was a little bored by it. but I honestly want to know, what is so great about this movie?
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|If there's a Rock Heaven then this is what we would find.  Dave and the boys just rockin' in our garage.  VH1 presented a kick ass documentary on the band leading up to the production of Wasting Light.  FF fans have to check it out and you'll find the video is great introduction to the new Album.<br /><br />Personally, 90% of the tracts are first class with Walk, Rope, and Bridge Burning my favs, but there a plenty of others that will make you reach for this album ahead of other FF records.<br /><br />They produced this piece of art in Dave's garage.  Just pinch me, I must be dreaming.  This is rock heaven!
0440241901|4.0|It isn't often that I read \\"chick lit,\\" not because I don't like it but because I tend to forget about it.  It isn't the type of book that I think to seek out when I'm in a library or bookstore.  So I'm always glad when I read something for a book club that I wouldn't have picked up on my own and rediscover why I enjoy something.<br /><br />Can You Keep A Secret? was just that kind of book for me.  It reminded me that sometimes I need to take a break and read something that is fun and light on the surface even when it does examine some deeper aspects of relationships.  I was hooked on Emma from the beginning of the story.  Her chatty voice drew me in and I listened along as if I were on a journey with a close girlfriend.  Sometimes I struggle with books that are supposed to be funny when the main character has everything go wrong because I don't see the humor in the suffering.  With Emma, I was totally mortified right along with her as Jack hinted at her secrets in various situations but I was able to find it funny as well.<br /><br />My heart dropped with Emma's when there was a twist that I didn't see coming and I wondered if miscommunications and secrets really would be the end of things for Jack and Emma.<br /><br />Can You Keep A Secret? was a fast read and a bit of an emotional roller coaster with more depth than seen at first glance.
B004SBX112|1.0|The new 'Pignic' level constantly crashes.  There is a 'loading' screen and then it crashes out of the application entirely.  All the previous versions of 'Seasons' worked great but the newest level is a disaster.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times with no resolution.  So now I have a crashing program AND have lost all my previous stars on the other seasons.  I am not happy!  Hopefully, Rovio or Amazon is working on a fix???
B000000OF6|1.0|I dont know if I got a defective copy, but there is distortion and breaking up of sound on this set.  listen to a download before you get it.
0316069353|5.0|Ingore all the 1 star reviews! They are from disgruntled Kindle users (I don't read Amazon Reviews to find out your Kindle issues, I read them to get an idea whether or not I will like the book). Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer, has taken on a murder case in which one of his clients is accused of murdering a bank exec over a foreclosure. Mr. Connelly continues to successfully develop Haller's character. This is pure courtroom drama. It is the court case that is the story. The writing, as always, is exceptional. The character development is superb and the plotting is excellent. The greatest compliment you can pay a book is - \\"I couldn't put it down\\" and I couldn't put it down! Enjoy! GREAT READ!!
B004TL0J5M|2.0|Let me keep it very short and simple and ask this.....did he write this himself? All the characters seem a little off:-(
0143117564|1.0|Wow. I guess it's not fair to review a book you couldn't finish, but I feel compelled to rant about how annoying and irritating Pynchon's style was.  I've never read anything from him before, and I don't question his talent, but unless you are an original hippie who lived through the heyday of the \\"free love\\" movement, then I doubt you could enjoy this book. I know I didn't.  I really tried to get into the characters and give this one a chance, but it ends up sounding like the ramblings of an intoxicated person and you are the sober one patiently waiting for a point to be made.  It never arrives. There is an interesting plot in this book but it gets strangled by Pynchon taking poetic license to try and recreate life in the 60's.  I get it. Everyone was stoned. You know how annoying it is listening to a stoned person ramble on about nothing?  That's what reading the first half of this book is like. I decided my life is too valuable to waste time reading something I don't enjoy, especially when so many good books are waiting in the wings.  Sorry Pynchon, but I just could not take it any longer. You got my $15 bucks, so you are ultimately the winner, but you're just not my style.  I really did try to like it. Peace and Love my brother......
B004I2K4DY|3.0|I was expecting this DVD with a lot of anxiety. but when I watch it, it left a lot  to be desired.  Mind me, the music/orchestra espectacular, but the choosing of some of the main \\"chracters\\" wasn't the best. My scale from 1-10 is as follows: Valjean? 8, Cossette? 9, Javert? 10+, the children? 10, the Inkeepers? 8, the Monk? 8+, and Marius? 0. This one was the mistake of the whole production. Can't  believe Producers chose this weak/non expressive person to represent such a magnificet character.  What a waste! In conclusion; I have this DVD just to have the collection complete, otherwise I wouldn't even consider buying it.  The big  problem here is the original version (Wilkinson) who was totally in a different league;the whole cast (face expressions, voices, demeanor). Lea Salonga (espectacular), and the rest of the production.  I'm very thankful to Amazon, for offering these products at such a reasonable price.  Always classy, giving the public the best to choose, prompt deliveries, well packaged.  I love Amazon!!!!!
B001C3KCSY|1.0|I purchased this album because a good friend had said I would like it. From what I heard playing in public places etc. I thought it sounded good. I felt the album started out strong, but as it went on I found the songs to be lacking anything special. There were no real melodies and nothing really creative about the instrumentation. The production was excellent though. Aside from the first and third song, I felt it was forgettable, generic, popular music. I tried to listen to it a few more times before giving it away. What's worse is I had bought two copies off Amazon and sent one to my cousin. I apologized profusely and told him to not open it and to send it back. Turns out he already heard the album and disliked as much as I did. My guess is if Sex on Fire wasn't on this album it wouldn't have done so well. So in short, this album is crap.
B00110K62U|5.0|Talk about excellence in it's prime, this is it! The best musical prodution I've seen in a long time. Let me tell you from the theme song to the end, this is truly  an incredible story that came alive thanks to the extraordinary talent of Cameron Mackintosh and other extremely wise gentlemen who created a masterpiece.  Their choosing of characters/singers/actors (all in one) made the book turned to musical  an experience of a lifetime. I want to personally thank you and the whole cast for a first class presentation. Now, Mr.Wilkinson, Quast. Lea Salonga and Mr/Mrs. Thénardier, Marius, Cossette, well the whole cast should all be highly commended for making each character as real as life! I simply loved this 10th Anniversary of  Les Miserables. and unfortunately when you compare the two of them (the 25th  version), the results are way below your espectations.  But what's above all expectations is AMAZON!! What a great company you are, offering the public the best  that's out there at the most incredible prices! People, once you try Amazon, you'll never go back to wherever you came from.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Yesterday I received my product, so far it´s amazing, it was the only one that was missing for my collection of Slipknot.    I recommend this title to all fans of Slipknot, the background of the entire album is great, it transports you to a place were damage is the main issue.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I have always been a big Daria fan and was excited when the series was released.  The collection is great.  It has the movie specials and the Daria day intros.  The only thing I would like to have seen come with it is a guide book or sheet with the titles of episodes on each disc.  Other than that it is wonderful, a classic for the 90's and all cliche high school drama.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I love this record.  I have never been a huge fan of Foo but I have liked the majority of their radio hits.  Based on the documentary Back and Forth (which is also great, by the way) I decided to give this one a try.  I love all the tracks and especially the first three.  My only problem with the record is White Limo.  The music is KILLER but the vocals I just do not care for, which sounds like someone screaming over a cell phone or something.  Even so, the music is enough to keep me listening to the song.  Great record and worth the money!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth at his best.  Richly deserved nominations and awards.  Helena Bonham-Carter was wonderful too.  She made me adore Queen Elizabeth.  I loved the portrayal of the closeness of Bertie and Elizabeth as well their relationship with their children.  Both heartbreaking, and inspiring!! I'll be seeing this one again and again.
0307593495|5.0|This is the 10th book in the Kurt Wallander series and the first that I have read.  My previous exposure to Wallander was the PBS series by the same name. In this, the last of the series, Wallander investigates the disappearance of his daughter's potential future in-laws, not as an official police investigation, but because of the personal connection.  His daughter, Linda, has a child, Klara, by Hans the son of the people who disappeared. They both vanished for no apparent reason.  The plot is secondary to Wallander's journey into himself. He is an aging man haunted by his dreams, his memories, his losses, his illnesses and his troubling memory lapses. He is still up to the challenge of solving the case. Henning Mankell is a gifted writer and little is lost in translating the book from Swedish to English. This book is recommended reading for people who appreciate finely crafted police mysteries.
B004SBX112|3.0|Where is the Easter update???.  Google's market has the update, I can understand if a takes an extra day or two to review the code for problems, but not this long
B003V5PPZG|3.0|I thought I would share my opinion as a non-Linkin Park fan, since most of the reviews on here seem to alternate between \\"I love Linkin Park and this album rules\\" and \\"I love Linkin Park and this album sucks\\".    I liked a few of their previous songs (Hands Held High, In The End, My December) but had never gotten an album before and didn't know much about the band other than what I heard on the radio.  Then I heard \\"Waiting For The End\\" from this album and I though, why not get the whole thing.    Well, I'm glad I did because there are a couple of really, really good songs...but overall, it just doesn't quite work for me.  I get that it's a \\"concept\\" album and I give them credit for not just throwing together 12 random tracks...but even as a concept album, it doesn't quite work for me.  However, there are some highlights:    \\"Waiting For The End\\" is just a wonderful song.  A great combination of energy & emotion, intensity & softness, hope & fear.    \\"When They Come For Me\\" is a catchy, energetic, angry, funny song that gets better with every listen.  Try to top this: \\"I am not a robot, I am not a monkey, I will not dance even if the beat's funky\\".  And here's one that's a little more serious and perhaps a response to all the people complaining that Minutes to Midnight wasn't as good as the band's previous efforts: \\"'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse, 'cause once you got a theory of how the thing works, everyone wants the next thing to be just like the first\\".    \\"Robot Boy\\" is the other song that I really like.  It doesn't sound like anything I've heard Linkin Park do before; hell, it doesn't sound like anything I've heard before.  Which is not a bad thing, certainly.  It doesn't quite have the emotion that the band is known for but that seems to be by design and I think it works well.    The rest of the album...meh.  A couple decent tracks, and some weird stuff.    Overall...if you're a music fan but not necessarily a Linkin Park fan, check out the three songs I mentioned, see what you think.      (If you're a Linkin Park fan...well, you probably already have the album and have already decided it either rules or sucks, so you probably don't need my review to give you any advice!)
B00479SVBU|5.0|Just wanted to add my praise for this wonderful little tool.  I've had it a couple of weeks now and it has worked flawlessly.  It was so easy to install and it works like a champ.<br /><br />I was really surprised and happy by how good this sounds on my car stereo.  I use it to listen to my internet radio station, Coronal Winds Radio, [...] and it sounds excellent. I would have a hard time differentiating a CD from my streamed station.  It sounds that good.<br /><br />I simply hook up my Android HTC Thunderbolt cell phone from the earphone jack into the FM Aux input, using the supplied cable.  The FM transmitter then transmits my streamed station to my radio.  Too Cool!!!<br /><br />I use TuneIn and/or WinAmp on my cell phone to download the stream...  It is so nice to drive and listen to my station rather than what's offered over normal airwaves.<br /><br />I should also note, that there are tons of FREE radio stations on the internet that you can play using your cell phone and this device.  Imagine the possiblities.<br /><br />If you have any reservations about getting this FM Transmitter, do not worry.  This FM Transmitter is not your typical transmitter.  This one works. :o)<br /><br />Get it, you won't be sorry... And shipping was quick.
B0046W1692|3.0|No es malo el CD, pero sinceramente esperaba mas...    simplemente es mas de lo mismo de Mana...   para mi la mejor cancion es la version alternativa de \\"No te rindas\\"
B004GHNHVW|3.0|My first impressions remind me of the type of songs from his more recent albums Surprise and You're the One.  In fact, I would say this album is like a hybrid of those two....i.e., exploration of new techniques, combined with modern techno sounds, and mixing in various political/philosophical themes at his will.  It is being said that this is his best work in 20 years (Simon himself) and many reviewers are comparing it with the Graceland album.  Personally, I don't agree.  While very creative, with some songs being fun and quite enjoyable -- \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day, The Afterlife & Rewrite\\" come to mind -- I think overall the flow of the songs is not coherent.  It's a strange mixture of upbeat, then sad/slow ballads...a few of which I am finding it very hard to appreciate.  Specifically, I'm referring to the songs \\"Love and Hard Times, Amulet & Questions for the Angels\\".  Maybe I am being too critical, but it certainly doesn't have that easy/carefree listening of Graceland or even most of his earlier solo albums in my opinion.  This one definitely requires more focused attention and introspection, which are not bad things...just be ready for it.  So, my final analysis?  Well, the title of the album is an appropriate question.  Is it so beautiful...or so what?  Answer...a mixture of both! The song \\"Love & Blessings\\" is an example of this...it starts out beautifully in every way, then transforms into a movement/chorus that not only breaks the flow, but adds a bizarre and discordant 'Bop-bop-a-whoa, ain't no times like the good times Charlie'.  Now, I don't mind silly lyrics or a change in melodic direction, but this one is almost unbearable for me.     -If anyone is interested to discuss my comparison/ranking of Paul Simon's other solo albums, I will be happy to do so. (For general reference, I would rate all of his previous solo albums between 4-5 stars with the exception of one).
B001AQO446|4.0|I'll wait until the BluRay reviews come out. The BluRay \\"Ghostbusters\\" is so bad it makes you look for your VHS copy as an improvement. If only it could be as good as the \\"American Werewolf...\\" package.    And why are there no details? If ever there was a movie I wanted a Digital Copy of, it's this one. Also wondering why Amazon doesn't offer the single-disk extended version DVD (with that, who needs the theatrical release, after all?).    The film is a classic (and all of you who are afraid to see BB2000 should try it - it's terrific) but who needs a sloppy copy? Here's hoping...

1935251740|1.0|I really wonder what happened to Robert Lanza. He was quite accomplished in his field but he seems to have really gone off the deep end with biocentrism. He regularly says nonsensical things based on results which he seems to barely understand from quantum physics. This book is just another new age con game, trying to pretend that eternal life, the soul, etc. all make sense even without a traditional religion and attempting to give them a scientific veneer.

B004PGO25O|4.0|There's nothing creative professionals fear more than the idea that they need a plan, a full plan from beginning to end, in order to complete projects. As a writer, I often fight against having some sort of clue what I'm doing, as I naively believe that structure somehow derails the creative process.<br /><br />This is the Resistance talking. This is exactly what Steven Pressfield's is hoping his readers overcome in what could really be The Art Of War as a manifesto (also a good book). I'm always looking for steps to overcome whatever keeps me from shipping and giving a name to it, the Resistance, allows me to figure out how to fight it.<br /><br />We too often forget that our power as creatives (creative = anyone who has a job that can't be done by reading a manual) is far beyond ourselves and is likely what we are most afraid of. But there is some solace out there, as doing the work solves nearly every problem.

0670022411|5.0|Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has given us an extraordinary book, \\"A Discovery of Witches.\\" In a complicated plot of boy meets girl whereupon they fall in love.  Add to that the complication of different species, vampire vs. witch where the introduction of such couplings is outlawed by the two communities. On top of it add the separate but equal academic creds and loving of polarized families, and you have enough conflict-derived tension to keep you on the edge of your chair for the length of \\"A Discovery of Witches.\\"<br /><br />As imaginatively conceived as the complex plot, even more masterful is author Harkness's development of characterization. Diana Bishop, a bright young history professor, has built a respectable academic career as a researcher. Although she comes from a lineage of witches, she has fought with those tendencies within herself (e.g., she doesn't want to feel she's using her innate witch abilities to climb academic ladders) and uses physical activities (running, rowing, riding, etc. to repress her growing \\"witchiness.\\" To that end she has also refused family education for creating spells and protecting herself. In this novel, we watch her grow and accept herself and her powers and the two of them face the evil congregation.<br /><br />The plot is jump-started when she meets Matthew Clairmont, a strong, handsome, centuries-old vampire of superior academic achievement. The core of this drama is an ancient documents that appear to have had a spell cast upon it. The disappearance of the document becomes a cause celebre for this new \\"third world,\\" daemons, witches, and vampires who gather in the library in hopes of seizing the antique manuscript.<br /><br />In yet another arena for the action, author Harkness has invented a congregation of senior lawmakers for witches, vampires and demons. Among their rules, this organization will assassinate those who intermarry among species. For her burgeoning love affair with a vampire, Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont are marked for liquidation.<br /><br />As these two individuals, Diana and Matthew, try to work their way out of these deadly complications - and moving back and forth between their families' homes, one housing witches, the other housing vampires. Although \\"A Discovery of Vampires\\" is a big book, every page beginning to end is chuck full of excitement and energy as these two unlikely individuals and their just as unique communities walk a tight rope of danger to solve their problems.<br /><br />It's a measure of her consummate skill that Deborah Harkness deftly handles this big book with so many twists and turns, a book where we, the readers, are studying the facts of \\"vampirism\\" and \\"witchism\\" to understand how these very real lovable species of homo sapiens can cope and find happiness. Like all genuinely great novels, \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" educates us about lives we would never know. Author Harkness does this by writing in a style that \\"feels\\" reportorial, a factual report without emboidery - simply assumes we all accept vampires and witches and with that \\"matter of fact\\" style, we are drawn into the drama - and easily suspend incredulity. I recommend that all adult voluntary readers read Deborah Harkness's \\"A Discovery of Witches.\\"for liquidation.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|By far, the greatest song on the album is the title track \\"I Look to You\\".  As much as I love Michael Buble, I think Whitney's version of The Temptation's \\"A Song for You\\" trumps his.  I love how it starts out slow, then becomes a wonderful upbeat dance tune.  I'm not into the club scene, but \\"For the Lovers\\" is dynamite, and any club DJ would be remiss in not playing it often.  The lyrics are excellent!  \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is a good song, especially lyrically.  There is not a bad song on the album.  (My opinion)     Anyone who was/is a true Whitney Houston fan should not only celebrate her coming back, but support her in this endeavor and let her know that we're still out here.  Who among us has never been down...?    Welcome back, Whitney!  Looking forward to the next one.
B004G600A4|5.0|I LOVED this movie, so much, I need to have it in my small collection of movies I love. I think people are overanalyzing messages in this movie. Really, it never occured to me that Mother Gothel is a twisted rep for psycho moms that tells young viewers that moms are not genuine figures? Really? I think people should step back. Yes, there is a stab scene. No, it is NOT gorey at all, no nothing beyond a knife going into Flynn Rider's side. But people should think about this; kids are kids, sure, and they should be allowed to believe in fairytales? Of course. But somewhere, kids need to know; I think that Mother Gothel stabbing Flynn is a scene, not necessary, but adds much to the story by showing that you can't trust just anyone you meet, even if they've been in your life forever. They could still be bad people trying to tear you down; Mother Gothel is that. It shows a reality where people can be bad, and try to take away from you, but I think it also shows that the power of love overcomes people who hate you. In the end, Flynn survives and lives happily ever after with Rapunzel; see? Still a happy ending, a ridiculously adorable movie, and it teaches a valuable lesson that people are not always what they seem, that there is evil in the world, definitely, but there is more good than bad.  Kids cannot go through life believing it's okay to trust everyone (kidnappers and molesters ?!) and that everyone is a good, genuine person, because they're NOT. This movie shows that message! Stop trying to peel down all these little meanings, yes it's showing a mother being a horrible mom and being selfish and using Rapunzel, kids should feel loved and know they are loved. But they should also understand they are LUCKY to have a loving mom (and dad?) because some parents do a horrible job with their children.. and look what happens to them ?! Really, take a step back; this movie overall, I find, POSITIVE, and MEANINGFUL, and POWERFUL. It's an adorable, fantastic movie.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|I'm not one to offer my opinions much when it comes to music because it is so subjective. I listen to just about anything that's played and produced well, and my tastes are quite eclectic. However, as I turn 50 this year I have been particularly reminiscent about the music of my younger days, going back to listen and enjoy the stuff that turned me on and inspired me. Most of today's new music lacks authenticity and is so cash/market-driven. Discovering Joe Bonamassa about 6 years ago was like finding a diamond in a haystack. He was (and remains) a remarkable, refreshing musician and an amiable, approachable, genuine human being. So when I came across this release here on Amazon, I knew it was going to be a keeper... I will refrain from reviewing track by track because everyone has aptly covered that here. However, there are a few things worth mentioning. First, the assembly of players here (incl. Kevin Shirley) and the legacy they bring to this project is remarkable. The Trapeze \\"Medusa\\" album remains one of my first treasured rock albums - I was 11 years old when it was given to be by a teenage musician/ neighbor. Glenn Hughes' voice is incredible here. In fact, I think I like his voice better now than ever; with the onset of age and life's seasoning, he sounds more impassioned than ever, and I can tell he is truly loving this gig. I am glad to see an artist like him having such a great opportunity to get back to his roots with enormous enthusiasm... Joe Bonamassa is searing throughout. I can imagine him praticing as a kid with some vintage recordings, seeing his dad walk in with a record and saying \\"Hey, work on this song little Joe. It's called Medusa.\\" For a kid that was playing Voodoo Chile when he was only nine, a project like this must take him back to why he fell in love with music in the first place. (As for this album, my jaw drops everytime I hear him tear thru that wicked lead in 'Beggaman'. Just phenomenal.)... Jason Bonham has turned into a veritable freight train in his own right. His drumming is absolutely killer. We're all still haunted by the legacy of his father, but that just adds fuel to the chemistry of this band. Wonderful... Derek Sherinian brings to the table, of course, his flawless contributions to Dream Theater. Although somewhat understated in this recording, he is massive in his own right and I'm sure he'll be cutting loose in live performances and more of his influence will find its way into future mixes... My ONLY critique is that there are a few too many songs. In my opinion a few tracks come off as having either been afterthoughts or B tracks. But that's just my taste; the other tracks are so completely solid and make up for any tracks that may feel less stellar. Hey, I'll take whatever I can get from these guys! BCC has been a real fist-pumping treat for me. Can't wait for BCC 2 and maybe a chance to see them live.

B004PGO25O|5.0|When I first received this book on my Kindle app, I wondered why. Now, I'm so very glad it came. I probably would not have read it otherwise.

In a few short pages we are given the tools and desire to go complete that project we set aside so long ago, pursue that vision that had become so dim. My heartfelt thanks to Amazon and Ge for making this book available.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|For those who fear death, this movie offers an intelligent account of the possibility of an afterlife.  It's neither religious nor preachy.  Three separate stories are held together by the main character, a psychic sensitively portrayed by Matt Damon.  The movie attempts to provide insight into what occurs after death, possible communications with the deceased, and a search for a departed loved one. Hereafter ends with an uplifting sense of  life and death.
0316056863|5.0|I am a 64 year old avid reader and never in my life have I read a smarter and funnier book than Tina Fey's \\"Bossypants.\\"  It was an airplane read for me. At airports, I am the mole than finds an isolated corner to read undisturbed by cell phone conversations, and on planes I huddle next to the window wanting to talk to no one.  Both in the airport and on the plane, I actually laughed out loud for extended periods of time.  And when I got home, I ordered copies of \\"Bossypants\\" to send to friends and family...all of whom are still laughing as I write.  If you want to laugh long and hearty, treat yourself to \\"Bossypants.\\"  Then join me in thanking Tina Fey for bringing so much joy to this world.
B003VBVQKS|3.0|\\"Come Taste The Band\\" would mark yet another lineup change for Deep Purple.  Out was original guitarist, the legendary Richie Blackmore, and in was young hot shot Tommy Bolin.  Bolin fills in admirably here adding a bit of funk to the tried tandem here to great effect.  The material here is a mixed bag.  There are not really any classic Deep Purple tracks to be found here and overall the writing is just ok.  The funk oriented direction of some of the tracks sounds quite dated today, but the album still manages to rock in places.  If you are new to the band this is not a place that I would start, but if you are digging further into the Purple catalogue this one is worth owning.  This would be the last Deep Purple album until the band re-formed in the mid-80's.  Within a year after this album's release Tommy Bolin would be dead of a drug overdose and most of the rest of the band would struggle with substance abuse problems as well.  Coverdale would go on to form Whitesnake with the remnants of the Deep Purple rhythm section.

1439190275|5.0|I had heard about this diet many years ago, but was skeptical because as a physician I had always been taught to include carbohydrates in the diet. My parents had tried the original diet many years ago, and lost lots of weight, but I wasn't fond of all the meat and cheese they were eating. My parents tried this diet again recently and were losing lots of weight again quickly, so I decided to purchase this book to read more about it. I read the entire book in one day and was very inspired. I tried the diet immediately and lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks. I did initially have some headaches, but they went away after I introduced more carbohydrates (nuts/berries). I like how 15 base carbohydrates are required daily, and I'm eating more vegetables now than I have in my entire life. I feel great now and even inspired some other physicians in my group to also try the diet. I highly recommend this book!

B004SKJIEC|5.0|Audio Fidelity adds to their 24K Gold CD series another masterful and beautifully mastered work from   the catalog of Stevie Wonder.  The company has previously released three Stevie Wonder titles from   the so-called, \\"Classic\\" period widely considered his most brilliantly creative and productive between   1972 and 1976. Joining \\"Fulfillingness' First Finale,\\" \\"Music Of My Mind\\" and \\"Talking Book (with the   original Braille packaging),\\" this version of Songs In The Key Of Life honors that musical pedigree and   makes this 4-time Grammy award winning album the new benchmark. I make this claim for the   standard of sound is truly elevated and distinguished when compared to either the original albums,   the Motown remasters, and to the ears of this long-time-Stevie-fan I include my batch of the SACDs   from Japan.  In the capable hands and tools of mastering engineer, Kevin Gray these CDs have   perfect detail, clarity and warmth...this Songs In The Key Of Life is a superlative edition.    The double-CD package includes the original bonus tracks as well as a 32-page booklet of lyrics,   credits, thanks and the jottings (and signature) of Stevie Wonder.  And, of course, contained are a   quantity of classic songs, guest performances by legendary soul and jazz artists and a quality of art   and craft that have made Stevie Wonder a superstar and so many of these songs evergreens:  \\"I Wish,\\" \\"Sir Duke,\\" \\"Another Star,\\" \\"As\\" and \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" among the standouts. I always enjoy   hearing them again and I have never heard them sound better.  This company and its staff have done    such wonderful and respectful work on the Stevie Wonder catalog one can only hope they soon visit   other talent from the Motown stable or at least further explore both classic and contemporary soul   and R & B artists and music.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Having heard from several friends about this band, I still turned my nose up at listening to it. I'm not into \\"Americana\\" or \\"modern folk\\" and just the label \\"indie\\" makes me cringe like a toddler being offered brussel sprouts. So my first formal meeting with M+S was by accident. I heard a song in passing and thought it was the lead singer of Justin Furstenfeld of Blue October. If Blue October were making folk music. Then the lyrics caught me. The chorus haunted me for two days until I finally googled to discover the song and artist. It was at this point that I put my preconceived bias aside and opened my mouth to the spoon. It was not love at first listen but it was...something intriguing. Much in the manner in which I fell for Florence and the Machine, the more I listened, the more I couldnt NOT listen. The more I needed to recite the lyrics like a prayer for courage and for comfort. I cant promise that you will like this band's music any more than I can promise that you will try brussel spouts and like them. But I LOVE THEM!

This crap is terrible and proves that just because you can get blown out of your mind on acid and play the national anthem with a guitar and pop can as a pick, doesn't mean you can write good timeless music. Jimi's dead and i wish he would've taken his crappy overrated music with him!
B0014L5Z18|5.0|I can definitely understand how people may be critical of Tarja's first work of original post-Nightwish material. It is not the same as Nightwish, but when you think it, no one should ever expect it to be quite the same thing. It is with this album that Tarja is struggling to find her true individual self. She definitely sings with much more variety in tone than she ever did with Nightwish, but that is to be expected.<br /><br />To better illustrate this, this is very much a parallel to the time when pop legend Peter Gabriel left Genesis around 30 years before Tarja left Nightwish, and then struggled with his first couple of solo albums to eventually find his true self on his third... and now look at what he has accomplished! So with the subsequent solo album \\"What Lies Beneath\\" on top of this bit of history, there is all the more reason to believe that Tarja has alot ahead of her in her solo career.<br /><br />Okay, back to the album itself. I especially enjoy the songs \\"I Walk Alone\\" and \\"Lost Northern Star\\" along with many of the others. The song \\"Oasis\\" sounds like it belongs on an Enya album, but hey, Tarja's abilities are more than compatible with such a style, and she did a great job with it. The Alice Cooper cover \\"Poison\\" was definitely catchy, and even kind of funny. I know this might sound strange, but I thought that even the short interludes, especially \\"The Escape of The Doll\\" were really intriguing.<br /><br />Overall, when seen from the proper perspective in terms of transition, this album is truly a work of art, and I have no objections whatsoever. Tarja has become by far my favorite female singer, with or without Nightish, and I really hope she keeps going.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|I ordered this 3-disk set just so I would receive the special features disk. To my disappointment, the special features were Blu-Ray format only. I paid extra, thinking that two of the disks would be DVDs with the Blu-Ray movie on the 3rd. It would have been helpful if the product description had made this clear. And, after downloading the digital copy for hours, it would not play on my ZEN. All in all, I would have been better off just renting Deathly Hallows from Amazon and watching it on ROKU. As to the movie, I loved it because of its faithfulness to the book and the impressive acting of the main trio, who have grown brautifully into their roles.

Yes, it's supposed to be stupid and I get that - I like stupid, not only do I like it, I love stupid. I just felt this movie didn't live up to what I excepted. Maybe I'll watch it for a second time when it releases on DVD, but I just didn't like this movie that much. By the way, I love Pineapple Express, Superbad, Hot Rod, Step Brothers, Knocked Up, 40-Year-Old-Virigin, ect. I love those movies, but this one didn't really do it for me.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|I think Dave Grohl knew the Foo sound was losing steam and becoming a bit dated.  Everything on this album has an instant classic feel.  It feels like Grohl is channeling Cobain, if not referencing him, on a few tracks.  Aside from the renaissance frontman, the drumming in particular stands out and is expertly mixed. The analog-based production is outstanding, a lack of digital enhancement gives the whole album a raw, live feel, while still having a very layered sound that finally pushes this 90's alternative band into the next century.  Zero filler.  Listening to this album, you get the feeling it's going to be big.  I have been let down by the last few Foo albums, too bubblegum or self-aggrandizing for me to take seriously.  This is definitely the best since Color and the Shape.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I was impressed with the first Iron Man, but they totally blew any typical sequel expectations way out of the water with this one! Great job with the graphics, the fight scenes, the characters. Only a couple minor complaints about unrealistic points, but hey, suspend disbelief, right? Loved it so much I watched it three times in the space of a weekend! (with help from other fans) Great job, guys, great job!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Well I'm not to sure what to say about a memory card so here it goes ! The memory cards that I have purchased have been Wonderful due that the ones that were in the play station given to my grandson had adult content on them and not appropriate for a four year old ! The new ones are Wonderful ! Thank you very much !                      Teana
