B0001HLVS2|5.0|Master and Commander: Great to see this film again.  And read the book to. I recommend to anyone looking for a great adventure story.
0812973992|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted novel that explores the things that bind us all together by following a collection of seemingly disparate characters who all witnessed a single event: a man tight-roping. This is one of those rare novels that is both entertaining and truly literary. I honestly believe that Colum McCann is one of the greatest writers of our time and I can't recommend this book strongly enough.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I didn't want to put it down and even found myself laughing out loud on occasion.  I especially liked how I was able to follow the story despite not having a finance background.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good story  good graphics.  the file is huge so it runs kind of slow.  some very tricky areas where the clues dont help you.
B009POCFTG|5.0|Awesome flick! Might very well be Matthew McConaughey's best performance. He's fantastic; both sexy and scary. A shame his performance has gone largely unnoticed. Juno Temple is great as well. The last half hour is just insane. Obviously the film isn't for everyone, but it's an expertly-crafted grindhouse thriller for those who can dig it.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie was very slow. It was also the exact same plot as the other Bourne movies just less exciting.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It is heart breaking and heart touching. It truly tells how our service people have devoted their lives for our protection. My prayers are with all the men and women that are serving our country. Praying for all the families that send their loved ones off and especially for those that have lost loved ones. My heart goes out to all!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|I bought this for my eight year step-son to hold some of his lego's and to use as a backdrop for this other lego and star wars toys. I thought it would be a little bigger, but still he loved it and it did hold quite a bit. Great for travel! He can bring a few things and have a place to play with it. Great for the price.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Love this game! I just wish it was longer.  I hope they come out with a sequel.  This game reminds me of the Myst games.  I noticed when I finished the game and came to do the review it had an update. So if you buy the game maybe you should go back and see if the update is available before you play. UPDATE THEY ADDED A BUG RPPRT BUTTON.  This game is highly recommended for anyone who likes Adventure puzzle games without the hidden object element. If you have played puzzle games you will recognize some and some are new.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book focuses on the political prowess of arguably our most effective political president.  His accomplishments as president were never, in my opinion, more clearly revealed.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|This is a waste of money the volume is so low it is way better to use video without the mic. If you are reading i suggest you don't buy this. It is a waste of money.
B004GYY714|5.0|My son helped me find this so I could listen to the radio on my Kindle.  It works great and also keeps all of your favorites in a list!!
B009329Y30|4.0|The movie is really good but the differences from the book kind of bugged me to much to really enjoy it and give it 5 stars.  My recommendation is to watch the movie first and then read the book and you won't be disappointed.
B0053F03MM|3.0|Not sure why this movie is not available to rent... only to buy.  Its a good movie but not a classic that i would like to have in my personal collection.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Is was good. Not much to say then funny and amusing. The ending was weird but I loved it. 5 stars
0307387178|2.0|It's a really great book, had to read this for my summer reading, their were two issues though:<br /><br />1) it took over 2 weeks to arrive at my house, and that time really made it difficult to finish on time for school<br />2) be careful when ordering to make sure you order a new copy because the used ones are VERY used, as in you can still read them but my cover was all bent and curving upwards
030758836X|3.0|The first half of this book is well written, cleaver,  intriguing and fast paced.  Then is just all falls apart in the second half.  5 stars for the first half and 2 for the last.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I didn't actually buy the watch, just trying to get the review off my needs to be reviewed.  Looks like a cool watch and I'm sure it is.  I remember a few reviews saying it's like a kid's watch and kinda small though......
B00009APFU|5.0|They should have stopped after making this album. Couldn't wait for their next album to come out . Little did I know this was as best as it was gonna get!

B003G4W49C|4.0|I read Speakers for the Dead first, but this one really fills in a lot of blanks.  My friend Wendy H. turned me on to OSC and his Ender books.  I really like them.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|Love their work and the smooth tone of their voices. Definitely something I take joy in listening to when I just want to relax.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I liked this book because it was very dorky, funny, and interesting. I would recommend this book to a 2-6th grader.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Awesome movie. Loved how it bad characters from past movies without giving away the plot. Relly excited to see how they may work in another bourne hit.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good mind-stretcher, love the variety of layouts. Took me a few minutes to realize that the flower pieces don't have exact matches, but that is part of the fun.
0767903862|4.0|After I received a poor quality book, I was very pleased with the handling of my complaint.  A replacement was sent to my satisfaction and was of better quality.
B005WMADYE|4.0|It satisfied all of my expectations. It has custom vehicles, interesting characters, and a story that keeps you at the edge of your seat. I recommend REDLINE to anyone who loves anime as well as custom rides.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Delicious tunes. The melodies flow like the river from Babylon. The dubstep is sick nasty fo sho yo! Buy it now.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|l gave in to peer pressure and bought this ebook - all the hype about it - I thought it must be really wonderful.<br />It's an OK story, a good yarn to pass a slow Sunday, but a literary masterpiece it most definitely is not.<br />Dont think I will be getting the rest of the series....
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I found this guide very informative and a great help to me in preparing a book for publishing by Kindle
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Ryan Gosling overtakes Jason Statham as the stoic man behind the wheel. Like his bald-headed rival he gets into trouble when distracted by a woman and is hurled into a plot involving gangsters and hitmen. While Louis Leterrier's French thriller tried so hard to be Hollywood, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn's LA-based thriller tries very hard to be European, and takes the viewer on a ride down a lost highway.<br /><br />At the same time it also comes across as a secret remake of Walter Hill's The Driver. All of these films are very, very similar, but Drive is the best of them. It's difficult to comprehensively review the movie as it is very minimalistic and focuses more on atmosphere and the quiet moments in between dialogue rather than action and twists. It's a wonderful movie to look at though, and I do want to complain about how problematic the morals and values of the unnamed 'Driver' are, but if it is the intention to make him morally ambiguous then I guess it is successful. It doesn't make for a great character regardless of how smooth Gosling plays him.<br /><br />The violence is harrowing and brutal, as it is in real life. Nicolas Winding Refn seems to understand that there is no action in real life, there is only violence, and it's brutal and ugly and not something any sane person wants to happen to them. In this respect it is far more grown-up than The Transporter but cannot be praised as being a 'better' film as it is still sold on style and visuals. The substance takes a back seat and the movie apologetically delivers what it wants without feeling the need to scream for attention. I have to respect it for that.<br /><br />Shot in ProRes 4:4:4 the movie looks great in 2.35:1 1080p. The blacks are gorgeous and the daylight scenes look just brilliant. It sounds just as good in DTS HD-MA. There are a small amount of extras.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not what I expected but meaningful. Hard to picture Emma Watson but I think the movie might be long and drawn out
B0038NN3B4|3.0|Kimkins .com is Atkins modified for counting calories, carbs and fat grams, but it's been around for a few years more than this book.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I love this book series. It is a perfect read for anyone who likes fantasy. I can't wait for the third one.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have seen all the movies of this story and they hardly vary from this original including dialogue.  I guess you can't improve on perfection.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I love apps that you think and work the noggin instead of swiping the screen like a maniac. While the graphics are nothing mind blowing it gets the job done. More importantly it's about solving puzzles and there are enough here to keep you buzy for awhile. The puzzles start off easy then they ramp up.
0767840135|5.0|I had never seen a Cirque du Soleil production prior to seeing Quidam live this winter, and I was blown away.  Quidam is absolutely stunning and breathtaking, with a very moving story.  It's difficult to see how the acts fit into the story, but the story is there nevertheless and it's a beautiful one.  I can't wait to show my friends Quidam with this DVD!
B0091REZMW|3.0|While it is true that you have the option of paying to get more gems or gold, it is not absolutely necessary. Many of the items that you can buy for gems can actually be found as a prize for completing one of the hidden objects games. In this way, gems can be used to expedite the process of killing a creature or something like that. Furthermore, you do not have to &quot;quit the game or buy gems,&quot; as some others have suggested. You receive a few gems every time you level your character, and again, you don't NEED to even use them.<br /><br />Likewise, it is erroneous to assume (as other players have mentioned) that you need energy to play, and that energy costs diamonds. While it is true that each room you play costs energy, it is also true that your energy refills over time. Run out of energy? Simply wait for a few minutes and play a different game for a while, OR use a few gems to expedite the process.<br /><br />Overall, I find this to be an OK hidden objects game. The one downfall is that it is true you are often searching for the same types of items in each room. But, on the up side, at least the objects are not always in the same place, and as you continue the game you are required to find an increasing amount of objects in each room.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it the first time in theaters (I ultimately saw it three times in theaters), and I thoroughly enjoy having it amongst my DVD/blu-ray collection now, too.
B001CDZZI6|2.0|I have to say this was interesting, but nothing that shocked me.  And the fact that it only gives you the first 5 is a little disappointing. I would have liked a little more guidance as to what to do with my top 5.  It was interesting but like I said, nothing I didn't already know about myself.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I was really impressed with the singing and the music was great! The movie was fun although predictable and the ending was a little abrupt but overall very satisfying.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is the best of its kind because it enables speedy jewel matching and you can hit multiple matches.
B005OJTVMK|5.0|Decided to get this in this color so that I wouldn't get my Kindle confused with my husband's.  it makes it stand out on the coffee table and easy to grab when I am in a hurry so that I end up with the right books on the right device. I like the fact that there is a pocket on the one side so that I Cana tuck in a piece of paper for notes or whatever else I need.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|This is great--for your own library or as a gift to a Springsteen fan, or someone you want to introduce to Bruce. I always liked him, but finally got to see him last March perform live in Greensboro. It was for my 51st birthday. I waited too long, and if I have the chance to see him live again, I will. It was a near religious experience. You can't fully grasp who he is as a person, as a musician, as our unofficial poet laureate unless you see him live. This DVD captures all that including his humor, and the great relationship he has with the member of the E-Street band, minus Patty (she's not on it). But the Big Man is--probably one of the last well recorded videos of him. It's really not to be missed, well worth the purchase ( I bought it for my husband)
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Best character ever. A definite switch from the Shrek franchise but still a worthy spin off and while I did find the Humpty character rather creepy the movie and and fun interaction between the cats was well worth adding to my extensive DW collection
034580404X|5.0|I have not had a chance to read it but co-workers love the book, can not wait to read it
B0091REZMW|4.0|so many levels. this game is one of the best out there. a lot of fun and mystery in the Manor!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|My daughter likes this game and I often find myself wasting time playing these mindless games to help her amass enough points to unlock new games. The games are simple but there are lots of levels to unlock and special game opportunities are occasionally offered. Probably not the most exciting game on the market but a great diversion when you need a few moments of mindless escape.
1592402690|4.0|If you are a Beatles fan, you will find this an enjoyable read. Geoff Emerick was the engineer on several of their albums, including Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, Abbey Road, and part of the White Album. His memoir puts you in the studio with the Beatles as they recorded some of their greatest music. There are times of great playfulness and fun and also those of anger and heavy drug use. So poisonous did the atmosphere eventually become that Emerick actually quit during the sessions for the White Album. It's a book with triumphant moments, such as the recording sessions for Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. But it's also a sad book, as we witness the slow disintegration of the world's greatest band. Emerick gives great insights on these four young men from Liverpool, and also on George Martin, Yoko Ono, and many others in the Beatles' entourage. Emerick hit it off with Paul McCartney, and so the book is heavily biased in his favor. John, George, and Ringo don't come off very well. Emerick also talks frequently about what \\"we\\" created. The engineer is certainly important in the recording process, but I felt that, like George Martin, Emerick sees himself as being a bit more important than he actually was. These criticisms aside, this is a well written book that Beatles fans are sure to savor.
B000002GVO|5.0|I bought this just for the sound track &#34;Hotel California.&#34;  I have and will always love that song.  Glad I have it now.
B0087HT36U|4.0|it is a lot of fun but very diffacult and uses a lot of strategies to win some of the awards are practically impossible
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so awesome !!!  It kept me wanting to read more and more of this book when everything started happen!<br />BEST Nicholas sparks book EVER!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids and I absolutely love this app...they are so competitive with each other and with these games it pays by getting to unlock new games the more they play.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson does a good job wrapping up Jordan's epic series by taking some of Jordan's minor characters (here's looking at you, Talmanes) and making them uniquely his own.<br /><br />Most of the series questions are answered (where *WAS* Demandred that whole time?) and all the characters are in jeopardy.<br /><br />The battle sequences are a bit lengthy, but not so much so that i'd knock a star off the review.<br /><br />Also, as an FYI, the overall rating on this book is much higher than reported.  The 3 or so stars it had at the time of this posting was due to people complaining about not having an ebook version. Seriously 250/600 reviews were just whining about no kindle version.
B004DM0UII|3.0|Great look, easy of use. Nice coverage, lots of stations and awesome variety. But, why such apps ask for too many permissions? This should be regulated. Lets see.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game, great for those bored or slow moments in life.<br />I highly recommend adding this game to your collection of games.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|omg I tried it cause it looked cute but its super addicting I LOVE it , you will too. its so much fun I mean you bump pudding with eyes buttons and mustachios you should try it.  ; D
B0050KU3IY|5.0|adorable story, easy to read, funny, sweet. likeable characters. only thing that bugged me was that surely a permanent trans atlantic move wouldn'tbe decided from one day to the next with no mention of visas etc. that may be a bit nit picky but ithink even fiction should be realistic. apart from that it's beautiful story.

B00865P3AS|4.0|Here's the 2nd \\"crossover\\" album by Croatian cello players Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser. (I haven't heard the first one but - on Amazon - folks seemed to like it.<br />These guys became a big hit - apparently - when they appeared on the TV series \\"Glee\\" with Glee star Naya Rivera and there is a YouTube going viral.<br />On this album the two cellists have lots of big name company as guests. The first track, \\"Oh Well\\" is the early Fleetwood Mac hit  (written by Peter Green, when he was in the band). Elton John is the guest here and he provides vocals to the electric cellos. It gets the album off to a great start. There more pop (hits by Rhianna, Cher and The Police) and rock (AC/DCs hard edged \\"Highway to Hell\\" - with guest Steve Vai  on guitar and Muse's \\"Supermassive Black Hole) than I cared for and it's certainly like nothing else on Sony Masterworks (the label). An interesting track is the 6-minute version of \\"Clocks\\" (the Coldplay hit) with the cellists and Lang Lang on piano. Others I liked were the one original by the pair (\\"Orient Express\\"), the Italian song \\"The Book of Love\\" with Italian superstar Zucchero, and the closer, \\"Benedictus\\" (the dou accompanied by two keyboard players. This last track is the closest to a \\"classical piece\\". The 46 -minute CD is accompanied by an 8 panel booklet with more photos than info (basically the track listing). In one of the four photos of the duo they are shown with acoustic cellos; the others show them bearing electric ones. I can't tell for sure if the acoustic ones were used on the album, but if they were, it was sparse.<br /><br />This is a fun album to listen to at least once, and I'm sure there will be a fan base, but those who are not fans of electric guitar riffs should be aware that electric cello riffs sound pretty much the same.<br />Another album that will get a boost from Youtube videos.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

B005K0HDGE|4.0|...if a nightmare is confirmation that King still has it, then King still has it. I've already had one, which amounted to me yelling out &#34;Help!&#34; so loudly my dog jumped off the bed and wouldn't come near me for most of the morning. Seriously, I'm loving this book so far. No, I don't love nightmares, but these characters have me reeled in tightly.  I think I know what's going to happen on 11/22/63, but it's King... so, I'm just kidding myself.
B004LKXE08|5.0|I originally had this movie on tape and finally bought it on blu-ray.  Incredible movie and amazing performances.  I have no words to describe Sean Penn's performance.  I highly recommend and I am looking forward to seeing this movie again.  This movie will make you see both sides of the coin of the death penalty debate.

0060855924|2.0|Title: The Color of Magic<br /><br />Year: 1983<br /><br />Returning Characters: Well, this is the first of the Discworld novels, so there are no \\"returning\\" character.  Yet...<br /><br />New Characters: Most of the Discworld novels rely on a revolving cast of characters to populate the stories, and many of the most popular and frequent Discworld inhabitants make their appearance in this, the very first Discworld novel.  This includes: Rincewind, a failed \\"wizzard\\"; Twoflower, the Disc's first tourist;  the Luggage, Twoflower's semi-sentient travel accessory; the Patrician (well, /a/ Patrician, anyway), the ruler of Ankh-Morpork (the Disc's most populous city), and Death, the anthropomorphic personification of the end of life.  HE TALKS LIKE THIS.  Death is occasionally joined by his fellow horsemen, War, Pestilence, and Famine, who make brief appearances in this book.<br /><br />Also making their first appearances in this book are a few of the Discworld's many gods who, like the Greek gods, seem to be made up of the worst aspects of humanity (or, at least those aspects that make for good reality television shows).  Gods include: Blind Io, chief of the gods, and Offler the Crocodile God; as well as two demi-gods: Fate, and The Lady.  Bel Shamharoth, an HP Lovecraft pastiche, doesn't make it past the end of this book before he is vanquished by our heroes (um, spoiler alert), but he does come back as a mini-punchline in later books.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, and there's dragons in here.  This will be important in Guards! Guards!<br /><br />Review and Summary: Alright, so I'm a huge, huge fan of these books, but this is not the best introduction to the series, hence the slightly-harsh two-star review.  Terry Pratchett's Discworld books have given me some of the largest laughs in my life of reading, and his characters are colorful and memorable, but he gets off to a rough start here.<br /><br />Well, to be fair, I'm somewhat judging these first two books (this, and The LightFantastic, roughly serve as two halves of one book) based on the books that come later.  And it's not just that the later books are better (they mostly are, but some are much, much worse), but they're different.<br /><br />In these two books, Pratchett has the idea to set a tourist (Twoflower) loose in a traditional fantasy world, mostly in order to make fun of such a world.  So we get scenes like a bar brawl, crawls through an eldritch temple, and dragon fights, in order for Pratchett's tourist to say \\"Gee whiz.\\"  Later books in the series will use the fantasy setting to comment on (and make fun of), our modern world.  These books are much better for it.<br /><br />This book opens with Twoflower, a tourist from the far-off Agatean Empire (a wealthy land), arriving at the docks of Ankh-Morpork, Pratchett's most-frequent setting for his books and a traditional medieval-style fantasy city.  Twoflower goes through life looking out through rose-colored glasses, and never truly understands how much danger he is in.  Thankfully (for himself, and for the reader), he quickly meets Rincewind, Pratchett's coward-hero, and frequent protagonist.  After an initial rough start, Rincewind vows to help Twoflower see the world, and they're off on their adventures.<br /><br />You'll notice I haven't told you too much of the story.  Well, that's because it's mostly a string of scenes.  Pratchett has a good sense of narrative, which is not on display in this book.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, it's probably because somebody has suggested the Discworld books to you, and you want to know if you should give them a try.  (Alternately, your idea of fun is to read bad reviews of books you love, and leave angry comments.  Well, have at it.)  Yes, trust your friend and give the Discworld books a try.  Just not this one first.  Try Guards! Guards! if you want to see more of Ankh Morpork.  Or give Mort a try.  Or even Small Gods - everybody loves that one.  But read a few of the later ones, and come back to this only if you're already a fan.  And then you'll enjoy this one even more.

0380729407|5.0|The Disney version of this book that was done in the 1980s really doesn't do this book justice.  The prose is extremely vivid and rich, almost poetic.  This is an excellent tale for readers young and old.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|it is very agrevating because it wont LOAD so i can't play a game but that is only my opinion try it wnd see if i am wrong
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this, it's just enough to protect my kindle, cute and fits snugly. I do wish the front cover was stiffer
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This is a great easy read for teenages and the teenagers at heart. An exciting series for all to enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thought that the first book was better than this. To much emphasis on the preparation than the actual game. More behind the scene was not revealed.

B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is a universe of fun! I love the art, sounds and especially the music! It's so catchy, I'm humming the tune all day long. For just .99cents, this game has seemingly endless replayability and has a unique game mechanic that's both simple and deceptively complicated and challenging. Well worth it! Pick it up now!

From what I gather talking to her mom, she's been cooking up a storm from it(no pun intended!), and she loves it! I looked it over myself after receiving it and it looked like it had some very good recipes in it. I might even order it for myself to see what I might conjure up from it!
0765325950|5.0|Excellent.  With so many loose ends to tie up, Sanderson completes Jordan's WoT series with a spectacular battle that IS the book.  Some here seem to object to the some major characters are dealt with in the \\"end,\\" but realistically speaking, had Sanderson given each and every significant character been given the proper \\"treatment\\" this series would have gone on to book 15!  Jordan wove a world of complex characters and inter-twining lives that made this series what it is.  To end it, therefore, isn't going to please everyone everywhere when, quite frankly, you have to just end it!  SO, please realize that if you've had a favorite secondary or tertiary character, you may not be happy with how their particular thread is handled.  BUT, they aren't the main characters!!!!  Come on, people.  This book has always been about Rand, Mat, Perrin, Nynaeve, Egwene, Lan, Aviendah, and Elayne.  They have been the backbone of this series, and their stories are finished satisfactorily, in my opinion (ok, I would have liked a little more detail on Mat's fate, but 1 out of 8 isn't bad).  Its a great read, fast paced, and exciting.  If you are truly a fan of this genre and this series, you will appreciate the care Sanderson has given to Jordan's story and the characters we've come to love.  If you're not, and just some passing reader, then you may be overwhelmed or out of touch with the whole thing--but you will be entertained.  And to those people who are giving a 1 because the book has a delayed release on e-readers...come on, read the book and rate IT, don't rate the book because you're angry at the publisher's decision.  Anyway, may the Light shine on you all! :)
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|This series does not adhere to the Conan Doyale storylines as others have, but rather loosely utilizes character biographies and plot elements to create the series. It is an interesting show, occasionally smart and with a good rapport between the main characters. The focus through the fist half of the first season has been in building the characters and developing relationships, sometimes a bit slowly. Hopefully the introduction of nemisis Moriarty will liven things up.
B008S80PCE|4.0|Like hearing songs not on his usual most popular playlist.  Standard songs taped during live concerts sound fresh and reworked on several of the cds.  Wonderful set!
B007RTAR64|4.0|Wife was very happy with this doll. She was hoping it would look more like the movie character Katmis, but overall she was satisfied.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset as a Christmas present for my older brother. To hear him talk, the headset is very good. His words were, &#34;When playing Battlefield 3 and a tank drives by, you can hear the gears in the engine turning.&#34; Sounds like a win to me.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I saw the previews for this movie and thought it was going to be terrible. So my husband and I sat down to watch it I could not get up it was amazingly awesome. It was a great movie..... I would easily give it 6 stars!
B0026P3G12|5.0|The product arrived in good condition in a timely manner. It fulfilled or surpassed the description. We are very pleased. She has a beautiful voice.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I bought this album becuase I am a big Iced Earth fan, and I was pleased \\"The Glorious Burden\\" Album, but felt as though it didn't match up to thier classic stuff. Shaffer's writing seemed to be repetitive and uninspiring, but once the first riff dropped, I knew I was in for something special. The music was so aggressive, keeping the listener begging for more. In my opinion, its the heaviest album Shaffer has written since \\"Stormrider\\" and \\"Burnt Offerings.\\" The album also contains an amazing storyline and phenomenal album artwork as Iced Earth always tends to provide, taking musical to another level. I didn't think \\"Ripper\\" would outdo \\"The Glorious Burden\\" , but he did! Go get this, or get any other of their albums. They never let me down!
0060171928|4.0|It is a fun wonderful read.  I do resent its posing as actually having happened.  All indications indicate it can not be true.
B0000252YK|5.0|I am a young dude, who got into the metal scene during my college years in the early 2000's and of course went through Ozzy's classic hits in my progression of heavy music. I never really went into his album catalogue for some reason. Recently I started hanging with an old school Sabbath fan that told me to look through his Sabbath stuff, so I did. I couldn't feel the Sabbath stuff right away so I went toward the Zakk album's since I liked his guitar style. I started with \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\" and loved it. Then went to this album, suggested by my bass player, and found the one Ozzy album that I will live by.<br /><br />Their is an aura around this album that I get that makes it rise above all the rest. It has the darkness of Sabbath yet the swag of the 80's hair metal bands(The good ones).  Other than \\"Shot in The Dark\\" there is really no other song that Ozzy uses in his live sets, which is a mistake, having some monstrous songs like \\"Secret Loser\\", \\"Thank God for The Bomb\\" and the title track. Jake E. Lee is another subject that brings this album to new heights. He's mixed very well and not obnoxiously in forefront like Zakk Wylde (Which I don't mind), but brings a force of speed and melody that invites the listener.<br /><br />1) The Ultimate Sin - 10/10 - Dark, heavy opener, killer track!<br />2) Secret Loser - 10/10 - Everything a great metal song can have is in this song! (One of Ozzy's best songs)<br />3) Never Know Why - 9.5/10 - Great riffs,solo's, powerful vocals.<br />4) Thank God For The Bomb - 10/10 - Great song for the times! Ozzy's sings with passion as always!<br />5) Never - 9/10 - Ozzy doesn't miss a beat along with his band. Very cool bridge into a melodic solo by Jake E. Lee!<br />6) Lightning Strikes - 9/10 - Another powerful song with classic Ozzy melodies. Catchy as hell!<br />7) Killer of Giants - 10/10 - Why doesn't Ozzy play this song? Amazing acoustic intro to a monstrous song! Beautiful<br />8) Feel Like You - 8/10 - The one song that every great album seems to have which isn't bad, just not as good as the rest. Great melodies from Ozzy.<br />9) Shot In The Dark - 10/10 - Need I say more?every great album seems to have which isn't bad, just not as good as the rest. Great melodies from Ozzy.<br />9) Shot In The Dark - 10/10 - Need I say more?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the challenge of this game.  So much fun and I like the colors and the scoring etc.... If I want a simple way to have fun and relax, I can choose the easy ones or I can choose a real challenge if I want to work a little harder.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|I have watched This movie about 20 times. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am a fan of movies with a lot of boats and action chases and if you are too you'd probably like it. You should give it to try. I think it's a really great movie!!!
B000FA5STS|5.0|Great book, easy read. Compelling story with dramatic twists. Moe more movie connections and the last few months ago I think the best
B004V5A7K8|2.0|Too basic of a game to be fun for very long.  The controls aren't as smooth as one hoped, and really don't translate well to a Kindle Fire.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child has built a great character in Jack Reacher, not sure how Tom Cruise could ever play this 6' 5&#34; man, the books are all great though.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Interesting story of olden times and the way things are made to change. You find that &#34; Nothing is Impossible &#34; and that many do not see what is right in front of them
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn did it again, what a great book, I had trouble putting it down.  Mitch Rapp is a man one man not get piss off.  Well written right up until the end with just enough suspense at the end, can't wait for the next book.
0800141849|5.0|Everyone can find someone, you just have to be aware of that which is around you and let it happen
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I am very interested in NDEs so I thought this book would be wonderful.  Most if it included facts about the author's childhood and various medical facts which were boring.  I found I was skipping most of what was written and finally just quit.
B000JO9JHW|2.0|love to see justice done on the bad guy, but too greusome, and he likes it..  not for me anyway
B001QYHH4Q|4.0|Alan Parsons is an acquired taste for many.  The album is great for a night of relaxing alone, or with friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read.<br />Gripping<br />Love the easy read and twist and turns.<br />Exciting....and yet wonderful love story.<br />Well written yet again
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|This movie was so well done. It was funny. It was touching. It was even alittle nostalgic, bringing back memories of old black and white classic horror films. Even my 5 and 9 year old nephews, who normally have irritatingly short attention spans, were captivated by this movie. They didnt even mind it being in black and white! I would (will) definitely see this movie again.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|A very good reference book. From a novice to an experienced brewer, you can learn something from it, and will like it.
0679805273|5.0|This little book is fast becomming a treasure in our family.  I purchased these for each of my grandaughters.  My daughter is having each of their elementary teachers write mementos in the book as the girls go through the first years of school.  What a keepsake!  Thanks for the usual fast Amazon delivery!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Great book even though I have not yet  read the first 2 in this series.<br />I was impressed with the suspense
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|A classic in everyone's kindle. This is one of those books that will still be enjoyed when kindles have gone the way of slate tablets. You are never too old or young to read the tales of Mowgli and his friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing. I absolutely love it!! I bought it on my kindle and couldn't stop reading!!! You are going to love this book!!
1455519006|5.0|I purchased this for my sister for Christmas - she absolutely loved the book, and is new to this author.  I suspect she will read more books by Baldacci.<br />Roberta
B008YWY0HK|5.0|i saw this movie twice and enjoyed it the same the second time.  Great family movie and the shipper was expediate.
0425263908|5.0|I have been an avid Sylvia Day reader for about 3 yrs now.I love historical romance so I googled authors like Nicole Jordan etc... and Sylvia Day's name popped up. The 1st novel I read was \\"Ask for It\\" and then \\"Passion For The Game\\" etc... and the rest of her books. Her books have scorching sex scenes and the characters are very passionate when they love.She is one of my favorite authors way before the hype with FSOG.I read Bared To You 1st and then Fifty,and I can't see how these two books compare! I mean yeah they are about Billionaires who have never been in love,But Christian doesn't have what Gideon does there's no comparison! E L James book I thought was poorly written and it was written in Britishisms,I mean what American college student drinks tea?HELLO.... coffee is what we drink here and the writing itself was horrible.Murmurs,biten lips,3 different ways to say SUPER CRAP!!Christian cocks his head to side so much,I'm surprised he didn't break it.Gasps,whispers,frowns,smirks etc.... repulsive and redundant! I'm on the 2nd book Reflected in you and I know it will be good,because Sylvia Day can write and her stories flow and they will leave you breathless,and wanting more!!
B0058VA2U4|2.0|ive always loved anthrax from the days of armed and dangerous and ive seen them live many times, after waiting for belladonna to rejoin the band i was expecting the thrax of old, the first song on this cd is great i couldnt make it through this cd it was too average no kick in the a** like theyre earlier albums.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|This band rocks.  I heartily recommend them to music lovers everywhere and if you get a chance, you should see them live.  This particular album is a wonder assortment of holiday covers with fantastic arrangements.
B000005AYL|3.0|Erykah is amazing, and all of her albums are excellent.<br /><br />HOWEVER, Amazon failed to disclose that the item is NOT as pictured. As a few other reviews had said, it does not come in the standard sleeve with album art work. Its simply in a black sleeve with a sticker on the front listing the tracks. No where on the description does it say that it comes in a nondescript sleeve. Very misleading.
B000002BYA|5.0|What can I say about Stevie Ray Vaughn. This CD is fabulous and I can't get enough of his wonderful guitar playing. I love the blues.
0545265355|5.0|I got this for my stepdad as a Christmas present, and he loves it. It came in great condition, and looks very nice on his bookshelf.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Probably one of their best Agent Pendergast novels written yet. They just keep getting better and better!<br />I have read all in the series, and am just waiting for hollywood to wise up and start making Pendergast movies.<br />The only drawback is that I have to WAIT several months until the next one comes along.<br />I sure wish that Preston and Childs had a backload of this series created before they were published.<br />Kudos to Preston & Childs ---keep them comin !
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is ok at times. I feel like the writing was a bit immature. There was so much potential for this to be an amazing 5 star book. I like the characters, however, Ana goes from the innocent, to overly verbal and worldly and you wonder how she managed to get there so quickly. I felt the swearing from Ana was out of character and poorly orchestrated. Christian didn't hold true to his dominance. I will read the next book and I hope for a little better formed Characters and plot.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is a great DVD/CD.  The band was in top form for this show in '07.<br />Sounds like they won't play again but we are left with one last incredible performance.<br />Buy it now!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is not what I expected it to be it was a surprise. Shockingly sad and yet full of love and real life
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This was a cute, very adult movie. I enjoyed it although I thought there were alot of scenes that wouldn't be missed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I did enjoy reading this book and feel it can keep you on the alert.  Some people don't even believe there is a God or a heaven, but for those of us who have no doubts, you won't be sorry you took the time to read this one. Heaven is my goal.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love this book it is one I can hardly put down.  This is not the usual book I like to read, but it is keeping me entertained.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I have watched this series over and over again since I purchased it.  It follows what we know of the Tudor era history pretty well.  The costumes and jewelry are phenominal and the acting excellent.  This set is a perfect gift for anyone who is interested in this volatile era.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|There were a lot of laughs, some serious stuff, and some great music arrangements. It was a little sappy in places but over all it was great..
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Very disappointed with this. I have almost always enjoyed a film with mark wahlberg, however this movie was filthy and just plain stupid.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Check this band out on U TUBE/ Dave Letterman. I was fortunate enough to catch the show and knew it would hit U Tube if only for Letterman's sheer reaction of JOY. Never saw Letterman get that excited about anyone on his program....ever!!! The lead singer carries you away and both guitarist's are unbelievable. The drummer is outragious-throwing his sticks around like some reincarnation of Ginger Baker. Can't wait till they tour the east coast. Bluesy/rock/New Orleans thing going on. Check these guys out.
B005OJTVMK|4.0|Cute coral color cover. Color true to picture. Find that the covers bends a bit and does not remain perfectly flat. It was a good Kindle cover for the first year but I will most likely upgrade to the Kindle Cover with built in light within the next year or so.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe is a very accomplish guitarist. sounds excellent and what a playing He will be a great and he is one now
B003QSS2VW|5.0|My whole family loved this film! It was so sweet and easy. There was nothing scary, so my toddler could watch the whole thing. The characters were funny, and the animals were all interesting.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|We love this movie. Quality was great. Shipped quickly and arrived in time for Christmas. Highly recommend this movie. .
B000V63BX6|5.0|In my opinion this is Rod Stewart's best album. There is a lot of folk/country arrangements, mixed in with the gritty guitar of Ronnie Wood. Who doesn't love Ronnie Wood? Some great instrumentation with mandolin, fiddle, upright bass, pedal steel, organ, slide guitar. I had this on 8-track tape as a kid and recently bought the MP3 album. The album was released in 1971 and it still sounds great today.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I got to give it to Bruno Mars, his sophmore album outshines his first one. I have a hard time taking this cd out of my player. I even took a long road trip and found myself coming back to this album to sing along. Great album!
B009YX02T8|5.0|Loved all the movies and I have purchased all the soundtracks. I watch the dvds so much that I can sometimes tell what part of the movie the song came from.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an amazing series. We hope to watch the whole collection. Thank you Amazon for providing this series. Congratulations!
0345803485|3.0|After reading nothing but non-fiction for many years, I finally broke down and read 50 Shades on vacation, on loan from my in-laws. I liked it more than I thought I would.<br /><br />No, the writing isn't top notch, for many reasons. But so what? I don't think the author was aiming for a Pulitzer. When a book sells that many copies and generates a clear bimodal distribution for ratings (i.e. lots of 1- and 5-star ratings), it's worth checking out. And I found I could ignore the author's writing style because I enjoyed the story.<br /><br />This is a love story, and nothing more. Sure, the sex scenes are steamy, but hardly shocking. Yes, there's some cheesy \\"romance\\" stuff. But it's really about a relationship between a complicated woman and a far more complicated man. And, to me, that's always a good topic. There are ups and downs, twists and turns. It was fun to join the ride. It was also fun to talk about with others.<br /><br />A fun read and a good escape.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game.  its so addicting.  I find myself saying just one more puzzle.  I highly recomend this game to everyone.
0545425115|4.0|I don't often read fiction, and over a holiday with my in-laws, I decided to switch it up and read this book. I saw the movie (loved it) and heard the book was more brutal than the film. They were right. The book includes all those gory details not included in the movie - the characters are grittier, Katniss's struggles are much worse, Haymitch is a much darker character, and the deaths of these kids are much more violent. Not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The story has tension from nearly the start, all the way to the end. It's hard to put down at times. I will most certainly read the next two. In fact, they're on their way to my home now!<br /><br />I've heard that some people found the idea of violence to adolescents disgusting. I can understand that. The characters are pawns in a sick game, created by sick people. I know people who were very disturbed by this book but didn't find the violence of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo nearly so bothersome. I feel the opposite. But everyone has a different tolerance to different kinds of violence.<br /><br />A minor criticism: the book's narration tells us a lot of things that would be better \\"shown\\" or just left for the reader to decide. But no book is perfect and every author has her own style.<br /><br />Either way, a damn good story.
075669812X|5.0|My son loved this item. It includes the green ninja and a lot of information of every character of the series.
0345803493|3.0|When I read the first book on vacation (NOT my usual reading fare), I enjoyed it but had no intention of reading the remaining two. But once I finished it and returned back home, I found myself wondering about what would happen next. The end of the first book was sad, and for some embarrassing reason, I wanted to see what would happen. Yup, she hooked me :)<br /><br />The second book doesn't have the tension of the first, which makes it a bit less interesting. You know they will stay together. But it does explore a few more avenues in the sexual arena (although still nothing all that shocking), and it delves more deeply into Christian's past and present. As I stated in the review of the 1st book, this story is about an unusual relationship between two people and how it develops. And I enjoy stories like that.<br /><br />I didn't care for the character of Jack, and Mr. Robinson didn't speak like someone of her personality would. I enjoyed the emails just as much as with Book 1. Not as good as the first, but a fun read.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I didn't want to put down.  Once in awhile you find a book like this one.  Just got gone girl now
0385335997|5.0|Having read seven stories in this series, I am completely enthralled by Gabaldon's gift for story telling and writing. These novels are expertly crafted and absorbing with characters one comes to know and care about. Each book is as good as the previous one. The pnly disappointment comes from having to say \\"good bye\\" at the final page.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King books...this one is really good.  It involves time travel and the Kennedy assassination, something for everyone.

0765325950|5.0|This is my first ever review of anything and it contains the most minor of spoilers...meaning things you already expected to happen. First of all, I love this series and was extremely upset when Jordan passed away before finishing the series. I started reading Sanderson's work when I found out that he was going to finish the WoT. I found Sanderson to be a decent writer with a good sense of plotting but somewhat above average writing...nowhere close to Jordan. My fears were somewhat confirmed with the Gathering Storm which was good plot wise but writing was average when compared to the rest of the series. Towers of Midnight was a little better but still not amazing. Well, this book is much much better than those books and dare I say better than any book in the series since The Fires of Heaven. The book resolves all major story lines and some of the minor ones too. It ends in a way that feels very true to the series. Also much appreciated were the constant references to earlier events in the series, especially from the Eye of the World. As others have said, the book is just one massive battle which is what is to be expected. Demandred finally shows up and man is he awesome. Actually the Forsaken are all amazing and if any more of them were still alive, I think the series may have ended very differently. Matt felt more like himself than any book since Jordan passed away. Rand also feels more like he did in the first few books than the last few. There are major deaths and major sacrifices. So was all perfect?  Of course not. How could it be?  Jordan wasnt writing the ending.  Some deaths of major characters are very underwhelming...two in particular are glaringly bad.  Some new names are just terrible...and I am looking at you Knotai. Some verbage feels off from the series but really these are all very minor quibbles. This is an incredible book. All in all an amazing finish to the best fantasy series ever written, even beyond Tolkien, George Martin and JK Rowling.  Allof which I love as well. Tai'shar Wheel of Time...I am going to miss you tremendously.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has very interesting plot twists and the concept was unique. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good read.
B005T87QCI|2.0|do not buy their is<br /><br /> Not for kids under 10 I would say<br /><br /> No replay value after first time definitely not worth 99 cents
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Beatles fan or not, this story of George Harrison is incredibly inspiring and beautifully crafted. I did not grow up listening to The Beatles, so I went into it with a totally open mind. I was moved by his story and efforts. I highly recommend this film.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Extremely well performed and produced.  A completely satisfying experience --- whether a hardcore fan or not.  This set is worth every penny.  Proof that rock 'n roll is still very much alive and well.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|What happens to a fifteen year old when everything he knows and loves are taken away.<br />This is the premise of Richard Ford's book .<br />Richard Fords prose is almost lyrical, which makes for a comfortable read.  His content is<br />thought provoking.His characters ring true.<br />I've read other books by Ford and have never been disappointed. Canada  also did not disappoint.

B002QXIMY0|5.0|This is not only a classic Heavy Metal album it is also Anthrax at their very best! Re-mastering this masterpiece and including a bonus live-DVD made it even better.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I had been hearing about how enjoyable this book was since it's release but only just recently decided to read it. I have to say, everyone was right. From page one I was sucked into this world and couldn't put the book down. A beautiful homage to the nerd culture, but something I think anyone from any culture could enjoy.
B004UID2LC|5.0|have so many things to veiw and injoy watching. enjoy eerything I watch in bed.still learning more about it. Like going to any thing I write in.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Brilliantly funny guilty pleasure type movie. Follows story of a quest between typical collegiate stereotypes but amongst a different world. Definitely a feel good chick flick!
B0038AUY96|5.0|A page turner, well written, unpredictable till the last page, a must read, gonna buy more titles from this writer.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|With a title like Cinder its easy to understand where the plot line comes from. However this twist on a classic fairy tale following a servant with cyborg limbs and discovering her true identity certainly made it more interesting. It wasn't as exciting as other books I've read but there were still times where I would stay up a little later just to read one more chapter. Other times however I felt it was a bit slow or just lacking something to keep my intrigue. Despite all that I will be waiting anxiously for the next book to continue following Cinder.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I've read in a very long time. Keeps you guessing til the end.  So many twists and turns
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was a great read! Fun! Scary at times and loaded with computer and mystery. Can't help but wonder what it would be like to read this book in 10 ten years time. How will things have changed? Curious!
B0083F5JE6|5.0|My son loves it - we got the clean version.  Maroon 5 has great music and we all enjoy it.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|great buy and adding this special edition helped complete our growing twillight collection. would recommend to all twi hard fans
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was sorta boring.  Cute at times and funny here and there but nothing to write home about.  Funny storyline if you think about it but overall just okay for me.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|Every time i try to open the app it crashes and goes to the carousel. I'm so mad that i paid 7.00$ for something that doesn't even work.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|This movie was good, different than the original, but had some of the original elements and themes.  Great cast really makes it worth watching.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I have liked the show since it first came out. I was glad to see it offered in this collection. Any fan of the show should get this!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|missed an episode glad to catch it on here still alittle spendy but kept us up to speed with weekly tv viewings
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|An excellent book, especially the first 8 or so chapters. It got a bit murky toward the end. The list of references is terrific--many many interesting books are listed here that I will never have time to read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|great game but I wish u had hill climb as a amazon app! please talk to apple to release it as a amazon app! please!!!!!!!!!!
0061124958|5.0|Charlotte's Web is one of those books that people tend to dismiss as children's literature, but it's a true literary masterpiece!  I found this really great web series about books and they recently did an episode re-examining Charlotte's Web.  Any fan of the book should check it out!  Link below.<br /><br />[...]
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed the way he chronologically detailed his experience through training and the multiple missions he experienced first hand. Its writen in a way that makes you trust his version. I have no doubt this is the true &#34;un-Hollywood&#34; version.
0817439390|5.0|I LOVED learning about the basics of exposure from this book. It is thorough without being pedantic, clear, and provides creative and helpful exercises in each chapter to help the photographer learn different things about exposure. I definitely recommend it, especially for those who are just starting to learn about exposure.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, although somewhat underdeveloped, is one of the better Philip K. Dick-inspired movies (this doesn't really qualify as an adaptation as the producers have jettisoned everything except the general concept). It's an intelligent and entertaining movie that successfully blends SF and romance. There's great chemistry between the two leads, and their interactions provide much of the impetus for the movie. The idea is a pleasing, if hugely flawed one, and the script is good enough to carry the dubious logic. It's reasonably tongue-in-cheek, although the potential for greater humour was missed. Good, thoughtful entertainment. 3.5/5
B004VYYA2K|3.0|We bought this for a 10yr old for Christmas. She uses it as storage but not much more. It's a little flimsy. Not worth the price.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Very disappointed with this product. They make it seem like it is a full size movie poster but it is not much bigger than a sheet of paper.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|this was a great movie kept laughing till i cried. thi smovie was funny almost from beginning to end. must see
B003O6MC6W|5.0|This album just resonates with my soul and somehow brings me comfort and a deep sense of chill. I found this artist while listening to LINN radio (variety) via my Linn Majik DS, thanks to SoundHound I was able to sample the tune and Jon Hopkins was what popped up. I promptly when to Amazon MP3 and bought it.
B0080GUX2Q|5.0|I wasted a lot of time on positive thinking, visualization and all the other self-help material down through the years.  This book pokes holes in all of it and can free up your thinking in a lot of ways.  Highly reccommended.
B008S80OU2|5.0|I've been a big BOC fan since I was a teenager (too many yrs ago to mention here now), and can't recommend this enough to anyone who loves the Soft White Underbelly. I won't go into a lot of detail bc others have already, but suffice it to say these remasters are crisp & satisfying. Make the move on your feet or on your knees to a store or a computer & buy this!
B00009MGGI|5.0|SUPERB PLOT, ACTING and CONTEXT......the best! Alas, no subtitles or extra features, no &#34;inside look&#34; extras....just the show as seen on TV....well worth it but some features appreciated.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I put this on my tablet but the tiles are still difficult to see.  Probably just my old eyes are the problem.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|The music is good and if you enjoy the songs that you have heard on the radio you will probably enjoy most of the CD. Hope this helps!
B003XDZN8A|5.0|These are narrow enough to wear as a sandal but wide enough to slip on easily over heavy socks. These are my favorite and most comfortable house shoes/slippers. I wear them all year round.  They are also really nice to take traveling because you can gently wash them in the clothes washer after you've walked around in them at a hotel.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|Beautiful songs, sung by a beautiful voice. I really like this album and listen to it all the time. I highly recommend it!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|very simple, cute story about discovery and siblings/sisterhood. i wonder what else the fairies will discover in the next movies. it's a girls' story, but our 5 year old son enjoyed it, too. animation is pretty. storyline appropriate for children.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in a very rural area and the local tv station for the weather here is over 70 miles away. I find this app very reliable for MY local weather.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|One of the best CD's I have ever owned.  I love the dramatic sound! I listen to it on repeat and every time I hear something new!
1449417051|5.0|Cute, funny, humor for all cat lovers, enjoyable read, must have, I look at scrappy very differently now, cats are truly cool!
B00A757EFW|1.0|From the description, and the way apps like this usually work, I figured you would be able to play much more. Instead, you barely get past one level before it takes you back to the main menu.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The whole family loves this series.  We watch it every night during dinner.  My husband requested this as a Christmas gift and is very happy with it.
B007NESBK2|5.0|My wife and I actually attended this very concert in Ontario (Although we couldn't see us in the audience :(). What an amazing gift to be able to replay an amazing night over and over again. the Bluray is of excellent quality- both sound and picture.
1423140591|5.0|My granddaughter loves it! She stays up way too late reading,  She is done with this one and almost done with Book 3
034580404X|5.0|I was sad when I finished this series, wanted it to continue...good deal for all three books too! Will be reading this series again!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love how this book grabbed your attention from the get go. The characters were such thrill, the mystery kept me turning pages, didn't want to put it down! Definitely highly recommend!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'm not finished with this book yet, but I can't put it down!!!  Such an escape into a real world, grounded in magic!
1452110581|5.0|It is a birthday gift for my daughter but I read it and loved it.  I also love the cover of the book.
1423113454|4.0|This was an amazing book it was full of twists and turns.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes a funny and adventure book.  At some parts of the book I couldn't put it down. This book is better than the Percy Jackson series in my opinion.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.  I loved this book and I hope other people can enjoy this book too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Intelligently written and full of commentary about society and social interactions. The science fiction wasn't so far-fetched as to pull you out of the story and the characters were colorful and well-developed. Recommended for anyone who loves sci-fi.
B00005JNS0|4.0|We are catching up on some great kids movies of the last decade and my 3 year olds love this one. I'd recommend it to others.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The previews were so hot, I was really looking forward to a girls night movie watching this. While there were definitely hot bodies and strip routines, the plot was poorly thought out, and McConneghy (sp?) came off really creepy. At the end of the movie, we looked at each other with a kind of &#34;really, that's the movie?&#34; look. Of course it might be a pretty accurate view of a male stripper's life, but I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Heroes are the focus of this story. More focus on Hazel and Frank in this story than Percy. Great book. I Love the part when the go to Amazon.com to meet real Amazon's. It is true that monsters work at Bargain Mart! I like that Percy went to Seattle but the author forgot how many coffee shops there are in Seattle. Read this book!
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book, from a dog's perspective and the bond they feel to us.  It tells a story too about a man and his daughter., very heart warming.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining; hard to put down.  I will seek out the sequel.<br />Obviously the author left a lot of future subject matter.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I find myself using this more and more everyday.  This is one of the most useful apps I have used.  I take notes on meetings, prepare shopping lists and generally feel much more organized than ever.  Every week I discover a new use for this.  Just love it.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This i so entertaining! I've got everybody trying to find the objects. I finished the game three times and am trying to beat my best time now. My friend Donna loves it too and now wants to get a Kindle just so she can play it.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Eckhart does not give you more things to believe in, he teaches you how to think and become conscious.  You will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|3.0|I guess I need to understand the action of the control better, because I am terrible at this game, can't seem to even get to the 2 nd level.
1608871452|5.0|This is something every Supernatural fan should get. There are these 'little bonuses' throughout the book that add to the awesomeness of it.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|I have to admit that I first read this book a year ago. I loved it so much that I recently listened to the audiobook. The narrator wasn't my favorite (in other words, she didn't IMPROVE the print version), but she did a good job. My favorite of her voices was Etienne's British accent!<br /><br />I've read ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS, which was awesome, but I loved LOLA even more. Probably because of Cricket, who is currently my all-time favorite boy in YA. Seriously, I cannot think of another fictional boy who makes me swoon more. He's a brilliant scientist/engineer after my own heart. Plus he's just incredibly SWEET. I know some girls go for the bad boy, but give me a sweet guy every time. Cricket is kind, loyal, and funny. Did I mention that he's swoony?? Tall and handsome, with a serious sense of style. Cricket is as unique as his name.<br /><br />I love Lola's character as well. I love her resolution to never wear the same outfit twice, HA. Lola is flawed in a believable way. She makes mistakes, but understandably so. Her character arc is painful at times, but it has a satisfying end. All the supporting characters are developed and REAL, as if I know them in reality.<br /><br />The last chapter of this romantic comedy is unforgettable. I could not stop grinning. I've read it several times now and it never gets old. If you haven't read LOLA yet, you're missing out!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great tool for daily study of the word of God. Very user friendly application. Makes daily reading much more convenient.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Worth the time; colorful graphics; many, many levels to play; I have it on my cell and my kindle;fun time consuming
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. Sure you have the same screens and even the same items....for a while. then you open a new room and have new things to learn. Also, this game continually updates with new quests and challenges that keep you going. Do you have to pay money?  no. Do you have to wait for your energy to recharge?  yes.  so what?  I check in once a day and play what I can.  BIG HINT : GET FRIENDS AND HELP THEM!  you are rewarded and is one if the best ways to help your game along. have fun!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed reading this series! I will rd comments to friends and coworkers blah, blah, blah, etc, etc, etc and etc!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to stay connected with facebook when I am away from home. As long as I can get wi-fi connection.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|So glad I got this book, if you follow the daily exercises it does create MAGIC in your life! Most of us know the importance of being grateful but are usually too busy and get caught up in our problems so I really like how this book has you focus on different things each day and you realize what an amazing life you already live. THANK YOU Rhonda Byrne! :e)
B005LAII80|5.0|I was surprised to see most theaters never got this film up. I decided to wait for blu-ray because I did not have time to watch but wanted to. I have to say, for something low budget as documentary said, It was pretty intense and well thought out.<br /><br />If your on the fence, buy the movie. Its worth it. I dont even like gore but they did it pretty nicely, artsy rather than clumsy. If you can't stand blood in the movie screen, I caution you not to buy it though.<br /><br />My only complaint is how come a sequel has not been planned yet?
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I have a brand new Blue ray player and my player plays other BR discs fine.  The audio on this set cut out 19 times on the first disc.  I sent is back for a refund.  I really wish this worked.  You can't watch a thrilling movie with the audio cutting out.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I was not familiar with the author but now I am a fan.  I loved the book.  It was a great read and I will read it many times again.  I loved the characters and I loved the way de Rosnay wrote it going between the past and the present.
B00571F26Y|3.0|My wife and I have gone to a gluten free diet and it is helping us in many ways. The book though is a bit too technical for me. I'm sure other health care professionals will appreciate the information. For me, I just needed the highlights and the bottom lines.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book!! I cannot wait to read the next one. Mixed emotions the entire time I was reading the book.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|A great movie that the entire family can enjoy!<br /><br />We enjoyed it from start to end.<br /><br />The humour is appropriate for all ages and is entertaining for adults too.
0765325950|1.0|As an expat living in an Asian country, I always look forward to memories of home.  I read these books growing up and was extremely excited to read them again in my new, very foreign country of residence.<br /><br />I was unbelievably frustrated by the decision to delay the ebook release date.  First of all, I have entirely switched to digital because it's so portable, but I would have definitely made an exception in this case.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book isn't available in my country in hardback, and won't be for some time.  I will likely have the book delivered to me via mail, but if so I won't get it for about a month.  Plus, shipping from the US is extremely expensive.  I would have gladly paid extra to get it on ebook rather than print.<br /><br />I don't normally leave reviews like this, but just wanted to express myself (like many others).  I hope publishers realize what a bad decision this was, when it's all said and done.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app. Works so wonderful. Would recommend it to everyone to use.<br />Try it, it's awesome to use and alert you to the battery power.
B000VX6YCO|5.0|Shoe exactly as described. Fit is good. Very Comfortable. Excellent  good quality. Highly Recommend this shoe. Very Satisfed with this purchase.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The reviews given for this movie prior to my seeing it were very funny a must see.  Well I must not be into that kind of humor because it was very disturbing to me and not funny.  Sorry I wasted $4.00 to see it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  I have been sort of following Bruno since I saw him perform at the Grammy's a few years back and this is the first time I have purchased his CD.  Literally I think there is one song on it that I skip; all the rest I listen to over and over again.  A fan of his style, his swagger, his edginess, and his ability to be a little Sting, a little Michael Jackson, a little Prince, and a lot Bruno Mars!
B005EWDAFQ|3.0|Interesting psychological twist with the main character becoming more obviously the victim of his past. Bit over the top with the machine taking over.
0316056863|5.0|I loved this book!  I actually read it when I borrowed it from the local library and then I had to buy it for a friend of mine.  If you love Tina Fey, you will LOVE this.  I have bought another one since, used for another friend.  Highly recommend it!
B00A13719E|3.0|A great album with a lot of catchy songs but the most memorable is probably Just a Fool with Blake Shleton. Not a country music fan normally but this one stands out and I'm thinking Christina may want to branch out from dancey pop tunes and explore a bit much in the style of Gaga's cherrytree sessions album.
086571701X|5.0|After getting this book for my brother-in-law last Christmas and shamelessly paging through before I gave it to him, I ordered a copy for myself shortly after the new year.  I was (still am, really) a rookie in aquaponics, but I read this book cover to cover and found the vast majority of what I needed to design and set up a system in our apartment (50 gal fish tank/50 gal grow bed currently producing as much thyme, basil, and swiss chard as I can eat).  The author makes a point to cover every design issue you need to consider, laid out in the order in which it should be considered.  The book has a very methodical and logical layout that makes it relatively easy to put together a plan to build a system from scratch. (But you'll still have to do the leg work!)<br /><br />In a few cases, it would be nice to have a little more depth. For example, some fluorescent lights come in different 'color temperatures,' but the author doesn't get into blue vs. red spectrum until the section on HID lights, and then only briefly.  My 'grow light' seems to have a different spectrum (and works better) than my 'daylight spectrum' T8 fixture, but I wouldn't have expected that from the book.  Also, many different strains of tilapia are available with different traits, but the book doesn't go further than differentiating 'tilapia' from 'koi,' 'pacu,' etc.  Most of the missing information is readily available on the web, so this shortcoming isn't a huge drawback.  I should note here, however, that since I wanted to build a small-scale edible fish system, the hardest thing for me was locating a source that would sell me just five tilapia and didn't charge $80-100 for shipping.  I finally found a local tropical fish (pet) store that was willing to order them specially.<br /><br />The author's personal experiences with aquaponics are helpful and make the book very readable.  The \\"10 dumbest mistakes I've made in aquaponics\\" is a good list of things that novices like me should watch out for,and the \\"rules of thumb\\" at the end of every chapter are a great reference when designing your own system.  I can't count the number of times I went back and looked at those guidelines, especially when cycling the system.  In sum, this book is an excellent resource for anyone just getting started in aquaponics.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like upstairs downstairs this show is a must! It's informative as well to the way they lived in the early 1900's.
B00ARAO720|4.0|I did notice that this is a remake of the movie Quicksilver with Kevin Bacon. The plot was different which I thought was a bit lame, but I do have to say, it did keep me on the edge of my seat. I personally liked it; I thought it was better then Quicksilver. If you are looking for some action or advent: )

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app for anyone! I use it daily and would highly recommend it. it's very reliable and fairly user friendly.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|I love hearing about REAL PEOPLE who have overcome great adversity to achieve something special. It gives me hope, that in my own limited way I may be able to make a difference in my community, my world for the benefit of others. My grandgirlie is autistic, and although she is only 5, I believe we can all help her to reach her full potential, whatever that may mean for her; that she'll have a full and meaningful life. Who knows, she may even make scientific breakthroughs, as did Temple Grandin. This video has given me insight and hope in daring to believe in the most for my little grandgirl and help her in any way I can to achieve HER dreams and help push her toward them.<br /><br />I would recommend this video for anyone who is touched in their life by an autistic person---parents, grandparents and extended families and esp. educators--the aunt in Temple's life was a key to unlocking her potential with animals; and sometimes, just one teacher can reach a child like no one else can and inspire the drive to make a dream happen! Even community-- as we all learn to live with diversity, let us not just relegate to the politically correct special interest groups! Autism needs recognition and acceptance; austistic people offer a huge dimension and attribution to our society that can no longer be repressed nor bullied; but needs to be appreciated and valued in the human experience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I are hooked on this series and watch it faithfully, even to the extreme of watching episodes more than once to catch the nuances to dialogue and the beautiful sets and costumes.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|We have relied on TripAdvisor for objective reviews for many years. However lately, we are questioning whether the posted reviews are objective or &#34;planted&#34;.  Our recent experience with some well-reviewed places have been decidely disappointing.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is great app. However, the last update boogered the program so I had to delete it and redownload. Since then hsve really enjoyed playing it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It shows a bunch of ads and barley even plays. This game is free, and were still not getting our money's worth.

B005LAIH3G|2.0|JOHN CARTER,<br /><br />TWO STARS ONLY FOR EFFECTIVE, NOTICABLE EFFORT.  THE PLOT WAS/IS NOT BELIEVABLE.  VISUALLY  &#34;COMMON&#34; FOR THE ADVERTISING RELEASES.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|REALLY enjoyed this book! Hoping for another book ! Maybe a story through young Christians eyes. From his earlier memories.
B0073U2F12|4.0|I found it to be<br />visially captivating, with a good plot.  I did notice, however that it did not have very notable actors/actresses.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It tried to include plot twists, but they were fairly lame. Special effects were minimal, almost (politely) laughable sometimes. Story just didn't grip me. Sort of a cross between a paranormal movie and an action flick. If it was free, on cable, I *might* watch it again.<br /><br />Normally, I like most Bruce Willis action movies. This is one of the rare ones that didn't appeal to me.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Excellent read keeps you engrossed in the characters yet keeps you wanting more. Cannot wait to see how it ends.
0446573027|2.0|As a long time David Baldacci fan, particularly of the Camel Club series, I am disappointed in this book for two reasons: one, it is a Lee Child knockoff and unworthy of a writer of Baldacci's stature and two, it has an Agatha Christie ending.  For any reader of this genre, John Puller, Baldacci's protagonist, is Jack Reacher with another name.  It is pointless to argue otherwise.  The Agatha Christie ending is not very plausible.  Many writers in this genre, James Patterson, Jack Higgins, or Robert Ludlum, to name but a few, run out of new ideas and simply grind along on a past reputation.  I hope this book is not a similar direction on the part of David Baldacci.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!! I can't stop reading. Can't wait to read the rest!! I'm not a big reader but this story has me hooked!!
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|It was recommended  by many to check this out. So I did. What a waste of time..not scary, and not original.It felt like they put as much crass material into the series just to see how far they can push,  and  see what they can get away with. The opening scene had promise, but it then fell into cliche after cliche. ( people splitting up and running around in the dark)  The ending was so anti climatic, not to mention it ripped the ending straight from Beetlejuice. if you have seen Rosemary's baby,sixth sense, beetlejuice, Legend of hell house, The haunting, then their is no need to watch this. Those movies did it better.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Great show, Andy Whitfield was hard to follow, but they did a great job. I cant wait til next season!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|It was a struggle to get through this book.  I have always thought Lee Child's books have had too much long drawn out descriptions, but this was was the worst.  It may be awhile before I ever purchase one of his books again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not quite as interestting as the first two books, but still a good read.  Maybe too much of a good thing is not a good thing.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|It takes some time to get the game set up and to read and comprehend the instructions, but after that the game is fun to play. It will take a lot of playing to understand and figure out a winning strategy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book  was an enjoyable read.  It took off where the first book left off.  I would not recomend it if you have not read the first book so you know the charactors are.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|Ok for anyone to say that this movie is or was terrible is a complete idiot!!! The acting was great, Effects were stellar and the battle scenes and landscapes breathtaking!! I've seen all of the LOTR movies and read The Hobbit and the LOTR Books and they were spot on making the movies, yes in the Hobbit it's split up into 3 parts (maybe not necessary) But as a fan of the LOTR I would rather see 3 Hobbit part movies instead of one. Why? because I as im sure alot of other LOTR fans were upset when you knew it all ended in The Return of the King but now you have 3 Hobbit movies to look forward to!!! Also you have the chance if Peter Jackson film and makes it this way you have a chance to have engaging thrilling and deep character's you can use making for the next 2 installations in the Hobbit, ( Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again ) and to have a trilogy you can just wait and look forward to What comes next!!!! Overall a terrific  movie for LOTR fans and for all!!!!!!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been playing this game for years.  It is fast paced, easy to learn and yet challenging to play.  I never tire of playing it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven: this book was amazing and kept me wanting to read more. It kept me intrigued. I love it.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|No proof - only the ramblings of a dream sequence told after he was awakened from a coma. Even though he had no brain activity there is no proof the dream sequence didn't happen once he began to wake. In any case I got halfway through and gave up as it was the descriptions were strange and conclusions made no sense to me. Glad he survived though for his sake and his family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|one of the do far very addicting FUN to play.  would recognize.to kids and adults Just all round good game
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not much variation -- when having to &#34;reshuffle&#34;, the cards seem to appear in the same order as before!  Not a real favorite of mine.
0887081770|4.0|A fanciful look at a child's love of the moon. Note: Pages are sturdy but some are larger (fold-out) format and can tear if handled roughly by younger children.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|He's great! Music is great! I can't wait for his next album! I hope Idol does enough to help promote him. He really is a great muaician with a new, fresh sound .
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This App is just what I was looking for.  I can put put in any stock symbol and follow my stocks.  Not too complex!
1451696191|5.0|One of the best books i have ever read. you will not regret reading this. Something i've never read before. Charlie is an amazing character props. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys reading about the life of an extraordinary teen
B000J103PC|5.0|One of the most exciting movies of a publisher executive and her many slaves who wait on her every whims.  It reminds me of people I actually knew and worked for, but greatly respected for their business abilities and managerial talent.  Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway play predator and prey to the limits.  Superb acting and full of action.  I loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is no other series out there so descriptive, and mind riveting as this one. Suzanne Collins is detailed lyrical genius.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|a good utility and the quality is good. I am extremely happy buying it. it fits great on my Nikon 18-55 VR Lens
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I don't use this app often, but when I do it's never failed me (yet)! Comes in very handy for rough notes on Kindle, but not for in-depth note-taking (I can't type that quickly).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a terrific series with excellent acting and enough of a story to keep you interested for hours.  I have been watching episode after episode.  Masterpiece theatre and PBS know how to do something as great as this.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I liked the book 13 Reasons Why, it is an interesting book because its a story of someone listening to the tapes of the last few days of a girls life who committed suicide. In the book it shows what lead up to why she hated living with the people around and all the traumatic events she went through until she couldn't take it anymore, so she killed herself. In this book its not just the girls story it's the person who is listening and his side of what he thought was happening which makes this book interesting and fun to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes sad stories that seem like they could be real. I would rate this book a 8 out of 10, its exciting, interesting, but a little dull at some parts, I also wish there could have been a better ending, more exciting and I would have liked to see what Clay would have done or said to the other people on the tapes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Good characterization and plot.  Action and suspense packed; you've done it again, Vince!  Thanks Glenn Beck for turning me on to Mr Flynn!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good story that moves along at a brisk pace. Lots of action, a bit of romance, and a pretty sadistic villain. The story provides us with a few twists and turns along the way. Worth the price of admission.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Can't find much use for it . . .  Not enough explanation on how to use it ...  Not user-friendly!
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, afterall, Johnny Depp is in it.  Unfortunately the movie often dragged and had little to no plot.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After viewing the musical movie production of Les Miserables, I was motivated to read the book.  I hadn't read it since high school -- a lifetime ago.  This is a story of humanity and redemption.  This is a story of personal struggle.  I am grateful to be revisiting literature that helps the reader journey into such worthwhile territory.  Thank you for making this classic available for free in a Kindle edition.
B002GOAH1U|5.0|For those of us who were raised on the All That and Amanda show, this is Amanda Bynes at her best.
B004H4XDBI|3.0|The book started off very slow but did eventually pick up pace the last fourth of the book.  It took a while to get to get into but it was overall a good book.
0988262592|5.0|One of the best enterprise IT books I've read, and it captures some of the \\"real\\" issues burning at the center of enterprise IT teams.  The story explores the challenges and transitions of a slow moving and highly vulnerable traditional enterprise IT structure; into a highly adaptive and collaborative DevOps culture.  It's a great narrative about the IT professionals who struggle to build, and re-build, their careers in the chaotic and complex IT environments, defined decades ago.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it for cross-discipline IT enterprise leaders looking to re-evaluate IT organizational structures, legacy processes and outdated tool-chains.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Cause I  like diary of a wimpy kid  book s cause they are funny and that's why I got this book
B002APU580|5.0|Although it's been around for a while now, Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen is the best version of this Jane Austen classic that has ever been filmed. Donald Sutherland is amazing as Mr. Bennit, as well as the rest of the cast playing their perspective characters. But the energy between Knightely and Macfadyen is one of silver screen legends. I continue to purchase this DVD to give as gifts to anyone I know who hasn't seen it and it never fails to please. Watch it once and soon you will hear yourself saying under your breath...&#34;Mrs. Darcy, Mrs. Darcy, Mrs. Darcy...Mrs. Darcy!!!
B000JQUMPI|4.0|This is a beautiful classic. If you want adventure, this may not be the thing, but if you like a classic with a great plot and unique characters, these are your women.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much because the storyline was so different than a lot of these high school romances. You won't expect the story to go to turn out to be what it is! Good have ended better though
B002N44XSG|5.0|There's a lot of off-books and side stories I've read, and none of them are like these. It's like you're reading another Percy Jackson book, with a lot of different stories (I think 4?) as well as a sneak leap to The Last Olympian if you haven't read it, puzzles, god and main character info, and other extras. It is so worth the price! A wonderful book that will keep you satisfied until you can get a hold of the other books (and series) which I recommend you do, because they are awesome.
B0009A40ES|3.0|The only thing I didn't like was all the discribing of the clothes all the characters were wearing. After a few chapters it got boring and I started to skip over the parts nameing the designers and type of clothes. I have the movie ,I hope its better.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This CD came in quickly and was well packaged.  The CD was still in original cellophane and was not damaged or scratched.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|Saw the PBS presentation and knew the video would make a great Christmas gift for my nephew, who is an awesome musician/guitarist, himself.  I almost decided to keep it for myself, since the classic songs Paul chose, from the American Songbook, were songs he recalled and loved from his childhood.  Many of you will remember them, too, as they are the tunes that stay in your head and you find that you remember ALL the lyrics, even after all these years.  Paul also includes his new song, &#34;My Valentine&#34;, accompanied by the great Joe Walsh (James Gang and Eagles) on guitar.  Paul's wonderful running commentary, along with interviews with the likes of Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Diana Krall and the show's producer, Tony LiPuma and others, add much to the presentation.  I guarantee that you'll be singing along, as you take this delightful walk down memory lane.  I know, I did.
0451232852|5.0|Haven't had time to read it yet but can't wait...just haven't had the time yet..this is a busy time of year
0143036424|5.0|The stories about a modern day sheriff in Wyoming are excellent.  Querky characters that you fall in love with.  Keep them coming, Craig.
B00821OUT6|1.0|this shows idea of a national guard unit is a couple of kids riding dirt bikes wielding assault rifles so there that's how unrealistic and just plain bad this show is. stay away at all costs
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Great series; great season; great episode!  I think that there is something in this show for everyone; perhaps excluding young children.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game was lots of fun for my grandson who loves my kindle!  I downloaded games that I thought would be age appropriate and this one was.
B0091REZMW|4.0|nice app to have fun and spend time. good for kids and grown up people too. download and enjoy.  good!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It works the way you would expect it to.  I like being able to set music to it as well.
B001FB5634|1.0|This movie is apocalyptic.......and makes you wish you were there, at the end of the world with no electricity so you wouldn't be stuck watching this move which goes on like a blister in the sun.
B008I43DYU|5.0|love it it is easy to use with the kindle fire. nice big ease. I use it to pay my bills. I like better than a regular calculator
B001N18HMS|5.0|I've been wanting this album on vinyl for a long time now. I'm glad to have such a beautiful masterpiece, a true work of art, on such an awesome format. Exactly what I was looking for!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Movie dragged a bit, overall it was ok.  i would recommend to watch though, just save it for a weekday.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|not the greatest. could be a lot better. did the author just write this for the sex? it clearly shows how poor a writer she is, and it is not good. it was alright in the begining, but later i just got tired of all the repeated sex. where is this story going? i have not read the other books, but i am not reading the others.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|I've had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for about 5 weeks. This was my first tablet device of any kind, and I've never used a smart phone, so everything was new to me (great fun for me). From day one I was surprised that the only way to copy files to and from my networked WiFi Kindle was with a USB cable. Then I discovered WiFi File Explorer Pro. WFFEP running on the Kindle turns it into a web server. Entering the Kindle's URL into Internet Explorer on my PC gives me access to the entire Kindle file structure, letting me manage my files without a cable connection between the PC and Kindle. Great.  My only problem was that I couldn't login to my Kindle when I set a password on WiFi File Explorer Pro. Then I realized it's because I always run IE with all cookies blocked. Apparently WFFEP sets a cookie when you enter the password on the login page in IE. Unfortunately, WFFEP doesn't warn you when you have cookies blocked. It just redisplays the login screen and leaves you mystified. Adding my Kindle's URL to the list of allowed sites in IE's Tools/Internet Options/Privacy tab fixed my problem.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys style of music is just what I like! It's energizing but not annoying. I love to use their music in my child care.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game!!! Wondering when the next one will be available??  Waiting anxiously for the sequel!!!! Fingers crossed and breath held.
1430308001|5.0|Before I purchased this book, I reviewed through the author website.  Then, I realized that it is very good to have this book for  my reference.  This book will be good for someone who is seriously wants to learn about chess strategies. However, it contains only 2 tactics; Fork and Discovered Check. Each tactics has plenty of illustrations with pieces on the chess board. The author did a very good job in explaining in plain English and provided some thoughts why or why not we should make particular moves.  I wish I could find this book in used version. However, I did not regret that I bought it.
0345803485|2.0|Your post: Jan 14, 2013 5:44:07 PM PST<br />T. Simmons says:<br /> I had heard so much about this book. I went out and purchase the Trilogy so I could move from one book to the other with no waiting. Well upon reading the first book I thought it was a little over the top, but I hung in there. Got to the second book and OMG it wasnt that much better. It was so irritable the way she kept repeating the same phrases over and over..holy S holy F...I found myself skipping over whole sentences to avoid some of her empty phrases. Finally when the deranged exgirlfriend entered the story I perked up and said to myself..FINALLY! Something...but that was quickly over with..that part of the story went obsolutely NOWHERE! I struggled so hard to get through that second book. I would put it down far days before picking it up again. Finally I got to the third book. When I got to page 58...I was so bored with it all that I just jumped to the middle...Big Mistake! More Irritating Phrases...Blip or was it Blimp...who knows but what woman keep referring to her unborn child as a Blip? So I just jumped to the last two pages and put myself out of that misery. I am a reader, I have so many novels that I'm running out of places to keep them neatly...Never! have I given any of my books away because after a year or two I can go back and read them with just as much enjoyment as I had the first time I read them. But The 50 Shades of Gray trilogy..I gave away to someone who only had the first edition. I Hated those books. In my opinion the writing was poorly done. I got no enjoyment out of reading these books at all. Will NEVER BUY another book written by this author. The only way I would even read another book by her is if a friend had it and didnt mind loaning it.<br /><br />On the plus side. At the end of book three there was a prologue. The prologue was written from Christian Grey point of view of the first moment he met Anastasia. I think the author should have written the whole book from Christian point of view..It was the best part of the book.<br /><br />Somewhere I read some sort of comparison between 50 Shades and the Twilight series...No Way! I read the Twilight series and couldn't put it down. Also I read where there is some interest in making a movie on the Fifty Shades trilogy. Its been my experience (from reading a book, and then watching the movie) that the book was always better. But in the case of \\"Fifty Shades\\" the movie could only be better!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|ifhis sidhshdhj dhdshxishifhahxhjx dhjzhduzgfihhxsdhdusddsgdsfushjd bdjshdus xhz xahd shduusxugsu xsgd hdsjx wbxbzxhsu xw just look at the title man....it really does blow bad
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was a delight to read. It had such adventure and magic and romance, things that make a book great in my opinion. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great adventure!! It definitely leaves you wanting more and I can't wait to start on the 2nd book!
B002V9L5IE|5.0|I first heard Asif Avidan on you tube and immediately was drawn to his style of music.<br /><br />You can hear a little bit of everything as influence in his music.<br /><br />I was a little leary on ordering from Israel, as it did take over 3 weeks to get.  However, the package arrived safely and the seller was very professional.<br /><br />If you are looking for something a little different, but sounds very familiar, I would highly recommend this CD.  Highly enjoyable!
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|Plays a LOT of video and audio files, which is exactly what I need on my Kindle Fire HD, but it's not the prettiest interface, playback can be jittery on Hardware Encoding (not sure what that means though) and it refused to play a few random files. Still, for the most part, from a free app, it works well.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Excellent show - purchased through amazon because I could not &#34;catch up&#34; on via Comcast Cable.<br />Waiting for Season 5 to start.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I love Darren Aronofsky and this movie is great. My wife loved it as well. Darren's ability to pull you in and make you feel what they are feeling is why I watch his movies. Also check out Requiem for a Dream and Pi.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This one is right up there with Who's Next, London Calling, Exile on Main Street, Every Picture Tells a Story, Never mind The Bollocks, OK Computer & What's the Story Morning Glory as amoung the very best British Pop/rock records ever made.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Way different angle than Season 1 but I've been hooked since the first episode. Stay with it if you loved S1 and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I am a huge Frank Sinatra fan...and this is so close is scary!  It was so beautiful for Christmas Eve.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Very interesting.  Learned things I did not know about my President.  Will be reading his next books and whatever else he produces
1932735410|3.0|There is a lot of content in the book, which makes it somewhat hard to follow. Mainly used the book for the questions and that seemed to help my studying. I used in conjunction with Andy Crowe's book which was excellent as well as the simulation software. After months of studying with the 3 materials I passed the PMP!
B003EYVXT6|5.0|The movie Splice came on time and is a good movie for any one that likes Sci-Fi movies if you think you want to see the movie Splice you should see the movie Splice.
B008CX2A2I|2.0|This bluetooth dongle works well most of the time. The sound is much better than say a logitech bluetooth adapter. The biggest problem with this unit is that it doesn't allow you to watch a different source, while a bluetooth device is connected. Many of us want to watch a game, but play music instead of listening to the broadcast. This unit will not allow you to do it. Instead it will put some bogus paired connection screen on your tv. This all assumes you have hdmi video routed through this receiver. Really I am not pleased about this.<br /><br />Also it does not pair with the Galaxy S3. Major fail.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|These games are 11 and 7 years old. We have come a long way in interface and playability in those years. If you know going in that these are a bit dated, you'll enjoy them much more.<br /><br />I consider both of these games incredibly important to the medium as an art form. They do something that few other games attempt to do: make the player feel something through the game mechanics. As such, it was important to me to own these so I can point out to friends what I'm talking about when I nerd out over the meaning of art in electronic media.<br /><br />The downside is that there really isn't much more than what is promised on the box. If you've played Ico and SotC before, these are the same games. They're HD-upgraded and play much more smoothly on the PS3 than they did on last gen hardware. For JP and NA region players, you get the extra content originally only in the EU release of Ico; including the 2 player mode!<br /><br />It's totally worth it to me, but make sure you can appreciate these games for what they are and when they were released. If so, then it's a worthwhile investment.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is everything I hoped for and more!!!! I was hooked after the first two minutes, so much so, that I watched the first season in one day!!! Love the show and the amazing acting!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING FROM THE START TO THE FINISH.  it was awesome how the author waited till the end to make the whole story fall into place the way it did and I would have never guessed the end!  My family is however happy to have me back after 2 days of being sucked into this book.
B009E3EY38|3.0|I bought this particular package of Celebration Day because it has not only a Blu-Ray disc, but also a regular DVD and the concert on audio CD.  Unfortunately, the DVD is not the actual concert, but bonus material.  Which is great and everything, but I thought the DVD was simply a DVD of the concert.  I don't yet have a Blu-Ray player, hence my disappointment.<br /><br />Not THAT big of a deal - I intend to buy a Blu-Ray player anyway.  I just think the item could have used a better description.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved this game and the one where the daughter gets kidnapped by the ghost pirates! And this series! Keep it up!
B00006AFF5|5.0|Great movie for x-mas time. Perfect for the entire family to watch. Anyhting with Jim Carrey is always a good movie
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This reader works great and has lasted for over 6 months, which my elago Mobile Nano II did not.  Plus this reader is smaller, needs no cap, has no moving eject button and is cheaper!  Better all around.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|Have read the books and enjoyed the film - watched with the while family. We are hooked and looking forward to next movie in sequence.
0316113077|4.0|I really love that book. its a great for somebody like me who is beginer baker and decorator :) it shows techniques, supplies etc.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful family movie. No worries about innuendos that may need further explanation after the movie. Made for the children, but I like it too!
0618918248|5.0|Loved every chapeter! Coherent. Bold. All arguments backed. I recomend this book for those who seek the truth. Truly a magnificent piece of work! reat job mister Dawkins!!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Having come from the generation of the original &#34;Alien&#34; this movie often brought the &#34;Oh it's just a remake! Where is Sigourney at?&#34; remarks. However, the ending brought the twist that cleverly tied it all together and caused the viewer to ponder the theory presented.<br />Very clever!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Cannot wait to see the movie - and I feel the stars will be a perfect fit for the books characters!
B00005A0BC|5.0|Fantastic album for anyones vinyl collection. Otis Redding was a fantastic singer taken way too early in life. There was much more we couldve heard from him.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|A real adventure that you can watch over several times. You will need to if you really want to know what is going on as there are so many characters.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Great single from Coldplay , one of there best songs and it was free so that is always a plus this will be great for those nice long road trips playing it in the car.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I purchased this for my son's girlfriend for cmas.  She loves the movie and wanted to own it.  I have it in my DVD library and agree that it is a fun, feel-good movie.<br />DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I couldn't be happier!  Well, maybe if you were giving them away... haha.  But the price was right, so it's all good.
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids put it on my kindle and now I hardly get to use it for myself....  :) Sadly I may need to delete it just so I can use my Kindle again.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app has been so helpful. My husband is a self employed plumber with a backhoe. This app has really come in handy for the digging jobs he has acquired. Rain being a huge issue in this business, this app has definietly helped with his schedule.
0988262592|5.0|Chances are you've worked somewhere as dysfunctional as Parts Unlimited, stuck in an IT scenario where you're undervalued and over committed.  Perhaps you've even been in Bill's position, suddenly promoted when results aren't matching expectations and you're expected to right the ship.  How would you go about it?  Studying top performers will get you so far, but IT as an industry is only a few decades old.  What if we're all doing it wrong, or at least there is a better way that we don't need to come up with on our own?  As it turns out, there is.<br /><br />We can learn a lot by turning to other industries that have faced and overcome similar challenges to what we see in the IT space.  In particular, the ideas of Deming, Goldratt and others have long shaped the quality and efficiency of modern manufacturing, much of which is directly applicable to us.  Understanding the types of work, managing work in progress and creating the necessary culture are all challenges we face in IT, all have solutions that we need to understand and are all touched on in the book.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It's quick read and  while I've heard many of these ideas before, I hadn't internalized them yet.  But reading Gene's book gave me a much better understanding of the core concepts developing under what we call DevOps.  Fiction lends itself extremely well to the delivery of these ideas by making them very approachable and putting everything in context.  If you care about improving the environment you're in now or where IT as an industry is headed, read this book.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I spend way too much time on this game. I haven't beat it yet, but I certainly keep trying. Love it!!!
B000FCKC4C|2.0|This book was not up to standard.  Boring.<br />It drags on and on. The ending is not satidfying.<br />Most books on Amazon are rated 4 or 5.<br />It makes me wonder.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Christian Bale's Batman. Domination. Justice. America. Morgan Freeman. Michael Cane. These are the words that win this movie over. Batman.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Consider Judge Dredd in the 90's a comedy, consider this a bad a$$ man that just wants to dole out justice. If you like blood, and action, and a little gore check it out!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|One of the great trilogies of the last century. There's a fourth movie too but its awful. Three more words are required to finish this review..
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It is a fast, easy read and part of the entire trilogy.  It is not the best book I've ever read, but it's catchy.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I was looking for a case that was simple and would do the job. My two year old can hold it with no problem. The price was reasonable unlike others. Our kindle fits great in the case.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This movie has been around for a while, so it's nothing new.  The blue ray version is great. Pleased with purchase.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|kids love it and it's addictive. My granddaughter is 6 and she just loves this game. I like it too.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This version of UNO is GREAT for road trips!!  You can pass your tablet/smartphone around the car and play for hours!!  It has great options for single person play, as well.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book is one that the once you start. it's hard to put it down.  I have read several other Tom Clancy books and this book is keeping up with is excellent style of writing.  Looking forward to his next adventure..
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Family has 2 authentic LifeProof cases was hoping to save a little @ holidays on purchasing another 1 as a gift for myself...WRONG! You get what you pay for! Dots on screen hard to see, WORSE is the screen has ripples so VERY hard to click on the screen because doesn't make proper contact...unable to warranty due to FAKE & based on other reviews seller is not reputable! VERY DISAPPOINTED HAPPENS ON AMAZON!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|When this event occurred there was so many opinions from the news media and talk shows that the average citizen got really confused as to what really happened.  This book, written a man who participated in the raid really gave me a true idea of what really happened.  Would recommend this to anyone interested in really what happened.  Looking forward to seeing the movie based on this book.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|I mean it's not maybe an all time classic but this film is so good for so many different reasons. Exploring love in a new and exciting way, the way some might imagine an impossible love story might have been written.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|This case is not lifeproof I got it for my 12 year old daughter as a Christmas present and she broke it within 2 days!!! I thought I could return it but nope Amazon is not an authorized seller!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is very much like 50 shades of gray but better. The author's writing skill is more mature and there is less of the annoying repitition. The sex scenes are sooo hot and spicy! Gideon is an alpha male god. Rich, controlling and oh so handsome. Ava tries to fight his advances at every turn but is no match for his raw sex appeal. There are several antagonists in this book that bring page turning drama that keeps you up at night. You will not be dissapointed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My children love this game, they like all the angry bird apps, but this by far is there favorite. This is a game for all ages, I play from time to time myself.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The continuation of Gideon's and Ava's journey is just as profound as the beginning. The author delves more into Ava's tragic past and when a dangerous reminder comes back, Gideon does his best to protect Ava while confusing her about his feelings for her. I read this book in one day and am consumed in finding similar books to fill the gap until \\"Entwined with you\\" comes out. May is too far!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I take most all of my pictures with my Kindle and they are great quality. I get a lot of comments how well the quality is.
B003QI95Y0|5.0|This cd is amazing and I continue to keep it in my cd player and loaded on my ipad. I love this band. They continue to stay true to their roots.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My children love this app, the kids interact with the cat. You can feed the cat milk, it purrs when petted, you can hit it on the head, and it falls over. The cat listens and mimics what you say, my children think it is hilarious.
B00846REIS|4.0|Bared to You is pretty similar to 50 Shades, but it still has it's own unique twists. I've read it twice now, and it's just as good the second time! I would definitely recommend this book to everyone!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Game is all time favorite. However I would like to see updates that make it more like the pc or xbox versions. Then it'd get five stars
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was definitely not what I expected. Great book, twisted, but great. Gillian Flynn does a great job at keeping you guessing.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Not well written in my opinion..I cant understand the HYPE about this book..Over rated..She's deffinately lost her senses.No woman should be treated like that........
0920668364|4.0|Enjoy reading the book to my grandsons. Must admit I skip the part when the little boy flushes his mothers watch down the toilet. Don't want to give them any ideas. Hehe
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game and i only had it for 5 min. You need to get this. When I get bored I'll play this game there's so many levels
B0068FYZMK|5.0|Babe is a great movie for kids and adults!  It's one of those movies that kids can watch over and over again and their parents don't get too sick of it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is awesomeness. I play for hours. Don't listen to the  bad reviews. It's great I love it so get it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very addicting game... but I love it! Lots of fun easy for kids to play with. The kids I babysit love this game!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This show is the reason I signed up for instant video. I love how I can watch the episodes I got over and over again too. It's great because Netflix only has the first season and Hulu doesn't have it at all so I was able to catch up on the second season on amazon instant video so that I could start watching it live on tv when it airs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love love love it I really think this game is one of the best.  :) thank you whoever created this game
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a cute app and also lots of fun.  You draw your own stickman and he/she comes to life and goes on an adventure.  Even if you can't draw......you win.  LOL
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read...a<br />Just as good if not better than the first..can't wait to read read the last one...I recommend it to all
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After you see the movie read the book - it is even better! The author explores the psychology of Valjean's renaissance as an honest man
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game can't wait for the new levels !!!!!! Can't beat the fun of this FREE app. Easy and enjoyable- great for all ages.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I rented this on a whim, not having heard anything about the movie. What a fabulous surprise. The film is a gem in its unique quirkiness. You wonder, who came up with this story? You find yourself getting really invested in the various (all interesting) characters. Every single person in the movie is portrayed perfectly by their respective actors.<br /><br />In particular, I loved the art direction and photography, both of which sustain a 60's feel throughout the entire film. It was a delight to watch. My personal favorite was Tilda Swinton as Social Services. What a riot.<br /><br />If you like movies that are not predictable and take you on a ride you may not expect, watch Moonrise Kingdom.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read quite a few books in my time, and this one has to be one of my favorites!!! Very easy to read and it only took me 2 days to read it!! Very highly recommended!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Book is good...not great. Would recommend it to friends but thought it was missing a lot! Thought it would have been better after reviews!
B007V65R54|5.0|This would make a GREAT primer for &#34;how to think clearly and communicate clearly.&#34;  It is within the intellectual grasp of anyone with even middle-school reading comprehension and mathematical skills.
0765325950|1.0|Like others, I logged onto Amazon ready to buy this book and begin reading on my Kindle, where the rest of my collection is (donated hardcovers and paperbacks to charity long ago). With no ebook being released, I couldn't buy the book in good conscious. I read my friends copy over the weekend to make sure my money doesn't support this horrid scheme to increase hardcover sales. I would have gladly paid more for the ebook. Instead, the publisher gets nothing from me but bad press. If Harriet was some naive lady, I might have some respect, but no, she's an editor and has thorough knowledge of publishing. Shame on you.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun and entertaining with lots of small puzzles to solve along the way.Good graphics and it actually has a story line.
0547884591|5.0|I like so much that I gift it to friends. While it is not for everyone, it teaches how to master the art of living.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There's no right answer, you have to choose the best of the wrongs. That's what I took away from this book. The book itself tells you this, that there is no rosy answer to the situation this book puts before you.<br />This book will make you think, feel for the characters, and contemplate what you would do in their shoes.<br />When I started this book, I almost wanted to put it down, thinking it was just another story about teenage love life. I really get frustrated with those stories, so I don't read them. I stuck this one out, because of it's Best Seller rating, and so glad I did.<br />There is a complex mystery in this story, that works itself through these kids emotions, and leaves you turning page after page to get close to their answer. You think about what you would do under the circumstances they have been thrown in to.<br />All and all, it is a very possible and thought provoking book.
B009NCM248|5.0|Huge fan of Corey Taylor and all of his work with both slip knot and stone sour. This album does not disappoint at all. Everything you would expect from stone sour maybe even a bit heavier then past albums. 5stars.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|not working correctly. doesn't load older posts, and it doesn't seem to load images. facebook from the browser works better.  please fix!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun and easy for all ages.  My four year old as well as myself plays it and gets a challenge from it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story. Didn't see the the twist coming.<br />Can't wait to read the last book and find out how it all ends.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|really like they way you can have different books and the accessories that come with it. i like how i can email myself the books
0385341679|5.0|I love Karen Marie Moning, this series is one of the best I've ever read.  Looking forward to it being made into a movie.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|The product is great.  We have shown it to freinds and family.  The quality is great and the content is awesome.  It also arrived before I expected it which is a bonus.
B000687M48|4.0|I did not know this was a concert album, silly me! But it was great and I enjoyed the music videos and the band being goofy behind the set.
B0096I9UTE|4.0|Kylie Minogue takes 15 of her hits songs and puts them against a lovely orchestral backing the results are more than stunning.  The album also includes the new song Flower which was originally recorded for the X sessions but wasn't included on the album. The album highlights are 'On A Night Like This'  'Locomotion' , 'Confide in Me', 'I Should Be So Lucky' , 'Can't Get You Out of My Head', & of course 'Flower'. In the case of both the Locomotion and Can't Get You Out Of My Head the orchestral backing greatly improves the songs from their original incarnations. Some of the downside to this album ae that both All the Lovers and Where the Roses Grow fall extremely short on this project; in the case of Lovers it's just a completed and utter failure and as for Roses it sounds way to close to the original. Also another negative is that nothing from Impossible Princess (whose songs would have be great here) and X (unless you live in Japan or Australia) were included on this album and those songs would have greatly benefitted from a new life as their trip hop/techno and electronic arrangements where turned orchestral. Overall good effort and a great vocal display from Ms. Minogue.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I became an Angry Birds addict last year when I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas, so when I heard about &#34;SPACE&#34; I was excited, but this game just doesn't do it for me.....
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bad ass movies in a bad ass set. What more can I ask for? Maybe just wish Heath could have come back :(
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVEIT!  My husband and I are both hooked......we are trying all the &#34;jewels&#34; that we can find.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interestion book.  A lot of thought went into, which I appreciate.  It kept me on edge for the first half.  It really kept me wondering what would be the outcome.  But then the book changed and I did not like the second half as well.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is a really fun game!! I am seriously addicted to it and i think you should get it.  You can play with your friends and new people too. I play pet shop story and i think this game is a little better because you can send gold(which you need for some things) for free! Also,  you can buy dragons for the coins that you earn and can evolve them with the food you can grow. if you evolve them, they get bigger. This is a really fun game and if you like animals and taking care of things, you will like this game. Also pet shop story, and horse life adventures.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|I had this movie in VCR format and wanted to replace it with the latest media in BluRay. A great, suspenseful movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Game has a great story, challenging puzzles and keeps you guessing how it will end.  Hope to see more games like this soon.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I purchased this book on a recommendation from Bill O'Reilly. I was not disappointed. Flynn is a good writer and presented a very intriguing plot line.
B004UID2LC|2.0|It would be ok if I could search for what I like. But just gives options of most popular and recent videos. Just not for me.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great book from Nicholas Sparks.  This was a great easy read after a very busy holiday season! Looking forward to the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book! I just didn't want to put it down.  Not a dull moment in throughout the entire book. Love!
B000059TEQ|5.0|This movie is timeless! Even my teenage daughter watched it with me!  I love having it available at anytime to curl up on the couch during a rainy day!
B000BI0WOA|5.0|This is one of my favorite easy listening music cd's, i can't stand poorly recorded music, this cd is wonderfully done.  I would highly recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site!  I have made so many wonderful recipes that I found from Pinterest!  Great gift ideas!  This is the best site to get lost for hours!!
1451627297|4.0|Interesting tale about a diner that contains a portal to 1958.  Our hero goes back to try and prevent the assassination of JFK, and after several starts and stops, finally succeeds, with disastrous results.  Good read, lots of historical references to Lee Oswald and his family, lots of plot twists to keep it interesting.  Long book, over 700 pages.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I ordered this for my 12 year old grandson as a Christmas present;  I also bought him the original Men In Black as well.  Men in Black III is the only one of the series that he had seen, so I thought he would enjoy watching the other two series of the three.  I was very surprised that the movie arrived in just a couple of days after ordering.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|My husband saw this movie years ago and were very impressed.  We both love dancing and musicals and this was one of our favorites.  Both dancers are marvelous.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|Challenging.  Have to think outside the box.  Some levels are easier than others, but it is a brain teaser.  Good.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I loved the movie. I loved Harrison Ford's character and his transformation. In the humor it has an endearing message about what is really important: people.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I like Pac-Man, but not this version.  The lite is in one place and the pac-man in another.  Confusing.  Sorry I downloaded it.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|five stars for fantastic this is one of the best albums of the 70's that I did not buy!<br />Buy it ! Listen to it ! tell others! this album is great I cannot stop listening to it!
B003V6L94Q|4.0|It was fine, just as a new item should be.  It says I need ten more words to sumit, ??? what sense does that make ???  oh well I guess thats enough
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|The best gift for a lifetime gamer. My husband loved it. I love that monopoly makes their games in so many themes. Also, super fast delivery.
0345803507|5.0|it is not the best book for a well read person but if you want to see if you can get excited  this is the book for you
076781214X|1.0|So good old megacorporation Columbia has decided to release this nice little film in an abridged pan and scan edition. I guess I shouldn't and couldn't expect more from a bunch of green in their eyes suits who probably only read War and Peace in its abridged form in one of those bathroom books.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|First book in a long time that I have started to read for personal pleasure. The book is written well and still has it's grips on me!
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Always did like this movie as it brings back fond memories of when I was in high school and the good times we had..
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game. Enjoy the puzzles and the graphics. The fact that its free is another plus. Not many games that are entertaining offer all its content but this one does.
1449415881|5.0|Makes my day everyday! 16 words are required so here they are.OK need eight more words to allow me to rate your product? Hmm...
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got survival craft demo a.k.a. a rip-off of minecraft, then a friend told me that minecraft pocket edition was better. I desided to give it a try and loved it I cant stop playing it. it was so worth the 7 dollars! I highly enjoy this app! best game in the world! and I'm not a minecraft nerd but you should try it!
1608871517|5.0|WOW ~ I was just blown away with the quality of this book! I could not put it down and finished it in 3 days. High quality book with gorgeous pictures. It was fun to learn more about the creative process behind MJ's outfits. Highly recommended!
0786852550|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this story. Stroud is a genius, an excellent writer, a brilliant storyteller, and a master of the YA/fantasy genre.<br /><br />Take one healthy dose of a young male protagonist with angst and power issues, add an overbearing male father figure and doting but stern mother figure, a few ancillary supporting \\"family members\\" and you've got Nathaniel's upbringing as a young magician in an alternate history London.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about the story is that Stroud writes from two perspectives. We've got Nathaniel, in 3rd POV, but also Bartimaeus, in 1st POV.<br /><br />Bartimaeus is the djinni summoned to Nathaniel's side. Their adventure takes them into life-threatening situations, mysterious neighborhoods, secret meetings of cabal-like magicians, and a host of other scenes, all of which are memorable. Not one chapter of this story could be left out and have the story still work. Even the minimally described \\"resistance\\" and the characters that populate it. We don't get enough of them, perhaps, but as #1 of a trilogy, it's expected that we'll see more in book 2.<br /><br />Stroud does a fantastic job of describing the magical rituals Nathaniel undertakes on his quest of vengeance for, appropriately enough, being treated poorly (he gets a spanking) by another magician. The hierarchy of magic users that Stroud sets up leaves no question about what Nathaniel is setting himself up for, and yet, as we'd expect, he's oblivious for a good bit of the story.<br /><br />Thankfully, we have Bartimaeus narrating for us, and the 1st POV chapters are an absolute joy to read. His footnotes are some of the best parts of the story, too. Fans of Sir Terry Pratchett will enjoy them, for sure. Fans of Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy series might also like these stories.<br /><br />The djinni is snarky, a bit of a jerk at times, and yet perfectly sensible. It's next to impossible to empathize with the magicians as a result. We can sympathize with them, but I certainly wanted Bartimaeus to come out unscathed far more than any of the busybodies mucking about with pentagrams, summoner's incense, and candles.<br /><br />The story sets things up beautifully for book 2, leaving only one minor plot thread unanswered. But that's enough to keep readers' attention and interest. If you like YA fantasy, magic, history, and punchy dialogue with an almost noir-like feel, read this book.[[ASIN:B00464A4QG Amulet of Samarkand]] -- I scored a hardcover, with jacket, at the local charity shop for $1. Go hunting, as this book is a few years old now.ith them, but I certainly wanted Bartimaeus to come out unscathed far more than any of the busybodies mucking about with pentagrams, summoner's incense, and candles.<br /><br />The story sets things up beautifully for book 2, leaving only one minor plot thread unanswered.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book.  It was heartwrenching and funny all in one.  An honest portrayal of the growing pains of youth in many forms.
1452111014|5.0|Fantastic book! Great for those interested in art and animation behind the scenes detail and the whole approach to a great film!
034580404X|2.0|This was a nice price for the set of books, however the series is not well written and definitely was not worth all the hype.  Plenty of not mainstream sex but the supposed heroine's mentality leaves something to be desired.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I love Matt Damon in all the Bourne Trilogy films, you can't beat it.  Can watch all the series over and over again and never get bored!!
B00006AW2F|4.0|Well, whether they approved it or not is not really the point. I have almost every release this group has ever put out (that matter). But this has to be the strangest Rolling Stones album I have. Its very good but it almost doesnt sound like the same group. I think its very very good and must for any hard corp stones fan, but its definately a strange one....
0765325950|1.0|pretty pathetic that they are trying to force hardback editions on everyone it is the year 2013, ebook versions should always be available for such popular releases. being a long time fan of this series i had planned on buying both the ebook version for actually reading and the hardback version for the bookshelf, that wont be happening now until i can buy it used.
0802473156|5.0|This is a MUST have book.  It's a great reading book for relationships.  I purchased another one as well.  I highly recommend this book.  Easy to read.
B0063GORYU|4.0|the regular solitaire game wasn't challenging enough, however spider with 2 suits I have only won once out of about 10 games so far
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Very enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch.  We had three generations watching and all enjoyed it. Very nice colors with a nice storyline.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Oh my gosh souch a good book really funny . Loved this book .<br />So I give it a 5 star.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love Mahjong!<br />Tired?  Sit down, relax and play Mahjong.  I have several other versions and hope this one will be as much fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Clever and thoroughly engrossing.  Great television show. The best of Britain with terrific acting and a plot interwoven with history, superb performances by an all star cast
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am hungry for more! Very detailed ending, kept me on my toes. Katniss is a perfect representation of a mockingjay.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I downloaded this app and used the free puzzles that you can download and they all played great. Immediately after purchasing the some puzzles for it, it quit working. Don't waste any of your money and stay with the free puzzles for it.<br /><br />As a follow up they changed the format of the puzzle pieces which made it totally annoying. Still a waste of time and money.
0307887448|4.0|This book was awesome! Normally I would never read this type of book (sci-fi) but after reading a review in a magazine I decided to order it.  I bought three copies total.  My kids, sister, brother-inlaw, and couple friends all agree.  If you remember the eighties and the video games from the 80's-90's you will find this book alot of fun to read.  I also rented the audio version to listen to and found it even better.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the freedom of reading my kindle content on my tablets and computers. Would suggest they add the ability to make collections on the tablet app.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The show is awesome. Impeccable acting. Save yourself some money and subscribe to SHO for one month and you can stream both seasons.
B009IF82SK|5.0|The situations the characters go through are funny and believable. I laugh through the show on every episode. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good sitcom.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Was recieved well before the expected date, and was like new. Great season and the episodes are great. Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great plot and characters.  It was nice to see references to Derry again.  It was just good old fashioned King.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This i3 is really good.  Great graphics, no need for graphics card unless you are a hardcore gamer or do 3d rendering.  Super fast.  Runs cool (25 degrees C).  The first package I ordered from Amazon had this item and some other computer stuff $370 total.  Amazon and UPS were showing the package delivered but I had not received it.  Most likely delivered to the wrong address by UPS.  I called Amazon and they replaced it all and put overnight shipping on it for no charge.  Thank you Amazon.  Amazon is awsome!
B009DT424Y|4.0|As a previous comment stated, this product does not work with iPhone or iPad.  You need to purchase the RX Model.<br /><br />I contacted Customer Service after I tried the steps in the previous review and within 24hrs they had sent out a new microphone that does support iPads WITHOUT me sending back my old one UNTIL I had verified that it worked.  I am simply delighted with this customer service and the microphone.  It works perfectly with ooVoo and SKYPE
0525457585|5.0|This was another attempt to get my picky reader to read a book! He enjoyed this movie so the book should be enjoyed as well, he has already pointed out the cool colored text!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The 10th Anniversary Concert recording includes Colm Wilkinson, the original Jean Valjean, and Michael Ball as Marius, as well as Phillip Quast as Javert. These are all strong voices and strong performances. I don't think there are any performances that I would classify as weak, unlike the 25th Anniversary cast, where Nick Jonas as Marius just doesn't have the vocal chops. I own the CD of the 10th and the DVD of the 25th. Alfie Boe, as Valjean in the 25th, will knock your socks off. But the audio recording of the 10th is phenomenal and a must for any Les Mis lover.
0582461464|5.0|My son is hard to get books for. I think he will love this classic that my father introduced to me at his age. I was thrilled the book came in time for his birthday even though his birthday is right after the holidays!
098555780X|5.0|This book is a great tutorial of some really great knots!! I am truly enjoying my purchase!! I would recomend this book toanyone interested in tying knots!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This box set is first rate.  The picture/audio quality on all of the films is great.  You also get a comprehensive set of extra features.  I got it for $20, which is a steal.
B009G3T01M|5.0|I have grown up on rap.  I like the beats and I like the rawness.  However, as a mother of three daughters and an aging fan, I don't respect or like much of mainstream rap that is over produced, sexist, and stupid.  Then walks in Macklemore and Lewis.  Hooking fans with songs like &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; and then keeping them with songs like &#34;Same Love&#34; or &#34;Starting Over&#34;.  It is obvious through the subjects of the songs that Macklemore is thoughtful, intelligent, and seasoned.  I started contemplating his age when he was dropping lines about Reaganomics and R. Kelley that many of my students would never catch.  He is almost 30, still quite young, but old enough to have some life experiences to guide and inspire his writing.  With Ryan Lewis working with him to drop hooks with haunting vocals, such as Evan Roman's in &#34;A Wake&#34; the combination provokes a feeling of nostalgia and hope.  It is rare that I buy an entire album with the option to buy the one or two songs that are good on a CD.  But I purchased this entire album and listen to it over and over again and I don't have to wait for my daughters to leave the car to do it.
B007MU85D0|4.0|Love the voices -- love the music.  I never skip a song -- B+ on the lyrics.  Never a fan of overly redundant choruses...
B0068FYZCA|4.0|I bought this movie because it had been years since I saw it and my son had never seen it. We enjoyed it. Quality wasn't great nor sound but what can you expect from an old movie.
0765325950|5.0|This book is a fantastic conclusion to the series.  From the very beginning to the end it had me in its grips, and I enjoyed every second of it.  It was action packed, with just the right amount of laughter and tears thrown in.  While I'm sure all readers have an idea of how the series would end overall, there was still so many surprises along the way that made my jaw drop.  From the first page to the last, this book never let me down.<br /><br />The ending.  Oh god the ending, and I'm not talking about the content (though it was awesome), I'm talking about the moment when I read those last word, and it hit me.  The series is over.  My god I have never felt so happy and sad at the same time.  I thought back to the moment I first picked up book 1, and how long it's been since.  I still can't believe its over, I almost wish I was still waiting for this book.
B008J05EL8|1.0|It is junk no fonts I'd use junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk junk crap

1449410243|3.0|I recently purchased this book as a gift for my mom, a fellow cat lover. Just briefly thumbing through it I found myself chuckling. At under $10 this book is a no brainer for any cat lover.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|as usual he can't write a bad book. a real page turner and alot of blending of history and personalities.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It charges my Kindle properly, but  gets hot to the touch very quickly.  I like that the plug folds down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very easy and user friendly.  I do not let a day go by without playing this game.  It is one of the better apps available.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Seen the movie and was intrigued to read the book. Glad I did! Read the entire book in just a couple days. Gonna go back and re watch the movie just to see the things in the book. Then diving right in to book 2.

B008K6HN8I|1.0|Got this trying to find a loop hole to getting adobe flash on my fiance's kindle fire 32 gig hd tablet....didn't work (for me at least). So I sent the kindle back, the 3 year warranty and also the pocket pro case I bought for my fiance for Christmas lol. Never making a big purchase like that for him again unless I know it's something he wants for sure. All that money for a tablet or iPad and you can't even get on Facebook games, which millions of people would probably like to do laying down on a bed versus sitting up to get on Facebook games on a laptop, you know? Oh well, at least I got my money back for the pricey product.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Simply the best. Buy it..Simply the Best. Buy this..I really don't know what else to say. Everyone that has seen the theater version owes it to themselves to buy this

0765325950|5.0|An awesome end to an awesome series. Without giving away any spoilers, I was very sad to see some characters die and happy to see some that lived that I didn't think would. I would have liked to get this in a Kindle version first, but the hardcover will be something I enjoy having as well.

B0065GC0BA|4.0|Jojo Moyes's books are easy read, but require some brain-usage, which I like.  I wasn't as torn up over these characters as many toher reveiwers seem to have been, but I enjoyed the book, and would definitely recommend it.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was okay. I loved the first and second books. This one was worth reading but I didn't love it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You can never tell a book by it's cover as many of the people found out in this book.  It was heart warming yet disturbing as I recalled how I might view  certain people who look different.  It challenged the reader to think before reacting.

030759565X|5.0|I love the Smitten Kitchen Cookbook.  I have not been a follower of the blog, but will now check it out based on my experience with this book.  The recipes are written by a self-titled \\"obsessive home cook\\" which means the recipes translate very well into reality.  Most of the ingredients are commonly-found and easy to obtain without being over the top.  This isn't a \\"too-fancy\\" for regular families cookbook; instead it provides interesting and creative recipes to challenge your normal routine.  The recipes are clear and with lovely photographs, which make your mouth water and encourage you to get cooking!  Highly recommend.

0765325950|2.0|Let me start out by stating that I think Brandon Sanderson is a great writer. I've read most of his published work, and I know he's capable and sophisticated. That's why I'm so disappointed in this book. Even the other WoT books he worked on were far superior to A Memory of Light.<br /><br />And let's face it, he gets a lot of credit for managing to pull this off at all. Robert Jordan had created a huge, tangled ball of interwoven plots and sub-plots over the course of the previous books. Managing to resolve all of those fully would be extremely difficult even under the best circumstances.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have the feeling that pressure to complete the series in just one final book, and possibly page count limitations as well, have led to a less than ideal resolution to the series. My overall opinion is that all of my issues with this book could have been resolved if Mr. Sanderson had been allowed to add a few hundred pages of additional material. And I think he would have managed it well. Regardless of where the fault lies, I'm saddened by the end result though.<br /><br />Below are my primary issues with the final installment in the series. Please be aware that there are major spoilers included and stop reading if you haven't pickup up the book yet.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT!!! ***<br /><br />*** I REALLY MEAN IT!!! ***<br /><br />1. Bao the Wyld, aka Demandred, is a very poorly implemented storyline. There's not enough detail to flesh out what he's been doing, his followers culture, or why they're really fighting for the Dark One. Less detail may have actually been more effective. As it is, there's just enough to get me interested, but no follow through.<br /><br />  The whole sub-plot around Bao/Demandred, his obsession with fighting Rand in a duel, and the three sword fights leading to his death feels arbitrary and incomplete. If there had been more information previously about this, or even a couple of dedicated chapters in A Memory of Light about it, it would've felt far more consistent with the rest of the series. He actually reminds me of some random 'Boss Mob' from an MMO, especially his constant shouts about Rand coming out to face him.<br /><br />2. Where are the huge armies? Over the course of the previous books it was explained that there would be a titanic battle or series of battles. There were numbers provided that led me to believe there would be millions of Trollocs, at least a couple of million soldiers in the army of the Light, and likely thousands of channelers involved. The Aiel alone were supposed to number close to a million and have a thousand or more Wise Ones. Instead this final book is using armies in the tens of thousands. Perhaps a hundred thousand total in the armies of the Light, a few hundred thousand Trollocs total, and only hundreds of channelers in total.<br /><br />  I was expecting assaults on all of the major cities, roving armies traveling via gateway, and circles of men and women using the One Power to its full potential. Nowhere previously was it mentioned that 90 percent of the forces on both sides had been killed, so I'm extremely confused by this.<br /><br />3. Many deaths or decisions seem out of character. I'm not upset that major characters die. That's expected, and even deaths due to stupid misfortune aren't anything I'd complain about. This book centers on a gigantic battle, and people die due to misfortune in those circumstances. Being trapped under a horse, shot by a stray arrow, overwhelmed in an ambush, or even tripping and falling in a particularly bad way I could accept. My problem is with characters acting far out of line with their established patterns. Well, that and the sudden revelation of new information used to justify their demise.<br /><br />  The most glaring example of this is Egwene, the Amyrlin, taking on Mazrim Taim head on, burning herself out, and dying in a glorious display of anti-balefire. She's one of thestrongest, most disciplined, and most creative of all the main characters, but she rushes in and uses brute force with no real explanation. There's absolutely no subtlety to her battle. Suddenly discovering an anti-balefire weave doesn't change the fact that she's possibly the least likely character to rush in, guns blazing, on a suicide run. Grief over her husband's death isn't an excuse for someone with her level of discipline behaving that way. The fact that her husband, Gawyn's death is another example of strangely aberrant behavior from someone who was supposed to be past rash stupidity just makes it worse.<br /><br />  And on a related note, neither is her sa'angreal having no buffer an excuse for Egwene's death. I'm actually calling BS on that. Callandor was singled out specifically in earlier books as being unusual and dangerous because it didn't have a buffer. It's supposed to be critical to have one in all angreal, especially powerful ones, precisely to prevent damage to the user. The Choedan Kal had a buffer in the form of the access keys, and it's never mentioned as missing from any other angreal, anywhere. And yet we're informed via a revelation that the most powerful sa'angreal the White Tower has, one that has been in use for generations, and that Egwene herself used to the point of exhaustion in an earlier book, is missing this critical component. This is the worst kind of contrived garbage excuse to rationalize killing off a major character. A big rock falling from the sky when she happened to be looking the other way, that I could accept, but not her death as described in this book.<br /><br />4. The intelligence and sophistication of the characters is extremely lacking in this final installment. For instance, in a series that has featured compulsion and dreamwalking, and Forsaken who like to use both to defeat their enemies, it's absurd that no protection was provided to the army generals to prevent Graendal from manipulating them. Moiraine is protecting her own dreams as standard practice every night early on in the series, and the need for such protection is common knowledge among the Wise Ones and Aes Sedai long before the Last Battle. The intelligent, cunning, and experienced characters I remember from previous books would've set wards and had guardians watching the general's dreams from the other side just in case. True Power being capable of bypassing wards or not, the Wise One dreamwalkers and the Aes Sedai in the real world should have been acting as guards to stop Graendal from getting close enough to even try it.<br /><br />5. The Aiel. I don't understand why they were suddenly relegated to a background role. They were previously noted as having great tactical prowess and their leaders were considered as being the equals of the great wetlander generals. They had never suffered a major Trolloc invasion because they were too strong and smart to defeat. But now suddenly they're just skirmishers? And Rhuarc isn't put in charge of his own position to defend? WTF? I never use WTF, but it's really deserved here. I feel like Brandon Sanderson completely betrayed the whole Aiel storyline. Rand learned the lost song that could renew the world but never taught it to them, they're only used as skirmishers and archers, Rhuarc is just some guy instead of a brilliant general who previously defeated many of the wetlander commanders he's now expected to serve, the Wise Ones are almost ignored... There's just so much plot and potential wasted here that it hurts my head.<br /><br />6. The battle that Rand has with the Dark One seems almost like a retake on the Mistborn (one of Sanderson's earlier works) ending with its battle of wills outside space and time, but it's even less satisfying. I was expecting more. More detail, more information, more subtlety.<br /><br />  The way the Rand vs. The Dark One segments are used feels like a series of predictable commercial breaks for the unending sequence of bad decisions orcalamitous misfortunes endured by the other characters. Instead of a worthy ending, we end up with 'The Light cannot abide without the Dark' essentially. I understand the concept and I saw it coming about thirteen books ago. But the way it was actually laid out was so obvious and immature that it was insulting. This is the end of an epic fourteen book series, not some bad young adult vampire trilogy. And I think that basically summarizes my feeling on this book overall. The last two were just so good that I can't understand how this happened.
B00005MCWZ|4.0|Everyone talks of Hawkwind, so I gave it a look. I like it but it doesn't blow my socks off like other bands of than genre.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Amazing. Just one word to describe the incredible gameplay, both campaign and multiplayer, of MC4. This is the 4th game in the very successful Modern Combat series. Its interesting plot, amazing graphics, and ponderous audio do not disappoint. It has been improved in countless ways such as the quantity of available weaponry, and the addition of a military shop that allows players to upgrade themselves and to customize their weapons. If you are new to the series, I imagine you are looking at the $6.99 price tag(I know I was.) It is worth every penny. Think of an Xbox game;$60 for a game you only can play at home. This $6.99 game has the same quality, if not better, it is mobile, for a 1/6 the price. BTW, if you honestly weren't going to buy it because of the storage space you are making a huge mistake. I mean for all the stuff included in the game what did you expect? Buy it. You WILL NOT be disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks-

B008GM9O6A|2.0|While some of the information was good and interesting almost all of the characters talked like they were so sure of themselves and their opinions were the only right ones.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I enjoyed this book, especially given the number of pages.  It kept my attention throughout.  Given it's 800 plus pages, I was glad I opted for the Kindle version, as this in hardback would have stayed at home on my last trip.  It's a good Clancy read.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I like the space and the distribution of this medium size back.  It's great piece to keep your equipment while going 'round.  The price is excellent.

B000H7J9RQ|1.0|I saw this years ago- and decided I wanted to add this to our collection.<br />Sadly, we were never able to view it- as it would not come up on our DVD recorder.  What to do???<br />I need help!  Shall I return for credit??

B0038AUY96|2.0|Not at all like &#34;Headhunters&#34;.<br />I would rate it 1,5 star if I could.<br />Mr. Nesbo is trying too hard to keep the reader's interest by turning around the story's stream again and again.<br />Actually I found myself trying to concentrate and remember what I had been reading the night before, so that I could continue the next day.  On a total of only 30% of the book, I was looking forward to picking it up again and read.<br />Regardless, I also get a feeling that Mr. Nesbo is a softer, more civilized version of what we would call &#34;chauvinist&#34; some years ago.<br />Well, who cares..?
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors.  Mitch Rapp remained true to character, but also displayed the ability to look beyond his need for revenge if it means improving chances to beat the bad guys. Loved the ending.  Hmmm, what could this mean for future books?!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Really, I am not as snobbish as the purist, I really love the film, and the emotion of the live singing as it was filming.  Congratulations on their success, and I purchased the soundtrack the morning after I saw it.  The only thing negative is that although these are the highlights, there's no option to purchase the entire soundtrack, and there are some beautiful songs missing.

When I say artist I mean, Ms. Hill, Lupe fiasco, Nas, Mos Def, Andre 3000 etc.<br /><br />The album is one that can't truly be appreciated without listening completely, skits and all. While the production doesn't have many \\"bangers\\" it fits each track perfectly. At first glance nothing really sticks out until you hear and fully understand the whole project.<br /><br />Lamar takes a concept that isn't new, growing up/ living in the intercity, and tells a story. Even though that concept has already been done by Masta Ace and Sticky Fingaz, Lamar still manages to deliver.<br /><br />Pros<br />Practical production<br />Album concept<br />Song arrangement<br />Variety while staying on theme<br />Lyrical content<br />Soulful<br />Transcends region, west coast, can be appreciated by all<br /><br />Cons<br />Drakes on it<br />Voice and flow become monotone sometimes

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Our Book Club read Defending Jacob for our January 2013 meeting.  An easy read, packed with twists and turns but also addressed many issues, making it intellectually challenging and a good Book Club selection.  Issues addressed: trust between adults as well as between parents and children; our legal system's flaws and strengths; the divergence of individuals' memories of the same event events; genetics vs. environment; use and abuse of social media such as Facebook; and more.  Have fun with it!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My Daughter love this game and its not too hard to play. Not too many ads to worry about either...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I almost gave up at first because I seemed like a teenage love novel (I wished amazon would make reviews disclose their age as I was sure all the great reviews were from teenagers) but I'm so glad I didn't. Started off as a young naive girl new to high school who meets the \\"bad boy\\". It was hard to get into the diary style chapters but got used to it after awhile. Characters are very easy to relate to, I mean who hasn't had a crazy crush on a boy and blurts out embarrassing things around him and wanted to die!  It becomes very gripping when we find out why the boy is so engrossed with her and we discover her past in glimpses of memories and dreams as her 3 year old self.  Great book, fast read, I couldn't put it down and finished it in 3 days. The steamy scenes are very PG 13. BTW I am in my early 30's.
B003TTH5MA|5.0|I love this show and was very happy with the quality of video when downloading from Amazon. Highly recommend Amazon Instant Video.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if I had hadn't had buy a separate stand to hold the Kindle Fire vertically, portrait style.  But it's lightweight and protective for carrying the Kindle Fire in my purse.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Without giving too much away... I was left wanting a bit more, wanting a bit more out of the actors, wanting a bit more plot development, wanting more visually, and while there's the obvious tie-in to the Alien movies, there just wasn't the same suspense and 'creepiness' you got from the first two (and maybe the third... the other Alien movies kind of jumped the shark).  I will say, however, by the end, I was left anxious to see what the next installment will entail... and how any proceeding movies will relate to the original Alien.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I would watch it again and since I own it that probably will happen when I get the time to do that.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Truly enjoys this book. Full of twist and turns. The hacking was exceptional. Some events were predictable (like Harriet's disappearance). It was just a matter o time of where she would be found. I like the hunt.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was what I expected from a paperback romance.  It was funny and witty and of course everything worked out in the end for the main characters.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Just like it came out the store. I forgot I bought it online. It works great and it was brand new.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|just the right gift for grandaughter who watches doctor who all the time and knows everything about what is going on
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Very original and unique concept...a little confusing at first but I loved it.  It was well-written and kept you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recumbent this movie.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This little book was invaluable when I published the electronic version of our media manual, 'How to Survive and Win with the Media'.<br /><br />'Building your Book for Kindle' talked me through the process of converting the text to Kindle-friendly form, and I had our book up and on the net the same afternoon. Without it, I wouldn't have known where to start.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|The product Intel Core i7-3820 Quad-Core Processor 3.6 GHz 10 MB Cache LGA 2011 have a very proud performance for computing rating.

B0086700CM|4.0|loads of fun. actually gets your heart racing. I'm new to the game and make lots of mistakes but its still fun.  even failing you get a good satisfying SPLAT.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|bogs down a bit in the middle, but the begginning and last 3rd are real page turners! As usual, King's characters are well fleshed out and the story is a very interesting one.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Love this movie, love all the tinker bell movies! Bought for my daughter for Christmas and it cam fast and new as promised.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is a dictionary. I know not what to say aside from the facts. A dictionary is  large book filled with definitions of many words such as antagonist and protagonist. It is a very big definition book filled with words.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Impressive romance novel. Great writing!  I would absolutely read another by this author!  Cute story line as well added to this novel.
0425263908|4.0|I'm tired of reviews saying \\"Bared to You\\" is \\"sooooooo much better than Fifty Shades of Grey!\\"  It's not.  \\"Bared to You\\" is \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" with marginally better writing and a more palatable heroine, minus the S&M.  I happened to enjoy the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" series (though not as much as the \\"Twilight\\" series it ripped off or old school romance novels like \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\") in the way one relishes high calorie, nutritiously bereft food - with indulgent ecstasy in the moment and sheepish remorse in hindsight.  Yes, it's totally unrealistic (and likely subliminally unhealthy sexist) garbage upon which no actual human interactions ought to be modeled; but it's wonderfully entertaining nonetheless.  Bottom line: \\"Bared to You\\" is excellent lady book candy, but no more, certainly nothing new.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book.  Grabs you from the start and doesn't let go! Stephen King is one of my favorite authors to read.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|There's a kind of perfection to this . The designers have come up with  a game that utilizes sound and the visual essentials of the hd screen to challenge your spatial and kinetic abilities in a very pure way. It's real, not virtual, more like playing real marbles or painting than the role playing of other  games.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I bought this as a gift and they loved the fact that it saved space and all 4 movies were on one disc.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love having this on my Kindle to keep my available memory open.  I'm not sure yet (still learning) how to use it effectively for everything, but am glad I have a way of getting rid of apps or items I no longer want on the Kindle.<br />By the way, I found out about this on my Kindle from the &#34;customers also bought&#34; icons.  It was a great find.
B009LHWEKW|4.0|The eighth season is still going strong. I'm currently writing this review in the middle of the season so I guess that means I have no idea how it'll end, but so far it seems like it's going to be a good season.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing, I love this book. The emotional rollercoaster ride was breathtaking. I have never read a book with so much feeling. Perfectly put together!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series! I found it when Amazon recommended it. I couldn't put either Bared to you or this book down. Reading each in a day. I like the complexity of their relationship, and the fact they have to fight do hard to be together! The love scenes aren't bad either :) I have recommended this book to several people who liked 50 Shades. You won't be sorry you read this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A touch of romance, adventure, and heartfelt, this book is good for tweens and teens. But sometimes it gives you strange dreams.

B007SGM084|3.0|Greetings all,<br />As an avid reader (mostly Si-Fi/Fantasy) I read this after hearing all the hype. I was somewhat disappointed. The overall story line was typical. Girl meets over wealthy boy. He falls for her, she falls for him. James' writing though seems a bit dry in my opinion, as well as very repetitive. The books seemed to lack a lot of detail especialy when it comes to the S&M/BDSM life style that the characters delv into. In general the books didn't contain the &#34;WOW&#34; factor I expected after all the media attention.
B004DM0UII|4.0|this is been handy so far and with very few conectivity issues. I look forward to continuing to use this as it does have several nice features including hush to talk, favoites, and automatic reconnect.  I would like to see it have more of the stations that are close to me. So as this continues to improve I would give it 5 stars.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Loved this book. Very different story but got very caught up in it. Good characters with lots of twists &turns. Would recommend this book.
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|Wonderful acting by a first class group of actors. Great directing by Billy Wilder. Any fan of Jack Lemmon or Shirley MacLaine will love this film!

B000SEGUDE|3.0|I tried very hard to get into this book, but in the beginning the characters were boring and I could see a connection to the story line I saw in the movie of the same name.
1451613512|5.0|What courage, brains and convictions to be a part of this fantastic film, that finally tells the truth about this country. I'm totally aware of all this, and just shocked that anyone would have the courage to bring it to light in main stream media.<br />I'm a decorated soldier, fifth generation American that knows first hand why we fight, and what our motives are, and the dreadful lies we tell to brain wash people into thinking we don't hurt others for money or power or resources, when in fact that's exactly what we do, and I'm ashamed of this country today.  What we really stand for offers little to be proud of anymore as our goodness seems to be part of how our banks do, and not freedom of the people. I'm brokenhearted as to how crooked our government is, while the people here stand by and do nothing at all, but play videos, twitter and watch reality T.V. shows made for fools.<br />Killing 650,000 innocent Iraqis to get 6 corrupt men is just one example of how Americans are equally violent and blood thirsty, and are so ignorant, they play perfectly into the brainwashing that goes on by our politicians and media all day long to us.<br />Every American needs to at least watch this series, and make up your own mind, and hopefully together, one day we unite, and take this once glorious land back from the handful of crooks that control us all now, and drain us of any wealth we have while pretending to help us.<br />Best series ever.
0385536828|4.0|It's the 1970's in Britain, and for those who remember the Cold War, things are pretty dark and dreary. There isn't much for beautiful Serena Frome, the daughter of an Anglican bishop and a math major at Cambridge, to look forward to. Then she meets a charming older man who soon becomes her lover and drafts her for M15, the British intelligence service. Before long her lover deserts her, but Serena is hooked and throws herself into an undercover operation known as Sweet Tooth. Intelligence is looking for writers whose politics mesh with those of the government and Serena, a great reader of novels, is assigned to infiltrate the literary circle of a group of promising young writers and meets an attractive man named Tom Haley.  At first she just loves his writing, but soon falls in love with the man himself, and thus begins for her a glorious, but also troubled affair. She despises her own duplicity, and longs to tell Tom the truth, but espionage demands she reveal nothing. So poor Serena is torn between her lover and her loyalty to the government. The result is a profound, and often witty tale of romance and intrigue, as well as betrayal, as Serena struggles to find her true self.
B00A9D0K2G|5.0|I chose this rating because the 4 invisible people in high school became big super stars.  I would recommend this movie to my friends who are in 5th grade.
B008FOB124|5.0|This album is the first new album in 16 years by the Australian band Dead Can Dance. Though both the artist have worked on solo careers and done well it's great to see them back together again. The music is fantastic as each of them explores subjects that are close to their hearts and I think the number and range of instruments used has increased.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Came packaged with another item I had ordered. I loved this movie and am glad I was able to get it for a good price
0757302661|5.0|I purchased this book along with taking the HypnoBirthing class at the hospital.  I spent so many ours listening to Marie's voice.  The book has great information on the basic foundational theories of the method, along with sample birth plans and other helpful resources.  The CD was great, it had a few options for guided imagery.  My favorite were the words of affirmation.<br /><br />When the time came, I was induced for medical reasons, and spent 23 hours in labor with the CD in my ipod for most of it.  It kept me relaxed and calm.  Eventually, I'm sorry to say I had to get the epi in order to dilate.<br /><br />Overall, I was not able to have a natural child birth, but I feel that it was because I was induced and didn't dilate, not because I was not prepared.  For my next baby, I plan to practice with this book and CD again, and I feel that if I go into labor naturally, I feel confident that I could have a natural child birth.  The book states why being induced is more challenging, but sometimes it is unavoidable.<br /><br />I would recommend this for all pregnant women.  It has good information about your body and your baby whether you plan to birth naturally or not.  It has good skills to learn how do do to relax yourself while pregnant, and afterward.  I still use some of the techniques today.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The game is very fun. The graphics are nice and i love how they give you the chance to gain gold without paying, although its harder. I am waiting for them to fix a few freezes before i spend money. Cant wait to get more heroes!

I CAN'T press the button because it is off the screen on the bottom.<br /><br />Hope they fix this.  I'd like to give them 5 stars!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|this epic history had already generated an epic film. the book should be read by every student of american history.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Although Prometheus suffers from a few story elements that don't seem to add up, it perhaps suffered even greater from the anticipation that many felt for the movie prior to its release. That anticipation - couple with the ambiguity of whether or not the movie was a direct prequel - set the movie up for disappointment in the eyes of some.<br /><br />The storyline in Prometheus is not original. It is a play on the ancient astronaut theory in the context of the Alien universe. In the film, scientists discover a map and view it as an invitation, which launches a trek across the galaxy that ultimately leads to disaster. Such a story needs to rely on acting and atmosphere to be successful, and Prometheus accomplishes just that. Noomi Rapace is fantastic as the lead, while Idris Elba is a scene-stealer and Michael Fassbender deserves as many rewards and praise that can be heaped upon him. His portrayal of the android David is nothing less than astonishing as he walks a fine line between emotionless and calculating. Although Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce feel wasted, Pearce's viral TED talk is a fantastic set-up for Weyland's motivations in accompanying the crew on their journey.<br /><br />There are certainly unanswered questions. Prometheus was written by one of the producers of Lost, so this should have been expected right away. These are good unanswered question though since you'll find yourself debating them with friends for months after seeing the film. For example, the plot holes and mischaracterizations, on the other hand, stop this film from reaching its full potential. Much has been made of the biologist's ridiculously enthusiastic treatment of the snake creature; however, deleted scenes show an earlier moment when that enthusiasm is directed towards minor worm life forms. Had this scene - which fleshes out the character and his personality - remained in the film, it would have made that scene less ridiculous. Alternatively, the death of Charlize Theron's character due to her inability to run to either side of the tumbling spaceship remains unforgiveable, while the ending sequence with the xenomorph only further confuses whether or not this is a prequel.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the film is still highly enjoyable and thought-provoking. It meets the visual expectations of a Ridley Scott Alien movie, and provides a good storyline that allows for intelligent debate.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|The Kindle fits snuggly in the case, with easy access to the power buttons and charging port.<br /><br />I also like the stand feature of this case, but it only props the Kindle horizontally, which isn't always ideal.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding read. On hype, just what actually happened. All along I thought Obama shot Osama. just cannot believe what comes out of the WH.
030759565X|5.0|We have found so many great recipes in this book.  The mushroom bourguignon, spaghetti squash tacos and cauliflower pesto are just a few of the unique and delicious recipes we've tried from the book so far.<br /><br />A problem we often have with cookbooks in my family is each family member having a favorite cookbook.  This cookbook has been used by all of the cooks in our household repeatedly.
B009JBZH54|1.0|There are no menus (no there isn't a pop-up either for others that have countered this argument in these reviews) I have tried 3 different Blu-ray players - 1 brand new Pioneer Elite, a 1 year old Sony, and a 1 year old Panasonic.<br /><br />Even if there was a pop-up menu, you can't pause or stop and then resume playing.  You can't turn off your player and have it resume either.  Phail.  Trying to get a replacement copy and see if I just got a bad copy.  The other low reviews are all quality issues and complaining about the Ultraviolet copy which I don't care about.
0385535147|4.0|John Grisham has done it again.  He has cranked out another yarn to keep you awake turning the pages late into the night.  With much that will be familiar to Grisham's readers, The Racketeer tells the story of disillusionment with the legal system, revenge, and a quest for personal redemption.  Grisham does take a turn that I didn't expect, with a con job worthy of a David Mamet film.<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister made the mistake of naively taking the wrong client and got roped into a major racketeering case.  Though he did nothing wrong (intentionally, anyway), he ended up doing time in a federal prison, where he gained a reputation among inmates as a great jailhouse lawyer.  Using information gleaned from other inmates, he offers information about the murder of a federal judge in exchange for his freedom.  The feds give him a cash reward and a new identity, and Bannister begins his plot in earnest.<br /><br />Bannister, who I believe is Grisham's first African-American main character, has the brains and devious wits of many of his other characters.  The Racketeer itself has the brains but quite a bit more wit (in various senses of the word) than other Grisham novels.  I knew there was something fishy going on, and at first blamed it on the stupid story.  I should have known better; Grisham puts it all together with flair.<br /><br />Grisham doesn't write for high-brow literary meat, but as a story teller.  He spins a tasty yarn here that, more so than many of his other books, will satisfy your literary sweet tooth.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|If you like Bond movies you will like this one. There is lots of action throughout the entire movie. Great car chase scenes along with spectacular stunts.
0307887448|5.0|As someone who grew in the 80s (Born mid seventies), this book floods you with all the shows,<br />movies, books and games of the era. This is one big geek fest with D&D modules, computer games,<br />and cult movies tied semi-neatly together with an interesting enough plot.<br /><br />I just loved the book and already recommended it to several people from my age group.<br /><br />I suspect younger people, oblivious to 80s culture may find it a little \\"flat\\" - There's a tendency<br />for Kline to just \\"name Names\\" at times, and make this feel like a grocery list.<br /><br />I must mention I own the audio book which is much improved IMHO by the reading of Will Wheaton (W. Crusher to you :-))<br /><br />So, 4 star book, 5 star trip down memory lane and lots of fun!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first book was hands down the best. There were times in the late books where the story came off rushed. All in all, it was a good read and well worth the money.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like this game! was disappointed in the 2 games G5. I paid for that didn't last long after the free trial hope this one isn't as disappointing.. great story line so far game give you a lot of info and notes.
0525953728|5.0|I have always been enamored by the Navy SEALS and their operations. The book covers Owen's time through BUDS, Green Team, and DEVGRU (Seal Team 6). The book chronicles the events of the operation in great detail without telling anything that wasn't already communicated through the press. It organized the series of events in such a way that I felt I was standing aside from the operations as an onlooker.<br /><br />I read the book cover to cover in less than a day. I've reread the book as well. I would love an opportunity to shake Mark Owen's hand, and say thank you to one of the greatest heroes of our day. Books like this will help the public to appreciate the selflessness and dedication of our most elite soldiers, and hopefully inspire others to be the best they can be.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I think they suck, but my daughter loves the band, and she has enjoyed listening to it since the day she got it.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Face it: It's Top Gun.<br /><br />Double disc set with special features. Some behind the scenes features actually taught me something I didn't know about one of my favorite movies.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|It was one of our favorite holiday movies we watch every year.  We always watched it on TV right before Christmas, but it was nice watching it without commercials. Thanks.
B0076DELIG|5.0|What can I say? I love Harry Bosch, and I love Michael Connelly. I kind of expect the umpteenth in the series to not be as good as the earlier books, but this was great. I just found Connelly in the past year or so, so I read all of these, in order. Had to wait for the last two, though. This was my favorite.
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|My 6 year o l d liked it, but it wasn't my favorite. The main character was lazy and he lacked any kind of integrity.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It is amazingly fun. My brother and I really enjoy it. It did crash at one point and force me to restart, though that was kind of a mixed bonus. I finally got a hippo afterwords. The thing that bothers me is the peanuts. They are required for things...not optional. To top it off,  I find the animal prices a bit obsurd. You have to pay $5 just to get enough for one peanut-only animal,  possibly more. Now if I could get 3 or 4 at that I probably would consider. It just feels like a lot,  and there is no alternative.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|What a joy to read the first volume of this new epic saga from Brandon Sanderson. Looking forward to the next volume

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Christian Grey and Anna's story come to a close, but I have to say E L James does a great job with making you want to start the books all over again after reading the Epilogue and especially Christian's viewpoint at the end of the book.  I immediately picked up the first book and started the series all over again.  I guess you can say I found my fantasy boyfriend!
B0052GACNM|5.0|For anyone who loves this great singer crooning with other great singers, this is a must.  Definately recommend it for anyones record collection.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow!  I don't know what more to say!  Twists and Turns throughout.  It's actually been awhile since I read this (about 30 books ago) but I am ready to pick it up and read it again.  I couldn't put it down when I started.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|K. D. Lang is one of those singers who comes along once in a great while.  Although many call themselves singers, most are not.  Lang is one of my few favorites.  When she sings Hallelujah, I am moved to tears.<br /><br />Definately a must buy.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Bought this to protect my Kindle Fire while in my purse or wherever I am going, but find I used the folding stand and prop it up horizontally to read a lot.  Made very well and the Fire snaps in securely.  I bought white which might have been a mistake just because I work in a sort of &#34;dusty&#34; environment and not sure it will be white for long, but it wipes clean and I really like it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Hats off to Mumford & Sons.  This is a fantastic album which I would recommend to any of my friends.
B00846REIS|5.0|While I really enjoyed the book, in the beginning there were just too many similarities to The Fifty Shades of Grey book with how they meet, to the enormous wealth of Gideon... but then it gets goooooood!  I'm a fan of Sylvia Day's.  She doesn't disappoint! wink! wink!
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I love this movie.  I love the fact that this guy has such a mellow look on things.  He is certainly wise beyond his years;}
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm sure there will be a movie out soon with this book.  Can't wait for the 2 more months for Walking Disaster.  Jamie McGuire does a great job writing about her characters, adding a little mystery to them that you have to figure out along the way. I can literally picture all of these characters and really enjoy watching them develop in the story.  The story has everything... flirting, romance, love, secrets, action, heart break, tears and humor.  I can't wait for more.
1596680180|3.0|If that gets you going, or if that's a resource you need, then get this book.  I was exploring rope-work at the time, so I really wasn't set up for it's content.  Still, I've kept the book, and found it useful in my rope-work projects!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again.  She creates characters you want to love and sometime hate but helps you understand them and live vicariously through them.  I enjoyed the story to book 2 and have been waiting for what seems like FOREVER for #3 Entwined by You to come out.  Please Sylvia... you can't leave us hanging much longer!
B0091LS07E|4.0|This CD is not as good as Alicia Keys early CD's, but it has some good songs and you can hear the growth in her music.<br />It's a CD that grows on you the more you listen to it, and it deserves a listen.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has a way of always tugging at my heart strings.  You read on and on hoping everything works out perfectly the way we all want it to be.  But then there is reality and he unfortunately always keeps it real and it breaks my heart every time.  A wonderful story and emotional as well.  I was emotionally drained after reading it.  If you like Nicholas Sparks style of writing (which I do!) then you will pretty much enjoy everything he creates.
0440422965|2.0|Pure fluff, although well-written since it's by Grisham. I light read for the holidays that I found to be pretty predictable. A few funny moments but all in all, reminded me of a Family Channel movie.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|A great story.  I enjoyed the whole story.  Great characters and a bit of humor along with the sadness of the story too.  You can't help but cheer for the main characters all the way through.
0525478817|5.0|Although this is a young adult novel, I loved every sentence of it. The characters were so very human and you fell in love with them quickly, absorbed by their situations and the ways they chose to manage their cancer-driven lives. So many light-hearted moments, too. I think/hope this will become a classic for teens and possibly their parents.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't not stop dreaming about Christian Grey.  A fun and light read with a nice way to be introduced to erotica novels.  Very much enjoyed the series.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This was a part of my first gaming build and I have to say, so far I am very happy with this. It was suggested to me from a few people on BAPC, as well as some friends who were pretty experienced. From the benchmarks and stats I've seen online I was very confident in my purchase and it did not disappoint. I currently do not have it overclocked (as many gamers do immediately it seems like) but it's nice having the capability to later. Also using a Hyper evo 212 and no heat problems at all. Highly recommend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book, the second book the most!  I liked watching the characters grow and seeing the emotional struggles of Christian letting go of control and falling more and more in love with Anna.  Anna's surprising strength as she shows a little more backbone to Christian and loosens up a bit too.  An enjoyable fantasy read.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Earlier customer reviews were on the mark.  This book left the reader wondering what happened to the main charcaters and hungry for their update.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I think I just kept expecting something more to come from the story.  I mean it was good and I expect every parent that has to go through with something like this would be the same.  I just felt it kind of left me empty after reading it.  But then... not every story ends with a happily ever after.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Lots of twists and plot surprises.  Sad to lose characters we all liked, so wonder if another plot change is in the future????
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover does a great job on this book.  I enjoyed the plot, the characters and the outcome.  It definitely had a surprising twist or two to the story which I always enjoy.  I can see myself reading it again in a week or two.  this would make a great movie if you ask me!
B004UA8D2S|5.0|The title of this excellent film is particularly well chosen, as \\"sanctum\\" means a secret place known only to few people and also a sacred or holy area. This film tells the story of a group of people who are forced by circumstances to enter such a place - and then try desperately to find a way out... This review contains some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Produced by James Cameron this film contains some elements (the masterful use of lights and shadows, a predisposition for blue and gray, some very dramatic fast happening scenes) which remind of his films. It was however directed by an Australian director, Alister Grierson, who made only one film before, \\"Kokoda\\", which was a rather good war movie. With the exception of Ioan Gruffudd actors were unknown to me, but they all did an excellent job.<br /><br />The story is relatively simple. A group of cave-divers is slowly and methodically exploring and mapping a HUGE complex of partially inundated caves in New Guinea. An unexpected development will force them to explore this place in depth (pun very much intentional) and on the double, taking enormous risks - and I am not saying anything more.<br /><br />This film has absolutely NO supernatural elements - do not expect monsters, mysterious forces, etc. Everything is realistic, sometimes inspired by real problems met by speleologists and cave-divers in the real life - even if the accumulation of all those events during just one expedition is of course rather unlikely, but after all this is an adventure film...<br /><br />The atmosphere of the place of action is absolutely unique. There are moments that I really had the impression that heroes entered a kind of grandiose heathen temple, immensely ancient and so holy that it was never meant to be seen by humans. And indeed, at moments there seems that there is a HIGH price to pay for discovering secrets and splendors, which were not really meant for us. It can almost seem that those who entered there were not meant to leave - and this chtonic \\"inner sanctum\\" will show great reluctance to release those who violated its peace...<br /><br />There are many excellent scenes in this film but none so tense and moving as the great finale, an absolutely unique thing different from anything else I saw on the screen. I was absolutely delighted with this film both in cinema and on Blu-ray (I warmly recommend to buy Blu-ray, as the visual aspect is important) and I am absolutely keeping this film to re-watch it another time in the future. Enjoy!e - and this chtonic \\"inner sanctum\\" will show great reluctance to release those who violated its peace...<br /><br />There are many excellent scenes in this film but none so tense and moving as the great finale, an absolutely unique thing different from anything else I saw on the screen.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So well written, you fall instantly in love with all the characters and John Greens writing is so raw that any loss would feel as though you had just lost a family member. The world he creates in this book is just so real. He just earned himself a tried and true fan.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|Paid for it, but it won't let me watch it. The region code is A, Australia and U.K. is B.<br />I hate region coding. If you live in Australia, Europe, or New Zealand better off to illegally download it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A great read and hard to put down. A good plot line with plenty of twists. If you enjoy suspense and hero that does anything to win, you'll love this book.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I'm not usually interested in fantasy, but after trying a sample, I decided to read this book. There was just enough action, sex, and suspense to keep my attention to the end of the book. The plot was interesting. The characters were well-developed.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|It looks great on my Olympus PEN 1. There is ridge detail on the logo and I like that, it feels well made for such a small plastic part which is what I would expect for my camera. I had lost the lens cap and needed a replacement. It fits perfectly, no problems.<br /><br />Pros: Looks great and fits perfectly.<br />Cons: None..................
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|The movie Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise should be shunned by all true followers of Lee Childs series of books about the \\"real\\" Jack Reacher. I refuse to see the movie, although I've seen previews. Jack Reacher is 6 foot 4 and probably 285 pounds of no-nonsense, former Army cop. To star a short little primadonna like Cruise is an insult. I have to believe he bought the part and Hollywood, was too stupid to use someone like Samuel L Jackson or Liam Neeson who much better fit the part. I invite anyone to read any of Lee Childs \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels and then disagree with me. Nuff said.

It's a 2 disc set, plus a DVD (which I haven't watched yet), but the first disc just spins, makes a bunch of noise in my laptop and won't play.  Disc 2 plays fine, but it's disappointing that I can't listen to the songs on disc one. :/
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think that this game is really good and it gets people to like animals more.I liked how you can do things with your pets and design your own village. Some of the games I have played before did everything for you and it was annoying.So that is why I personally like this game.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Though Ms Collins Hunger Games is far out and sometimes gross I can see this happening in the USA the way our leaders are headed.....no respect for life....only in what entertains them to the greatest extent. Reminds me of the treatment of early Christians being thrown into lions dens to entertain the emperors and their cronies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this app a few months back and still haven't finished all the levels!<br /><br />The first few levels are really easy but they certainly get harder as you go on, it really make you think :)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

1400069289|3.0|There could be more case studies to back this up, and a little more extrapolation on habit building, but the case studies were powerful and the entire thing was written in an easy to read and entertaining way, breaking down the necessary points. A little weak towards the conclusion, but the crux of it is the examples. Asks a lot of questions it leaves unanswered, but that's ok to. It was a quick read and I'm glad I purchased it. Not sure if i gleaned anything I hadn't already from excerpts and reviews of the book, online, though, if you're on the fence.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It was difficult absorbing the human degradation told by Shin of his life in Camp 14. I hope this book makes the same impact on western society that Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" did in the 19th century. Anyone not moved by this story is already far more \\"dead\\" than Shin was in Camp 14. Many thanks to Mr. Harden and all the people who help Shin and all the other escaped slaves tell their stories.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I rarely shell out $.99 for an app (wow that makes me sound super cheap doesn't it?!), but this is more than worth the price.  Hours of playability, lots of entertainment, and adding the different levels of invection adds to the depth of the game as well.<br /><br />I highly recomend naming your plague after your significant other, and then showing them the screen with something along the lines of \\"So-and-so\\" is about to wipe out humanity.<br /><br />Good times, good times!
0765325950|5.0|Thank God for Brandon Sanderson!  This was a fitting end to the series I've spent the past 20+ years reading and falling in love with.  While the book isn't completely without flaws, it still wraps up the series better than I had expected and delivers more action in a single chapter than Books 7-9 put together!  If you're a fan of the series I'm not sure why you are reading reviews, you already own this and have probably read it by now.  If you are coming to the series new, please ignore all the protests from whiners, complainers, and haters.  Sure it would be nice to have the eBook on day 1, but if you are new to the series you won't be starting here anyway!  Go pick up The Eye of the World and get ready for an epic tale!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I so enjoy Judi Dench and when I saw this advertised on TV I knew I wanted to get it when I became available here on Amazon. It was amazing in all aspects of the film. The choice of actors, the acting, the sites, the premise of the movie were all woven together so beautifully to create a very touching and very real thing that could have happened to anyone who travels in a group. I also enjoyed the part after the movie was over where you can see how the film was created and hear the director's and the actor's comments and more. It's a treasure I will watch again and again.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD! I got addicted very quickly! I love how all the characters work together!
B008SOS63S|5.0|This cd set has become one of my favorites. I have recommended it to my friends and family. Luv it!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I just loved this version of Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber version). Since I've seen it on broadway, I can see the similarities and differences between scenes. Yes, some scenes have changed, but I think if you want as close to a broadway experience as possible to buy this movie. Ramin Karimloo is one of my favorite Phantoms of all time and does an amazing job.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it does what I expect evermote to do. it is clean looking. I can fully use the program on my kindle. it is very nice for a free app.
B006AN78XS|4.0|......just another one of Woody Allen's. I watched it on a Monday Night and was not disappointed in its genre. Enjoy your viewing :)<br /><br />Vadim
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW what a great book. The subject mattter of this novel is disturbing and sad, but handled so well with the romance angle. I was totally taken by the characters, the description of their feelings and how such a disturbing thing could have major implications to all those around. I must admit I was surprised by the unexpected twists in this story as I read and how it all came together at the end. Great book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I have read a few other free kindle books recently that were terrible disappointments, which is why I had low, low expectations for this little novel, but it blew my expectations out of the water. I laughed out loud, cried out loud, smiled, blushed...it was sweet and sexy but very tasteful. I finished it in two nights but nearly stayed up all night the first night because I didn't want to put it down.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This app is great, but it keeps having a connection error for multiplayer when I have connection. Please fix that soon other then that it's a good app I'm not sure why people are fussing about the &quot;rewards&quot;, but it's not a bother to me.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Everyone needs to view this video, to have a better understanding of what the real causes were behind the latest economic meltdown
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|So I've met Gene Kim in person and had heard of this book project he was working on, and how it portended to be a modern-day IT based iteration of 'The Goal'.<br /><br />I had first read The Goal more than a dozen years ago, and while it's not the best literature, it is one of the best business novels I've encountered and a good way of explaining the theory of constraints. But The Goal has been a revolutionary book for those who read it, people still tout it as an incredible book all these years later. This meant that I had my doubts about the aspirations. I grabbed the Kindle version the day it was released, and started reading and couldn't stop, literally read the entire book in one sitting. As a recovering operations guy I could empathize with many of the characters in the book, and 'knew' their pain at many points in the story. At the same time, this book does a great job of explaining not just the theory, but showing it in practice. It's still early days, but I think that it is entirely possible it will bring the DevOps revolution about in much the same way as Constraint Theory was propelled by The Goal.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Excellent documentary, It really opened your eyes to who's controlling the food industry and how its works. I would recommend this product.
B0013V33DG|5.0|This is another DVD that is just a lot of fun.  The cast is excellent.  The story is ridiculous, but engages you from beginning to end.  This is another great DVD to introduce young people to opera.
B00338QENI|3.0|The Author must be careful when she labels a book 100% Non Fiction.  While the facts that Henrietta's cells continue to live long after she  has passed are  indusputable I wonder, for example how could she know Henreitta discovered a lump while examining herself in the bath tub...  I have to pause when I read a book and the author does not atleast mention that perhaps everything in the book is not 100% accurate but a close to the truth as she sees it or interprets it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I have read all of them and can't wait till the next installment comes out in fall 2013
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not read any of Stephen Kings book in a long time, I really enjoyed this one.  Could not put this book down.  To imagine changing history and the consequences of finding if different.  Two thumbs up!!  Highly recommended reading!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|easy to use. figures out simple figures fast, great for the grocery store when you are on a budget because you have an expensive phone bill each month!
B004JMSIRC|4.0|it was a gift so i uess it was fine. I haven't heard anything more. The price was good and  he was happy
B005WUHAX8|2.0|like the case but it was damaged when i got it. the piece that is supposed to cover the camera lens was popped out and there was a piece of plastic floating around with it.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|It was a gift. Price was good and he like it, made a great gift. Must have worked fine i havn't heard any differnt.
B004F77SHC|5.0|this is perfect for the ultimate &#34;Twilight&#34; fan. I have the first two in the same style but I can't find &#34;Breaking Dawn Part 1&#34; in it. :(
6301966562|5.0|Loved this movie and would love to be able to share it with my grandchildren. I can't believe it is not released in the DVD format for the US.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love LOVE LOVEEEE this series! I think I like it better than &#34;Twilight&#34; and if you knew me that says a lot, I am pretty much the ultimate &#34;Twilight&#34; fan. Amazing story! Every girl needs a little Christian Grey in her life. &#60;3
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|It was hard to find this movie anywhere. Glad I bought it. Very good story and acting is great. I recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a very good, suspense filled book series. I love it. Every girl should read it. Great love story.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I REALLY LOVE RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES BUT THIS ONE JUST LEFT ME HANGING , I WAS EXPECTING MORE OUT OF THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS JUST SUPER REPETITIVE YOU ALREADY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IT WAS SO PREDICTABLE AND IT WAS NO WHAT I EXPECTED
B009O2XY12|3.0|Bubble Mania  Too few balls.  Supposed to be free but ask if I want to purchase more balls for $.99.  Then it's not free.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE IT WAS A DIFFERENT SANTA CLAUS MOVIE , ALTHOUGH IT DID SHOW HOW SELFISH SOME OF THE CHARACTERS WERE IT ALSO SHOWED HOW 1 PERSON CAN REALLY CARE ABOUT ANOTHER . IT SHOWED MY KIDS HOW A PERSON CAN BE GOOD WITHOUT EXPECTING ANYTHING IN RETURN
B00785P2QC|5.0|Well this game is good so far. I havnt gotten very far yet but hoping to get really far into it.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE TO ME IS ONE OF THE BEST OUT OF ALL BATMAN MOVIES THE JOKER MAKES THIS MOVIE AND THATS WHY I LV THE COVER WITH HIM ON IT
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Can't really add anything that hasn't already been written several times over in other reviews but wanted to give it another 5 star rating. I am not a vegan or an ultra runner but this book is a page turner.
B008LUM0G8|4.0|dissapointed with the ending of the final  book ,i feel like i have many unanswered questions.although i loved the series overall andiwould highly recommend it.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire. This app would be more fun if somehow they could get rid of the delay between when you hit the keys on the keyboard and when you hear the noise. Also, I would love to see an app that has a larger range of notes...<br />*** After watching my little girl use this app more I appreciate it more! She loves picking a song tutorial & tapping away at it to play a sweet melody or harmony. You can pick either the left or right hand part to play. Neat-o!
1582701709|4.0|It was pretty easy to understand but took so long to get to the secret ...thought i never would..should have started out earlier giving more of a clue as to what the secret was instead of half way through it..but it was good..but think the science of getting rich was easier to get to the point faster.
B000W9399S|5.0|This is not my first of Terry Pratchett's work, but it is the first &#34;Discworld&#34; book I've tried.  I'm hooked.  Pratchett always makes me laugh, usually by pointing out his characters' humanity.  I like fantasy but a lot of it is written like a formula and the storyline is just not that interesting. Not so with &#34;The Color of Magic.&#34;  I really like the world he create & the characters in the book are funny.  I liked Piers Anthony's &#34;Xanth&#34; novels when I was younger, but they were written to revolve around puns.  Those books were hilarious, but Pratchett's stories are hilarious without sacrificing the tale. I can't wait to find out what happens to the hapless wizard as he falls off the edge of the disc...
1451673442|4.0|enjoyed reading it had a lot of good stuff in it..very close to the book the Secret..and i would recommend reading it to others that want to improve their lives
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I have the regular version of LastPass on my laptop and it is absolutely wonderful.  All you have to remember is one password and whenever you go to a website that you have stored it just autofills all your information and can auto-login, too.<br />However, this ease is not quite translated to the mobile app.  When I use it on the Fire, I have to go in through the app, and you can only do one website at a time.  When you want to switch to view a different website, you have to go back to the home screen, pick LastPass again, and re-enter your password.  I'm glad to still have my passwords stored, but this is kind of a pain.  There IS an option for LastPass to autofill your password, but then they warn you that it seriously compromises your security which kind of defeats the whole purpose of LastPass.<br />*** After having used this a while I found the place at the bottom of the Fire where you can toggle & change the page you're visiting.  This made me bump up my star rating- still a little bit awkward though having to type in my password so much.
160459201X|5.0|I think this book is wonderful..and well worth the small price i paid for it..I have always wondered why things happen in life the way they do...and this book has given me the answers and since reading it..ive made a complete turn around heading two a more positive way for my life..thank you
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This is my favorite Muse album because it takes me from the darkest depths of emotion to the pinnacle of ecstasy! I'm not overexaggeraitng.  It gives me goosebumps to hear the songs. I don't know if &#34;rock opera&#34; is the right word but the songs are super-dramatic.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this product but would prefer this product to be available offline. Please offer a free recommendation for a similar product.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I haven't tried the digital copy yet but I'm pleased with the contents and extra materials.  A real bang for your buck.
1608862801|5.0|a really cool graphic novel with super colorful artwork<br /><br />kinda short but that's what i expected.<br /><br />great for anyone who really likes the show
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I don't know who the writers are, but they should keep them.  This sitcom is excellent.  I can't get enough of it.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|It is not as good as the original Angry Birds but what really got me was when you are directed to buy the next level or score all 3 stars to get it for free...after buying the game in the first place. Not cool.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|never slept so good....tried many different similar apps but this is by far my favorite. will be purchasing upgraded version soon
B001CZJKS0|5.0|I'm a huge Halloween fan and this is awesome! The small mask that comes with it is surprisingly well made and a very nice touch. Worth every penny!
B00A92MDH2|5.0|Please read the other reviews here for insights as to the compositional content and convoluted history of this, certainly among Frank Zappa's top 5 albums. This review is for the new remastering of the late (Dec.) 2012 re-release. The new remastering is astounding. Full, clear, with lots of punch but no distracting sizzle. Great separation. I have over 15 Zappa pieces from various eras (including the final two of his life, The Yellow Shark and Civilzation Phase 3) and this new version of Lather is the finest sounding of them all. If you have a prior release of Lather, get this one as it is really superior. And as a side note of my own re. the content: this 3-cd album (originally 4-LP) is approximately 1/3 the \\"juvenile humor\\" stuff but 2/3 fantastic jazz fusion/modern classical (not the atonal stuff of his final two, but the stuff that sounds like manic-Bernstein, such as some of the instrumental passages of Uncle Meat, Burnt Weeny Sandwich or Hot Rats). A must for Zappa fans.
B007F5SG22|5.0|Insightful to those of us who are ignorant of Islam & breathtaking in it's frankness & perception. Ayaan is a treasure to the world.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I got this as an alternative to an alarm clock and its just the best. it even has some really cool features
B003O86FMW|3.0|For ten chapters the story is very interesting albeit slow and distracted. Afterwards the story regurgitates the first book with less imagination. Meanwhile Katniss is unable or unwilling to learn or grow as a character, but this is keeping in step with every other character. Obvious questions go unconsidered or blatantly ignored. Katniss walks through a fog of her own apathy as the machina lays events at her feet on a trail that her one dimensional character can't help but be blind to
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The author has been interesting to read in past.  On the ereader I have been amazed at the ease of using ereader and enjoying the story, also.  I like the short sentences, no runons.  The descriptions of places are appreciated.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book was very interesting in the beginning.  Having a doctor describe the biological aspects of his illness and near death was fascinating.  But the author's view of God is not one I agree with therefore, I would never recommend this book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|yay this app Is the best. I love it.<br />man that is awesome.<br />I am going in the new year happy.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I am also a history buff and have read endless books about WWII. What makes the book so interesting is the lives of the pilots. The incident itself was short, but the story around it makes the book. I put it right up there with \\"The Forgotton 500\\" This book deserves a 5 star rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was very good book, even after seeing the movie it kept me interested with every twist. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book about adventure, and I look forward to reading the next in the series!
0205313426|5.0|This little book has been extremely helpful to me. It reminds me of the rules that I need to know but have forgotten; it also provides me with terrific examples that show me exactly how the rule works. It has been very helpful in my new job as a beta reader.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very fun interactive game!! Good graphics for an app!! I would recommened this!! My daughter loves playing this more then angry birds lol
B007MDB548|5.0|Kids loved the movie and it makes a great addition to our collection. Now we have all of the tinker bell movies.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I really liked this game. I have yet to purchase the full version but fully intend to. It was fun and kept you guessing.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Was a little worried that this wouldn't be as good at the other Bourne films but there was no need.  Great movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I love Colleen's books, not your average romance! Hopeless is thought-provoking, sad, and funny too! Holder is what every guy should be and I loved him! I read a lot, I mean 3 to 4 books a week so I find grammatical and spelling errors in every book I read and it makes me kind of crazy-I am a little detail oriented. With that said, Hopeless, with the few imperfections is still a perfect read! I highly recommend reading it! I only wished their story wouldn't have ended.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This tutorial seems very helpful if one wants to publish their own project in book form that can be read on a Kindle. That is the important basis of this-to be read on a Kindle. I am considering publishing such a book, but don't have anything ready so I can't speak to how effective the instructions are, only that they made sense. It's not particularly inspiring in a creative sense so I gave it a 4 star because it's just step by step process --which I like, but in today's picture-crazy world, others might find it dry.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|Another great book from Kate Morton!<br />The ending dragged on a bit but was a surprise that was unexpected.<br />It was descriptive, vivid & difficult to put aside.
0887308589|3.0|The start of the book was great, funny & witty, the end became a big of a drag. Worth the read
B00785P2QC|4.0|its near at SIM City. I like it. Its a very cool fand,very funny and not to expencsive. ok, some upgrades needs to be buyed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I always enjoy Tom Clancy's books.  They keep me interested form page one to the very last page!  Keep them coming.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really love it and how you can look at other dictionaries.  This really cool, this is my first tablet so I'm exploring apps.
B008QYT7DI|4.0|The little Prince was an amazing book but it was kind of hard to understand. If you read it slow it's easier to get.
B008764ZQ4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack is a lot of fun.  Of course, the actors are not quite as good as the original singers, but it is still enjoyable.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|This was exactly what she wanted for her birthday, and she was very pleased. She's a big One Direction and Justin Bieber fan, so it went over well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put it down.  This story was so exciting you could not guess where it was going a must read.
0062202081|5.0|I bought this for my daughter. She is a huge Justin Bieber fan. She absolutely loved it, of course...it's about Justin.
B004GTLVIQ|5.0|Great Book, I highly recommend it, but you should read all of the books from start to finish! They are all good in their own way!
B000EUDAWG|5.0|Because I included the necessary batteries with the Tarantula, my 9-year-old nephew was able to play with it immediately, and it kept him occupied for a long time!
B008476HBM|5.0|My resolution is to read more classic literature.  I love this book  so I decided to start with a book I had read a long time ago.  Once I ordered the book, I got it immediately.  The service is exceptional..
B00008G16X|3.0|Unfortunately this vinyl record did not arrive in the condition I thought it would be in. Feel somewhat mislead by condition.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my eleven year old grandson.  He has all the books so far in the series, Matthew anxiously looks forward to each new book that comes out, he absolutely loves these books and there story lines. He strongly recommends this book to other children.
0553801473|4.0|best out of all the books, came quickly and in great condition. Can't wait to see the rest of the tv show
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I really liked all the songs and artists on this CD.<br />Don't know why people were complaining. It is a great CD and worth buying.<br />The songs fit the scenes very nicely.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending! Never saw it coming. Awesome job Suzanne Collins :) this is my favorite book of the hunger games
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Say what you will about the book, but the music of this album is exquisite, bringing some of the most wonderful classics together in one wonderful CD
1401924751|5.0|I have a lot of Oracle Cards Doreen.<br />These cards are very simple, easy to understand for everyone shown us a message with love and guidance.<br />I will also be able to help for myself and others!!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|What a clever writer Dickens was. I was surprised how engaging and approachable the original is after seeing do many TV adaptations. Highly recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked after the first chapter. I read until I finished the whole thing!!! I'm glad I purchased the last book because I will be reading until I'm done!!! Excellent!!!
B000O77SRC|5.0|nice to have another copy of it since my old room mate stole my copy.  it's a great christmas classic. one of my personal favorites.  =)
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This has been my favorite book since I was a child many years ago. When I was younger I was even going to name my children after all the Little Women! However, I had 2 boys so never got the opportunity!
0446530573|5.0|i've tried several of them, and they are delicious.  plus, it has nice little bits to fill in with the show.  it's a great book to have!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Excellent writing about Indian culture and the importance of family. Emphasis on the importance of a mother and how she shapes and holds together a family.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My 10 year old loves these games!  He puts them together in three days and cant wait to play with them!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a good dictionary . You can look for the definition that you won't.I love this dictionary it's really good.
B000IKIN1A|5.0|He created the religion of Bokonon,and I am now a follower.Something was using him as a vessel because Kurt was kind of a jerk as a human being,but boy could he write  interesting books.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great Tom Clancy thriller and how timely! It is totally credible and kept me turning the pages in anticipation.
0316779237|5.0|Who is funnier than David Sedaris? Maybe his sister Amy,but not by very much.Laugh out loud in the library funny.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|That was a  great book I could never finish the book so I was happy I finished that amazing book
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It helps to know the story from previous Bourne films. It was a bit obscure while having lots of action and chases. Entertaining for what it is.
B002PE0HCU|3.0|This was never one of my Hitchcock favorites. I didn't find it all that scary and I disliked the ending.  I like for there to be a point made or a solution or answer at the end of the movie.  Maybe the whole point was that the birds suceeded in driving everyone out, so now the town was their's.  There were a few insights into the people's personality issues, but he didn't seem to follow up on them enough for me.  The main reason I watched it again was because I had just watched &#34;The Girl&#34; which is about what Hedren went thru during the filming of this movie, so I wanted to see the scenes again from that perspective.  All in all, I much prefer Shadow of a Doubt, Marnie, Rear Window, and Dial M for Murder.
B004ATOO0E|5.0|The second season of SGU is 10 times more amazing than season 1.  It really fleshes out the characters and makes the connections that much more believable.  I hated a lot of the boring/annoying characters during the first season, but now they're really likeable(even if you question their judgement at times).  The ending of the second season just SCREAMS for a third! Please! Anyone! Please pick this show back up and get us the THIRD SEASON! SGU 4EVA
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Somewhat of a silly teen love story with some belief suspending twists, turns and roll your eyes coincidences. However, I thought the writing from the girls point of view to be entertaining, particularly in the first half of the book.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|My daughter wanted Friends: The Complete Series for Christmas.  She loves it.  She started from the beginning on Christmas Day.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines was Twin Peaks, Jacobs Ladder, the Truman Show and &#34;I am Legend&#34; all rolled into one page turner. Despite all these other influences, I stayed up late to finish.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love. it because you can get new games and play to get some more money too and this is  fun
B001NLKWLW|3.0|Story line was good albeit a bit predictable. I would say if the author edited at least 1/3 of the book I would have given it more stars. The descriptions and jumping back and forth between characters and times often felt redundant and overly descriptive.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Fans of Jim Butcher will love the series. It isn't quite so dark, though. Kind of refreshing. The humor is great and the pace is quick. I found myself disappointed only by the fact that the book was over. It was also nice that there wasn't so much emphasis on sex as some modern fiction.  It isn't that I have a problem with sex and such.  I'm just not interested in smut novels disguised as SF.  This does have some sexual content, but nothing overbearing.  Hearne strikes a good balance.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This is great for elementary school grade kids to train their mind in critical thinking skills. As an adult it's something to pass the time. I like more difficult puzzles and games with a twist that would really make you think.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a wonderful free app. The higher levels are challenging enough to stump, but not too hard that you easily give up. I enjoy the time trials!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I am a big fan of the resident evil movies. That's why I gave it 5 stars. That being said the story line could be a bit better.<br /><br />Milla is a great action heroine. As with all the actors I felt they did a great job making me feel that I was right there with them. Thank god there was no over done one liners that cheese up any movie when over used. the return of the Red Queen was a good surprise, though not much of a lead in to her appearance.<br /><br />The bad...like many other people have commented all over the web. The first movie really sucks you in but the preceding ones dropped the ball, whether it's bad writing or directing hard to say. Can't really blame the actors since they usually don't have much choice. I was lost in parts of this movie because there were discussions about a new virus (that Rain injected into herself) and who is Ava and why did Wesker suddenly change sides. We as the audience were given a brief explanation and forced to swallow it. I didn't like that. All in all this movie was about a push to answer some questions and set up a final movie while leaving the audience in limbo...expecting a movie and not something that could have been done as a 30 minute straight to DVD rental titled &#34;Resident Evil...Questions answered&#34;.<br /><br />I hope....really hope that the writers and director really go all out on the final movie not only ending the series but making it as good as the first movie, but better. For me, that would let me over look some of the movies that missed the mark.<br /><br />people only remember the first and last movie of a series...if they are great movies.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This film  required absolute focus as the time travel aspects fostered much confusion if you didn't pay attention.<br />Being a fan of this genre, I enjoyed it a lot, in spite of its many twists and turns.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|A bit slow so 1 less star.  Even being slow solved it in a few hours but good for the price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the second book!  Looking forward to starting the third in this series.  Glad my sister recommend reading them....I'm hooked and look forward to seeing the movies.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I gave this a four star instead of five because there was some cheesy parts, but on a whole the book was a fun read. I think if you are in the mood to read a book that makes you laugh, groan, and cheer then this is the book for you.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows and I purchase this for all Holiday/Birthday gifts and everyone loves it.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I cannot finish this book no matter how hard I try. The basic storyline is so sophomoric I felt like I was back in high school. I got about halfway through then skimmed a few more pages wishing something... anything would happen to Sky and holder to end this drivel. I have no idea why it has a warning for 17 and older. I don't think even a 17 year old would find his book even the least bit enticing or true to life.  I guess ive learned a lesson...read a sample before purchasing no matter how highly rated the book is!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show!! Full of drama and dysfunction where nothing ever goes right and when it does, it goes back to wrong right away!.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My favorite movie. I've watched it countless times and laugh endlessly. You have to watch it a couple times to understand or pick up the funniest parts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this booki was invested in the characters and once I started it, could not put the book down! ! Will definitely read other books by this author!!
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|The dancing in this movie was awesome! But some of the plot and scenes were so cheesy it got a little stupid. But overall it was a pretty good movie because of the dancing and creativity with how they danced.
0761163808|5.0|Loved this book when I found it in the store.  Unfortunately the copy there was a little dog-eared so I bought it from Amazon (for less, of course).  Not like the kids book you might expect.  This was a gift for an adult who absolutely loves it.
B001EBV0NU|4.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years. I forgot how many stars were in it. Nicholson is awesome in his dual roles! A young Jack Black appearance is hilarious. This is a forgotten comedy classic.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon A Time Season 2 is wonderful and almost amazing as season 1. It has all the same components, magic, love, mystery, intensity and exc. I will definitely purchase season 2 when it comes out to buy on DVD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|thanks for creating a way to hoard on the internets.<br />this is also super fun to share ideas privately with another friend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It sends me my daily bible verse and you can read the bible.  You can also play sermons they have downloaded for you. I really use this everyday.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|It's a different way of telling Batman's story! I had heard so much about this movie and it didn't let me down. I highly recommend it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game is great, only wish it wasn't all facebooky. And the attention to detail is fantastic. If you are a brony, and patient this is a must buy.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|My daughter has had a lot of fun playing with this. She played for a long time the first time. It is a great quiet time toy.
B009GED3HS|5.0|God, I love this show. I recommend you watch it now, its so funny! Legen - wait for it - dary!<br /><br />I do warn you the season finale is something to be spoken about without giving away too much information.
0385512058|4.0|There are a lot of gold nuggets in this book that you can take away to build up and improve your relationships if you are not good at networking. I am a terrible at it so I picked up this book. I make effort to apply some of the suggestions regularly and I have found that they work such as tracking your relationships and pinging them to keep in touch. I think the ideas are practical and very useful so I am sure you will walk away with some new ideas and techniques to apply in your life.<br /><br />I gave it a four because the book drags a bit and his ego gets in the way sometimes. Also some chapters don't seem relative or just blown to levels that you just can't connect with for example having executive parties at your home and hiring a singer/band so you need to change the situations in your mind to bring it back down to your own life (for now).
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome<br />That is the only thing I can say!
055380684X|5.0|Wonderful book. I learned a lot about what talent really is and how it is created. This book not only helped me to find ways to improve my skills but I can use this information to help improve my child's life. The author did a lot of research and it shows. The book is easy to read and it is one that you can't put down until you finish. He has a great blog that he constantly updates with additional insight. I recommend highly to read this book over a couple times because once is not enough to absorb all the content. There are some other similar books out there and they are just as good to read but I think Daniel's book nails the topic right on.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it was  to hard to understand...kept giving me weather for other places and not in my area couldn't under stand it
B002V091K2|4.0|Something about Picoults writing that always keeps you hoping that the right outcome will happen.... A real page turner ... You will reflect on this long after you read it...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|i don't play this game myself,  my grand children gets on and it keeps them entertained for  many a hours
B0018LMKIK|5.0|It is great.  It brought back so many great memories. I have been wanting this CD for many years. Thanks.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love this book. It was funny and I am going to read the other books too. I also watched the movies.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Does the job I want I like it. I wish it came with a lot more options but you can't have every thing in one package.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Julian Fellowes is absolutely brilliant!  Downton Abbey is a classic, one I will watch over and over through the years.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game regular plays & really great graphics-- fun for everyone. Recommend highly for hours of entertainment.<br />Give it a try.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game may be the funest game that I have ever played!Angry birds is the kind of game that you will not ever get bord with. It is also game that you can play whenever you have nothing to do. Angry birds can be for all ages but the levels may be too hard for little kids. I would recommend this game to anyone
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I don't think words can describe this product!!!!. It is everything i wanted out of a mobile play station. The screen is way better than what i thought as far as resolution and picture and very well built and I was able to fit my regular ps3 since it is only suppossed to be for the slim ps3 and xboxes. Super fast shipping too. This product got to me within 4 days. Seems like they put some thought into this product and very well engineered.  I've had it for about a week now and i pretty much take it whenever i need some entertaining on the spot.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is actually the second case I have bought from Marware, and I truly believe it to be the best case I have found on the market.<br />The reason I gave 4 stars is for 2 reasons:<br />1. The fabric that lays against the screen, over time, gets pilly and raggedy. It doesn't look too bad, but when I compared the new case I bought for my dad compared to my old one (1 year old), you could definitely tell mine was older.<br />2. Since I have had my case for over a year the finish on the hard side of the case is starting to peel off.<br /><br />These are both cosmetic issues and I still think the case is great, and services the purpose of protecting the Kindle.
B002HMHRGE|4.0|First the negative. The digital remaster falls a tad short in dynamics. Find a crisp vinyl copy to really make this science fiction journey really hit the cosmos. The reason this is truly worth your spare change:  the interplay of Jorma Kaukonen and Jerry Garcia on guitars, and Jack Casady playing thunderous bass on,\\"Your Mind Has Left Your Body.\\"  Transcendent to say the least... a reason to listen to psychedelia.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Bought this movie for my child and I wasn't sure what to expect. Awesome movie. The entire family sat down to watch it and we all enjoyed it very much.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Well written short stories.  ONe was a little too simple, which has often bothered me as I have read other short stories.  The other stories were solid in themselves but, as usual with short writings, can't do everything such as a complex plot and complex characters.  I think there was good balance and, most importantly, I was entertained and looked forward to the next quick read while I was on vacation. The stamp of authentic criminal related doings/thinkings was in all the stories, and that was important to me.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Good family film and really has suitable language for all ages.  Great visuals and art.  My 7 yo still likes to watch this.
0451450523|5.0|I gave it five stars because it arrived quickly and didn't have any wear that I noticed. Lovely book, great Christmas present. Thanks a lot!
8866131105|5.0|This is the one gift that is one of the most important for my husband in life and business.  You get a whole page and not just some little square . THe perfect daily Journal that is invaluable.  We are old school. When you write something it stays with you.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is a prefect love story. How a person can love someone beyond your death. Even when you are dead that person Happiness is the most important thing to you. P.S I Love It.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I ordered this on line for my new IPAD I just received for Christmas - hope to have time to read it on IPAD while on vacation or on a train ,plane, etc.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I was only disappointed that there wasn't more to read; that Christopher died before sharing even more of his thoughts.
0060987464|5.0|Another book I couldn't put down, this book blew my mind.  Wow, this guy is seriously out there, but at the same time so normal.  I was moved, disgusted, humored...this book had it all.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|I'm not a fan of the vocal stuff, but the rest is varied, rhythmically and harmonically interesting as always from deadmau5.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love that I don't have to tune to the Weather Channel for my local weather.  Just one touch and I have it.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Good  game. Hidden objects are well drawn and look true to form. Storyline is interesting. A good way to spend some free time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great read hope she writied more books withe the same people  like the mystery part  and would read any book she would write
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Such a suspenseful story! A great read for those that enjoy a little mystery! You will really enjoy this book!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is addictive! The movie is incomparable with the novel because it lacks so much detail that was presented in the novel. I definitely will read them over again.
0593065700|5.0|Lee Child keeps you interested in the story from the time you open the cover to the end of the book. Its a book that you just can't put down.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|I have a Russian Blue and I was attracted by the cartoon cat in the book so I bought the kindle version. The book has no content and it doesn't seem like it was written by someone who ever had a cat. It took me about 15 minutes to finish the book and I had no other feelings except that I have just wasted $8 and 15 mins of my time.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I have never seen it, but I bought it for  my grandson for a Christmas gift per his request. He is a big fan of the batman movies. He enjoyed it.
B0025TOH5S|5.0|We downloaded this with the new program onto my son's iPAD and it is great.  Much more reasonable priced and you get it quickly.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Funny movie to share with the family every holiday season! It's a classic as many know.<br />After years & years I finally decided to buy it! :-)
0671027344|1.0|This book is easy to read because of the letter format its in. Its basically about Charlie (the main character) writing letters to a stranger (who we never find out the identity of). I kept reading because I thought it was going to get better. It didnt. 15 year olds do not talk like this and i'm pretty sure every 15 year old boy knows what \\"masturbation\\" is. I get that he is smart but it sounds like a mix of a 6 year old and a 60 year old talking.The book is just badly written in a literary sense. Reviewers that claimed this is the best book they have ever read obviously need to read more. The movie however is great which is odd because i've never read a book in which the movie is better. So forget the book get this on DVD!
B0027DJ87O|5.0|An excellent album chocked full of great songs - done live.  A must buy for Morissette fans and others.  Hopefully my neighbors like it as well...
0670026603|5.0|Love every minute of this book. I found myself going to bed early so I could continue reading. Highly recommmend it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is fun when your bored or any other time. This game is really addictive. I have played this game for a long time now. My friend showed this game to me I think a year ago and I have played it Denver.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love this case.  I take it everywhere.  It allows me to read or play games on my Kindle Fire HD in Portrait or Landscape mode.  And it protects my Kindle from injury if I accidentally drop it.  I have the Purple color which is very beautiful.  This is by far the best Kindle cover I've ever owned.
B008469DGY|3.0|it's okay , gets kind of boring playing all par three's , wish I would of notised that little fact befor I purchased it .
1476719071|5.0|I was on the line about buying this book as some had stated it being a bad example, and... well, see for yourself. and the description made it out to seem silly. I'm glad i went with my gut and read it. I think it is close enough yet far enough away from a real life liklihood of a relationship that makes is readable. I in no way think that it insinuates what kind of relationship anyone should have or find acceptable. I read for pleasure and this was a captivating, alluring read that really kept my attention (finished it in one stretch and I have 2 little ones) Its in my top 3 reads and i CANT WAIT for the sequel and hope it matches and surpasses the first book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Very good game one oaf the best I've played always something new in the game . Would recommend it to everybody
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A sweet, and funny at times, book.  Written in the vernacular so for those that like to really get the flavour of a place, this is it.
0345536886|5.0|all his novels are great can not wait to read it, John Grisham has an interesting way of looking all things legal
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Absolutely awesome. My wife and I had caught this on PBS and we would find ourselves stopping to watch it whenever it was on. Alfie Boe has an awesome voice and captures the pain of Jean ValJean. Lea Salonga has such a pure voice that it just tears at you and Samantha Barks as Eponine, well, that's as great as it get's. My wife has gone to see the play on Broadway and said that I should see it. I'm not much for musicals, but the melodies wind through the story just bring you along. This is a concert performance at the O2 in London and it amazes me that the performers convey the feeling of the play, while standing at the mics. Joe Jonas (as Marius), has a voice that's not up to the strength of the veteran stage performers, but really puts his all into &#34; Empty Chairs and Empty Tables&#34;. Norm Lewis as Javert conveys the rigid moral character that epitomizes the character. If you get this, make sure you watch at the end where all four performers who have played Jean ValJean perform together, it's freaking amazing. Last but not least, Matt Lucas and Jenny Galloway are wicked as the Thenardier's.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I found the quality of the DVD's to be excellent, both the audio and the visual. I have watched each episode of Castle several times, beginning with season one. My favorites are seasons three and four. This is classified as a crime drama, but, with the bit of humor and the quirky characters, it makes ther stories a little lighter than a 'regular' cop show, without being offensive or insensitive. There are some episodes that are more serious and a bit darker, but I enjoyed all quite a lot. The acting is great, as well as the writing. I recommend, not only the third season, but all four seasons which are available right now. Season five I'm sure will be available as soon as it's done being shown.
034580404X|5.0|I read all the books in a week. Amazing. Will be reading them again.  I really loved the story more than anything else. Just a really great romantic novel.
1932100660|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in nutrition.  It's an eye-opener.  It will certainly cause the reader to make changes in his/her diet.
B0089XH38M|4.0|never had any bad things to say about AVG, and was thrilled to get it for my Android phone.  Keep up the good work
1574216988|3.0|Zentangles are a great way to express creativity and the adding of Yoga for the Brain through them is fun.
B00884GR0W|4.0|really like this game...really.  but it is a little difficult to traverse the terrain on my samsung galaxy siii and I will probably end up deleting it.  maybe get it for PC though?  hmmmmm
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app works as advertised.  It is quick and easy to use and does what it says it will do.  I have had it for over a week and am very pleased with it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The lineup of actors and actresses can't be more appropriate; they all seemed so natural in their roles. Any<br />film that features Maggie Smith and Judy Dench, is a winner. To me this would be the adventure of a lifetime;<br />one of those vacations for laid back personalities who are able to handle the most adverse conditions, coming<br />along in a very unexpected way. This is definitely not a uxury vacation in any tangible respect. However, this<br />movie is rich in the development of unique personal relationships. The pace of the movie is like a leisurely<br />elephant walk thru a jungle path. Personally, I wish that I had the guts to take such a vacation. I highly recommend<br />this movie for those folks with adventure in their hearts and an appreciation for taking time to smell the roses.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The movie was okay, but after watching the previous movie 'The Dark Knight', it just was not as good in my opinion, mostly because the action was not that good and the previous film also started out very exciting and held your attention from the beginning. I would still recommend though!
B009X01FJS|2.0|I needed a new case for my Kindle Fire (8.9&#34;), so I chose this one due to the positive reviews.<br /><br />I would give it five stars except there is one poor design feature that impacts my use - when using my Kindle in landscape mode, the Kindle is positioned so the power jack is on the bottom. This means you cannot watch it in landscape while it is being charged since there is not enough room for the powercable. I had previously purchased a case from another manufacturer, and had the same problem - I'd hoped it was not the case in the Marware, but it is. There are two things I tried to resolve this:<br /><br />1. Rotating the Kindle in the case to where the jack is at the top. Unfortunately, then the tab that holds the case upright is gone, and the Kindle and case will just fall flat.<br />2. Place the Kindle in the case upside down so the jack is on top. But then the speakers are covered and the sound is muffled.<br /><br />In addition, I agree with other reviewers that the Kindle does not feel secure in the case, and it will flop over unexpectedly.<br /><br />For such a pricey case, I expected more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had never heard of this author or book before, but I love to try new authors (especially with such a low price for all 5 short stories). The other reviews were excellent, so it was a pretty low risk. I literally was unable to stop reading this book. I think I read the entire thing in well under a week and thought about the characters while I wasn't reading.<br />Like many sci-fi (type) books, Wool sort of starts in the middle of the story and the reader has to glean clues from the text about the backstory and how this group of people got there. Fortunately, Howey did an excellent job of providing enough of that backstory so I never felt lost or confused, but still withheld enough that I had to get to the next chapter to find out more.<br />Highly recommended!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book was chosen by my blog readers as the most important next book for me to read. Their decision just proved I need to do this more often-- they were more than right.<br /><br />Cinder by Marissa Meyer is about a cyborg, Cinder, who lives in a futuristic China. In a breathtaking and most unique retelling of the Cinderella story, we are introduced to a world of technology and wonder-- in addition to governmental intrigue, and another dominating species, the Lunars. Prince Kai meets our Cinder very early on in the story to ask her help in repairing his android, and it becomes clear that he may have to marry the evil Queen Levana to avoid all out war with the Lunars. While some of the aspects of the story are similar (evil stepmother and a ball), most of it is not, and it enthralled me from start to finish.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver, the best selling author of the Delirium series, told me in an interview that this was her favorite YA read of the year. I know now why. The world building is terrific and I kept wanting to see more. The characters are very interesting, and the ethical dilemma of what makes a human kept cropping up in subtle but interesting ways. Furthermore, the protagonist was wonderful-- Cinder is probably the antithesis of the typical Cinderella image, but that's part of her charm. I loved that she was a mechanic and that she was down and dirty working on electronics-- that she wasn't the typical heroine.<br /><br />I wasn't surprised by the big reveal, because hints were placed early on, and I can't still figure out why a certain doctor didn't reveal more earlier on, except as merely a plot device, but that was my only qualm.<br /><br />Overall, a terrific and unusual retelling of the Cinderella story in futuristic China-- well written with wonderful characters. Meyer is an author to watch.
0307730697|4.0|Adam Brown gave his life for the country he loved on March 17, 2010 in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan.  This book traces the story of his life and his incredible journey from being a crack addict with 11 felonies to becoming a member of the elite Navy Team SIX, a loving husband and father, and a devoted Christian.<br /><br />This is a little out of step with my normal reading genres.  However, it is not completely foreign territory.  I've read a few military biographies and fiction stories over the years.  And, whenever possible, my husband wrangles me into watch a documentary with him.  So, I pushed aside my theology books, reached across Jane Austin and grabbed my Kindle to read Fearless.<br /><br />It started out a little slow, going all the way back to his parents' childhoods.  But, if you are patient, the story line does pick up.  And the writing probably won't wow you.  It reminded me of reading a newspaper that quoted a lot of sources.  However, despite those detriments, this is an amazing story.  A story that had me sobbing at the end.  Which is annoying, because it is really hard to read and cry.<br /><br />So, what was so amazing about this book?  It was amazing that the transforming power of Christ was seen in his life as he went from a crack cocaine addict to a Navy SEAL.  It is amazing that he endured so many injuries and yet continued to do his job.  It is amazing that he truly seemed to have no fear.  Those things are all amazing.<br /><br />But, I think what is most amazing is this....the story of Adam Brown puts flesh and bones on the military.  We see through their eyes.  It highlights their humanity and the sacrifice that they have made for our country.  After ten plus years of military action in Iraq and Afghanistan we have become dulled to what we see on the news.  I have become dulled.  Soldiers loss their lives.  I see it.  It's sad.  And then I go on with my day.  This book depicts the soldier as a person.  A person with past, a person with struggles, a person with love ones who mourn the loss of his life.  I think those things are important to reflect upon.<br /><br />So, would a recommend this book?  Yes, but a qualified yes.  Even though this is published by a Christian publisher there is still profanity in it.  Not a ton, but when a SEAL is quoted it is not edited.  For this reason, I would only recommend this to adults.<br /><br />I received this Kindle book free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers in exchange for an honest review.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love to love the characters I like, and love to hate the ones I don't like.  Just wish the &#34;season&#34; lasted longer.

0812993357|5.0|I never saw The September issue- I left Vogue behind about 3 years ago when I felt they became too elite for my tastes-but I love Grace Coddington. She's a wonderful narrator and, after 50+ years in fashion, has a lot to say. Most of it is a mix of her personal life (born in Wales, she became a model and worked for some top photographers), fashion and photographers, and the models, writers and celebs she has worked with on shoots. She's an engaging narrator and, while never going into too much detail about her emotions, you get a sense of her life and her accomplishments and what all this meant to her-it's am impressive body of work. If you're interested in Anna Wintour, great, because she's frequently mentioned. But the charm of the book is the handsketched drawings and witty chapter descriptions-and the love she shows for cats and her pride at her styling and editing. Many of the photographers and photo shoots she mentions are displayed in the book, along with credits, which was a great addition to the behind-the-scene details. This took longer to read than I expected, and, I think it helps to have a knowledge of fashion, but was a pleasure.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I recently started watching the Big Bang theory on tv and I'm a few seasons behind. I bought season one that came with blu ray, DVD, and ultraviolet all in one. I am able to watch every episode on my computer, IPhone, and blu ray player, it convenient to be able to watch episode wherever you want. This was a great buy at a great price for me.

0865479410|4.0|I can think of several reasons for readers to purchase and read Oliver Burkeman's The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking. If you hate self-help books and the Pollyanna approach found in many of them, this book takes a different path that you're likely to enjoy. Burkeman writes in a way that will engage and entertain most readers. After you've read it, you'll think of at least one unbalanced optimist to whom you will present a copy of this book with special glee. Finally, if you love self-help books, you need to read this one to round out or balance what you've been getting from other authors. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and found that Burkeman's way of connecting his perspective with threads of classic philosophical thinking made me reflect on happiness in a broader way.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game. lot like Mario brothers. super easy to play but the controls take a little getting use to especially on the kindle fire because of the width of the scree

I am a woman in my 50's. My teen DAUGHTERS also clamor for this book and this series. They have loved it since they were early teens and it was the only book left at the beach that they hadn't read. BUY IT!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like looking up new projects to do and explore new recipes to fix. This app is very helpful and I would recommend it to anyone.
0425252868|5.0|Could not put the book down for more than a minute and finished. I am impressed with the entire book, from cover to cover.<br />I recommend this to anyone.
B001EN71CW|5.0|With prime membership how can you not buy this?  Firefly should be brought back....what a great series.  Get the movie as well.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|I bought the  ION Profile turntable before Christmas so I could convert some old records from my wife's family to MP3 format.  The info about this device indicates that it can be used to convert 33, 45, and 78 RPM discs to MP3.  That is true (sort of).  For 78's you have to run them on the turntable at 33 or 45 rpm to record them into Audacity.  This process is VERY SLOW!  After recording into Audacity you can edit out clicks, and adjust Bass, and simulate the correct playback speed.  It works, but is time consuming.  Each side of a 78 took me about 20-30 minutes to get it sounding right.  With a whole box full of 78's it took me several days to convert them all!  I also recorded a single 33 rpm album. and a few 45's at normal speed and had no problems at all.  If you are using it for just 33 and 45 rpm conversions it will probably be fine, but if doing more than a couple of 78's I would suggest a model designed to play 78's at their native speed.<br /><br />I also ran into the problem with the tone arm.  After recording, the arm moved back to the rest position, shut off, then turned back on again.  It repeated this action until I manually moved it back to the center, then back to the rest position.
B008MEM24S|5.0|my kids and i play all the time. good learning and makes you really think. i hope they make more games like this
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading the Wheel of Time for over 15 years.  Having an ending to such a monumental (and personally important story) that didn't dissapoint was a tall order ... and Jordan/Sanderson accomplished this.  In my mind there can be no higher praise for this book than this.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wonderful movie!  This was a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter.  We watch it at least once a week.  Tear jerker though!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B004NELBPC|4.0|I check in with the Huffington Post every day via this app. Comprehensive and concise is the best way to describe the Huffington Post. Progressive point of view on political matters with well written commentary by thoughtful pundits. Complete news involving science, entertainment, world news and much more. Highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It was a strong ending to an exciting trilogy.<br />Sorry Mr. Larsson is no longer with us to weave such elaborate conspiracy tales.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Very good book in terms of pace. Author has a great way of pulling you in and making you associate with the characters in a manner that brings you so close to them. I would go to sleep trying to figure out hoe Katniss would get out of a certain dilemma? Who should she choose Gale or Peers. Excellent not as great as the first but a great read nonetheless.  The story does feel oddly familiar.  Now to start the third.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose this book as it was recommended by many friends. I actually saw the movie in theaters but wanted the part of the story which was left out. I enjoyed  it and was pulled into the story.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B005BY3XHC|4.0|Enjoyed this book and several of the concepts are almost common sense to a religious person I found. Sometimes one simply needs a reminder or different perspective.<br />This doesn't mean that you need to be religious to read or appreciate the concepts explained in this book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy. It was like watching a great movie. Becoming vested in the lives of the characters. Judging the actions of a character until later learning it is as a result of their past that they act this way.<br />I love how it's fiction but could very easily be non-fiction.  The author touches on many poignant topics in a very riveting and enchanting manner.<br /><br />Lastly, the Hunger Games movie and book was recommended by friends when the movie came out. So I saw the movie and became curious of the story knowing there is always more to the story than what is portrayed on the big screen. seeing the slight dissatisfaction of the storybook fans.<br /><br />All that to say I am very glad I decided to read all three books. I would find myself thinking what else can happen to Katniss or who will she choose as a husband Gale or Peeta. I think it was a good ending and a great trilogy.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app! Easy to play, lots of different levels and hours of fun! As of now, no problems with this app!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I chose this rating because I don't think it is right to hurt other people for pleasure. I was hoping to find out what caused his eating disorder and if she would have the courage to walk away.
160774273X|4.0|It's a good cookbook if you want to make &#34;any&#34; kind of bread. You won't go wrong with this book if you're looking for bread.
B00867GHS8|4.0|One of the best Pixar's movies and full of contents. Maybe the 3D edition is not as good as other movies, but It's enough for me
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim after I saw Christina perform live with CeeLo on The Voice.  The song, \\"Make the World Move\\" just captivated me. I really loved the song.  It motivated me to listen to all of the samples on the whole album.  The samples were good, but each song in it's entirety is even better.  All of the songs are good, but most of the songs are fantastic!  This CD received a lot of mixed reviews when it first came out. And that held me back from buying it sooner.  But as of right now I see that this CD has finally averaged out to 4 1/2 stars on Amazon and I think that is very fair and accurate.  I have liked a few songs here and there throughout Christina's career, but never have I been motivated to buy one until now.  And I'm so glad I did.  She is truly gifted - there's just not another Christina. Even my two-year-old knows her when he hears her.  Definitely a good buy!<br /><br />The BEST Songs on the CD:<br />Lotus Intro<br />Red Hot Kinda Love<br />Let There Be Love<br />Circles<br />Best of Me<br />Make the World Move<br /><br />REALLY GOOD Songs on the CD:<br />Army of Me<br />Your Body<br />Sing for Me<br />Cease Fire<br />Around the World<br />Just a Fool<br /><br />Much Better than Average, but not a stand-out:<br />Blank Page
B008JEJPSC|5.0|I'd forgotten how terrific a movie this is.  Great music and wonderful characters.  A cast at their peak.  Don't miss this musical.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|lots of fun and also challenging. looks great on the kindlewould recommend for anyone including your grandchildren who would probably beat youJuly
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It is so magical and mysterious! I'm excited to read something else by Kate Morton.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very easy read yet interesting. Being in my mid-20's I would surely say the book is aimed for a younger audience (I knew that when I purchased it). I also loved the pictures that were included in the book. Reading it on the kindle made it a little hard to see the pictures and the letters but were still clear enough to read. I would definitely recommend reading this book.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|This product does not fit the Kindle Fire HD 7\\". Please do not buy this for your Kindle fire HD 7\\" even though it says it fits it. i do not know why they would have said it fits.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love breaking bad, Walking dead, parenthood, 30 rock.... And i love this show too! I watch it from amazon using my Ruku and the streaming never gets interrupted (however alot of that has to do with your internet connection).<br /><br />Great show, Love amazon instant video.
B008D30K7E|5.0|I loved this book! The mix of history and fiction told through the eyes  of Allen was such a joy to read. And very funny!<br />If you enjoy a good story about an average man this is for you!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a great book.have to keep turning pages non stop. Great read.possibly the best I have ever read in my life.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is by far the best show and I can't wait for the season 2 to come out so I can get that too.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I liked everything about this game, except the small detail of not knowing exactly what is in your inventory. When you touch the item, it &quot;should&quot; give you a name so you're not guessing but it doesn't. Other than that, loved it!!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Absolutely not as advertised - will not plug into Kindle Fire HD.  Highly disappointed in this product and the false claims on the compatibility.  BUYER BEWARE!
B0091ICDHU|5.0|THE STORY OF LAKE AND WILL AND THEIR BOYS WAS SO HEART WRENCHING. THIS WAS EVEN BETTER WHEN THERE IS A FOLLOW UP BOOK OF THE SAME STORY. I STILL DID NOT WANT THIS TO END .I WILL WAIT UNTIL THERE IS ANOTHER BOOK AND BE FIRST IN LINE. THANKS ALOT TO THE AMAZING AUTHOR.WOW IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS BOOK.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|I love this movie so much. This blu ray package is also awesome. The video quality of Frankenweenie on blu ray is breathtaking. The blacks and the whites are so clear it is very easy to get sucked into the environment that this film creates. As for the film itself, I love it. It has a old time monster movie film. I would definitely recommend this film to any monster movie fans. Not sure if it is great for kids. May be a little scary for the little ones....maybe not. I am writing this from a adult movie viewer prospective. So if you are in the mood for a throwback monster movie with style definitely check out Frankenweenie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had not read a book for ages and I heard about Kindle so I decided to buy a book.Wow was I taken with this book .It was so good I found it hard to stop reading, This author has that special something that sucks you in to the story and holds you there.I immediately went looking for her other books.I am a fan for life. Thanks for writing this.
1118109791|5.0|Study, study, study as much as you can!  It's the best source to get ready for the GMAT, but make sure you get other materials as well to learn all of the concepts.
B00004WPFX|1.0|Bought it twice, both were defective!  Don't buy this item!  Both skipped on front and back in exactly the same place on one of the discs.  Looks like this was a bad pressing.
0891419063|5.0|As E.B. Sledge takes you from his collegiate days in pre WWI Alabama through enlistment, boot camp and into battle, his writing style changes from sophomore innocence to Marine Corps  boot to combat soldier.  His word pictures have you rubbing sand and sweat and tears from your face.  His 1,000 yard stare down with the 'shave-tail' is a one of the few parts that will allow you to smile, or sigh with relief for a few minutes, knowing that they men he fought with did not have many opportunities to relax, breathe easily or escape the cannonade and screams of death and dying.
B008C20TDG|5.0|The best book to understand your own body... and to begin to do the correct for it. Satisfaction absolutely assured.
6304711905|5.0|I have been told by people who know him that Val Kilmer is one of the most difficult people in show business. That said, his work as Doc Holiday in Tombstone has to be called brilliant. It was nearly half way through my first viewing that I realized who he was.I'd be willing to bet that were he not so disliked in Hollywood, Kilmer would have been nominated for an Academy Award. Overall a great, interesting and captivating telling of the Wyatt Earp story and in my opinion, far better than the Kevin Costner version that came out about the same time.
B004CAWSKE|4.0|I've only listened to this album once so far, but I think it is not quite as good as Lucidity but still a good album. I find the music easy to listen to and it's really nice to have female-led heavy music (what is this genre called anyway? I like it, but I don't know how to identify it...symphonic hard rock??). I like a lot of the different male-led bands but as a female myself, it's sometimes nice to get another perspective, and the range happens to be one that I can sing along with without straining; so that's another bonus.<br /><br />Yes, I enjoyed the album and I look forward to listening to it many more times.
0375842209|5.0|No review could do this book justice. Markus Zusak has an amazing ability of description that uniquely describes characters and events, adding depth and insight at every turn. I have never read a book that looked at the world and described it in such a unique way while giving the reader confidence that the inspired image is exactly right. Like another reviewer, I cried during the prologue. Absolutely one of my favorite books for topic, plot, and writing style. Read it!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My grandson got a NABI for Christmas and down loaded this app. for him and he just loves putting the puzzles together.  It loves the train puzzles the best.<br /><br />Would recommend this app.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The beautiful quality and picture associated in this series is amazing and well worth the buy! I love this package and would recommend everyone own the series!
1400049628|4.0|We are 'Walking Dead' fans, For Christmas this year as a fun gift, I made up a Zombie survival kit. I thought it would be a campy, silly little thing to include in the kit, and indeed it is! It was a smashing success. But imagine my surprise when I opened the book and discovered that it actually contained some sage advice for 'after the lights go out.'<br /><br />I can't pretend it is a 'must have' book for everyone's library. But if you have any reason whatsoever to be searching for this book, then it is a good bet you should get it!
B009LHWEKW|5.0|One of the greatest shows I have ever watched. Totally worth buying it and catching up before the season picks up tonight!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I finished this book in a 24 hour period.  I had trouble putting it down.  For me, the plausible story of the dangers, problems and challenges of travel to Mars was very compelling.  I thoroughly enjoyed the description of engineering solutions required for the main characters survival on Mars.  I really liked the cast of characters and their attitudes and personalities and could identify with all of them.  Maybe because I'm a geek, but this is the kind of science fiction I like.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She wrote this book so well it's just awesome. Suzanne makes it where the feelings that Katniss had feels like your there and experiencing it firsthand. She wrote this book amazingly to where I can't tell if what I'm reading is really happening to me or not.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my friend brought his ipod in with this on it and he kept asking for it back but he never got it. back.  also if u have a camera on your ipod get id cap that 18 and up
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I'm not necessarily the type of person to read the synopsis of what a book might be about before reading the book itself and this is one of those times. I knew it was a sort of love story and that was enough to make me buy it, but when I got halfway through, the plot started to turn into something entirely different and it was a GREAT surprise! Loved this book and have already recommended it. Well written and a nice, fast read.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great...but every once in awhile an ad for star wars comes up. Dislike that. Please remove. I know it exists and when you fix the pricing issue I will buy it for my Kindle but for now I will enjoy all of it for free on my Android phone. Come on Amazon...you can do better
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book, I couldn't wait to get to the third book. I loved this trilogy and can't wait for the movies to come.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|One thing for sure:  when Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up for a movie, the final product is deeply disturbing.  Scorsese is a genius at presenting haunting images, while Leo is a natural for playing troubled characters with loads of baggage; accordingly the pair excels at creepiness in the blunt thriller SHUTTER ISLAND, a dark tale that will definitely have you peeking under the bed before turning out the lights.<br /><br />A female inmate escapes from SHUTTER ISLAND, the home of a hospital for the criminally insane.  Two G-men (DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the escape, and from the get-go, the viewer immediately ascertains that something at this eerie place is horribly awry.  Whether it's the pro-lobotomy antics of the hospital's administrators (Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow), or the dark, damp creepiness of the maximum security block, or the goosebumps-inducing machinations taking place inside an isolated lighthouse--or the mind-bending flashbacks of DiCaprio's character, everything lends itself to an overwhelming sense of disturbia.  Suffice it to say DiCaprio's Detective Teddy Daniels is not the man he thinks he is, and the plot device that springs this snippet rings a bit hollow, yet it's still must-see viewing.  Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch, and Patricia Clarkson each enhance a stellar cast, while Scorsese and DiCaprio aptly tweak the \\"ick\\" factor in a subtle, carefully-nuanced manner.  SHUTTER ISLAND may induce nightmares, yet it's a dark journey worth taking.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B008XG1X18|4.0|what can i say its a fun way to get great ideas and kill some time. i have gotten tons of great ideas
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of the very best books I have ever read on Kindle.  I will purchase  hard cover version for birthday gifts.  Jon Parkinson.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I got this app just a few hours ago and now I can't access to the video camera. Every time I try to click on it, it says &quot;MyCamera has stopped.&quot; I have never encountered these much problems on an app as much as I did with this one! Waste of money!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Another Ang Lee masterpiece! With the fabulous 3D, I felt like I was there!  I believe it is a story about the necessity of coming to terms with our inner tiger--we can't live without it (survival instincts, ambition, drive) but we can't allow it to devour us either (greed, violence,agression). To me, \\"The Life of Pi\\" is a modern fairytale--not necessarily true in outer, physical reality butvery true in \\"inner\\", psychological reality. The animation was so good, I could never really tell when the tiger was real or animated. The film is paced just right--never slow or rushed. The colors are gorgeous and rich and photography is sensational.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A very unusual book, bizarre would be a good description of some parts, maybe I just didn't get it?  Although it had me intrigued enough to finish it :o)
1451648537|5.0|I just started reading the book and It is very inspiring.<br />Too bad that Steve Jobs died so young. He is indeed<br />A GENIUS!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A friend said this was the best and cheapest read ever, and he reads a ton of fantasy books. Would have to agree -  can't wait for book two.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Cute, funny, great characters. Each had issues to deal with from past relationships, but come to recognize true love is out there!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I am an introvert so what it has to say is very interesting to me.  It was recommended by a friend and she was right on for me and for her.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|great story and totally original. sure time travel movies always have holes, but this was really great with a story that makes you pause, which guy are you rooting for?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book due to all the hype. Luckily, I changed my mind. What a great read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This story was so magical and atmospheric that I am still savoring the memory before I move on to another book. I loved the characters and the descriptions. Not predictable. Excellent!
1439152802|4.0|I am  generally not a mystery fan., but got into this one and thoroughly enjoyed it!<br />Nicely developed characters and plot.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|it is a fun game but the physics don't always make sense. warning: if you have big fingers and you're<br /> playing on a touch screen then you are in for a lot of frustration.
B00A856U7O|5.0|lovely<br />wonderful<br />kind<br /><br />Disc with wonderful romantic songs. Impossible not to love.<br />What are you waiting for? Buy yours now.

B00136JS12|5.0|It's Boston and it's one of their greatest albums. A must buy for any classic rock fan! Not a bad cut on the whole disc.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is my first Harry Bosch novel and i will definitely be reading more.  My only skepticism comes from the many coincidences and hunches that seem to work in Harry's favor.  But for sure a good entertaining read.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|This movie belongs in the garbage... however, it's saving grace is an absolutely PHENOMENAL soundtrack. The creativity and arrangements of some of the 80's best songs brings the movie to life. Definitely worth watching at least once. We're not gonna take it / We built this city says it all :-)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book \\"The Mark of Athena\\" is another fantastical book in the Percy Jackson series includes Fascinating Greek myths, modern technology, and exciting twists.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Each book is a fantastic journey on its own but to have all five in one convenient package is really amazing. I would recommend these books to anyone who likes to read, and maybe  even those that don't. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride from page one to the end. (Hopefully book five is not the end.)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a pretty good book, it is fast paced. You really do not expect the end. I truly recommend it.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|My grandsons like this movie... they are ages 3 and 5. But there are a few parts that scared them...
B004EI2NM2|5.0|Not the best and a little adward. Not as good or true as last tango in paris. Might want to also check out high art. Be good
B003QTSMXE|4.0|My grandsons have seen this at least 100 times! I enjoy it too :-) It never seems to get old.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|Cannot believe the amount of nudity in this TV series.  No thank you!<br />My husband and I weree both offended by it.  Too bad because we really like the main actor.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|its a really fun game. I love how you can zoom In and out. they did a great job on the graphics of the game!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish. It is an engaging love story with lots of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. Holder and Sky are incredible characters that will stick with you long after you finish this book. I'd highly recommend.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|This movie had the worst everything! and some how accomplished it with  alot of good talent and a great director. Not a good movie in my eyes im a little shocked at oliver on this one!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book as so well done. I  was hooked from page one. I didn't want it to end. Highly recommend!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love it so much I'm buying the next one.<br />But it's sad and scary but I'm happy that the person I wants to win did so happy hunger games!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is a great movie!  Sandra Bullock won an academy award and she deserved it.  I always cry happy tears when I watch it and it has always been said, &#34;If Bettine cries, it's a good movie.&#34;  I would recommend this to all viewers, especially football fans. I thought I had this in my movie library but couldn't find it so streaming it from Amazon at a very reasonable price was so easy and played well on my TV.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love it, but I hate it.  I hate to love it.  It is my most favorite game, but I hate that I am a 35 year old woman who wants to play angry birds more than my kids.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My husband and I decided we wanted to get into the fun of Downton Abbey and have been zipping through Series 1 and 2.  We will most likely finish before season 3 ends on TV.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy facebook, but definitely enjoy it even more on my kindle.  I like facebook because I can do when I want.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is fun and funny.  Even if you can only draw stick figures you will enjoy this game.  I recommend it to everyone.  Loads of fun for children
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun even my daughter can play. I just wish you got coins faster. Other than that I have no  problems
B005HSG3VK|5.0|We bought this cover for our child to cover the Kindle we had gotten her.  This cover is very sturdy and is simple enough not to frustrate.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Dear friend,<br /><br />This book encompasses everything about being different, good and bad. It will change my life forever.<br /><br />Love always,<br /><br />Lee
B002ZG99CM|1.0|I ordered the dvd/ blueray combo for my son for an early birthday present. When we received it it was only the blueray copy there was no DVD included like is was suppossed to. I would have returned it if my son wasn't so excited but I'm very disappointed that it's advertised as a combo set and you only get one of the discs that are promised.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. Wonderful detail. Sad to see that this would could be this way. Our government has so much control now.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was pretty good except for a lot of repetition. I found myself rolling my eyes at some parts. All in all it was good but I would have changed some things.
B009O2XY12|4.0|It's engrossing..one can spend lots of time trying to &#34;beat the system&#34; !<br />I found it enjoyable and easy to think that the next click would make me a winner.<br />Defintely a good game to try.
1401324649|3.0|I see there are over 300 reviews on this book so will make mine short.<br /><br />The plot is as per the book description.Old guy disappears from the old folks home and steals a suitcase with valuable contents, falls in with some<br />strange characters etc. Threaded through the present narrative are chapters from Allan's amazing unbelievable life.<br /><br />Once I started reading,I thought i had bought a kids book in error.<br />The writing style is unusual and rambles along with florid descriptions of irrelevant things.<br />i love black humour, and some of the content is dark, but not particularly funny.<br />The idea is interesting and it almost works.Almost. Towards the end I found myself wanting to finish it so I could read something else.<br /><br />If you suspend the rational side of your brain and just jump into the book and go with the story it is an OK read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple solitare game, works well on my tablet and ads aren't intrusive to game play. Would recommend this app to anyone
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Well written first person witness of the battles that our fathers and grandfathers went through. This is a book that breaks down the daily heartache as well as adversity they went through. Having a bad day? Read this and realize what a truly bad day is.
0345803485|1.0|Still waiting for the good part in the book. And I finished reading it. The same thoughts from my wife, she said NOT to buy the other books.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this story and the characters...couldn't put it down! You know how it's going to end but it's so fun getting there!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|YOU WILL LOVE THIS! It's like you're watching a scary movie but it has an amazing story and plot that lasts much longer than 2 hours. The end is really.. just.. wow.

B00846TRHY|4.0|Based on a true story, this movie will hold your interest. It is action packed, well acted and was worth the money.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I liked this movie.. perfect for a lazy sunday morning.<br />Good plot and great animation as can be expected from Disney Pixar.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Clare Danes is a bit dramatic at times, but shines in this series. The only negative is the nudity which makes it unsuitable for kids. I was surprised too see boobs on what I thought was a regular evening cable channel.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After obsessively reading the book one weekend I NEEDED to see the movie. I don't know why I was surprised when the movie fell short, as is often the case with book to screen interpretations. The streaming was a little rocky, pixeling out during fast action sequences. BUT, it was available for instant play and at 10 dollars cheaper than buying it via itune/appleTV, so I appreciate the instant gratification none the less, let alone a more appealing $$.
B0095R6OBS|1.0|Can I have my 30 minutes back? This movie was pretty crappy and I wouldn't recommend it. Save your $
B001HN6918|1.0|This movie thinks it's cute, but when the 'bad guy' taunts kung fu panda by telling him that he is adopted because he's real parents didn't want him and such, it gave my daughter nightmares. For a WEEK, my daughter was scared that if she did anything wrong that I would give her away. Overall, a really crappy thing to be put in a children's movie. boo
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While there are many gruesome scenes, the story line and plot twists will keep you glued to the set and coming back for more.
0762777931|5.0|Wow this is a great book! This is not a diet book but a book for people trying to make some healthy lifestyle changes. I bought this along with the Crazy Sexy Kitchen and highly recommend both books.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Excellent!  Donald Fagen fans won't be disappointed.  Don't expect a Steely Dan album.  Nice quality sound and production as you would expect from a studio master like Fagen.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My 4, 6, and 8 year-old nieces love this movie, as do I!!! The theme is so classic and the storyline is truly beautiful-such a family film and I highly recommend it for any one with little girls...or boys, too. :)
B004PAHZMC|4.0|It goes great with the star wars theme of the playroom. Holds all the legos and is durable enough to be filled to the top.
B001J53X9U|4.0|Great!!! Nothing to say, just Great!!! Beautiful Batpod & very good movie.  Like this movie very much! Support support support!!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|it is very good, I bought it for my friend and she loves it very much and the shipment is very fast
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book. Well written, kept me read reading, but I was able to make predictions halfway through which is frustrating to me.  I like to be tricked, to make my mind think.  Overall an ok book.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I give this app a five star fruits up. Anyone up for some fruit salad?  Ninjas really knew how to make fruit salad fun.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent portrayal of actual events.  It really makes you think and wonder how and why it happened the way it did.
B00447G29S|5.0|This movie is a Christmas masterpiece. It is based in a simple story that will captivate both kids and grown-ups for shure. And remember: Believe!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I think that the book was really good because if u need something that u don't know what? It's here.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Thriller like the older origianl Tom Clancy.  The ending was a little disappointing, but otherwise, mostly accurate, and although  a long book, it did not read long.  Almost makes me uneasy to use computers.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I love this book cuz I think It could give people information about the book, well once u use it duh...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Needed to get caught up and was glad I could get this episode from Amazon.  Great show!  Can't wait for a marathon reviewing session!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Sherikea since I first met you I always felt as if we had a special connection. I know I messed up today and I apologize for that but I never intended to hurt you. I just wanted her to do two things for me and she forced it. I know that I mess up all the time and there's an explanation for that. I mess up because I feel as if it makes us closer. I know that it doesn't sound right but that's why and I know sometimes you get tired of me, you get tired of all my bulls***, and me just getting on your nerves. I try to be on my best behavior but I get caught up in all this bulls*** with my ex and other females. I just hope that we can start over but continue to grow and show each other that we love each other very much. I mean I'm not trying to just look over this like I didn't go nothing wrong but I'm trying to put it in the past do that we can move forward. I'm not asking you to just forgive and act like nothing happened but to just put some trust in me and dig deep inside of you and try to give me another chance if you can. If you can't do that for me then I understand and I will let you go and do what ever it is that you want to do. I just hope that we can still talk to each other and to act civilized to each other for our kids sake. So please just look in your heart and come up with an answer that justify out love for each other with neither one of us having to feel sad or being depressed over it because I don't think I can handle it if you left me. I think I would feel really terrible about it and just not talk to any girls for a couple of months. So I'm just asking that you please make a decision that benefits both of us. I'm not trying to do you wrong again and I promise that you will never feel this way again. I really do love you with all my heart.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My granddaughter was just a bit underwhelmed even though this was one of the gifts she had wanted. I think it was overshadowed by the Taylor Swift cd and perfume.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has been working great on my Kindle Fire HD.  Highly recommended as a very useful and handy utility.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I think I turned down a chance to attend a Taylor Swift concert free. I got a telephone one night about 10:15 with a disc jockey type voice telling me my telephone number had drawn in a contest for the golden ticket. I didn't believe him because I knew I hadn't entered any contest. Later the next day, I remembered about the two Taylor Swift purchases I had made on Amazon for my granddaughter and realized the contest and my having won was probably for real. Oh well.
B006X08FDA|5.0|I love this combo of Blue grass and blues.. its light and lively.. you can hear the words and tap to the music
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My grandson wanted to assemble the Lego Captain America's Avenging Cycle immediately after opening the Christmas gift. It is true.
