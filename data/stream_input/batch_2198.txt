B001EBYMAI|5.0|I Loved this movie, having Keanu Reeves in it and it had that mystyrous biblical story in it as well, and a touch of romance but it never get's there but it's really not supposed to. Just a great movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Had read the first and wanted to finish the set of stories, second book was pretty interesting and seemed to follow the first book.
B000QE9ERK|5.0|First of all I love every movie that has Johnny Depp in it, I have very movie on DVD and now I am working on getting all on Digital Download. But this movie has got to be one of his best one's it's so dark and intriguing very little to no humor in this movie and what there is, it's not funny it's dark also. Which is a very  unlike most of his movie's. It's just a really great movie for anyone who likes Johnny Depp movie's must see this one!!
B001O03NCW|5.0|I love being able to digitally download some of my favorite CD's and this was on that I had purchased and played so much that I think I just wore it out.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Sometimes you find a book that tugs at your heartstrings so hard and you never want it to end. This is how I felt about The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick, the entire time I was reading it.<br /><br />The novel begins with Pat People's at a mental health institution in Baltimore, Maryland; the story is being told from his perspective.  As we learn a little about Pat's mental state, his mother comes to pick him up and takes him home to Collingswood, New Jersey. Pat is spending \\"apart time\\" from his wife, Nikki, because he is mentally unstable. Pat believes that if he loses weight and is kinder, \\"apart time\\" will end and he will be reunited with his wife. He also believes that he has only been away for a few months, but in reality, he has been gone for almost four years. Pat loves to workout, watch the Eagles play football, and read books that Nikki is reading with her class at the school she teaches at. Pat hates Kenny G, people touching him (except for Nikki,) and people who do not believe in silver linings.<br /><br />Pat meets Tiffany at a dinner party that is being thrown on his behalf by his best friend's wife. Tiffany is also struggling with her mental health after losing her husband. Pat and Tiffany form a relationship that vaguely resembles a friendship. They run together, go to the diner to eat raisin bran cereal, and confide in each other about their mental health.<br /><br />Pat believes he is living a movie, and that movie is his own life; he keeps searching and searching for his happy ending, his silver lining, throughout the entire novel. He doesn't want to watch any actual movies until he is done \\"starring in his own\\" because he believes that this is the only way to stay focused and end \\"apart time.\\" People fighting with mental health issues need love and understanding. The Silver Lining Playbook opened my own eyes and heart to these issues while seeing the world through Pat's eyes as he struggled with finding his silver lining.<br /><br />The Silver Linings Playbook has been turned into a feature film starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. I usually like to read the book before I see the movie, but in this instance, it was the other way around. Even though I liked the movie, I LOVED the book. The book is more touching and heartfelt than the movie is. I felt more of a connection to the characters and read the novel  non-stop from start to finish; only pausing to eat, sleep, and work.<br /><br />There is nothing I didn't like about this book. I can not remember the last time I read a book that I enjoyed from start to finish. Not only did Pat make my heart hurt on almost every page, but he also made me laugh on numerous occasions. I almost fell off the couch with laughter when Pat didn't believe that the Vet (the old Eagles/Phillies stadium) had been demolished and how he believed that he was having a hallucination while watching the video. Watching the Vet explode was traumatic, to say the least, and I can understand how someone who has been away from society for a few years could find it to be impossible.<br /><br />The Silver Linings Playbook reminded me of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, my most favorite book in the world; both books even reference Catcher in the Rye. I would recommend this book to anyone, male or female, who wants to be sucked into a story and come out feeling as though Pat Peoples is their friend, a friend who needs help in this scary world. I would especially recommend this book to anyone living in the New Jersey/Philadelphia area. Having pieces of home sprinkled throughout the book made it even more emotional for me: from Pat's and Geno's cheese steaks (I prefer Jim's on South Street) to the E-A-G-L-E-S chant being said on many of the pages. While reading this novel  I felt like I was back where I grew up, running the streets with Pat, as he tries to find his way to happiness.<br /><br />I received a free e-book copy of this book in return for an honest review.e Silver Linings Playbook has been turned into a feature film starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper.

B0013TTLDE|4.0|Well written.  Should be of interest to fans of Downton Abbey.  Clearly a &#34;ladies' book&#34; but of interest to anyone who enjoys reading about the past.  Mystery was well developed.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't let the book out of my site until it was gone.<br />In comparison to other sci-fi books, it feels like something related to our reality-TV obsessed culture.<br />The concept is not completely original, but very well written.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This was kind of raunchy, but that is the point I think. I think it would  confusing for parents, who are looking for something to watch with the kids becausel it is definitely not kid friendly. Don't know if this can be compared to anything, because it seems new to me. There were funny parts though.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Interesting,good cinematography, great acting and pace. It makes you think of how prohibition affected the whole nation and the violence , corruption and underground economy it promoted.  I like the fact that the movie questions  our stand on what is the law, who is the law and how something that is legal can become illegal the next or vice versa .
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|The only problem is the length of 2 1/2 hours. In spite of that, there is lots of action, but not overly sexed.
B00BJTGVTK|3.0|Most of the stories were for younger children. It didn't take long to read,I just whizzed through the stories so fast.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved this picture because of lots of action and very likable heroes. It is the best one of the whole series I think. I especially like the bad guy in this. Loki and Iron Man is always entertaining. There is a scene at the very end after the credits that was fun of the heroes in a diner.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is terrific! This is truly one of my new favorite games. I love how you can just go through and demolish all of these demons, and you can do it with one other person using the multiplayer mode. This is a must-have app for sure.

B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love adventure games and this is one of the better ones. I like the voice-over as that's somewhat unique for the genre. I also like that I can turn it off, though. I'm now addicted to the game and it's best I don't have to disturb others at night.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is written in such a way that puts you there when it is happening. Excellent Book! It is also a great history lesson and  everyone should take advantage of the opportunity to read about this trying time in our history.
0143039431|5.0|A harrowing book detailing the realities of life in America for migrant farm workers (\\"Okies\\" who went to CA during the dustbowl) before the implementation of the social programs of the New Deal. Although a fictional book, it accurately details the numerous difficulties that were faced by many Americans who were down on their luck for reasons beyond their control and  despite their hard work. This book should be mandatory reading for anyone who just doesn't understand why we need a social safety net.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this book because I'm a Legend of Zelda nerd and love all the games. I read one of the post about this game and i believe it  was the Holy Bible of the Legend of Zelda. So i had to buy it for my self<br /><br />The delivery was on time for one day-delivery.
B000FC12SM|1.0|The book is too long, If I wanted to have information from other texts I would do the research on my own.  This book is a waste of time and money.  Most people do not need to be told the same thing for three chapters to comprehend what is being said.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Big story told in a simple linear fashion.  There was some confusion at points as the writer flipped from giving credit to others  to being surrounded by people who couldn't get the job done.<br /><br />The real voice that came through was genuine.  A caring committed person, warts and all, goes all in.  Time changes his focus, and the resulting story is well told.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie is as lovely as the book.  It was beautifully filmed and imagined.  I enjoyed the whole movie from beginning to end.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|This a cute movie. My grandchildren loved it. I love ordering online and recieving it in the mail. No hassels, very easy ordering.
0765325950|5.0|I just finished MOL today and I am very happy and content with the finale.  I am sorry that many reviewers were dissappointed with the ending and all I can figure was that they set expectations so high, any ending is a let down.  Jordan's first seven books were excellent, but the rest of the books he wrote were hit and miss at best developing too many minor characters.  It really felt as if he didn't want to turn off the money spigot that is the WoT series and he was going to make the series his meal ticket for life.  Unfortunately, he died too young and Sanderson was recruited to clean up the mess Jordan had created after such a promising start.  I know that many have complained that many characters were not sufficiently wrapped up, but quite frankly there was so many characters that many of the names were similar in spelling and led to confusion to those of us who refused to reread the series every couple of years when a new book came out.  Sanderson gives the series a satisfying end that addresses all the major characters and some of the minor ones as well.  WoT deserves an ending, and Sanderson delivers.  The action in MOL is nonstop and goes right to the last pages with very little self-indulgment at the end.  What happens after the Last Battle?  I'm sure that would take another 10,000+ pages to fully explain...

0385341008|3.0|Note: My original review for this book was previously posted on my blog, The Baking Bookworm ([...])<br /><br />My Thoughts: For the past year, at least, I've heard nothing but praise for this book. I had been on the waiting list at our library for what seemed like decades so I was quite happy to finally have reached the summit of that long, long waiting list.<br /><br />\\"Guernsey\\" was a good read but was a little too .... calm? Not sure if that's the right word. There wasn't a whole lot of momentum or depth to the storyline ... especially considering the fact that it dealt with such a serious subject matter. Perhaps it was because the book was written in letter form (letters back and forth between the characters) which limits what the authors can do.<br /><br />I have a big interest in WWII for some reason and I did find it really interesting reading about the the Nazi Occupation and how it affected the people of Guernsey as well as the aftermath of WWII. But, personally, I liked how Ursula Hegi dealt with WWII in her wonderful book \\"The Stones From the River\\" (one of my all-time favourite books).<br /><br />The best part of the book for me was Elizabeth's story. While I don't want to give it away I found that storyline intrigued me the most. I think \\"Guernsey\\" was meant to be an easy-going read and I think it delivered. I expected it to be more raw and more of a \\"can't put down\\" type of book, which is wasn't for me. Please don't get me wrong. Overall, \\"Guernsey\\" is a good read ... just not what I was expecting. I hate that about really hyped books ... all of the hype often makes the book feel less than it is.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book. It is an interesting era of time and the characters are easy to embrace and bring quite a quirky sense of humour. I especially like some of Juliet's dry quips back and forth to Sidney.<br /><br />My Rating: 3.5 stars
B000F8O35U|5.0|the little mermaid is a great Disney movie, every kid will love this, as well as the adults, buy it.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|As with previous Bond's, this movie has plenty of action, the end even provides us a glimpse into Bond's future and Bond movie's past.  The only disappointment was when Q said &#34;We don't do exploding pens anymore&#34; WHAT! We love the exploding pen stuff.  When my 10 year old son inquired my husband said you should really see the other James Bond movies, there are more than one.  He looked at us and asked if they were in Black and White....hmmm, do I feel old now.
B000MX7V5M|4.0|If I could, I'd probably give To Catch a Thief 3.5 stars. To be sure, it has a lot of wonderful touches, beginning with the two leads, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Though Grant is not the Grant of, say, ten years earlier, there's still enough charisma there to not want to take your eyes off the screen. At least one other reviewer has described Kelly as too wooden of an actress, and I can understand how one would come to that point of view, but beneath the somewhat cool exterior there's a strong suggestion of powerful undercurrents. The plot is engaging, to say the least: A jewel thief who joined the French Resistance during World War II has long since turned his back on his old way of life, but a rash of burglaries makes everyone, including his old comrades, suspect he's back in business. To clear himself, he teams up with an insurance representative to capture the real thief, finding romance along the way. Sadly, the story still comes across to me as somewhat limp. Segments linger on, seemingly to simply showcase the stars in elegant clothes or to give us a taste of leisurely pursuits along the Riviera. To be honest, there aren't that many true dramatic turns in the story until the very end, and even much of the climax is handled in a somewhat dull manner.  Still, the cast manage to keep this one afloat, so I'm going to be generous: 4 stars.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in recent times. The acting is Academy Award caliber. Kevin Spacey's performance is outstanding. He delivers the best performance I have ever seen in a series made for TV (or Nextflix, in this particular case). Others have gone into some detail on what the show is about so I won't repeat the same in my short review here. I highly recommend this show and I am sure you will be blown away by it. Make sure you have some free time as the watching experience gets addictive. You will probably want to finish seeing the whole season in one shot. It starts out a bit slow but it gets better very fast. I think Netflix really hit the nail right on the head with this great show. I highly recommend it.
B007REV4T8|4.0|The fact is, in the truly big scheme of things, I greatly prefer the original James Bond, by which I mean the character realized in the writings of Ian Fleming. The cinematic Bond has pretty much always been a different kettle of fish and chips -- not necessarily better or worse but just different -- and a kettle I've warmed to or not depending on the actor portraying him and the story line he finds himself in. Though not Bond as Fleming envisioned him exactly, Daniel Craig is the actor Bond I have found most satisfying overall, and he doesn't disappoint in his third outing as the British spy with a license to kill. Gritty and rough-edged, he can glide through an elegant party, fitting the occasion to a tee though his eyes tell you he'd rather be elsewhere. So chalk up a positive point for this film. Of number two importance, even in the books, is the Bond villain. Here I think the film doesn't quite satisfy. Oh, Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva apparently gathered much praise from critics for his performance, and I suppose on further reflection I'd have to agree with him -- his performance is excellent. However, I found the Silva character as drawn by the screenplay to be actually rather ordinary and at times even a bit sloppy and inefficient. So, for me, villainy in this Bond film actually turns out to be somewhat run-of-the-mill, despite the lethal blows that Silva manages to strike against British Intelligence.  Next up are the supporting characters, and here Skyfall provides a wealth of engaging new blood for the franchise. Naomie Harris is excellent in a role that turns out to be more than it seems. Ben Whishaw is a marvel as the new, more youthful Q. And the venerable Ralph Fiennes is just right as Gareth Mallory, whose name holds a clue concerning that character's future role in the series. So now the score is 2-1. On to the stunts and the gadgets and other miscellaneous fireworks. They're adequate, though no great shakes, in my opinion. The opening struggle ontop of a speeding train is spectacular if, in its manner, a bit cliched. There's a fair amount of destruction but, again, nothing all that novel; let's call it all a draw to make it 2-1-1. As for the Bond girl, well, there's one in Severine as played by Berenice Marlohe, though her performance is limited in more ways than one. Another draw for me, and we're at 2-1-2. That leaves the general contribution of this film to Bond mythology, and here I give the film a firm win: We get a meaningful and illuminating glimpse of Bond's childhood past, and we see him cry over a deep personal loss. And there we have it: A final tabulation of 3-1-2. In less analytical terms, Skyfall does most things a Bond film should either adequately or in stellar fashion, except provide a truly memorable villain. So it's not perfect, but I still find it much better than okay.
0316069434|5.0|After a few sub-par stories (9 Dragons in my opinion) Harry Bosch is back doing what he does best. Seeking justice. Hats off to Mr. Connelly. A lesser writer would keep Harry locked in around age 45. But not Connelly. Harry is in his early sixties and we feel every ache, every strain. Every pop in his knees.<br /><br />At home, Harry has to contend with a daughter who shows all the signs of following in dad's footsteps. At work, Harry has to deal with a looming retirement and a brass that wants him gone.<br /><br />Harry is probably the most real character in popular fiction today. I hope he makes it to retirement, Mads becomes a cop and both appear in other novels as supporting characters.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]

B006ZS4FE8|5.0|We purchased this at our local LEGO store at the mall for about 99 dollars. Usually, Amazon is cheaper than brick and mortar stores, but in this case we were surprised to see this listed here for about 150 dollars.  Anywho, our 7 year old daughter was thrilled to get this, and she enthusiastically put it together in a few hours.  She loves 'role playing' with this for hours, and when we hear her talking by herself in the next room, we know she's having a blast with her LEGO 'summer riding camp'!
B000I9YWDO|4.0|a lot of what went on in this movie plot goes on today; i hope they re do it with an updated story.

B003HE2B9E|5.0|Once again Orianthi shows her talent and skills on this half album. Now the reason I call it that is because you get some new songs yes, but you also get some from Believe (I). But before you say that is a waste, these are alternative versions of the songs off Believe one. So while they are the same &#34;songs&#34; they sound very different. If you haven't, look into Orianthi Panagaris and you will find shes not just some &#34;pop star&#34;........because she isn't one. Yes this album has pop rock on it, but you can tell once you hear her guitar that she is a die hard rocker and blues girl. That is why she has worked with ZZ Top, Prince, Micheal Jackson (ill-fated &#34;This Is It&#34; tour and concert film) and her two very good friends Steve Vai and Santana and she is currently about to release her new album called &#34;Heaven in this Hell&#34;. Now if your looking for the bluesier side of Ori look into this album, comes out very this month. If all that wasn't enough to sell you on this girl look her up on youtube, and shes currently a lead guitarist in Alice Cooper's band........need I say more. Deff worth the money and if you ever have the chance to see her, do it.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|The first season was outstanding so I was looking forward to these episodes. However something has gone seriously wrong. I haven't read the books, so I can't say whether it is the source material or the adaptation, but this season bogs down into endless tête-à-tête discussions about past lovers, current lovers, future lovers, their disappointment in children, how they have been treated by siblings, and what they feel about their fathers. Sort of a \\"Days of Our Medieval Lives\\" soap opera.<br /><br />In addition, the plot jerks forward through an endless series of improbable coincidences and fantastically unlikely events. This is deus ex machina operated in assembly line fashion. It actually gets dreadfully predictable. At one point the Night Watch patrol is digging in the snow, and there is a metallic clang. I turned to my wife and said \\"time for them to find a relic of the First Men\\". The characters cleaned snow from a large inscribed disk, and the first line spoken was, \\"That's the mark of the First Men!\\".<br /><br />Characters are able to lead small bands through hundreds of miles of enemy territory just so they can meet to talk about their fathers. In the last episode, characters hiding in a besieged castle come out after the siege is ended and instead of finding the victorious army in the city or camped around it, no one is in sight. Everyone has gone home (probably because of sequestration) and so they tramp off to the north.<br /><br />With so much of the time spent on meetings and discussions, I thought perhaps they had engaged David Weber (Mr. Roberts Rules of Order) as a script writer. But no, it is a junior Ms. Roberts Rules of Order who bears this responsibility.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|Many people who have not experienced the special relationship between a parent and child - particularly a special needs child - will have a hard time understanding this story until they research Asperger's Sydrome.  Heck, it may even just click.<br /><br />This child is on a quest for meaning, purpose, perfection, and the answer to life, all apparently left for him by his deceased father.  The irony is, his father taught him all those things already, yet the boy embarks on an adventure to find it all inside himself afterall.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock was an amazing mother figure in this movie, and I thoroughly weeped &#34;at that moment&#34;, and every time I watch it again.
0780619587|5.0|Not only is this is an academy award winner about a great pianist, but the star, Geoffery Rush is the actual pianist and very well known classics.  But, more than that, it focuses on acceptance of people with neurobiological brain illnesses and their capabilities.
030771652X|5.0|Although I had a little trouble getting into this story -- with the way it was written, letter style, once I felt comfortable with that, I could not put the book down.<br /><br />My sister recommended the book to me and she is as much an avid reader as I am.<br /><br />I have already passed it on to two others who share my enthusiasm.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a fun game to play in free time. I enjoy the changing themes as thunderous game fresh over time as it can be one boring after a while.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I Love hidden object games and this is a quick little time waster. The short quests are interesting and I like the manor design.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending was not good and did not like up to the expectation. Although the book was good for most of the part, the ending could have been much better.
B00BHU2A7I|2.0|\\"Hitchcock\\" is about 100 minutes long and about 70 minutes of the running time is concerned with two subplots: Hitchcock's relationship with his wife, Alma Reville, and Hitchcock's hallucinations of Ed Gein, the serial killer who was the original inspiration for the book, and then the movie.  Of those 70 minutes, practically a full hour involves Hitchcock's relationship with his wife.  This is totally unnecessary.<br /><br />I was hoping for a kind of \\"inside baseball\\" on the creation and the production of the film.  There was about a half hour of that. A far better film that grapples with the issues of creation and production is \\"Topsy Turvy\\" concerning Gilbert and Sullivan's \\"Mikado\\"  (and even that film had irrelevant subplots.)<br /><br />It's hard not to feel that this film was meant as an hommage to Hitchcock and then got derailed into a relationship film between a man and a woman; woman feels unappreciated, but at the end, her guy tells her he loves her.  There's a place for that kind of film. But it's disappointing here.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I really hate it when you just have to kill a character, who is significant for the protagonist. The book is definitely not as good as the first one. Reading through it was like a chore.

B001NLKT60|3.0|The book continues right where The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo left off. While it kept me reading (and continuing on to the rest of the trilogy) and entertained, I wouldn't say it's necessary to read on past the first book.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Completely enjoyable and very intense.  Acting was excellent, story very engaging.  Can watch over and over and never see the same movie twice!
B008N1V11U|2.0|I bought this game for my 5 year old son at Christmas. I never pay actual money for games, usually only free ones. This game was on sale and my son had begged for a new game on the kindle fire for Christmas, I gave in and downloaded FOREVER! My sons and husband enjoyed the game with awesome graphics, for about 2 weeks. Then it just quit. We tried it several times, finally I just had to remove it. The game was taking up too much space on the kindle.

1433503794|5.0|Crossway's ESV Study Bible came out in 2008 and has been one of the most popular study Bibles on the market. With its vast amount of quality features, it's not hard to understand why. With 20,000 notes and 50 articles, the scope of this Bible is so large that it seems to contain a full library of Bible study materials. It's no wonder the list of contributor's takes six pages. This Bible also included an extra surprise that I didn't expect.<br /><br />Cover and Binding<br />This edition is TruTone Brown Cordovan with Portfolio Design. It's one of the nicest imitation leathers that I've seen. I love browns and tans for Bible covers and I especially love the look and feel of this one. It doesn't feel cheap at all. It has an elegant look and a nice grain. The outer perimeter is stitched. The liner is a thick vinyl/paper that is also brown to match the cover.<br /><br />The binding is Smyth sewn. It has no problem lying flat.<br /><br />Paper and Print<br />The paper is 30 GSM. That sounds like it should be very thick paper, but it feels thinner than that to me with about average paper and opacity. There is some show-through, but it's not bad at all.<br /><br />The main font is Lexicon 9/10. The print is just the right amount of darkness and is very consistent. Headings are maybe an 8-point and are italic. The notes are much smaller. I'm just guessing, but maybe a 6-point.<br /><br />Layout<br />The text is in single-column paragraph format. References are located on the inner margin and are keyed to the text with letters. They also include the verse numbers in bold, making them easy to find quickly.  Translation notes are placed under the text and are keyed to the text with numbers. Commentary notes are in double-column format and appear under the translation notes. They show the verse number in bold. The notes also include the portion of text they key to in bold. Some notes have titles that are highlighted and in italics. These notes apply to large passages, spanning many verses.<br /><br />At the top of the left page is the book name, chapter, and verse that starts on that page and on the right page is the book name, chapter, and verse of the last verse on the page. The color for highlights is an earth-tone tan/green. This color appears throughout the Bible in tables, charts, chapter numbers, etc. I like the earth-tone look and feel.<br /><br />Book Introductions<br />The book introductions are very detailed and average around 5-6 pages (depending on the size of the book). Information covers author and title, date and location, theme, purpose, occasion, and background, key themes, history of salvation summary, timeline, and a detailed outline. Some books have maps showing the setting of the book and a section that covers a key event in that book.<br /><br />Notes<br />There is a vast amount of notes in this Bible. The box says 2 million words with 20,000 notes. I didn't count. I'm just taking their word for it. Like any study Bible with commentary the notes are going to be theologically biased, and like every study Bible I review, I caution readers to do their own study and not just rely on the notes in the Bible. All notes are written by fallible man and should always be cross-examined. I use notes only as a guide or for a second opinion. With that said, most of the notes in the ESV Study Bible offer more than one point of view. As an example, the note for Genesis 1:26 for `us' discusses the view of God speaking with angels and the view of God speaking to Himself. This note does draw a conclusion, but at least another view is discussed. Many notes give references to similar passages or passages that explain and substantiate the note. There are also lots of Hebrew and Greek definitions and explanations. The notes are very extensive and probably average about half the page.<br /><br />Articles<br />This Bible is filled with articles (50). Most span many pages, and some, like the one on Biblical Ethics, cover many subtopics. Someof the articles are doctrinal based and are heavily biased theologically. There are also many articles about studying the Bible, manuscripts, the original languages, reading the Bible, interpretation, the cannon of Scripture, Biblical archaeology, and much more. These are by far my favorite articles because I'm very interested in the canon and Hebrew and Greek. I'm grateful that Crossway included them.<br /><br />Concordance<br />The concordance is 77 pages with three columns per page. There is actually more entries than I expected. There are 56 entries for `God'.<br /><br />Bible Reading Plan<br />I've come to expect a Bible to have a Bible reading plan. They've put a lot of thought into this reading plan. It has a one-year plan that gives you four readings every day. First is Psalms and Wisdom Literature, then Pentateuch and History of Israel, then Chronicles and Prophets, and finally Gospels and Epistles. This gives you four sections every day. Each of the sections is carefully planned out. The readings from Psalms and Wisdom Literature are designed to be appropriate for the beginning and end of the year. The Pentateuch and History of Israel takes you through the five books of Moses, then chronologically through the Old Testament. The Chronicles and Prophets are also set up chronologically. The Gospels and Epistles are grouped by author. This is a great reading plan for people like me who like to skip around. This allows you to skip around and still read systematically.<br /><br />Maps<br />Aside from the more than 200 color maps in the text, there are 15 maps in the back. They're full color and printed on very thick paper. They're labeled well, making it easy to find what I'm looking for. I would like to have an index to maps, but if there isn't an index I want the maps labeled like these are.<br /><br />Ribbon<br />I love the ribbon in this Bible. It is copper color and is much thicker than most ribbons. It greatly adds to the elegant feel of this Bible. If I were to make any changes I would have at least two ribbons.<br /><br />Free ESV Online Study Bible<br />Just when I thought it couldn't get much better I read the card that came with the Bible and found that it gives me an access code that gives me free access to the ESV Online Study Bible. The online edition contains everything that is found in the print version plus new features. You can create your own notes, do searches, follow links, and listen to the ESV Bible in audio.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />The ESV Study Bible is an amazing Bible. The amount of study material makes this a large study library. Of course to get all this material in one volume requires the Bible to be extra-large and heavy, but the quality of the notes and articles makes it worth it. It is a great study tool for teachers and preachers as well as students of God's Word. I highly recommend the ESV Study Bible.<br /><br />For pictures see this review on Bible Buying Guide<br /><br />Crossway provided this Bible free for review. I was not required to give a positive review- only an honest review.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I really enjoyed most of this CD.  The duets with J Lo and the deceased Edith Pilaf are especially good.  There is one song that seems to have background noise.  I don't know if it is supposed to be there or not, but I find it irritating.  Otherwise quite a good CD.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is so addicting!  Time consuming when you are bord! Works great on Kindle.They have a chat to meet and find team mates too.
0316232955|5.0|My high school was never this interesting.<br /><br />I’ve never watched Glee and I didn’t know anything about Chris Colfer before I read this book. Maybe I’ve lived under a rock, but that’s okay. When I passed this book at the store, I stopped to check it out. The title grabbed me right away. Struck by Lightning. Okay, I’ll give it a try. I’m glad I did.<br /><br />Carson Phillips is the standard outcast kid with huge dreams. He’s not had the best start in life and will find out just how messed up life can get. But I rooted for him all the way. His voice in the story is forthright and funny. I laughed and cried along with him. He’s got a great cast of characters set in an average high school.<br /><br />I loved Carson’s pluck. This kid never quit and when it looked like he should, he gave another 110%. He’s mischievous but driven. It’s great. I also loved his relationship with his grandmother. She’s suffering from dementia but she’s the one person who hasn’t given up on Carson. It’s bittersweet and sweet. I love how she always has his back.<br /><br />The secondary characters helped make the story memorable, too. I loved Malerie. She’s innocent, but there’s much more to her than meets the eye.<br /><br />Granted, there is some swearing in this book. It’s definitely geared for the upper high school set, but anyone from around 16 years old and up will be able to identify with at least one character.<br /><br />If you want a book that will make you laugh, cry and want more, then this is a great place to start.<br /><br />Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I cross my heart if I lie I wish to die  this took me concrete to read omg very stupid and plus I loved how it end so good
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A very fast read, couldn't put it down.<br />I still can get over Tom Cruise as Reacher, he's good but he's not Reacher.<br />I'm just saying...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series!  Very captivating, it interrupted my life for several weeks.  I'm very intrigued now that I've completed season 3.
1118156315|4.0|If you like telegraphic pictorial information then this book is a treasure trove of information that will help you reinvent yourself.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|An interesting treatment of time travel. It's a bit far-fetched that the only application of the possibility of time travel is as a futuristic replacement for the East River.
B0088749CW|4.0|Possibly Jessica Biel's best performance. I think of her as an average actress but here she does above average work. Now this movie is 4 stars because it above average horror movie. It is not a bloody slasher flick, torture porn, or other gory type. It is a modern story that is built on a basic concept executed with competence. It can create some thought after the movie is over, but nothing that will have you talking too far into the future. The fact that a discussion can be had about this movies plot after it is over (and I mean this in a positive manner) earns it points.<br /><br />If you are looking for interesting  horror movie that at least some thouhgt went into this movie can be a little surprise.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|It's always difficult to determine how much analysis movies like this deserve. The question that arises toward the end of the second hour is &#34;do I really care about Freddie Quell, and, if so, why?&#34; Phillip Seymour Hoffman is compelling and carries the movie - Phoenix is a net drag on it. Amy Adams is also very good, as is Laura Dern. Phoenix's name on a film has become, for me, a warning label.
B005LAII8K|5.0|This movie is a home run. Performances are good, direction is great, and ideas are interesting. A science fiction story that is rich in ideas. The movie only spends time explaining the concepts that must be understood to follow the plot, it leaves the rest to the viewer to figure out. Or not as the details of the world are not crucial to the story the director is telling. That lack of hand holding can create lots of discussion and thought, which I think is great. The negative is that some people will think there are wholes in the directors world simply because not everything is said straight out.<br /><br />Enjoyable science fiction movie with a fun thoughtful plot and performances to match.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This short story reminded me of some of King's early works. Great character development and his special ability to think like a kid really would and then put it down on paper. A really good read and a treat that I missed somewhere along the way.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Such a great movie. My all time favorite!  Kate & Luke are a perfect match for each other. True heart felt love prevails.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Terrible movie with good actors, too artsy and disconnected with poor character development, a torture to get to the end.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I really do like the storyline and how it is all executed. I am so glad its free on prime!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|You have to trace a path to connect each end of a pipe to the other. You cannot cross over another pipe. It took me a little time the first couple of times I played to figure out how to do it. After playing 4 or 5 times it becomes kind of easy to figure out to do it each time.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|It's hard to get the Kindle Fire into and out of this cover. The little groove on the back that allows the front cover to flip over and become prop to hold the device is so shallow that the device falls flat every few minutes. And don't even think about playing a game while it's propped up. As soon as you tap the screen the cover collapses and it's laying flat again. Threw it in the trash.
B0086700CM|1.0|This is a chase game. you are constantly chased at high speed. You use your finger to guide your player through a trail to keep from being caught. When you get caught you just start over. Not to much fun.
0385344228|4.0|On the surface, Andy Barber and his family seemed like the typical small town suburban family.  However, readers quickly learn that nothing in this Massachusetts town is typical when fourteen year-old Ben Rifkin is murdered.  Andy, Assistant District Attorney, takes Ben's case, which quickly becomes a conflict of interest when his son Jacob is charged with Ben's murder.  This was enough to spark my interest in Defending Jacob.<br /><br />Once Jacob is charged, much of the aftermath consists of Andy and his wife, Laurie, coping with the thought that their son may be a murderer.  Even though Andy is removed from the case, he continues investigating to find the \\"real murderer\\".  For me, this investigation yielded some predictable and some surprising facts.  For the majority of the book, I felt like the author would not spin towards an expected outcome, so I found myself continuously predicting and asking questions about the case.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of Andy; yet, readers are able to capture of glimpse of Jacob's personality. Overall, Jacob seemed like a normal fourteen year-old boy, which convinced me that he could not possibly commit a murder.  Yet, the more I learned about Jacob and his past; I often had to reevaluate my opinion.  There were a few points in the book where I was slightly unenthusiastic, but the need to confirm my suspicions motivated me to finish reading.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book it seemed like William Landay was leaning towards an unsurprising conclusion.  Within a few pages, this all changed.  If you want to read a book with shocking and suspenseful ending, this is the book!
030746363X|1.0|This is the biggest farse yet!  The first week you lose a few pounds, but after the splurge day you spend the whole next week losing what you gained.  I tried for over a month and no more weight lose.  Plus developed severe stomach pain in it.
B00BKVKAC6|5.0|I heard everyone talking about this show and decided to give it a shot. After the first episode I ended up watching 3 more. Then had to work 3 hours later. This is one of the best television shows I've seen and want to see more after every episode. Couldn't ask for more.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game. it is very addictive.  you don't have to buy coins. you get more coins every 3 hours. I play it everyday
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's a nice read for something for a long drive. Had to reread some parts but it turned out to be pretty good
B007HPO3CC|5.0|Beautifully done production. - If you're a &#34;Thrones&#34; fan -- it should be in your library. -- If  you are not, you will be after viewing this series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love that I got it before they all aired in the US. I was able to watch them on DVD first then again on TV.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Took me about 3 weeks to finish this book (I'm a slow reader). I really enjoyed it. There are some grammar errors and the book is very much science and math oriented, but it was defiantly a page turner. I would recommend this book for readers that enjoy survival against the elements books.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A typical Nicholas Sparks story, set in South Carolina, of course. It  is still a page turner, and holds a surprise or two within the predictable plot.  The world is always in need of a happy ending.x
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am playing catch-up with Downton Abbey's second season and love every minute. Creator Julian Fellowes keeps the plot moving at a breathless pace so there is never a dull moment.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|this game needs to be updated and fixed. it is impossible to see where you are going and the controls are horrible. I do like the ball explosion, however. almost (almost)  worth downloading for that. do not get unless it is free.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app will do the job but with less features than the computer one. This app does the job fairly well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have only played it a couple levels, but so far the game is pretty fun. Have not had any glitches.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have read 2 of the 4 book of the saga. The first ones were excelent.<br />I expect to have the same quality of suspense and entertainment in all 4 volumes.

B0081336FO|5.0|New characters were introduced for second season bringing new life into the plots.  The antagonism between Sherlock and Holmes , which is really a result of Sherlocks selfish devotion to the case and lack of care for any compassion for anyone else, adds a new element from the old movies.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I dont usually like scary shows but I love this one.  Great Sci-Fi with hot guys! This season is one of the best since season 2.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is very smooth and the graphics are great. The Facebook integration is over the top and actually detracts from the experience.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|My friend told me it was amazing, then I found out it was directed by Ben Affleck and started wondering. But after watching it I was thoroughly impressed and now I think much higher of Affleck.<br /><br />The movie was so suspenseful and had me enjoying every minute. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0765325950|5.0|I have read all the Wheel of Time books and this was a great ending to a great series.  I recommend this series to any Fantisy lover
B004UPANAI|1.0|We had to turn this movie off after the 1st 10 minutes.<br />We didn't want our children watching all the violence.<br />Didn't expect this due to its PG-13 rating and expectations from past X-men movies.
B002E66C6E|5.0|One of the better submarine-based action movies. Interesting story, well paced with plenty of action, drama. Acting ok overall. Date movie? Maybe. Spousal unit? Maybe. Guy movie? Yes. Not a lot of foul language for extreme violence.
6304189575|4.0|RARE Easter Holiday Special from the 90s.....I remember seeing this on tv as a kid!<br /><br />\\"It's Easter and time for a picnic in Chucklewood Forest. Ranger Jones is teaching Buttons & Rusty all about the celebration, and how everything comes alive for the season. When the cubs learn about Easter eggs, they sneak their way into the secret underground egg factory, as they pose to be bunnies. Their mischievous disguise gets them into lots of trouble, but the adventure teaches them all about the spirit of Easter.\\"<br />1996; approx 25 mins.<br /><br />Chucklewood Critters was an American line of television specials and an animated TV series created by former Hanna-Barbera animators, Bill Hutten and Tony Love, which centered on two woodland animals: Buttons, a young bear cub, and Rusty, a fox cub. It started as a Christmas special in 1983 called \\"The Christmas Tree Train\\", followed by eight more holiday/seasonal specials like \\"A Chucklewood Easter\\". In 1997 it was developed into a series entitled \\"The New Chucklewood Critters\\", which ran for two seasons.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Nice little film that is funny, serious, dramatic, has highs and lows and Hathaway is great. Date movie? Yes. Wife or significant other movie? Yes. A guy movie?? Not so much as no explosions, car crashes or gun fire. I loved it.
B00979CS50|5.0|I have enjoyed Neils output of music ever since a friend picked up Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere back when it was released when I was a freshman in high school. I really was floored by that record and it has a lot to do with why I really like Psychedelic Pill. I was learning how to Play guitar in the early 70's and was amazed at what guitar players from that era were doing and thrilled it was so available. I guess it's knowing what is involved in somethings workings by ones own experiences and efforts to do something that make one admire the efforts of others.....Guitar playing did not come real easy for me at all but I can see the workings of the process and to this day I am still impressed with something I hear and know what it took to actually play something. Anyway, those longer jam songs like Down By The River and Cowgirl In The Sand were what made me admire Neil and his abilities and still draw me to him and other players to this day. So...to me a Jam like Driftin' Back is what I myself just really enjoy listening to. When I heard about this release and saw the title and song length of Driftin' Back I just knew it would be something I would love to listen to and it damn sure is! Also the lyrics of Mr Young have always been along the same lines of my own understanding of life so needless to say my collection of Neil Young recordings is substantial and I never go too awful long without putting on one of his works of art to enjoy...yet again! I really think Psychedelic Pill is classic Neil and feel really lucky to be able to listen to it.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|George C. Scott as Patton is perfect in every way. This movie is about Patton but it is also about WWII and tells all well. If you a history buff, you must see this film. Great in every way. Recommend to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the New subway surfer!it's much fun!<br />Everyone will adore this game because it is the coolest game in the entire world and galaxy.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Great gangster, Mafia, story with great cast, directed by great director Scorsese. Liked it from start to finish and Nicholson is superb. Well paced, suspense, action, what more could you ask for?? Date movie? Maybe. Wife or significant other? Maybe. Guy movie? Yes.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This product was fantastic, from the score composed by Vangelis, which made you truly appreciate the movie both physically and emotionally, to the uncut and uncensored version of Deckard's legendary monologue, it was simply a marvel to behold...To think that this was made by the same man who produced and directed the amazing film Alien is unbelievable! And its cult status still preceeds it even after all these years, and that is the makings of a true classic. The cast is an arrangement of some of the best actors to date, their interaction with eachother in the film is simply poetry. Not to mention there were hours upon hours of footage and extras including photos, product sketches and much more. Believe me its worth the cash, and your love for this film will grow to new heights with each watch, especially because of the bonus versions of the film included! It is the best collectors pack for the most ultimate fan! You will not be disappointed.
B006G7R25W|3.0|Was a big budget action movie when released with all star cast. It is ok but acting is pondering, heavy, at times. Decent enough pacing. Story? Includes submarine and lots of shots of inside nuclear sub but not about sub. Rock Hudson as captain and he plays it ok. Overall, worth a look for this \\"big budget\\" Date movie? No women in picture, so no. Spousal unit? Maybe as no foul language and not overly violent.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Loved the whole series and am waiting for the movie. These books kept my attention and once I started reading, I couldn't stop.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|History buffs must see this great film. British. Now a classic. Story is great but not one of William Holden's better acting jobs. Must see.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought it was a very good book it shows even if your not looking for love it may happen even if you least expect it.
031606792X|5.0|I loved these books!  They were a fast read, very entertaining, and had interesting plots.  Did I think Bella was a bit of a rag, and wonder what Edward saw in her?  Of course, but at least in the last book she becomes her &#34;true self&#34; and finally steps up to the plate.  This was a great series, very enjoyable.
0307719774|4.0|this book is great.  some questions are contemplative, some sad, happy, excited, hopeful, etc.  BUT-- it's kind of cumbersome, because it's very small considering how many pages they are.  If there's ever an edition in &#34;large&#34; i suggest getting that instead.
0345803507|1.0|This was by far the most ridiculous book in the series, if that's even possible.  A ludicrous plot,  the dumbest &#34;heroine&#34; ever, and a<br />baby thrown in for good measure.  I'm  kicking myself for wasting time reading this, but I figured how much worse could the last book be?  I loaned out all my copies to friends, who have not even read them yet now that the hype is gone.  My advice, don't bother.
0394818237|5.0|My Grandchild Penny loves the book.. even wants to take it to Preschool to share.. It's fun because the book is retro with it's people's occupations.
0345803485|2.0|Embarrassed I bought this, but everyone was talking about it last year.  I was totally gobsmacked when I read it, talk about porn in print! Stupid love story, she's a moron and he's a controlling sadist, nice, huh??
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great game to pass the time. Fun for adults and children. I like the missions because it gives you an objective.
0345803493|2.0|Ok, so I did buy the whole set at once, and I did read them all.  I cannot believe how gross some of this was, SO unrealistic of true love.  Had to cringe at the &#34;red room of pain&#34; and was disgusted that the heroine took to this immediately.  Everyone I know is reading it and we do laugh about it.  Guess this is one author who is laughing all the way to the bank!!
B00AEFYZ2K|5.0|Definitely brings a sense of nostalgia for me. I've loved this movie since I was a kid. I'm super happy to have it added back to my collection.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Being former military, a generation earlier, a realistic view into what goes on in the life of a sniper.  A good read
B004SIIBGU|5.0|actually feels a little more natural than the iphone version.  wish there was an easier way to use the camera on my kindle fire for selling.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|My favorite part was that the hidden object scenes came with an optional match type game if you chose. There is a hint button but i didnt really need it and the graphics and storyline were good. Impressed for the first time with g5 games. Keep it up!
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I thought this book was good. A little  to short for my taste but still a good read. Looking forward to the next one.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Perfect and so relaxing to hear the late great George Harrison. There was a few I hadn't heard so that was a pleasant surprise.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good read! Keeps your interest and  keeps you on the edge of your seat at times. I recommend this book
B00005214X|5.0|More great George Harrisongs. This is so convenient in the boxed edition. A must have for any serious George fan.
0783225733|5.0|Great movie even for a science class.  The language is a little rough for the younger generations, but the movie is very accurate and educational.
B000PVAFT0|5.0|I wish i would have known that DEEP SEA and UNDER THE SEA are the exact dvd's<br />only different narrators
B009X010RU|5.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas when she received her Kindle Fire as a present. It's great protection and looks great. The texture of it fits well in your hand as well. She loves it and I'd buy another one in a different color if I ever bought a Kindle for myself.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i love this product, i highly recommend it  i organize everything from work to youth sports on it and with the multiple platforms, the info is always available
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Came on time and played flawlessly.  Awesome movie and well worth the slight difference in price for the Blu ray
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has updates like ur in rome and have special peaple and boards you can buy and in new york you have a different character and board to unlock i love it its like temple run
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The case is nice but it would be awesome if it were available in other colors and beside this shade of red. Tuesday I had an issue with my Kindle Fire HD. The top half of the screen was black and blank. The next day it was fine. I would like to exchange it for a replacement Kindle Fire if possible! You have my information on file. Thank you!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love Downton Abbey - can't wait for season 4.  Latest announcements were somewhat of a surprise but will be interesting to see what happens next.
B00797MB0O|2.0|Boring...plot was not interesting!. Thought it was going to be better but I almost fell asleep. Please don't waste your time.
0062082353|5.0|A great story of a brave man that served his country. Could have achieved much more by his intentions to help others. Such a untimely death.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|I didn't like this game at first because I couldn't control the marble to any reasonable degree.  But then came an update and I can control the marble quite well now (at least I can do it well enough that I like playing this game now!).  I alternate between not liking the program sounds and thinking they are very nice.  I'm liking them more as time goes on, though I do keep them on a low volume.  I think the scene that happens when you fall off the track takes up less time than it did previously, and that's good.  At least I'm not at all concerned with that anymore.<br /><br />I really appreciate that the programmer has addressed a lot of the comments.  Thanks!
0740748475|1.0|Why in the world would a company want to print something half way around the world when the books are this heavy.  Talk about an impact to the environment that is not necessary plus this could have easily been printed here in the USA.  I wish I had not ordered it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read the book the weekend before the movie was released.  I hear the movie is very good but the trailer scenes seems to be different from the book.  So, it is worth a read!  I loved it and couldn't put it down....
B005HSL626|4.0|A very fast playing game and is a lot of fun. The grand kids enjoy playing the game and we have a lot of fun with it goodtimes
B0093ST02E|4.0|I was very impressed with the quality of the acting and with the script.  I expected a romantic comedy with the standard format and this movie avoided that.  The photography was excellent.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is okay, still learning my way around.  I wish we could rotate buildings tho - unless we can and I just haven't found it yet.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This is a great CD from beginning till end.  It is a good addition to \\"19\\".  Buy now. Don't have anything else to say.  If it does not post this time, I will cancel my review.  LOL
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Interesting, direct, and very entertaining.  Well written and kept the space geek in me very satisfied.  I read the entire book in two very long sittings.
1439152802|4.0|I like Kate Morton.  This was an enjoyable reading and I could never have guessed the ending.  The different voices and stories make it interesting.  The story is completely believable, especially because it takes place during the WWII and life was very different and sometimes confused.  This is the third book that I read from Morton, and even if I liked the two others best, I enjoyed this book very much.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|What a great movie to speed you through the events of the 70's using the Beatles' songs to tell the story. The acting is great, the story is great and the music is unforgettable! Enjoy!
1596680296|5.0|I wanted to get started knitting socks and I already had a how-to book, but it just gave a basic pattern with little sizing options and you had to get the certain gauge they called for in the pattern. But my husband wanted thick worsted weight wool socks for work and unwanted cute self-striping sock weight socks...this book is EXACTLY what I needed. It explains the process perfectly. It has a zillion size options. I just knit my little swatch, figured out my gauge, flipped to the correct gauge sock pattern, and got to knitting up a sock. And it came out amazing! I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to make socks or is new to sock-making. You need this book. I have shown and recommended this book to every person I know who knits (except the sock expert).
B00628RVV0|5.0|This was an incredible movie!  A must see for its thought provoking story. What made it so powerful is its ability to successfully portray the Jews as \\"other\\" while making us all feel strongly for Bruno. The angst and stress the viewer feels is because it was \\"our\\" boy in that situation, not any of the others. And that's where the genius lies, we all got to feel a tiny sliver of what the real sufferers must have gone through. But only the tiniest sliver. And still it was terrifying.<br /><br />A brilliant film!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It actually is cutting edge technology that really could or may exist today!  The possibilities are endless with this program.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. I love hoe the police changes based on the theme. There is always a challenge that keeps you going. Awesome game!
076115678X|5.0|Life-changing!  An absolute must for anyone with curly hair.  I love showing off my curls now.  I get daily compliments.
B008UX2UIO|4.0|A truly original piece of work filled with unique and somewhat demented characters leading to an extremely well suited title.  However endearing the antagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly maybe, it became hard to overcome the irrevocable narcissism of his nature. Best put by Jones, Ignatius is a nuclear bomb of disaster. And where ever Ignatius goes hilarity follows.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Evidently, those writing negative reports have never read the book that the movie is based on.  This movie follows the book well and even some scenes are straight from artwork about the book and also included in the book.  This movie is treat for any real Tolkien fan.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Say what you will about her style or lifestyle, she is fantastic!  The melodies are catchy and even though I like her live arrangements better this does just fine to get me moving.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  Just wish it had the ultraviolet with the combo pack.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a great game, tons of dinosaurs to grow &amp; play with, you have both a land park and at level 10 can expand to an underwater park also.<br /><br />The game is a nice casual style of play to where you don't have to spend a lot of time playing unless you want to.<br /><br />It has options to buy certain things for real money that you can only get with the &quot;dollars&quot; currency but, the developers were nice and give you a couple dollars every level up.<br /><br />Problems:<br />First issue I had was the very first time I opened the app, every time I opened the app and it finished downloading it would instantly close, I found out it means you need to free up more memory on your device.<br /><br />Second issue just started happening only recently to where the game says it can't connect to download the content, I found the only fix for that was to delete my Facebook app and delete this app and reinstall this app and it fixed it. But I've had to keep Facebook deleted for it to continue to work.<br /><br />All in all a great game with alot of stuff to buy and do but, with a couple issues that'd be great if they were sorted out.
B003E8P9G0|3.0|When I think a book is too long is because it has failed completely to hook me on. I just wanted the book to come to an end. I thought the concept of the story is interesting, but there was too much flaws in the development of the plot, things come out of nothing or meaningless. Still I finished it, which means that it is not so bad. But I do not want to read another book in the series. I've had enough with this.
1555175163|4.0|Interesting how Bruce Lee's teacher is protrayed!  Some of the scenes are more part of legend than of facts.  No one can do all that the movies tries to convey!
B001224Z92|4.0|I avoided this album for years as when it was released, I didn't care for it. I thought the song writing was weak, and it was dreary and frankly sort of boring, this after being a major fan and owning every album up until that point. My musical taste then was going even more electronic - indutrial and EBM, so the new, more guitary, more subtle electronic elements on this album didn't enthuse me.<br /><br />As we are nearing the release of a new DM album I decided to give this one a chance. I find I like it. The production is top-notch. Everything about it is lustrious and dark, like the well worn, smooth wood of a church pew. It's quite a delight to listen to, in terms of the actual musical production.<br /><br />That said, it's not all good news. This album is the beginning of the DM albums that sound all the same to me, in terms of lyrics and song structure. Here Martin Gore first offers up the now standard Martin Gore bluesy solo song. Lesser variations of this  song have been repeated on every DM album since and they have worn out their welcome for this reviewer. In fact, this album is the blue-print for every DM album that follows, in terms of songwriting. This is where we hear for the first time the now common riffs, cords and slightly tweaked melodies that have plagued every album thereafter. At least here, they still have a spark of freshness, whereas on later albums they feel like bored retreads.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Not bad for the kids. Depp is good even as a cartoon character. Not a bad family movie. Thumbs up.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie starts off a little slow but when it gets going it is very good and would recommend it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This works great. I'm pretty sure the range is more than forty feet. The sound is incredible. I thought the surround sound was a gimmick. I mean how can you have surround sound with something covering your ears? However when I turned on the surround sound I felt like I was in a movie theater. My wife and I use it on the tread mill to watch programs. It really takes the boredom out of running on a tread mill.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is fun you get to jump over opsticals and it might be challengen at some time but once you play and play it is fun and really adecting.
B001AITGWE|4.0|So many reviewers point out this film juxtaposes two different men having problems in life, or a midlife crises, Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall, and that Robert Duvall's character handles this in a constructive way while the Michael Douglas character doesn't and goes off the deep end.<br /><br />That wasn't the way I saw it. Each time the narrative switches back to Robert Duvall, I saw something different. Duvall (a 50-something, professional,  married man) is about to begin a sexual relationship with his 20-something female partner. Their likely affair only serves as reason to sympathize more with Michael Douglas - someone who's been pushed too far (and to justify his anti-social actions in rebellion against a world that's threatening to run astray)?<br /><br />As the men engage in destruction and pursuit, the question remaining: will Duvall consumate the affair with his 20-something partner? and what of the possible sleeping arrangement of Michael Douglas' ex-wife?<br /><br />Falling Down is a morality play of sorts. There's the main theme and a secondary one of sexual fidelity. It's drifting just below the surface.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was when prim dies and finnick but at the end katniss eventually has children with peeta which i knew all along.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS game is the best. For FREE?!?!?!?! This game should be at lest 1$! you have to get it!Ps your time is worth it.
B005LAII08|5.0|Very funny movie and great for the kids.  Would be a better deal if they had the ultraviolet with the movie.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It is an interesting game. Kind of hard to understand at first have to work on it awhile. Getting better as you get used to it.
B00006JKOM|4.0|Far from being one of the best album of Jetro Tull, it is an album that you can't miss if you love the particular rock of the band. To mention the tunes &#34;too old to rock'n' roll too young to die&#34; and &#34;Pied Piper&#34;.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Life goes on at Downton with many surprises in store with births and deaths and everything in between.  As things change the family and staff of Downton are forced to change also.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found this to be the best Nicholas Sparks book yet. I loved it. It was a darker than his normal love stories, but it held my interest and made me cry, which I've never done reading any book. Great love story, easy read, and highly recommended.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is my new go-to game when I have some time to kill.  I like that it is a 3D version of a match game, which gives it a new spin.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I wish more Blu-ray movies had the ultraviolet and DVD in it because this gives you more options to let your kids watch the movie.

B008476HBM|5.0|For some reason I had never read this book. It was on our high school reading list but I made another choice. Once you get past the language and immerse yourself in the story I t was hard to put down.
0307389839|5.0|Because I love Haruki Murakami’s novels, and because in the last year I became very interested in running (which increased my interest in the books about running) I was very happy to finally be able to read what many people consider a cult running book – Murakami’s “What I talk about when I talk about running”.<br /><br />Murakami has been a runner for years (his results are on athlinks.com). I have actually seen him running along Charles river in Cambridge, as his stay there overlapped with mine.  In his very personal account of the running experience, he describes how he began running seriously. I really love how he writes about his successes and failures, his feelings while running training runs and races, and his evolving attitude to running.<br /><br />Because Murakami is a writer, his book is different that other runners’ accounts or advice on running. He simply writes better. He is able to make the reader feel his pain, elation, frustration, tiredness and pride associated with the training process and participation in races. I loved his first marathon choice – he ran the original route in reverse, from Athens to Marathon, alone, and wrote an article about his experience.  Also, his account of an ultramarathon in Japan (100 km race) is breathtaking, and his notes on the transition into triathlons are very honest.<br /><br />Sometimes he sounds a little too proud of himself – like when he comments on the female Harvard students passing him during his training runs in Cambridge – but this just makes the descriptions of his thoughts more believable and. He seems to be completely genuine, no matter what he writes, and this is also why I liked even his opinions on particular brands of running gear – they did not sound like a product placement at all, just a frank opinion on what he personally thinks is best for him. Particularly interesting are the thoughts on the impact of running on the rest of the author’s endeavors as a writer, pub owner and lecturer. Strikingly, he writes very little on his marriage and I would like to hear more on how he and his wife incorporate his running into their daily life as a couple, but I understand it might be a private matter.<br /><br />I will return to this book for sure, I understand why it is a cult book among runners, and I wish Mr. Murakami many more years of satisfying running and triathlons!nd lecturer.

B00AMBH70S|1.0|This was a horrible horrible film. I am a huge fan of the Bourne series but this one killed it for me. The story was stupid. The dialogue was bad. The concept was poor. These guys were clearly just looking to make a cheap buck off the popularity of the earlier movies. I'll never watch a sequel to this film ever.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  It is challenging and always different each time I play. I like that the plague can mutate and change, which makes it more challenging.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|While I wouldn't put this at the top of the angry birds franchise (a rank I reserve for the Star Wars version), my son loved this game none the less. Great creativity freeing the birds from the cages.
0545265355|5.0|Let me star off by saying, I read the entire series in a weekend, I know it sounds like I must have had an extremely boring weekend but I was addicted. It was an easy read and it kept my attention through out the entire series. The characters are so thought out, the plot isn't complicated and there is enough subtile hints to make you keep wondering about what will come. It's just a great series, I hae already reccomended it to several people I know. That alone should be enough encouragement to read them.
B00AOIKEZO|5.0|This is a lovely story, sometimes complicated but understandable and you do want the good ones to win. Highly recommend it for youngsters !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i cried about 15 times throughout the whole series and  this was really the perfect ending to the greatest book series ever
0812984412|4.0|This one is difficult to rate, with it falling somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars.  The difficulty lies in the nature of the book, having multiple stories of very different genres and POVs that nest within each other.  I actually came very close to ditching the book around the 20% mark.  I am glad that I decided to stick with it because I ended up enjoying most of the book.<br /><br />When considering my review, I realized that I had to consider the book two different ways, the book as a whole and then the stories on their own.  Throughout the book, David Mitchell’s use of language is fan-freaking-tastic!  Each story uses language in a very different way, but even in the stories that drag, the brilliance in his phrasing stood out to me.<br /><br />I thought that the nesting of stories within each other ultimately played out very well, however the first couple of transitions were a bit confusing.  I also liked the diversity of fiction which included some of my favorite genres: historical, dystopian, sci-fi, suspense, and humor.<br /><br />There are so many characters and themes tied up into this book that I think multiple reads might be necessary to fully appreciate all of the different elements.  I find my inner dork wanting to sit in a lit class lecture on the subtleties of the book.  I don’t think multiple reads or classes are necessary to find enjoyment in this book, I just think they might enhance the experience.<br /><br />Now, a few words about the stories, themselves.  I don’t want to outline each plot and give anything away, but I will say this.  The first two story lines introduced are the weakest.  The first one was ok, but I found I just could not make myself care about the second story (despite the lovely language usage).  It was at this point that I considered lemming the book.  Thankfully, I stuck with it because the third and remaining stories captivated me.<br /><br />While not a light or easy read, this was a good break from the ususal.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|haven't figured out why it swaps out the number pad for color pad yet or any other of the features
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great offshoot of Angry Birds for the times of the year. My son loved Halloween, so he loved blowing up the skeleton. I think he forgot the purpose of the game for this one, but will play it all day if we let him.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|love it very good to play went you donot have a lot to do around work or home. nice way to lost time and have a little of fun.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book was intriguing and thought provoking. Had difficulty putting the book down and have recommended it to others. . .
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Love being able to download digital music. Blown Away is awesome. Love the whole cd..actually all of Carrie Underwood's cds!
B0036BK6MW|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it then.  I really enjoyed the DVD!  It's one of those story lines that would be unbelievable, except that it is based upon actual circumstances of Michael Oher, All-American college football player and first round NFL draft pick.  I will admit it, I enjoy a heartwarming tale every once in a while, and sports movies always interest me.  This movie falls into both of those categories.  In my opinion, it would be a great movie for the family to watch together.<br /><br />The parade of college head football coaches (playing themselves) and the too precocious boy (SJ) are weak spots.  Although I'd imagine that young boys would look at SJ with admiration.  I felt the rest of the acting was top-notch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is an awesome game that is cool it is not always easy though other than that it is a great game
B009O2XY12|4.0|it's a very fun game.  As you  get into the various steps it becomes more of a challenge...I love to watch the little character at the bottom of the screen..I have more fun watching it go thru the different moves.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|You have far more detailed product reviews so I am going to state my simple opinion.  This is a very good Heavy Metal album.  The cover art may suck but I will forgive that.  Iron Maiden has all the principles of Heavy Metal as they have had from the beginning but are bringing a little more depth to their lyrical content.  I feel like the lyrics has matured a little more.  In no way am I belittling the older albums.  They are amazing and some of my Favorite all-time albums.  What I am saying is there seems to be a little more intellect and emotional content in their lyrics as the bands have progressed.  Though not part of this album, the song Brave New World is the evidence I will present for my case.  It's not only a dark theme, but a very meaningful one.  It has political implications under it's poetic facade.  I guess I'm glad to see that the music still reflects the band members as they are.  The members have grown wiser and more mature with age and so has their music in my person opinion.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|not fond of this one, it took too much patience to be accomplished at it.  for those that love math and work well in their head it would be fun
B0013D6LEM|5.0|An all time favorite of mine. I can never get tired of listening to most of MJ's music. Great ordering digital.

030758836X|4.0|I am not going to say that there were not times when I was reading this book when I thought to myself that it was going to be a train wreck. However, I ended up realizing that the author knew exactly what she was doing and that once you find out some important details, you end up marveling at her ability for communicating information through the style she uses in different parts of this book.<br /><br />Most people are familiar with the premise, marriage gone bad, wife disappears, and the husband is the main suspect of foul play. To tell you the truth though, I don't think this is the central point of the book at all. I think that the mystery is only an excuse to tell the readers about the ways in which a marriage can go awry. That is why even though you can pretty clearly figure out what happened one third into the book, and the author spells it out shortly after half the book is done, the appeal remains. It is more important to understand the why that to figure out who did what.<br /><br />I liked the use of alternating the first person narration between the husband and the wife. It starts with the husband talking about the time immediately before and after the disappearance, and the wife talking about when they met and how things progressed from there.<br /><br />I have seen many complain about the ending, but I thought it was brilliant. If it had come to a conclusion in a different way I would have felt that it was out of character with the rest of the story. I applaud the author for the guts to &#34;keep it real&#34;. The only reason why I took half a star away has to do with some loose ends the author left through the story, but compared to all the things she did right, it is a minor gripe. This is definitely a novel worth reading!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I over it I played the campaign 2 times who ever wants it get it I like the multiplayer too . my favorite is manhunt.

B003VS0CXS|5.0|but as an adult of normal patience, this must be the most boring film Ian Fleming was ever associated with!  It will put you to sleep<br />at it's 2 1/2 hour playing time....forget water boarding, I'd tell you anything not to watch this one again.  When the kids aren't watching I'm going to give it to my neighbor's pit bull as a toy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game awesome sounds. good effects.  hours and hours of fun. my mom got it fisrt then i had to have it. and now even my 3 yr old son plays it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game. Almost like temple runner but cool updates that give you even more cool prizes, characters, hoverboards, and more! For anyone who hasn't yet bought this game or ever heard about this game, buy it. Trust me.

B004G606K8|5.0|I first read the Dragonlance Chronicles in my teens about 20 years ago. I found then and now again the storytelling to be superb, the surrounding world rich and details, the characters intriguing and the plot captivating.<br /><br />I recommend this book and the ones following it to anyone with a little fantasy fan inside him :-)
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|Excellent story line, great action scenes. You can almost feel the bomber shake when they're flying through the flack. This DVD replaces my VHS tape that has been viewed by me too many times. Amazon price was less expensive than the store price.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great price, fast shipping, one of the best collections of movies out there. I would have bough this just for the 1st and 3rd movie if I had to.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Think it is better than the 10th anniversary version that I also have.  Can't wait for the movie version to be available.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|This is one of Eastwood's best works so far, it is not like you expect from him, Mose of his films are violence from the get go but this is a human nature story. It is showing the best and worst side of human nature
0393343405|4.0|This book is the history of how an epicurian poem, On the Nature of Things by Lucretius, was rediscovered by Poggio almost 600 years ago.  Greenblatt likens this finding as being partially responsible for the Renaissance and it's affects on Boticelli, Darwin, Freud, Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson's work. The poem was very controversial as it espoused that there was no afterlife and that the world existed without God or gods.  The swerve was the motion of \\"atoms\\" and matter that did not depend on a higher being.  Simplistically, it encouraged people not to fear death, but pursue happiness.<br /><br />I read this for our book club.  I probably would not have read it otherwise, as I've only had one class in philosophy and found if hard to get into.  However, I'm glad that I did read it.  I find I read many more subjects and genres by belonging to book clubs, and therefore, stretch my mind a bit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love  it just great it's so awesome<br />Great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great love love love love love love love love love love

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Rovio really outdid themselves on this game! The graphics are amazing, with a clever relation to the sequence the movies followed. Every Angry Birds and Star Wars fan should experience the pleasure in which I received from this game!
B008XCJ03K|4.0|Unique sound. Haven't really listened to the lyrics but it is an enjoyable departure from mainstream music. (Three more words)
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I can't get past level one, but I've never done well with angry birds.  It takes a lot of time just doing the same thing over and over.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis and the others are just great.  It is funny and so very enjoyable that I could watch it a few times a week.
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|One of the most memorable and unique family friendly shows of the last decade. Once is filled with magic, wonder, and hope.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I love this movie, definately a must have for action lovers. . . . . . . . . .
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a really good tool to open your eyes and be able to communicate more effectively in a marriage.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|The movie was good. But the reason it gets so many stars is because the music is awesome. Not a bad movie though.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Well reasoned arguments showing the fallacy of religion. Dawkins' style can come off as abrasive to some, but is refreshingly candid to others like myself.  He does not apologize for his candor, nor should he.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I absolutely loved the series, since I love history and this really very interesting.  I honestly believe this was how most of actors acted as the true person..  I am also assuming they had to do much research to get all in order and correct.  Naturally they have to add an interest ( family issues), but that is what makes the history fun and interesting to read.<br /><br />So, to me this is an excellent way to see our history of our country, instead of learning dates etc.  in this mini series you see and feel like you were there.  I wish history could be taught in this manner...students would remember just what happened and why!
B003297I1U|5.0|My son loves it!  It is as sturdy as it looks.  All moving parts add to the endless creativity.  I'm sure it will be used for many years to come.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00AW0KGYI|3.0|they dident have in the store i had to go online to get mine i got part1 and too at walmart but not this box only oline its better lots more of the book in this new one so buy one if not this box one
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Really great album. Highly recommend this to anyone who like that west-coast sound that's full of bubbly charm. Great album to listen to with the car top down or sun roof open.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I expected more from this movie. I thought it was going to blow me away. It wasn't a bad movie, in fact it was a really solid movie, but it was not as good as I had suspected.
B005KH928E|5.0|This album is incredible.  This is the type of stuff that Clapton still shines on.  His vocals are fantastic, and he has a few incredible guitar moments that you can tell even wows this insanely tight band.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Was surprised when I first watched this series that I was instantly taken with the plots and drama amoung the many interesting characters.  Have found myself on the edge of my seat each week.  Sometimes crying, sometimes cheering, sometimes holding my breath.  A great series that delivers excitement and keeps one coming back for more.  Not for young viewers by any stretch!!
B000001F7R|1.0|Run of the mill radio rock with no memorable songs or anything worth listening to more than once.  Pass on this you have already heard it, trust me.  If you listen to any of Leppards stuff except the new camp rockish sounding stuff (im not kidding) it all sounds the same.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Lude & crude. Repetitive sex scenes, language, copy & paste scenarios throughout the book. Must be open minded/adventurous sexually to enjoy this series.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|higher  level of details, and more involved plot. Not really the craft, but entertaing!Watch it, and rewatch it.You will like it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The plot was very interesting, but I am not sure why this movie got so many awards. I guess Ben Affleck did a great job as director and lead actor,  but I don't thnkl the movie itself was worth all the accolades.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|If you like sci-fi as I do, that means you put aside your feelings of disbelief for a while and accept what happens in the film/series as is. I have recently re-watched ALL the &#34;X-Files,&#34; and &#34;Fringe&#34; is right up there with the best. I can't wait to get started on &#34;Fringe: The Complete Fourth Season!&#34;
B004HD61KE|5.0|another James Rollins novel that keeps you riveted from the outset. Exactly what I expect in a book by my favorite author.
B000001DVD|1.0|Just another boring leppard radio rock yawnfest that's better left high and dry.  Trust me, you have already heard it.
B0093LFGMO|5.0|I've bought some of Robbie Williams' CDs in the past, and although they have been good, they always seemed to either be missing something or became tiresome 1/2 way through.  Not so with &#34;Take the Crown&#34;.  I really love this CD.  I have listened to it several times through and could listen to it again tomorrow.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone familiar with Robbie Williams' previous work.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Thanks to Amazon e-mail updates, I never would have known about the release of this amazing album from Justin Hayward! Before that, the \\"Higher and Higher\\" website was the \\"go to\\" place for updates on Justin Hayward and The Moody Blues, when it was in operation. As I have done with my past reviews, I focus more on the music and instrumentation rather than the lyrics, because the sound and melodies grab my attention first!<br /><br />Like most Moody Blues albums, this release starts off with the energetic and uplifting \\"In Your Blue Eyes,\\" which reminds me of \\"I Heard It,\\" the opening track from Justin's \\"The View From The Hill\\" album. At a couple of points in the song, there are brief backing vocals that sound like they were sung by John Lodge!<br /><br />\\"One Day, Someday\\" reminds me of both the original version of \\"Broken Dream,\\" from \\"View From The Hill\\" and \\"Bless The Wings That Bring You Back,\\" from \\"Keys of the Kingdom,\\" and I love the beauty in the sound of the orchestral flourishes that are scattered throughout the track. :)<br /><br />\\"The Western Sky\\" has a similar sound to John Lodge's \\"Love Don't Come Easy,\\" from \\"Strange Times,\\" and I like how we get the \\"bee buzz\\" electric guitar that was best heard on Moody Blues albums like \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\" :) I also like the \\"Days of Future Passed\\" orchestral intro and finale, which bookend the track!<br /><br />\\"The Eastern Sun\\" sounds just as lovely as \\"Who Are You Now,\\" from \\"Blue Jays\\" and \\"Children of Paradise,\\" from \\"View From The Hill,\\" with the beautifully played folk-style guitars ... \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably,\\" from \\"On The Threshold of a Dream,\\" comes to mind too. :)<br /><br />\\"On The Road To Love\\" is like another \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" (\\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\"), when it comes to the beat, with a bit of \\"Lovely To See You\\" (\\"On The Threshold of a Dream\\"), plus the vocal arrangements remind me of the choruses from \\"You and Me\\" (\\"Seventh Sojourn\\")!<br /><br />\\"Lazy Afternoon\\" is like yet another \\"Broken Dream,\\" and the dreamy keyboard effects add a nice heavenly touch to the songs, plus the \\"bee buzz\\" electric guitar returns again. :)<br /><br />\\"In The Beginning\\" sounds like it could have fit in with the \\"Journey Into Amazing Caves\\" soundtrack, since it contains sound elements from both of the Moody Blues composed tracks, \\"Water\\" and \\"We Can Fly.\\" Excellent work on the vocal arrangements on that track. :)<br /><br />The remake of \\"Cold Outside of Your Heart\\" doesn't bother me a bit, and the fancy guitar work and country-style backing vocals were well delivered.<br /><br />\\"What You Resists Persists\\" has that \\"Troubadour\\" (\\"View From The Hill\\") sound, another bluegrass delight!<br /><br />For me, the original \\"Broken Dream\\" was my favorite between the two versions ... This version seems to have more of a \\"cute\\" sound to it while the original version had more of a heavenly and blissful sound to it. Still, this take was still enjoyable for me. :)<br /><br />\\"Captivated By You\\" is like a more uplifting \\"Billy\\" (Again from \\"View From The Hill\\") sound-alike, plus reminds me of David Gilmour/Later \\"Pink Floyd\\" on the choruses.<br /><br />Sounds like Justin was keeping up with the times when it came to the trilogy at the end of the album ... Never thought I would hear a \\"dance/techno\\" rendition of \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" with brand new (...and powerful!) recorded vocals, but I really enjoyed it a lot and the whole sound gave me a natural high and brought back that \\"energetic and uplifting\\" feeling, once again! I like the effect of Justin's \\"muddled\\" vocals becoming more and more audible and clearer, at a couple of points during the final track. :)<br /><br />Well, with all of the references to other songs/albums that I have made, hopefully I have opened up new listeners to other Justin Hayward and Moody Blues material, for those who have discovered this album first. :) I loved how \\"Spirits\\" has the sound of previous Justin Hayward and Moody Blues material, because I usually like when an artist or band keeps their unique \\"sound\\" and doesn't go too far to try a different style to mix things up ... Justin put out an album that was just right for my musical tastes. No matter what all of us fans hope for in regard to the future of Justin and The Moody Blues, I was extremely satisfied with \\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\" and treated it like \\"The New Moody Blues\\" album, plus I have enjoyed it just as much as fan favorites like the \\"Core Seven\\" Moody Blues albums. Any creation from Justin Hayward and The Moody Blues puts me in good spirits. :) Thank you for reading and God Bless! ~Best wishes from \\"KevyGuy\\" :)tin Hayward and Moody Blues material, because I usually like when an artist or band keeps their unique \\"sound\\" and doesn't go too far to try a different style to mix things up ...

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book to read. Gives insight on a new experience. Easy to follow and understand. Definitely a good book to read.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|This book was not easy to follow and didn't really have a plot. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Countdown is one of the best thrash metal albums ever made and everyone knows this. This set has a bonus live show from the cow palace that makes this set special.  The housing is great, easy to open and secure when closed, the extra photo cards are great too, very nice yet, amazing bonus disc. \m/
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|LOVE IT. I cant play but it is fun to try.  Grand children love it too.  Fun songs easy and hard to play.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|This program may be fine for little ones, but not necessarily for fine detailing, straight line work or shading that would be required by adults.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It is a good book. I thought it was a romance story but it turned out to be better than that. As a mother, the flashbacks were very sad and heartbreaking to read, and angering to later find out that they were based on true accounts. But the story was also very funny, downright hilarious in parts and I really enjoyed reading it. I love the Irish dialect and speech. Good job!
1401938906|4.0|I consider myself a manifesting machine so I was delighted to hone my skills when I received this book from Hay House for review. I dived in right away, as excited as a kid on Christmas morning.<br /><br />Pam Grout is a witty writer that takes you on an entertaining ride through her own manifestations, case studies of many others, and details how to set up easy experiments to see results yourself. She asks the cynics to suspend their disbelief just for the duration of each experiment. Most take a mere forty-eight hours. What's the worst that can happen? Well, the worst that can happen is that nothing happens. And after forty-eight hours, you can pick up your cynicism and go back to being skeptical. No harm done. But when you think of what you can gain and how you can harness your own powers, it's too fun not to try. Go on, you know you want to....<br /><br />What were my results? Pretty good! I whizzed through most the experiments with great success, save for one I'm still waiting on. I effortlessly manifested unexpected gifts, butterflies and sunset beige sedans, and had fun harnessing my energy with hangers (yes, hangers!). But I have yet to uncover where my new tablet, Lululemon yoga gear and trip to California are hiding. Twenty minutes after starting this particular experiment, I got an email for a chance to win a trip to California along with a $500 gift certificate to...that's right...Lululemon! \\"YES!\\" I yelled while feverishly typing in my details, making my husband jump out of his seat in the process. \\"Now I just need that tablet,\\" I said, facing him after pressing the submit button. We locked eyes for a moment before turning back to our respective computer screens. He's been promising to buy me a tablet since my birthday a few months ago.<br /><br />Depending on your own results, you may throw out your cynicism like a dried up Christmas tree in January. While you once found it useful, you no longer need it. As for me, I know those last items will show upat any moment. Even if my husband ends up buying them all for me, just so I stop talking about them.<br /><br />Full Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from Hay House for review purposes. The opinion expressed is my own and unbiased.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really useful app. I know when it's charging and u can see what features use up all your battery and how much Bart life u have left for each app.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This Austen classic is full of wit; you'll notice more and more each time you read it. It really gets better with age!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is another great cd from the RHCP. Lots of good tunes and really, I listen to the cd all the way through. Every song is likable.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book was riveting from the start. I love the way Michael Connelly spins a story. Some times slow and methodical leaving nothing to guess at, and other times speeding ahead so that your head spinning.  I can't wait to read the next Harry Bosch novel. It will be like saying goodbye to an old friend once Detective Bosch retires.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry keeps you on the edge of your seat with every twist and turn. Great read, easy to follow, can't put it down.
B006LSZECO|2.0|You can write a book without excessive vileness. The story was good you keep on going thinking the language will improve - it doesn't.  The story wraps you up and Keeps you going. The twists and turns are things that prod you on passed the vileness. The ending disappoints. Truly I wasted my time.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Works great,  However like all free things they have a way to get your money.  Fortunately the grandkids do not know what they don't have
B0000DZEE3|4.0|The live show is nice. I wish they'd have played some other songs, such as Dosed, and maybe some behind the scenes content. But overall, the dvd sounds good and is a nice watch. If you like the RHCP, you'll enjoy this!

B007JCP8FE|5.0|This album is amazing but if your looking for another SOM this is not it. But just like SOM you will be smiling, crying and rocking out.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|nice selection, love the timer!  would recommend to anyone.  I think I'll be using this most nights to doze off.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|After hearing so much about this show, we were not disappointed!  We cannot wait to see the next installment, but we do not want it to end!
B008P1EWIM|1.0|why i dislike weather  i dont want to pay for this sence i cant get weather live so why pay
B003UBTX7C|4.0|It's a very interesting story.It keeps you guessing as the plot keeps changing.The only negative is that there are too many characters to keep track of.
B0087WRGVY|5.0|Hands down the best CD I have bought in 10 years. Great vocals, drums, bass and guitars. These guys will have your feet tapping and your body moving from the 1st note to the last note.

1589949811|5.0|Solid balanced rules, not too easy, lots of replayability right out of the box.  Excellent art, the theme comes through and living card games are an excellent format for this co-op game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I don't have a horse at home but I feel like I have one on my kindle!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but everyone and awhile it acts like it is gonna freeze but it still works and I love this app
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I find this to be a beautiful movie. When I saw it in the theater it really inspired me. The DVD has reinforced my opinion. compared to most other horror films, this is a little less rugged, lacking gratuitous violence, but that quality allows room for other aspects to shine.  Sound and picture were quality great. I recommend this title highly. Also, look into Flatliners and Jacob's Ladder for inspiration wrapped in scary package.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|If you like music from the early 70's you'll enjoy this CD.  I wonder why Rodriguez wasn't better known back in the 70's.  He certainly deserves his new found fame.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|No gripes about the disc quality or amazon. But the movie itself was pretty weak. Boring story line and difficult to understand what the actors are saying. The accents combined with the special effects sounds made some moments completely incomprehensible.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|During and after reading this series I started telling everyone I know that they need to read it because it is fabulous!  I am a big fan of dystopian novels, and this is one of the best I have read so far. Do not miss out on this book!
B007OLYQ4E|2.0|I thought the book was hard to follow, and uninteresting.  I love the movie--perhaps the beautiful actors from long ago.
0062238310|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and was rewatching season 1 recently. Then I discovered this-- the commentary from the author is such a treat. It's a new and different way to experience Downton. Very indepth, and you get to focus on the language, which is beautiful and crisp. The deleted scenes are fascinating as well. Good to see how editing works in the world of film/tv. I only wish they would hurry up and release book 2 in the US-- I get the impression it's already out in the UK.
B000KX0HVY|1.0|I love Elvis and consider this to be one of the better collections offered on CD of his music.  Great songs!!
B0037VNX44|4.0|I Watched this movie because I am a huge Tom Hardy fan. I think he is an extraordinary actor. I thought the movie was pretty good. He played the part very well. Looking forward to seeing more of Tom Hardy's work.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Simple game. Not totally mindless, or I couldn't play it, but it gets boring after a while. This is one I can go back to when I've conquered another game, because this one is always different, and I can't win every time.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|If you're a Belieber you probably already have this album.  It's great, there's nothing as good as Justin Bieber doing acoustic!  I love all his albums and listen to them all the time, but this one seems special all by itself.  I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is great I loved it and you are going to.love it too I also love the new world tour
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I think this would be interesting to someone who has an unsatisfied love life or marriage. Most of the book is consumed with jumping each others bones and arguing. The plot so far is less than exciting but I am going to read final book and give a final thought then
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|The movie had an interesting horror and crime mix as a premise. But, then, the end was predictable. The movie was gripping 70% but the end just fizzles out.<br />Acting was good. Story was ok.
1439102732|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors and her portrayal of the main characters in all of her books are very well researched.  This book was no exception.  I couldn't put it down!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's something to do to fill the time. Nothing special about it. It's easier to win than Spider Solitaire, which makes it more boring.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the Trilogy. It was great i couldn't put the book down. I can't wait for the movie next summer.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Has a really small size, for al the &#34;power&#34; it stores. Has to output USB ports, one twice as fast as the other one for charging. This is a great product for trips, emergencies, etc you can have a lot of extra power..
B005GFPZYK|4.0|But, ordinary guys make extraordinary heros. Chris Kyle tells his story with unabashed honesty - the good, the bad and the ugly. A truly good read straight from the heart and soul of a trained killer who lived lived for years on the dark side yet managed to stumble back into society. Remarkable.
B00498YZH8|2.0|its like a Lifetime cable channel movie..if you know what i mean...not bad, but not a thriller ..dont believe the 4 or 5 star reviews
1616550414|4.0|It is full of interesting information and fantastic artwork from throughout the series.  It is a nice piece for any Zelda fan to add to their collection.
B0068TL23G|4.0|I guess I'm a bit of a perfectionist. It's not OK for me to just pass a level.  I have to get a perfect score. The idea here is to connect the two dots of the same color without crossing another line. It's not just pass or fail. You can get just one star if you connect but use a longer route than necessary. Five stars means you got the shortest rout possible. Of course it gets harder and harder! I've played many, many levels, and I haven't beaten the game yet. I have all my stars on everything I've passed though! I didn't give it 5 stars because it is frustrating me! I may be stuck! Where is the satisfaction in that? Probably not the game's fault...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|it was a quick read but it was a very good series.<br />i would recommend this book to anyone that wants a good quick read.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My 4 year old daughter and I have watched this movie 4 times in the past 2 days. Between a tattooed, sword wielding  Santa, an Aussie Easter Bunny, a lovable tooth fairy, Sandy the whip wielding sandman, and the protagonist Jack Frost (who is in a journey of self discovery) it has been enjoyable each and every time. To make it even a little more magical, it snowed last night and my daughter was soooo excited to wake up and realize that Jack Frost had come to visit. The overall moral of the story is that there is fear in the world, just there is no need to be scared of it. Also to be true to your friends and what you believe in, they will always be there for you. A worthy purchase. My daughter has not loved a movie like this in such a long time. I could not be happier!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is great have enjoyed all three seasons, each season withs it's ending leaving you to watch and want more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I see a movie in the making..... it will be great just like the book, I couldn't put it down.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|My wife loved these Celtic Women.  She had the CD in her car.  She passed away five weeks ago.  I listen to the music and it helps me.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|A bit of a challenge, but not interesting enough to make the game worth my time. If I have nothing else to read or play in a waiting room I may go to this game, but as soon as I find something better it's gone.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|If there is one book you have to read in your lifetime, it is this one. Anita Moorjani' s story not only takes us through her journey from cancer, near death and healing but more importantly through a journey of insight, wisdom and grace.<br /><br />Words cannot express how BLESSED I felt reading her experiences where the lessons gained are so POWERFUL and beneficial to anyone on any path.<br /><br />There's an old Chinese proverb that says: \\"A single conversation with a wise man is better than ten years of study.\\" That is exactly how I felt reading Anita Moorjani's 'Dying to Be Me.' It felt like a conversation with a wise man or rather wise woman.<br /><br />This book touched me at my core and resonated with my whole being. It took me to another level of spiritual awareness and facilitated an expansion within me that words cannot express.<br /><br />Thank-you so much Anita Moorjani for sharing your Self with the world.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I make all kinds of lists with this app. No more little scraps of paper around the house with random thoughts.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|We all love Brave from the little ones to the parents to the grands.  It is a movie that we will watch over and over.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|this is well worth the money spent, Adele is excellent in it, I highly recommend the purchase . . .
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I was a little shocked about how addictive this show is.  I have recommended it to at least everyone at work and my family and they all love it.  Ages ranging from 20 to 70.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game if very interesting.  Keeping me into wanting more and to see how far I can go. I love it.
B004P7CNUY|5.0|I think this is the best Michael Myers movie of all of them.  Worked great shipped fast , and great price.  Thanx &#34;D&#34;.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Takes great pictures. I didn't give 5 stars cuz I haven't had a chance to play with extras. I would recommend this app to kindle fire users who plan to use Skype.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Watched the movie. Thought Craig's acting was worse than usual and there were so many unrealistic components I couldn't even begin to count them. The plot was pretty much entirely ripped off of Mission Impossible, which is only one single major example of this exact story being told on the big screen. Seriously what was up with the beginning? It looked like someone took Pink Floyd album artwork and made a 5 minute movie intro out of it... Needless to say there was no lack of bad guys with machine guns that couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. No lack of unnecessarily exposed women. No lack of action scenes. Certainly no lack of James Bond doing what he does which is mostly females (usually!?!?!) and scotch. The movie was &#34;meh&#34; at best for me. I watched it because I had to. Who can resist the newest Bond film? Regardless of how good it is everyone HAS to see it... That's just how Bond movies are.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love it. We all take turns to see who can get the furthest. Power ups add more fun to the game also.
B0063GORYU|4.0|solid app. appreciate the good work. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I just wanted to try &#34;streaming video&#34; and I picked one of my favorites to watch.  The video and sound was good and I enjoyed revisiting the first episode of a great series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best my little brother will never stop playing it. I also can't stop playing the game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of the only apps that I enjoy. It is challenging as well as fun. Another good game to get is temple run.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Everyone can send and receive emails from anywhere or any device.  Love Yahoo Mail.  I have had an address for years.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Disney movie Pollyanna.  Received it for Christmas, (along with a new kindle) so then I wanted to read the books.  I had read them years ago, but it was fun to read them again.  If you read the first, you have to read the second, Pollyanna Grows Up. They are both wonderful, classic books, and will make you want to play the Glad Game!
B00821OX98|5.0|This show had me hooked right away! It falls right into the action and just keeps going strong throughout the season. Definitely a good pick for sci-fi fans.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|It keeps shutting down.<br />  while using and trying to orient my mind it keeps shutting down not enough time to see anything.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this in Jr. High, but could hardly remember a word, so it was so refreshing to read again and this time to relate to Marmie as a mentor of sorts. This book will always be one of the greatest classics ever written.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw my husband using this game and tie it out... pretty soon it was on my kindle and I found it rather addicting..  I love to play it when I am in the airport or have so much on my mind I need a distraction.  The first games are easy... but as you get up into the games it requires a lot more thought..... Great mind boggling game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is the most most fun game in the whole wide world.I love this game because it gets your brain to think fast.
B008OOYALE|5.0|LOVE the game and the detail put into the dragons. Hours of fun. Really enjoy the quests. Only wish there was a way to level faster without gold.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|The whole concept of the game is for a decent timewaster.. however it lacks what the game needs to really make it worth the time.<br />It has no tutorial to tell you the objective, and puts you right out on the track, that seems endless i might add, and expects you to automatically know what you are doing.<br />The music is just a loop of a crappy drum beat over and over and each platform you are on plays a different guitar/piano chord when you land on it, which is never on time with the beat, so, as a musician, this is big deal to me.<br />The control of the marble itself might as well be nonexistent as well. The tilt controls are too stiff and too slow. When i opened the game and started the first explorer level, my marble just fell off the first platform. No warning of game start or anything.<br />All in all, if you like a challenge right from the start, i challenge you to find another marble game. One of the best of these games of all time can be found on the original regular nintendo, and it is called Marble Madness. If you are looking for something similar but better built, i  would recommend Cube, from the appstore.<br />However, if this minor review isnt satisfactory, i recommend downloading it while it is still the FAOTD, and experience it for yourself!
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I was recommended this book by a trainer with great experience. I was browsing at it on my kindle and accidentally purchased it.  I thought oh well and decided not to mark it as a mistake.  I can't put it down.  Everything is common sense information.  I haven't gotten through the book but I recommend this to anyone that wants a better relationship with their dog, wants to be a trainer or just wonders what their dog is thinking.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My sisters had been encouraging me to watch this and I'm glad I did!  Good story and keeps you interested.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I had heard many good things about this series and decided to give it a shot. Substrates off interesting, and stayed that was for quite some time. Got a little better, then fell back down, etc etc...but by the end I could hardly tear my eyes from it and now eagerly look forward to the next book. It's got all your classic fantasy elements, so for anyone a fan of the high fantasy genre I really must recommend this book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really loved these books and would recommend them to my friends. These are books I would not normally read but I heard people talk about the first book so I decided to give them a try and I am glad I did. I love them....
6305971099|2.0|I did not like it. This is just another resurection of Michael Myers. The plot was weak and not fun at all.
B001NTCSCK|5.0|I got this primarily for Winds of Change, but there are some more good tunes on this.album. Not my usual listening material, but it is one of the better &#34;heavy metal&#34; bands I've heard.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|For the most part I love this book.  There are moments that do drag on but that just has to do with my feeling on that particular character.  I love the books though and I tell everyone to read them.
1607066017|5.0|The worst part of Saga is the title. It's so boring. The rest of the book is better than almost anything else being done in comics.<br /><br />This book is not appropriate for little kids. In other words, it doesn't speak down to you even when employing bathroom humor. There is some violence. There is some sex.<br /><br />The characters are adorable, even the villains. It's hard to tell who are the villains and who are the heroes, but the tendency seems to be that the mixed couple and their baby are the heroes.<br /><br />The art and dialogue are exceptionally innovative.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan. I am NOT one of those who goes to conventions and pretends to be \\"Marktar from the fifth quadrant of Machupichu heir to Moloran\\", but I LOVE Trek over Wars any day of the week. Kirk would shove the force up Luke's lightsaber then go home and get a green chick, blindfolded the whole time, while holding off Chuck Norris with one hand tied behind his back any day of the week.  Yes, he is that hardcore.  If your a fan you must have this collection. I think the Fifth movie was kind of boring but the rest are amazing. I do have to admit that I think the best part of ANY of the movies is in Trek 4 The Voyage Home. Checkov running up to a cop asking \\"vere do you keep the necular wessals\\" in 1987, durring the cold war... come on it doee not get any funnier than that....  KAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Good video to watch if your interested on what goes on with food supplies and the impact to your health
B0009RCPY8|4.0|I purchased this set, because I loved ghostbuster when I was a kid. I must say the original movie is good, but the second movie has a terrible story. Anyway, they are a classic.
B004Y042N8|3.0|Good game if you need to waste some time - whether that is sitting at home waiting on dinner or waiting on your GF while she is in the store shopping.
0736656669|2.0|I'm about 60% of the way through this book and Diamond still has not told me why certain cultures have overtaken other cultures. He writes extensively about agriculture, livestock, writing and geography of different cultures but goes way overboard with these topics. The back cover of the book stated that Diamond was going to tell me why certain races or cultures conquered other races or peoples but it should not take me 60% of the book to get to these points. Many of these chapters seem like fluff in order to get to the 400 page mark. He's also a white apologist which totally burns my ass. Every race and culture is different. Some do things better or differently than others. And every race has comitted atrocious crimes throughout history. You'd have to read the book to understand this claim but its pretty obvious if you do. A scholar of his credential should tell it like it is not make apologies and false excuses for the crimes of whites througout history while excluding the same crimes of other races and cultures. He certainly did his research but that doesn't make up for the monotonous lecture of why certain animals are able to be domesticated and why certain plants grow here or there. Very misleading cover front and back.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|All-around a fantastic app. The porn ads were just icing on the cake! 6/5 stars--by far the best app available anywhere.
B0086213XW|5.0|I loved the slow pace, and I also hated it. Not sure what to think but every step was very unpredictable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an excellent TV program.  The writer lets us into the thoughts and lives of the Lords and Ladies as well as the downstairs staff.
B00008GKEG|5.0|There is not much to say about the Beatles. This anthology is just awesome, I purchased for a friend and he loves it.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|I'm glad this was a free app when I found it.  I would have been upset with myself if I had paid anything for it.  You can either have a positive spin on &#34;time-waster&#34; or a negative one.  This is definitely a negative time-waster
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing!! It gives you lots of adrenalin.. Make sure you collect ALL the coins!! And watch out tot the trains! Collect anything that shines or sparkles!!(:
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great story as always, from Grisham. I loved it. I did, as in many of his stories,  wait for something to happen at the end, and for them to lose it all.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|I was a big fan of the first 4 Killers records. Sam's Town and Sawdust took a couple of listens to grow on me, but I loved them both. I have listened to this album 4 times through. But it hasn't grown on me at all. The lyrics are all pretty good. They have a Bruce Springsteen type of vibe, but the music seems to be kind of slack. It's almost like the guys wrote the lyrics and took their time, and separately put music to them. It doesn't have a very dynamic mood like the records did. The first 5 songs on Battle Born are not bad, but the album gets pretty lazy and slow. This is the worst Killers album to date. Especially considering that Day and Age was so good. It's a let down. But I think that any big fan of the group would want to have this album anyway.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|The writer establishes his characters in depth.  They become real and then we get hooked and look for more and more.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I purchased this lantern to light up a 10 x 20 pop up canopy.  My intention was not to find a lantern to provide reading quality light for the entire area but enough to have ample light to carry on necessary activity and this easily does the job.  As I was looking for a lamp to use at work as well as a spare emergency lamp for home use, I ordered this lamp and a similar Rayovac model.  Aside from the obvious exterior color difference, they look almost identical.  Other reviewers have done a much better job distinguishing the two (led unit, light diffuser, etc.) but my main concern was usable light.  This lantern to me produces a brighter, whiter light and at a better price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Size<br />Needs only 3 D batteries<br />Carrying/hanging handle, hanging hook on bottom (while rather flimsy plastic, more than enough to do the job)<br /><br />Cons:<br />For the price, none so far<br /><br />While I have not had this lantern long enough to personally attest to battery life/long term use, I can say IMO if I were to order another lantern and I had to chose between this model and the Rayovac, I would definately chose this model.  While both lanterns may not have produced even, perfect light throw, I did not feel it fair to list as a con considering the price and my intended use and expectations.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|What could be a delightful excursion skirting issues of 'fringe' science is utterly obscured by one-dimensional cardboard cutout characters making it extremely difficult to identify with any of the emotional issues they may have to overcome. Having watched six straight episodes of season one I still find I am unable to sense or empathize with the character Olivia played by Anna Torv an Australian actress who is supposed to be struggling with great emotional pain inflicted by her former lover. Not only does she fail to connect with her audience you find yourself having quite the opposite reaction sought; you want to wipe the ever present smirk off her face. It isn't only her character. Having seen many other shows with the other actors starring in important roles, it is my opinion that the writing is lacking more so than the acting.<br /><br />Still, I admire FOX for trying to bring mainstream issues of science that are actually being tackled within the hallowed halls of universities all over the world. If you find you have 45 minutes to waste, there are worse ways.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much i play subway surfer all the time! It is verry addictive! Ive definitely been hooked -
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is easy to operate -even if you are not well versed in video games.  Also, it does operate in such a way that I can &#34;learn&#34; and make adjustments.
1881273377|5.0|i bought this after hearing Oprah talk about the book on an old show.<br />It is really easy to understnad and totally makes sense and I was able to adjust my way of thinking really easily in order to please my partner, really positive!
B00007KWHG|4.0|I just downloaded the MP3 version of this CD from Amazon for $2.99!!!  I used the Amazon Cloud to transfer the album to my I-Tunes account.  It sounds crisp and clear.  Every song track listed for the CD is included the MP3 download, so there aren't any missing tracks.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia Keys has been one of my favorite female artists. She is both innovative and gifted in her musicality, and I can totally relate to the lyrics to each and every song. This is a must have for anyone who is an Alicia Keys fan. I truly treasure this creative process, which was obviously well thought out and planned. Kudos to Alicia.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is new to my daughter but she loves it.  she is still learning all the fun things you can do. highly recommend
6300274187|5.0|This item could have been shipped media mail, but instead it was here in two days by express shipping. Of course, the movie is wonderful as well. A classic from my childhood that I was anxious to share with my daughter. It is not as fast-paced as modern movies, so she is not thrilled with some of the longer dance sequences. What child should grow up without knowing the words to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious or enjoying the wonderful interaction between Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews? Even better, compared to more modern kids movies, not one crude joke!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I can hardly put this book down I've enjoyed it so much. Darren Hardy explains just how important it is to make those small changes that in the long run will have huge differences from the others who don't make those small improvements. A must read in my opinion.
0061743526|5.0|well, of course this was a signed copy so there are not many aorund. My partner did not expect such a crazy cool present and cried from surprise.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Somewhat simplified, and some inaccuracies, but so well written you don't notice till later!  The series wasn't even on my radar until the movie came out on DVD.  I was able to purchase the first and last in the series in paperback, but when I checded the prices, I ended up purchasing this one on my Kindle.
B00AJLHULW|4.0|The album is very well produced. Been an RF fan for many years, and, unlike other posts, am not disapointed. It is a laid back album. People get lambasted sometimes for laid back albums, like Rita Coolidge's \\"Nice Feeling.\\" Bottom line...I like it a LOT.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this to see  what all the fuss was about. I still don't get it. I agree with other reviewers that the text badly needs an editor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. I can't seem to put it down. Its like my addiction. I love it and I recommend everyone to download it now.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|Wow.. great graphics, awesome soundtrack. But extremely difficult. After trying for about an hour on easiest level i only made it to the third platform...  I don't<br /><br />reccomended becaus it is impossible to plAy....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I held my breath and clenched the kindle in my hand until the very end. Everything she felt, I felt. I was Katniss.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|I first watched it years ago and it hasn't lost it's punch.  Michael Pare is a favorite actor of mine, but a little wooden in this one.
B0058VW36U|1.0|It will not work on my Visual land android tablet. I really wanted this game and i am really bummed that it wont work for me!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible! I literally could not put it down. It's been 45 seconds since I read read the last sentence, and I already miss Katniss and Peeta!<br />Can't wait to start the next book :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The new version for Android has the ENDLESS survival finally.  I previously gave this one star because it was only half the game that Ipad users got but now the Android version is a full version.  Love it.
B00008NRL8|5.0|I listen to this music in the car, and especially in moments with my husband.  Great Romantic and fun music
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game very much, . It is very addictive, I play just about every before bed and on my way to work
B004JOCU2O|5.0|one of those movies you watch over and over! acting is fabulous, cinematography is well done, story line is riveting
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book<br />It's very detailed and descriptive<br />It's also kind of sad<br />I really liked this book
B00992CF6W|3.0|When u play it for 3 months or more it will not save your progest on kindle fire and the price is outraged
B008G12ERC|2.0|Muse is very inspirational,<br />this album would be their magnus opus<br />I suppose.<br /><br />But for some reason I wouldn't reccomend it<br />except for those who are musically or artistically inclined.
B004XQYBA2|3.0|When you go to look for your mistakes it's confusing because mistakes are not highlighting like you think it should.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very good movie and I enjoyed it other than the language. I would give it a 3-1/2 if that were an option. In my opinion, however, both Lincoln and Les Miserables were much better and one of those movies should have been awarded the Oscar for Best Movie.
0553801473|4.0|In my review of Book Four I complained that George R.R. Martin overdid the wholesale slaughter of heroes in previous books and that this has left us with virtually no one left to root for. Well, I might have exaggerated--there are still some characters around that we might actually care about, and they appear in this book! Trouble is that most of them are all farting around in some place that's taken them out of the main plot. Oh, and there may be some spoilers ahead so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Daenarys is prominent in this book, for example, but it's hard to feel sympathy for her when she routinely makes terrible, weak decisions. FFS, girl, for a moment I mistook you for a female version of Alexander the Great, now look at you. &#34;Bloo bloo, mah peeplez!&#34; If you care about them so much then fight for them! Geeze! Anyway, Tyrion, sorely missed from the last book, returns as well, but he mostly wastes the entire book just trying to get to his destination and--there's some spoilers up ahead, here--worse yet, GRRM has made the mistake of giving him Magic Psoriasis, which will eventually turn him into a gibbering lunatic with stony skin. Great, so we can expect our favorite character to be offed at some point in the future. GRRM, you DO realize that when Tyrion dies, this saga does, too, don't you? That's not an exaggeration at all. &#34;No one is sacred&#34; does not apply to him!<br /><br />Jon Snow also returns, but suffers from the same problem of making terrible decisions. Okay, some of them were good decisions, but like his father he falls into the trap of letting his sympathies put himself and the people he cares about in too much danger. Grow a pair and--*reads to the end*--ah, nuts, too late. And then there's Theon. Ah, poor Theon. Well, that's what you get for being a dum dum. I have to wonder if GRRM is trying to make us pity the guy after all he's been through. I can't say I do, very much, even now.<br /><br />The remainder of the book is mostly side-characters again (sigh). Though, at the very least, Victarion becomes more interesting as his chapters proceed. That man is truly a bad-ass, though it's hard to admire him too much given that he is still a barbarian from the Iron Islands.<br /><br />So, it may seem like my assessment is mostly negative so far, so why then did I give this thing four stars instead of three or less? Well, because even if GRRM is falling into his old pitfalls, at least it's with characters we give a damn about, and because things REALLY picked up again near the end. For a moment there I couldn't stop turning pages. It was almost like I was reading the first book again or something! So many amazing things happened that I half-expected Khal Drogo to burst forth from the ashes of his funeral pyre, riding a dragon and playing an electric guitar. Alas, you have to trudge a bit before you get there. If you don't have the patience for that, then I can't recommend this book. For everyone else, though, I'd grab a copy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Before reading this book I saw all the negative reviews and didn't expect much.  Who are these people that are complaining?  I began the series in mid January and read straight through - I saw no decline in the quality of this series.  These are all great books!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|While this novel takes a long time to get going, and is fairly confusing at times (especially in the first third), most all of disparate pieces finally do come together at the end, and the last 50 pages are definitely a nail-biter. It's a worthwhile read, but didn't blow me away for the above-mentioned reasons. (The protagonist is fascinating, however.)
B0053YGYO4|3.0|The kind of album you could play<br />for weeks but leaves you wanting more.<br />Poppy with a melancholical sometimes<br />cheerfull alternative twinge.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I think this is a great product.  It's convenient and very easy to navigate the system to add music to your library.
B0008ENHT4|5.0|I have been waiting to see this film for a long time and I was not disappointed the only complaint is that this is one of those complicated, hard nose, gritty cop dramas that not everyone is going to get. The car chase is of course a classic the only thing is the late Steve McQueen had the balls and the know how to pull it off when watching the special features of the film. There was definitely a strong possibility to take that particular scene as classic as it is and to push even further with the techniques the crew had at the time to make the film even more true to life. All in all this is a classic film that deserves a second and third watch to appreciate it.
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|After listening to this album alot over the past 4 days, Grace for Drowning is still the better of the two for me.  The Raven does not feel as dark as Grace in overall mood, but has ups and downs.  I had pretty high expectations for this album after Grace for Drowning.  Seeing Marco Minnemann on tour and finding out that Guthrie Govan would be doing lead guitar work made the wait a little harder.<br /><br />Steven did not dissapoint. This album is stellar example of great musicianship and a great addition to my always growning PT, Steven Wilson, No Man, Blackfield, etc... collection.  The shining track on this album is definately the Title track, 'The Raven tha refused to Sing'.  This album is worth the purchase for that track alone.<br /><br />And why do I hold it at 4.5 stars, there are a few things that bugged me right off the bat.  For one, It is crowded at times.  Guthrie is such a distinct player when he gets into those blindingly fast solo sections, I felt distracted from the song.  Having hearing 'Luminol' on tour and on the 'Get all you Deserve' concert video, Guthrie's playing stuck out on the record version.  The second track 'Drive Home' also has almost a trainwreck like section from about 6:30-7 mins.  The vocals, drums and guitar solo clash for me there.  Also 'The Watchmaker' has a dueling solo section from Guthrie and the Theo Travis on Flute from about 5:40-6, there again it is a bit of a mess and detracts the listener from the song.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Guthrie Govan's playing, love his solo stuff and Aristocrats...he is a monster of a player but I just think he was a bit much for this album.  Not that there aren't some kick butt contributions to this album from him, but I felt Steven could have done some of the solos and it would have been enough.  I quite enjoyed the lead flute work from Theo Travis on GFD and was hoping for more of the same.  Sometimes I just wanted to here the space behind all the music if that makes sense...Grace breathes a little better.<br /><br />All the musicians on this album are incredible virtuosos.  The fact that they are brought together here in bringing life to Steven's songs is awesome.  Minnemann is one of the best drummers out there, Begg's Bass work on these albums is super tight, and Holzmanns Keys are beautiful soundstages.  Overall this is a great album for any Prog rock fan.<br /><br />Can't wait to see them on tour.<br /><br />PS:<br />In reading another reviewer here regarding this being a 70s dark prog rock rip off I can only partially comment: I was turned on to King Crimsons \\"In the Court...\\" album after finding out that Steven was involved in remixing/producing the catalogue. I do hear some very KC'esque melodies but I can't fault Steven or say that he is cutting and pasting.  I can only imagine that remixing KC's catalogue is a massive task and after which would have some lasting effect on his own style.  This really only makes me want to pick up more King Crimson.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2. it has such better graphics than the first temple run, plus this has new options. I love it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and I have not been disappointed in any of them.  If you want a good read that keeps you engaged this is a good choice.
B000059QYB|4.0|If you liked the 80's<br />chances are you might like<br />this album.  I myself really like<br />the 'Rock the cradle of love' video<br />wich is, sadly, not included.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Finally a book about vampires and witches for grown-ups. Although the author sometimes gets lost in her own story lines while attempting to set the stage for multiple different plot twists to come together, she had a great story about magic and history. It's a fresh spin on the supernatural that has more depth than any tween novel. I definitely look forward to reading the next two books in this trilogy.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show.  The first season is fun to watch because the characters haven't quite set into their roles yet.  For example, Sheldon doesn't begin the 3 knock thing until the middle of this season!
0470185317|5.0|me gusto el libro y recomiendo que lo compren, el vendedor fue muy amable y en todo momento se preocupo porque llegara bien.
B0086700CM|4.0|its good and fun. its not as good as the second temple run. the second has better graphics. but I still like this one just not as much as the second temple run.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book kept me engrossed from start to finish.  How many surprises can be written in one book and still keep you reading for more?  I was astounded and could not keep from thinking about the story and characters.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|If you're an Indiana Jones fan, this is for you. I did not do side-by-side comparisons, so I don't know if the new release really looks better than the old ones, but they were good quality. It was fun to watch them again!
0345803485|1.0|I remember as a young teen I had fantasies about being controlled by a powerful, handsome man.  Thank goodness I grew out of these absurdities, and how unfortunate that this book revels in them. Still, I can enjoy a fantasy book if well-written and interesting, but this book is neither.  The characters are one-dimensional, boring, and pitiful.  The writing is repetitive and childish. It was a total waste of my time to wade through this pathetic attempt at a sexual fantasy. It is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read (and I read over a hundred books every year).  Don't even bother to get it out of your local library--it's not worth your time.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Really enjoying listen to the Lumineers on my kindle while in my craft room.  I would recommend this selection to my friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very engaging book - I honestly couldn't put it down. Rarely do I have that experience with books. You also almost feel like you are there in the games.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I thought this was one of Nicholas Sparks best books. I couldn't put it down. You must read this one.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoy nonfiction and this account of the author's trek across the PCT made for a good read....definitely recommend this book
B00AFROVQC|3.0|good fun , moves so fast that it is stlightly unconvincing and way to short.<br />but very enjoyable none the less
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|As a great fan of both Tolkien and the Jackson treatment of Lord of the Rings, I awaited the release of The Hobbit with baited breath;  the result was great disappointment. I found the film moved much too slow and the Avatar style CGI was a step down from the 'realism' of the LOTR trilogy. I wish it was better!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a real Stephen King fan.  Loved his early work.  Then he got a little too weird for me.  My favorite books were the ones where he had almost two feet in the real world but just stepped out a little bit to the 'other side'.  This book had me from the beginning all the way through.  I just loved it!!!  I was around in '63 and remember the events very clearly so the subject was very familiar.  The way he mixed fact and fiction was brilliant.  Highly recommend this to anybody and everybody.
1401233384|4.0|I wouldn't say this story was very intense but it definitely was a good read... And come on, you can't not read this. This is the story that changed the dc universe. I give it a very good rating. As always, dc delivers with great artwork as well.
B008BDZP30|3.0|There's some fantastic stuff on this album, but there is also some real filler.  The instrumentals, such as the title track and 'Twenty Small Cigars', are brilliant, but much of the Flo & Eddie vocal tracks are well below par.  Additionally, some of the material sounds well below Frank's normally exceptional sound quality.  However, the last song, 'Sharleena', is a forgotten gem and helps redeem the entire package.<br />In 1970, the Mothers were temporarily abandoned and Zappa was rebuilding his career.  The addition of Drummer Ansley Dunbar was crucial, yet 'The Nancy and Mary Music' sounds more like the original band.  The instrumentals sound like a continuation of 'Hot rats', but obviously the emphasis was heading towards more vocal music, thanks to the talents of the members of the ex-Turtles.  So what you get is an album that is stitched up from instrumentals, live tracks, and new studio material with vocals.  The subject matter was turning towards more earthy topics ('Road Ladies'), but it hadn't quite come together.  There are a few classics, especially 'Transylvania Boogie', but better material from this group would soon come along.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I've read all of Flynn's book and she is definitly on my list of favorite authors. I love all the litlle twist and turns in her stories. Her own connection with her flawed heroines really helps the reader get into the real meat of the story.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book John Grisham at his best. The characters are interesting and the story keeps you wanting to read more.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|Not what I wanted in a Mahjong game.  Too busy, too little control of the objects, lead my complaints.  Looking for a relaxing few minutes, this is not it.  If there is a way to understand the scoring, not easily found by me.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|The Sleeve works so well, I would not be without it.  I even am able to put my slim stylus alongside it and zip it up.  Great addon to the Fire.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|\\"Perfume\\" (2006) was directed by tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International) and is based on the 1985 novel os the same name by Patrick Suskind. The story takes place in the 18th century and tells the magic realist story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) who was born with an extraordinary olfactory ability which led him in his quest for the perfect scent. Dustin Hoffman also stars as the perfume maker Guiseppe Baldini, whom Jean-Baptiste is an apprentice under. Jean-Baptiste is something of a social misfit who comes to realize that he has no scent of his own unlike other people. This sets him apart from others and makes him somewhat invisible, scent wise, from others. His quest for the perfect scent is something of a search for his own identity in the world. Lacking a social conscience this amoral character murders women in order to acquire their scent for his perfect perfume mix. This diabolical enterprise leads to a surprising turn of events in the later part of the movie. In a movie which feels largely realistic in the early parts it becomes pure magical fantasy towards the end with an amazing conclusion. This sumptuously filmed movie takes us through the gritty streets of Paris and into the splendid gardens of the wealthy Antonine Richis (Alan Rickman), who lives in perfume capital of the world in Grasse, France, along the French Riviera.<br /><br />The dvd has a 13 minute long feature about the making of the film with interviews with the director and cast. The dvd is of a very high quality with dark blacks and rich colours.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend told me about this wonderful show she and her husband were watching. She suggested for me to watch season 1 on line and see what I thought, well I couldn't watch it too much, and am hooked. The actors are superb, and story line is interesting to say the least. I love that you get the view of back and front of the house(staff and family).<br />I have suggested to a lot of friends and acquaintances to check it out.<br />You should start with season 1 and 2 in order to get the foundation
B003B02OOG|5.0|All the Ford County stories were really varied and yet still I testing. They are Great for a quick read
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Although it's really cool, and gives you a plethora of information, I don't think it's worth the $3.99.  The earthquake alert is in colors that you really can't see until you actually tap it and bring it up on a black background, weather alerts are not audible so consequently you do not get alerted until you open the app so I would like to see that in settings that you can change color and get the actual alert.  Otherwise, it's a wonderful app, and I would recommend it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a must have if you want a good time killer on any mobile device!!! Subway Surfers is about a character who is caught by a guard and his annoying dog. The objective is to run as long as possible before you crash.As you continue, you will accelerate faster and faster, and as you move faster, you will get more points.Such a fun game!A must have!!!!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book, as bout fate and true love has the unexpected twist all of the Sparks books have. You won't be able to put it d own until the end!
B00BLGZX5O|5.0|The tv shows that we have to put up with such as the bachelor, ANY of the housewives shows, survivor..really?? This has been a very exciting new drama show that yes is even better because of Kevin Bacon being in it.  He is an exceptional actor and i predict this series will go far.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a cool book as a humor book. I rated it a five star book . My favorite character is Greg Heffley.
1401232590|5.0|I loved that it got here quickly and was really fun to read.  Always a classic, and you can see its affect on the new batman movies.  Also, the interviews with Nolan are interesting but really short.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|An in depth view of individual characters -- good theme with realistic actions.<br />The performers did a wonderful portrayal of the character.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Just was yep... now we will do this.... and now that.... well, did like the original, at least in memory.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|[[ASIN:B008HK3XOU Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Red (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")] This case is very easy to use, making it fun to read a book,find a beginning place after taking a pause.  Highly recommend for a serious reader. I like the lighting,makes it fun to read where ever I am,relaxing, traveling or in private places:)).
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|This is the best horror movie of all time. It is scary and builds suspense and does not overdo the blood and gore like a lot father modern horror movies do. I enjoyed the extras that comes with the DVD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant game addicted and interesting love the different cities and collecting the eggs I would advise it for anyone and have also bought double coins for the game
B007TXN4TK|4.0|You get addicted to getting a better grade.  I have no musical ability, but with this fun and easy 'toy' I can pretend for a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's the grateful to the children of the world and it is very good too me and my family
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Lighthearted and relatable, this was a great book to read on vacation. Finished it in two days by the pool.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia was a great book full of information and fact that even the most Zeldaholic fan like me could learn from its great and Id recommend it to any Zelda fan :)
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book is well written but I am not a fan of love triangles. I am probably too old to be reading crap like this but is was intrigued after seeking the movie.
0756655307|5.0|This book is big, heavy and has everyone that our other Marvel Character Guide didn't have and more. This is definitely a book to have a keep. Great images, great extras... like a page on the mutant civil war, etc. Good buy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game I can never be bored because I always have the game to go to this game really is fun and I would recommend it to anyone who is just looking for something to do or wants to have fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I get so addicted to it so fast lol love how it's a world tour also fun to see different trains and scenery.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy alarm clock app to use. Simple & aesthetically pleasant to navigate. Our needs in an alarm clock app are completely satisfied... plus a few small, additional details that push this app over the top.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The case is a nice product to keep my kindle safe from harm. I like the &#34;handle feature&#34; to keep it in your hands when you are not using it on a flat surface.
B009LGO88E|5.0|The product is awesome, it fits both my 3ds ll and 3ds xl. And it not only has the extra circle pad, but also two additional left and right button(ZL ZR). Some games make use of those buttons and this makes the game more fun to play.<br /><br />And the shipment is faster than I expect. It took 5 days (actually 3 business days, it's been a weekend). I'm very satisfied with the product and the seller.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Great game! You little ones will enjoy playing this. The sounds and pictures are great. It was a game worth buying.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed reading  this so much and can't wait  to check out the movie. It was so wonderful written and I really loved it
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|We enjoyed the theater staging concept.  We haven't read the book, so we can't compare it to the novel, but it really showed the reality of the double standards applied to women in the last century.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Usually like to see movies after reading the book.  Going to skip the movie in this case.<br />Recommend this to those who value a great book no matter how macabre the subject.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Such a humbling documentary, and what a lovely man. The world needs more people like Rodriguez.<br />Thank you for sharing his story with the rest of the world
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Would recommend this. My 3 and 5 year old play with it all the time. Good buy and glad we purchased it as it can be a hit or miss with kid game apps. This one is a winner with the little ones.
B00417HV14|5.0|its the best blu-ray i have,joe is unreal,he was born+raised 30 miles from me back in new york. a very talanted man.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I always avoided this program until curiosity got the best of me about a month ago. I didn't feel like playing any games or reading, so I started browsing the vidios, etc., on my Kindle Fire. I decided to try watching the first few episodes of season 1 over the course of the next few nights. All the main characters are becoming well-fleshed-out; the writing is excellent; I love the music and the choreography, which can be absolutely hilarious one scene and, a few scenes later, be excellent. Talk about serendipity! I'm glad I decided to watch this!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself.  My favorite of the classics. .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's very similar to temple run but different in many ways as well. Good for all age groups and great for getting your brain alive.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 3 and 5 year old play with this... and I admit so do I. It's a good game to buy.... go download it!
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Best documentary I've seen in years. I couldn't stop smiling and then the tears came. A lovely and inspirational film!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! Everyone in the family loves it including me. Best game I have downloaded! You should download it right now! If you already have it play it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had seen parts of the HBO series for book one and have been following ever since. It is well written and explains the characters in great detail. I enjoyed it very much and the rest of the books in the series as well.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It wasn't really good<br />To me it kinda sucked.so if so if you wanna look up a word do it on Google
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Window into my life as a chef<br />Really compelling work, intriguing and a lesson to a chef or anyone in the business

B006LSZECO|3.0|Boring at the beginning but picks up and moves along well until the end when she leaves you just hanging at the end.
B00005JM02|5.0|My grandson loves it, it was as described, however, one of the discs does not play properly for some reason, may be my machine, although the other one does.  Still satisfied with it and the quick receipt of the items.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best ever you won't be disappointed when you get this app.<br />I play it all day until the battery dies<br />Me and my family love it and you will too
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|An excellent work of fiction and an excellent story. This film incorporates the feel of a major studio by using outstanding written  accomplishment to obtain a quality production.<br /><br />The story takes all of the good things out of a series of other sci-fi films, such as 2001, Outland and Aliens but avoids the dark and confusing linage of those that remain, such as Bladerunner and Prometheus.<br /><br />You won't have to figure anything out, but will be glad and horrified at the same time by the film's conclusion.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The premise for the story seemed so crazy &  unbelievable & yet somehow it goes along & there you are reading about being stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger for company. It's fascinating to read how Pi sees the world on his lifeboat. Sheer survival takes courage & determination way beyond what you would think a human could endure. I felt as exhausted & discouraged as him just reading about the journey. An amazing read about strength of the human mind & spirit. A really interesting twist at the end which leaves you wondering....
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|AMAZING!!!!! This book was great! One of Rick,s best books. It was so suspenseful! The best part was the ending! I think that everyone should read this. I think Rick Riordan has a lot of talent and imagination. Not many adults have a very good imagination ( sorry adults ). This book took me on an amazing ride. It was awesome! If you have read the Percy Jackson series and the other books in the heroes of Olympus series ( this series ) than you already know that Percy and Annabeth are older and a new team of heroes have come. It is so weird how if you have already read the Percy Jackson series and than you read this series your most likely going to say, \\" OMG! Percy is in this book?\\" or \\" Percy and Annabeth are back!\\" or \\"How old are they?\\"  Those are kind of what I was thinking, but I am a MARSHMALLOW, so they might not be what you were thinking. Anyway, THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!!!!! I AM SUPER MARSHMALLOW!!!!!!-
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Sound quality was not so good, besides I found the story moving very slow. Also, it seemed to glamorize crime but understand that the writer had limited flexibility as this was based on true story
B005T87QCI|5.0|It's the best game ever but it has you buy the build your own robot still it's the best game ever.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|The series is fantastic, however disc 2 doesn't work. I would like another set sent out please at your cost. How do we progress sith this request?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a well made game  and a wonderful follow up to the first temple run. I love playing within the new graphics of the game.

B004YOEFG8|5.0|The type of 3d movie I have been searching for after about 15+ purchases.  A beautiful showcase of what can be done with 3d films.  Only review I have ever written. Buy this! I can only imagine how amazing this would be on the big screen at an iMax!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Better then temple run by a long shot i would pick it over most games any day best game ever
B0060MYM7O|5.0|A lot of little things were different from the Book (as well as a few bigger plot lines) but as a stand alone show it was very well done and great acting.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I love, love, LOVE this album! Foster the People's music is so good to jam to no matter what you're doing. &#60;3
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book had more words that anybody could possibly use in their entire life. Some words I wish I could pronounce but I can't.I'll probably use this  dictionary to look up words all the time. I would probably have to mention this  book to my friends There names are Molly,Alexis,Maddi,Calvin,Caleb,and Justin. They would probably use this information all the time to. Any words that you need to look up you just have to type the word you want,and it just pops up.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|has come in handy for me when i needed it most and couldn't find my flash light in an emergency.
0486475824|5.0|It was a great book, and it came on time.  I needed it for a class, and I got it earlier enough to be used.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|For me, this is as good as the Black Keys get. This is when they'd mastered their early, rough, old sounding blues rock. Everything since seems to be a little short on soul.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie; it was a great example of non-fiction storytelling. Brad Pitt was an excellent choice for the lead role; he seemed very comfortable in this character.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was a very easy book to read some of the words I couldn't pronounce but most of them I could pronounce. It had  more words then I would probably use. I would probably have to mention this book to my friends.
B008M87GJK|5.0|The thing you can always get from BBC is that they cover everything.  BBC reports issues of interest for all and keeps in on spot.  I get all my information of world events from BBC which I don't get from the American News.
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|This is one of Hitchcock's best films--funny, romantic, poignant, and political--an absolute classic!  Perfect performances by Donat and Carroll, and a brilliant supporting cast.  A candidate for anyone's top-ten list.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|If you like old Black keys, you'll love this. Doesn't have the electronic elements of newer albums like Brother and El Camino. For me, this part of their sound peaked with the Rubber Factory, but had been getting better since their debut. So I'd put this just below that high watermark.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Lots of twists and turns. Awesome!!!<br />A lot of things I didn't expect. Can't wait to watch this season's episodes.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series left me hungry for more. One of the best reads of all time. Ladies get your man involved while you read this. It will be rewarding.
B009JZY3B4|4.0|Very good movie - lots of action. Any Star Trek fan will absolutely enjoy watching this movie. Can't wait for the next one.
0920236162|5.0|Robert Munsch is always fun to read. The combination of art work and story are a joy for my three year old granddaughter. Even after the repeated readings, she laughs at the story line.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|In my opinion, the band peaked with Rubber Factory, when they found the perfect line between rough blues rock and just enough polish. Don't get me wrong, the new stuff is still very good, but they're leaning toward the elector synthetic stuff too much for my liking. If you heard lonely boy and liked it, this album is more of the same.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|The game was challenging and loads of fun.  The graphics were great. I  was very disappointed to have to BUY the complete game in order to finish. I wish the game was marked SAMPLE ONLY. I would not have downloaded this game. This was time I will not recover.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this all the time it's very addictive oh and btw I love the update is awesome running in Rome lol
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This a great hidden object game with some good twists and a bit of fright but not too scary. Enjoyable and worth every penny.
1423101499|5.0|My granddaughter has already finished the first four books in the Percy Jackson series. She can't wait to read each book. Then she regales all of us with the plot lines of each book. She has even convinced her mother and father to read the books. And they are enjoyed by all.
B009GQ57ES|3.0|Definitely has some good stuff on it, but Macklemore gets better the less serious that he is. Thrift Shop is easily the high point. Some of the other material does kind of sound like watered down Eminem.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great game! Just started playing and I can't stop. Very entertaining and I highly recommend that you play it now.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book happens to be SF, but it is excellent reading beyond any categorization into genre. Weir understands pace, and engages the reader without pause. I recommend _The Martian_ without hesitation or reservation.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have really ensued ever episode and feel like I know them personally. It is a great show-the cast is superb
B00AFEXRME|5.0|It was a reminder of where God bought me from. This is a great movie to let one see that everyday is a gift and that we should count our blessings and be thankful and to be good stewarts of what God has given us, our lives.<br />Yes I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really engaging and neat game.  I like that they are changing the different places the characters are in.
B00AW28HF6|4.0|The first few words - 'Etched sidewinder snake tracks ...' painted a vivid desert scene, drawing me into the story. An espionage thriller, it's full of spies, secret agents and their conflicting agendas. The plot criss-crossed the globe, but at the start of each chapter it is defined where and when the action is taking place. Warning: Adults only - Contains explicit sexual content. A lot of information is imparted (reminded me of Tom Clancy). Massive potential for this story to be made into an action-packed movie. In my mind I casted Angela Jolie/ Scarlet Johanson as Kefira and Colin Farrell as Zak. The story ended with a satisfying teaser for the next installment. This book was gifted to me by the author for an honest review and the opinions expressed here are my own.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|The reincarnation of Janis Joplin or perhaps the child of Janis and Otis Redding.  This is just a great soul/blues album.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book starts out fairly slow with a lot of description.  At first I found it a bit difficult to follow, but then I was able to figure it out and read the book easily.  The rest of the book keeps you intrigued and wanting to read and think.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One of the best shows to EVER grace your t.v! I promise you it will be money well spent if and when you purchase this product!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but I do feel like some of the episodes are really slow. That's my only complaint tho!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|My first time using Instant Video and it was effortless on my computer. Just press play and pause when ever you need to...
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|I ahve always been a lover of this gender, Lost Girl has action, suspense y some sex scenes (not the type of tv show you want your kids to watch)  all combined in a great, adult oriented story. The cast is great and the argument smart.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best games I ever played. It's better than temple run  2 it's better than any game u can think of.
B00BHMEALA|1.0|It's disgraceful that this film is being advertised as based on true events.  The reality is that in order to make the Americans more heroic the British have been demonised and the Canadians sidelined. The British did help the Americans at considerable risk to themselves.  I'm not surprised the truth was discarded because American film makers seem to love claiming the credit for other people's achievements.  If I were an American,  I'd be embarrassed by this film.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|i haven't figured out anything to do with this thing.  I am uncertain what the the purpose is.  There is absolutely no way I'd recommend it to anyone.
B007Q53IQ0|4.0|One of the best examples of what Spain cinematography has to offer, it is especially surprising to see how good singer is Penelope Cruz. Bravo
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game! Easy to play and doesn't get boring. The graphics are good and the mini games are fun, too. There is a lot of paid content though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Teaches you a lot too. I'm pretty happy with this app so far but really I'm just waiting it for the gemssssss I need em. :3
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game its so addictive......you sit there and breed dragons and you buy islands for your dragons to live on.I have 80 dragons so far because it is such a fun game!!! Definitely reccomended to anyone adults too-my mom loves this game!Get it now!
B004SKJTY6|1.0|Hated this. There's nothing about the story here.  This is only for someone who has read the book and seen the movie and just love both so much they plan to immerse themselves in the idiots responsible for both.  i can't enjoy watching a bunch of Hollywood types patting themselves on the back for what they perceive to be a great success; especially when I don't think it was a success..
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A powerful movie that has its light and entertaining moments that will keep your on the edge of your seat!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint with this invigorating love/suspenseful story. I couldn't put it down and left me wanting more when it was over.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I learned more about myself in 100 pages than I ever could have imagined. Do yourself and your spouse a huge favor and read it.
B008J05EL8|5.0|I really enjoy features this application gives me. It gives me hands on capabilities that I never had with similar apps.
146500632X|5.0|My niece is obsessed with one direction. She really loved this as an extra Christmas gift! I ighly recommend it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was my first read by Kate Morton and it was incredible! I am looking forward to reading the rest of her books. This is a book to be savored, not rushed through.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Great way to waste time, along the same lines as Bejewelled, Angry Birds, etc.  Not bad for 99 cents...got 4 stars for lagging screens at times.
0321898648|5.0|I already bought the DVD and got a simple disk.  So i thought the book would full file me, and it is a much finer edition.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though the outcome is known I was on the edge of my seat through most of the movie. Loved it!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A little slow in the beginning, but by 40% through it got very interesting. Hard to put down. I would recommend it to my girlfriends for sure.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Usually I prefer to read the novel before seeing the movie.  In this case, we saw the movie last summer, and the family was debating the ending.  The novel actually cleared things up for me.  I enjoyed his writing, and I believe you will enjoy this book even if you haev seen the movie already!  I followed this with Mystic River, which I also loved, and will now rent that movie.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|This simple book is quite profound. Steinbeck is quite brilliant. I found myself laughing out loud and then in reflection at various points in the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The controls are simple, the graphics are basic and bright, the missions are a great mix of difficulty but all very obtainable. There is no need to buy things with real money. You will want to play again and again. My battery hates me for playing this game. The game has changed twice since I downloaded it with different graphics, yes the sections seem to be the same but it makes it seem like a new game. Could possibly do with a few different player selectable soundtracks to change it up a bit more. GET IT!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A must read definitely glad a friend told me about this book. Even better I downloaded it for half the price at stores around here<br />And carry it on all my mobile devices which makes it easier to read because I have it with me at all times. The book itself draws you in from the first ten pages and gets better as it goes on. I couldn't put it down
B007KOYEOC|2.0|It`s easy to read but boring. I read the first book in one week, the second in one month, the third in three months.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like the story line but I wish there was more romance.  I wanted to be more at the end. It just left me hanging.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this because it was very entertaining and I couldn't put it down for a minute. Exceptional tale. Well written
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show gives a thoughtful perspective on a romanticized way of life.  It is beautifully made and well-acted.  Pure enjoyment.
1582701709|5.0|This book literally changed my life. It was recommended to me by a professional therapist and I am beyond grateful for having opened my eyes to The Secret! The movie The Secret was also very helpful to me in deciphering the idea as I was so far pointed the other way it was a difficult concept for me to grasp at the beginning. Rhonda's second book, The Power, is even better and more inspiring if you can believe that.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This is Rammstein as I will always remember them, clean cut and young and not all weirded out like they have been lately.<br /><br />Only thing disappointing is the lack of the Buck Dich song on the disk which would have been entertaining, as I believe it was part of the same show.
B0055N0FZM|5.0|What an amazing book. Gives you a feeling of being present and the world should stop but It keeps moving.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Ok. Not the most exciting movie I've seen, but I guess it did the job. Perhaps not worth the 3.99 for 24 hrs though.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The quality is not the greatest, but it does the work is supposed to do, for the price i won't complain.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Thanks for something priceless.  Thanks for the package.  It didn't take that long.  I'm not fond of having to write more.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you like love stories; you will like this book.  I don't usually read love stories; but thought I'd read something different and I could not put it down.<br />I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone that want's to read a good love story.  It also has a bit of suspense in it as well.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This was an excellent season with the whole cast put on a stellar show. episodes Hermanos, Salud, Crawl Space and Face Off are the best. This show seems to be getting only better as the seasons roll on.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was good. I can't wait for the next one. I hope they make more after that. I hope it doesn't take too long.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat. With the secrets everyone has and Jason's lost memory. 100% recomended.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I did choose this book because off my interest in the challenges the marines face.<br />The commitment Adam achieved trough his faith and trust in his Maker is most inspiring.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone facing challenges and needs direction to overcome and step out as a conqerer.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I was stupid for getting this game.  I suck at drawing and lack imagination.  Wound up uninstalling from my tablet.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|What can I say. This is another great chillin album. Got a lottle rasta flare mixed with hip hop.. Ba Da Bah Bah Bah.  I'm lovin it..
B008L40Q7E|4.0|I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Ian Fleming's books. They are so much better than the films. I LOVED IT.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|angeline plays a great female action heroine this movie. hopefully they can make more of these. great visuals, quality of the movie, and overall a good action flick.
B0052TDGQO|1.0|I loved listening to him sing on American Idol but I really hate this CD.  It is was too country for my taste.  :-(
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Love her....Great voice , lyrics. music.<br />I have all of her music. Can't wait for her next album.<br />It's great.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|The customer service was very great at sending back correspondence i.e. emails. I understood the dvd would get to my place from London. The product is exactly what I wanted!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|It's easy and fun! Just like playing on paper! I would recommend this app to any one who likes sudoku.
0316228532|1.0|Read the first 103 pages. Boring. Boring. Boring. Did not read the last 400 pages. I'm sure they are just as boring.
1451695195|5.0|knowing he was a skeptic before his incident  and details he provides proves his experience was no doubt real , i beleive this definately worth a buy highly recommend
B00AL3OD7C|5.0|This version is quite different sounding to my ears, and I found it very distinct and sort of polished compared to the 1997 Remaster or the original, even.  It's sort of like the 2112 for these Post-Modern Era Times.  I'd give it a spin if you're into the other versions.  I can't wait to get the 5.1 Surround Mix as well.  Rock On!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Although this non-fiction account of the traits and tribulations of introverts is laced with references to scholarly studies, it's an accessible read for laypeople. Cain takes us along on junkets to such locations as an &#34;extrovert&#34; workshop and Harvard's Business School to show how introverts cope with societal pressure.
B00ATP24SW|4.0|Nemesis the new Album from Finland's Stratovarius. When i first heard this album i had mixed feeling about it. it's pretty much what you come to expect from Stratovarius. Great Musicianship, Great Melodies, And really big Choruses. This album is pretty solid but it doesn't really live up to the previous album Elysium. Which i thought was a Masterpiece, And my pick for best Metal Album of 2011. Their are some very good songs on this album including a couple of slammin ballads like Castles in the Air, And If the Story Is over. But overall their isn't a lot of replay value on this album, And it seems a little contrived. Nemesis is still a very good album and the songs are all there and they are very consistant. so i would reccomend the album based on that alone.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great story line and film making. Watching the actors grow up on screen was fun too! The special effects got better with each movie as well. My only complaint was for The Deathly Hallows, Part 1, It could have been cut by twenty minutes easily! Great series overall though!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|brings me back to the mario days! i love this series of leps world. I have played both on the fire and they work great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although I think the series is for the younger readers.  Collins does give her characters life and is very easy to read.
B000244FDW|5.0|I was entranced by this version when I first saw it on TV and watched each episode 3 or 4 times as it was scheduled on my PBS station.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|The main characters in this novel are very likeable. I felt Sparks rehatched everything too many times. I did a lot of speed reading on pages that I felt were copies of previous pages. Kevin, not likeable, drank way too much and lived to repeat his thoughts over and over. The descriptions of his drinking bouts made me wonder how he lived to tell any of it. His driving his car day and night and hundreds of miles after many bottles of vodka was a tad far fetched.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is sooo awesome! I love it! If I were you, I would definately get this app! You'll love it! :D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it's the best game I've ever played and its free! I'm only 10 and subway surfers is my favorite game! Even if your only 3! My family members love it too! It's a awesome free game for people from 5 to 55!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I liked the characters in this movie and the play between the various characters.  Very realistic characters and situations, too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was kept in the book until the end. I am still shaking my head over the fantastically impossible ending. The author certainly presented many twists and turns, and the unexpected happen. This book is well written, easy to read and very enjoyable.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Middling action flick with a post-apocalyptic-world overlay, it has nothing to contribute to a genre that been done much better before. I rented it because I like Karl Urban and Lena Headey (great performance btw, she's totally believable). There were some cool special effects, which I liked, but unfortunately couldn't offset the boredom creeping over me as I kept checking the time. Hardcore Dredd fans may find more to appreciate than I did.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I real enjoyed the complete First Series , cann't wait to view the rest of the series !!!<br />Well done
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is the best Christmas movie since National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Family friendly and never gets old. Will Ferrell at his finest.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the fresh premise. I thought it was nicely done and would recommend it to friends. It was a little predictable.
0062238868|5.0|An outstanding read with the saddest of endings.  I read this after hearing of Chris' passing and the story gave me a renewed respect for people like Chris whose commitment, honor and skills allow so many of us to take our freedom and protection for granted.
1401937268|5.0|They are beautiful, well written, and fun to work with. I highly recommend getting these for yourself or daily readings.
B000FC130E|5.0|While Gaiman has been around &#34;forever&#34; and is highly established as a brilliant writer, this is the only thing of his I've ever read...and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny and clever, it's a book all writers should read, and I can't think why anyone would dislike it.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This was an amazing book and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It was an exceptionally thrilling book and I couldn't stop reading it till I got to the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game SO much fun.... I love that it updates with New places<br />placement grandsons and I take turns playing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an amazing end to this trilogy of great books! Let's never forget that our children are our only future and that we need to cherish and protect them first and foremost!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love this soundtrack and have been known to keep it looping endlessly for days in my car so I can sing along on my commutes. Sultry, sexy, and makes you want to shimmy around on a stage on your own.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Amazingly. He is so talented. Many people told me to get it but I took a ehile. Wish I hadnt. Its my favlrite album at the moment. All the songs are great. Just wish there was more of them.
B004EF65QA|5.0|This is not the movie about the Civil War that I thought it would be. IT WAS MUCH BETTER! This movie takes place in England in the mid 1800's. Original book of the same name and written by Elizabeth Gaskell is akin to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The movie is informative of the living conditions in cotton mill cities of that period and very romantic as well. This is A MUST SEE for all BBC mini-series and PBS Masterpiece lovers! I would highly recommend this version for anyone wanting to add to their video library as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this story.  The subject matter was difficult.  It left me in tears both times I read it.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|The acting is very decent, the take on a classic is very clever, and there are some definite laugh out loud moments. A great rom-com
B000065U1N|5.0|A very good detailed story of the events in Somalia, taken from the soldiers perspective. Despite being an historical account of the events, it makes for a great movie.  it is good to see the human side of the soldiers as well as the action.  truly one of my favorite movies out there
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August Pullman is a determined 5th grader with facial deformities who goes to school for the first time and faces makes many friends and faces many problems,:@Jackson me
B00BHMF578|3.0|Interesting movie, however, not the Best Picture of the Year.  Movie is basically about the one time Hollywodd did something unselfish, so of course, they give themselves an award.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and I play it every day. trust me.this game is awesome and is worth the price.
080214473X|5.0|A very good detailed story of the events in Somalia, taken from the soldiers perspective. Despite being an historical account of the events, it reads like a novel. It is good also to read some real stories to put into perspectives the fictions on this subject.
B00000AFDW|3.0|I was a big KIss fan back in the 70s when I was kid, and was excited when the original four got back to together.  I bought this when it was first released, listened to it a few times and them let it collect dust because I really did not think much of it.<br />Recently I have been listening to the old albums including this one, reading more about Kiss, and watching some concert videos so I revisited this one. It is better than I remember.<br />In songwriting terms, Gene in particular really brought his A game (I always thought Gene was the least talented member).  Three of Gene's four songs are excellent, probably the best he has written in a long time.  It is interesting that he did not write about sex, guess settling down has changed him.<br />The big cop-out about Psycho Circus is that Ace and Peter didn't play or really sing much on the album.  This is mainly the Gene and Paul show with Tommy Thayer, a session drummer, and some other musicians (all this according to info at kissfaq.com).  I know at this point, Ace and Peter were basically contracted to be part of the reunion - Gene had $ signs in his eyes at the 1995 Unplugged show - but still Ace and Peter should have played more on this album.  Here is a breakdown of the songs.<br /><br />1.  Psycho Circus - a Paul song and the best track on the album.  Great opener.  A song Kiss should have written back in the 70s.  Really works for the stage show.<br /><br />2.  Within - the first of Gene's great songs.  I guess it was written years prior to the reunion.  Very grunge, reminds me a bit of Godsmack.  Terrific song.  Great vocals by Gene.<br /><br />3.  I Pledge Allegiance to the State of R'n R - a Paul anthem.  Not one of his best songs.  Sounds very 80s.  God Gave R'n R to You was a better song.<br /><br />4.  Into the Void - the only Ace song and only one where all four guys actually play on it.  Not sure why because Peter shows he still has the drumming chops.  Ace mixed this himself rather let the producermix it.  As a result it sounds more raw and packs a punch.  Great tune, sounds like older Kiss circa Rock 'n Roll Over.<br /><br />5.  We Are One - Gene shows off his love of the Beatles.  Terrific mid tempo songm very mature and introspective lyrics.  Would have been better if Peter and Paul sang the prominent backing vocals (all Gene).  The hand claps are a little hokey.  Could have been a hit single in another era.<br /><br />6.  You Wanted the Best - a dud, the album makes a loud clunk with this song.  More of a marketing ploy then a real song.  Only time all four original guys sing together, but it seems forced.  Paul, Gene, Peter and Ace have different vocal styles and voices so they don't really bend well together.  One of the worst songs in the Kiss catalog.  I guess Gene and Paul felt that had to make the reunion look legit with this song.  Stupid, self-serving lyrics too.<br /><br />7.  Raise Your Glasses - the other really good Paul song.  Great anthem with a catchy chorus.  A few years ago I heard a group of Veterans sings this at a special concert.<br /><br />8.  I Finally Found my Way - Peter's only lead vocal, but the song was written by Paul and Bob Ezrin.  I like Peter's voice, but this is not a good ballad.  Really nothing special and it is saddled with Ezrin's overly sappy arrangement.  They should have let Peter sing a rocker instead.  Another clunker.<br /><br />9.  Dreamin' -  the last Paul song.  I can understand the comparisons to Eighteen by Alice Cooper.  Decent song, but I don't like it as much as Raise Your Glasses or the title track.<br /><br />10.  Journey of 1000 Years - Another great Gene track.  Doesn't really sound like Kiss.  A string section repeats the melody line from Psycho Circus. Great military-style drumming from the session drummer.  Excellent way to end the album.<br /><br />If you find a cheap used copy of this, I would pick it up.  It is very good even though Ace and Peter don't play much on it.  I give it three stars because it could have been better had Peter and Ace been allowed to participate in the sessions.  It was produced by Bruce Farbairn who worked with Aerosmith on few albums.  Some of the songs are a bit too polished-sounding for my tastes.  Others needed to sound polished.<br />Still give it a chance.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is literally the funniest thing since... since... since.. since ever! If you haven't watched it watch it now!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I finally got the correct version of the series on the third try. The first two would not work in my DVD player. I also had a very difficult time getting refunds for the two I returned. If a DVD doers not work in American DVD players ( It apparently was for European consumption ) why sell it in America?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game for kids and adults me and my kids love it YOU will love it and I'm pikey about games
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. I can finally be creative and customize my pictures. even if you don't have a twitter,  facebook,  ext.,  it is still fun to use.
B000683VI4|2.0|This is a GREAT movie but it seems like I got a defective copy because towards the end of the movie, the soundtrack is not in sync with the movie -- you see them speaking, but then you have to wait a few seconds for the sound to kick in.  VERY annoying.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Love this movie. The settings & effects are great, the soundtrack is pretty cool, and the actors do a good job carrying the story. For any fan of sci-fi this is a must see.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book even though it is geared toward younger readers. It is definitely worth taking time out of a busy life for a little fun and fantasy.
B0000C9ZBW|3.0|This is an attractively designed watch, keeps good time.  Have had no problem with pain twear. The clasp (check the photos carefully) seems flimsy and is different than the spec diagram; some may find this mechanism frustrating to adjust and clumsy to fasten on a daily basis. I know I do.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Lol you probably reading this because of the title but this is the best game in the world or... the second best game in the world minecraft is the 1st

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Nice fun game to pass the time away.  Not too hard with the time limits.  Worth playing if you like match three games
B004GCK6XY|5.0|Great romantic comedy. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts at their best. I think Julia Roberts' charator was based on her.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My cable arrived 2 days earlier than I expected and now I have my Kindle fired-up and I am happily reading again!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Profoundly beautiful. One we of those books that are unforgettable.  I will read the book again and will highly recommend it.
B008220C56|4.0|If you are looking for a pure &#34;stick to the book' adaptation of the novel, look elsewhere. This is a highly stylized, reimagined retelling more akin to a ballet or opera than to a cinematic adaptation to the classic novel. And I'll be honest - I am glad it was. If I want the book, I'll read the book. If I want a classic 'by the numbers' adaptation there are other versions out there.<br /><br />This is a visual masterpiece with moments of incredible beauty and cinematic wonder. The transitions between scenes, often done in one long take, are breathtaking (and one of the bonus features on the disc, a time-lapse look at how the stage set was created and re-created for each scene is awe inspiring).<br /><br />Is Tom Stoppard's adaptation 100% successful? No. The beginning is muddy. The relationships between characters is oftentimes not explained (I had to go online to check out a synopsis during the film to figure out who the heck Kitty was in relation to everyone else). There is a great deal of shorthand with visuals and movement telling the story rather than text (so one's enjoyment of this film will greatly depend on one's acceptance of the use of those elements to tell a story). But there is a lot to love in his adaptation, which is a highly condensed and filtered version of the book (admit it, detractors...to get everything you wanted into this film, it would have to be 5-6 hours long). The costumes deserved their Oscar (and the short featurette on them is well worth seeing). The score is beautiful. The performances are overall very good (although it takes a while to process Jude Law being the non-desirable one in any relationship...)<br /><br />As I said, this is more akin to a ballet or opera and as such foreknowledge greatly enhances the experience. But it is a movie one has to watch and absorb versus listening to, and one I plan on re-watching multiple times.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I liked the free app,but needed the option to set more alarms, so I upgraded to the paid app.  This is the best clock/alarm clock that I have found.  I love it.  As a previou reviewer alluded to, other developers shoul take notes.
B0052REQLK|5.0|This is recommended reading for my kids, I hope they have the ears and maturity to hear the lessons before they make easily avoidable errors.<br /><br />We are too soon old and too late smart.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I was skeptical about Halo from the get go, to top it off to many people were ranting and raving and ruining it for me. Years later after it came out...now I'm falling in love on my own terms. I've fallen pretty hard for this series of games and all the media that goes with it
1616550414|5.0|My husband has been playing Zelda his entire life and wanted this for his birthday! It is of great quality--hardcover and very heavy! Awesome information and art in it too!
B000I9UA8U|5.0|I love this film. Humor is very British(dry) and extremely funny. Well written story and you really feel connected to the actors based on their wonderful performances
0374275637|5.0|This book provides great insights on how people make decisions, how it comes they often make bad decisions (all types of errors made). It also offers key ways on how to avoid these, eg through framing the decision at hand differently. It has been helpful to me in explaining how I got to different views than my colleagues, and then creating a common view to build the decision on. It is a good idea to combine reading this book with the work of David Rock, who offers additional insights and understanding.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Still Good-early concepts close to virtual reality which was still being developed at the time. Unreal vistas emerge in unique chromes and hues.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This game is very well done. I'm new to Sudoku, but I can tell this game is real quality. It's very easy to get started and has many features to allow for easy to much harder puzzles.
B00BHU261S|3.0|All of the actors performances good. Couldn't hold my attention though. Dragged in some parts. More of a love story than a story about the making of Psyco.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I had never heard of Lana Del Ray before purchasing this album, and I was skeptical how much I'd like it. After having purchased it, though, I can't stop listening! From Blue Jeans to the Title song, Born to Die, I love them all! It's rare that there is an album with so many great songs. I highly recommend her for anyone who likes Regina Spektor, Florence + the Machine, Fleet Foxes, or Sia (amongst others). Great album by a great artist!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good on my kindle fire hd though coins don't spin like on my ipad but is still great for kids and is like temple run but easier
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched the whole series on my flight from Munich to Toronto. I watched season 2 from Seattle to Frankfurt. Thanks.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The theme of marital violence is oft-repeated, nothing new there, so the basic premise of the book lacked novelty. The hero and heroine were so ordinary that you feel very disappointed. Its like going to a fine dining restaurant for a great dining experience and getting home cooked ordinary fare - nothing great, nothing to rave about, not an enjoyable reading experience. The language was plebian - no sparks of humour, no descriptive narrative - almost like a paperback romance  and you think you have outgrown that long time ago. Quite disappointed !
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Had my device malfunction and couldn't get back my game. Invested A lott of time,  collected coins upgrades, and unlocked characters. Couldn't get my content back even by singing into Facebook. WASTE OF TIME!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is SO easy to use! I love it that I can switch back and forth among several translations on a given verse. I wish I could download it to my device (as opposed to always having it in the &#34;cloud.&#34;) as I'm not always able to access wi-fi.<br /><br />mag
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Action is great. Back story scenes keep it exciting. Great show to watch. Seems like some characters are still developing so can't wait for more episodes.
B004P64H7M|5.0|I try to read every Balducci book written. It's often difficult to find what I want in large print so I have several authors I choose from. Hells Corner was exciting with a lot of twists and turns to keep you guessing. I loved it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|What a great book! The end is very unexpected but ties everything together. This is overall a great series to read!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is app is the best app every you have to get it. It is so fun I can't put it down! :+) so awesom
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so funny and fun um the thing I dont like is you have you get a lot of boxes to try stuff
0060989157|5.0|This book is very honest and no holds bared! Even if your not a fan of this band or even know who they are, it's one hell of a roller coaster of excess and the ups and downs of having fame.
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|If you are a fan of Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty or George Harrison, then you have to get this album. It is one of his best albums ever.
1449410243|4.0|Bought two copies for this as Christmas gifts. The recipients enjoyed it's off the wall humor and it had its wonderful moments. Good for people who like off the wall humor, though not something I'd buy for myself.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so fun... I think it's easier to go farther on temple run 2, ANYONE ELSE WITH ME?????<br />The only problem is (it's my fault but I don't know what to do about it) I let my friend play this game and she spent everything I had... I am now faster at running which I don't like at all. My highest run is 13,088 so I can't decide if I should restart the game or not...<br /><br />YES BUTTON= I should restart the game<br />NO BUTTON= I shouldn't restart the game.  All I need is one answer honestly
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I read that the actor felt his part was stagnant, and wanted to leave. Couldn't Julian Fellows have upped his character?  Oh, well!

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is brilliant at exploiting the common place, the mundane. She takes something like marriage, which has the potential to be a lifetime of happiness or go exceptionally wrong; and magnifies the nuances. Gone Girl made me question my own marriage for a hot minute. I accidentally put it under Gillian's microscope... Gone Girl made me uncomfortable, and I liked it. I have a hard time finding books that I truly get invested in. Didn't have that problem here. I read it on vacation and I couldn't put it down.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|The music is captivating, inspiring and lovely.  I play it often as I work as it sets a mode for me to be very productive.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I read the good reviews on here and decided to give this movie a whirl. Bottom line? It was incredibly solid and well worth it! If you like 80's action flicks, or just action movies in general, you will be heartily entertained. There isn't much of a story here, but that's not what it's supposed to be. It's packed with great action scenes and it does what it's supposed to do. I was entertained the entire length of the film. BTW even though you only see half his face the entire movie, Karl Urban has the best frown/angry face ever.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This a beautiful amazing book! The writing is sincere and heartfelt,the author is deep and introspective. I truly loved it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The last thing women need in this world is to believe it is ok to submit to a controlling jerk. My book club picked it and I couldn't finish it. NO!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've experienced a few of the unusual or \\"unexplained\\" events in this book too.  So glad Eban wrote Proof of Heaven.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read it in 3 days. But it was worth it. I read it twice and it was better the second time because I took a closer look at the words and understood everything.
B005KR6NS6|4.0|I learned to Tango, and/or I fell in love?<br /><br />This is a good movie about the process of learning tango...committment (cannot learn it in six lessons), a period of obsession must exist for a while( do not worry, obsession should pass), the need for abandonment of your ego at the door, the beauty of the dance and exhilaration when you are able to perform the moves successfully.<br /><br />Falling in love? More complicated than tango, especially when it involves an egomaniac, or two.<br /><br />What made it a nice movie...it supported every would-be tanguero's dream of the ability to take lessons anywhere (Buenos Aires, Paris,) and intensively, and yes,  to even fall in love, if that is what it takes to learn tango.<br /><br /> Learn Tango, ¡feel good forever!  Fall in love? maybe not so much.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's entertaining. It definitely killed some time when I had nothing else to do. It's also fun for the kids.
B0033807C2|5.0|This was a sick book<br />Really adventurous and a sad story.<br />He describes the battle really well!<br />Rick riordan is an excellent writer
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a totally amazing addictive game it's hard to put it down once you start playing. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved this-an hilarious uplifting romantic page turner & which in passing engages a difficult, ambitious subject- creatively.<br />Its poignant; Assoc Professor Don makes this book-he is given no clear diagnostic label (maybe-part of the point?) but like a PG version of \\"50 Shades\\" the romance hinges on his struggles- with physical intimacy.<br />\\" `Look at me when I'm talking'<br />`I kept looking out the window. I was already overstimulated. `I know what you look like.' \\"<br />`Do you find me attractive?'....<br />`I haven't really noticed', I told the most beautiful woman in the world.' \\"<br /><br />& he can't do emotional confrontation either;<br /><br />\\" ' no way. No f**ing way. You did, didn't you? What's worse. You'd rather make a fool of yourself in front of everyone than tell her she didn't float your boat' \\"<br />But he doesn't struggle really-he conquers quickly. He has no friends - but just as soon as he tries - he does<br /><br />Don's complex character is very insightfully delivered - he's a Clayton's lighthearted Aspie- imaginatively delivered. Don challenges our stereotype of \\"dag\\". We get to see the up-side. He's academically smart but like everyone- can't see himself clearly- he's sure he's depressed-yet he squeezes as very much into every single day as he ingeniously can. He thrives on diversity and risk but has learnt to avoid it. Emotional intensity is danger and there is vague reference to a formative painful event in the past.  He loves problems - he's competitive. He sees nothing of life's grey- his world is strewn with false assumptions but yet he has the advantage thru force of will & his v special abilities to objectively reason-to achieve insight where others with their own false but different assumptions might fail.<br />He's principled, responsible, caring, constant -but because he can't access any of `the arts' he decides he is without empathy. Actually he has empathy in spades - he just catastrophizes at raw emotional intensity.<br /><br />Love arrives and tempts him to chance risk, fix himself and the world too. It looks like his undoing as unfettered emotion and narrow focus cause loss of rational perspective. He's understated sexy-a bumbling mild mannered Clark Kent.<br /><br />The story champions tolerance. It champions people as a smorgasbord of `difference'; Nerds-Empaths; none seen as more potentially dysfunctional than the other. Rosie & Gene, Claudia- all our expert psychologists- they have major problems too. They don't see themselves, Don or the world any more clearly- for all their training- nor have fewer problems. Simsion shows it's really a fine line for all of us? Empaths' have their issues too.<br />We see why `Aspies' don't drink at Watson's bar in Lygon st after midnight- its so they can do all those important, tedious,life saving jobs where mistakes are not tolerated.<br />The story presents life's conundrums to Don- those times when empathy & logic rub uncomfortably up against each other. Should you empathize & give doubtful help to people who might benefit- even though it places them & you at risk ? Or go 'Aspie' and deny them the help because that's safer & smarter.<br />I will enjoy the movie- & explaining to my kids why Don needs to ride a skeleton- hope it stays Aussie.<br />Don's comment for p. 258\\"'Geoffrey Case. Not a great return on his tuition fees'\\"<br />A 30 yr reunion? HECS came in later-no tuition fees for Geoffrey says Don.
B0063M22QO|5.0|HAVE always enjoyed playing marching so when I got my Kindle fire I went looking for an app. I am very pleased with this app. The colours are bright and clear making it easy to distinguish the tiles. I would  highly recommend this app .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is by far the best love story I have read in a long time. It gets you hooked  and makes you want to keep reading to see what happens next. Highly recommended!!!!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app works just like it says it will.  Calibration takes about an hour, but once it's done, you get a very detailed account of battery life for different activities.  Interface is user friendly and well laid out.  This app is worth more than the price tag.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Every song is good.  Thank you, Bruno Mars for another great album at such a great price.  Keep 'em coming.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|We watched this on Amazon and loved it so much that we just went ahead and subscribed to HBO for the next season.  We got a deal so it made more sense.  You will get hooked!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Was printing out Sudoku puzzles to do, but this is so much better. Love the way it highlights a single number in play including the pencil notes of that number! &amp; the highlight changes color if you're in pencil-note-mode or fill-in-the-blank-mode. You'll see :) If I make a mistake I can find out where I messed up. I like how you can customize it too.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|This album was absolutely amazing! The boys put so much into it and they're growing up so the music grows up with them so it's awesome to watch them grow up even with the music!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I was thoroughly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. After reading and hearing such mixed reviews, I decided to rent it anyway (considering it was a $1 rental special) and was blown away how much of a hidden gem this movie really is. Although it definitely deserves the &#34;R&#34; rating, it was well worth the money and more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totally awesome. I love this game. I play it everyday whenever I have free time. Play now. It is fun.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is THE BEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE THUS FAR. Hot women, lots of action (i.e. gunshots, fist-fights, chase scenes, etc.), a good story with twists and turns (i.e. heroes/good guys becoming villains); how could you not like this film? Some reviewers said \\"there's no storyline\\". I just mentioned the storyline in the previous sentence. Enough said. Some reviewers said \\"there's no character development\\". Is this movie based on a Shakespeare novel? No. This is a pure action-packed movie with lots of fun and hot women. What do you freakin' expect? If you liked \\"The Mummy\\" movies starring Brendan Fraser, you will love this film (same type of action, entertainment, hot women, etc.). If you're a straight guy and you said there's no storyline or character development in this movie, stop smoking whatever you're smoking.<br /><br />Note: I am definitely looking forward to G.I. Joe: Retaliation with \\"The Rock\\" and bad-a** Bruce Willis (one of the best, if not the best, action icons in movie history). Enough said.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun I play it all the time and I love it !!!! Its awesome
B0009A40ES|4.0|enjoyed the movie ,thought the purchase was well worth the money.The movie was shipped and received within a few days .The packaging was not over done.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this series! So imaginative and kept my attention the whole way through. I definitely recommend it to anybody who likes fantasy books.

B00AGKHEUI|2.0|I played it in both of my computers and my CD player, the songs start & stop in all of them.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is a thought provoking account of human survival.  The story is  well-written and utterly believable.  It is an excellent read.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|I had a good time with this game, in the first level. The second level where you had to kill the gargoyles, one of them had the name, and health bar, but he was completely invisible. I couldn't`t hit him no matter how hard I tried, so I ended up running out of time, and losing. So, because of that disgraceful level, I haven't played it for a few months and forgot about it till I got an email `bout it. Great graphics is the reason I didn't give it, 1. Well if you like being stuck on the same level, get it!! It's free!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's definitely putting a unique twist on an old game style. I enjoy the progressive style and the variables that have been implemented into the separate timelines.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Clever and action packed. Loved the concepts, love your style of writing. Expected a lot and was happy with the result.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game...But however it would be nice if it didn't take as many energies to play one game. Play it almost everyday.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Awesome app. I like the color of clock. I love the sleep timer. And I love the weather on it
B006LSZECO|4.0|This will make a fantastic movie. I would give it 5 stars for intrigue and not knowing what will happen next. I would definitely recommend it. The ending was a bit of a let down, but not enough to keep me from recommending it as a fantastic read.
B007EE564U|5.0|Mitch Rapp rocks.This is a great story. And the interweaving of the previous characters worked for me. Thanks for the great read.
159420411X|4.0|Ever wonder why economists, in general, seem to always \\"get it wrong?\\" Did the thought cross your mind that they seem not to be improving in their economic forecasting but get lucky once in awhile? How about the national weather forecasters - they seem to be definitely improving even though they drive us crazy showing us storm landfall models and giving us \\"percent chance of precipitation\\" numbers. Ever wonder how reasonable people can look at exactly the same data and come up with conclusions 180 degrees apart? The answers to these and many more questions are in Nathaniel Read (Nate) Silver's excellent book, The Signal and The Noise.<br /><br />Silver introduces us to Bayes's theorem. He does so in his now familiar comfortable style which allows those readers who are not also math wizards to understand the practical use of this probabilistic formulation. What's important to understand is that Bayes theorem requires that we take new information and initial conditions (prior beliefs) into account so that we continuously improve the forecast or prediction. This is something that, regrettably, many of us do not do. \\"Bayes's theorem requires us to state-- explicitly-- how likely we believe an event is to occur before we begin to weigh the evidence. It calls this estimate a prior belief.\\"<br /><br />Armed with the knowledge of how Bayesian thinking can and should be employed whenever we attempt to predict events in nature or human affairs, Silver takes us through many examples ranging from baseball to weather forecasting to earthquake prediction to demonstrate how practical (and difficult) all of this is for the forecaster. The most interesting example for me, and the reason I came to know of Silver in the first place, was his work on political forecasts. Silver has consistently forecasted correctly all 50 states in the last two elections using his methodology. And perhaps the most vivid example of how one can go wrong by ignoring Bayes, was when one prominent political hack on a conservative news channel refused to believe the election call his station made for which way Ohio would go early on election night. He did not consider his own prior beliefs when it came to his predications. That coupled with the fact that he had much on the line in terms of donors' money and his own reputation blinded him to the \\"new information\\" from the exit polls. He preferred to believe there was something wrong with the data. Had he been following Silver's forecasting in the NYT, he would have known that there was only a 35% chance that his candidate would win Ohio. As Silver noted: \\"The most calamitous failures of prediction usually have a lot in common. We focus on those signals that tell a story about the world as we would like it to be, not how it really is. We ignore the risks that are hardest to measure, even when they pose the greatest threats to our well-being. We make approximations and assumptions about the world that are much cruder than we realize. We abhor uncertainty, even when it is an irreducible part of the problem we are trying to solve.\\"<br /><br />My conclusion is, after reading Silver's excellent book, that I have to do a much better job making sure I am seeking out the real signal in the noise we all endure today. I will also have to make sure I question others who claim to have found the signal in the noise. Anyone who is required to provide forecasts (sales, budgets, returns on investments, market acceptance of products, etc.) must learn how to think in Bayesian terms and separate the real signal(s) from the noise. Nate Silver can help you do just that.hack on a conservative news channel refused to believe the election call his station made for which way Ohio would go early on election night.

159420411X|4.0|This book is the sort of book that you probably will read some parts word for word, other parts just skim. But IMHO you should read it if only to allow you to make more sense of parts of the world we live in.<br /><br />Nate Silver has managed to write an interesting even entertaining book about a dry subject. By applying it to many subjects - poker, politics, earthquakes, sports, terrorism, the financial debacle of 2007/2008 - there's bound to be at least some parts that everyone would find interesting. And his explanation of how to think about the probabilities, forecasts, and predictions associated with the various topics makes the book very readable.<br /><br />He has done a tremendous amount of research - probably the equivalent of 3 PhD dissertations - but it isn't the boring, pedantic prose of a dissertation. He interviewed a great number of experts and \\"people who were there when it happened\\" - Rumsfeld, Bush, Google executives, professional gamblers etc. - which adds to the breadth of the book. Having said this, please note that this is NOT a statistics textbook and those looking for that type of read will be disappointed. Instead, i think of this book as a window into a way of thinking.<br /><br />Not a book for everybody but a very enjoyable one for some.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Each charachter was developed beautifully. The story kept you guessing until the very end. I could not put the book down until finished. Loved it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fast and entertaining read. Story from the King Imagination Library never seems to be short of great ideas.  A Storyteller for our times, there's a reason I enjoy reading his novels over and over again, they never get stale or dated in my mind.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|So glad I read his.  Feel like I found my tribe at last. Well researched and written. An excellent read.
B002W24E0G|5.0|The sad news is that Nick passed away recently after a fight with mouth cancer.  But this is one incredible document to leave behind.  This is a crazy mix of 50's blues\R&B and post-punk rock.  Just buy it already.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|I've enjoyed Denzel Washington in many of his movies, but I didn't like the plot of this movie or the language. My husband and I watched it together, I bought if for him as a gift.  He didn't care for it either.  It did have a redeeming ending, but I wish I hadn't bought it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A very enjoyable fast paced read. This is a fantasy with a hero, his friends, enemies and benefactors.  Such an interesting view of books, history, cults, technology, and life. Now I need to spend some time really thinking about its meaning and how it affected me personally.

B00AZL3PBK|2.0|The concept is great...very Mario-like, but doesn't work for me on a GalaxySII. Two hands on a small screen too much to ask.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Written in such a unique voice, I had difficulty setting this book down. Both the subject matter and the plot twists are riveting.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I was in hospital for 3 weeks and watched this movie every day. Not to say that hospital entertainment is terrible but that every time I watched this video I discovered something I had missed in prior viewings. Great for a recovery and very entertaining. The lead characters are very believable and the FX'S are the best. I recommend highly.
0739366416|3.0|I liked the book but I ended up wishing it wasn't abridged. There isn't an unabridged version of this audiobook available. I mostly listened to it while I was driving in the car and it took me a while. I think I might have listened to the third CD three times as a reminder of where I was in the book.<br /><br />In 2007 when this book was published the national debt was $9 trillion and growing, this is a very small number compared to our debt now $16 trillion. Within the five year period of time the debt grew by $7 trillion. In 2009 when Obama took office the debt was already at $11 trillion dollars so yes the debt did increase under Obama but not as fast as it did in the last 2 years of the Bush presidency. I don't want to appear to be supportive of one side or the other but it does look like something needs to happen to try and cut spending and reduce the debt. Obama put forward ideas for this but it will be hard to implement any spending cuts.<br /><br />There are many things included in this book that are interesting and useful for those interested in politics. I'm not sure I would go so far as to say that this book offers a solution to our problems but I do think it gives you a little bit of an incite into how Obama began the political journey that lead to his becoming president.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those who are interested in seeing the differences in facts and the changing perspectives over time. I would have rated the audio book higher if it wasn't for the fact that it was abridged.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think this is a challenging game - sometimes it can be frustrating and the tunnel vision is hard for me to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever! if i could i would play this 24/7/365/ for the rest of my life. my favorite  game in the app store!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading Wool, and in the Q&A at the end, the author says that he reads all of the comments on Amazon. So, Mr. Howey, I would like to make a suggestion. I have read that Ridley Scott aquired the film rights. And I am sure it would make a great movie. But, I was thinking that your work might better be served as a television series. Networks have been looking for the next Lost, and it seems to me that you have written it. Your story, with it's mysterious setting, appealing characters, plenty of suspense, and many reveals, would lend itself to a series.  The quality of production and writing on television these days is exceptional, and it would allow your story to be told more fully, rather than chopping it down to 2 hours.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ***<br />Imagine an episode that concludes as Juliette's air supply is cutoff and she struggles to swim back to the surface in silo 17 ( Book 5, Chapter 66). The camera slowly follows her air hose up 4 stories to the generator, then pans down to reveal Solo lying in a pool of blood. Without a word the audience suddenly knows that they are not alone!  Fade to black. See you next week.  It would be great TV. Not sure if it is possible. If it becomes a movie, I will certainly go see it. But if it becomes a series, we will be able to watch it for years.
1416972250|4.0|I liked this book maybe more than the other books because Clary is more independent and she seems like stronger character. For a large part of the other two books Clary seemed helpless and in this she seems to be coming into herself and harnessing her individual power.<br /><br />Many readers will be happy to see a resolution to the Clary Jace romance issue. Saying more would give away parts of the other books but I saw this as a moral problem that was a struggle for the characters all of them, and not something that was going to be easily resolved. If a reader was going to be grossed out and not read because of that then my guess is that you will not make it to this book but it is resolved in a satisfying way.<br /><br />A new character Sebastian is introduced. There are many hits about him in here and anyone can pretty much guess who he is. This is how Clary describes seeing him for the first time.<br /><br />  &#34;She'd felt as if she'd walked around a corner in a strange city and suddenly seen her own brownstone looming up in front of her. A surprising and not entirely pleasant recognition, almost: How can this be here?&#34; (p. 175)<br /><br />I'm not sure there is much more that can be said about Sebastian with out spoilers.<br /><br />Valentine is at his best in this book although is isn't the biggest character and is discussed more than we actually see him in sense in the book.<br /><br /> This book I feel like was stronger than the other two books maybe because this could have been the end of the series.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Great read!  I like when a story involves many emotions. I laughed, cried, hoped and anxiously waited for a solution.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|This is probably the most affordable way to purchase all the most critically acclaimed readings of the symphonies out there. You have the intense, passionate LIVE readings of Klaus Tensstedt doing Mahler's 5th, and his transcendental Mahler 8th. You have Barbirolli's chilling, forward driving Mahler 6 which suceeds, inspite of it's unusually slower tempos in the first and fourth movements, and his magisterial reading of Mahler's 9th. Simon Rattle delivers a compelling live Mahler 7th with the CBSO, with it's brisker, livelier tempos, especially in the first movement, that prevents this work from lapsing into tedium. There is Jacha Horenstein's beautiful rendering of Mahler's 4th, along with the landmark Klemperer recording of Mahler's resurrection symphony, from the early 60's with the New Philharmonia orchestra. And to top it at the very end, you again have Rattle, this time with the Berlin Philharmonic performing Mahler's 10th. The Adagio here captures well the the music's manic , alternating moods of the mundane and the grave, while resisting its' inevitable descent to despair, which is so characteristic of Mahler's later symphonies. All in all, a fine and serious introduction to any casual or commited listener looking to explore the aural world of Mahler for the first time.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|I have a Sony Bluray player and the Season two Disc will not work ... I confirmed that my Firmware was updated and I had no problem with playing season one...It seems that the majority of seta are working based on reviews, but if you have a Sony bluray player model BDP you should be aware of this problem.
1416972242|3.0|This book much like the first feels a little reminiscent of Harry Potter. Characters grow a little bit and they go up against the bad guy, Valentine, whose name starts with a V. Just a question but do all bad guy's names start with V? Voldermort (Harry Potter), Volturi (Twighlight), Darth Vader (Star Wars, only sort of counts) alright so I can't think of any others. However, I do feel like this book has connections to both Twightlight and Harry Potter. Vampires play a big part in here so do werewolves, remind you of anything? If you can look beyond the comparisons for which there are many...the story is different and I like that.<br /><br />The urban setting is what really makes this story so good. The characters are interesting and becoming more developed as are their relationships. The plot is much the same as the first book but I didn't mind that as much as I thought I would.<br /><br />If you have not read the first book stop reading here. SPOILERS for book one<br /><br />Moral challenges are a big part of this story, the relationship between Clary and Jace. Isabelle and her rebellion against tradition. Alec and his feelings about being attracted to men, and hiding it. I like that Alec and Mangus have a relationship and that it is excepted by those that know about it.<br /><br />Mangus, warlock, becomes a bigger character in this book and I think that he is the most interesting of the new characters.<br /><br />Dreams become a new theme in this book which is carried into the next books as well.<br /><br />  &#34;Jocelyn moved the driftwood over her skin. The touch stung like the burning of a stele, and left the same think black line behind. The rune Jocelyn drew was a shape Clary had never seen before, but she found it instinctively soothing to her eye. &#34;What does this do?&#34; &#34;It should protect you.&#34; Clary's mother released her. &#34;Against what?&#34;&#34; (p. 132)<br /><br />Protection is another theme in this book. Who is responsible for protecting who, and have they failed or not? This is a question that is answered to most of the main characters and in some cases it is yes and some no. I also think we see how independence plays into responsibility and protecting someone besides yourself.<br /><br />In many ways the first book is more like a prologue to this and this is where the real story starts. We are introduced to Valentine in the last book but he doesn't really play that big a part in it. He is just the bad guy and not much of a character. In this book that is developed and he becomes a very horrible person. I think that was a necessary thing because otherwise I didn't really care that much about getting ride of Valentine he just was.<br /><br />I liked all the action in this book and the fast pass of much of it. Some of it was a little bit predictable but I think every book has some predictability.<br /><br />I will be continuing with the series and I am glad I gave it a chance.

0739321005|4.0|This is the story of Barack Obama before he becomes a politician. While the story is about an absent father and who this effects a young Barack. Race is another question that arises from having an African father and a white mother. Where does one fit in society and how can one proceed to have a black identity when living with whites?<br /><br />Spending some of his childhood in Indonesia with his mother and step-father taught him about history of a people and how it effects who we are and what we become.<br /><br />History of race and country is still with us and through this book we see one man's struggle and triumph as he learns to understand his past, his family ties, an unknown culture, and the importance of being true to oneself no matter what that might be.<br /><br />I wish that this hadn't been abridged but there was not an unabridged version of this book. I think that even those who do not like Obama politically will find this an interesting to listen to. This book isn't about politics it is about family and the struggle of understanding what that means.
0394800184|4.0|A beautiful book for first-time readers and parents alike.<br />A good book to put babies and toddlers to sleep with.

B00BETX5PS|3.0|I'm not a huge Bond fan but I have enjoyed the previous two Craig films.<br />This film seems a bit campy and formulaic with Bond chasing after some crazed villain who has every detail planned out and everything he does goes according to plan. Maybe that is how the Bond books are but as a movie it felt rote and I just wasn't entertained. I never felt worried or anxious I just felt like I was watching the formula of a cat and mouse game.<br />I also couldn't stop drawing parallels to Batman and Joker. Orphaned Bond hid under the family home for two days after his parents died and then rose up a man. Silva is running around with an unnamed crew wreaking havoc with impunity.<br />The first two Craig films seemed more realistic with Bond making mistakes and learning as he goes. This film seems like a step back where Bond, and especially Silva, are larger than life.<br /><br />Bottom line - nothing new here for me but not a film to pass up if you're curious.
1416955070|3.0|So I have to admit that I only started reading this because of the the movie trailer that I saw. I felt a little bit of hesitation when the copy I picked up had a quote from none other than Stephenie Meyer, &#34;The Mortal Instruments series is a story world that I love to live in. Beautiful!&#34; I had been looking at reading the infernal devices series because I really liked the covers. I have been hearing about Cassandra Clare for a while and did wonder if she was another Stephenie Meyer, who I believe to be one of the worst writers, but had decided to give her books a try upon seeing the movie trailer. I have a feeling the movie is going to be very very different from the book and I'm not sure it will be in a good way. I am glad that I did give the book a chance.<br /><br />This is not to say that I feel like her writing is very original. I wouldn't say that it is I can see aspects of Harry Potter, and yes I am aware she used to write Harry Potter fan fiction but I never read any of it. However, even I can see the connections. Mundie=Muggle. Then there are the similarities between Harry Potter himself and Clary, they both grow up not really knowing about the world they are really from and then things start happening to them that they don't understand. Okay so, seeing as I am not the biggest Harry Potter fan this did bother me a bit. I do think most authors to borrow from those that come before them but this was even a bit much for me.<br /><br />I do like the Urban setting of the story and how the world is our world yet there are things we do not see. It makes a city most are familiar with seem dark and foreboding yet tantalizing. The stories and myths told are all true which again I liked. There were times when I had a hard time keeping up with all the different downworlders, those that are not demons but that are not human, that were being introduced. Demons are in simplified terms aliens, not from earth.<br /><br />  'No way are we bringing her to the Institute,' said Isabelle. 'She's a mundie.' 'Or is she?' said Jace softly. His quiet tone was worse than Isabelle's snapping or Alec's anger. 'Have you had dealings with demons, little girl? Walked with warlocks, talked with Night Children? Have you--' 'My name is not 'little girl,'' Clary interrupted. 'And I have no idea what you're talking about.' (p. 15)<br /><br />This is the first time Clary meets the Shadowhunters and the first time she really sees something that others can't see. Simon her best friend can't see the Shadowhunters though and she lets it go. This is just the beginning of her being drawn into the shadow world.<br /><br />I maintained an interest in the story because there were twists in the plot. I saw most of them coming and, yes, I liked being right.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare has an interesting writing style and it wasn't exactly what I would have liked but I did like her descriptions of Clary's drawings.<br /><br />  &#34; The wings looked so real she imagined that if she brushed her fingers across them, they'd be soft. She let her hand trail across the page, her mind wandering...<br /><br />  And jerked her hand back, staring. Her fingers had touched not dry paper but soft down of feathers. Her eyes flashed up to the runes she'd scrawled in the corner of the page. They were shining, the way she'd seen the runes Jace drew with his stele shine.&#34; (p. 322)<br /><br /> I don't want to give anything away in the story because I really don't like it when I find out things before having read the book myself, discovery is part of the fun. This book is not for everyone the main character is female and I do think that limits the audience a bit even though their are major male characters as well. The movie I have a feeling will have a bit of a Twilight feel to it and I'm not sure that is a good thing. The book however, was not like Twilight.<br /><br />I will be reading the next books and hope they are better than this one and become more original. I do like the shadow world that is New York City.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game its sooo addictive like when you start you cant stop playing espically when your in rome
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a good alarm clock. Just wish the Kindle would light up when the alarm went off and you didn't have to hit the power button or screen to get the alarm to pop up.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Visually stunning; contemplative; touching.  I was so glad the ending was as it was.  I don't like sad stories - this movie really makes you think.  Oh, and another thing.  I am so sick of watching the same actors over and over again.  It is so refreshing to watch an excellent, yet unknown actor/actors!  And it was an awesome and inspiring story.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|If you've never seen it, just go ahead and buy it. It's really that good. Seriously. Promise. For real. Do it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The Dualshock's always been a good controller and this one's no exception. It's pretty much the same as you remember it, with triggers instead of buttons for L2 and R2, and the addition of the PS button and sixaxis motion controls. All in all, it's a worthy addition to the Dualshock family.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I've followed him for over two years awaiting his dream next release. As always...just like Live from the Redwoods...his music always speaks to my soul, my life and my dreams. Fantastically refreshing collection. Just love Gary and Georga too!

B007THA4FI|2.0|I realize Ms Rowling might have been attempting to break away from the HP image by doing something extremely different, but this book was not to my taste.  I had to force myself to finish it.  I kept waiting for something positive to occur.  The characters are all losers in one way or another, and have very few redeeming qualities.  It was depressing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark arcana has a really fun storyline. It's a Good balance of hidden object and other mini games. Would love to see more like it.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie for the kids.  They have watched it over and over.  Only, down fall was I purchased it for his kindle and I can't transfer it to a dvd to play in his room on the big t.v.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|It was cute but ultimately... there was nothing new to see here, very little depth and underwhelming during the &#34;big moments&#34;.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It's a good story but way too clinical and filled with scientific jargon to be compelling.  Not particularly spiritual either.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|Nice movie, good storyline. Halle Berry is good as the action hero and Sharon Stone as the villianess. Watch out dogs...
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is awesome. I used to do the workouts through youtube, but then decided I wanted the dvd. It is challenging and gives results!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|We previously saw this performance on public television.  The DVD picture quality and sound quality was better than the broadcast.  We have viewed this a dozen times and are not tired of it yet.  The best Bonamassa concert DVD we own (we have two others)!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|First off I love Nicholas Sparks books.  This was exciting, emotional and romantic all in one.  I also saw the movie, which didn't compare to the book.  Reading this story about an abused woman and the challenges she had to face was eye opening.  The bravery she was able to achieve inspite of what would have happened if she was found.  The idea that a man could be so weak that he had to beat on a woman was disgusting.<br />I enjoyed using my imagination while reading the story rather then seeing it on the big screen with someone elses interpretation.  I loved this book and have recommended it to others.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Realistic movie about high school 'misfits'. Good movie for Emma Watson to show that she can play something other than &#34;Hermonie&#34;.
B004XQO8JG|5.0|Watching this movie transported me to a wonderful world I had not been to in decades. One liners, infinite bullet clips, one man armies, complete and utter disregard for the law.... I love it and you will too.<br /><br />This movie is Stallone's Commando. yep, I went there.
0451196716|4.0|A truly amazing book by Stephen King.  The plot has already been hashed out numerous times by other reviewers, so I won't belabor a point.  Its good enough to say that this was a fantastic read.  That's not to say its a quick read, or necessarily an easy read (Some will find the content hard to take) but it is a book that you will probably have popping up in your head at random times years after reading.  (My most likely place to find it jumping out of my subconscious is at the gym, almost always on the treadmill.)<br /><br />For those who say the premise is ridiculous, that no one would sign up to a contest where 99% of the contestants don't survive, here's a heads up. Two million kids try to commit suicide each year... of those, about 2000 actually succeed.  Some people want to die, or think they want to... and in this game, once you've signed up and changed your mind its too late to do anything about it.  Its also made clear that their parents can't interrupt the recruitment process.<br /><br />Or maybe its the \\"immortality complex\\" that many teens (and adults) have, the mentality that you're the hero of your own story and there's no way you can actually die; the same complex that makes people drink and drive, speed excessively, run red lights, etc.  Throughout the book characters are constantly saying \\"It can't be me, I feel like I could walk for days\\"; \\"So-and-so won't make it, look at him, you can tell\\"; etc.<br /><br />On complaining that the book is about walking, and somehow this makes it a ripoff or disappointment.  First, its called \\"The Long Walk\\" so that should have tipped you off in the first place.  Second, The Walk itself serves as a device to move the story.  It could have been anything else, any form of game show or physical contest.  I'd imagine King picked The Walk more because it is something so commonplace; the book could then concentrate on its major themes, rather than having to explain a more complex set of rules to go with some game show.  (See the Hunger Games or its far superior predecessor, Battle Royale, both of which had to go into depth to explain their worlds and the game itself.)<br /><br />I could dig into the themes presented in this book, but honestly that would be opening up a whole barrel of worms, (or is it can of monkeys?) and I've talked enough already.  Overall opinion?  Sure, here it is.  Not King's best, but far from his worst.  Slow reading?  Yes, but not every book needs to be so light that you can breeze through it, sometimes the slower pace makes you think more.  (Something I imagine pi**ed of many of the lower star reviews, who apparently can't understand books that aren't spelled out..  Subtext, that's what you need to look for ya'll, though I realize thinking can be hard in between bouts of reality tv.)  If you think this book is slow try something like Foucault's Pendulum, then read this one again.  It'll breeze by, I promise.(See the Hunger Games or its far superior predecessor, Battle Royale, both of which had to go into depth to explain their worlds and the game itself.)<br /><br />I could dig into the themes presented in this book, but honestly that would be opening up a whole barrel of worms, (or is it can of monkeys?) and I've talked enough already.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|I came across this book by accident, and I'm glad of the opportunity. I found so many parallels to the challenges of everyday life in the current context and have been inspired to determine my 'how' in order to achieve the meaning of my life.

B001UFQNF0|5.0|My Delorean came to my front door on time and undamaged. As for the Delorean itself, I have to say everything looks just like the how picture shows and is a fun, cool model to play around with from time to time. For those people who complain about a missing Mr. Fusion, make sure you look closely in the box before throwing it away, if you're planning to do so. The Mr. Fusion is in a small plastic bag with the instructions, so don't miss out, cause it definitely finishes the time machine's awesome look. The model is great, overall. The wheels flip down smoothly for hover mode. Definitely recommend this to any Back to the Future fan.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Great movie, Helen Hunt takes on a different kind of persona in this true to life story. William H. Macy plays a priest so it is a joy to watch it.
B00684J49U|5.0|I could watch this show over and over. Great Price for Season 8 of Grey's Anatomy Season 8 on DVD. The shipping was fast and I had no problems. The DVDs were just as described. I would buy from this seller again.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a suspenseful and unpredictable novel written by Gillian Flynn in June 2012 and made the New York Times Best Seller list.  Gillian Flynn is a fairly new author and has written two other novels; Sharp Objects (2007) and Dark Places (2010).<br />Gone Girl is about Nick Dunne and his wife Amy Elliott.  When Nick receives a phone call from his sister that their mother is very sick, Nick and Amy decide to more back to Nick's hometown in Missouri.  Amy has been a city girl her whole life and has a difficult time adjusting to their small town life.<br />  Nick and Amy have been married for five years and while they did at one point have an incredible relationship, their marriage is now crumbling.  On the day of their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears.  Nick receives a call that his front door has been left open and the cat has gotten out.  When he arrives home he finds signs of struggle and other evidence that points to an intruder and the abduction of Amy.  As the first half of the book unfolds you learn of more clues that point to Nick as the lead suspect.<br />The chapters switch back and forth between Nick and Amy's point of view and their stories conflict which leaves you wondering who is telling the truth.  It is full of many twists and turns. Every time I thought I knew what was going on, the author added another twist.<br />While I truly enjoyed reading this book I was very disappointed when I got to the last page of the book.  I was shocked to see that was the end and flipped through the acknowledgments thinking there had to be more.  The entire book was so suspenseful and detailed and then it just ended with so many loose ends left untied.  Despite the ending I would still recommend this book to others.
B000FC130E|5.0|I recommend this book for readers of fantasy and sci-fi books that love suspense and wonder. Neil Gaiman is an extraordinary author

It is jam-packed with useful information.  (Some of which I was amazed that anyone had taken the time to figure out!)  I highly recommend adding this to your library!  This is one of my favorite purchases and I have no buyer's remorse with this one.

B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The second season for me was sort of a disappointment. There were a few surprises but overall I enjoyed Season 1 a lot better. What was up with the whole alien theme? It didn't seem to fit and it seemed pointless. This season was all over the place. It didn't seem to know where it was going or have one central theme. Aliens, demonically possessed nuns, Nazi scientists, serial killers, the horrible beginnings of mental health treatments (labotomy/ECT/conversion or re-assignment therapy (gay/lesbian). It was all over the map...and what was up with the whole &#34;Name Game&#34; musical number. It seemed to not fit.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the ease of using this app to play, especially the touch function.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing solitaire.

I grew up hearing about the War from my dad and even watching old news reels and hearing about all of the different planes.  My father loved them.  This gave me a new appreciation for both sides during the war.  Great story and wonderfully told.  Would and have recommended to everyone.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I still couldn't put it down even though I knew what was going to happen. Still my favorite book series
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Awesome lego! I had sworn i wouldn't get anymore lego, but when i saw this i had to have it, and it was well worth it! Anyone could spend hours playing with it, a must for all star wars lego fans!
B0098466CK|4.0|Good, but not the clarity & talent (musically) in their previous works.  Sword is still strong, if not as sharp as before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game in the world take it from me .I fall in love with subway sufers .Please buy the game and well enjoy you want stop till you drop!  :)
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Good game for preschooler. My grandson is 3 and he enjoys the gardening. Good for learning hand- eye, control with toddlers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just read it. Do it. I promise you won't regret it even for a moment. Absolutely beautifully written til the very end
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's awesome and all but we're are the other jetpacks and cloths that the iPhone,iPad and iPod touches got how come the kindle fire doesn't have them we don't even have one update
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amei! Li 2 vezes seguidas e pretendo repetir a leitura outras vezes! Os livros ensinam muitas coisas, especialmente como superar os traumas q a vida nos trás...
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|I love just about every track, the vocals and the metal sound are so awesome together. Really glad i decided to get it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. It is awesome and worth the seven bucks!!! I strongly sugest it for people of all ages!!!
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|All the praise for Argo is a lot of hype.  An interesting incident was drawn out into a movie.  While I applaud the story, the movie is thin.  Ben Afflick is self conscious as a person of that era. He grew his hair.  The rest of him was blank as a plank.  He is no actor.  The story would have been better srrvef if it wasn't written by Aflick, directed by Aflic, Starring Aflick etc. etc.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Not a bad game to kill some time  with, but it's not the greatest thing I've ever played either. The graphics are great but there is a lot of redundancy as well. Definitely worth trying the free version and deciding yourself if it's worth the $2.99 to unlock it. I don't think it is though.
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|I bought this album only knowing a few songs from this guy - Don't Owe You A Thing (which isn't on this album) and Bright Lights, and one or two others - and I expected mostly blues.  This has a lot of blues, but there's also some soul (for lack of a better word) and an automated drum here and there, which I didn't expect, but works well.  If you don't like blues or soul-ish music, then you should skip over this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever I play it everyday you need this game<br />I love to play this game and tun away from that guy and his dog<br />It is an awesome
B000W93CHC|5.0|I have gotten through half of the book (and it is a big book) and have not tired of it.  I know others give a detailed review of books explaining what it is about.  I on the other hand just enjoy reading historical fiction, especially fiction from the 13th, 14th and 15th century.  I read where Pillars of the Earth, in some readers opinion, was far better, but having read it a long time ago and still remember some of it, I am finding the story line here different and I am enjoying it just as much as I did Pillars of the Earth.  The characters are so varied and some are pitiful, some are heroic and some are steady.  I find the differences fascinating.  I like the way the women are depicted as bright and stoic even at that time.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie is just wonderful. Amazingly talented and absolutely beautiful. Love the songs!!!!! Listen to it over and over and over!!
B00136JS12|5.0|I bought this mostly because of Foreplay/Long Time, but I knew most of the other songs also.  A good buy if you like classic rock; if you don't like classic rock, this probably isn't for you.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|From the previews I expected another &#34;Airplane&#34; movie. The movie went far beyond my expectations with excellent acting from Denzel with a character portrayal of a troubled individual who addresses his personal demons regardless of the consequences. Excellent flick!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is on of my favorite authors and he did not disappoint me with the Panther.  There are so many varied opinion given on this book.  I can only say, give it a try.  I wasn't sorry!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is definitely one of my favorite recording groups.  This CD has so many of their greatest hits.  I highly recommend it.
B00136JQMI|4.0|Honestly, I'm not really sure how much I need to say about this album.  If you like jazz, or music period, you should buy this.  I don't think I should need to explain that this is a classic.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This movie captured the time period and actors with a modern twist. I never realized Hitchcock had such a good sense of humor. This movie is entertaining with good acting.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|An excellent read, buy 18 words?..really ?...an and Amy many no yes two one but it is over, or money is needed.
B005LAII1C|5.0|the movie is not for  kids or teenager  adults only state California 21 n over<br /><br />i wont lets my kids watch it if i had any
B00138KEH2|4.0|This is a mix of sturdy (sorry, I couldn't think of any other, better words) songs that, while they're all rock, manage to be nuanced enough to not sound exactly the same.  Also, Chris Cornell's voice is pretty good.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Loved this book, could hardly put it down.  Now on to her other books.  I'm glad she's written many, it will keep me occupied for quite some time.
B0073XORCY|5.0|I bought TAAB2 from Amazon.com a short time ago. It is a wonderful compact disc.... which, did I fail to mention, I bought from Amazon.com? I did. Ian Anderson does a masterful job of bringing Gerald Bostock into the 21st Century with all his failures, foibles and victories. Jeff Bezos and Ian Anderson: Wünderbar pairing!
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you think you know how it will end, you're dead wrong. It took me awhile to truly get into it, but once I did,I finished it in a day. It was a wonderful read.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is totally what I thought it would be so I am injoying it and would recommend it for others and definitly parents with kids cause it is pretty easy to play.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Loved it. Thought it was great. Just want to leave a review, but it says I have to have so many words.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great fun game lots of fun learning..I love my horse.. I wish she was real.. I reccomend it for all ages and it is especially great for kids who need to learn responsibility
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great book it was an amazing read rick riordan is a genius I really enjoyed reading this book it's brilliant
B004XQYBA2|4.0|Love Sudoku and it gives me plenty of puzzles to solve. Only downfall, the easy puzzles aren't as easy like I thought they would be.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|This is a light fun story where beauty and manners were still held in high importance. I enjoyed the performances of all the characters. Gwyneth is stunning and I think that she was perfect for the role. I love Jane Austin and this book really delivers a light fun plot that leaves you feeling good.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game is pretty good, I like the overall gameplay, story and all, however, the game has a problem with latency and is slightly bugged server wise.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another book club pick that I loved. I don't want to give anything away, but at each point in this book that I thought I had it all figured out....there was more. Read this book.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game was free to download and there is no ads while playing.  Most apps have ads unless you pay for the full version. Not the case here :)
B009XY97VC|4.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM. Don't get me wrong--Invincible and Archangel are extremely good too, and I don't regret buying them. But honestly, I'm pretty sure I've listened to SkyWorld FAR more than I have either of them. I adore cinematic-style stuff, but I don't constantly need overwhelming drumbeats, pounding electrical guitars, and prolonged choral arrangements to convey the urgency of a situation. I certainly don't need it to grasp less aggressive emotions, which might mean \\"Titan Dream\\" is my favorite song on this album (the sense of adventure in \\"Winterspell\\" is enjoyable as well).<br /><br />That's not to say SkyWorld doesn't have its flaws. Other than \\"The End is the Beginning,\\" which gets notice only because I do choose to listen to it occasionally, I'm really not feeling the lyrical songs. I REALLY don't care for \\"Back to the Earth\\"--the lyrics are probably very moving and inspiring, but I can't get over how the vocals are done, so I skip the song as fast as I can. Those aside, \\"Juggernaut\\" and \\"Dark Ages\\" are unquestionably my LEAST favorite songs on the album; as someone who uses music to create specific atmospheres for writing, I can imagine myself having no use for those two songs--especially \\"Juggernaut\\"--except in the event that I need to write a scene of chaos and death or the like. For the same reason I don't often listen to \\"Our Last Hope.\\"<br /><br />\\"All is Hell That Ends Well\\" gets special mention because I can't decide whether or not I like it. I don't hate it, but I don't listen to it every playthrough the way I do songs like \\"Titan Dream,\\" \\"SkyWorld,\\" \\"Winterspell,\\" \\"For the Win,\\" and \\"Blizzard.\\" I enjoy the orchestral elements, especially the piano bits, but it is a bit heavier than I need on a given day. I've encountered a lot of complaints about the dubstep at the end, but it's never struck me as the travesty others seem to think it is. It's strange because it's something TSFH hasn't really explored before, and I don't feel it needs to be pursuedtoo vigorously (I can get dubstep anywhere, after all), but it wasn't horrible. Still, I can understand that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.<br /><br />SkyWorld doesn't contain nearly the same percentage of driving, beat-you-over-the-head-with-ferocity music as you'll find in Invincible and Archangel. I suppose this is because Invincible and Archangel are primarily about individuals or small groups saving the world, as can be told by the song titles; by comparison SkyWorld is primarily about expansive landscapes and forgotten legends. So if you have to have music that pushes you through every second of your day--if you have/want to feel like you're about to go into a fight and take over the world or if you have/want to feel like YOU are the legend--you might not like this album. But if you want music you can build a world to, you might just find that SkyWorld is right up your alley.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it has great pics and has different levels(like 36 pieces or 58 pieces ect.).i wouldnt play it all day...maybe for about 1hour
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Loved this story.  My whole heart got wrapped up in it. Happily-ever-after comes in a lot of ways and thru ways you never imagine.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|So I bought this app off the amazon website because my kindle fire can't login to the appstore because my internet is to slow.  The amozon website told me to go to my app store on my kindle to download it and I cant find the app to download it.  I tried to buy it again in the appstore when I went somewhere with better internet but it says I already have this app.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Better than most new shows on TV. Good actors, good story. Each episode keeps you guessing. I will try to catch season 3 on fx when it is released
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i love temple run 2, buy my player dude always stays on the left side of the screen no matter how much i tilt it.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I downloaded this an hour ago and I love it, Videos, timer camera, fast and easy to access menu it's really nice!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game rocks!... But like most of these running games, I wish there was more than one borning level, it like you never win...
B00028HBKC|5.0|I think this movie is very close to what really happened to Jesus. Except what He looked like when He was nailed to the cross. I have a quote but don't remember where I found it.&#34; When He was beaten, His face was unrecognizable as being human.&#34; And at some point I will watch it again.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Another great book by Patrick. This is my third time through it. I can't wait for his next one. Hopefully it will be soon.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|OUTSTANDING book.  After reading this I immediately ordered 4hww and the 4hb, you need to own these works of art.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|The filmmaker did a wonderful job weaving a mystery.  However afterword I wished they had focused more on Rodriguez himself and his life.  Later after a google search I did feel sad that important facts were left out.  Australia??
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Genuiine inability to develop plot or subplots despite- AMAZING performance turned-in by Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Pointless movie!
B00AHXIC50|2.0|I liked just 1 song of the entire album, the rest sound more of the same... I'd rather just download that song than bought the entire album.
B00992CF6W|4.0|How do you host a wifi game on here i dont know how i wanted to play with mu friends
B006LSZECO|2.0|The beginning was hard to get into-too much descriptive language which can get boring to read after awhile- however I stuck it out. Her writing style eases up and the story becomes more interesting. Not my favorite book, but interesting enough for me to finish it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, so I planned to post after I completed 30 consecutive days, but it's taking forever and I can't contain my excitement any longer! LOL. I started 30DS on Ash Wednesday and committed to completing it for Lent (which is more than 30 days). My goal was to lose 15 lbs and be back where I was one year ago (135 lbs). However, at the rate at which I'm losing inches, I may have to just settle for being my old size instead of my old weight!<br /><br />I've really only lost 3 lbs as at the end of week 2, but my thighs are significantly slimmer and so is my torso. I'm still not seeing much progress in the waist area, but I still have a week and a half to go. I also plan to start with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism (BFBM) right after I'm done with 30DS so I can get enough cardio to really burn those problem areas.<br /><br />I'll be back at the end of 30 days to update on my progress, but I definitely recommend this DVD to anybody who's serious about slimming down, toning up and losing weight.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a good product for People on the run who hate to carry a lot of things around With them. Your phone as a book is just cool!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|There is nothing about this book at I didn't like! I would recommend it to everyone. Especially for anyone dealing with mental illness, whether it is you own illness or a family member.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|(cont'd) for people without this background.<br />The color and animation were great and very true to the Herge originals<br />from the comic books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was right up my alley, I couldn't put it down... until the end.  What a complete and utter LETDOWN!!!  I desperately hope Miss Flynn's other novels don't leave such a disappointing open end.  If I discover they do, this will be the last Flynn novel I read.  What a bummer!!
B003719GGS|5.0|This was an easy read.  Very informative.  I would highly recommend reading this book for anyone that is interested in truely improving their relationship.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Hopefully the beginning of a series, a mix in with elantris, this is an excellent work by Sanderson. A masterfully crafted set of characters with a beautiful magic foil.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|typical super story by Mr. Sparks, very believable,  movie was well done also.  I just can't believe that Nicholas Sparks is such a great writer of love stories.  He really knows how the female heart feels.
0307887898|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was able to take away quite a few actionable items. I had a few hang-ups with it though that I think others should be aware of.<br /><br />Very first, the book is mistitled. I knew what it was about going in but I've spoken with others that had a misbelief about the content. This book is not about bootstrapping a new business or being scrappy, which is how &#34;lean&#34; is often meant. But rather, &#34;lean&#34; comes from the principles of lean manufacturing. This is a minor point, but thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />Secondly and more important, I thought certain sections lacked specificity. For example, Chapter 7, which is about &#34;innovation accounting,&#34; does not provide as much of a framework as I would have liked. There was a bunch of build-up before that chapter about how I would learn the secrets of said accounting and felt that the chapter fell pretty flat. I understand that Eric is intentionally vague so that the idea can be applied to any sector, but I finished the chapter unclear about how to apply it.<br /><br />Last, Eric's background is tech. So the examples are largely tech. I completely agree that the principles can be successfully applied to other industries. And as such, I would have appreciated some more examples from other industries.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Moving emotionally, thought provoking how vulnerable women can be as well as how resilient.  A book I will recommend often.
B008MILL9G|5.0|If you like these movies, you'll like them better on blu-ray. If I had owned them on DVD I likely wouldn't have upgraded though...
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Brave is a beautiful movie with great music and voice actors, but the story and characters just aren't there.<br /><br />The theme of a bonding mother and daughter is a refreshing change, but the whole movie is based around this idea of self sacrifice for the greater good and a comparison between the protagonist and a mythical prince that led the country to ruin through strong feelings of entitlement, but she never changes, she's no more willing to sacrifice than she was at the beginning. The only difference is she is closer to her mother and manages to squirm out of the consequences for choosing her own happiness over duty as the story became less about the conflict of her arranged marriage and instead is about changing her mother who is turned into a bear back to a human, which she might have also tried to ignore if it wasn't for the fact that her mother would have died in the end if she had.<br /><br />In Brother Bear, which was not only made first by Disney and would have made this movie redundant if they'd called it Mother Bear. The protagonist actually sacrifices his human life to make amends for the pain he caused another. If you are familiar with that movie then consider what the moral would have been if instead of changing himself, he pushed the bear cub he unknowingly wronged to change into a human instead to fix the problem and you'll understand what I took from this movie. I didn't see Brother Bear win any Oscars, but to be fair it did lose to \\"Finding Nemo\\".<br /><br />But in this movie the protagonist doesn't change. By the end she finally listens and somewhat understands what could have been the result of her stubbornness, but she never has to make any sacrifices because the world bends to her wishes and she gets her way.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm too focused on this point but it seems to be a common concept these days that a stubborn and free-willed character is a strong character. It isn't, she isn't. I found her to be unbearably annoying at times. Inexample, she has just given her mother magical food poisoning and even while her mother is huddling in pain, she continues to ask if she has changed her mind about the wedding. Then her mother crawls to her room and collapses and we don't see any concern or guilt we get. \\"So I'll go ahead and tell them the wedding is off shall I?\\"<br /><br />Yes, the mother and daughter had some emotional bonding. Why? Because the daughter fed her mother with a magic danish that ends up turning her into a bear and is then forced into hiding so her oblivious husband doesn't kill her from his blind vendetta against bears.<br /><br />Why did the daughter ignorantly poison her mother?  Because she was being forced to marry one of three suitors, which of course all had to be baboons in some way or another to try and force the audience to pity her, instead of finding her motives selfish as they would have if the suitors had been decent people. (In fact I can't think of a single male character in this movie that wasn't a muscle-head or to put frankly, a dork.)<br /><br />The mother even explains how selfish she's being and how her stubbornness could destroy their kingdom/clan. Her response from what I remember has the undertones of \\"so what.\\" I had no problem with all of this until the end. After all, a character is supposed to work through their problems as the story goes on, but as I've made clear this doesn't happen. I was more interested in the magic and the mythical fallen kingdom than anything to do with the protagonist.<br /><br />I agree we need more pro-feminist movies in a genre filled with Damsels and Prince Charmings, but this is not how you go about it. So three stars for the great soundtrack and incredible graphics and setting, but little more beyond that.<br /><br />Forgive the title but in my opinion, Little Vanellope from Wreck-It-Ralph was braver and more likable than Merida and I feel Disney was pushed under the rug simply because it was Pixar that made this movie or perhaps the Video Game subject matter of Wreck-It-Ralph wasn't as refined or mature as they wanted, but from personal opinion I felt the general choice had nothing to do with the actual movies.
0812993292|5.0|Great, unusual story.<br /> I'm giving it as a present to my daughter, who is a very demanding reader. I have sent excerpts to others.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun I love taking the pictures of the horses you should get the game if u love horses
B002VECMAO|3.0|It's an interesting idea and I laughed now and again but I'll not likely watch it again. I'm not going to go into it but don't spend more than $5 for this movie--no reason to buy it on blu-ray either if you can get it on DVD for cheaper.
0151001634|5.0|This is a classic every home library should own<br />I love the story and the story line you just can't put it down
B001JIDE3M|4.0|No language, very little romance. Good, clean family adventure. Mild peril, but not more than our 9 & 11-yr-olds could handle.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I really enjoyed and appreciate the amount of thought and research that went into the book.  Give it a read.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|my horse is a game in which you get to take care of your own &quot;horse&quot;. i think it is a pretty fun app.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a fun game about three friends trying to escape a mean patrol officer after them for doing graffiti on subway train
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Watched this excellent movie for the second time since its release in 2008.  Yes, the second time - and I don't really care for westerns.  Appaloosa is an excellent film on several levels though, and unlike most westerns, it ends well.  I hope that doesn't qualify as a spoiler, and I apologize if it does.  It's just that I'm usually afraid westerns (and other dramas) will end tragically, and I avoid them.  (I realize tragedies are carthartic, but can I help it if I want to feel uplifted at the end of a movie?)<br /><br />I highly recommend Appaloosa.  It had a realistic, &#34;modern&#34; quality not found in most westerns.  A very cool movie I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />I would have given it five stars if not for the following:  I would have cast someone different than Renee Zellweger as Allie.  I've never understood the appeal of this actress.  She's annoying and unattractive.  I don't get it.<br /><br />I would have also re-produced the audio.  I had to turn on subtitles so I could hear and understand most of the dialogue.<br /><br />Otherwise, a five-star movie.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|I've always been a huge Jimmy Page fan. This documentary has made me a Jack White and Edge fan as well.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Cannot complain on this one. Another mind bender. Great read, keeps your attention and I did not want to stop reading.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Very inspirational due to the fact that Rodriguez is so humble during the entire film. I would have never thought that something like this could have happened!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use and does what you need, when you need it. Let's me know immediately where I am with bidding, even at work and in meetings. Grest app! Love it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks has put an almost too real human emotion and surrealism into this novel. From each character and the different experiences that they faced of the war as horrific as it is Max brings everything that the human experience can muster in such times from racism, bigotry and genocide to mercy, humility and forgiveness. The human spirit and body endures so much to survive such horrors that is so unimaginable that only Max Brooks could bring.
1878424319|5.0|After I read this book, I was so impressed that I bought several more copies for family members.  I would recommend this book to anyone.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was interesting... a bit boring in the beginning but I'm glad I read the whole thing..good read for anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is amazing it is really fun but I think the different countries should automatically be downloaded so you don't have to download it but I still love it!!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game took for ever to download and I was only able to play the porch and get just inside a window when I was cut off and asked for money. Ya know, I don't mind being asked for money but I need to know how much money. The hidden objects were ok but you couldn't really zoom in. Since they wont say how much I don't think I 'll purchase it, especially if it's more than $0.99. Just not that excited about it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great Movie!  I could watch this over and over and over and over and over and over and, well you get the idea.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a awesome game that everyone will love I do I have to play it everyday I beat a lot of.leavels

B004XQYBA2|5.0|There is just so many puzzels not just classic but the variations sudoku. I recommend the game if you love sudoku.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I usually don't buy games but this is 100% worth it!!!! It's just like grand theft auto only better. The only reason I'm giveing it 4 stars is because it's little on the laggy side but other than that it'd GREAT
B00B8ESWAM|1.0|This movie inspires nothing, does nothing, and was a complete waste of film and time.  I want to rip my eyes out and then eat them and mail the s*** to the director.    This movie should have all copies collected and burned.    regretfully  someone who has seen it
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Because I love fantasy books and the story line looked interesting, I bought this, only to be disappointed.  Writing is fragmented and proof reading very poorly done.
B008OJ291W|5.0|ELO at it's finest. It was so good, affordable and arrived within days of ordering. I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for a friend. I would highly recommend this if you want some classic ELO tunes.
B005651RDS|5.0|When I first started to read Mister Pip, I thought can I get into this? Two pages later, I was hooked. What a great read! I struggle to find time to read, with my busy lifestyle. I found Mister Pip to be a book that had a great story line, and one that had twists and turns at every corner. I loved the characters in the book, and thought it told a wonderful story of life lessons, through one brilliant child's journey!
B004I1AGTC|5.0|There is not much more I can say about Donnie Yen. He is full of action, serious, athletic, I love it!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|With all the review you kind of knew the ending.  It was good movie from beginning to the end.<br />My wife saw it twice.
B008Y73940|5.0|Suspensful and intreging! Would highly recommend it and I have to all my friends! Glad it was available for my viewing!
1594487154|5.0|We've all read books with great stories OR plowed through texts with solid research OR, on occasion, were lucky enough to find materials where common sense ruled the day.  To Sell is Human actually combines all three in one book. If you are in sales you need to read this book.  Everyone's in sales.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I love Donnie Yen!!! He is wonderful! He is my generations Bruce Lee! Bring on more of his movies, I will buy them all!
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Richard is one of the best Rock n' Roll artists of this era. This CD will have you rockin' your way through even the darkest of your days! His voice and energy will pull you off the couch and have you dancing through the house!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|helps mt kinle work great! glad I downloaded it. Would recommend to my friends. Fast and professional service. I am very happy.
B006CHML4I|2.0|Watch looks GREAT.  absolutely othing to complain about on that front.  It kept good time as well, but about five months later it started to stop in the middle of the night for hours at a time.  Now every morning the time is wrong -quite annoying to deal with.  Will try to see if their warranty will replace the watch and update with results.
0765325950|5.0|This book was amazing. It had everything that you could hope for. Sanderson paired with Jordan perfectly. It was a satisfying ending.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|This brilliant book will open new worlds to the reader and expand the mind beyond all boundaries of objective science.  The writer opens an enticing portal into the virtual world of quantum consciousness. I trust we will hear more from this genius mind in the future!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this game!!!  I couldn't survive if I did not have it! (love it like heck) get the game!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game, there are so many creative details and characters. I only wish it didn't take so long to recharge the energy levels.
1881273377|5.0|I read this book and knowing my partner prefers the cd for long drives, i picked up a copy for him... It has really changed the way we communicate!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|One of the best app for android smart phone, I really need those 5 GB's like extra storage folder and allways on hand everywhere...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|such a fun game, my daughter loves it. I have fun playing it too I wish there were a easier way to get gems but other than that its a really cute game
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I watch this new one thinking I would get to see all the cool stuff from the original done in today's technology. But this new movie had a different plot that did not include anything from the original like that (except the 3 boob lady). Kinda disappointed.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|After everyone raving about this book, I felt I had to see what the fuss was about.  I have tried, but I just cannot get enthused - I would be exaggerating to say I made it past chapter 3.  I find what I have read of the book irritating and far fetched.  I thought I was the only one who didn't enjoy it, but I am glad to see I am not alone.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|its great! I love this game!  I can't get it to work. on my new tablet or I wold give it hihghest rating possible!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great mindless fun for winding down.  I got sucked in even as an adult!  I would and have recommended to friends.
0440244412|5.0|This is the last book and as gripping as the first ones. You never know what new twists and turns are going to happen. Loved the whole story line.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|It is entertaining and keeps you wanting to read more.  Romance, action, comedy...and it doesn't have all the boring war scenes like other fantasy series.
B00BESM14U|5.0|At the insistence of my daughter, I had to rent this movie.  It is her favorite movie...gives her hope and inspiration.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is great for killing time and clearing your mind. Not exactly easy but not so hard that it makes your head hurt either. So many choices available for free then inexpensive additional puzzles too!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|WWI is over and things are starting to get back to normal except.....everyone has changed.  Particularly the women.  Everything is there from the first two seasons, the drama, the heartache, the triumph  but the war has changed everyone and in a sense Downton  becomes less a guilty pleasure and more of a historical piece.  I love the series but could have done with one more year of dinners and frocks and filtered wine before the war took over.  As the Dowager Countess said &#34;1920! Is it to be believed? I feel old as Methuselah.  When I think what the last 10 years has brought. God knows what we're in for now.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Since I don;t use that much, every time it changes, I have a hard time navigating it. I am always having to ask friends how to navagate.  I liked it better when all friends messages come through, not just a few in bunches and have to search for what other friends are saying
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|My wife loves the Lee Child's Jack Reacher. Tom Cruise was so not like the lead character she refused to see the movie. What is wrong with the people who produce these movies. The person playing the characters should at least somewhat resemble them?? When the movie is in the $5 dollar and under bin, I might buy it and try to get her to watch it.Que sera, sera.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love the app, just as good as being on the computer.  You can buy and sell right from your phone.
B005723JSQ|5.0|My favorite beach read of the year.  Fun, and with a couple twists that take it out of the comic romance formula.  Breezy, articulate style.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|The book was overall great. I think the Percy Jackson series was easier to read because this series features Egyptian gods and talismans.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|little dissapointed in the lack of gadgits and lack of music<br /><br />good movie but just ok for a James Bond 007 movie
B003K16P3M|5.0|Very good story, I enjoyed it a lot and I would recommend it to others.  I'm looking forward to more works by the author.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This case is really good for recharging your bluetooth while it's stored, especially while traveling.  It is magnetized, so the earpiece stays really well.  It has space for the cord (also magnetized) but I've never figured a good way to have the earpiece and the cord in the case simultaneously and have the case close completely.  If it ad done that, I've have easily given it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I think this is a great game because it's just like your on a Android but you  on a kindle
1616551100|5.0|Jamie Chase did an amazing job on the graphics of this book.  They really bring the story alive!  Fabulous work!
1616960922|5.0|Very good story, I enjoyed it a lot and I would recommend it to others.  I'm looking forward to more works by the author.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|I keep dying :( I've seen a couple reviews complaining about how long it takes to get back to the screen to try again when you fall off the platforms... Admittedly, it was cool the first couple times (you explode and the graphics are sweet :3 ) but it gets monotonous. I need to practice a lot more to advance to the next level but at this point, I've become bored with it.<br /><br />I did give it 4 stars though,  because I'm trying to help bring it's average up. It deserves more than 2.5 (feeble attempt, I know)
1616550414|5.0|After a long waiting period, it finally came to the US! It was worth the money it cost. Yes, when it arrives the corners are VERY slightly bent, but it was worth it. It even came earlier than it was estimated. Totally a great buy :D.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Just starting to use it, very nice. Easy to access, and use. Better for me than a calendar.  Nice tool.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|How can you not like Dawson, Pacey, Jennifer and Joey?  Brings back the high school years of drama and heart touching moments.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't put it down going to start the 3rd book right now. Biggest surprise ever at the end of this one!!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It doesn't let me type in the word that I want and need to go to. Instead it makes me go through the whole dictionary before I can find the word that I need.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Just started using, and so far it's okay.  Haven't taken the time to try all the features, so I can't comment.
B007JMW46U|4.0|Everything was great, but if you are looking for the illustrations (I wasn't), be aware that they do not show up on a Kindle unless maybe a Kindle fire.  Otherwise, the illustrations were not essential to most of the stories, especially if you are not reading them for the first time.
0762761296|5.0|Can't put it down. Tough people in an impossible, no choice situation. A tremendous survival story. Very well written, also.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I highly recommended this excellent book. It had me hooked from the first page and I couldn't put it down!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book , it kept me up reading  all night! I would recommend this to all
B008YRTWM8|5.0|Thought i already had a copy of this dvd,,, it was great to see the movie again, as this is one of my favorite of all time!!!!
0385737947|4.0|A young man comes to on a upward elevator. He has no memory of how he got there, where he is going or what his life has been  That would be a frightening predicament for anybody. It is the sort of beginning used many time in computer games, but doesn't quite work here. The beginning was very slow, because the young man who tells the story has his memory wiped. So, much of the time in the beginning, he walks around trying to get people to tell his what is going on. They tell him to shut up and wait until he has some training. He sulks and asks some more. I did keep reading, but was willing to stop at any time during the first half.<br />Things get even more complicated, when a young woman arrives in the elevator and he somehow recognizes here.  Oh, there are the usual YA complications - guys that take an instant dislike to him and try to bully him around, younger, weaker kids that latch onto a stronger boy. You can read any number of reviews that will tell of the plot, maze and all, and that part of the book was interesting, so I will not do it here.<br />Some things that did not work for me -predictable &#34;shocking&#34; deaths, the fact that after 2 years, no one had figured anything out and our hero does right from the beginning, and the thin female character, who doesn't really have much development, although for a good reason.<br />The twists and turns at the end are fairly predictable. I think that younger readers will be more invested in the story and less jaded to the surprises, which did not surprise me. . Still, it was good enough to hope that the other 2 books are that good. I plan to read the next book and hope that it is good. Now that we know the story that was wiped from their minds, it could be an interesting one. I do wish that the writing had been stronger and more involving.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|Incredible findings, as with most documentaries there are two sides and with environmental issues there are trade-offs, but his environmental investigation seems well done and eye opening
B0034DGPEU|3.0|It was O.K., it held my interest.  When I was finished I was glad the book was over.  When I really enjoy a book I am sorry to see it end.  Not the case with the Kitchen House.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Had a little problem setting it up on 2 machines, using the USB3 port... it kept disconnecting & 'acting up', but worked OK on the standard USB ports.  Keep in mind that this is ONLY a GPS receiver and the software to run the device... there is NO mapping or navigation software... you will need to use it with MS-Streets & Trips or other GPS-compatible software to use it for navigation.  I have not tried it with common GPS programs... this one is being used with Tiburon software for Fire/EMS call handling and routing, so I can't speak to how it would work with over-the-counter GPS software.  For the purpose I'm using it, it works OK.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Very pleased. Was very happy with this product. Even though it was used it worked very well. Will buy again.
B005PK56TA|5.0|We kept thinking we should have watched this series. We enjoyed it so much that we watched the whole season in one weekend.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|OMG this brings the best memories. this is a movie everyone needs to own bec it is  a classic movie
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This is always a Great movie. It's still as funny as it was when it first came out. So many quotable lines.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best, the missons are challenging its very addictive and i love it lots. I highly recommended it for any age.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|not Xeon tarruugyygy does Christmas down John don't jj HDTV January James July Xbox very hardy uhh game use how
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a wonderfully useful app. I frequently use this at home and while traveling to check the availability and status of Wifi networks in my location. It provides several different views of the network. The graphical views are clear and intuitive. It has great potential for network administrators, and is useful for the amateur as well. Well thought out and well executed. It is more than worth its price.
0525953728|4.0|have not rear it yet, but my grandson's basketball coach gave his copy to him to read, and he said he could not hardily put it down, untill he finished it
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Most underrated actor of our time.  He's convincing in every role he takes. (Bruce aint bad either.)<br />It was a cool story.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I'm about to throw my kindle if this game dose not start. I have continuously been patient with this game for a few days,  and I still cant get past the download part. you need to fix this freaking game so I can play out my childhood dream of owning a dinosaur park!!!!!!!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Got to say This is one of the funnest movies to come down the pike in a long time, If you like sick and vulger comedy this is for you best 3.99 I have spent in a long time.
0062238868|4.0|have not read it yet, probably will not untill spring when i go north, that is when i do all my reading, but with the other books ordered it was frt free, so i am satisfyed with the purchusaes
B000002HRE|5.0|Much like the deeply underrated Load - Reload is or rather was, a new incarnation of Metallica, a dark, bluesy and polished beast. Gone are the Lovecraftian lyrics and long hair but the experimental Metallica still remains. Carpe Diem Baby and Slither have some serious (slow and grinding) metal riffs and Where The Wild Things Are is infused with great melody and atmosphere. Like Load, the production is amazing, all gloriously deep bass pedals and full, thick and layered guitars. Whilst it may not be a classic as such, Reload is still an impressive rock album. After The Black Album there came more musical colour and different lyrical themes. Still heavy. Still unique. Still Metallica.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|If you rent this movie like I did thinking it was going to be another of the Bourne movies.  Go get some aspirin because you are going to be doing a big forehead slap just six minutes into the movie realizing that you are watching a truly crappy rip off and now you also have a headache. Take my advice take the aspirin, rate the move as low as possible &#34;I hated it&#34; and turn it off.  In the end you will be glad you didn't waste your time on this time suck, without  any entertainment value. I have seen 1960 Kung Fu movies that made more connections. Was this a spy thriller or bad Sci Fi - was there even a script or did they just film a bunch of chase and fight scenes all of which go on way too long to the point you hope that all of Washington DC gets nuked by aliens so it kills everyone because you don't even care - how did this tie into the Bourne Legacy? Oh it didn't and then they set it up for yet another movie - this movie completely jumped the shark and then burned the jacket. DO NOT RENT IT!!!!!<br /><br />.  I do like Jeremy Renner - but really can't  you guys actual write the script before shooting the movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Intense, creative, and a terrific set of characters.  I felt like I spent a year on mars myself. Great sci fi book.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Exquisite CD from Doris Day. Her fans will cherish and love this. Particular favorite is Disney Girls,but I love them all. What a lady ! With a well deserved long career.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Zac Brown Band is awesome and Zac Brown is focused on helping others.  I'd buy anything from ZBB - to help him help others.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was the best one that I have seen in four years and I see hundreds of movie a year. Ben Affleck didn't get the best director but we all know he should have.  The weekend before I rented this movie I saw the sixty minutes special about the actual<br />CIA agent that this film was based on - it would be great if the directors cut of this film had that interview with it or one like it.  It didn't spoil the movie at all it just made it ten times better.  So here's a two thumbs up - I suggest that you have a watch party and invite friends over to see it.  Make sure to include adult that remember the event and have them talk about their &#34;Flash bulb memories&#34; of what they were doing when they heard the US embassy had been taken.  It makes it even better.
B0091THRCU|2.0|While the outside leather of this case is good with attention to details, three items were lost in the design. The material inside of the pocket is not smooth and does not protect the screen neither the back of the phone, it acutually scratches it. They should use a super smooth fabric. The strap to pull the phone from the inise, should pull the phone fuher out. There is no need to have the phone to fit so tight in the inside.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|When this CD was out luckily I got to see them in concert. Wow ! Lots of fun as you'd expect. It's all good with a special fondness for I Don't  Feel Like Dancin'.
B005ISQ7JM|4.0|Anyone needing to understand the overal jest of html5 will benefit from this book. The book was very was to read and i was able to better communicate at my recent job interview.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Product purchased already broke after several weeks of moderate use. Contacted LifeProof about the warranty and they told us the serial number reflects it's a counterfeit product and they won't honor the warranty! Will be notifying Amazon about this product.  Caveat emptor!
B009GEEMLY|1.0|This review will not deal with the movie, which I enjoyed as much as I could considering the tech frustrations. EVERY time I have purchased an HD movie to stream via Amazon, I have had problems with the movie stopping and/or the quality of the stream deteriorating to sub-DVD quality.  This doesn't happen when I watch HD movies on Netflix, which is running through the same Roku 2. In fact I don't recall having these problems streaming free Prime content. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing any more HD streams from Amazon.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an awesome read! I considered this book b/c reviews compared it to fifty shades, and they were so right. I love this kind of messed up love.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I choose a 5 star rating because this book is so remarkable and relatable. I absolutely loved the whole book. I recommend everyone to read it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found the trilogy to be very entertaining.  Even my husband loved it.  I recommend it to everyone for<br />great reading.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Great musicians who give their heart and soul to these songs.  Great chemistry giving a powerful voice to the songs .
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a great book. I don't think it was quite as action packed as the previous books and you got an inside look at what Annabeth is really like. It was great to have a story told from more than just Percy's perspective.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Enjoyed the read but would once like to see stone get his woman!<br />Nevertheless less I will read the next book I am hooked.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|If only for how hilarious Josh Brolin deadpans the younger Tommy Lee Jones. Action is only so-so. Will Smith uninspired. Villain very weak
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This sequel is full of emotions. It really has you hanging on to the end of your seat, not wanting to put it down.
B001O4XWJM|5.0|Beautiful adaptation of Parker's book. Perfect casting. great movie!! You have to hope they will do the other Parker novels in the series. However it does not look like the box office was big enough. Shame!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its alsome you should try it. It is the best game ever you should really try the this great people really. Love itttt
B00190OHD6|5.0|It was an amazing feel good movie..Loved it. It had comedy, sadness and just makes ya feel good. Great movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When we travel my kids play use this app all the time it is their favorite, they fight over my kindle they love it so much!
B00008RH1H|5.0|I have never been able to get into Macbeth but found this movie fascinating.  It is definitely one of Kurosawa's best and ranks up there with other Kurosawa samurai movies such as Rashomon, Seven Samurai, and Yojimbo.<br /><br />The most compelling part of the movie is the visual images that Kurosawa uses.  These include the medieval Japanese war costumes, the natural mountainous scenery, the fort, and the horse scenes.  Kurosawa uses the fog almost as well as the reeds are used in Onibaba and the sand is used in Woman of the Dunes.  The horse scenes show how difficult it really is to control a war horse, something we usually don't see in other movies.<br /><br />While Kurosawa stays true to Macbeth by having a witch make prophecies, I would employ a more realistic and modern method by having the protagonist hear voices which would really be his imagination.  I would also eliminate the trees \\"attacking\\" the fort and just have the opposing forces attack the fort as there is enough fiction here already.<br /><br />The final scenes showing the attack on the fort are certainly some of the best ever filmed.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I LIKE ALL THE DRAMA AND SCIFI MYSTERIES THAT WRITERS SPEAK TO AND THE ACTORS CONVEY ROMANTIC AND TROBLE TIMES. JK
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like to play it and when I do I am not bored any more. My hole family tries to do their best .
B00992CF6W|4.0|it needs work on its creative mode like having Tnt explosion and being able to go too the nether other than that ILOVE IT
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is great full of wonderful creations and love the colors and frames.its the best ever have to get this!!
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I bought this for my husband for his thirtieth birthday, I gave him a &#34;zombie Apocalypse&#34;. He had to defeat &#34;zombies&#34; to receive the thirty other gifts I had bought him. This was amazing. Very VERY accurate shot. My only disappointment was that we didn't get the full &#34;ammo&#34; capacity - it's an added item to buy. *I suppose I missed that somewhere in the description*
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Although the subject matter is unsavory, the story, presentation, and acting are all stellar.<br />Weeds was the first show to make &#34;suburban drug dealing&#34; ... palatable(?). But that show is all dark humor.<br />This show is high drama, and the two principal actors have an amazing chemistry. (No pun intended.)
B00049QQHI|5.0|I have been fighting my addiction to alcohol for 30 years. Alcohol is a drug. This movie is about drugs. It tells you what you need to know starting out in dealing w/a person who is addicted. It is not about casting, direction, etc. Surely it paints w/a broard brush, but it does what it must: addiction and the price paid.<br />It depicts the slavery of addiction, don't expect glossy and glowing.
0060589469|3.0|I bought this as a cult read.  It's kind of long-winded, but a nice, romantic look at the life of owning a motorcycle.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|These DVDs play on the monitor at the doctors office and I wanted to see more and share them with my grandson.  I am pleased with the quality of the photography and the editing....

B006MW3V6U|5.0|So many insights into the role of each of the main characters in the story.  Even after viewing the series it is fun to consider how each character fit the role envisaged.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I think it is FUN and I like it  and it don't mess up and also when I am bored I would play this game
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Very funny movie and very true to the time period.  It brought back a lot of memories.  Don't know how this movie was received by those who were portrayed as the uppity whites, but things sure have changed!
