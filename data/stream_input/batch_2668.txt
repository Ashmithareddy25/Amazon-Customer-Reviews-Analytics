1781162646|5.0|This is a two-night easy read from Stephen King. His horror plot is light and not gory. The plot moves along as you wold expect King's books to move. The characters are likeable and all of them have a very different personality that appeals to any character type. The storyline is interesting and you will l;earn a lot of carney-talk and the inside story of this fictional show. There is a life message for the reader as most of King's books from after his accident tend to do.<br />This book was excellent and worth the read. No nightmares, no unsettling blood and gore, no hurry-up-and-wait for suspense: this one is on cruise control from the start. You will enjoy the subtlety and crystal-clear-top-down-view of this short book. Definitely worth a few hours of your life.
B004SGWYW4|4.0|Very entertaining, enjoyed the story line but would like to see a sequel. It makes you wonder how they survive.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This show is a must for Warehouse 13 fans! Give it a try & don't judge the show by the fist episode of season 1.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Queensryche has recaptured its vintage sound and demonstrated why their collaborative writing process was so important to them as a unit.  Fans of their earlier music should love this new album!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game.  A couple levels made me smack myself in the head when I realized the answer
B0011Z50VM|5.0|If you are a fan, this is one more reason to love Staind.  If you haven't listened to their work, this is a great set of singles that will give you a sense of the band and who they are.  Nutshell is a great cover.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|this has helped me to organize notes when I'm away from my office and to keep a grocery list going when I haven't got anything to write on.  I find taking my kindle to the grocery store a little cumbersome.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Amazing.  Loved it and the story sets up the original perfectly. Highly recommend this for adults and children. A Plus.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good interesting game=) nice way to spend time while waiting for my name to be called at the doctor's office!Lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my love of horses  was crushed when i fell of my horse and fractured my spine in 14 places. after i healed  i still loved horses but im to afraid to ride them. i love this app. great for all ages of hores lovers all over the world!!!! thank you My Horse.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game gives just enough of a challenge to keep me playing but not enough to make me want to give up and quit.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Bought this for my Granddaughter, she loves it, spends hours flitting around, would recommend for something to keep the kids distracted if your doing something.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This isn't a very good game to play. It gets easy after a hard level. I wouldn't recomed this game to any one. Sure it fills in time of your day but, all in all, it just plain boring. This game is also hard to make fun. This game just isn't fun, at all!
1416550550|3.0|This novel is the story of three main characters, Eliza, Nell, and Cassandra(Cassie)and their inter-generational relationships.  It is a mystery of heritage.  There is often a \\"Cassie\\" in wasp melodramas even if the name is rarely given in real life.  There are no Melissas, Susans, or Jennifers here.  About 2/3rds of the way through the novel I anticipated the ending.  Who were Nell's parents?  Why was she left alone on a ship from England bound for Australia.  Because the author created a main character who chose to emigrate to Australia, I knew the author must be Australian without looking up her bio. While most Europeans of the era were intent on emigrating to America, this one was only interested in Australia. Yes she created a plausible reason.  Eliza heard talk of a town in Australia to which her maid's brother and his family had emigrated with success.  Still given the plot line and the fact that Nathaniel was from the U.S. and had extended family there, the U.S. would have been a more logical destination.  This book is a step up from the bodice riper ladies novels.  In fact there is very little sex in the novel.  Still it is ladies clap trap melodrama nonetheless.  There are extensive descriptions of Nell's house in Paddington and how it was situated on the street.  Though she is good at description, this is where a diagram would have been helpful.  Even with her pages and pages of description of the relationship of the cliff cottage and Blackhurst, I still could not get a mental picture.  The cottage was only accessible from the main house through a lengthy and confusing maze garden.  The Cliff cottage with its walled garden and secret gates and doors remained a secret for me.  It would have been far better to have a diagram of the estate with the Cliff cottage and the maze garden.  A diagram of the walled cottage and its gardens would have been most helpful as well. This author can turn a phrase.  If she can get away from these fairy tales for adults thenmaybe she could write a good novel.  She should spend a year in the U.S. especially in NYC where she could glean the spiciness of ethnicity. This story misses out on all the richness we have when the novel includes ethnicity.  The Secret Garden can't hold a candle to Cutting For Stone or The Kite Runner.  There are too many freckled red heads, too many sandy haired adults, and too many fair skinned brunettes.  The characters are multi-dimensional so I know this author has it in her to write something other than ladies melodrama. Further, she weaves stories within her story.  She includes Eliza's published fairy tales in appropriate places in the story. It was a clever and effective literary technique. She alternated in her story between three time periods, Eliza's story, Nell's story and Cassandra's story.  So there are flashbacks.  This is hard enough to do with two time periods, but this author has conquered using three. I had no trouble reading or finishing this, because I wanted the answer to the mystery. It's just that after reading it I felt \\"So What!\\"  It is no big deal. Come to the U.S. Kate and experience the spiciness of life that exists outside the English wasp heritage.  You might find a worthwhile subject to write about.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|The only thing good about this game is my sister had a blast making the girls hair go straight up. The horrible. I locked me out of the game. I can't get it to work. It always says,&ldquo; You need to download again&ldquo;. I did and it said the same thing. Uuuuuuuuuugggggggggg. Another thing why the scrap do I have to buy EVERYTHING!? It is sooooooo frustrating!!!! I'm not joking. Don't listen to the first reviews. This game is a rip-off.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|I actually jumped during some scenes. The screen play of this is the scariest and most terrifying. Definitely worth watching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Me and my two friends are game producers ourselves, and we have played so many games it is almost ridiculous. Of all the games I have played, Minecraft stands out as an original idea, an example of five star gameplay, and the innovation funnel for anyone on Earth with an imagination and at least one hand. As a Kindle Fire HD user, I can be a little bummed when an update is late, but honestly, it isn't two weeks of me stomping around, writing bad reviews, and steaming out my ears. One risk of getting a product made mostly for shopping and reading is that the app store may do things such as wait for the less buggy update to be released. In all truth, amazon is doing you a favor by keeping your device from having crash problems. The game developers deserve five stars for this game, and that's what they get.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|It does not fit very well. You have to adjust it several times and it still won't charge the kindle. I am frustrated by the fact that the only seller of the kindle does not have the right parts for it.

B000ICXQGK|5.0|It is a movie for your mind and your senses, lush, vivid, and an emotional roller coaster that will leave you wanting to ride it again. It's simply a beautiful movie, in every sense of the word.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Get way to spend free time. Fun and addicting game.I am a fan of civilization so this is kinda like it. But fun in its own way.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Did not realize the connection speed of my movie would be so poor. Could not enjoy the special effects, color or the plot.  Will not be able to view movies on my TV thru Amazon, what a disappointment. Red box has the advantage to this problem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not sure why I'm bothering to write this review since the verdict is in on this title, but here goes anyway.  Anytime I buy a book I go straight to the negative reviews.  Not only are they more interesting, I like to see how someone's opinion could be so different from mine.  I read several of the one and two star reviews and quite honestly, they have a point. Some of the dialog is a bit cliched, some of the scenes a bit manipulative. But I loved this novel anyway.  In fact, I wouldn't even put it in the category of young adult were it not for the teenage characters within it.<br /><br />I've often heard the Hunger Games compared to the Japanese film called Battle Royale. Eh, yes and no.  Quite obviously there are dead-on similarities, but thematically I would put the Hunger Games head and shoulders above Battle.  The Japanese film doesn't have the strong POV character found in Katniss. It doesn't have the emotionally impact found in the demise of some important characters.  In fact, beyond premise, I can barely compare the two works.<br /><br />The only thing I found weak about the book (and even that is a bit strong) was the first person, present tense narrative.  It took me a good two chapters before I got in the groove.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet but that's on my list. In the meantime, I can easily recommend this title to anyone young adult or adult.  It is bound to become an SF classic. If it isn't considered so already.
B005F3GMAO|4.0|Good read.<br />An insight into the background of the building of the virgin empire. I would happily read more of Richards books
B0058W74UY|1.0|Couldn't figure out how to open files with it. No instructions with the ap that I could follow. Very confusing.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I loved the movies had to have the soundtrack,  couldn't find it in stores. So I went on line to get it.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book is a series of short interviews that jump around and give you individual views of the war. Not sure if a more structured format would have been easier to follow. Hope the movie isn't like this!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I loved the movies, and had  to have the sound track,  couldn't find them in any store so I went on line  to get them,
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Love the sound of this band. Its got an old-timey rock and roll sound, but it's definetly up-to-date with modern 'techno' sounds. I cant get enough of it; it's on repeat all day.

Thank you Adams family!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I've loved Burroughs' stories ever since I discovered them when I was in high school.  Still read them.  No, the film is not a literal adaptation of the books, but it's great.  The director respects the material, and the cast and scenery were spot on.  Everyone I know who has seen this film, young and old, has enjoyed it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|lots of action, some great lines delivered well. an enjoyable way to pass 2 hours and twenty two minutes of your life
1781162646|5.0|Although Stephen King is an excellent writer, I do not read much of his bloodier &#34;horror&#34; stories, because I do not care much for that genre.  However, I do appreciate the  'hard-boiled' school of detective fiction (Dashiell Hammett being the golden standard), and I actually ordered this book because the cover led me to think that is what Mr King was aiming at.  The story itself is something different: a sweet, honorable young man and his coming of age story; a glimpse into a world behind the curtains of carnivals and amusement parks that most of us do not see; a bit of wonder and sadness; and I will not say more because I do not want to be a spoiler. I would have liked an e-book version, because it is easier for me to hold a kindle than a physical book.  It is a good book, well worth reading.
B005DC68NI|4.0|David Gaughran's excellent reference on digital publishing lays out possible strategies, skills and success stories for those who ponder self publishing. There's great resources and 33  authors who inspire with their own experience.  Had this been a print book, I believe that formatting the author stories in side bars or other manners would been more effective. Listing the author stories at the end of the book tended to bury them, especially with the large number. Nonetheless, a fantastic resource.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A simple, fun room escape game. Having never played one, I thought I would give this one a try and am pretty happy with it.
B000A7DVR2|2.0|I recall not liking this movie the first time I saw it 10 years ago. I gave it another shot tonight since so many people quote from it. I still don't like it.<br /><br />So many problems just from a scriptwriting perspective: the unnecessary voiceover at the start, telling us The Dude is nobody worthy of your time or attention. The lack of character growth of anyone in the movie. The convoluted kidnapping plot could have been used more, but wasn't. There were completely unnecessary fluff in the movie too, like the PI in the beetle. Just watch the first few scenes. Do you like any of the characters? Do you have any reason to watch it? No.<br /><br />I'm amazed that so many name actors were in this. I wonder if a big truck of money was involved.
B00129H7VS|4.0|I liked it, but my wife did not. We had watched the Pacific and loved it. The wife felt dissappointed in the Band of Brothers after watching the Pacific.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The puzzles were logical and believable. Just the right amount of difficulty. I look forward to more rooms.

B000WN60NG|4.0|Good movie. Not historically accurate, mind you, and a little hokey in places, but it was a good night's entertainment.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Sharp Objects is a Psychological Suspense novel. It's not a Murder Mystery (though it looks sort of like one, though any avid mystery reader can figure out Whodunit halfway through the book) and it's not a Crime Novel in the sense of these CSI-wannabe or serial killer books that are popular. No, this is most specifically a psychological exploration of the character, Camille Preaker. The suspense aspect comes from something other than the \\"crime\\" in the book.<br /><br />I don't think it's any secret that the main character, Camille Preaker, is a \\"cutter\\" and that the real suspense--the real sense of tension and suspense in this story comes not from the discovery of the dead girls, or the eventual revelation of the murderer...but, rather, in the cringe-worthy anticipation of whether or not she will show her lover(s) the extent of her cutting, the map of scars on her body that reveal the history of her psychosis. I recall reading the book and being literally on the edge of my seat thinking \\"Oh my god, she's going to show him! She's going to show him her scars!\\" and then something happens and she doesn't. And then I got back to biting my nails again.<br /><br />For you see, Camille remains covered up from head to toe most of the time throughout the book--covered up literally and figuratively--as she hides her emotions upon layers and layers of guilt and self-hate, just like she hides her physical scars upon layers and layers of clothing. And for her to reveal the intimacy of her scars--again, both physical and emotional--is the true crux of the story and what ultimately gives it its disturbing and audacious power.<br /><br />If you are a crime buff, then look elsewhere. If you are a murder mystery aficionado, I think you will be disappointed. But if you are looking for something altogether different, something that verges on the wonderfully disturbing ritualistic dance with a character's dangerous psychosis, and riding on the roller coaster of her despair...then this is the book for you.the book for you.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|The different scenarios are pretty fun for this temple run type of game. I find that I spend too much time playing this.....which is really not a bad thing; that is if you didn't have work to do and books to read : )
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. IT needs more rooms, not enough floors game ends too quickly.  Can not stop playing. Everyone should play.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I had no idea what to expect from this book. I've heard so much praise about it I just went for it. It was very good but hard for me, at times, for me to get over the homosexual tones and general language. I enjoyed Lord Henry and many of his quotes are my highlighted notes. I found it enjoyable and many times odd.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the versitility of this app. It is very user friendly and a great way to use up some extra time. I wish that you were able to continue progress between Kindle Fire and Phone, but I have it for both any ways! I love this app!.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|So, I'll admit I've never seen the original Evil Dead, but after seeing the remake, it's definitely at the top of my \\"to do\\" list. Having said that, I think I can still say that this is a good movie.<br /><br />Evil Dead doesn't really have many scares, so if you're looking to be frightened, this isn't really the movie for that. Most of the more horrifying scenes are prededed by a door slamming by itself, so you know what to expect. Instead of evoking fear, this movie is more about grossing out the viewer and making him/her cringe. Personally, I enjoy a good amount of blood and gore, as long as the movie does'nt rely on that alone.<br /><br />I can't compare the plot of this movie to the original, but I think the plot was good enough. There were never any moments when I was confused as to what happened. Mostly, I was just exasperated with David's stupidity. Duct tape is not the cure for amputated limbs!<br /><br />All in all, this was a solid movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the pinterest app for Kindle Fire. It is easier to use than the full site found online. The new pinning techniques are very user friendly. I love being able ot access the same account from computer, phone and Kindle Fire.

B00003CWOL|5.0|i knew precisely what this was, saw it in the theater when it came out, and can basically enact the entire movie, worc-for-word, on my own.  When my VCR finally gave up the ghost, I realized I COULD NOT LIVE without a copy of Dogma I could actually watch.  Questionable language (or no language, in the case of Silent Bob) and all.
0531169855|4.0|I actually ordered it for my girls teacher. They had a report on it and lost the original flimsy paperback provided by the school.

Thanks Amazon
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is fun.  some of the puzzles are challenging but fun trying to solve them.  recommend getting this game.
B003KGBISY|5.0|I've always loved this film for its sublime mix of entertainment, philosophy, action, wonderful writing, and brilliant acting, especially by Mifune (Yojimbo, Rashomon) and Shimura (Godzilla, Drunken Angel), who are both some of Japan's greatest actors. Unfortunately any DVD of this classic epic is lacking. Lacking in special features, lacking in aspect ratio, lacking in commentary, and until this divine Blu-ray box set came out, all versions were inferior to viewing on the cinema screen. (This point still being debatable, of course).<br /><br />The Criterion Collection has done a wonderful job with this set, and I think it is one of their best. It has these special features to boot:<br /><br />*New, restored high-definition digital transfer, with the original uncompressed monaural soundtrack and an optional DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition<br />*Two audio commentaries, one featuring film scholars David Desser, Joan Mellen, Stephen Prince, Tony Rayns, and Donald Richie, and the other Japanese film expert Michael Jeck<br />*Fifty-minute documentary on the making of Seven Samurai, created as part of the Toho Masterworks series Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create<br />*My Life in Cinema, a two-hour video conversation from 1993 between directors Akira Kurosawa and Nagisa Oshima<br />*Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences, a documentary looking at the samurai traditions and films that helped shape Kurosawa's masterpiece<br />*Theatrical trailers and teaser<br />*Gallery of rare posters, behind-the scenes photos, and production stills<br />*New and improved English subtitle translation<br />*PLUS: A booklet featuring essays by Kenneth Turan, Peter Cowie, Philip Kemp, Peggy Chiao, Alain Silver, Stuart Galbraith, Arthur Penn, and Sidney Lumet and an interview with Toshiro Mifune from 1993<br /><br />Wow. A lot. Oh and the film itself hasn't aged a day. It still looks as amazingly shot as I'm sure it did in 1954.<br /><br />This is without a doubt the only version of the film to buy.<br /><br />Wow. A lot. Oh and the film itself hasn't aged a day. It still looks as amazingly shot as I'm sure it did in 1954.<br /><br />Kurosawa crafted a masterwork, criterion helped people realize it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Great movie. So sad that Disney did so poorly with marketing. Best Sci-Fi ever!!!!!! Really hope that they make a part 2.  I have to go back to barsoom!
B009PJ1S5S|5.0|If you've ever found yourself in a situation like this story, you may enjoy this movie. Warning- one of the sexual scenes is disturbing although it doesn't get explicit.<br />There is an intervention, everyone is very calm, proper and I would have thought that there would be more yelling in this scene for the movie. There is a dark moody tone in this film but I still give it 5 stars since Thure Lindhardt is very good and the women in this movie are shown as strong intelligent people. Hope you enjoy it too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've really enjoyed this game. Just right ammount of difficulty. It's not just a time waster it is fun and challenging.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|As I said, it's an awesome movie if you love action & cgi. Reasonable acting, nice plot... Enjoyable tech! If these types of movies are your thing, you won't be disappointed.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great movie. Sadly, Disney failed to market it well. Great cast, story, & special effects. It is a must see!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|As a DC resident, I enjoyed the many references to the local landmarks as well as the historical references.  Good story!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is alot better than i thought it was, at first i didn't think that i would like it
B00CH26TL8|2.0|This game has the potential to be fun but they need to make some changes. As you progress through the levels, it gets so difficult that you just can't win. I just spent 3 days on one level. They need to make the stars easier to get and not take 2 spiders for every non successful shot, sometimes you just don't have a choice because of how the game sets up. It really likes to give you bubbles that you can't use to mess you up.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Read this book in a day. Very entertaining. Can't wait to read the final book. Fifty shades of grey look out

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|First, I'm a huge Disney fan and that's what drew me to this game.  Game is easy to pick up and play. The calming effect of the reef, fish and the colors is what I like about it the most. Game play is smooth on my kindle HD.  Absolutely ZERO bugs.  That's huge in itself!!<br />Young and old can design their own reefs with their own creativity.<br />You do have to be careful with the store. You can purchase items to help your game play and that can add up FAST!!!!!  Buying items in the store are NOT mandatory to play this game.  It will take you longer to advance with the game, so unless your in a rush you don't have to spend money to play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book after my 10 year old daughter suggested it. I finished it in one day. Wonder is truly captivating! I fell in love with the characters as they came alive to me.

B001JNNDAQ|4.0|Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider. Nice movie about this true story made in the '70's. I recommend it for your collection.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I was born in 1970, so I am hypersensitive to the slightest amount of showboating or disrespect of these songs.  100% of the problems here can be summed up in 2 words: Julianne Hough.  Her \\"American Idol-ish\\" singing extra notes and syllables is the exact opposite of straight ahead 1980's rock.  Everyone else tries to stay out of the way and keep songs, sets, and costumes central.  Tom Cruise is surprisingly effective as a lonely Iggy Pop type.  Now: which band do I feel has aged the best??? The Scorpions by a mile.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The artist speaks for this CD itself. If you enjoy Andrea Bocelli, I suggest adding this CD to your collection.
6305882592|5.0|Tons of modern indies have been influenced by the style and tone of this film.  The freakishly intelligent director Hal Ashby was very experimental, forward looking, and keenly aware of the times he was living in.  His use of Cat Stevens' music is particularly brilliant to suggest the playful friendship and examination of life decisions and priorities these 2 characters bring to life in each other.  I admit the ending is creepy and awkward but I couldn't imagine it any other way.
B0012DK4ZU|4.0|Saw this movie when it came out in 1978 and was interested in seeing it again. It is a good movie but is kind of corny and the acting is OK compared to movies made today. Funny how horror movies have changed.

B005D63ICI|4.0|Really good season until the last episode where the writers chose to end it rather strangely. Julia Stiles is a nice addition to the cast.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I read the book... loved it.  But now I find out the author is this huge anti-gay bigot.  Kinda wrecks the book for me.  Should the author's views, which aren't on display anywhere in the book, color your view of the book?  Probably not.  But it does.  Sorry, can't recommend giving this author any more money.  Don't buy the book.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|It's not the deepest movie, but it's fun to watch, especially on July 4th. Good humor from Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. A fun movie for the family, and a few thrills too!
B00338QENI|3.0|The author has put an amazing amount of her life into researching and writing this book.  I feel badly writing this negative review.  You really have to admire her.  She took nearly a decade or more to follow this story, gather the notes, deal with the crazy family members - all on her own dime.  Wow... I could never have done any of that.  Nobody else would have the tenacity to write this story.  At least not in this way.<br /><br />The result is a somewhat interesting story about the history of the HeLe cell line.  The most interesting part of the story comes when the author reviews the abysmal ethics of the doctors of the time.  Seriously you can really picture these mad scientist types grafting cancer cells into prisoners, injecting black men with syphilis, draining the CSF out of epileptic children to get a clearer xray of the brain.  Note to self:  Don't volunteer for any more medical research!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately the story is only a little bit interesting.  It's not a LOT interesting.  It's worth investing a few minutes reading a paragraph or two.  Maybe even a short magazine article.  Even though the book is well written and superbly researched it's just plain and simply a dull story.  Maybe read the book jacket or something.<br /><br />Ok... spoiler alert... just read this and forget the book:<br /><br />\\"Black lady gets cancer.  Mad scientist takes her cells.  Other mad scientists make a killing off the cell line.  Family finds out about it many years later and gets upset but gets no cash.  End of story.\\"<br /><br />There.. I just saved you hours and hours of your life.  Go out and enjoy them.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing Spider Solitaire, and so when I first played this app I fell in love. GO, SPIDER SOLITAIRE!!!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was reluctant to view this film as I have a 38 year old daughter that has struggled most of her life with rapid cycling bipolar. The writing the acting was incredible. I laughed, backed up portions and viewed again and ended up crying at the end. Hoping, just hoping that a happy ending is in sight for my daughter.<br /><br />This movie is one of the best I have seen in the last 20 years.Lets have more of these.
1250007208|5.0|I'm always on the look out for a great series book and this one hits the mark!  It's probably one of the best dystopian society type books I've read since the \\"Hunger Games\\" series.  And, is in fact somewhat more realistic in several aspects than any of the other dystopian society books I've read.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves fractured fairy tales and science fiction!
B003O86FMW|4.0|So need to find out what happens next! I stayed up and finished the book the day I started it!
B00AGKH45I|2.0|The CD's, DVD, all worked, fantastic packaging.  But the thing I wanted most was the vinyl, as soon I played it, it skipped. Side A, two songs skipped, side B all but 3 songs skipped.  What a disappointment. Amazon was more than accommodating in replacing not one but 3 times.  Each one played the same.  I even played a few other new records I had just to make sure it wasn't my needle on my record player.  Was very sad to to have to give up and return for a refund.  DON'T BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO PLAY THE VINYL.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Haven't played around with various features much yet so I will update this posting when I get there...<br /><br />played easy..moderate levels. The game is fun, intuitive and works well.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I enjoyed all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey. Please hurry up with a 4th season. The story line was good & I enjoyed it.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Doesn't do more than taking a picture, converting to a format, and then offloading to other apps for storing it. Would like to see things like OCR, categorization. that will make this app really useful.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I'm disappointed this app is not much better than the free version.  Some of the information is not what I am interested in.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|The early Reacher novels have a charm of their own when you read them at the end of the sequence.  The plots are so different and yet quite believable.
B0081336FO|5.0|I wish they'd make some more episodes.  Amazon Prime is the only way to got!! IMO  Can't beat watching for Free!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book. It teaches los of life lessons and really makes you think (in a good way).
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|As a long-time A's fan, this movie was amazing.  Even if you aren't a long-time A's fan, the acting is terrific, the pace is good and the plot is lovely.  Wish there were more movies with lots of action but devoid of violence.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|It starts out a little slow but about 30 minutes in really start to get interesting. However it seems to be a really long movie but it draws you in and you hate to see it end.
1781162646|5.0|Fast shipping & in PERFECT condition. It was in better condition than described. I'm a Stephen King fan & Mr. King does not disappoint!!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Great I love the movie. The cast dues a great job bringing the movie to life. I hope that there will be another.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|If you ever want to watch the movie, &#34;The Wrath of Kahn,&#34; I highly recommend that you watch the episode &#34;Space Seed&#34; first. It sets the stage, and helps you better understand the character's motivation.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|entertaining, keeps me from going bored and makes the mind start working and keeps me young. I would suggest this game to my friends but would rather not be required to rate the game just to keep playing
B0000683DH|5.0|So well done, this movie picks up where the television Star Trek episode, The Space Seed, left off. Well worth the watch.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story slow and simple. Did not have a good beginning and it had a lousy ending. I am sorry I spent the money to read this book
0140544518|5.0|What would a story be like if we heard it retold from the &#34;villain's&#34; point of view? This book answers that question, and makes the children giggle with it's absurdity. Fun book!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I am addicted to BB. I play everyday. I wish it was easier to make the coins last longer. Whenever you purchase the credits it doesn't seem that there are enough credits to play. Sometimes it will kick me out of a room and not give me my point's I deserve
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is great i recommend it. she did a great job writing this book. if you haven't read it you should.
B000089RV6|5.0|Classic....what more can one say!....
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is more challenging than the other mystery games I have found. It is very fun, and very difficult.  Want more!!!  Can't wait for the next chapters. Wish it was here now.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Came early and have had it on my Ipod to get that early morning kick start!.... will be a repeat customer for sure!  Exactly as described! Thank you!
B00280LYIC|5.0|What a fun story. I love that it is entertaining as well as educational for younger readers. I highly recommend it for a child in your life.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey is a high energy extremely talented artist. I would recommend this CD to anyone no matter what kind of music you like. Her violin music is not your typical cat scratch you sometimes hear. she is an upbeat pop violinist. I am really glad I got the cd.. Was worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome because you get to collect and purchase items.me and my sister can play without worrying about the language.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Easy, no hassle notepad to write lists or make other notes on your digital devices. I like the auto save feature which makes it even quicker and easier to use.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Really great game! Its my first time to play it. However, it really surprises me!<br />The premium pack do worth it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|If you play Words with Friends, crosswords or other word games on a digital device, this is great too have.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr Hosseini has the great quality of writing a story with different story lines throughout several decades and intertwine them into a cohesive narration that makes you say WOW.<br />His narrative is superb, the description of the countryside takes you literally to the various places. you feel you are walking the sandy roads and admiring the beautiful mountains.  I have nothing but praise for this magnificent book
B007MDB71O|5.0|Loved the movie. Saw it on opening night with my entire family. I loved it so much, I bought the DVD the day it was released. I certainly hope that despite their mishandling of the marketting of this film that Disney doesnt overlook the potential gold mine they are sitting on. Edgar Rice Burroughs was a very prolific sci-fi adventure story-telling master. His work has been strip mined for years, its time the masters' stories were brought to the big screen. A great start would be John Carter of Mars II!!!!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Not exactly the same quality all the film, good enough though!The package could have been nicer, its too plain simple.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book was well written and informative on two subjects: the life and work of Nikola Tesla and also how a genius becomes a genius.  I was pleasantly surprised by the well conceived argument that it is not only innate ability but a combination of many factors such as work ethic, single-mindedness, and imagination that creates those rare few that we come to think of as geniuses.  It is well worth your time if you're are interested in a synopsis on Teams or how genius like his is created.
B004XUMRBI|5.0|I agree with many reviewers that this is Joss Whedon's finest work. It's intelligent, nuanced, unpredictable and poetic. The dialogue is remarkable - absolutely the finest writing of characters. The pace of the show is like drinking in a novella - great action fixes, but the balance of the crew's down time takes us into their world like no other show has been able to replicate. It's a must see, and it will make you wish there were shows like this again.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Bought this thinking kanye would deliver. It failed. But on a side note this works great to level my table
B008JEJLVS|2.0|Extremely wide fit, even with heavy socks.  I'm a normal size M and never had this problem before. Had to return.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an true love story, can't wait to read book#2. I hope it's as good as this one!!!! Great book
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Husband &amp; I love these kind of games, all of us worked on it,Not too hard but NOT too easy! Can't wait for new games!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|An incredible and very touching true story about how strong and tenacious the human spirit is and how courageous this family was in the face of extreme adversity through their love for one and other.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the different setups and the ability to replay the same deal as many times as you wish to play it.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Fine performances by Cooper and Lawrence.  The shouting scenes wore me down a bit and the crude language was way overdone.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|It's a great thing to have a really nice vinyl pressing of my favourite soundtrack of all time. Now if only Vangelis would release a complete score, I'll buy that in every format available.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the third book of the trilogy very much.  While this might be young adult fiction, I found it to be far above the usual teen angst and fantasy of that &#34;other&#34; made-into-blockbuster-movies series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Played it on my phone and loved it, and up until now there had only been cheap knock offs so i was pretty happy to see the legit app
B003F3NE1Q|2.0|Love the series but my last disc came in so scratched that I can't watch 2 of the episodes without it skipping like crazy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is a smaller version of the Pc minecraft the game will get a new update about<br />every five months or so but this is because mojang is also working on the Ps and console games.<br /><br />pocket edition is a fun way to pass time the controls are simple and if you don't like the default layout you can switch to split touch controls there are a lot of blocks but they are missing a lot of blocks that<br />are in the Pc version.<br />Ps. it does have survival mode
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|if you have a kindle I wouldn't recomend this app. its difficult to use and I definitely had compatability issues.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Right now I don't have much space because of this game and the only games I have on my kindle fire are this and minecraft pocket edition both are really good but if u don't want to loose all of ur space do not get or u can delete game when not in use and log back in later after u create an account and download the other games u want from the cloud later.
0385751532|5.0|Heartbreaking story reversing the roles of a German boy's demise instead of the Jewish boy in the concentration camp,  A must read and try to find the movie on TV  Its a tear jerker.  My 47 year old son even cried.
0446547603|3.0|Safe Haven - I enjoyed the book but found that the writing style was different to other books  I had read by this author. (Fast and to the point as in Dear John).<br /><br />* It seemed as though there was a lot of build up information about the characters.<br />* I found it hard to believe that the main character would break down and share her deep personal info with her neighbor.  I realize the info needed to be shared for the flow of the story but somehow could have been more believable,<br />* This was one of the N. Sparks-'s bouoks in which the final ending was what you hoped it would be - there was a lot of exccited reading to get there.
B0002HZLWI|4.0|The quality of the wood and the variety of the pieces is great, but I think that for the price that these cost, I expected slightly larger sized blocks. Also, I was a bit disappointed to find some nicks/dents on the edges of many of the long block pieces, and one long piece had one corner that was a bit cut off (seems the block was cut from an imperfect/incomplete piece of wood). I seriously considered sending it back and buying it again, but in the end did not have enough time as I was leaving for a trip. Would buy again but, again, for the price, expected higher quality control from Haba (am putting the responsibility on HABA, not the seller).<br /><br />My 19 month old loves them from time to time and has learned a new word while playing with this toy--\\"tall!\\"<br /><br />Edit: March 12, 2014 - Wow, I see the price jumped up from $114 to $160... not sure if it is worth THAT price, plus the $20 shipping... I did a quick search online and found other retailers selling this set for the original $114 price, so look elsewhere to buy this!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Bad not<br />a good book do not read this book it was a horrible bad book so the people who made this book needs to rewrite this book
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was suppose to be a trilogy and now there is going to be another book (or two).  I know the release date for this book was moved, but it is obvious the writer was rushed in the end to deliver a product.  I enjoyed the Crossfire series much better than the Fifty series, but now, I've been left hanging and very disappointed.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|The game would be awsome if it wasn't for all the glitches. Very often you will get a game over even though you have pleanty of shots left. Another glitch is I have finished the level and it will not end making you keep on firing ammo even tjough you are done.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Really fun. Let's build your own park thing and you can get so many dinosaurs and other things. Only bad is, some of them are expensive. Good game overall
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Well the game is crazy fun. There's nothing wrong with the fun factor in this game. The amazing graphics and dark scenery make you feel as if you're in the game. Also the game doesn't ask you for coins like the other free games on the market. You can be 100% fine playing the game without money.<br /><br />Then you play for a while. This may be just happening to me but I experience lots of game crashes and bugs when playing. 50% of the time the game crashes when booting up. The game also crashes about 25% of the time during a run. Last but mot least there's a bug that occurs once in a while where the tilt controller don't work. As far as I know my kindle is in near perfect condition but it could be me or the game.<br /><br />All in all this is an A+ if it works but for me it doesn't so I'm only giving it four stars.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I rather enjoyed this series. It was heartbreaking at points and completely enthralling. Will definitely be returning to the story many more times.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|wish there were more rooms to break out of! fun game! definitely interesting and entertaining. I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun game that gets you thinking.
B000JFDBXO|5.0|Awesome Marvel movie...a must see. All the great Xmen in one movie. Angel is here!  Ready for the next installment... Don't forget to watch after the credits for the usual Marvel surprise!!!
B008EKMB82|3.0|The book started with a whiny self-centered teenager, then it got really good in the middle, and then the ending was just stupid and ridiculous. If there had more more middle and less beginning and ending I would have given it a solid 4 stars and maybe even 5 stars because it was turning into one of those books that stick with you long after you've finished it. The beginning of the book, I would have been able to overlook because it seemed that Nao was changing and evolving through the book and that the reader was also being challenged to do the same....but the ending of the book just took all that spectacular reflection and introspection aspect that had been building and squashed it, pulverized it, and killed it. Real life isn't tied up with pretty little bows and all questions don't need an answer, especially if they are of the campy sci-fi/fantasy sort. So, I sort of liked this book but am also disappointed with it. Sigh....yeah.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME REPRESENTS PEOPLES RUNNING EXPERIENCE WHICH IS ONLY IN ALARMINGLY<br />BRILLIANT OBJECT AND IT IS A VERY LONG TIME SINCE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH A VERY GOOD FOR SCHOOL LIFE GAME
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I love Jessica Chastain, she's good in everything she acts in.  This surprised me as I went in with low expectations.  The CGI is kind of hokey and unbelievable...the ending is heartbreaking...I actually choked up at it.<br /><br />I think it's a solid movie with a good concept and worth seeing.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Before but now it's just a marketing tool. I deleted it because of that. Looking for a new weather app to use
B00DGN51O8|1.0|I couldn't enjoy watching this movie. It kept stalling all the time. I received an e-mail stating that your department recognize the problem and that I was going ot get a refund but never got it. Instead I got charge twice for it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Loaded it worked fine first time. Hasn't worked since.  Second app that disappointed me . The best I've found is radar express. No ads not a bunch of needless trash on the screen just weather
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book will take you into a fantasy world. It will keep you guessing and you won't be able to put it down.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app for EVERYTHING. I use it for grocery lists and even to keep track of the money i spend. I highly recommend this app for everyone. I also like the fact that you can personalize it by making it different colors. BEST NOTE APP EVER
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got this on a whim, and it couldn't have been more fortunate. The world he's created is fascinating, and the characters are varied and rounded. That this book is self published is even more reason to buy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My niece loves this game! Her mom and have both caughht ourselves playing at times. Your kids will love it!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Really good work from Lee Child. Just fantastic with his knowledge of war tactics and his detailed descriptions of Reacher.
0380789035|3.0|I don't think anyone would argue the concept of old/new gods and their human manifestations is pretty intriguing. I guess for me I just couldn't really relate to the main character, Shadow. Also, there is nothing going on in a large portion of the book, just the main character living a seemingly normal life. Lastly, some of it just got so weird that I just got burnt out to some degree. I think the upcoming HBO series will be better.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|Walking With Dinosaurs 3D The Movie is coming out in December 2013 and this guy is the featured dinosaur. So this Papo figure is going to be a must have. My only complaint is that the colors could have been a little more vibrant. Papo tends to still be going with the drab grays, browns, and greens on all of their dinosaurs. Nice pose. A good get for any collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like the best game I've never played before and I'm hoping that could play with my friends on Facebook
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can not belive it just ended. I can not wait till the next one to come out. you will not be disapponted with the crossfire serise.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Like the group coldplay and most of their music. This album was very good and many choices to listen too for the money.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was so much better than I expected.  It was much more than just a zombie read.  I enjoyed the speculation about modern humanity in such a desperate situation.  Highly recommend!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|This is the sort of story that stays with you and makes you slow your journey through it to prolong the pleasure. Ifemelu and Obinze make you want to cheer their authenticity and their knowing, assessments of the worlds they inhabit and the people who inhabit those worlds. I can't wait for Ms Adichie's next offering. Americanah is a book that I look forward to returning to and making new discoveries.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed the character development and the story. I couldn't wait to finish it and, when I did,<br />I didn't want it to be over.
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|Back in the day, it was the first DVD I bought with my new DVD player when I was phasing out my video player, the one that used to look like an 8-track tape player ... memba those?<br /><br />Anyhoo ... so when I saw this, I knew it had to come into my collection where I would never have to worry about losing a DVD or a broken DVD player ever again.<br /><br />Miss you Whit. Love you Kev.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|tiss a great movie and arrived as it  said it would and great shape also was not used was new and that awesome.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great, follows the TV series fairly close.  I did learn a few things not reveled on TV.  Looking forward to book number two
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Would like to give it 0 stars.  Boring. Crash sequence silly and improbable.  Gratuitous nudity. Nothing against nudity, it just didn't forward the plot at all.  Naked woman getting dressed while Denzel mumbles into his phone. What?<br />My husband suggested we destroy the CD so no one else would be subjected to such a terrible movie.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Naked is about as far from a pre-packaged formulaic Hollywood offering as you'll ever get.  The two hour plus film requires your complete attention and it's doubtful that watching it once will be enough to fully comprehend the film.  I saw this movie at a theater when it first came out and was simply stunned by Thewlis' performance.  I remember reading interviews of him describing staying in his generally despicable state for months before and after the three month shooting.  Since then, I've revisited the film several times on cable and was pleased to see that Criterion produced a lovely to watch DVD.  I watched both the film and film with commentary back to back, almost a 5 hour commitment, but well worth it.  Commentary features director Leigh, Thewlis and Katrin Cartlidge, who played Sophie.  Well worth a look and I found the descriptions of making the film as well as developing the characters fascinating.  Interesting to go back and look at the initial reviews of the film and the love or hate it generated among both audience members and critics.  If you're looking for a challenging movie, look no further and buy this one.
B0091VTISO|3.0|Rather long and boring.  I would not watch it again.  Lots of blood and gore.  It could have moved along a little faster
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have always struggled to follow Bible reading plans, but the Chronological reading plan makes this effort a snap. You get reminders when you start to fall behind, and never lose your place.  Also, phone is almost always with me so no excuse for forgetting the Bible. A great app all around.
B004OBQDHK|1.0|This product although it stated it was new it never worked.  Is there a return policy?  When put in the dvd player it simply will not play.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I think it is pretty funny and sad to know that this type of show would not make it on TV today.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love it. It helps me fall asleep easily. I've tried other apps but this one is the best. I give it 5 stars
B007SOQBCM|2.0|first it could use a chat. second when you click on a game it shows about 10 of the 50 streams, I want to check out all of the streams for that game. and last, I want to search users, or be able to log in and see my channel and update stuff from kindle. not try to do on computer while streaming.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie was lively and inspiring.  I recommend for random afternoon viewing.  I found ordering this movie through Amazon to be easy and the picture quality very good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love the movie. It is very funny and i can not wait to see the second movie, Despicable Me 2.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Game works great!  Provides of lots of fun for kids and adults.  I don't play too often though if I had small kids I can see how this would be helpful in a waiting room or on a car ride.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This movie was not what I expected. Very disappointing compared to the other ones. The quality in the video was terrible!
0439023483|5.0|Great story.  Great writing.  This book flew through my family and friends.  We all loved this story.  Book arrived timely!
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Box was super cute - looks like Jeannie's bottle.  I have it sitting on my tv stand. and it looks awesome!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|If you've seen the Walle Movie, this is the pre-Walle era.  There are a couple curse words, but is still a good family movie.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|Very good and beautiful watch. For anyone who likes big watches, it's a good deal, for a good price. I recommend that watch.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I forgot how much cussing was evident and unnecessary until I watched this movie again.  This should be a PG-13 rated film just for the cussing.  It's a great movie with a good message for those who have never watched this.  This would be a better movie for preteens and above, who don't have tender ears.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun on a day off! My Wife got me into these kind of games and I find them to be the most compelling. Can't wait for new rooms on this game!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My grandson and I have had hours of fun with this app.  It's beautifully done and a great pastime for young and old.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is amazing . you can crossbreed and save animals and have our own zoo. it also has missions for those who are a bit bored
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The movie was good, The special effects were done well. The movie kept with the integrity of the comic book series
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Reading the third novel in the Crossfire series was addictive, obsessive and erotic very much like the relationship between Gideon and Eva. The third instalment is as good as the first two novels. The relationship between Eva and Gideon is on a more stable platform and Eva has matured considerably in her behaviour. Gideon the alpha male is as domineering, powerful and dangerous as ever. Cant wait for the next instalment!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I stayed up all night loved it I wish the story went on longer I loved the Yorkshire it sounds so funny
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Nothing like the book. Poor acting and didn't follow the book. If you read the book, you'll surely be disappointed.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|I kind of expected it, since their first 3 albums were so sensational. There are only 2 or 3 songs on here that \\"feel\\" like LadyA. My favorite song on here is Cant Stand The Rain. Most of the other songs fall short for me. They've always had a little pop sound to their music, but it was a mature pop sound, like in Just A Kiss or Need You Now. The pop sounding songs in this album have more of an immature pop sound, like in Downtown. And some of the songs just fall flat, like they were thrown on the album for the heck of it. I'm sure many people will love every song on here, but its not for me.
B001MSMULG|5.0|This is Silva's first in the Allon series, and it was compelling - so compelling that I read it in 24 hours! Can't wait to start the next!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great games for kids and adults. My 4 year old grandson plays it with me and we have a good time. It has helped him to learn to share. Also keeps my thinking sharp. Like the monthly changes to the game. Keeps it fresh.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it! u need to play. it makes me get anxious as it plays faster and faster. my kids like to play too.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Emily Griffin did it again!! Amazed by her stories. Wonderful book! Loving this series!! Moving on to the next book!
B003L77G2Y|4.0|This was the last season of this excellent series that I liked.  The character's stories and interactions were fantastic and the plot was still somewhat acceptable.  After this season and into Season 4 and the final few episodes, the mythology became so convoluted as to be almost indecipherable. No one who had not watched the first 3 seasons had a clue what was going on.  I watched it to the end but only because I needed to know how it would end.

B0000263YY|4.0|The technical aspect here first of all is it is noticeably better than the normal soundtrack but not as good, for example, as the digital recording of the soundtrack of &#34;Grease&#34;.<br />  Otherwise the songs are great and are an excellent draw to purchase this recording.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|this version .whilst good is just the basic app.there are better angry birds apps available.i would advise going for a more up to date version than this one

B001O1O71C|5.0|This is a very particular book ! I enjoyed it a lot I felt lots of emotion , from both characters it was both happy and sad. Yet I never saw anything like that happening and I would recommend this book. This book is definitely worth buying! I hope that if you do buy it you enjoy it as much as I did!!!  :)
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I could really identify with Barbra's character. ( course Streisand can do no wrong with me)! Very good movie! Get it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, especially young adults. Such a beautiful story of love that isn't cheesy but instead realistic. We need more books like this.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a very through & vivid examination of the causes, results & what it takes to stop evil that seems to always surface, every so often in the history of mankind. My parents & uncles went to help stop this evil, but were relcutant to talk about their part in it.<br /><br />After watching this series, one can understand why.
B003B02O0A|4.0|Classic Grisham! I re-read this book in preparation for the sequel expected to be released in the fall. There was much I had forgotten. There were times when I didn't think we would ever get to the trial but I am glad I plowed through that. Ready for the next book!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have to admit, from the get go, that this book isn't as...well rounded as his other two. Or maybe it's too well rounded. There are so many different people and so many different stories and things going on that you don't get the feeling if satisfaction from all of the stories. Like some of them are unfinished. I didn't get this longing from his other two books, those books were perfect. And although this one has some stories cut short, the stories it does portray are probably his best yet. It is a beautifully written book, and it draws you in, makes you cry, it is extremely relatable in many instances, and it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Unlike his other two books, though, I think this one needs a part 2, to further expound on some of the shorter stories and some of the other characters we meet and their lives.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have Just read Hopeless and Losing Hope consecutively, they are the first books I have had the pleasure to read by Colleen Hoover, and I an happy to admit they exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />In Hopeless you get the full story from Sky's point of view. This is a unique tale and I am really impressed with Colleen's writing style. It is a love story, but it touches on some really dark and unpleasant themes, and I have to say that the way they were dealt with, and the absolutely mesmerising way Colleen has written how everything then unfolds, made the book very hard to put down, in fact I read it in a day.<br /><br />Losing Hope tells the same story from Holders POV, and this is where I have to raise my hat to Colleen Hoover in total respect, for the humble and thoughtful way the book is written.<br /><br />Let me clarify, there have been quite a few books lately where they have either been told in alternating POV's, or an author has released a complete book of the same story told in an alternate POV, and I have to say I have found alot of them to be totally underwhelming, you don't gain anything new from them, and it almost feels like a little bit of a cop out when you are reading passages and passages of prose that is exactly the same as the original book.<br /><br />Not so with Losing Hope, although it follows the same storyline, this is wholly Holders story, it feels like a guys perspective, and I love the way his was given a way to express his emotions and feelings by writing letters. Men as you know don't generally sit around talking about their feelings, so you either get extremely lengthy inner monologues or the book is missing alot of information that you actually wanted to see. Holder is a pretty impressive guy, and you get to see the whole package in Losing Hope. The poor guy is dealing with a much as Sky in a really admirable way, and at no point did it feel like I was reading the same book again.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this series, and Colleen Hoover highly enough, I have already purchased the rest of her books, and cannot wait to immerse myself in another one of her stories very soon.n Hoover highly enough, I have already purchased the rest of her books, and cannot wait to immerse myself in another one of her stories very soon.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Gregory Porter can do no wrong.  I appreciate his blend of modern and classic.  It is refereshing to hear a younger voice in jazz.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I thought I already left a review on this cable.  You can't go wrong  as this is for my Kindle.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is a really great film. If you liked the original E.R. Burroughs series of books you'll love this movie.
B00992CF6W|4.0|yea this app is awesome needs a little work because sometimes the app crashes when I put armorial on then its gone
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Wonderful opera! All the head liners in this are amazing. Well scripted and enjoyable to watch. Glad we have added it to our collection.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|When I first got it, I didn't think is was gonna be any good. But my mind got changed really fast. Hubby &amp; I are in a constant competition to see who can beat who's score lol.
B009AMANBA|4.0|A good movie but not at all historically correct. It does show that politics have not changed at all over time.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Locked up and had to reinstall from cloud.  Lost everything I paid for (Necroa and Neurax viruses) and everything I had earned (DNA, cheats).  Developer seems  unable to help.  Very frustrating.  Would rate higher, but after losing everything and not getting it back I cannot rate any higher.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|A good movie but is slow and not intuitive to start. It all comes together at the end. Not on par with some of the other future possibility films but a good show.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Really enjoyed.  First game I've played like this. Recommended highly.  Great graphics, sound, concept.  Fun way to pass the time.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Nothing more to say! It is always good to watch a Die hard movie and this one is no exception
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game.  Great mindless fun.  I find it strangely relaxing (not crazy about the music, but I play with the volume off).
0802136834|3.0|I thought this was an excellently researched book and very well done.  My only complaint is that the author would repeatedly make a statement about what ended up happening and then you spent thirty plus pages getting to it (spoilers).  I would have much preferred having to read the pages to get to the end result.  I realize this is history not fiction, but I highly doubt most people know every detail (or even many) of the subject matter.  It would be one thing if this only happened once, but it is part of the writers style throughout the book.  Without that, this book is five star in my opinion.  Unfortunately it markedly impacted my enjoyment of the book.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I do not think you can beat the price and I think the quality is acceptable. I use these in my blood glucose tester and they have a good life span. I recommend them.

B001EBWINQ|2.0|Though Casablanca is a classic, it does not even compare to other classics from the same era, like the maltese falcon.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Big fan of SCI-FY and love the movie. I hope that Disney makes a sequel!<br /><br />Remember people we watch movies to be entertained and to be enlightened I read a book!
B005LAIISA|5.0|Bought for my children! They have seen them all and will probably love this one to. I would tell everyone to own this dvd. Plus it came in excellent condition and came extra quick!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Oops, fell asleep! Great app, Lots of great sounds to listen to. Works great on the first generation Kindle Fire.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Read the book after you see this film SK did an excellent job with this film.  It's twisted and I would not recommend it to any one under 13 or anyone who still sleeps with a night lite
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|It works on my tablet which can always use something to clean it up since most of them are so vulnerable to anything. I feel safer with it on my tablet.
B003YCI1PM|4.0|I like this album a lot. Although the album doesn't flow together very well, there are very few fillers.<br />Round & Round (7/10): I don't like the bridge in this one, but it was the obvious first single choice.<br />A Year Without Rain (5/10): I don't really care for this song and don't understand the love for it, her vocals aren't good.<br />Rock God (8/10): Here's a track where her vocals shine, it's spunky with a lot of attitude.<br />Off The Chain (10/10): A career high for Selena, this song is dreamy & enticing while being irresistibly catchy.<br />Summer's Not Hot (8/10): The production on this track is a bit cheap-sounding, but the lyrics are campy and it's cute.<br />Intuition (8/10): I really like the instrumental for this song, but Eric Bellinger's part was unneeded.<br />Spotlight (5/10): Here's another filler track I could do without. It sounds like an unfinished demo.<br />Ghost of You (9/10): This song is really beautiful & you can hear the emotion in Selena's voice.<br />Sick of You (8/10): Very generic, but she makes it work and it's undeniably memorable.<br />Live Like There's No Tomorrow (9/10): This song has an amazing chorus and is very good for a soundtrack single tacked onto the end of a studio album.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this album 4.5 stars if I could. It has some lows but the highs are pretty great.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was shocking and left you wanting more it was so good that I read it 2 more times just for fun
B009EP3DJM|1.0|Well, after two years of hype and Ke$ha promising to 'change pop music', this is what we get. I used to be a huge Ke$ha fan, but this album turned me off of her completely. The only good songs are \\"Crazy Kids\\" and \\"Out Alive\\". This is typical generic radio fluff, except it's not good generic radio fluff like Animal was. She also threw in a couple of guitar strums this time to convince us that she's 'indie'. This album's lowest lows include \\"Dirty Love\\", a song where Ke$ha proves to us that she's a 'rockstar!', complete with a feature from a complete hasbeen, \\"Wherever You Are\\", a watered-down lullaby that shows us just how truly awful Ke$ha's vocals can be, and \\"C'Mon\\", a song that sounds like it came straight from 2008. It seems the general public agrees with me, since this album was one of the biggest musical bombs of 2012/2013. It's safe to say Ke$ha's career is done, which she genuinely deserves after releasing this generic, unlistenable wreck.
0451228375|5.0|This book (along with Pillars of The Earth) is a well woven tale. There are many story lines, but Follett ties them together excellently and despite so much going on, it isn't confusing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have a lot of games and I can't help but get so bored with them after a while. Before I got this game I would give up and listen to music when I got bored. Now I can just play this and I never get bored with it. This game is awesome and so realistic. Most of all I love how it is so much different than other horse care games.
B004SK1Q4M|5.0|This film has Angela Lansbury, Knights, Nazis, magic, and animated talking animals. It really doesn't get any better than this.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|the directions are very vague and there is no clues to help with solving the puzzles or even finding them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoyed this season, it was a big improvement over last season. The action was non-stop, and the plot twists kept you guessing.
0345529057|5.0|This is by far the most epic series I've read. If you're into romance, comedy and drama in any aspect buy this series.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, so I don't know how well the adaptation worked. The story is told in the form of intereviews with survivors from many different points of view. Maybe a few too many points of view, because it does drag a little towards the end.<br />You could easily interpolate world reaction to a flu pandemic and be a little better prepared. Of course, if the zombie apocalypse ever does occur...you'll know where to go.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|similar to 100 floors but the puzzles are more complex.  fun but much too short!  i guess for free, 10 levels is ok.  hope fore more real soon!
1891252089|5.0|Great pictures and alignment cues offering both the full posture and modifications for the first and second series.  A book is no substitute for taking classes at a studio though, especially if you are somewhat new to yoga.  It is a guide to be used during your home practice and as a reference to refer to with specific questions regarding the asanas.
1451627297|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm a big fan of Stephen King and in my opinion this book ranks in the upper third of other King books that I've read. The time travel aspect of the plot is very different than other time travel books, and when reading it, I felt like I was back in the days of my childhood, with an adult perspective.
0345529057|5.0|I just started watching the show and I knew I had to pick up the books to prep my self for season 4. I just started A Storm of Swords book 3 in the series after finishing Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings within a week and a half. Martin has created such a vast and rich fantasy world with complex characters and a in depth mythology. A definite must read.
B00005O3VC|5.0|The mayhem and mischief these guys encounter on their travels through medieval times is hilarious.  Classic lines (&#34;lets call it a draw&#34;) and recurring foibles keeps me in stitches every time I see it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game! Time killing and somewhat challenging. Definitely keeps you trying. I had problem with level 7, it took me ALL day... literally
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This was a great study on the reality of what it takes to become great or at the very least ...better at something.<br />I've sent copies to friends and family....every parent should read this...and every teacher.
0316228532|5.0|Acutely observed, and expressed with precision humour. J.K. Rowling has created a whole world of delicious dysfunction. I was utterly absorbed. I feel awed by the weight of attention she must have given to building plot and characterisation, and to the interweaving of the countless, complex elements of this story. I loved this book. It's a masterpiece.<br /><br />Natasha Holme<br />Author of 'Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder'

B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books!!  I really wish there were more. I will recommend and re-read often! I am going to look for more books by this author.
0385349831|5.0|This book gives insight and inspiration for dealing with all aspects of one's life.  An 'aha' moment erupts often as the book is read.
B0083Z614S|4.0|It is a story of love and strength, and goodness in the human spirit.  This book is written for all ages.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I definitely liked the other John Grisham book's better. This one wasn't very exciting as the others. There wasn't as much tension.
0920668372|5.0|I recommend this book to first time parents.  It's a great story that is suitable for both boys and girls.  I read it to my son whenever I have the chance at night.
1416972250|4.0|There are so many twists & turns in this installment of The Mortal Instruments series.  It's my favorite by far!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I saw the movie &#34;Howl's Moving Castle&#34; with my teenage daughters. The movie was good, the book is even better. I have a new favorite author. The story and the characters were a delight, can't wait to read more from this author.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Despicable Me is a fantastic movie that keeps you laughing. Steve Carell is a brilliant actor and the little girls and minions are so adorable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not hard enough to be frustrating but challenging enough to be fun. My 8 Year old plays it but needs help with some it like math puzzles. Its both fun and helps him use his brain. I sm pretty good st puzzles so its easy for me but still fun. Would love more levels.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have vision problems, and my Kindle let me adjust the font so that I could enjoy reading this book. I could hardly put it down I read it three days
B00AEBBA5E|3.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of The Score falls into the middle range of transfers I have seen.  It does provide increased detail over the DVD and little film grain.  But the color is a bit washed out--it would have benefitted from more saturation.  I adjusted the settings on my television, and that helped.  It does not matter all that much, however, because the visual elements of this movie are not the prime draw, but rather the plot.  The sound was fine.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it in my opinion, but only barely.
0142405809|5.0|The first half of the story reads like a journey or sea shanty for a snail and a whale.  With a &#34;sniff and a sigh&#34;. So cute.Later, the journey puts the whale in danger and the snail becomes an advocate to save the whale. His little voice is heard and children come running to save the whale.  A great book simply for the rhyming but also fun for older kids as a model of environmental activism.
B001TH16DS|5.0|As a lifelong Star Trek fan, I was eager to see the restored version of the original series.  It does not disappoint.  For a television show that was filmed almost fifty years ago, the details are sharp, colors are vibrant, and the sound is strong and clear.  There is very little film grain.  It is so much better than the DVD copies.<br /><br />One unfortunate side effect of the improved clarity, however, is that some of the special effects now call attention to themselves.  The bridge of the Enterprise is so evidently a set.  The alien landscapes look even more fake.  Alien costumes are evidently rubber.  You can now detect the makeup on Spock.  When characters engage in hand-to-hand combat, you can make out the faces of the stunt doubles, etc.  But at the end of the day, I didn't care.  I make allowances for that.  This is the best edition of the show that I have loved watching since my childhood.<br /><br />This version also has an option for improved special effects.  Many of the exterior shots of the Enterprise orbiting around planets and such did not hold up well with time.  So the top menu has an option to watch either the original special effects or digitally enhanced special effects.  Normally, I am purist.  But surprisingly I prefer the enhanced effects on this edition.  They are less jarring.<br /><br />The discs include some special features--interviews, home movies, and the like.  But I have not fully plumbed them yet, and so cannot comment on them.<br /><br />Watching these old episodes has given me a renewed appreciation for the general quality of the writing (there are a few dud episodes).  The three principal characters--Kirk, Spock and McCoy--are fantastic, and the interactions between them memorable.  Good dramatic tension, humor, etc.  You care about the characters.  The stories have held up well over time.  It is also fun to watch how this show anticipated later developments in technology.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan, and you are wondering whether this edition is worth the money, it is worth every cent.  You will not be disappointed.ring whether this edition is worth the money, it is worth every cent.  You will not be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Calling this an erotic novel is giving it far too much credit.  It's a teenage fantasy - and not a very imaginative one at that.

B00B8WXG9G|4.0|A great CD, make sure it is on all of your play lists.  This is really awesome music to listen too.  Paul Anka still has it.
B009GEDP26|5.0|The content of the shows is great; the plots are clever and the banter among all the cast is great.  The chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is off the charts.  However, the video feed is glitchy sometimes and the fast-forward/rewind is clunky and slow.

B003ELKNH2|5.0|Saw this movie in Waikiki in 1979 when it first came out. Finally got my own copy. I have watched this movie over 30 times. Note that the redux version has extra scenes that were not in the original movie. I personally do not like the extra scenes..for they seem to slow down the action of the movie.

B00650SSDU|1.0|Mind numbing.  The plot revealed in the name.  It's just crap dialog for the whole movie.  Nothing romantic or comedy about it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|We missed season 5.  Now we have a DVR and will not miss season 6.  But this was well worth it to purchase season 5 and &#34;catch up&#34; over the summer.  If you have never watched &#34;Castle,&#34;  we HIGHLY recommend it!  You won't regret it.  :-)
B00479SVBU|5.0|I read several reviews that mentioned song and folder sorting problems with the Soundfly AUX and I too experienced these problems. All of my folder and sort observations are for MP3s only and for SD cards only.<br /><br />The inability of the Soundfly AUX to do logical sorting of folders and songs was a big irritation until I discovered how the unit operates. The AUX does not have the same sophistication of a computer when it comes to how it displays the contents of an SD card. The main problem with the Soundfly is that it sorts its folders in the order in which they were copied to the SD card. For example, if you copy STEVE MILLER, FLEETWOOD MAC and BAD COMPANY folders to the unit in this order, this is the order in which they will appear in the folders list.<br /><br />The Soundfly AUX will not recognize a folder if it does not contain an MP3. For example, if you have a folder named SANTANA you can place other Santana folders under it, (Inner Secrets, Freedom, Abraxas etc.) but the SANTANA folder will not appear in the folder list, unless it has an MP3 in it. If you copy the entire SANTANA folder at one time, the Santana albums in the SANTANA folder will appear together in Z to A sort order.<br /><br />This was the quickest and easiest way for me to load songs to the SD card so that the Soundfly AUX can present them in a logical order. First, I made a folder on my computer called MUSIC. Then  I copied all of the music folders I wanted to put on the SD card so that they appeared as sub folders under the MUSIC folder. Some of the music folders (ROLLING STONES, BEATLES, EAGLES etc.) had sub folders. After all of the music folders were copied to the MUSIC folder I formatted the SD drive. Next, I copied the MUSIC folder onto the SD drive. The computer began to copy the folders in order from Z to A and this is how they appeared in the Soundfly AUX unit with one exception: All of the empty folders containing sub folders appeared at the bottom of the list with the sub folders in Z to A sort order.<br /><br />Here is an example of the order in which the following folders will appear in the AUX player when prepared and copied using the above method:<br /><br />TONY RICE<br />STEVE MILLER<br />ROD STEWART<br />PATSY CLINE<br />HUEY LEWIS<br />BOSTON<br />(SANTANA FOLDER, invisible when empty, with 5 sub folders.)<br />>SANTANA III<br />>SANTANA I<br />>INNER SECRETS<br />>FREEDOM<br />>ABRAXAS<br />(BEATLES invisible when empty, with 4 sub folders.)<br />>SGT. PEPPER<br />>RUBBER SOUL<br />>MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR<br />>ABBY ROAD<br /><br />Incidentally, even though the folders appear in Z to A sort order, the music titles contained in the folders appear in A to Z sort order, or in 00, 01, 02, 03 sort order.<br /><br />New folders and songs can be added to the SD card, but they will appear out of order in the AUX sort list. The last folders added to the SD card can be deleted without disturbing the folders added before them. However, if folders and/or songs are deleted from the middle of the card and new folders and/or songs fill in the empty space where the deleted files were, the AUX becomes confused and has problems performing logical sorts. At this point, some of the old and new folders may appear out of order and some of the songs may appear out of order in the folders. Therefore, loading the SD card is pretty much a one shot deal if sort order is desired.<br /><br />If I decide to delete the BOSTON folder and add BUDDY HOLLY, I need to first make this change on the MUSIC folder on my computer, format the SD card and copy the entire revised MUSIC folder onto the SD card. This is not convenient if you want to add and delete folders and songs without going through this process. But it is the only way that I have found to preserve the logical sort order of the files on the AUX SD card.<br /><br />Oh yeah, before I forget, Amazon will not let me write two reviews for the same product. Therefore, I have posted my review of the Soundfly AUX in the comments under this post.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />For simplicity, I have now decided to eliminate all folders that contain sub-folders. Not only does this strategy free up some folders that count toward the total maximum of 99 folders, it makes the sort order much easier to navigate. Here is how the folder list above looks after doing some re-naming:<br /><br />TONY RICE<br />STEVE MILLER<br />SANTANA III<br />SANTANA I<br />SANTANA INNER SECRETS<br />SANTANA FREEDOM<br />SANTANA ABRAXAS<br />ROD STEWART<br />PATSY CLINE<br />HUEY LEWIS<br />BOSTON<br />BEATLES SGT. PEPPER<br />BEATLES RUBBER SOUL<br />BEATLES MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR<br />BEATLES ABBY ROAD
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|This Nick Cave and Bad Seeds work is trully amazing! Jubilee street song is probably one of the best songs ever! I love this album, cant have enough of this!
B00457WZEI|5.0|So hard to read because of the continual sadness and heart break, but I am glad I did.  As always, better than the movie.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The message is really good, the movie is cute and fun, and it is interesting from start to finish. I really enjoyed watching this movie.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been gaining weight over the years.  Nothing worked to get it under control.  Then I found Intermittent Fasting.  This one small book summed up the methods, the scientific research, and real live menu examples; all in easy to understand English.  I a few short months, I lost the excess weight.  It was easy and I never felt deprived.  I am now maintaining my normal weight with little or no effort.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|The instructions are fine, but the camera on the Kindle is impractical.  I don't need a camera, but if you are going to put one on the Kindle it should be usable.  It is virtually impossible to point the camera in the right direction to get a decent picture, you should at leat have a virwfinder on it
0812984412|4.0|Technically this is a wonderful book.  The interwoven plot lines, the character development, the quirky character dialog; all make this an excellent book.  But that nebulous something that makes me care about the characters was missing for me.  I felt like I was watching people walk by in the airport instead of getting involved in their lives.  Many others rate this book very highly, so maybe it is just me.
B0094POVZM|5.0|Excellent movie and the acting was fantastic! Nicole Kidman was really great.  Good unexpected twist to the plot....definitely worth seeing!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having read Mr. Hosseini's first two books and finding them absolute page turners, I was a little disappointed with this book, but in fact, did enjoy it, just not as much as his first two.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Keeps you intertwined again. Couldn't put the book down. Cant wait for the sequel. If you love 50 shades of Grey You will love these.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Do not get if you want accuracy.  Liked old version very better!  Wish it had an option to stay in old version and not be forced to upgrade to what I feel is a worse version.
B000KADH2S|5.0|With the author's psychology background, it makes for an intriguing perspective on the mental life of a concentration camp prisoner. In contrast to societal values which emphasize pleasure seeking and instant gratification, Frankl analyzes the deeper issues that one must truly understand in order to be fully content.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|If you could imagine how Stanislavskiy directed Chekhov's Chaika (Seagul) and then project it on how Dustin Hoffman would transcribe this very Chekhov-like story...
B005HP2J66|5.0|Interesting, not what I expected but interesting. It's on it's way around my friends and they seem to like it too but then we're all weird. fondly, Jenny.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Simple game yet amazing! Thumbs up! I got it for my three year old but I find myself playing it a lot
159562015X|5.0|When I saw my top five, I wanted to cry.  I did not think this book was very accurate until the next time I had to work in a group setting.  However, it was right on.  It was really helpful to know other people's personalities and the group worked smoother than ever.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic \\"The Princess of Mars\\" John Carter is an imaginative adventure that begins with the title character in 19th century U.S. and ranges to the deserts of a populated Mars. It does require the suspension of disbelief that a 19th century novel, told from the perspective of 19th century knowledge, demands. With that in mind, I recommend this story for all ages.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Imagine if you took John Legend, Jimi Hendrix, and Bill Withers then combined them together. That would be one bad-assed singer and guitar player. Gary Clark Jr isin't that much of a bad ass, but he is close. It is hard to classify his album, as the music moves through genres from song to song.<br /><br />I have thoroughly enjoyed this album and the new one by Booker T.<br /><br />I would recommend both.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|they need more people to pick like the people from the movie like all the witches and China girl and finel
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should add minecarts and boat then there will be more people playing this game because it will be like the other game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun way to have a horse. Great for young girls to learn about the care of a horse and horseshows.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I got it for my sister and she loves it, there is a lot of great songs on it and she listens to it all the time, I think its one of his best Cds.
B000035P5E|5.0|This movie keeps you on the edge of you seat. The acting and story line are excellent. Frag the popcorn
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS A COOL GAME I REALLY LOVE IT BUT THE UPDATES ARE KINDA SLOW ON KINDLE FIRE HD  OTHER THAN THAT IT IS GOOD GAME NO AWESOME GAME
0071373586|2.0|I would not recommend this book for those looking for how to best position their small business in the minds of their customers. The book spends a lot of time citing very old examples of large corporations (GE, IBM...), as opposed to discussing specifics that a small business owner could apply to his or her business. This is the most disappointing book I've read this year and I truly feel I wasted my money and time reading it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A classic that gives hours of fun. Go against the clock and beat your time next round.<br />Hard to put down.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|The music is great but the packaging was uninspired and in today's digital world, you have to expect more! I went to the show at Pine Knob, a venue I've seen the Beach Boys at many times before. We'll never see another like the Beach Boys!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The best book i have read<br />I wish there was more of these kinds of books and i would like to know if its a true story
160774273X|5.0|I've been baking bread for more than 10 years and I finally feel like there is a definitive, reader-friendly book that brings it all together. Thank you!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very good not overly difficult but just challenging enough to keep your attention hope they make more levels and keep up the good work
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, makes you think.  Wish there were more levels to play.  Definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games.
B0026NBZEY|5.0|In her novel Affinity, Sarah Waters takes us to Victorian England. Exploring a dual system of oppression, the prison system and the social condition of women, Waters weaves a master multi-layered tale. Imprisoned for a seance gone terribly wrong, Selina Dawes sits festering in horrific conditions in a women's prison. Margaret Prior, recovering from a suicide attempt, tends to the women and their needs as charity. These two women's lives collide, changing both forever. Affinity is a tale of forbidden arts, forbidden love, and forbidden social rights. The story unfolds in dense, complex layers, leaving the reader questioning motivations, actions, and the reality of the supernatural. The prose is elegant, drawing us into a tangled web of ghosts, fear, and ever-increasing tension. Hints of madness creep around the edges in classic Gothic tradition and the uncertainty builds to a feverish pitch.<br /><br />If You Like: Henry James, Edgar Allan Poe<br /><br />Gothic Readers Book Club does not receive payment for reviews. All books are promotional copies.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Will watch again and again... Can't wait til I watch the next one, bet its much better then this one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think this is a pretty good game. Has an interesting story plot. Only thing is that it too a very long time to download. Other than that it is good.
B006M4F67A|3.0|This game would be a lot more exciting only if the tiles were a little larger.  I love playing any Mahjong game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Needs more levels other than that it is a good game not too hard but not to easy good to waste time
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I usually use the calculator on my phone, but there are times when I need to use one when I am using my phone.  So I went to Kindle Fire Store and purchased this one and it works great!
0307352153|5.0|Oh Lord, I loved this book. Full disclosure: lifetime INFP; which I've known since 1987. Happy with it; no plans to change or \\"develop the other half of myself.\\" (A psychologist friend tells me Jung intended the system to help you know what you needed to work on. After reading Quiet, the thought flashed across my mind: Jung's dead. Maybe he would have changed his thinking about needing to work on my weak side if he'd lived long enough.)<br /><br />I was encouraged to open a bio of Dale Carnegie after reading Quiet, and I think Cain does him a bit of a disservice. Yes, he's the key to the cult of personality. OTOH, he's also the reason we learned how to teach public speaking in a way that worked. I'm a fluent and skilled public speaker as a result of that course. Carnegie's system works. There's no contradiction between introversion and acquisition of a skill like public speaking.<br /><br />Funny, but while I'll defend Dale, I loved the rip on Harvard Business School.<br /><br />A few other quibbles from a note I made while reading:<br />>the habit of referring to content addressed in future chapters quickly became irritating.<br />>In the Collaboration / Creativity chapter, Cain dismisses those musicians training to be music teachers at the \\"elite Music Academy in West Berlin\\" as \\"the worst group.\\" Huh? Perhaps these people are the least skilled at musical performance. But by the time you've been accepted into the eMAinWB, you're hardly the \\"worst\\" in any musical comparison. p. 80, my copy) Sloppy choice of words.<br /><br />I think I will read Quiet again, and that is a rare behavior for me. I was encouraged by the chapter on creativity as a solo experience, having just struggled through Robinson's Out of Our Minds, which says creative people love collaboration. I couldn't finish that book. My creativity is a solo thing. I am encouraged to be reminded of \\"remote\\" and highly successful introverts; if \\"remote\\" and \\"introverted\\" aren't redundant (they are at least side-by-side).<br /><br />I can't find more to say that the other reviewers haven't already covered. A large % of the highly ranked reviews have been written by people who review a lot of books.<br /><br />Unfortunately, no designer credit is given in the pre-release copy of this book. It is a joy to hold and read the paper edition.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Not much to say about this adapter.<br />It does what its supposed to day in and day out.<br />Very happy with my purchase!
1609611543|5.0|My niece first told me about this book. Her husband read it and has incorporated the knowledge into his diet.  He lost 20 pounds immediately and says he feels great. My daughter-in-law, after 1 yr. gluten free, has improved her very serious joint condition in half. The doctor is very pleased.  I'm doing it for better health, not weight.  No more wheat for me!
B0000844I8|5.0|need anything more be said..this film led to 4 series and a lot of books ..wonderful and makes you wonder what if it really did exist!
0374533555|5.0|Book is amazingly well written and I would not only recommend it but I would even advise all to read this book.
B00005V9IL|5.0|as I rebuilt my collections this is a must for sci-fi and for just possibilities :), i had this on vhs and had to update !!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just a one time thing though. You won't be coming back for more that's for sure. Finis in half hour and then you are on your way
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Firstly I'm probably the only person to never read The Hunger Games as soon as I heard it was amazing. I took my time getting to this book and I should have listened to everyone else and raced to it, but I'm stubborn! Pushing that aside the Hunger Games is uniquely constructed, and has an extraordinarily built world that's vividly detailed. The characters are remarkable, each with a surprising amount of depth, and easy-to-like or easy-to-hate personalities. From the beginning you'll have your mind made up on whose good and whose bad--that will change. The heroine Katniss Everdeen is flawed yet has a lot of strength and courage. Right off the bat I really admired her for stepping up to protect her little sister Prim from the Games by taking her place. Her bravery is impressive but aside from that she's also a wood's warrior; she can climb trees, has deadly accuracy with a bow, and can hunt like nobody's business. Then there's Peeta - the bread making boy from her district whose also chosen for the arena. He's the epitome of all that is good, kind-hearted, self-sacrificing, and loyal to no end. His stability and confidence is unbelievably charming. His relationship with Katniss is complicated and beautiful--you'll be rooting for them throughout the entire story!<br /><br />I loved almost everything about The Hunger Games the only disappointment I had was that we rarely got to see much of Peeta as he and Katniss are often separated. Gale whom is Katniss' bestfriend from the district is mentioned frequently but we never really get to know him except through what we hear about him. Excluding those facts I enjoyed the camaraderie between the formed alliances, but was seriously devastated at the hopelessness of the situations all the characters find themselves in. Haymitch--Katniss and Peeta's mentor--is perhaps underrated but astronomically important in trying to help them succeed and stay alive. I feel that more credit is due to him as a past survivor of the Hunger Games, I loved that even though he's strange and irreparably damaged he gives them the tools necessary to have a good chance at beating the odds. He has such a darkly humorous outlook and it was refreshing of his character not to sugarcoat the very likelihood of death. I don't think many YA authors take such matters seriously enough and portrays important issues appropriately, but Suzanne Collins gets it and does it right. Those expecting romance will be satisfied and yet still want more. The Hunger Games is conceptually clever and extremely gripping. I was near tears during some of the scenes as they struck a chord inside that appeals to everyone's humanity. The world built and weaved into words is dark, seemingly despaired, and unjust but riveting nevertheless. The realness of it will chill your blood because the situations are pretty believable. Children and teens fight for their survival and are pitted against each other for the entertainment of the Capitol and the last one standing wins. It's beyond twisted, crosses many moral lines, but you won't be able to stop reading once you start. I'd strongly recommend for teens over the age of 14 due to violence, and human cruelty.<br /><br />Located in the ruins of North America lies 12 districts in a nation called Panem with a government-like society dead center named, The Capitol. You have to follow each and every rule because if you don't punishment is swift and deadly. Every year The Capitol holds and celebrates the biggest event--the Hunger Games. Children and teens are randomly selected and forced to participate in a life or death battle arena where only one can emerge as the victor. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen isn't looking forward to the reaping process this year particularly since she's got numerous chances of being selected. She's both horrified and shocked when her younger, and only sister Prim is chosen as the contender. She does the only thing that can save her--she offers to take her place. With this almost guaranteed death sentence Katniss must make some of the most difficult decisions that goes against her morals to make it out alive--and may the odds be ever in her favor--or not.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is wildly engaging and shockingly amusing. It's easy to lose track of time, minutes will turn into hours so beware of the addicting nature of this novel. It's a blend of science fiction, dystopia, with realistic conditions and futuristic-like advancements. If ever there was a trilogy worth reading it would be this one. It has a universal appeal, it can most definitely be enjoyed by both teens and adults. The Hunger Games is suspenseful, emotional, and a must-read. Collins has written a powerful story with authentic characters, and creates an unbelievably astonishing, and gritty world.ost guaranteed death sentence Katniss must make some of the most difficult decisions that goes against her morals to make it out alive--and may the odds be ever in her favor--or not.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is wildly engaging and shockingly amusing.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I like the fact that there are so many choices - different categories of pictures, choice of number of pieces (so my kids can play too), ability to rotate or not, and best of all... you can separate out the edge pieces.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He's a good writer and story teller, he grabs your interest and keeps you turning the page.  I have already recommended this to my friends!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Months after its initial release 999 became a cult title, helped out by the announcement of its sequel. I decided to give it a try just to check what the fuss was all about, slightly reticent considering it a graphic novel. It's true that ton of reading is involved in the &#34;gameplay&#34; but the puzzles (escape sections) are well designed and the story hooks you up until you unravel all the secrets of every character.<br /><br />As small drawbacks (any as big as to damage the end result): Lack of voices and some character designs that breaks the somber mood of the game.<br /><br />Just play it and don't forget to play its sequel after this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I saw this game that inspired me taste a horses life by getting  one.It was awesome and a brilliant idea.Enjoy the app my kids
B001GA1RFA|5.0|This books has a lot of mathematical concepts as compared to other books by the great John Green, and I actually like that. I might not be all that GOOD at math, but I still enjoy math, and reading a book that is not about math but still contains math is really really cool. So yeah.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|This case did not come with the clip to attach it to your belt.  I ordered 4 of them and now stuck without being able to use them.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Can't any of these apps be self explaining.  I downloaded this as I was told I needed it to operate camera.  Now that I have it, I have not one single hint as to how to use it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|The fact that she was about to be deported to Canada really tickled me. This story is really about two people that were not supposed to fall in love, but did. If people want a good laugh and a heart warming story, this is the movie to watch.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Challenging, yet fun to complete it in various ways.had a great time using Lego pieces in different structures. Loved it
B008VBYN80|3.0|not a bad game at all can go for a little tune up on the energy refill controls are a little choppy
B001KZG99A|5.0|as usual prove to be one of the best! Robert Downey jr....yes he is Iron Man.<br />it's a must see!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|dont waste your time on this game. i think u have no control over the person. when u jump u cant make the person go forward or backwards.u have no control. this. game is a scam.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One puzzle after another, and none of them add-and-find challenges. Beautiful graphics and good music too. Very enjoyable although short.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I must admit , I loved it. I waited a long time for it and was not happy with the delay. But I really enjoyed it and loved the amount of time the author really went into detail about their relationship and had a lot of chapters devoted to Eva and Gideon's relationship. It wasn't just the sex, although that was phenomenal. It was the actual dialogue between the two that I felt was more than we got in Bared and Reflected. I didn't like the Corinne and Megumi diversions, although I'm sure we will understand more in the final installments.  I would rather have had more insight into Gideon's mother and the rest of his family than Eva's coworkers.<br /><br /> I really don't get why people are complaining so much. We are GETTING MORE EVA and GIDEON!  All I ask is for a happy ending for this couple. I want a HEA at the end of CAPTIVATED by you and a grand finale HEA at the end of the fifth book.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I felt BTU, RIY and EWY did not flow well as three individual novels. But I think that neither Sylvia Day or her publishers expected Bared to be the blockbuster it was, so I think it ended up being a bit choppier than I would have liked. The ended of Reflected was poorly done probably due to editing. I don't like when books end up with a cliffhanger even when the readers know a third book is on the way.<br /><br />To sum up, I loved this book as much as the first two, if not more and I'm thrilled there will be two more.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Overall the season was 'ok'. The beginning episodes were great! However, after episode 5 it went down hill. First season was much better.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|Pros: The extension piece was just what i needed to further reach the position i required it for, just as stable as what you would have purchased with the original keyboard or any other wall mount.<br /><br />Cons: Pricing but i found this for a bargain compared to the manufacturers actual price. So that may not actually be a con.
B00992CF6W|5.0|computer is better than the kindle but kindle fire minecraft is still cool<br />Because it does not lag :)<br />Also it does not need to  pay 26$ on it
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|To be further immersed into this world of horror and amazement 3D surely sold me. It wasnt overly in depth but just enough to add to the movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|u should get it. it is awesome. it is even great for kids to get new crafts and other things off of!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a great kids movie with a little bit of adult humor that will make all members of the family happy, but not expose the kiddies to anything they shouldn't be watching or hearing.<br />I would recommend this movies to anyone and everyone.  Just plain fun and endearing!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie with my wife! It was easy to follow multiple story lines. Finally something different from mass produced Hollywood movies.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I purchased this movie after renting it. I watched it with a friend and we both agreed it was by the far the best movie we had seen in a long time! If you have someone in your family with a mental illness, you can definitely relate to the story. The story is serious, but has a lot of comic relief throughout. It really is a drama, comedy and love story all rolled into one. The acting is superb from the whole cast. You really can't go wrong with this movie. For once the critics hit it right!
B000G2AHUA|4.0|A great product! I all ready new this item and I´m aware that Timberland is a very good brand. The shoes are comfortable and will be even more comfortable as they aged.
B008Y778ZG|3.0|It was kind of long but the special effects were good. The story wasn't that engaging. I watched it off and on over a couple of days.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Very well written, thrilling as usual. I have the complete series and going in to the book I already know how it ends, but enjoying every word!!!
B002X1JKG4|4.0|Wonderfully entertaining story. A rollicking, hilarious western that seems to have aged well. A rare humorous role from Jody Foster.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Enjoyed this simple to read (bit of science in it but justifiably so) and its an eye opener. Will change the way you view your diet.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|I enjoyed the first season of the new Doctor Who.  It was fun and interesting.<br />My brother didn't feel like this doctor fit into the theme presented by the doctors in the old show.  I didn't have a problem with it.  Although the graphics of this Sci Fi show are not as nice as some movies/shows with similar themes having sort of &#34;cheesy&#34; graphics keeps the focus on the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good challenge.  not too hard and not too easy. im addicted. wish there was more levels. I hope they come soon!
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|If you have not purchased this concert yet because maybe you are set back from some of the negative reviews from ridiculous audio engineer expert wannabes who criticize a great piece of music with their nonsense. As a long time Dio fan and having listened to this album many times after I bought it, I can tell you that it sounds awesome. It has this special kind of feeling as if you were in the audience, like a previous reviewer described as a thunderous sound from the bass guitar and drums that you experience in a live show. I don't consider this anything negative, on the contrary is gives the listener the real feeling of a live show. Also I read some saying that Craig's guitar is buried in the mix which is totally false. His guitar playing as all the instruments are beautifully well balanced and crystal clear. I also noted after listening to several Craig Goldie performances were he sort of put his own style into the songs, were in this show he played everything very faithful to how Vivian played the songs. I love this concert, it's the entire show unedited and great track listings. The only negative I think is the keyboard solo which I think is a bit boring, but other than that this concert is perfect and one of the best Dio performances and I mean Dio as the whole band. Don't hesitate to purchase this for it's a great testament of what Ronnie gave all of us fans, a great piece of music.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love the game so much and so do my brother and sister. It is awesome!!!!!!!!!!<br />You should try it to!!!!!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love that I can see my Pinterest account now on Kindle a long with my other devices!  Great to have in kitchen when I have a new Pinterest recipe to try!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|this game is really great for when I am bored and have nothing else to do an my kindle overall is a good gamer
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I gave this rating because this is just a generic calculator and good for simple calculations.  I would recommend this for anyone who needs to perform quick calculations.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is very creative and has nice twists and turns. The characters are well written and The two main characters play off each other very well :-)
0553593714|4.0|The first 2/3rds of the book is entertaining, but the story is quite dark. It seems as if any display of honor and goodness will only cause one to be ground down and laughed at.  At least until toward the end of the book, when you find that many female characters (such at Catelyn & Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, and Dany Targaryen and even Sansa Stark, the Witch Doctor Mirri Matz Durr, and Osha the Wilding) who up to now seem to have been buffeted and beaten down by family obligations and the brutality they've grown up surrounded by...have grown and gotten a better handle on things. For good or bad, they learn to survive and succeed in becoming war counselors, tough young swordswomen, king makers, sorceresses, and valuable servants who fecklessly make the best of dire circumstances and become just as strong and sometimes stronger than the men. It is still a dangerous, unpredictable world but some of the women manage to be very influencial nonetheless.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is a pretty simple game but fun to play. My son and I enjoy playing it. It is easy enough for anyone to pick up and play.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a little easy. Wish there where more levels. I would recommend this game to any one who would like puzzles and to keep your brain sharp.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The lumineers rock!  They are the new band in folk/rock as far as I am concerned.  Can't wait to hear more of their music!
0500516766|4.0|The kid in all of us likes to take things apart.  Todd McLellan did an excellent job being a surrogate for us
1452110581|4.0|Anyone who knows and loves cats, will recognize the truth in these hilarious poems! They should make one feel dismayed about cats, but instead, these poems serve to make one love them even more!
0345529057|4.0|This was a surprise gift and so appreciated it....I will not be reading this but I'm hearing it's good for the person I bought it for, for me, I'm not interested int these types of books
B00AFPVPDG|2.0|If you're looking to spend some money on something you already know how to do, this book is for you.  Otherwise, save your money for something more worthwhile.  The title of this book got me but it really lacked substance.  All he does is tell you his method and then explains what he learned while he was using the method.  He goes into detail about what he learned while trying to get up to speed on yoga, the software language Perl and a few other things he finds interesting.  I feel that he was using the writing of the book as a tool to learn the material, not as a way to present some deep insight about how to learn something quickly.<br />The whole concept of the book is that if you spend 20 hours actively learning a new skill, you will become good enough at it.<br /><br />Save yourself some time by not reading this book.
B0031TZ8TU|2.0|I haven't read this book for quite a while, and I remember now why. I was not at all like a Ken Follett story. I found it overly long and really slow paced.
0812982622|2.0|The author is a beautiful writer but the story is troubling and not one I want to put in my head after a long day at work. Don't need any more disturbing subjects swirling in my head. I would love to read other material from this author.
B000000XB9|4.0|Not a bad song in this bunch! Great for dancing, parties, or simple remember when parties. Has the long version of GrapeVine&#34;
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've read this many times and reference it often to keep strong on my Wheat free diet.  I have had so many benefits from being wheat free!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Best line! What more can you say about this dvd... If you lift, you understand! If you don't lift, Start lifting! The dvd is great, it's as advertised
0316077046|4.0|I bought this for a pre-teen who is an avid book reader.  She is enjoying reading this series.  The books arrived as expected in excellent condition.  No complaints
B00597A6NU|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and I will see it again sometimes. Very well done, captured the error perfectly.
1416972242|4.0|I bought this for a pre-teen who is an avid book reader.  She is enjoying reading this series.  The books arrived as expected in excellent condition.  No complaints
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is different from the others because of how it hits all the sensitive spots in your heart. Much more depressing, and raw than the first 2 but still as great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|&#34;The Racketeer is definitely one of my favorite John Grisham....he grabs you from the start and surprises you in the end!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics, really really fun, music was creepy good,<br />could not put it down.  Looking forward to your next creation.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|For the hours it took to read this novel, i was truly brought to a Magic Kingdom where time stops and stories unfold in all their glory. Life becomes richer of books such as this. Give yourself a gift, and read this book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I can't get over how great your apps are I was a fan of 24/7 all but 1  of their mahjong games I would get half way or less I had to close each time. I even hit the wait button 6 TIMES AND STILL HAD TO CLOSE. THE BACKGROUND THE MUSIC THE STORY ARE UNBELIVEABLE. THE FREE APP WAS GREAT I COULDN'T ORDER THE COMPLETE GAME FAST ENOUGH.  I'M GOING TO SPEND FOUR HOURS LOOKING FOR ALL THE G5 APPS OUT THERE.. Don't get left behind try just 1 of G5 APPS you will be as excited as me.By the way I'm 54 and a grandma many times over.
B00AECDDYY|2.0|It is a fun game and it has good grafics but it is very one way.  You cant really steer the ships, you give them a one way heading and they just go at it head on.  No real stratagey here just build your ships as fast and you can and go at it.  I got bored with it pretty quickly but it is because I like a game where you have to think a little more.  It would have been much better if you could steer the ships and put them together in battle groups.  Kinda funny sometimes looking at all the cannon balls fying around.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Excellent live performance from Bonamassa. The guy is amazing & it's a shame more people don't know who he is. Well worth the money. Bought it for my father, we watched it together, & he enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing the coin dozer games and this is one of my favorites but I have tons of coins now but I don't know how to move on until I get more Dozer Dollars. I have completed most of the puzzles by collecting the puzzle pieces but now that I have I have no other way to earn the Dozer Dollars unless I purchase them and while I understand how they have to make money off of the game somehow, it just stinks that now I am at a stand still after playing for months. Well we will see if I purchase some Dozer Dollars and I will keep this updated so everyone know how to complete or win the game if that's possible. Try it it's a great time waster while your standing in line, at a appointment etc.....
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Best new band I've heard in almost 20 years. Excellent album with a sort of 70's sound to it, with a touch of Deep Purple sounding keyboards to it. The subject matter is gloomy & dark. Satanic & sexual, but done in a very interesting & entertaining way. Ghost will become a big name band & a major concert attraction in the near future. So avoid the rush & start listening now.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It lets you download or just stream youtube videos but with annoying popups that you have to answer.  There should be a way to set the answers for all uses, but if there is I have yet to find it.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Bought it for my father, & he liked it. So did I, I may be more of a hard rock/metal guy, so I appreciate great guitar work. Bonamassa is a great player, & an excellent showman.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|This is the perfect sleeve for my Kindle Paperwhite. It makes me much more comfortable to throw my kindle into my pack each day with it in this case. The material is strong and the construction is very sturdy.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|Loved this movie for it was great and even better on blluray...  It really is a top notched movie for anyone who loves vampire/weirwolf flicks.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Another Paulo Coelho book that should be on a must read list for everyone. He is truly a gifted a author.
034580404X|3.0|I like the books: or you're for it, or you're against it. Although a lot of people told me it's plain hard porn; it's not. It's a love story, funny written, specially for us in our monthly read. The only thing I was disappointed in, is that the main character was so 'easy'. I don't want to spoil things for people who haven't read it, so I'll leave it at that; I guess you'll know what I'm talking about when you've read it.
0425263924|3.0|I liked the book but I felt the repetition with certain words and terms of endearment where overused and almost unnatural. They lingered from the first book. Also, the repetitive notion that Eva couldn't believe how Gideon was with someone like her and how &#34;hot&#34; he was 24/7 exhausted me. I understand the author was creating the insecurity in the character but it didn't work for me.<br /><br /> While the main characters were easy to connect with, I found myself rushing through the intimate scenes. I got bored with it.<br /><br />I enjoyed it but would have liked to see Eva ( the main character) experience more independence and growth. But, we will wait to see what happens in the the next book (or two).
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This is a cute and fun game, but it's hard to start getting far since it asks so early for payment that's pretty hard to get so much of early on. Still, worth a play.
B0054SMID0|4.0|There was a little foul language, but other than that, it was a very solid movie - definitely worth a watch...
B00CKKDZ2S|2.0|I ordered this app. and was unpleasantly suprised. When you first start out it is not so bad. You pull up your past card, then your present. When you get to the future, you have to pay for it. It won't let you unlock the future unless you pay extra money. I'm not sure if you have to pay each time you use it or it's a one-time fee only. None the less, I think that is terrible, and quite a rip-off. Definitely a waste of space on my Kindle. Delete, delete, delete.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Good wall charger for the  kindle fire.  Old one was sub standard but it came with original bundle. Very flimsy and would not charge the kindle. Amazon customer service is Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thank you
B00BN2NY48|2.0|The show was not as beautiful as the other Cirque du Soleil I saw. Also, it kept getting interrupted due to some problem or other that I have not had with other shows.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|love this movie....weve watched so many times already.  great movie<br />you would enjoy it.  good music, if you appreciate music
B0066WJLU6|1.0|Worked the first day and then locked up every time I attempted to open it. I had to delete from Kindle
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|This was added to my kindle cloud player without my permission.  I do not like this kind of music therefore I had it deleted.
B008VBYN80|2.0|This is a pretty good game but you have to purchase diamonds to really do well.  You also have to have a lot of friends on a social network which I choose not to do, therefore I will definitely not play this for long. Make it play without others and I would consider buying the diamonds. Otherwise, not worth it to me.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I have been using the standard version of AccuWeather on my Kindle and have been very satisfied.  I thought perhaps the Platinum version would have more information and quite possible be more helpful but I was wrong.  I downloaded the Platinum and instantly did not like the content or the display.  Just have asked for a refund and will go back to using the standard version with great pleasure.
B001EBWISG|5.0|Violence, sex, Jewish mothering, guns, nanas painting dogs, cocaine, a million swear words, Robert DeNiro at several ages that are totally believable, great soundtrack, nice suits, and good shots of Italian food.  No better way to spend a few hours.
B007G5K066|5.0|Loved this version. The Blue ray is scrips and worth the extra bucks, although it comes with a DVD version. I hope the make the sequail soon, Smilies People.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|Can't say much about this that hasn't already been said, scared the whooza out of me the first time I saw it, scared a little less the 2nd time, a little less the following 100, and now it's just an old friend that happens to be an insane homocide-inclined weak spirit, like we all could become if we don't let ourselves type the same sentence a few thousand times.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|A wonderful exploration of humanity, but a bit dark for me. The Willy Loman-like main character is depressing. I had seen the movie Blade Runner years ago and don't recall feeling so much pity for Rick. Now I think I'll have another go at the movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is an awesome game, dudes! I know, the ACTUAL creators of this weren't Warner bro's, But it is still awesome!
B0042JTAI8|5.0|Kate Morton is an amazing author.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fascinating read and a well woven story.  The intrigue and mystery makes for a gripping story with none of the frantic tension of other books.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|So. Since I prefer to stay spoiler free in my reviews, I'll just say this. I truly enjoy watching this series with my wife. The characters and situations are engaging and realistic. The writing is well done and the acting is superb. I disagree with some of the decisions made in this season, but it is BBC after all, and they are always doing things I don't agree with! If you are a fan of British drama, watch this show!
B003O86FBS|5.0|Kate Morton's books are always a pleasure to read.  The story is completely gripping, but none of that frantic tension that that ends up freaking me out.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I'm a devout Les Mis fan having seen it on Broadway 3 times, live another half-dozen times, and countless watches of both the 10 year and 25 year shows.  So, I was unprepared for the impact this had on me -- the singing isn't as good and Crowe is a big disappointment for what should have been the best voice in the cast, but Hugh Jackman blew me away with the depth of his performance<br /><br />I have seen Jean Valjean die on stage many times, and this is the first time I was moved to near tears.  Emply Chairs was similarly dramatic and I will save everyone the repetitions about Fontine.  And the Blu Ray makes for a grand viewing spectacle that captures the screen (I have a 135&#34; projection system at home) and the sound is even better watched with a great surround system...<br /><br />Bharat
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Incredible book, fascinating insight into life not only in North Korea but it's prison camps as well. Glad he made it out okay (spoiler!)
B008NMT684|5.0|My son has been playing with these puzzles on my kindle fire now for sometime. He gets better and better at them and loves it when he completes a puzzle. I love to watch and sometimes help him!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read. It is possibly as good as Fifty Shades but also seems to copy parts of fifty. Good to read while waiting on more from fifty.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|If there were a place called Westeros, I would refer to George's third masterpiece as a historically accurate novel. The realism and depth George has created cannot be matched in fictional works. His characters are humans as opposed to idealised fantasies and it makes for unpredictable and engaging narratives that stay with you long after you have turned the last page.
B00992CF6W|1.0|When on multiplayer, after a while, minecraft crashes. I don't mean the app. I mean the ENTIRE DEVICE CRASHES. IT TAKES OVER TWENTY MINUTES TO GET MY DEVICE TO WORK AFTER THAT.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock. Love that it shows you how much time untill the alarm goes off. Wished that the gradual setting was a little prolong. It goes from quiet to loud somewhat quick.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Worth the wait, this game is like SIM city but a little hard and in depth , I definitively recommend this game
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Though you do have access to the Kindle Video Library with your Kindle, this is the easiest app for viewing youtube videos, and for saving videos as well.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I enjoyed he action, humor, and intensity of Marvel's &#34;The Avengers&#34;. The writing of the script was well done and I am happy with the outcome.
1439127727|5.0|Though I'm not normally a non-fiction fan, this book definitely caught my interest. I enjoyed the storytelling approach to these lesser-known historical facts.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Its helpful in all way possible for all people even old people like my self because you can change the font size.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was exciting and colorful.  And added to the Wizard of Oz which is one of my favorite movies.  I would recommend this to anyone
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This game is really fun and has great replayability. I recommend this game to anyone who like any management games.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't really understand what exactly was the huge fuss about this novel, I really don't. I'm at chapter nine and I already have doubts about continuing this book. When people mentioned how repetitive this book was, I SERIOUSLY thought they were kidding. Boy was I wrong. I'll leave you to count how many repeats were in that story. Reply when you have the correct number.<br /><br />In the beginning, I did grow a little attached to Christian Grey only until you slowly see how he react to other characters. He's a billionaire who is using it for world hunger or something, he's cold hearted to his employees and very demanding. However that's not even half. You find out that he has a fetish for insane BDSM and wants every girl to sign a document stating that what goes on, stays between them two. It also states what she has to wear, when to eat, when to sleep, when to exercise, and even how to look in her woman area. Sounds to me like an insecure control freak.<br /><br />A little too much for my taste but Ana is going along for the right because she never made love before. I'm sorry, after being in a domestic violent relationship, I was completely hating his character. For some reason he get referred to Edward Cullen from twilight while Ana is of course Bella due to her lack of balance when he's around. I disagree since twilight is an overly dramatic love story while this one is a love story that seems like a repetitive document made from teens with deep fantasies.<br />Maybe this is indeed for the Twilight Fans.
B00B5AIB50|5.0|Excellent discussions about Karajan's recording habits by his producers and recording/sound engineers. Interview tibits complete the picture of this extraordinary musician and his recorded legacy.
1616551151|5.0|Neatly crafted almanac of knowledge. Well organized, amazingly illustrated, sturdy and durable. I like to get back to it every now and then to know more about the world of Thedas.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Stray Souls is a great hidden object/puzzle game. I M H O,  Alawar games are always very good. SS works well inky Kindle Fire,  the game screen is fully presented, I.e.,  not coveredby ads ormenu tabs. Puzzles are just puzzling snug but not exasperating. A standard type story, missing spouse to hang the game on,  and off you go on a preety neat. time filler. Buy it, its good.
B002KEZ96Y|1.0|Dude, this is not just the worst movie of the Coen Brother's career, this is the worst movie ever!  Words can't describe my contempt for this film.
B002BVQU5A|1.0|Every aspect of this film made me wish I didn't have eyes or ears.  The characters and plot were as flat as roadkill but at least roadkill once had life.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|At first it seemed like the picture perfect love story between Savannah and John but then came 9-11and John stayed in the military but their plans had changed and Savannah fell in love with another guy. Their love was still present but they both new her new found husband would keep their love apart. The ending was not good though.. and John ended up alone watching Savannah mode happily along with her now healthy husband.
B0000634EV|5.0|I just absolutely love DOWN so i just had to scoop it up.This down album has alot of very personal deep,hardcore messages in it. Nice and southern bluesy sound. Nice to light a doob and listen to this. Phil and the gang are on point,i love every song. It may take a spin or 2 for you to get it but once you do you will know what i mean. These songs are all catchy and addictive. Down outdid it on this one,this is second favorite to NOLA. But i suggest if you like anything Phil Anselmo or Pepper Keenan,Rex Brown,Jimmy Bower,or Kirk Windstein you will love this album. Go buy it and support your favorite musicians !
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I think everyone should try and get this game because it is a class game to play. It is very active and can get you started.;)
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|This is a good album,im not a huge Queens of Stone fan but this album i picked up cuz i liked Era Vulgaris . I spun it 2 times in a row and found half of the songs to be really catchy and addictive and the others to be stanard and just alright tunes. Good mellow music from a good creative mind,love the lyrics. Song structures are good. If you like Queens pick it up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and there are so many updates that come out every few months so you never know will be next like buckets and enderman
B0001Z363W|5.0|This album is like Part 2 of Book of Shadows (which i prefer) but this album picks up where Shadows left off. Nice mellow jams,some acoustic some heavier but no insane out the amp blaring BLS bar fight music. This is aptly titled and for the right reasons,Hangover Music cuz it is a nice mellow way to wake up and hear with a hangover to kinda get you in motion. Love the guitars,love the bass lines and the drums have a super good sound. Check it out you wont be disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is by far the easiest to use on this device. the simple keystrokes and quality is amazing to me. I love it.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|She is taking French and she love all parts of her present from Grandma. She has watched it several times and we have also been a captive audience as she became more and more excited over her gift.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it was better than i had expceted i can not wait for more levels this has become a great time killer
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Been waiting years for Magic on android... Very nice port of the xbox/pc game. Works great on my original Samsung Galaxy tab.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Just begining, Just ok..was expecting more  , ,i hope it gets better as i progress more in to the game and advance to more levels
B004LROUNG|4.0|Fun story; read in two days.  Loved the characters and was rooting for each of them.  This book will not disappoint!
B000W967UQ|5.0|I originally read this long ago but I enjoyed it enough that I wanted it in electronic format as well.  It was one of my first Pratchett novels and it, along with Pyramids, pretty much cemented my love of all things Discworld.  If you like fantasy with a side of humor along, then you'll enjoy this book.  If you prefer your fantasy to be all stoic elves and evil orcs, then you may want to look elsewhere.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone that wants a mind blowing challenge. Any ages could play. Lots and lots of fun!!!
0375842209|5.0|Personification of Death was effectively used such that protagonist and other characters were enhanced.  Unfortunately, we have been desensitized by stories of slaughter, rape and with this new twist, it brings fresh air to humans from a different perspectives.  Here we have Death working &#34;to death.&#34;
B00005NGAK|5.0|What a joy it was to watch this final performance in Hyde Park of Lord Of The Dance, and to see how it had evolved from its first performance in Dublin.  It must have been a magical experience to sit in that enormous crowd watching Michael Flatley and all the rest of that superb group dancing their hearts out.<br />The Gypsy, the little Sprite and the Irish colleen looked no older than they had at the beginning, although the Lord and Don Dorcha had both weathered magnificently.  Erin the Goddess still enchanted with her magic voice, while the two violinists drew cheers, applause and screams from the rapt crowds.  I never saw violinists receive such an ovation before these two virtuosos hit the scene!<br />Altogether, a stunningly exciting experience, leaving Michael Flatley (to quote a banner raised in the crowd) \\"Dancing in our hearts forever\\".
B009MO5E10|4.0|Plain and simple -- this is an awesome movie!  No need to break it down by believable timeline or whether or not the characters were given back stories -- they don't need them.  It's about bike messengers, the risks they take and the fast paced lives they lead.  I watched it this weekend with my daughter -- she's 26 and I'm 59 -- and we were both on the edge of our seats, yelling at the screen and cheering for the good guys.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is so easy on the eyes, too!  The camera work in this movie is nothing short of stunning and the pace never slows down.  The crazy wild-eyed nutcase of a cop is played by the same actor who plays the crazy wild-eyed IRS psychopath in Boardwalk Empire.  Has a great story attached to the envelope he is trying to deliver and keep away from the bad guy.  We liked it so much we're going to buy it.  Usually I do hobbies while watching a movie, but this one had all my attention and flew by!  The ONLY reason I didn't give the DVD set five stars is they didn't put any extras!  Really?  I cannot believe they didn't have extras for this movie.  With all the stunts and camera work involved, not to mention how in the world they filmed through busy NYC streets, there must be tons of great bloopers, outtakes and deleted scenes!!!  Shame on them for not taking the time to include those for the purchaser.  STAY TUNED THROUGH THE CREDITS at the end of the movie -- there is a quick scene of an injury Joseph Gordon Levitt suffered during the filming that required 31 stitches!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is the perfect time killer,so if you are in the waiting room somewhere time will fly and  you  Will be in a lot better mood,ones the waiting is over.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Not sure this movie would stand alone very well.  Need to see Before Sunrise for the beginning of the relationship.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I don't normally sit to write a review directly after reading a book.<br />I don't normally give five stars either.<br /><br />When I write a review, I usually write it pretty quickly.<br />I free associate.<br />I try not to come up with particular things I want to say or put together some grand passion play in an attempt to bask in the light cast by that thing I am attempting to review nor do I hide in the shadow cast by the pale moonlit glow of a poorly told tale.<br /><br />Today, I don't know what to say exactly.<br /><br />Part of me wants to sit here and just continue to let this book resonate through me like a haunting melody.<br />Another corner inside begs me to tell everyone I meet that they must read the book.<br />I guess, I have chosen the latter (having given myself a few moments to enjoy the afterglow).<br /><br />This is quite simply the most incredible novel I have read in a very long time and it may find itself in the annals of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />Those of you that follow my reviews know I write very little of plot.<br />As I note in my profile, dust-jackets serve that purpose.<br />I write about how a book makes me feel.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" made me feel much like a seven year-old boy.<br />I was transported back in time to a place where magic existed in my heart.<br />So too was there fear and heartbreak.  There was wonder and dreams.<br />The grass smelled sweetly and the rain gave itself to thunder and lightning which always lit up my mind with myths, legend and unearthly tales.<br />I was transfixed, enrapt by every word, every beautiful description of heart, of soul, of that which cannot be named and I actually feel changed (even even for a little while).<br />When you read this book, you might appreciate that notion in the context of some of the last words spoken.<br /><br />You will become a child reading this book.<br />Not only in that you will be seeing through the eyes of one, but you will be awed by the worlds that you left behind brought to the fore by the genius that Neil Gaiman has brought in this novel.<br />I did not want it to end and yet it ended exactly the only place it could.<br /><br />Do I gush?<br />Is it that good?<br />Is this \\"too much?\\"<br />You let me know when you finish.<br />I might still be sitting right here.<br /><br />Namaste~ll be awed by the worlds that you left behind brought to the fore by the genius that Neil Gaiman has brought in this novel.<br />I did not want it to end and yet it ended exactly the only place it could.<br /><br />Do I gush?<br />Is it that good?<br />Is this \\"too much?\\"<br />You let me know when you finish.<br />I might still be sitting right here.<br /><br />Namaste~
B002XXNSF6|4.0|Interesting dialogue between young people exploring the world and their possible connection to each other.  It provides a way for a couple to remember and relate their own story to the movie.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|There is nothing better than relaxing with The Eagles music playing.  You know the songs, you know all the words, and you can't help but sing right along with them.<br />This DVD package does not disappoint.  So fun to watch and of course to sing along with.<br />I will watch this over and over again.....
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Not only an absolutely beautiful Christmas movie, but this story highlights the values of what truly is important in life. Someone who is not of high financial means, but a man of supreme moral character and kindness, comes to the realization that he is, indeed, the richest man alive.  He has something which supersedes wealth - the love of not only his family -  but of all the friends and neighbors who have had his loyalty for life.  As simplistic as this may sound,the kindness you bestow on others is its own reward.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love CCR and liked the idea of John making an album of his music from that era with other artists.  Sounds great and have told other friends about it.
B001NLKS16|5.0|Having the journal that Sam and Dean use throughout the show is great. We get to see how John became the expert hunter he became and how he learned all he taught the boys. For any fan of the show this is a must have.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Alzheimer's is a frightening condition to those who have it and those close to them. This book speaks of the vulnerability of all involved. It is a touching story with believable characters.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of the CW's show Supernatural should check this book out. It gives a little more info on Bobby's character, who I personally loved in the show. Hated to see him die.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed this book. My only criticism is that the author was waaay to descriptive about minor things . . . for instance, she went into way too much detail about her work building and how it was structured and the various people in her department and their duties. The author seems to have first-hand familiarity with a specialized field (forensic pathology), so it was interesting to get a look into that world, but overall it seemed like the plotting got bogged down in details.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My children and I all have this game for our Kindle Fire Hd's and out iPhone's. We love it. The one draw back is that it is a little addictive and you can end up wasting more time than you plan when you start playing it. :)
B000W9399S|3.0|I really liked a book that Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman collaborated on so I thought I would give this one a try. I was unable to finish it . . . I had trouble keeping track of the characters and the pacing seemed off. Also it wasn't really as funny as I thought it would be, from other people who love the Discworld series.
0316044695|5.0|marcus Luttrell story - very good book - this was one of the first Seal books that I read and I truly enjoyed it.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like these games. The more you play the games the more points you collect. I like that I get more games to buy with my point's when I play. I reccomend this app for all ages.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Don't believe what the critics and media said. The only bad thing about this movie is that it came out after \\"Avatar\\", which set the bar way too high on movies like this. Beautiful imagery and storyline, even for something that was written almost 100 years ago. This is sci-fi gold that is under-appreciated because many people who say \\"it sucks\\" haven't even watched it. If you can find the 3D version, and are set-up for 3D, it's definitely worth adding to your collection.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Some people said they didn't like it, but they must not have been Bourne movie fans. Very good movie, liked it
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I purchased this video for my granddaughter who is 7 and she was very happy with it. she watches it several times a week.

B001F6TXME|5.0|I use this remote for long exposures in Bulb mode for my Nikon D7000.  I used it this weekend and it worked as it's supposed to. I was able to to take exposures of any length desired on some water fountains and also a storm moving across our town with lightning.  Works great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Book was both witty and romantic. Everything a girl wants in a book. You will fall more in love with the story as you read on. Definitely recommend reading!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart is great, such a star. Very much enjoyed this CD and look forward to more by the artist !
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|As with many others, my family and I watched the original Wizard of Oz at least once a year.  Many of us grew older and experimented with the original movie images and the music of Pink Floyd.  Sadly, after probably 40+ viewings, the original movie lost a bit of charm and quite a bit of &#34;excitement&#34; -- probably because we had an over-dose of exposure.<br /><br />Disney has a masterful prequel to the original -- it brings to our attention aspects of the tale that I, for one, never ever considered.  Things like &#34;where did the wizard come from&#34; and &#34;how did he get his particular powers&#34;?  And this fantastic film answers all these things and many more!<br /><br />The filming, sets, colors, music, and characters are amazing.  Watch this and, IMHO, you and yours will probably watch it at least annually -- and probably follow this new feature with another run of the original.  It's a blast!
0316113514|5.0|That is a great Information, on Sparks, I would give it 5 stares, there a more of that kind<br />Of books around I hope you can help me find them on Amazon I be grateful, I have a<br />Granddaughter with learning Problems ,<br />Thank you very much'<br />Eva Hendricks!
1781162646|4.0|For those of us that are King fans, and I am one of them, this may be a bit of a disappointment for lack of chills. I read this over the 4th of July weekend, and at first I found this to be a ho hum novel. No frights or chills in store in this one. It takes place in 1973, surrounding the carnival and the unexplicable murder of a young girl taking a ride on rickety carnival ride. Her throat has been slashed, but who killed her?<br />Enter Devin Jones, a twenty one year old down on his luck kid who has had his heart broken by the girl he loves. He spends his summer to get over her at Joyland, a small carnival in the middle of nowhere. He hears of the murder, he and his freinds attempt to solve the murder of the woman. As a side story, he gets involved with a teen with Muscular Dystrophy, who's \\"bucket list\\" is to enjoy Joyland without any physical limitations. Meanwhile he falls in love with the kids mother.<br />This book was decent, I was a little worried about the plot, but I think that King did a great job pulling it all together for the reader. Cant wait to read his next novel, Doctor Sleep, a sequel to The Shining, coming out Sept 2013.<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I really liked this mouse when i saw it online but like if your a woman with bitty hands like mine its just too big, its huge even for a gaming mouse! if you like that its a great mouse but for me its just too big and made my hand hurt after awhile, but I am still giving it 4 stars because its well made and well thought out, compared to a razer mouse its worth the money for this if you love big mice, I just cant use it due to wrist pain. It's neat looking though. If you have a gaming rig with blue lighting everywhere this one is a good choice and it won't cost you a fortune, the weights are genius too, just make a smaller one!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|They did good movie. adventure and good hd 3D , good story. they are part copy orginal wizard of oz 1939. i enjoy it so good.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|A very helpful book for school and l use it all the time. If you don't have one you should get one!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|\\"I guess that's what makes lust so bittersweet. The feeling is beautiful, but the effort it takes to deny it is way too hard.\\"<br /><br />I have so much I want to say about this deeply moving story, but saying too much might spoil it for those who haven't read it yet, so I'll try my best not to include any spoilers. I have conflicting feelings about Hopeless and to be honest I couldn't make up my mind whether I wanted to rate it three stars or four. After a lengthy aromatic soak in the tub, I made up my mind to settle on a four-star rating. Here's why.<br /><br />\\"I hate that there are so many sides to him that I don't understand, and I don't know if I even want to keep trying to understand them. There are parts of him I love, parts of him I hate, parts that terrify me and parts that amaze me. But there's a part of him that does nothing but disappoint me...and that's the absolute hardest part of him to accept.\\"<br /><br />First of all, I liked both the main characters. They're complex, sometimes frustratingly temperamental, and other times just plain full of it. But still, their emotions and reactions to certain situations were realistic and relatable, and their snarky banter often had me in stitches - especially the text messages. I loved how they challenged each other and how they brought out the best in each other. Their attraction was instant and sizzling hot, and even though I'm not a fan of insta-love, this didn't annoy me at all.  The second thing I liked about this book was the sensitive subject matter and how insightfully the author put it into words. I can't identify with either Sky or Holder's experiences, but heaven knows what Sky suffered is something no child should have to endure. I had the same amount of sympathy for Holder also for what he had to overcome. These two characters complemented each other perfectly and I'm happy with the way it all came together at the end. I also adored Six and Breckin and the story would've definitely had less of an impact without them.<br /><br />\\"Let me inform you of something,\\" he says in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed Hopeless, I also feel that at times there were a little too much of everything. Too much angst, too much kissing (about a hundred pages too much of that), and too much drama which just left me emotionally worn out.  About a hundred pages in I already grasped the bigger picture. They're two halves of a unit where one half can't function without the other. They need each other to heal. But it just went on and on and on. It didn't make me enjoy the story less, it just moved too slow for my taste.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about it, though, is that the author didn't mould the \\"villain\\" (so to speak) into a typical, clich&eacute;d cartoon-villian character. Yes, I despised him for what he'd done, but I also wanted him to find redemption and atone for his wrongdoings - although personally I feel there shouldn't be a place in society for such people. Anyway, my point is that the author evoked conflicting feelings in me for this specific character, and that, to me, is a sign of a writer who uses a no-holds-barred approach in showing the reader that people aren't always what they appear to be and how easily trust can be broken by the ones we love the most. So, despite my complaints, I think this is a phenomenal read that wormed its way into my heart, and is fully deserving of all the glowing reviews it's receiving. This is another book I've read because of all the hype it's receiving and although it didn't fully live up to my expectations, it didn't disappoint either. I recommend it to everyone who enjoyed Katie McGarry's Dare You To.pact without them.<br /><br />\\"Let me inform you of something,\\" he says in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss.

B000L53D4O|4.0|I purchased this for my 10 month old. She was already pulling herself up on all the furniture in our living room and cruising along the couches, so this was just something for her to hold onto and walk with. For that purpose, it was perfect. She could walk around with it easily. It supports her weight just fine. The only complaint is the wheels don't turn and work all that well. When she gets on our tile kitchen floor, it kind of just goes in whatever direction she's going in, no matter what. She can't turn it around on the hard surface. On the carpet, it works better. She can hold on and pull herself up just fine and usually if she falls, she just lands on her bottom. The &#34;activities&#34; on the front of it aren't exciting, but she likes spinning them around a bit... but I didn't buy it for the &#34;activities.&#34; I bought it as a walker and it serves that purpose just fine.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Holds your interest and very well written. Really do love her writing style alot.  Can't wait for the next book!!!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|So, I just finished The Last Olympian, the fifth book in the Percy Jackson series and I don't get who Jason is…
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Similar to other games but thisbone is much more challenging.  Big Fish knows game entertainment. I suggest it for any &amp; EVERYONE!
B00004SZWD|5.0|I had not heard this \\"album\\" in its entirety since 1977. And, unlike so many things from our youth that, when revisited as an adult, take on the typical jaded overtones, SITKOL retains it's powerful, evocative relevance through the composite language of R&B-soul-pop-rock-jazz. The years may fade but this eclectic collection of \\"Songs\\" does not.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this sharpener to sharpen the Myerchin Sailing Knife Combo Tool Marlin Spike MYP300SL.<br /> It has a serrated edge and this sharpener has a tapered diamond chip impregnated tool for that.
B001675SOY|4.0|Hatebreeder was the second full-length studio album by the Finnish Melodic Death Metal band Children Of Bodom. It was released in 1999, and remains one of the fan's favourite records, containing tracks that no concert would look right without.<br /><br />This was back in the band's most Neoclassical sounding days, and before they added the slower grooves with 2005's \\"Are You Deat Yet?.\\" The sound on this record is blistering high speed Power Metal sounding music full of virtuosic keyboard solos and dual guitar melodies, but played with the savage ferocity of a particularly nasty Thrash Band, with little touches of European Death Metal in there, and Black Metal influenced harsh vocals topping it all off. Basically, imagine At The Gates playing Helloween or Stratovarius covers and you'll get a ballpark idea.<br /><br />The album has a very enjoyable clear production job (that doesn't feel overproduced) and the music and lyrics are a bit more serious and tasteful than on later Bodom records. There is nothing in the way of filler, the whole album is just track after track of savagely performed, yet entertainingly cheesy, virtuosic Metal.<br /><br />Highlights include the opener `Warheart,' as well as `Downfall,' `Silent Night, Bodom Night' and `Bed Of Razors.'<br /><br />Overall; if you want some speedy double kicks, lots of impressive shredding and keys and the fun parts of Power Metal played with the ferocity of Kreator, then Children Of Bodom are something you may be interested in. If you do check out and enjoy Children Of Bodom, then Hatebreeder is really worth trying. It's a succinct, consistent, high-energy blast of Bodom and I'd highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I don't think it downloaded properly.  There were no instructions how to play.  It's a good concept, but only a picture of a room came up with no idea what to do next.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|wow what a great album.  when it first came out 3 years ago i liked it...but in the time since it has set in as a true classic.  im not sure they'll ever be able to top it.  i fully expect the next album (due out aug 2013) to take an entirely different direction.  similar to what metallica did with load
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The movie was intense and made me feel sad for all those who went through this devastating experience. The biggest problem with the movie was Amazon Instant Video. You buy it and it says it's in your video library but it never showed up there and I had to watch it on my computer. I give the movie 5 stars but because of Amazons Instant Video site and check out, I rate it 3 stars for the problems I had once again. I now purchased a subscription to Redbox from Verizon to to stop all the problems from Amazon!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the history blended with some splendid acting and humor at times! Shirely Maclaine makes a perfect addition to this season's show!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|This film is totally I unsatisfying experience. There is nothing of redeeming value in the plot. The special effects are the most salient parts of the film.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good read. Way too emotional and irrational behavior by Ana.  Needed to develop the back story more and the sexual triads were over  done and became boring boring  after the 12th chapter.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I read the entire book and never really felt connected. A little far fetched on some of the plot lines. Probably will not go out of my way to read another book from this author.
0425263924|5.0|I was counting down the days until this book became available. i loved every minute i spent reading about Gideon Cross. I could not put it down! A must read series! Gideon Cross was perfect. I hope that we can see what happens next in their marriage! And I hope to learn more about Eva's roommate.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I have read some of the reviews where others have had problems downloading, picking things up and game freezing up. I have not experienced any of these problems on my Kindle Fire with this game. It is fun and engaging and well worth the price. I have played it a few times now and it is still challenging enough to keep my interest. I play it and then put it back in my cloud for a few months before I pull it out again. I am glad that I have a few games like this to pull out again between New games being released!
B00003CXA6|4.0|Movie is a little slow in some parts, but all and all we enjoyed it.  Very nice to see historical recreations.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was lovely story!  I couldn't put it down! Very enjoyable book to read and the ending was a what I was hoping  for
1781162646|4.0|This is an exceptionally fine coming-of-age tale, a theme at which Stephen King has always excelled, in a way no other modern writer ever has. It's about a 21 year old guy called Devin who just split up with his first real girlfriend.<br /><br />Of King's other books, this reminded me most of \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" - although \\"Joyland\\" is a far shorter, less complex production.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of King's skill in this book is that they serial killer who is operating as the story unfolds is observed very much from the sidelines. We observe things from Devin's point of view, after all, and in his mind his precarious emotional state is of far more compelling interest than the doings of a creepy psycho.<br /><br />Even so, there are strong supernatural elements which may or may not be to everybody's taste... I found they resonated with me because they seemed so very appropriate and \\"right\\" in the setting of the \\"Joyland\\" fairground. Furthermore, they seemed true expressions of Devin's confused and reluctantly maturing moods.<br /><br />All in all, this is vintage King and, especially for those who loved \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", I'd surely recommend it - just don't expect it to have the same depth and complexity.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|mine came on time in perfect condition! and this cd is amazing, mumford and sons are so so so talented.

B008JFUQ16|3.0|\\"Despicable Me\\" was about fatherhood, in which archvillain Gru (Steve Carell) discovers there's more to life than stealing the moon, like adopting three adorable moppets: eldest Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) who is just discovering boys,  ninja-in-training Edith (Dana Gaier) and unicorn-obsessed Agnes (Elsie Fisher). \\"Despicable Me 2\\" is about Gru completing the standard family unit by finding a mate. This is an entertaining sequel that fails to surpass the original, at least due in part to this single plot point -- the villains, the gadgets, and the minions are all ancillary to the object of Gru's romance, Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).<br /><br />Lucy's the best thing about the film.  The animators have captured every comic tic of Wiig, who infuses Lucy with a manic competence.  Where Gru is an outdated villain who hasn't kept up with the times, Lucy is a product of a new era of empowered women who kicks open doors in heels and a skirt. This is embodied by their first encounter (played repeatedly in the trailers) where Gru loudly announces his intention to attack (\\"Freeze ray!\\") his presumed foe by whipping out a clunky weapon; in response, Lucy pulls out a lipstick Taser and easily incapacitates Gru and then announces with a flourish: \\"LIPSTICK TASER!\\"<br /><br />Lucy recruits Gru into the AVL to stop a villain who has stolen mutagen PX-41, which turns living things into purple killing machines. He's hiding out in the Paradise Mall, so it's up to Gru and Lucy to go undercover as partners at an ice cream shop to catch the villain and find the mutagen.  The plot is surprisingly similar to \\"Chuck.\\"<br /><br />The first twenty minutes --- where Lucy recruits Gru into the AVL, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) quits for another employer, the girls work to bring Lucy and Gru together, and the minions go missing -- are the best part. The minions are actually integral to the plot here in a way that's not entirely kid-friendly, and though \\"Despicable Me 2\\" works hard to defang them, the film makes it clear that monsters infected by the mutagen will eat little girls.<br /><br />That's \\"Despicable Me 2\\"'s main flaw, and it's a big one.  The bad guy, a has-been coming out of retirement, doesn't seem well-suited to the villainous plan.  The surprise twist as to Dr. Nefario's employer isn't a twist at all, and the entire film pivots on his change of heart.<br /><br />SPOILER ME TOO: Or to put it another way, neither Lucy nor Gru actually does anything of substance here, it's all Dr. Nefario, who apparently didn't understand that making purple monsters that will eat the world means it will eat \\"his family\\" too. If anything, Nefario should have more affection for the minions than for the girls, as his relationship with the girls is never developed on screen between both films.  More galling is that super-competent Lucy is relegated to a damsel in distress, capable of taking on Gru but ushered off screen onto a rocket without even throwing a punch.<br /><br />Kids won't care about this of course.  \\"Despicable Me 2\\"'s formula has always been adult themes hidden behind a teeming mass of yellow minions to keep the kiddies entertained, and they are in full force here. There's plenty of eye-popping 3D visuals to keep the movie bumping along, and my son was sufficiently entertained by all the fart jokes (he's a five-year-old boy, the filmmakers know their audience).  But as an adult I couldn't help but feel like this was a missed opportunity.

B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Well, my wife and I got through almost half the movie.  She dozed off and I went back to my Spider Solitaire.  The decent reviews on Rotten Tomatoes must have been meant for another movie.  This one was boring as heck.  I felt detached from the characters after they were introduced.  The story was about as original as a 4th grader's \\"how I spent my summer vacation\\".  Fortunately the $5 it cost me is no big deal, but I still feel ripped-off.  Only nice thing to say: nice colors.<br /><br />Otherwise, I recommend watching it when it's available for streaming.  That way you won't feel like you could have ended up happier just throwing $5 into the trash and having an hour to do something less boring, like watching paint fade.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I had heard of these trains - but it's so interesting to really hear a story about something that MIGHT have happened.<br />Really a good read.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|I was aware of the issue(s) but watched this with a friend who is reasonably well informed who knew nothing of the risks (or earthquakes in Akron which aren't mentioned on this film).  Only wish I had HBO so as to be able to see gasland2  AND.. wondering what/how I can act so as to help prevent the US from becoming a 3rd world country (which may seem overstated but...
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's a great app for testing it's so fast I use all the time I always tell people about this app it's just GREAT
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Every time I watch this movie I am reminded how much I enjoy it. Let me say from the start that I grew up on the original series (TOS), and I am a die-hard \\"Star Trek\\" fan. However, since TOS is truly unique and unrepeatable, I don't judge the movie by those standards, as I think to do so is a losing proposition. Why not let this movie stand or fall on its own merits? Why not appreciate it for what it is rather than what some people imagine it should have been?<br /><br />For people familiar with TOS, there are definitely moments that are genuinely Star Trek, such as the interactions between Kirk/Spock and Kirk/McCoy. It was funny, for instance, to hear what they suggested as the origins of McCoy's nickname, Bones. McCoy also has some classic moments when, like his TOS counterpart, his emotions get the better of him. And then there is the scene where Chekov attempts to speak his password to the computer, only to be initially rejected because of his thick Russian accent (\\"Wictor, Wictor\\" instead of \\"Victor, Victor\\"). These are the kinds of moments that made TOS truly memorable, and it was wonderful to see them in the movie.<br /><br />I think Zachary Quinto does exceedingly well as the young Spock. I found young Kirk's character to be a little more reckless than I think is necessary, but Chris Pine did a fine job portraying him. We learned the first names of several major characters. There is plenty of action, excellent special effects, and a good story line. And, just like TOS, there are some very funny one-liners.<br /><br />I actually would give the movie four and a half stars if I could. Despite the high entertainment value of this movie, there were a few things that proved to be just plain silliness for me. Overall they did not ruin the movie, but they were certainly momentary distractions and warranted a minor deduction in my rating:<br /><br />1. The whole Spock/Uhura romance is utterly foreign to TOS, so I don't know why it was introduced in this movie. It just seemed pointless to me.<br /><br />2. The idea of the \\"red matter\\" was also problematic. TOS was consistent in making the science of its day very believable. Even though the show was science fiction, many of the concepts contained therein were based on real science. How is it, then, that while one drop of the red matter can create a small black hole, it can be touched with a syringe and stored in a container?<br /><br />3. Arguably the most absurd aspect of the technology in the movie was the decision to use a brewery for the engineering shots. My goodness, it's the 23rd century. Take a look at the Enterprise's bridge. It's brimming with ultra hi-tech equipment, yet the engineering section of the ship consists of lots of pipes, valves, barrels, and very 20th-century looking panels and boxes. Bad, bad choice.<br /><br />Despite these minor distractions, I would definitely recommend this movie. It is highly entertaining, fast-paced, action-filled, and engaging.
B007C52NY2|5.0|This is one of the better trilogies I have read. Larsson was a terrific writer and I was looking forward to reading more from this talented author; he will be missed.<br /><br />If you like a good mystery novel I highly recommend this trilogy. Unfortunately, the movies are a little too graphic (sex wise) and could of achieved a similar result without the graphic nature of the rape scene etc.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|DeMille blew this one. John Corey was a pain in the ass. Every other paragraph was Corey's smart-ass comment. Book should have been 200 pages. DeMille spent too much time (chapters and chapters) reviewing the same stuff over and over. When it finally ended, it was so abrupt, that I was shocked.  No explanation on how they got out of Yemen. Felt like DeMille was meeting a press deadline and ended the book so that FedEx driver could pick it up.  Very, very disappointing!  Didn't like it at all!
B006T5GTK0|4.0|A Town Like Alice is my absolute favorite book. I've watched the Masterpiece Theater version so many times I almost know it by heart.  This version really only deals with the first half of the story, and doesn't have the subtext of her solicitor's affection, but it was touching and well-acted. Note: it's in B&W.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies in the mob/gangster genre. All star cast with a well balanced story line of riches and woes from the perspective of an insider.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Had the weather channel before but had to remove it since it was not always working properly. Using this one for now.
0553801473|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a complete butt, BUT he writes amazing stories with interweaving plot lines and many surprises. Shipping was quick and item as described.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game its very entertaining however its just not enough levels there are only 9 levels. it would be great if they can add more to keep my attention.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I Loved this book!  I found myself not being able to turn the pages fast enough. A great love story!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|We did not love the movie. Slow in parts and the tiny screen was annoying. I love James Franco but this was disappointing.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|Humorous and touching love story. Whoopi Goldberg is great most of the time; just wish she didn't get TOO silly as in the scene at the bank.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great love story. Realistic love story with normal scenarios that gives it thrill and excitement. Love the characters development and their struggle to their happy ending.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Nice story of different women and how a pregnancy (unexpected, unexpected miracle and adoption) affects their very different lives. Interesting to see various perspectives. Funny at times, too silly other times but heartwarming in many ways.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Both of my boys ignore there regular alarm clocks. THis one seems to get their attention though. Very loud and visible.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Interesting and sad story. It did me good to become more aware of going on in Africa and the suffering of those people. Leo is awesome; I guess his accent is OK; I wouldn't really know but it seems to fit well in the story and his acting is great.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I had the free one and enjoyed it now and then... But now I have the Full version and we use it to keep our new puppy calm when we crate him and. I use it to relax on a work break... We love it!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Heartwarming to see how an old racist can be turned around by an extraordinary Asian girl and her brother (whomever played the role of the girl was awesome as was her character). I don't really like seeing Clint getting old but...happens to the best of us  :-) and he does it well.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Like all the other Dr. Panda games, my daughter loves this. So far her favorite parts are collecting the carts, mopping the floor, and sorting the money. She likes the rest of the game too, those are just what she always asks to do.
0783230370|5.0|This movie is unrealistically very funny and educational all at the same time. I love it. It arrived quickly and in mint condition. Thank you very much.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|The animation is truly amazing.  I think they did a great job with this movie, very impressive to see how they transformed the book into a film. .
B0006GANOQ|5.0|An all time classic at my house. A big hit with everyone in my family. Action packed, with a bit of romance and a crazy person on the loose. I loved it. Very happy with it. Thank you.
0425263924|5.0|I Just love it, but i would like more, i hope is not the end, i'm looking foward to read more, and then made my own conclutions ...
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I love this game, kept me up all hours of the night.  I just wish it was a little easier to navigate.  Other than that, it is great!  Can't wait for sequel to come out and hope it's just as fun as the first one..love G5 games!
1781162646|5.0|I loved looking into the behind scenes of an amusement park Stephan King is a wonderful story teller and this story captivated from beginning to end!
B00004RCKT|1.0|I have saw the movie a long time ago it was good but the one I just bought did not play
B000VMFDW2|5.0|A straightforward, authentic account documenting the brutality of two major battles during the Pacific campaign. Necessary reading for WWII historian.
0393327655|5.0|Excellent read. I came to it just recently and wish I had read it years earlier. The follow-up to this is also a great read. Are there parts that make you scratch your head? Yes. Are you going to agree, verbatim, with all that is written? probably not. Would I recommend it to both atheist and \\"believers\\"? yes. Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens and Daniels are the \\"new atheist\\", well new to me as I am new to atheism, and I feel like atheism is in good hands.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I have loved Joe since the beginning....His Signature CD was pure perfection, therefore I was nervous about this one. I listened to every single song and for the most part like all of them. Now I do have my favorites, Mary Jane being one of them. The metaphors and the instrumentals are the perfect mix. Once again Joe has delivered pure satisfaction with a \\"boot knocking\\", slow grind, for adults only CD.
0770437400|3.0|I was told that the book was amazing but the truth is it is average at best. The book did nothing special but was rather a more generic episodic tale.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, including the expansion for zombies.  I played the whole thing through without the need to purchase any additional content (except the expansion level, which was well worth the money after beating the normal levels).  It is difficult enough to keep you challenged, but not so hard that it is impossible to beat.  Once you beat all the levels on the hardest setting, you get to play with &#34;cheat&#34; modes which are also entertaining.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this app to anyone who enjoys strategic games and likes a challenge.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, one of the best sports movies ever made!  Highly recommend it.  Never a dull moment and you will love it to the very end!
B007N85ZXY|5.0|He loved it, guess it's one of the better albums that Neil has come out with in a while. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been hacked by a werido who I will find and have a word with. looking forward to this sooo much
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great family movie and a great story line.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Very well done and would watch again.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|This book reads as if Rafa wrote it himself unlike many of the other sport biographies.  Rafa comes across as an exceptionally nice guy with the fight of a lion.  He is a remarkably player and his story must be read.
0007466064|5.0|This is such a fantastic series of books.  Martin has such a creative mind, I watch the HBO series too.
159463176X|5.0|Loved this book, great story covering three generations.  Difficult for me to understand the poverty that would lead to selling a daughter. Read THE KITE RUNNER and thought it was wonderful as well.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It was a nice game but sometimes there are so many steps with no puzzle too them. it's not bad but ive played better.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Growing up, my family never played frightening movies. A few cartoons scared me as a child but this was my first real introduction into \\"scary movies\\". It definitely made an impact on me and my imagination!<br /><br />When I was in middle school, my friend would throw Halloween Parties in a house that was apparently haunted. Before we went to sleep the first year she pulled out her Poltergeist DVD and informed us this was one of her favorites from her childhood.<br /><br />The movie starts out illustrating a family who lives in an innocent suburb where nothing really ever happens. But the mood gradually starts to change as their daughter begins to make communication with \\"tv people\\" and eventually sucks her into their world. The transition between normal and different is done effectively and all of the main family character's acting is convincing, the mother's in particular. I was really moved by her crying for her daughter.<br /><br />The next Halloween party was fun, we watched The Ring, but it didn't nearly have the impact that Poltergeist had on me. I am not sure if I can find the correct words to explain why but it is just so well executed and balanced between horror and humor. It just really made a connection with me.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in ghosts, the afterlife, or just Steven Spielberg and his films!
159514188X|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone I know, especially those that deal with emotional issues. It just goes to show that you never know who that one person that cares might be. No matter what someone loves you!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|a verry good story with excellent characters and nail biting drama to the very end, a really good read, reccomended
014241543X|5.0|I am currently reading this and it pulls you in. It's like a movie playing in my head. Great book and I will be reading more from Gayle Forman!
B000067CPX|5.0|I had this cd when I lived over seas and left it there when I moved back to the states, plays great
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is a must see for adults and teenagers.  The story keeps you guessing and the ending is surprising.  It's a movie you have to watch more than once.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|When I got this app, I thought it was going to be pretty good, but then I played it and it was, the first time! After that, it is pretty much the same thing every time. It gets really boring after a while.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This is a great product, it works for the purpose I needed it for and I would reccomend it to others.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is so much more interesting than bejeweled. love the different types of the game.<br />fast moving and very engaging.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had fun working through the levels. You have to do things in a specific order. Definitely worth getting this app
B00004U45G|5.0|Has to be one of the best live albums of all time.  I like to listen to it while I clean my garage and when I drive my car.  Sometimes I park my car in my garage and listen to it while I clean my car IN THE GARAGE....MIND BLOWN!!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Outstanding all around family movie , laughing during the whole movie, the best stars chosen for and can't wait for a sequel .
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Nothing else compares.  You stay glued to your seat for the duration of each episode.  Highly recommend it if you like sci-fi, thrillers, or a good mystery.
0553582038|4.0|I love this series, the characters, the story line, the mystical elements.  So far this book was my least favorite.  There is an enormous number of characters and it becomes even more difficult to keep track of who is who. This book in the series focuses on Cersie, Brienne, Jamie, Samwell, and Ayra.  Tyrion, Dani and Jon Snow are awaiting in the Dance with Dragons.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|This will not load on my kindle.  stuck @ 4%.  makes all other apps and Internet run slowly.  and it won't allow me to delete it.  grrrrrr.......
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have been enjoying playing this game so far. it hasn't frozen or not started. good graphics for a slider and music and sounds are great.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app I already had on my smartphone and have added to my new Kindle Fire tablet - it is very clearly structured and easy to use. If I wanted to be really nit-picky, it would be nice to be able to format the auto signature in the same way as you can on PC but you can't have everything!
B00BWDJILG|5.0|I keep catching myself wondering &#34;who is that playing that song&#34; when one from this album pops up on my iPad or WCLK. Excellent saxophone work and sensitive renditions of great songs in the tradition of 'mainstream' jazz. I especially like &#34;Lush LIfe&#34; and &#34;Stardust.&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't know many kids (including me) who aren't addicted. It is the coolest game and after I get pocket editor I will rate it 6 stars . Right<br />now it's on discount price! FYI I ain't hired by mojang
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I recommend this app to all, it is an one of a kind thing.why did I wait?don't make the mistake I did,get the app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters interactions are beautifully written.  The setting is early 1900's and there are very few shows produced in this era.  Love the character development and plots.  Engaging even for this 50 year old male.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Enjoyed the development of the characters and the way things were finally working out.  What is wrong with a little taste of happilly ever after?  UGH!  So mad at the developments that we might boycott season 4!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is great totally surprising. I love Andy Whitfield, he was terrific. I had to have a copy of this DVD
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved the game but there's only ten levels to play, then you have to wait for more. I finished the first ten within an hour! PLEASE GET MORE LEVELS PRONTO!!!!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Sorry, but we thought we'd try this since reading the book was so slow, but this proved to be not much better. Oh well,  probably suited for those who know why this series is so popular!
B001AITH50|4.0|the movie was much better than queen of the damned. and it follows the book a lot more as well. however it is not at the level of an all time great movie. i is a sure watch B ranked movie and a good way to kill time.
B0091VTISO|3.0|It was very interesting was what it was. I enjoyed myself. I would watch it your into Conan films. I hate having to write reviews... It actually lowered the stars
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|Very entertaining. Great performances by everyone. So much better than 2013 version. Excellent &#34;date night&#34; movie that men and women can enjoy at the same time.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|So glad I bought it, I have shared it with friends and neighbors.What a classic! They all have really enjoyed it.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|A very interesting and entertaining documentary about one of America's best singing-songwriting bands. While the DVD of the live show in DC in 1977 is very good, it could have been better. For starters, after watching the documentary DVDs one gets the sense that the songs are all out of order. But what is really disappointing is the absence so many of the songs from Hotel California. The title track and &#34;New Kid in Town&#34; are the only two songs that made it on the DVD.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids and I like these types of games as they are addictive.  This game is very cute with great features.  However I am tired off all these games with the in app purchases. I wish there was a way to just own the game without having to purchase acorns.  Other than that this game is cute and a good way to pass the time.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|I was not expecting this movie to end the way it did. Very good movie I would highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Can't wait to see how this series is made into a movie. I have and will keep telling people to read it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like cuz u can scroll down ur notifications instead of going to options and then to device and then scroll down but u have to turn notififcations on
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love love love this game a lot, I play them very often must every day and night. I know other people would love them too.<br />Thank you so much.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is extremely fun! Especially once you get the hang of it. It is totally addictive for all ages..
B003INBNXO|5.0|I stumbled on this one and now realize that it's one of the best martial arts movies I've ever seen (just under Enter the Dragon). I recommend it for anyone interest in this genre.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This app is great! Gets your brain working with all excitement and fun of mystery<br />.I would most likely play the next one they come out with great app
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter ordered this game for her Kindle an she loves it. It's a great way for her to pass the time, like during road trips or when we are waiting at places like a doctor's office etc.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This game is pretty fun and I enjoyed giving &quot;clients&quot; make overs......I recommend u get the game.........and its free a deal breaker
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I don't know how to get started so that I can use it.  I have tried everything that I know.  I will have to ask someone to set it up for me.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Easy to read, but quite little believable: e.g. the main character is very moral person despite being a hit man.
B006X415GK|5.0|Love her color. Just started collecting different dolls n I really like these along with the Pullip's. Wish they had these BJD's when I was younger.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|zzz, ,z ,,z,zz,  oh, sorry, excuse me, I was sleeping...<br /><br />Slow-moving, lame characters, and lame plot..z  z..z..<br /><br />By the end of the movie I didn't care if she turned evil or not, I was just glad it was near the end.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I bought this watch with the intention of using it for a dive watch and mixing it in with my day-to-day watches.  I find myself wearing it more often than not, and enjoy the easy function of the chronograph, etc.  I was concerned with screw in controls but had no issue after a day at the pool and several days at the beach.  I'm going diving this weekend but don't anticipate any issues there either.  The glow in the dark markings are really bright and easy to see, too.  May consider the rubber Seiko strap later as the polished band almost looks too nice to scratch up diving.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Solid acting. Believable, strong female and male characters. Scripts that are not stupid. Thoughtful plot development across episodes. Cool tech. Scary aliens. Small unit military.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game seemed like it would have been a lot of fun, but it froze my kindle fire twice within the first thirty minutes and I had to force restart. I would try to play again if the freezing was fixed.
0151008116|5.0|One of the best books ever written.  Definitely a classic, bring on Richard Parker and all the magic of the life of Pi.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Get this app. I love  it and so does my sister. Get all the angry birds<br />app's let's go angry birds.<br />.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Good movie for 6year old boy. Not very interesting to me, but understood premise of the movie. Hope there is not a sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very fun to pass the time, no glitches that i have seen in the hours of play that i have done, highly recomended
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use Ebay a lot for purchasing gifts, yard items, and household items. I always get fast service and have never disliked anything purchased. I love the ease and convenience of this app and would recommend it to anyone who likes to purchase from Ebay.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|great fun, unfortunatly trial ended and i will have to puchase it to finnish, i hope it will be worth it
B00B7ERH04|5.0|I wanted to have a photo timer for taking pics and I was afraid I couldn't find that. So I searched it and I found funtastic. I love it. This is a must buy app
B009KS4XRO|2.0|VERY HARD TO GET BINGO POINTS AND SPARE KEYS.  SHOULD OFFER EXTRAS ON A DAILY BASIS WITHOUT HAVING TO 'BUY' THEM.
1781162646|5.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King from the time both \\"Carrie\\" and Salem's Lot\\" were published, and read faithfully all of his books, until they began to take on such heft that I was afraid to break a toe if I dropped one on my foot! I made an exception for the Dark Tower series, but that was all.<br /><br /> Now Mr. King has returned (if even for a short while) to writing a book that can be held comfortably in the hand, without danger to any extremity. Not to mention that it's an excellent book, extremely well written and quite engrossing.<br /><br /> The narrator of the book is a 60 something man looking back to when he was 21 and spent a summer working at Joyland, a very small scale Disney-type attraction in North Carolina. There's a House of Horrors in which, several years before, a young girl was murdered in quite a brutal fashion, and there is a rumor that she can be seen inside the ride, but not by everyone.<br /><br /> As a typical King story, there are elements of the supernatural, but they're not heavy-handed. He also puts in the book some kind gestures and a penchant for showing how good people can help other good people.<br /><br /> The ending is quite exciting, taking place on the Ferris wheel in the park, during a driving storm. Everything turns out fairly well, and the reader can be satisfied that Mr. King has, once again, delivered a readable book, and a light one, also!
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|My 5 year old girls LOVE playing this game!  Even after I showed them a few additional tips, they were able to pick up on it even better.  You can play again 1 to 3 other people or computer-players.
B00364K6YW|5.0|It came up to expectations but there were a few bits missing  but there were also bits put in that we had not seen before on the whole<br />it was enjoyable
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked the plot and the twist.  Definitely a good courtroom beach read.  The author was somewhat sophomoric with his character development and he failed to establish the razor's edge type of tension that comes with the best of thrillers.  Still, there was enough in the plot to hold my interest and Landay gets credit for not becoming overly self absorbed in his prose. A clear 3.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so amazing and full of love and excitement! I can't wait to read the second one! I finished this one in two days!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I've never been a fan of murder mysteries, but since I like the Longmire TV series so much, I figured I'd give the first novel a try.  I'm hooked!  Can't wait to read the next one.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|If you like Nat King Cole standards then this George Benson tribute is for you. Benson admits to being a great admirer of Cole and it certainly shows. His interpretations and sympathetic and melodic. Benson's variations never lose the Cole flavour. In short, a listening pleasure.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|This game is a lot more difficult than I expected and will take me awhile to conquer it. Love the 3D images
B0086700CM|5.0|If I had ten hands than they will all be up to show how well developed this game is...I will recommend this to friends ans family...Thank you creators!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|VERY INTRIGUING GAME . @Times made my mind work harder that simple hidden object games. Would recommend. Fun for all ages
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Just a lovely book that details the literal and emotional journey of Harold and his wife, Maureen. As Harold trudges the English countryside he contemplates his past actions and perceived failures. He finds himself lacking on so many fronts. At the same time his wife (who has been left at home) is reflecting on her part in what has become a stale and lifeless marriage.<br /><br />The book is quite slow paced, almost meandering, (just like Harold's journey) but never tired or boring. It is quite an interesting and thought provoking read about how challenging oneself, helping others and accepting help, can bring so much in the form of greater personal rewards and insight.<br /><br />But the storyline does seem to lose itself towards the middle. Up until this point it felt as if Harold's reactions and the circumstances he finds himself in could almost be real. And although Harold's feelings remain authentic throughout, the situations become almost summarised, and the characters unconvincing. And after his epic journey, his reactions and dialogue seemed stilted - almost as if what he had learned along the way had been forgotten.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book, looked forward to each chapter, and finding out how Harold fared with each encounter. I would recommend to anyone who loves a book with character insight.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun, a little challenging and completely addictive. Can spend hours playing it and have had no issues with the game not working.
B00123IAHO|5.0|Curtis Maaaaan! The Man Got talent! Back then...to do a whole movie soundtrack was effortless...now a soundtrack is more of a compilation. Great album!
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a terrific science fiction book about a young boy who was monitored by a device that was put on his neck. He was monitored for his intelligence to prove if he was a genius and could save the world. Ender or Andrew, his real name had a family: Valentine his sister which he adored, his brother Peter which he would never want to be like and despised him, along with his loving mother and father. Ender was watched carefully until one day Colonel Graff come to their home and said Ender was chosen to go to Battle School because the school feels he is the one to save the world. Ender went through a series of training to win against the \\"buggers\\" which are aliens. A battle between his home plant of earth and an alien planet. This book is easy to read and you just cant hardly put it down. It draws you in with great detail to make you feel like you are right there with Ender. My son would really enjoy this book  because it would take him on a Si fi exploration into another world, and I would recommend it for all readers who love a science fiction book. I would give this book five out of five stars because it just draws you in to its fantasy of the science fiction world. Later this year there will be a movie coming out based on the book Ender's Game. I am looking forward to it coming out and I hope the movie captures this good book.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Get this app, it's the best!!!! So entertaining and has awesome sound effects and looks really cool. It's totally worth it
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is awsome! I recomend this to anyone who likes adventure! Its fun and enjoyable, even my picky sister likes this game!
0307279189|5.0|I loved this book! The stories were interesting and at times thrilling. I loved knowing that these were all real people used in the book and the endurance and love for running these people had was inspiring. I have never really &#34;been a runner&#34;, but this book definitely made me want to get out there and try it out, testing out the correct form and all and see if it works for me!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, I play it everyday! My boyfriend loves it also. We will play right beside eachother 24/7.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Seeing a movie, I always want to find out if there is a book that came before, therefore I can see how the book is different and if I even like it better. Being in the musical before I loved the storyline and so I thought I would try out the book. It started out a little slow but it soon became captivating. I truly enjoyed it, and finding the differences between all the different mediums.
B00CW665VI|5.0|To say I really liked this book would be an understatement. I freaking loved it! I have had my eye on it for a while now, and finally took the plunge to read it. It was just what I needed! The whole story, coming from a guys point of view? Hilarious and amazing. Drew is cocky, which I usually hate in a guy, but he knows it himself, so that makes it okay. He's loyal (huge points there), and he's a hard worker. Overall? Kinda perfect. Kate is feisty, yet a little tiny bit insecure. Put both their personalities together and you have something great! The bantering they share, the connection they have, it's all perfect.<br /><br />Reading a book from a guys point of view is different, and I can imagine writing one (as a woman) is crazy hard. However, Emma Chase manages to pull it off with perfection. I am so happy I took the time to read this book. If Emma writes more books like Tangled, I'll be buying them instantly!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book. With a box of tissues. Not because it's sappy, but because it's true.  Each of us is an Auggie in our own way. But more importantly, we need to see, accept, and celebrate all the Auggies in the world.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm part way into part 3.  First of all I reread Book 2, just to draw out the suspense, I've been holding my breath for the third in the trilogy. I shouldn't have bothered. More premature ejaculations than you can shake a stick at (what's with that? pressing up against her and coming in his clothes? Or pressing slightly into her and coming - and then again (surprise surprise) seconds later?  I know it's fiction, and fictional lovers can come at the click of a mouse, but seriously, IRL husbands have been cuckolded for less). Very little in the way of plot development so far. And now I've discovered this is not in fact the end of the 'trilogy\\" ... well, I won't be buying the rest of them.<br /><br />REVISION: I am revising this review. While I still feel ripped off that this is not the end of the trilogy, this book is happily meaty (not novella-like as some have said), and although it meanders somewhat, it delivers on the intense \\"I've only known you for a week but an entire soap opera has happened\\", and the non stop hot sex. Would I buy the next two?  I suppose it depends on my mood, I cannot imagine rereading this one to catch up on the story again.  It's  not Lord of the Rings.
B002MG2ATY|3.0|the acting was excellent as was the recreation of events. Did not appreciate the language though I realize it was probably accurate for the time and situations.
B00417HV14|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is a fantastic guitarist.  This album features both rock and blues, with a cameo by Eric Clapton.  Joe has been playing before audiences since he was 10 or 12, and it shows!
B000I9UA8U|5.0|Slow start like lots of british films but the fun builds up to the full monty. Not for young folks.
0316069485|5.0|The Reversal(A Lincoln Lawyer Novel) book # 3 in the Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller series and it is a page turner. Great surprise near the end that will rock the boat. Even better get the audio book to go along with the book ! Can't wait to read the rest.
B000ICXQF6|4.0|Twists and turns keep it interesting even though it gets a little hard to follow. Not for the faint at heart.
B0059WTMLW|1.0|This is sudoku at it's (next to) worst. I've played one that was harder to use and figure out. The challenge is supposed to be getting the right numbers in the squares, not figuring out how to get the numbers in the squares, and keep the colors from changing and keep the numbers from changing themselves, just a really weird design.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this game and it helped me learn how to play magic you just have to buy the full version and that is $10.00 wow ive seen expensive games but this comes at top. great game otherwise
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing.<br />A book I could not stay away from.<br />My heart is still writhing in anticipation of the next in the series.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It is not that great but pretty fun!!!! The quest itself is too short. I expected it to be just like a Mario game but was disappointed....
B00821OX98|5.0|A very engaging series, feeling more in-tune with 'V' of the 1980's than the recent re-boot did.<br /><br />The ensemble cast gets the job done nicely, along with decent guest-stars.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The book is non-stop action of one sort or another.  A real page turner.  Short chapters with each chapter continuing the throught process of the previous one really keeps one's intersest.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Ok i'm not gonna review or tell you guys about the movie, because as the review title said it's really enjoying to watch the movie over and over,so i'm gonna review the bonus feature. I think the bonus feature are too short and not so great, like the making of the movie was too short although it's fun to know how they got the idea and so on. Deleted scene was very disappointed, i'm glad it's deleted (my opinion). Video game commercial section kinda nice but really really short. Overall if you expect more from the bonus feature, don't count on it, if you really like the movie itself than buy it, cause it has the 3d version.<br />Thank you for your attention
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|please make anothher I beet this one allready I love cut the rope and I want more please I beg make a new or add more levels to this cut the rope or the other 2 cut the ropes this is the best game ever. it was abliutly worth the money I payed for I would buy it any time it comes out ill spend hours getting 3 stars on every level and so far in every game I have 3 stars I love cut the rope so thanks for making it
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I downloaded the movie expecting to watch it with my kids. I always watch the movie before I let my kids watch. The movie is pretty good. Starts off slow and continues at that pace but you would not get bored even for a minute. There is a heavy use of bad words and some adult content and nudity too hence would not consider it as a family movie.
B00355L2TU|4.0|Never thought I'd say working out was fun, but this workout actually kind of is. I like that it's faster paced and keeps me moving. It's especially helpful since my time is limited and usually have to work out in the mornings. The quick pace keeps me from falling asleep.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is always fun keeping up with the family. There are many high school friends that are keeping in touch through Facebook.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Paul's solo material has largely been overlooked and because of the Beatles.  There's always been something special about the flow and vibe of this album to me.  I first heard it on vinyl about 8 years ago and fell in love with it immediately.  If you're just a casual Paul McCartney fan this is the album to get as it has a taste of everything.  Or, if you're looking to get introduced to his career after the Beatles this is also the album to get.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This was a great game for a day, very addicting and fun. The next day it's slow to load, then it won't load at all. I've tried for three days to get back into it and even deleted and reloaded the app and it still won't load and gets a connection/content won't load error every time. I'm giving up on this pile of tyranosur fecal matter.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The book was very enjoyable. I loved the series.  Very well written.  The quality of service was great.  I am looking forward to the next set.
B006RXQ800|4.0|An exceptional performance by an exceptional actor. Leonardo DiCaprio can't even ruin this film. Bravo for sharp work. New York, New York!<br /><br />However, there was quite a brushover related to racist elements, especially of targeted violence against black folks. When the black kid that ran with the Dead Rabbits gets killed by the mob, it is given the paucity of breath between gunshots and erstwhile exciting homicides. Maybe someday someone will bother to include black folks as something other than an also-ran in a picture meant to be snapshot of the times. However, don't hold your breath.<br /><br />Nevertheless, good work for folks operating on a myopic vision.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Action Packed with bits of comedy. Very Entertaining. Creative chase scenes. Similar to Arnolds other movies. Good special effects. Decent plot. Fun movie to watch.
B001CZVVWI|3.0|Signor Figaro is not very enthusiastic, more or less he looks like he wants to get out of the stage as soon as the opera is over... and Count Almaviva tries too hard, but I don't think he did a great job.... Overall, beautiful modern stage to look at and entertaining.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I can almost forget how good it is, until I watch an episode and then I am reminded all over, what a great show with real character development, it is.
0385347774|5.0|wonderful book ... lots of unexpected twists. I am still reading it and am excited to see how the book ends!
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book has forever change me as a spirit, as I continue on my soul's path. I am humble, and grateful for all of the cases for sharing a part of their soul's plan with the world in this spiritual agreement of universal healing.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've got this blu-ray and view 10 times!!!<br /><br />It Supplement is perfect, and DVD is also good.<br />Blu-ray is very good quality and I've got all song.
B000002OMN|4.0|Imagine you are a naive forest dweller.  You know not the complicated things in life.  Your life is tranquil and serene.  Then a gearhead with a monster truck pulls up, ripping apart the greenery that surrounds you and crushing all the cute animals making red stains all over your nice forest floor.  This is when you have an epiphany...  your life was obviously boring.  You jump onto that truck and ride off with that guy drinking beer into the sunset.  This is what that album will do to you.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I haven't read the books so I was unfamiliar with the movie.  I really enjoyed the drama and action between the characters.  I didn't know that it was a survival movie about kids killing other kids in order to survive.  It's a good movie or rather example of social experiment of the haves and have nots.  I look forward to the next movies in the series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is outstanding and should enjoy a long run.  It holds me mesmerized and spellbound!! I hated to see Matthew go as he was one of my favorite characters.  It just goes to show that we should grab our happiness when we can...
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie has a lot of young talent in it. It is very silly and very entertaining. I rented it to watch Rebel Wilson. She is hilarious!
B005ZV8Q2S|1.0|I enjoy both actors very much, it was massive amounts of F-bombs and profanity in general that turned me off.
B004529NKC|4.0|I was happy to see the characters from Step Up 2 return here to dance. The storyline was okay. The dancing was truly phenomenal.
B008Y73940|3.0|Good if nothing else available. Little bit of mystery element, not too deep. Good for those nights one feels like laying around.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I first saw this film in the IMAX -- great experience. Christian Bale is always stellar. The film is a bit long, but that just means more value for your money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I stumbled across this game not knowing what to expect. I can say it refreshingly fun and thought provoking.....fun fun fun
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I did not finish watching this film. It definitely was not made for my demographic -- female over 40. My 20-year-old son loved it.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Very impressed with this album!  This is one of those albums I can enjoy cover to cover and never skip a song.  I would highly recommend you listen to Imagine Dragons!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I use this app to fix red eye and blemishes in my phone photos, it's fantastic. It is very easy to use, and has tons of features.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Biographies can be tough. Life retold is not chronological and it can be difficult to follow an author skipping forward and back through time and feel as a reader one really knows this person being written about. Isaacson did a good job overall at this. I formed a real attachment to Steve through the pages, an admiration for his tenacity and focus.. a little less for Steve's harshness. In the end I didn't want the story to end and I've since resurrected all my Apple products, each that cannabalized the next, just to have a little more time with the ideas that gave them life.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|These tracks are of the finest quality that very much adds to<br />the continued collection of this soundtrack series. Cannot wait for a new<br />album!
1608955702|4.0|What I like is that the book is not overly complicated.  The examples are great.  If you want to get better this is a good product to help you out.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This is great, good fun. In fact, I think I will watch all three movies again and again. A perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of Roswell.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Enjoyed it.I like old classics and this one I think is a good one to read if you are into them.  I wanted to read the classics so this is one of the old ones.  I think  you may like it.
B005DZMODI|4.0|No music critic, I, but I love this album. The Blues suite me at this time in life, and especially the Blues as presented by these artists.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Comedy is not the word I would have used to describe this movie.  Sure, it has a few amusing moments, and I realize that when someone uses the phrase \\"black comedy\\", it's different than \\"comedy\\", but still ... this is not that movie.<br /><br />This is not a movie to feel good about, it's not a life change moment movie, it's not a lesson learned movie.  The main character starts out unlikable, immature, self-absorbed, and ends the same way.  There are some seriously uncomfortable and even ugly moments, where I was happy that I had some paper-work to do while watching.<br /><br />What is interesting, and why I gave it four stars, is that I really enjoyed the way the story was portrayed.  Real circumstances, lines, attitudes; everything is believable.  I didn't have to sit through any cutesy little moments of slapstick, or \\"aww\\" romantic scenes, it was just an honest look at a real character.  What drives her, what she is going through, and what happens when she goes through the scenes played out in the movie.  I appreciated this movie for exactly what it was.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Not a big music critic here, I just love Bowie's voice and wish there were more of it, and less of the distractions of music which obscures it.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|I am halfway through this book and can already establish this is a great book.  Twice already I haven't been able to put it down for two hour stints.  This book has made me decide to read other books by Max Brooks,  totally suggest this to others who like action drama type reads.
B0084B0656|5.0|This was a great book. I love the way the author expresses his thoughts and reasoning. His examples are apt, and humorous as well. I wish I could remember all of his points, but that's why I intend to buy the book, so I can refer back to it. It is fascinating to see his progression from agnostic to orthodox believer in Christianity. Very encouraging.
0887081770|3.0|I remember reading this story to a first grade class.  They always loved it and became excited as the pages opened.  So I ordered it for my three year old grandson.  The book was so tiny that the drama of the pages unfolding was lost.  Very disappointing!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|There are so many beautiful and apt expressions and thoughts in this book, I will write them down as I read, or I won't remember them. I am only half way through this book so far. At times it is like reading poetry in prose.<br />&#34;Success is a hideous thing. Its false similarity to merit deceives men.&#34;<br />&#34;The past has a face, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us denounce the face and tear off the mask.&#34;<br />&#34;Superstitions, bigotries, hypocrisies, prejudices, these phantoms, phantoms though they be, cling to life; they have teeth and nails in their shadowy substance, and we must grapple with them individually and make war on them without truce; for it is one of humanities inevitabilities to be condemned to eternal struggle with phantoms. A shadow is hard to seize by the throat and dash to the ground.&#34;<br />&#34;Let us attack (the above phantoms), but let us distinguish. The characteristic of truth is never to run to excess. What need has she of exaggeration? Some things must be destroyed, and some things must be merely cleared up and investigated. What power there is in courteous and serious examination! Let us not carry flame where light alone will suffice.&#34;<br />There are many more, but enough. Read the book. I've finished now, and it just may be the best book I've ever read.
B0052RCX0G|4.0|Reading this book is like taking a tour of the British Museum. The author presents 100 objects from the British Museum and presents their stories and their significance in world history. The objects are presented in roughly historical order and also grouped according to several themes, and the author points out some common threads that are woven through this history.<br /><br />One of the best parts of reading this book is encountering little-known facts, people, and cultural artifacts which one doesn't usually find in a textbook-style presentation of world history.<br /><br />Overall I found this to be a very enjoyable read, easy to pick up and put down again, and I tended to read this during spare moments or a few chapters in the evening after work.<br /><br />Perhaps the only \\"weakness\\" of this book is that as the book moves from object to object, there is not necessarily a coherent story line, and so I did not tend to feel drawn on to the next chapter.<br /><br />Note also that the pictures in this book are in nice, high-resolution color. (Of course, not all Kindle models can display color.)
0062255657|5.0|A story of a man who returns to his childhood home and is confronted with memories and perceptions he is unsure of; with a generous splash of fantasy thrown in and stirred. A mesmerizing tale which I couldn't put down. I was immersed in it until the end. It was lilting, lovely and very disturbing. Somehow, even in the most uncomfortable bits of the story, it felt safe. As though someone was holding my hand.
B004GYY714|5.0|After using this ap for several weeks I think this ap is great. Power consumption is very low and most any station or genre you are looking for can be found. Give this ap a shot, you will like it.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold maintains her stellar level of imagination in this story set a few years before &#34;Cryoburn.&#34; It stars Miles's feckless cousin Ivan Vorpatril and a Whole family of twisty Jacksonian nabobs on the run from a hostile takeover.<br /><br />But Ivan is 34 and an Ops officer now, so he gets pulled in to help rescue - or control? - the ever-ingenious Baron and Baronne Arqua and their multitalented, multicolored brood.<br /><br />Add in our favorite decadent Byerly Vorrutyer, a haut woman survivor of the Cetagandan occupation a hundred years ago, and bins of fabulously valuable historical papers and you see why Bujold has that stack of Hugos and Nebulas.<br /><br />There's a dandy fungus too. The Fungus That Undermined - but read it and see.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I absolutely love this cable TV production.  I have the first season and am looking forward to acquiring the second season.  This show is not all about zombies as much as it is about how the characters interact with each other.  It is about how they get along.  It has been hard to see a few of the characters get killed but there are new people coming into the show all the time.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Bought it because my VHS tapes are starting to wear out. Now that my 17 year old is all grow up I need to upgrade so my 3 year old and 3 month old can become disney fans too!

B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I enjoyed the movie...I found the dialogue at times flowery and tough to follow, but as a whole it is a very good movie.  Intriguing in that we know politics is shady nowadays, but don't consider that it could have been such in Lincoln's time as well.  Seeing quiet promises and deals made to get things done is an interesting concept!

B00B81B0HC|4.0|I have a feeling this is one of those albums I'll listen to obsessively for a couple of weeks, and be tired of thereafter. Imagine Dragons does seem to do a good job of balancing a sampling of catchy styles with &#34;dark&#34; moody alternative themes. Terrific for a tumultuous summer romance up until you realize you aren't the only girl he shows his demons to.
B006WXHJNU|4.0|In my opinion, Edward Norton is the reason to watch this movie.  The original \\"Hulk\\" was mediocre and grossly over encumbered by cheesy transitions which attempted to give it a comic book style but did little more than shatter immersion.<br /><br />This second, improved pseudo sequel, however, is an excellent example of how super hero movies can and ought to be done.  Norton delivers an excellent performance (which is expected of an actor of his caliber).  He fits the role of Dr. Banner wonderfully and convincingly.  The plot of the movie is solid albeit expected given Banner's character.  Banner doesn't want the Hulk to be released, the military pursues him, shenanigans ensue.  That being said, the movie is definitely enjoyable assuming you can suspend your desire for the dead-pan serious and Oscar winning writing.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is what it is.  A fun, action filled, visual feast based off of a comic book targeted at the mass market.  The story is not incredibly deep, there are not any major earth shattering revelation, and you won't walk away from the movie a changed person.  It is, however, a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Despite the bad press, John Carter is a fantastic movie. The cinematography is first rate, and the clever framing sequence is a nice nod to the character's long literary heritage.<br /><br />If you liked Star Wars, you can thank John Carter<br /><br />If you liked Avatar, you can thank John Carter<br /><br />If you're a fan of Superman, or Flash Gordon, you can thank John Carter,<br /><br />And if you've ever read the original novels, to which we owe so much great fiction, then you owe it to yourself to see a film that tells a great story that the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />Three words: See This Movie!<br /><br />You won't regret it!<br /><br />Eric<br />Ypsilanti, MI
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It's so addicting and fun! It can be challenging at times and really makes you think.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book was somewhat depressing and definitely lacking in humor.  I am thinking that the movie has to be more entertaining than the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was excellent can't wait for the update hurry now I'm waiting okay you're not hurrying enough please hurry now
B007MDB71O|5.0|Although they changed too much from the original source material to suit me, this is still a wonderful film and does not deserve the negative press it has received.  The movie is as good an action/science fiction flick as has been released in recent years.  If you have any interest in science fiction, or just great action, then you owe it to yourself to watch this film.<br /><br />If you are a fan of science fiction, this is where it all started.  The original book this movie was based on was published in 1912 and nearly every science fiction/fantasy book/film since has been influenced by it.  Heck, even Superman was influenced by John Carter's superhuman abilities while on Mars.<br /><br />This movie was not marketed properly by Disney, but that is not the movie's fault.  The movie, taken on its own merits, is a great example of a fun science fiction film and deserves to be in everyone's top list of these kinds of films.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B006N0YWGY|3.0|I found this to be insanely hard.  I would like it better if the throttle wasn't full on all the time.  The addition of the buying and selling adds a bit of novelty.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazon.com's Temple Run 2 was amazing and exhilarating. My grandson loves this game and he is only two years old. In fact he plays the game better than I do. I am so glad we purchase this game from Amazon.com I will purchase many more games from Amazon.com.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|Works very well for offline use. Documentation is rather sparse, though. Small app size does not include size of maps.
B000059MEK|5.0|This album has a large amount of classic Daft Punk tracks. You can listen to it and each time pick up new nuances. It is truly a masterpiece.
0553801473|5.0|Excellent -- five books with no let up in quality and excitement! Just read and enjoy and experience it. Some of the last chapters were devastating. Can't wait for number six!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Lep's World was fun, it was like playing mario world! Then i got to a certain level and it glitched on me and wouldn't work again. Lep would fall off the ledge and die, making me angry and not able to play the game on my kindle.
8866137634|1.0|Pages are too thin - ink runs onto other side.  I think I also should be rated a 1-star for thinking that in 2013 I should be putting stickers onto a notepad and then taking a picture of it.  I'm an idiot and so is moleskin for marketing this.  Save your money.  If you have to physically write something out, get a good daily planner.
B00005KAQP|5.0|I have no complaints with this DVD, although purchasing online can be nerve-racking sometimes, this time it worked out great!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This will get your knife sharp. It will not get it sharp like a razor, but very sharp. Its small and handy to have around when all you need to do is give your knife a quick tune up. Great for hiking and backpacking. Its so light, that there is no excuse not to take it with you.
B007WOFXB8|5.0|Great package, I finished by adding the other five of the first ten. Have several ZZ Top ,including albums of pre-ZZ Top.Thanks
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|For the price, I was expecting better. The voices of the characters are not correct, some of the dolls won't stand, the heads fall off easily. Mattel should have done a better job.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Different and interesting, good creative summer read. The language and story arc are not perfect but i can visualize that<br />Circus!
B0063M22QO|4.0|a fun and challenging game that gets more intense each level.  helps keep the mind sharp and focused with each game.
0811876373|5.0|These cake pops are so cute! Bakerella does a great job of explaining how to decorate the pops, and this is a great selection of pop ideas. These have been a big hit with my immediate and extended family, and especially with the kids!
B003B02O14|4.0|Good read!  Always enjoy Grisham's books.  Read during vacation and completed in a couple of days.  Would recommend for anyone.
B004Z4LVZK|5.0|This was a fantastic book and influenced me to read the others in the series. The author is such a fantastic writer. This book pulls you in and you can't stop reading until you've finished the whole book! There are many \\"cliff hangers\\" at the end of chapters throughout the book. Love it.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|once you arrive on the Planet Pandora, you will never want to leave.<br />enjoy the journey, go out and design your own Avatar or yourself.<br /><br />have fun watching this story.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I liked Amy Winehouse but her life overtook her talent. This cd reminds you how great she was. The songs are a mix of styles due to it being released after her death but I love it.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I love this Trek movie, the best Director, the cast are perfect!<br /><br />what more does one need to say about this Trek Movie?
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is this generation's coming of age defining movie. It's destined to become a cult classic. Hopefully more people will see it.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is the best.  I am no techie and have a ton of fun with this game trying to elevate my score by maneuvering the shark to eat certain &#34;foods&#34;.  The graphics are amazing as you almost feel you are at the beach.  This is a must-have game.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|If you like atmospheric movies and action this is for you. The movie is violent and very stylish...and the music is amazing. A modern day cult classic.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Not one thing has been resolved now we wait again<br />This is completely stupid and I . Really liked this series
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Don't go by what the so called critics say about this album. If you give it a chance you will like it.
B00BV9S01U|5.0|This gets a five star because its nice to see how whitesnake began and how they developed their signature sound. from the early blues roots to the modern sound they have now its all good. so if your are a fan and like to track from beginning to end this is a great collection.
B0045XKJBI|1.0|I thought I was ordering the movie not the video on the computer.  I Pushed the wrong button on the order button and did not know you could even order a video on line.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Our family really enjoys the Ice Age movies, and this one did not disappoint!  Lots of laughing with just the right amount of excitement that does not frighten my children to the point of nightmares as other movies have done.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I currently have an iPhone 5. Previous phones were an assortment of Android phones. To begin, do yourself a favor and upgrade to an iPhone or get yourself am old Samsung Android phone (think original Galaxy S 1 or Droid Charge with the Wolfson DAC. This amp will NOT make the sound any better!! It's purpose is to boost the gain coming from your phone to various high impedance headphones. I currently own a set of Westone 4's and this amp compliments the iPhone perfectly! Incredibly low distortion and the battery gives me about 2 good solid days of travel (I fly a lot).<br /><br />If you're looking to 'gain' a little volume, this amp is for you!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've read better, not as great of a story line as I expected. An interesting perspective on S&M, one of the first widely popular books I've read depicting it in such detail.
145210655X|5.0|The humor in this book is spot on. Not really a book to read to your son at night but amazing none the less.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I bought this movie for a gift.  Then the recipient loaned it to me  becuase I hadn't seen it.  Very enjoyable.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Tempe Run is a great game.  The graphics are well done and the game is well designed.  You are given 3 objectives to work on and they become more difficult as you become better.  My  objection to this games is that occasionally is does not run properly on my Kindle Fire, even though I have it set at the lowest resolution.  It is frustrating to &#34;die&#34; because of tablet error.  But overall it it fun and challenging.
B002PQ7JQK|3.0|I am happy receiving the blu ray version of Star Trek Original Series.<br />I am just watching the very first episode.<br /><br />The only thing I want to mention is that I guess due to the fact it is so old, they could not manage to get it fit a bigger screen. I have a 58 TV and the picture of Star Trek misses like 10 cm on each side.<br />I also had to put up the volume on kinda the highest on my tv as the sound is quite low. If I would watch the episodes on a normal volume, I would not really hear much. The sound gets back to the old version sometimes. It has interruptions few times inbetween. So you get the old sound effect lots of time.<br /><br />So far, I am not disappointed in purchasing it. The picture quality is really fine for such an old TV Show.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a thriller that's actually unpredictable.  Along with the mystery itself, the book explores male-female dynamics with insight and dark humour e.g. differentiating between \\"husbandly capitulation\\" and \\"concord\\"; pointing out the masks of courtship \\"And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They're not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they're pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be\\"; describing in-laws who \\"could be around any corner, cherishing each other\\" and obsessive love \\"like the world's sweetest cancer, \\" and, more generally, there's talk of parenting, aging, recession, and media (in)justice.    If you like your mysteries or thrillers formulaic and reasonable, you will not like this.  If want to be surprised while you explore the underside of mankind by reading about both sides of one particular couple, read Gone Girl.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|You must read this if you are a cat lover. Funny, as in LOL funny! You will enjoy this book.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Sound quality is pretty impressive for the cost.  Decent, ergonomically speaking.  I got them on sale and they were quite a bargain.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As with the first two, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the next one! Just wish I knew how long it would be til it comes out.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I find it fun, only thing I don't like is in the beginning you have to use your penis to continue on with the game
B0093X805W|2.0|The last time I read this was in high school, although I saw it when I was a kid. I thought the book was okay, but I gave it a 2 because I think if you combined both movies you'd get more of the book then they ever showed. Also I loved all the different magical candy stories (my favorites are the minty grass, the blue robins egg with the pink sugar bird, and the chocolate castle/ although they could've told more about this in the book instead of just cutting the story short.) Like I think they could've used chocolate that didn't melt like the ice cream that didn't melt; that would've been cool. And Charlie could've met the kid (this is an add in) and hung out with him as his lifetime supply of chocolate prize. Also I think in the remake they could've shown these magical candies with computer graphics. I still think it's pretty cool though; and I had lots of fun reading the book, and I dug the pictures!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've just this past week found some spectacular gaming apps for my kindle fire HD. WHEN I GOT THE FIRST KINDLE FIRE, IT WAS RARE TO FIND A GAME THAT HAD ALL I'M LOOKING FOR LIKE THIS ONE SO READILY HAS:<br /><br />1. Stimulating game play 2. A Creative spin to it somehow 3. Exceptional graphics. 4. The ability to no matter the game, to create a social aspect to the games (social gaming made a boring farm game by Zynga exceptionally pleasing for a long time, too long lol. And that same effect is what makes candy saga fun on Facebook since there is no kindle fire Andriod version. Playing casual games that you would burn out on if not for friendly competition was a Facebook revolution. I wish the amazon gaming circle allowed my husband and to login and out! I wish for the full price of this game it used Amazon's gaming circle. BUT THE GAME IS GOOD.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love it have watched it so many times thought it was a real barging at the price first class condition
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy has and has always had the ability to keep you pinned to his books... This one keeps you NAILED. It's a great story with incredible and credible insight to imagined and yet may become real events...
034580404X|5.0|I am not much of a reader.  I have read 1 book in the last 5 years.  Several people had told me the series was good and each book got better.  I have read the series in just a month.  You want to have book 2 ready to start when you get done with book 1.  It is a great love story, and real shady.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Loved a Thousand Spendid Suns and Kit Runner. Both taught me much about life in the Middle East. I also come from a patriachal society and I understand how it works but this was an excellent eye opener to a more serious problem in a society that takes it to an extreme.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|YOU HAVE TO MAKE MORE LEVELS!!! This game is highly addicting. As soon as you start you won't wanna stop till you complete all the levels!!! MAKE MORE LEVELS!!!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I have to admit that for the price, I assumed 999 was going to be a game I could get a few hours of gameplay out of here and there when the mood struck me.<br />I completely underestimated how wonderful some games can be when they require you to think, rather than point and click.<br /><br />Not only that, but the replay value is phenomenal.<br />I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching Downton Abbey. It retains in it's third season everything I enjoyed about the first two seasons.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|this is one of a kink. i recommend each and every one to take the time and watch this movie
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Ap pulls up items but will not display pictures. Very slow did better when I went to ebay as a sight through internet than with mobile ap.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun but I wish that there was an unlimited mode. The extra game is fun. Sometimes it does get confusing of where you are supposed to go but the hints help a lot.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this novel. I read it in 2 days. Couldn't put it down! Very well written. Characters come very much alive. My friends are all passing itf around to each other. Marvelous read.
B005544V6A|4.0|I like this show!  Its quirkey, The characters are great and each one adds just enough to the show without being borining
B008J34466|5.0|She is an amazing talent, and a gifted vocalist. There are so many hits on this album, but besides the hits, I love every song. I LOVE THIS ALBUM
B00014K5TQ|3.0|I ordered this movie and got a Screening copy, which means every once in awhile &#34;For screening purposes only&#34; pops up on the screen. Not super anoying but also not what I thought I was going to get. The movie itself is good, but the copy they sent me was not what I expected
B00BJW6YW6|4.0|This album captures the best sounds and moods of Sade without the middle-age smooth jazz veneer. Good addition to the new R&B resurgence with the likes of the-Dream, Twin Shadows, and the Weeknd.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book keep me interested but the twist at the end was certainly not expected.  It was truly gut wrenching!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I saw the first portion of this movie--during the early prison portion--and decided I wouldn't ever like this. However, my wife--Bonnie--convinced me to watch the whole movie. I danced at the end!!!!  Great Movie!!
B009X011UQ|5.0|works just like I want it to!! Is a little odd that it opens opposite to a regular book but you get use to it.
1416905014|5.0|Who doesn't love Cinderella. A Great gift for a little girl, brings the story to life. Wonderful illustrations, lovely fairytale.
B005HI4LLY|4.0|For plot synopsis, see the product description...<br /><br />Tucker and Dalve vs. Evil is a fun little horror movie that pokes fun at and pays homage to the gernre at the same time similar to Behind The Mask, and Cabin In The Woods. (These 3 films would make for a great triple feature.). The film zips along at a good pace, and the laughs are constant, and when the pretty girl falls in love with the loveable Dale it feels genuine.<br /><br />The kills in this movie are played mostly for laughs, often relying too much on CG for the execution. This is my only gripe with the film, the cartoony looking kills sometimes take you out of the experience, becaue they look so fake (Especially the weed-whacker one.), but it doesn't bother me too much, because of the comedic tone set up by the film makers. But it does keep this movie from getting 5 stars from me.<br /><br />There is also a surprisingly good message in the film about not judging people based on there looks, perhaps I've looked too deeply into the film, but the idea of not communicating and misunderstandings is front and center.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is great, the main characters are believable, some of the college kids are hit or miss, but luckily the less talented actors get killed off.<br /><br />If you're looking for a really fun modern horror movie give this one a go.
1402217722|5.0|I just love Georgette Heyer and have read all of her historical fiction novels. Her characters are well developed and interesting. I love the imagery. Well used plot with a twist.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. definitely makes you think. wish there were more levels this was just enough to get me addicted.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is a Die Hard movie only in name. John McClane is now a super hero impervious to bullets, pistol whipping, and yes, even glass (which cut his feet real good in the first movie). There's a plot that makes zero sense, unless the CIA is as effective as kids on a playground playing cops, and a contrived bit we've seen before about a bad father/son relationship that feels more parody than actual drama. This doesn't pass for Die Hard, nor does it really even pass for entertaining, mindless action. Things just....happen....people say stuff...and you find yourself really missing Hans reading \\"ho ho ho.\\" If the first three films were a shiny new bike on Xmas morning, this is a lump of coal. No, worse.... It's a blurry photograph of a lump of coal and a third graders bad poetry written on the back.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|Terrific listening with lots of old favorites!  A must for  Rolling Stones fans, as well as new converts to their music.
0470876417|5.0|This book is phenomenal.  Provides a complete set of things one has to consider when building a business.  What is your product, who are you customers, what is the value proposition that will make them want your product, what will it take you to do it, how much will it cost you, how much revenue might you generate.  Hard work to get through all this - I'm no where near done.  But I know what I need to do and Alex has given me the tool to do it.<br /><br />I have also downloaded his Strategzer online tool.  Again, very nominally priced and extremely useful, especially permitting me to print out the my initial business model canvas to share with others.
B008Q0D32S|2.0|Cannot judge right now, considering I was not able to finish the movie.  I will find time to view it once more.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The bar was set pretty high with the original LOTR trilogy, and I'll admit I didn't think this film was going to reach those previous levels, but I have to say I was completely blown away within the first couple of minutes of watching this.  Now some people will complain this film is too long, some will say there is no reason for this one book to be split up into an entire trilogy of films, but I'll just say that I appreciate everything Peter Jackson is doing.  When you have 13 dwarves, and countless other characters and enemies to introduce and explore, and multiple plot points and stories to tell, it's pretty difficult to cover it all in one 3 hour film, which is why I think Jackson decided to expand it into three films (well that and I'm sure money had something to do with it too).  I enjoyed how the movie took its time in the beginning and didn't rush right into any battles or chase sequences...there's nothing wrong with making the audience wait a little bit before all the action starts and instead introducing them to some characters and back story, which I think Jackson did a pretty good job at here.<br /><br />While I do recommend to most people that waiting for the Extended Edition of this film to hit Blu-Ray in November (or sometime in the Fall) is the smart thing to do, I just loved this film so much that I couldn't wait that long to watch this again in hi-def, so I figured why not just buy this version (the 5-disc 3D version that is) now, and then later on in the year when the EE comes out, buy that and give this one away to my sister or a friend or someone.  Spending $25 for a \\"stop gap\\" version of this film isn't that a big of a deal to me, especially since I find this adaption so great and wonderful that I plan on watching it again and again until the EE comes out, which then I'll just rinse and repeat all over again, but with that version instead.
B008Y78M60|2.0|I was unable to finish viewing the move therefore cannot judge the same.  I will find time to view it once more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun.  I hope they add more levels soon! I can't wait to keep playing.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|Not for the faint hearted, it can be quite graphic in parts.  Very cleverly done.  Story line, acting, casting, etc.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Epic. Couldn't put it down. Definitely a must read series. Characters, plots and storyline just keep you going. Fantastic end to a great series, I will surely miss these characters!
B000H6FE1M|5.0|Schleich toy animals are hand painted and are so life-like looking.  They also have a nice weight to them.  My granddaughter loves these toys - we've been collecting many.  The shipping company &#34;Really Great Toys&#34; had a delivery date of July 10 - 15 (something like that) but the hedgehog showed up before July 4th holidays.  Great service!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, the drama was matched with the savvy story line of the defense lawyer. This a movie that you love to watch more than once and twice is still not enough!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Fun game that you can play for several hours on end without getting too bored. I only gave 4 stars because it does take a lot to get to t he next shark and you need to nearly fully upgrade your current shark<br />.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The best game ever invented..I highly recommend this app<br />I recommend this app to anybody who is looking for a challenge
B0071XO8RA|5.0|writer kept the suspense of who was doing what and what was going to happen next to whom.  I would definitely read a sequel.
B000003TAR|5.0|I had only heard a couple songs off this album before purchasing it and listening to it all. You know, &#34;Heart-Shaped Box&#34;, &#34;Rape Me&#34; and &#34;All Apologies&#34;, but I hadn't heard the rest before. So when I purchased the album and listened to it all for the first time, I was a bit appauled at it. I thought it sounded atrocious. Nothing like Nevermind, and more eery and screechy than Bleach could've ever been. I decided to give it a few more chances, for the sake of my love for Nirvana.<br />With more and more listens to the songs on this album, I noticed the screechy sounds had gone away and were replaced with Kurt Cobain's true, raw soul. The lyrics went from disturbing and uncomfortable screams became beautiful, yet depressing pieces of art.<br />All in all, this album is a true masterpiece that Cobain had wanted out of his band (Though it did lead him to suicide, he still wasn't afraid to express what he thought about things).<br />True, it is a hard listen. A very hard album to listen to, but the more times you listen to it, the more you realise how well put together it was.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first or second book, but I guess you can't win them all. Katnis lost some of her edge.
B006ZMMBU4|5.0|Love this had to buy it for my great grandson his first movie he sat down long enough to watch an has not stopped!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was so much better than the movie. The characters are so much more interesting than the movie was able to capture.

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Gives you a great insider's look at how American rock music was made in the studio , back in the day.<br />Never realized the infamy of Sound City to many of music's creators.<br />Lots of familiar rock legends and some background from the producers that brings a<br />shine to this documentary. Some great tracks that were somewhat improvised on the spot , it seemed.<br />Included the musical talent and insight from the likes of Grohl, Young, Petty, Springfield, Reznor, Novoselic, McCartney, Hawkins , many , many more.<br />Some good historical footage spliced in ( Nirvana )  and showcases the men who actually founded and ran Sound City, from the business perspective.<br />Super enjoyed it all.

B009YN2M7S|3.0|This is a very touching story. I enjoyed the book. I made the mistake of reading this after I watched the movie because the movie left so many questions. In doing so, I found some of the book a little less enjoyable. But, all in all, it was very good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fast and Easy to use. Maps are simple to navigate and information comes up quickly. Lots of options to get the weather info I need.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My 4 year old and almost 2 year old love this movie, and I do too.  It is not scary although the first couple minutes seem like it, it quickly becomes funny.
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|Yes! Get it!
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Its a cool story, dude!  A feel good story about surfing and larger things in life. Gets a little Disney-ish in places, however.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|You know... it's GREAT!
B003UAMWWQ|3.0|The movie is funny at times, but really stupid at times. Overall we found the movie to be not worth the time.

I was pleasantly surprised at the story and all that went into this movie. The production, casting, directing, acting, sets, locations, camera work, wardrobe, F/X, stunts, music and everything else are all great.  Zombie eats brain, Zombie gets girl, Zombie loses girl, Zombie rescues girl.  I am not going to tell you more about the movie because that will spoil the surprise if you haven't heard what it is already.  If you like Zombie movies you may be disappointed if all you're looking for is lots of shocking turn your stomach Zombie gore.  Not that there isn't some realistic gore and excellent scares as well.  If's just this movie is a notch above standard Zombie movies with some romance and a better ending for most the humans.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to buy it.<br /><br />Recommendations:  [[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B004ZJZQA6 Dawn of the Dead Unrated (Blu ray + DVD + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]], and [[ASIN:B0037Q9L72 In Search of Zombieland]]<br />CA Luster
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are many many plans you can use ranging from just a few days to a whole year.  There are normal reading plans like reading through the New Testament, Psalms & Proverbs, the whole Bible, and the Bible chronologically, but there are also topical readings on specific subjects or devotional readings that include devotions made by Christian artists.<br /><br />There is also every translation available as well as different languages.  You even have the option to download some versions for free so you can read offline.<br /><br />You also have the option to highlight, bookmark, and write notes.  There is also a public area that you can read other people's notes or write your own.  You also have the option of keeping your notes private if you choose to do so.<br /><br />This app (and website) has helped me so much in exploring the Bible and I'm grateful I found it.

It was well into the movie before I understood the plot, and it was hard to keep my interest up to that point.  If I hadn't read good reviews I might have bailed on it.  That said, when I realized what was truly going on I was very interested and glued to my seat. A young wife is depressed over her husband being in prison for years and even on his return home she must see a doctor for her condition.  The doctor has her try a new medication on the market but she doesn't respond well at and becomes despondent.  What follows takes several twists and turns of what is reality.  Well worth seeing, but you will need to be patient until about halfway into the movie.  Glad I saw it, but I don't think I will buy it.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B001F62C90 Don't Say A Word]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game! I'm always up for a challenge and this bane definitely offered a good challenge! Some of the levels are frustrating but you'll figure it out soon or later!
B007MDB71O|5.0|If you like SciFi you will like this movie... I loved the books by Edgar Rice Burroughs and this was a pretty decent rendition into a movie. My Family and I enjoyed the movie so much we bought the Blue Ray in 3D... The 3D was good quality on our 70\\" Sony TV. I don't know why people didn't go to the movies to see this... maybe because it wasn't advertised well and no one knew the background to this movie. It has good special effects and a good story and the 3D was well done(they had to put a couple of books worth into it so that it would make sense if you didn't read the books). Add it to your movie collection you will be glad you did.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I ave had this game on my mom and my  dads phone know that it's on my kindle it's great!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game  it is easy at first but then it gets challenging but not hard get this game if u don't like it just delete it but I don't think that will happen
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great movie a must see film!! Every one should go see this movie or rent it now!! Get it now!!
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|needed an ap to take quick notes and this fills the bill nicely....no hoops to jump through just download it and you are good to go!<br />works with the keyboard function or with the touch of a finger or stylus.....fast, easy, great stuff!!!
1616960922|5.0|I'm a Brandon fan, admittedly. I don't know why I waited almost a year to read this book. It's because I really like Brandon's longer works. He is obviously most comfortable in a larger setting, but this one just feels right. Although I'll admit I am left wanting more.<br /><br />This book was fantastic, it was filled with tension and details and interesting characters. I can't say enough good things about it, well worth a read if you're a Brandon fan, and even if you're not.
B004SDEP38|3.0|great if I am only carrying complete documents but useless for creating new ones or taking notes, without adding other apps.....too much fuss and bother  not what I was looking for....I can see that would be useful for certain business functions but not what I was looking for for my kindle....I use my laptop for those.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am a fan of the find your way out games.  And this is a great one, very well put together.
B00B5P37IG|2.0|I wanted a way to watch current BBC etc programing on my tablet....this does not appear to be it.  What I wanted was a low fee or no fee access to specific programs available on free and cable tv at times other than their normal broadcast times.....<br />like when I'm stuck in an airport or in a motel with limited cable and want to watch a show I have missed due to scheduling....
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|The trailer originally attracted us to Upside Down and after watching it we believe it is an odd movie without execution on all the high notes.  On the surface, the concept of two worlds, sharing an atmosphere but separated by a distinct gravity is exciting.  The two worlds are a new concept.  A science fiction lover would appreciate the subtle anarchistic slum of below as a sharp contrast to the perfect distopia of the above world.  The graphics are stunning, and always poetic.  Sharp, mountain vistas give way to an inverted gleaming skyline.  Pay attention to the breathtaking paraselene effect on the summit of the two worlds.<br /><br />Character development on the other hand is not this movie's strong point.  At first my wife and I thought Kristen Dunst was cast too old for this movie.  My wife suggested Jennifer Lawrence!  After conclusion Kristen Dunst was appropriate for the movie, and that's not a good thing.  Her role as *spoiler* an amnesiac, starry-eyed ex-teenage lover didn't leave anything to act.  We've seen this play before, but never on an inverted stage.  Kristen Dunst used all of her talents, the girl next door gaze, and the adoring smile.  Alas, Eden as a character is one dimensional and a shameful romance novel trope of lover/amnesiac.  She even manages to sneak in the disgusting and derivative \\"Spiderman kiss\\" except she is the one who is upside down!  The actor was very good, and played his role as the nerdy, obsessive scientist to the T.<br /><br />If you're still reading, you must wonder why I am writing this review.  This movie is a warning.  It is a warning to those in Hollywood who would release a genre bending Sci-fi/Romance movie and fail to execute either the romance plotline, or the sci-fi plot to any acceptable resolution.  Give us two, deliver one plot line to a climax, but don't drop both balls!<br /><br />We have the romance plot starting with 3 strikes against it: Its a flashback driven teenage lusty relationship, amnesia has beendone to hell in other movies, and the actress is neither sufficiently beautiful to desire or complicated enough to be interesting.  The entire romance part of this movie was the first 10 minutes in the beginning of the movie, 5 minutes of flashback, and the \\"kiss in the sunset moment\\" of the finale. What was the rest of the movie about?<br /><br />Now as a male, sci-fi lover I am very sad to say the rest of the movie was setting up the glorious inverse worlds.  I love the interesting class warfare undertone, with the oppressed begging to have some justice.  Unfortunately there exists no justice, and as one character puts it \\"the top side always wins\\" which was a overt scolding of the audience who expects a glorious revolutionary climax.  Critical plot technology is revealed in the first 10 minutes.  I had expectation of a Deus Ex Machina moment, like Star Trek where Wesley Crusher puts two screws and a tricorder together to save the Enterprise!  Unfortunately while those of us in the audience are expecting the protagonists to use this technology to emancipate the underclass, or at least, give a finger to the man, the protagonists use this technology... to make babies.<br /><br />To my relief, even the said making of the babies was an off screen conception.  In conclusion, we have an A+ film school class project movie with AAA visuals tied to a boring, been there romance plot and an interesting sci-fi stage.  There are some glimmers of brilliance in the office scenes, especially the subtle references to managerial desk being high above on the ceiling!  The end of the movie leaves so much to be desired, it screams that the producers were banking on a sequel.<br /><br />Unfortunately their target market of sci-fi lover and and romance lover were highly teased but never satisfied.  For a movie featuring two opposite worlds, it never succeeds in uniting sci-fi lovers with romance junkies.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse continues to deliver great music here. No disappointments here at all. I can't wait for more of their albums to come out.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini is an excellent writer.  I enjoy the way he weaves the characters together and they are so well drawn.You really sense the struggles they are going through.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|There are few albums that have so many good songs. I love almost every single song on this album. I've already got good mileage out their music.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game.  It is a perfect replica of the original game on Facebook, with the added benefit of not having to be online to play it.  I would rrcommend this to everyone.
B008469DGY|5.0|i  am addicted to this game!  it is one of my new favorite games, i  cant get enough of it!
B006N0YWGY|2.0|Wasn't sure what the game actually was when I downloaded.  In playing it I found it is not the type of game that I like. Nothing wrong with the game...just not my preferred type of game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this os a very challenging and fun game. i think its great. PLZ HELP. im stuck on level 8. there nothing else to do. what is the combination for the gears under yhe desk and how do i get them?
B000VSAEYI|1.0|My 2 year old daughter was so excited to receive her new pool.  She really enjoyed herself but unfortunately, the slide popped and the pool tore is two different places.  It tore right along the seam where the slide was sealed to the bottom.<br /><br />I was unable to patch it and it was too large to return, so I just dumped it.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|My daughter-in-law put it in for me and it was ok I would recommend it. I like love stories and mysteries.
B0083B3KOQ|2.0|The product works but one must be connected first to the internet to convert files. The file gets uploaded first to the app company server and gets converted and automatically gets downloaded back to your folder. Do you really want some unknown stranger having your files sent to their server?? I don't know the app developers. Would you want a complete<br />stranger to have a copy of your files?? I don't.<br /><br />Secondly if you want to convert an entire dozen songs in an album you can't convert multiple files at a time. It takes forever one by one.<br /><br />I am using it with my kindle. If there was no uploading my files to a stranger (this developer is not a cloud I trust) and if I could convert a full album at once I would give it 5 stars.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have a lot of trouble using facebook. I have read and reread the directions but still don't understand them or it. All I ever do is play solitaire because I can't get any of the other games to come up.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Just as thrilling and exciting as the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings....thoroughly enjoyable.  Can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My two younger grandchildren and their cousins loved this game and play it all the time. I would recommend it .
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I am a devoted Castle fan and enjoyed associating the characters with their tv actors.  I know I will read the rest of the series and am sure I will love them too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game  because it is easy to play. If you let the letter jump where they want to go. My little Granddaughter likes to play it also.
B0034G4OWW|5.0|If you want to laugh i recommend this movie, family adore it, we watch over and over.  Movie arrived excellent, good shipping, 5 stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, very challenging and really makes you think. Please bring more levels I made it through level 10!
0060833459|5.0|This book is fantastic! Definitely a \\"must read\\" for every professional. The book discusses prescriptive steps for getting the right things done.
B00288KNJU|5.0|My granddaughter's favorite movie ever! Very, very good! 3D version was cool to watch. My grandkids were trying to catch things in the air. Loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was one of the first apps I got for my Kindle Fire. A year later it is still one of my favorites! It is simple and easy to use.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I wish there was a simple way to highlight interesting sentences & move forward & backward easier. I like it on every device I have.
B005LAJ212|5.0|LOVE THIS!!  No commercial interruptions!  It's the best way to keep up with all of the changes in Emily's life.  This show has so many fast moving story line parts, you have to watch an episode more than once to catch everything.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|The CD was really good, my dad loved getting it for fathers day. He listens to every day on his way to work and on the way home.  :-)
0143113100|4.0|LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ME IMPROVE MY MEMORY, AND IT OFFERED ADDITIONAL COMPUTER GAMES FOR THAT PURPOSE.  I'M NOT A GAME PERSON AND SO THIS WAS A STRETCH FOR ME, BUT I CAN SEE IMPROVEMENTS.
B00114RKT8|5.0|This moving rendition of the life of William Wilberforce is a must-have in any DVD library.  Most Americans, including myself, are fairly ignorant about the fight to abolish slavery in Great Britain.  If not for the determination of one man, it may never have happened.  Had there been such a person in the United States, we may well have avoided the Civil War.  Ioan Gruffudd shines as Wilberforce, and Albert Finney is remarkable as John Newton, the author of the lyrics of the hymn Amazing Grace.  Once you see this movie, you will never hear that hymn again without thinking about the history behind it.  I highly recommend this DVD.
159463176X|4.0|like the author, not a page turner, however I fine few that are. mind is on surviving the obamanation of our once great country. a crying shame that a gagle of racist, entitlement addicts, homosexuals and other asst. morons can place a good teleprompter reader a the head of the nation.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Good writing and some funny dialogue. Reminded me of the movie JUNO. I pictured the two kids from that movie in these two roles in the book. I wouldn't recommend this for any adult but rather the teen / young adult genre. Sorry.
B003U69IX6|5.0|Used the rental option through Amazon streaming and it works like a charm.  Much easier then going to the store.<br /><br />This movie is a bit cheesy and off the books, but my kids love it and can't wait for the next one.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|What a great album by George.  I've listened to him since Breezin came out in the 70's and he hasn't lost anything with age the opposite he has matured and has put out a great record of great music once again.  Perfect for sitting by the pool or driving to the beach.
B00881VLCE|1.0|not smooth, slow, difficult to move pieces.  Used to be my favorite game on my Kindle.  take it back to the previous version.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an unexpectedly fun game. I've really enjoyed playing it! I would recommend this game to everyone, even if you are not experienced in playing games you will have  fun with HCR!
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|Got this for my birthday it's awesome and amazing and super man is the best more that he's a hit
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It is a fun app. I enjoy playing this game, just wish there was a way to earn more lives. I really wanted candy crush.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Wish it had real multiplayer, but it's a great app to scratch the Mtg itch while out and about. Love the sealed mode
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not stop reading until I was done and I don't have time to read.  I would recommend it and may read it again .
B009XIXVU6|2.0|great narrative bi hard to follow and disjointed at times. lots of new characterers bein introduced righ u to the end of the book. perspective of book changes repeatedly woth storu beon told by manu sifferent people at different times. hard to follow jumping nack and forth in time and with different characters.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love this show!  It is well conceived, well written, well directed, and well acted.  I love the version of two realities in the show, past and present/future.  The struggle between good and evil is complex --- not too simple minded.  I hope the show continues past the current season.
B000G75994|5.0|The sound is crystal clear and the playing is wonderful.  I waffled between getting Pires' or Uchida's collection.  I got both and prefer Pires' playing over Uchida's.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot wait to watch the next episode everytime.  I love the time period and the characters are well rounded.  This season leaves you wanting more.  Cannot wait for Season 4.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|The Good.<br /><br />It has many buttons to set up an optimal layout. The software is very easy to use. Over all it reacts and plays well.<br /><br />The Bad.<br /><br />The 3 bottom buttons on the keypad area are a bit awkward to hit. The back side had no rubber grip on it to keep it from sliding off my recliners armrest, very annoying. The only rubber backing on it is if you place it on a table the odd spots that have some grip on them will make contact with the surface. I highly doubt most of the intended users of this thing use it on a table. So, PUT SOME RUBBER BACKING ON THE FUTURE ONES LOGITECH. I put my own rubber backing on it.<br /><br />The Ugly.<br /><br />The thing is heavy. Probably from the absolutely useless LCD screen on it. It displays information you could easily see on your computer like warcraft stats(pointless and it doesn't even show spell stats or range), Some useless news feed, Time and some stopwatch. I can only assume they want to keep track of you like every software company thinks they have the right to these days. Take the LCD out in the future ones Logitech...
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Its a mind game, makes you think. Wish there were a bit more directions or even a helping button.<br /><br />Revised July 8th 2013... Got to level 10 and done with the game? Other levels are locked and say 'coming soon'<br /><br />Not happy about that.
B00CKWQN9S|5.0|This CD is the best purchase I've made in a long time. the transaction was quick and easy. Thank you very much.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|I didn't even finish watching it. I guess if you are a lawyer or a politician you'll like it. But for the rest of us is a waste of time. There is no need to pay good money to watch a bunch of old men arguing about politics; you can watch it live in TV everyday.
B008A1B5Z0|3.0|Keep in mind that I'm not an &#34;Android Techie&#34; ... and most of us users of Android Devices aren't!<br /><br />It appears to work as advertised ... However, I'm uncertain as to just what it does<br />in terms of actual management of the APPS staying &#34;closed&#34; on my Kindle.<br />Better documentation as to why this APP was created and how to manage space<br />on mu android device would be of great assistance in taking full advantage of this<br />product!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love this game and told me to rate it as excellent! I personally don't play, but it occupies them for hours. My 4 years old is a pro at it. He loves to move the IPAD from side to side as the runner runs.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great challenge. Totally funs grating and addicting. Need more!  I think that some of the challenges can be knowledge base not just s t visual.<br /><br />Quietguy
B008220DIC|5.0|ok, so apparently everyone here is saying its quite a bor and that there's no plot. well if you'd like something more interesting, im sure Transformers will be able to keep you interested. As for this film its masterfully put together in showing, the effects of how one individual has an impact on one another. Also be aware that this is basically an art house film, so if you were expecting a explosive plot, you wont find it.<br /><br />as for the blu ray:<br />Movie: 10/10 (in my opinion, best film of 2012)<br />Video: 10/10 shot using 70mm film, this is one of the best video quality blu's on the market. its perfect.<br />Audio: 8/10 could have been better with the surround sound usage.<br />Bonus Features: 5/10 very decent especially with the interesting deleted scenes/blooper reel as one.<br /><br />overall, this isnt going to please everyone, but it certainly doesnt deserve 1 star.
B004QBWU02|5.0|`American Graffiti' is one of those films I had yet to see it and had very little desire to.  Yes, I understand that it is seen as a cinematic staple by many critics and it spurned the careers of Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfus, but I often look at George Lucas as a hack who got lucky and find him to be the poor man's equivalent to Steven Spielberg, and Steven Spielberg isn't really anything to aspire to if we're going to be completely honest.  Having recently watched and semi-loathed `Dazed and Confused' and then reading that `American Graffiti' was in the same wheelhouse, I was almost hesitant to jump in, but it was sitting there on my DVR just begging for my attention.<br /><br />I just had to watch it.<br /><br />I have to say, maybe it is the nostalgic fact that I grew up on `Happy Days' reruns but the minute I saw Opie I was kind of smitten with this movie.  I know that his Oscar win is despised by so many, but whatever.  The man has honed his craft and perfected his take on schmaltzy drama and so why fault him for it?<br /><br />But this isn't about him, at least not entirely.<br /><br />`American Graffiti' is one of those coming of age films that attempts to do a whole lot more than merely focus on the coming of age of a solitary individual.  It doesn't even focus on the mere `growing up' of a group of people.  `American Graffiti' sets its sights on an era and uses the lens to expose the passions, joys, pains and ultimate maturing of a time and space and all the people caught within it.  I never grew up in the 60's.  I wasn't even a thought in the 60's.  Still, I felt like I was there every moment of this film.  I could feel the heat from the engines and the sticky leather seats and the musk in the air and Cindy Williams breath and tears on my neck as we slow danced in the dark.  This feeling is really aided immensely by the glorious soundtrack that accompanies each frame.<br /><br />I must admit, I was kind of in love with Richard Dreyfuss's face here.  I'll confess that I really haven't seen him in a lot.  I am one of the few who absolutely LOVED him in `Mr. Holland's Opus' and find him to be the clear standout in `Jaws', but I'm more familiar with his work past his prime and so I was taken aback with how young and endearing he was here.  He just dripped charm and charisma all over the place, and his performance really anchors this film.  You can watch him stumble through his own internal conflictions from the very start to the very end, when he finally comes into his own.  This one wonton night of careless wandering gives him the final push, that needed reassurance, that all is going to be ok.  Watching him ponder what he is leaving behind, ponder what he's missing out on and eventually ponder what his future will bring brought endless smiles to my face.<br /><br />The central themes and life lessons contained in the film are beautifully captured by a few moments of subtle obviousness.  Early in the film we see Curt trying to unlock his locker, and the image itself implants the message that one cannot go back, and then as the sun comes up and the film dwindles to a close we see Steve and Laurie walking towards the camera, the sun glaring in the backdrop and we are reminded that we can move forward.<br /><br />With a collective ensemble that is to die for and an intricately woven tapestry of stories that all feel whole and completely fleshed out, `American Graffiti' is one of those gems I never thought would wind up being a gem!'ll confess that I really haven't seen him in a lot.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|LOVE this game!!! Very entertaining! And it's free so it's a must download! You will not be disappointed with this game!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Smile people as the wheel still turns and the pattern still weaves we shall continue to strive for peace and continuance
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's the best keyboard to me, and when they added flow it became even better!  I couldn't see my self using any other kb at this point.  The suggestions for word predictions are context aware..  Good stuff..
B004I1WIWU|5.0|I requested it from Argentina, the disk arrived in very good condition and sooner than expected. It is a great Album with the best songs from Adele. The highly recommend for all lovers of good music, and also recommend to buy it at Amazon, warranty of reliability, quality and respect for the customer around the world.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|this movie was so cute and funny!! I will tell every body I know to watch it if they haven't!!!!
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|I requested it from Argentina, the disk arrived in very good condition and sooner than expected. It is a great Album, one of the best sellers in the history of music and this collector's Edition is a must. The highly recommend for all lovers of good music, and also recommend to buy it at Amazon, warranty of reliability, quality and respect for the customer around the world.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|There are a number of great tunes redone with the influence of the guest artists as well as his sons
B0094OLJD0|5.0|This is an incredible album! What they reflect musically is pure genius and definitely worth listening to repeatedly. Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unfortunately I found out the end to season 3 before I saw the last episode while watching  another television show.  But you will be surprised by the end of this season if it hasn't been divulged elsewhere.
B00C061I3K|3.0|However, this album only had about 3 songs that I liked including &#34;Lose Yourself to Dance&#34; and &#34;Get Lucky.&#34;  While I like this album, I feel that this album doesn't live up to Daft Punk's other albums.  I personally loved virtually all of the soundtrack to the &#34;Tron Legacy&#34; playlist as well as many of Daft Punk's other songs.  My advice is to buy only some songs on this album.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Purchased this lego set for my 8 year old to make and gift to my 45 year old VW enthusiast partner for his birthday. Was a hit for both! The entire VW bus is classic - and whether young or old this product is enjoyed. Also must mention, kudos for Amazon for providing much less expensive and for shipping in one day, even though was to take two!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved this app until this morning when it automatically undated.  It is very not user friendly anymore and it is very hard to use.  Do not waste your time with it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I don't really watch TV but when it comes to Supernatural, I'm there! I just love this show and I was finally happy was able to buy the seventh season. Also, the package came a two days earlier, which I was really, really happy about. Now I just have to wait for the eighth one to come out. Got say, I just love Jared Padalecki &#60;3
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My family and I all loved this game. On the surface it was interesting but not impossible. Our toddler could find enjoyment just moving pieces. Our older daughter delighted in helping out. My husband and I loved working together as the game had elements that catered to both of us: details for me, puzzles for him. To tie it all together was a very immersive environment centering on alchemy. We look forward to expansion from Fireproof Games.
1781162646|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  While a supernatural element plays an important plot point, King has succeeded in writing a good old fashioned whodunit rather than a horror tale.  Recommended!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|very funny and family friendly. entertaining for adults too. loved it would watch again or reccomend to anyone young and old.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved how the author described the different settings. I felt like while I was reading I could see the surrounding arena, the action. It was a great read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book Five leaves a LOT yet to resolve. Very engaging series with lots of twists and unexpected turns. Read ALL five.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hated the book but I figured o would give it a good rating because you people actually like this trash!!!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A friend introduced me to the HBO Series &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; and I was HOOKED! Immediately downloaded these and burned through them. Couldn't put them down. Currently there are five volumes in a projected eight volume series. Read them ALL!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If your ever looking for something to do, I highly suggest this. The time I've spent on the game has always been enjoyable
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|All the movies were very entertaining to watch and it was good to see how all the regulars aged thru the years. Even then the special effects were good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great thrilling book best I have ever read I wish they would come out with a fourth
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Some controls are tiny on phone size screens,  but not totally  unusable, and nice on tablets.  Good play options,  a bit of nickel and diming for dlc/unlock stuff, but again, the food outweighs the bad,  besides,  its magic... You have to expect some $$$ to be attached to playing it.  Try the  free version and pay the 10 bucks if you like it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app to have when traveling. Able to check weather updates and receive weather alerts up to 10 locations. Only con is you need to be connected to Wi-Fi in order for app to work. Freezes every now and again, just close the app reopen it and it works just fine.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|It's been a while since Duffy released this album and I finally decided to purchase it. I don't regret it at all. Every track is worth the money spent.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|So I got the app and I took a while loading but then when I got on the game it wouldn't let me move.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter 7 and I love this game. We had a great time finding all the items and we love that we spend time together doing something that we both enjoyed. We hope they bring more rooms with Clues for us to keep playing together.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Now this is worth. I love to play around making pictures with this one. It get's you away from the every day hassle. Have fun with if you get it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait for the next one! Very good book more than I had expected. Love the author and the work she puts out!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Ach, he's so good at what he does. Recommended - light, a little sad and sweet. A lovely little fairy tale.
B007FROH4G|4.0|A tremulous and thought provoking book. The insight into the reality of Alice's world visited me  with overinding emotions, and anxiety to understand as much as possible within the time frame given, a frame which moves quickly and with remorseless determination to strip away her treasured identity, creating a changed and constantly changing Alice, leaving my brain little time to assimilate the current before moving past it and in so doing, awakening me to a small measure of her isolated terror.  I found it poignant that she found her comforts where she did, and it highlighted for me how much we need and seek to belong and to share experiences, no matter where or when they visit us or for how short a time.  Frightening, sensitive, inquisitive, because something is emotionally difficult to incorporate into the psyche, negates not the need to try.  Thank you for this book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is one of my favorite authors, and he did not disappoint me. He has well thought out plots, and realistic people. I enjoy the detective and his experiences.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry Birds. One of the most popular games there is for mobile devices. Yes I did enjoy it at some point but it got boring FAST. I do however recommend this game to anyone. You can destroy pigs, blocks of wood,glass, and BOMBS. You have different settings and birds and you can master your birds and learn what they do to be unstoppable. It sounds fun and it was at first, but now I've moved on to awesomer games. Go on. PLAY THIS GAME.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I found this film to be done in extremely poor taste. I would not recommend anyone watch it. Hated it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Win I here's of mindcraft on pc I had to get a pc but thanks for mindcraft pocket edition I can play ever ware I go
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|.....just escapist entertainment, then this might be for you.  Frankly, my life is reality and I don't need reality movies for entertainment.  Life is always a heartbeat away...so, when I want to get away from it all and suspend reality for a while, an escapist movie will do it.  It is no wonder why this type of movie is so popular currently.  The World is a complicated place with lots of bad things, bad people, bad news.  So, here we have it, the same sort of escapist entertainment I had as a kid, then is was comic books, now it is movies... it doesn't get more 'escapist' than this... do yourself a favor, escape for a couple of hours and enjoy....
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful games I have played on my Kindle Fire, as well as being the absolute best puzzle game to date. This game reminds me of playing Myst, the puzzles are challenging and each one is different. I can't wait to see more chapters to this awesome game.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Awesome movie. One of my favorites. I love the comedy and characters that are portrayed by the actors voices. Such a great film. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Having to fill in all of the spaces as well as complete the routes, definitely adds difficulty!  Thanks for hours of challenging fun.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Waste of time Save the effort do not DOWNLOAD THIS PIECE OF JUNK does not tell any thing you don't know from playing the game
B005HEFB6M|5.0|When Enterprise debuted in the fall of 2001 we had come off of having Star Trek on TV starting with The Next Generation which begat Deep Space Nine which begat Voyager while also having several Star Trek movies in the theaters. Star Trek had saturated our media culture for over a decade and there was obviously some franchise fatigue that had set in with the tepid reception for Enterprise. Enterprise survived four seasons rather than the expected seven enjoyed by the previous three series. It is typically the most critically dissed of the Star Trek series and dismissed by many fans as being a misstep for the franchise. I enjoyed the series when it first ran but didn't have the same regard for it that I did TNG and DS9. So it was good to be able to revisit this series via Amazon. Watching Enterprise again has given me a greater appreciation for just how good the characters and stories were once separated from the other series. Season 1 of Enterprise has surprisingly few poor episodes and the overall quality is high. Broken Bow starts the series off with a bang with the best premiere for the franchise. We then get to see how Earth finally moved out of the shadow of Vulcan supervision to become a leader in the politics of the quadrant and in exploring &#34;strange new worlds.&#34; I really enjoyed exploring how our relationship with the Vulcans evolved with the complication of dealing with the Andorians and being a buffer between these species. Then you had the introduction of the Suliban and the Temporal Cold War. In watching this series again (all four seasons back to back) this story arc worked for me. It was an interesting way to bring in the future of the Federation hinging on the actions of Captain Archer and the crew of the Enterprise. A great stand alone episode was Shuttlepod One which helped bond the characters of Trip and Malcolm for the duration of the series. Season 1 set a solid foundation for the success of this series. It is just a shame that Enterprise didn't get the full seven-year run that it deserved.didn't get the full seven-year run that it deserved.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is .y favorite horse game I have on my kindle and of you are a ln animal freak like me you will like it too trust me hope you enjoy ot as much as I do
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Excellent Series - Can't wait to order Season 2 - Convenience & Quality of Product is 100% and definitely worth the price to Purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this app. It has improved rapidly since the first version getting better everytime. This is the best you can get with mobile minecraft. You should really consider getting this app over all the other non-official clones. Totally worth the $7 dollars.
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Love the 1st movie with Stalone, this one is just ok... some cool fights but nothing new...<br />Its just ok
B00DD49R0E|5.0|This was a hilarious movie for both kids and adults. The animation was cleaner crisper compared to the first despicable me. The love for the minons by many is seen through this sequel as there are scenes that focus on the minions. There are a few spots in the movie were it may seem a little dragged out, but those are minimal. The ending will have you laughing constantly. This is a film that parents can enjoy during a family movie night.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So different to read a book from a guy's point of view so this made this book so enjoyable to read.  I had laugh out loud moments!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book! So happy it made it out! Ready for more to come! I love this series! The best one out!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I've been reading this book since 6th grade, and it never gets old. The book is just wonderful, and I always recommend this book
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Laughed so very much, great entertainment. Both actors complemented each other. Can't imagine anybody else playing these parts. Kudos to the casting team.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow! I'm speechless as I ugly cry! Such an emotional read. I didn't expect that ending! Gotta figure out how to write a review for this damn book!<br /><br />Here goes nothing! I had no idea this book was going to be about this!! Wow! I knew New Adult and YA books were deep...but damn if I'm not ugly crying at the end of this one! From the beginning, I knew I was going to love Will, but wow...I didn't realize how much until the end of this book! He had to grow up fast after a tragic accident. He wanted guardianship of his 7 year old brother so much that he gave up his college life, girlfriend, and life in general to be his brothers world. He realized how much his brother meant to him. Now...that is commendable! Two years later, Lake also had a rough sequence of event happen to where she had to move to Michigan and leave her senior year of high school. She was so bitter about leaving, but never let it bother her relationship with her brother. She doted on him throughout the whole book. I loved it. Most 9 year olds get on your nerves, but she never acted as though he was a burden.<br />I don't want to give the story away, because it was too good not to read, but a lot of stuff goes down that is totally unexpected and I just love Will even more...didn't think it was possible but...wow!!! Her mom gave some sound advice: &#34;find a balance between head and heart.&#34; Don't always follow your heart..listen to your head too! But don't just listen to your head...listen to your heart as well. Love it!<br />Check out more reviews at sultrybookreviews.blogspot.com
B000W91RUG|5.0|The first time my husband and I actually watched this, we had no idea that we would get addicited to it. Gave it a second try and that's all it took, couldn't wait for the next episode.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game was very addictive. I was very addicted to getting all three stars. The game is great for all ages. This is exactly what I expected from the creators of Cut the rope (which was also amazing).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing. I would definitely read it again. It was a bit inappropriate so don't let your children read it! It was a great book all in all.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|The game starts off very simple, but almost immediately different components are added to make the game more challenging and entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is a fun game and very challenging. need to give hints to help with some clues. very intereating game
B007SGM084|4.0|The book is good but I have read better books and it could have been better written. It is goid
B00122RFOO|5.0|The whole album is flawless and brilliant. Shows the kind of amazing songwriter Van Morrison is. One of the rare times where the album is great from start to finish
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Like Gone Girl, every chapter reveals another facet that is not anticipated.  It  opens up like layers of an onion. Good holiday read!
B004TI5N38|5.0|John is given an order to go to Drake, West Virginia where a general and his family have been murdered. They also have neighbors that have been murdered. John and Samantha Cole, the local police chief work together to solve the case. A real page turner.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|the story took so long I havent done it - might be good for anyone with kids but not for adults
1433535726|5.0|Great bible with very explanatory notes on the bottom.  This was for my husband and he loves it.  Very nicely bound and hansom Bible.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|same as other games like this but too slow when building and if you hit the same village twice in error, it takes your points and rebuilds the same house then it only goes to a certain point and then will not go further or back unless you buy more points - waste of time - am trying to remove from my ipad
B00631VJIC|5.0|Great mix of songs from the show. Each song takes you back to a specific scene from the show. Excellent!
B0063M22QO|4.0|am trying to beat my own scores in the challenges - but wonder what is the perfect score - would be better if it gave you that
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app combined with the right printer gives you the freedom to print from anywhere,documents, photo, spreadsheets, etc.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great challenging game to keep your brain busy! The levels are not over complicated but do require some thinking. Looking forward to more levels!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Despite all the negative reviews I initially read....I still loved it!! I am actuallu happy to hear that there are two more books coming out!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|best book i have ever read. was very good and always had something to make me want to keep reading!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was so emotional for me. I felt like I was on an emotional rollercoaster as I read this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the way its a puzzle with no real clues.  you have to find the clues put them together to get out.  keep these coming.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2! Playing is a great way to kill time in s fun way. I have told almost every person I know about Temple Run series. I will be looking towards other temple run games and apps.
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|As usual Joe's smooth voice is comfort to one's soul. It id refreshing to see real singers still doing and making real music still.
0345347951|5.0|This book gave me that eerie feeling I got when I first saw or read some of my first scifi classics. It's riveting, and a joy to read. It's a meditation on so many philosophical topics, and the end was just amazing. Great plot. I found myself relating the story to so many events of modern life, especially surveillance. What happens when you know you are always being watched by something unfathomably more advanced than you can imagine? How do you change? How does society change? I kept coming back to Snowden and Prism in my mind. Anyway, if you like plot-driven scifi, you can't do much better than this one.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love the Game of Throne series.  Too bad it takes so long to come out on video.  Can't wait to see season 3.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|build up your coins so you don't have to buy gems. Otherwise this is a cool game to play everyday.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderful storytelling, beautifully written.  In my opinion, this is Hosseini's best book so far. It is both heart-wrenching and uplifting at the same time, but also manages to illuminate the mundane failings of man in such a way that it inspires.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Love the show! Love the DVD! I WOULD recommend this to anyone who likes NCIS or action shows. Worth the money spent.....:)
B004YRWA62|1.0|The lead character has a memory problem, so you see a scene and then it goes back to show you what lead to the scene you saw 5 minutes ago.  This goes on for the entire movie and it gets tiring.  I watch movies to be entertained, not to work.<br /><br />I did see the movie through hoping for some big &#34;twist&#34; and then it will all come together for me and I'd be somewhat entertained by the &#34;finale&#34; of it.  I wasn't, there was a twist, but, it just left you feeling bad all around.  Awful movie.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Having played this version for a few minutes and I am hooked.  Didn't think you could improve on perfection. Anything Fallen Trees creates I will have on my Kindle. Keep creating, Trees!
038572179X|5.0|'How guilt refined the methods of self-torture, threading the beads of detail into an eternal loop, a rosary to be fingered for a lifetime.'<br /><br />I very rarely pick up a book if I've already seen the movie. Sure, there are likely to be differences but the experience is still spoiled for me. I had to make an exception with Atonement because I adored the movie but I could see how much more the story would shine and benefit from text. And shine did it ever.<br /><br />Usually I complain about over-descriptiveness in stories, and this was definitely descriptive, yet the author possesses a skill in writing that is completely captivating. He sets the scene with ease and transports you into the very midst of it. His words envelop you and leave you mesmerized. I could go on and on regarding the beauty of this story and the multitude of emotions it managed to evoke in me but put simply, this book was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />I've been told this is the best to expect from Ian McEwan but I will still eagerly dive into more of his works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!! It is so indicating! I have played many other horse games and this on is my favorite.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is soooooooooooooooo FUNNY and fun it's so fun I love it so much I recommended you get this awesome app
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Would like to see more. Enjoyed the game. More levels would be great. Hoping to see many more levels in the future.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|I watched this on a friend's recommendation and loved it from day 1!  I have seen it several times since then because I love the humor.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|ihave this game on my I pad and I loved it so I had to get this on my kindle fire
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I am a huge Breaking Bad Fan and love each season.  The characters and plot are well written and each scene carefully illustrated.  A lot of talented people worked on this series and it's obvious.
1906438463|3.0|This book offers a good end-to-end simulation of the IELTS test. Considering the number of resources available on internet either for free or payed, I consider this book not that essencial to take the exam.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a big Walking Dead Fan and love each season.  The characters and plot are well written and each scene carefully illustrated.  A lot of talented people worked on this series and it's obvious..
B008ALA6DW|3.0|Nothing fantastic on this device. It worked as expected and delivery a normal wired network connection.<br />Since apple is manufacturing computers like macbook-pro retina display, without default market connectors, we consumers end up needing to purchase devices like this one. In my opinion apple should provide default adaptors like this for free for those who purchased macbook-pro retina.
B005LJJ3IU|4.0|This movie is pretty funny as I liked the plot and story building effort that went into it.  The actors and actresses were very good too.  I also watched the extra deleted scenes and understand why they were not included.  Good editing.  Not a lot of depth to this movie.  This movie is for adults only due to language, sexual innuendos and nudity.
