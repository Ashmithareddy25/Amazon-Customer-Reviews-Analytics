0345803507|5.0|These books were definitely not what I was expecting.  I was totally floored.  I loved them!  The characters were so easy to get to know.  I couldn't put these books down.  I wish there were more to read.  I can't wait until the movies come out!
0345803485|5.0|This trilogy has to be the best out there. If you have an imagination you would like to put to good use this is the book for you. Keep an open mind and you will fall in love with these characters
0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman describes exactly what the United states Government (President, Senate, and House of Representatives) must do to bring us out of this depression.  When citizens are NOT spending money, then the Government must spend money.  Anyone who has studied Economics and is familiar with the writing of John Maynard Keynes knows what works.  The Republican members of Congress appear to want this country to suffer a severe Depression.

0345529057|5.0|Item came in impeccable condition.  There was a crease in one of the corners of the box, but that was due to shipping.  Thanks for the great books!  Hard to put them down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  The characters were well developed and I enjoyed the way the book was written.  Once I started reading I finished all 3 books in about a week.  The story is captivating.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I love this book!!  Colleen Hoover really knows how to tap into your emotions with her words!  The characters are so intense and the poetry is amazing.  I read this book on the recommendation of a friend and I am so glad I did!  My heart went out to the characters and their stories and I admit I did cry at least twice.  I cannot wait to read the next book!
0061969656|5.0|I found Death of Kings a natural progression of Uhtred's personal journey and hope the next novel gets him to his triumphant reclamation of his family home and lands. But there was nothing \\"tired\\" in this novel; the pace, the historical detail, the twists and turns, all stayed true to the style that Cornwell has perfected in this Saxon series. Each book in the series has taken me deeper into the history of early Britain; this is historical fiction at its finest. The reader can feel the taste of copper on the lips of the dying in battle scenes that reflect both a bravery and violence that is unimaginable today. The landscape comes alive with the turns of the tides and the burnt-out villages. This book elevated the series and as an author of historical fiction I appreciate the accomplishment of creating a saga infused with the detail as provided in this Saxon series.  Kathryn Callahan, author of [[ASIN:1457502380 Gilded Greed: A Story of Corruption, Revenge and Desire In Old New Orleans]]
B005LAIGPA|4.0|This review is both from me (mom) and from my 14 year old son. We both enjoyed the movie and thought it was intense but with an interesting message.<br /><br />My 12-yr old daughter didn't make it past the first 7 minutes so any preteens who feel the emotions very deeply may not be able to handle what happens in the movie or the relationship between Andrew and his father, mother, or some of the school bullies later on.<br /><br />The movie goes into some deep emotions and you ride the roller-coaster with the main character Andrew: you feel sorry for him, hate the mean people surrounding hime, rejoice when he has friends, laugh at the 'learn the powers' antics, and are bewildered and upset when he abuses his new-found powers.<br /><br />My son wanted any other teens (and parents) to know that this is a good movie with a good message but it is sad.  As a parent, I'd say this is one to watch together and be wary of any teens/kids who (like my daughter) couldn't handle the difficult emotional elements.  I'd also recommend that this is one to watch together -- some interesting talking points for parents and kids.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|When the hoopla for the Beach Boys 50th anniversary started with a promotional video of them re-recording \\"Do It Again\\" (a medium-sized 1968 hit), I was expecting this album to be a warmed over collection of remakes and stuff found from digging in the vaults.  Not so!  Not only did \\"Do It Again\\" not make the final cut for the album, but every track on there is new, or at least never heard before.<br /><br />While not every track is a classic, every track *is* taken seriously like a band doing more than just going through the motions.<br /><br />To my mind, the surprise standout is the bouncy \\"Isn't It Time\\" which I would seriously like to hear on the radio.  The same goes for \\"The Private Life of Bill & Sue\\" -- the lyrics are some sort of commentary on reality TV and as cultural comment, well, so what?, but as music it is incredibly catchy and appealing.  Also good are \\"Spring Vacation\\", the title track, and the stunningly melancholy \\"pure Brian\\" closer \\"Summer's Gone\\" which sounds as though it should have trains and barking dogs at the end.. (I assume most people reading a review for a Beach Boys album at this late date will know what I mean).<br /><br />It's interesting how much they lyrics on this album, while ostensibly often about boy/girl relationships can be read more as metaphors for the inter-personal relationships in the band..<br /><br />Minor nits: Neither Al nor Bruce gets a song of their own (though Mike does) and David Marks apparently does not get to sing at all, though his guitar is heard throughout.  But those are only *minor* nits.  When the last \\"new\\" Beach Boy record was 1992's weak and Brian-less \\"Summer In Paradise\\" and then next occasion all the band was united for was a limp album of country remakes with the Beach Boys actualy *backing* the Country singers and completely wasting Carl's last sessions, then \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is an incredible coda to a spectacular American story (and if they want to make another one, that's fine by me too!)
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever played I love it I play it for hours at a time and like everyday
1419702203|5.0|I am one of millions who was ten years old in 1964 when the Beatles arrived in America and as a result directly inspired to buy and learn guitar which I play to this day.<br /><br />Thank you Olivia and to all that made this book and the film possible.  Both are a treasure in addition to the Concert for George.  In the end very little survives but our spirit and love which clearly, never fades away.<br /><br />Blessings
B007U1FEJE|5.0|After a long time of waiting something new from the gentlemen of the beach. A wonderful album with amazing harmonies. Thank you guys. Best songs: \\"From there to back again\\", \\"Isn´t it time\\" and \\"Spring vacation\\".<br />Greetings from Germany.
B00026WU82|5.0|Praising this album seems superfluous at this late date. Not only is it a signal achievement in modern popular music, it is probably the most important album Dylan recorded. While I might argue that [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] is a better album (and I do), it isn't as important, because it mainly harvests the seeds planted here. Born of Dylan's frustration with an arrogant recording industry, this album reoriented folk music from a lecturing tone to a remarkable introspection.<br /><br />Artists like John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix took many cues from this album. Hendrix did a truly remarkable \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" as part of his live set, and I can't hear \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" without hearing foreshocks of \\"The Wind Cries Mary.\\" And while Lennon did no explicit Dylan covers, \\"Tombstone Blues\\" clearly influenced \\"Come Together,\\" while \\"I Am the Walrus\\" feels almost plagiarized from the spirit of \\"Ballad of a Thin Man.\\"<br /><br />It's a shame so many young people, in this age of individual downloaded tracks, will never discover the pleasure of listening to a full album. Like Sergeant Pepper, this album is an integrated unit, and should be heard as such. In letting the complex profundity wash over me, I experience something like visiting a new and beautiful land, rich with the opportunity to discover something new. Every time I visit, I spot a new vista. I doubt this album will ever be played out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy version of this game.  Would recommend<br />to anyone addicted to this game.  The auto complete is great.  Just download it and you will be satisfied.
0345803485|1.0|I read through 25% of the book on my kindle and decided to return it. This is not literature and sounds more like a teenager writing about her crush on a boy.  The language is horrible and the characters too shallow.  The whole first quarter of the book is about how cute christian grey is and how turned on anna is by him.  It is very repetitive.  I got tired of her blushing and biting her lip! I can't believe that some actually kept on reading and more surprising, they actually gave it 5 stars!
B005723JSQ|5.0|I was skeptical of this book since it sounded so silly, but I was glad I bought it! It´s an easy read, fun, with enough twists to keep it interesting! I do recommend it, if you´re looking for an uncomplicated beach-read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a good game but I don't like that you have to buy every single little game you want to play. and then having to buy the expenise ones stinks Cu's if you don't like that mini game, you just wasted all those coins.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Absolutely brilliant production!  As an enthusiastic Phan of Phantom of the Opera, I can say that I love \\"Love Never Dies\\" just as much as Phantom.  Yes it's different than Phantom, as other reviewers have mentioned, and it's supposed to be. Superb casting of the Phantom, Christine and Meg in particular; and the young man who plays Gustav was excellent as well. I see a bright career ahead for this young man!  For me personally those were the standout performances in this production, but that isn't meant to detract from all other casting.  Musically you will hear overtones of Phantom of the Opera, but the original score from Love Never Dies by Andrew Lloyd Webber is fabulous - soul wrenching at times, eerie in some numbers, humorously entertaining in others.  As for the staging and costumes, I was very impressed also.  The final scene was definitely unexpected and a tear jerker for me.  Definitely a must own for Phans!  If you have the opportunity to see it on the big screen at special screenings in select movie theaters, definitely go, it's even more impressive!
B005R32L66|1.0|Installed app on tablet running on android 2.2 Froyo, hoping I would be able to use it while on vacation or to talk with relatives abroad. It will not work because it has no rear facing camera?????? Sounds strange to me, since by using the rear facing camera you can not see who you are talking! Seems an easy fix for SKYPE to me.
B0086700CM|5.0|The game is a lot of fun. There is absolutely no need to pay for extra gold so don't let the &quot;real money purchases&quot; hold you back.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a ton of fun. I play it for hours and it doesn't get old. The screen response is very accurate.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the music is relaxing.  The game itself is challenging yet not frustrating.  It is a nice way to zone out for a bit.  But be warned; like potato chips; it is difficult to play only one game!

B0087DFIYA|4.0|\\"To the untrained eye it looks as if crime pays doesn't it, but bear in mind for guys with my particular set of karmic could-be's there was bound to be a bump or two down the road.\\" After a car chase ends with Driver (Gibson) being caught be the Mexican police he is thrown in to their prison. Able to come and go as he pleases within the town he meets a nine year old boy who fills him in on the local people and problems. Wanting to get his money back from the corrupt cops Driver also decides help the young boy and his mother. I have to admit that I am a Mel Gibson fan. His last movie, \\"The Beaver\\" was outstanding and really was in unison with his personal meltdown. This movie, while not as good as that one still has some similarities to his life. This is about a man trapped and trying to not only help himself to straighten out, but also realizing that helping others is just a fulfilling. I may be reading too much into this and it may be just me though. The only down side is that after a string of great movies like \\"Edge Of Darkness\\" and \\"The Beaver\\" this one isn't quite that caliber. This is a good and entertaining movie though, just not at that level. Overall, a movie that has the feel of an Oliver Stone type movie that is fun to watch and is entertaining as well as violent. I recommend this. I give it a B+.

B007R9MFPU|5.0|I would have already reviewed this album weeks ago but no reviews were to be done on US Amazon until it was available. I got this out of the UK but as for the album, if you loved Ultravox in the day with the Midge Ure classic line-up then you'll love this comeback album. My personal favorites on it are \\"Change\\", \\"Hello\\", \\"One\\" & the title track. I recommend getting this album not because this band is from the 80's, because it is a solid album of tracks.  Give it a listen, it is really good.<br />Drop by my Website @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" sometime for a visit.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting from the brief summary of this book, but it completely blew away whatever it was. This is definitely a young adult novel; however, even in my mid-30s I loved every minute. I could not put this book down, and immediately picked up the sequel, Point of Retreat, which I felt the same way about. The character's raw emotions that the author so delicately describes brought me to tears more than once. I will definitely reread this one at a later date.
B000JMKO0A|5.0|As all the books written by Mr.Coelho EXCELLENT!!!! MR. COELHO know how to make me focus on 1 book and make me want to read another one!!!

B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was good a the beginning then towards the middle begins to make mad. But overall you need to read this book to tie into the third and it sets up the third book well. I love the series. Go Katniss!
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Although I was surprised at what the son ends up doing at school, it wasn't enough for me to give this movie more than 3 stars.  It is just an OK movie.  Things that kill the movie (no pun intended) are most definitely the soundtrack and the jump editing.  The lyrical content of the music is quite appropriate but the music itself is horrendously distracting and does not fit the mood of the movie nor any of the characters.  The editing style is nothing new, been there done that and I was glad that near the middle and end, they toned it down a bit and allowed each scene to somewhat breathe.  Another thing was, I kept waiting for this mother or this father to be real.  What mother would let a young child act the way this one does without ever once raising her voice or spanking or anyway in the least bit disciplining him.  Except for the one time she breaks his arm \\"by accident\\", she never once does any real parenting.  It's like watching someone act out one of these looney tunes liberal psychologist \\"time out, don't hurt the kids\\" BS methods of raising children.  In fact, if this were anything close to real life, when the kid starts to do somewhat right after she breaks his arm, that should have been a signal to mom and dad, that Kevin needs some constant attention by way of several ass whippings in order to make him behave.  Anyway, this movie is a bit boring, but it does have some redeeming value and is a decent enough flick to hold your attention if there is nothing else available to watch.  Otherwise, if you just have to watch a movie about evil children, The Good Son is a much better choice.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had an idea for a similar game a few years back after watching an indeana Jones movie. this game is the perfect combination of time waster and addiction starter. I have a few great ideas myself but no know how. contact me if you're interested in rapid expansion.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This is a great Blu-Ray for anyone who enjoyed the theatric version, basically extends some action sequences but you can enjoy the ending scene where John Hamm justifies his character, a sequence totally necessary for understand the movie.<br />The Maximum Movie Move is pretty entertaining and interesting, specially for someone who didn't see any MMM before (like me).
B004J4X73K|3.0|The main characters almost got boring to me this time, dissapointing since they're the main reason I like the books. This story is not about Alec and Seregil and their friends so much as it is a crime novel in a fantasy setting. Nice and all, but I hope there will be more books with more depth when it comes to character development.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Suggest reading the whole trilogy. Great job to the author. Re reading  them  soon. Can't wait for the movie.
B006OB3K56|3.0|The film-making is competent.  I saw nothing beyond that.  There is a sort of artsy switch between the majority of the film, which is shot in bleak, dark, harsh colors - and scenes of sexual encounters which are shot in colors of warmth, possibly through a filter which gives emphasis to that.<br />  The story being told is sad, very sad.  Bleak.  Hopeless.  Irreparable.  Another reviewer said that the elephant in the room is the untold story of how these people came to be this way.  If that is the case (and I have no problem with that interpretation), then the point of the film must be the horrific lifelong effects of such things.  I spent the last third of the film considering the question of whether these people would be better off dead.  Ultimately, the writer reveals a similar train of thought.  The people in the world who are in such a state seem to be beyond the reach of sympathy, pity, or attempts to give help.  The tone of the film is oppressively disheartening.  The film seems to be built in this way in order to better portray the life's condition of the central characters.
0984183523|5.0|This book gives you an invaluable insight of the Case Interview framework and of what management consulting firms look for. Easy reading and very well structured book.
B00884GR0W|1.0|down loaded an update and it will no longer open this app is ripoff do not download it isn't worth 1 cent
B0086700CM|4.0|the best game ever! I rated at 4stars because I like it better on the ipad2.... its a little bit slower on my kindle fire..overall I LOVE IT!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so amazing. If you are torn between getting it or not get it. You won't regret it!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Cons:<br />I was really excited when I found out that this new angry birds game was coming out. But I was disappointed when the free version wasn't available for the Kindle Fire. What??! No free one... or even a $.99 version? $2.99 is pretty expensive for a game, IMO. I waited and waited for a free version for Kindle Fire to come out, or at least a cheaper one, but it didn't. And I doubt it will! The company probably just wants more money from us Kindle Fire owners.<br />Anyway, I went ahead and got it finally. I'm not too happy with the price I paid for it (hence the 4 stars), but I just went ahead and got it anyway. I couldn't wait any longer to play it! ;)<br />One more thing, when are they going to add more levels? They should have put more levels in it before putting this game out. I completed all the levels in a few hours total. I want more, when will there be more levels??<br /><br />Pros:<br />The picture is really clear. It runs smoothly, with no glitches. Haven't had any problems with it yet. There are NO ads at all, which is great! It's as fun, (maybe even more fun!) than the original angry birds.<br /><br />The bottom line: If you don't care about the high price, and the fact that there are only three level packs (btw the last one has half as many levels as the others), then get it. It's really fun and a great time waster. The gravity feature makes it really hard and a challenge sometimes!!<br /><br />Anyway, hope my review helped somebody. If it did, then my work here is done. ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this app!  You run...avoid the pitfalls, and collect coins to upgrade your powerups.  You can buy more coins, but you are not required to do so.  It is very addictive...great way to pass the time.  Graphics are excellent too!  It is definitely worth playing...download asap!!!

B0080CL0HM|4.0|Unfortunately, this movie has not received the recognition and publicity it should have in the US.  Rob P did an excellent job I feel in portraying the scheming, sinister, Georges Duroy character.  To another reviewer - he is supposed to be smirking and just a devilish character and you are supposed to not like him - it's not bad acting - it's his character.  You need to read the book before you make such comments.  Christina Ricci and Uma Thurman did a great job in their performances as well. Uma' s portrayal of the quick witted and coy Madeleine Forestier was accurate and convincing as the book portrays.  Rob P. really comes out in this film as a serious actor - more so than playing a teenage vampire in his Twilight Saga.  People criticized him as well in that series stating he was an anorexic sickly looking vampire - again if they read the books they would know that Edward Cullen is supposed to be tall, slim and elegant in his movements - and he is dead so he's not supposed to be a big buff hunky looking character like his counterpart Jacob. READ THE BOOK PEOPLE!!! I would give this film 5 stars except I feel it skipped a lot of essential events and rushed through the story more quickly without the essential explanations portrayed in the book. In agreement with another reviewer, the English translation of the book is poorly done and the language not proper for the period.

0345803485|2.0|What can I say about this book....hmm...it was okay. Just okay. I'm not really sure what all the hype was about. I didn't find this book well written, I actually saw a typo or two.  It was a little bit repetitive and juvenile in some ways.  I heard that originally these stories were Twilight fan fiction.  I could indeed draw some parallels from Ana and Christian's personalities to Edward and Bella's.  Honestly, I can't understand how this book reached bestseller status.

0061743526|5.0|I read this growing up knowing that Lincoln had made the emancipation declaration and thereafter I thought, all slaves had been freed after the Civil War. I didn't know that there was such as thing as 'racial-segregation'.<br />It was in reading this book as a young girl that I realized then that racism did not end there. As a little girl I had seen Alex Haley's Roots and the rise of black power but I had no idea that Southern parts of the US did not move on with the times. To me we had Duke Ellington records, we loved Michael Jackson and Jimmy Hendrix and thought the rat pack with Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. as typical of modern America.<br />Reading the America less known through Harper Lee's eyes as a little girl brought home to me a dark side I never knew. We were West Coast trans-continental immigrants who moved to lower middle-class multi-racial neighborhood and couldn't imagine the backward South.<br /><br />Having read it then opened my eyes and changed me and my outlook forever towards, race, justice and even childhood. I took those lessons with me that season and together with Graham Green's The Quiet American and Leon Uris' Exodus have since continued to expand my understanding of the world by traveling and sharing with other people.<br /><br />No one who has read this can ignore the increasing racism and radicalism prevalent wi America's right today and not be harkened back.<br />As a measure, I am buying this book in French for my 15-year old daughter so she understands that once in America justice was not available for people of color. I want her to know that heroes come in all shapes and sizes and that it is principle that makes one.<br /><br />It could be the lawyer dad or the freakish son of the neighbors.

0545091020|4.0|Five stars for the book (unfortunately, the CD page reviews are combined with reviews for the book itself).<br /><br />Having already read and enjoyed the book, I am now more than halfway through listening to the book on CD.  It is a wonderful book to listen to - hearing it reminds me of just how well written book one is!  The narrator makes good use of inflection and has a clear voice. However, her voice variation pales, and her ability to do the male voices is weak (but she does a great Effie!). The narrator pretty much uses the same annoying, gutteral voice for each male character and, frankly, would have been better had she opted to not try to change voices at all.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I recommend the cd!  It will bring you back into the world of the Hunger Games all over again!
1451648537|2.0|Not an Apple product owner yet I admire this and other companies from afar and was interested enough to purchase  this behemouth.<br />IMHO this book wasn't edited even once. Maybe a rush to release so close after his death? I have rarely seen a biographer put page after page of his own personal negative OPINIONS about the person/subject and makes it come off at times like a petty gossip writer. . Isaacson makes the judgement the person interviewed about Jobs never arrived at.He assumes allot so therefore I have found skimming and gleaning information about the timeline and structure of this fascinating American company to be best for me. The author was not duly suited to handle such a subject and that is unfortunate for the reader.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Oh my gosh...i can't put this trilogy down!<br />I already ordered the movie on Walmart.com!<br />...and i'm not a teenaager! ...63 years young.<br />Enjoy!  You won't regret it!
B0086700CM|5.0|It's great, really like it, but it could use one thing. When you go to the store, before you buy something, it should say &quot;Are you sure you would like to buy this?&quot; I know it gets annoying, but accidentally bought something and lost all my money! And I had no clue it happened!<br />  Otherwise, the game is great! It's a nice time-waster, and fun to get the objectives and save up for new things! Great app!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just started this 4 days ago and it literally kicked my a** from day 1!  I was so sore the next day that I could barely walk, and every day has been more of the same.  I'm still on workout one because there are times when I have to push myself on some of the exercises to the point that I just want to stop, it's so hard.  I have done a lot of other workout DVDs and this one is simply the most effective in the shortest amount of time.  There are no breaks, no \\"marching it out\\" like so many of the other ones do.  You will feel awful during and after, but then you'll feel AWESOME after a few days!  Seriously, if you're on the fence about buying this DVD, just do it, you have NOTHING to lose but inches :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|There's nothing wrong with this app on my k.f. everything works great. and no, the puzzles aren't of cats only. you have to click on the shopping cart, scroll down and where it says FREE PUZZLES! they give you a good selection of puzzles. I enjoy this app very much :&gt;
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down! I thought it was fun and easy to read. It only gets better as you read the whole trilogy!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This app was totally worth every penny after reading the reviews I thought I would give the bane a go and trust the recess this is an awesome game
1423140591|3.0|This isn't a terrible read, but it's certainly not essential reading, and it's not as fun as the original Percy Jackson series. In a strange combination, this book is both darker and more forgettable than previous Percy Jackson books. (Maybe I'm just getting old, but I doubt I'll remember these new characters in six months.)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i love this game because u can actually earn credits plus its simple  and i hav nuthin else so hfhd hrh
1400163439|3.0|The writing is adequate; the story arc isn't. This might have been a good article, but it made for a mediocre book. There are plenty of anecdotes, but the overarching story is a bit AWOL.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite books ever! I fell in love with Will & Lake. It is not often that a book really shocks you... totally unexpected. LOVED every sentence!!
B007RX32XK|5.0|Alt-J (triangle/increment on a Mac) could be categorized as indie, but that doesn't seem fair. The experimental sound that this quartet created for \\"An Awesome Wave\\" is smooth and satisfying but not dominating to ward off the normal crowd. Expansive instrumentation and distinctive vocals will envelop you. From the opening track with use of piano and synthesizer you may try to find familiarity, but the following short a cappella intermission will throw that directly out the window.<br /><br />Vocal harmonies can be heard throughout the album to accompany some brilliant, albeit simple, guitar work. Sometimes we can feel that intricate instrumentation is needed to build a unique sound, but some artists have shown us differently and this is a prime example. However, I do not want to downplay the ingenious work on this album. You will be stunned.<br /><br />\\"An Awesome Wave\\" is easily one of the best albums of the year. What really sucked me in was the way everything flowed incredibly well from track to track--each so different and refreshing that you won't find yourself skipping back and forth to your favorites the first few times through.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. there is alot of fun games for all ages.everybody in my family loves this game. I think you should get it.
0345803485|5.0|Very intriguing read, some variety in some of the story would have been better but it didn't phase me! Keeps you waiting and wondering what is going to happen next. Make sure you have some time when you start reading it because you can't put it down!
1612130283|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey makes me want to think of about fifty ways to puke! That's because it makes me sick that Ms. James has passed off this poorly written, silly, purile tripe as \\"good writing\\".  Pu-leeze!  It's not sexy, the characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the sexy parts are NOT erotic OR sexy.  Ms. James has figured out she can rip-off pseudo-readers who think any mention of sex, no matter how poorly written, is titillating and \\"naughty\\".  Anastasia, the heroine, can't make up her mind about Christian, the cold, rich, commitment-phobe guy who just happens to want this idiot girl. He's RICH - why would he want HER? She's an adult woman with the immature thoughts and attitudes of a thirteen-year-old. (Oh, I forgot, I guess that's what rich, super-intelligent, handsome men want) And why would any real, thinking woman want him?  What a creep!  The writing is soooo bad, and the sex scenes aren't sexy, they're stupid.  What does the public usually read that makes them think this crud is good writing?  One person wrote,\\"Her dialogue is crisp, her prose poised, and her paragraphs well-parsed.\\"  You've got to be kidding!!!  What does that person usually read, \\"The Adventures of Beavis and Butthead\\"?  This James woman is laughing her ass off all the way to the bank (with millions!) Hey, maybe that's how Christian got rich.  That would explain a lot!  Although, I must say, she has put in a lot of hard work to be such a appallingly terrible writer.  I don't think I could write that badly if I tried.  It's sort of like those contests for \\"Write the Most Terrible Prose You Can Think Up\\" and actually selling it! Gee, I 'm so tempted to churn out some trash myself just to see how much junky writing the public will actually swallow, and pay for!  It makes me \\"blanch\\" to think about it!  Or is it \\"blush\\"?
0345803507|5.0|The end of the third leaves me hoping there is a fourth! So many twists and turns it keeps you interested the whole way through!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this game is that many of the puzzles are too big to enjoy on a phone screen.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe my eyes I have been playing it on my sisters phone but wen I came to the app store today I was so shocked and happy at the same time!!!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! Couldn't put it down until I'd read every last word! Fall in love with the characters and get sucked into their world. Hopefully  many more to come in this series!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game just add more boards &amp; im glued!! I was so excited when this game was added to the android market because i first played it on a iphone!
B00845PV16|4.0|This may not be up for any awards any time soon, but it was really fun to watch.  I agree with other reviews that they could have done better with these movies, but dont let that stop you from just enjoying it for what it is; a high intensity, visually stimulating, action packed good time!
0897500482|5.0|Anyone with an interest in Martial Arts, and even just those wanting to know more about Bruce Lee will benefit from reading this book.<br /><br />My original copy of this book sadly disappeared during the \\"divorce\\" years, but I think this version would have been worth the price of admission even if I still had possession of the original.<br /><br />As a Reality Based Self Defense instructor and holder of belts in multiple Martial Arts I particularly appreciate the knowledge imparted in this book. I highly recommend owning this book and am fairly certain it is the first 5 star review I have ever granted.
0345803485|4.0|Simply cannot stop reading this. Being in the sunshine on the beach makes it even more thrilling and tantalising. A page turner for sure. Not that brilliantly written but the story-line is a fab escape from everyday life
0525478817|5.0|Very interesting book that might be considered about cancer, but is more about two teens overcoming adversity through<br />unusual friendships. Great metaphors and appealing to teens. Humor and sarcasm well placed. I taught it in a 10th grade class and we could have done so much with it if we had time.
0439023521|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the first of these 3 books. So much so I went straight on to the 2nd one, Catching Fire. Brilliantly written, action packed and full of emotion. Vowed NOT to watch the film until I've finished the book trilogy
B0026BD2GK|5.0|When I realize that no one had heard of Santana and their unique style of jazz, rock, Latin fusion or even every attempoted it, this debut is facinating here at Woodstock. The debut SANTANA album enclosed in the sleeve is also a bonus, a big one. The studio album is bright fresh and energetic. I was too young to appreciate it at the time so I had never purchased it. Boy am I sorry that I missed that one so many years ago. At 56 yrs old I must humbly say that I am still learning.<br /><br />The one cut on the woodstock album of Soul Sacrifice alway had me spellbound form the firs time I heard it on the original Woodstock album. I had alway wanted to know what the whole set would have sounded like sometime and now I have had the oppurtunity. Man it sounds every bit as good as the album. They announce a few songs from the stage as if nobody's ever heard Evil Ways and such. It's  TRUE, nobody HAD ever hear it but man it' blows me away just thinking that the guys had to be playing their heart out at thee time, young, dumb and inexperienced. SANTANA proved that jazz, rock, and latin beat can definitely mesh and a spellbind ig way. I AM not sorry that I purchased this package and would definitely recommed this to anyone who was turned on by the power of the original performance on the Woodstock album.
043902353X|5.0|Book came in new condition. It arrived in time specified. Very happy with purchase. Now I need to read the book so I can move on to the next:)
B00881VLCE|5.0|puzzle pieces and the area they are stored in are too small. almost impossible to 'pick up' a piece w/o clicking on ad.<br /><br />Would probably work well on a tablet.
B00472NZDQ|5.0|I'm only in the 1st few chapters and love it.<br />His stuff is interesting and keeps the attention as always.
B0049985XW|5.0|Unlike one of the other reviews, the disc for the product did arrive and was indeed the movie.  It was exactly what I thought I had ordered, with my favorite scene where ithe bandit don't hsve to show me no stinkin' badges.  I saw one of the bad reviews for the Blu-Ray version and won't order that.  I doubt that hi-def would make much difference on a 1948 black and white movie .  This one will look just fine on your new flat panel TV.  It is immensely satisfying to own this classic cult movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I actually thought this game to be a lot of fun...kit is a great way to make the time go by when waiting on your turn for the doctor...
0307594165|5.0|The main character is Frank, a twenty-four year old African American veteran of the US Army in Korea.  He is confused, angry, guilty and adrift in a deeply racist country from which he is estranged.  We are given fragments of his life as he travels across the country to rescue his sister, Cee, after receiving a letter saying \\"Come fast.  She be dead if you tarry.\\"<br /><br />I found Frank, as presented by the narrator, to be less than three-dimensional.  I can certainly understand that one can be both dangerously angry, barely under control, yet at the same time be introspective and deliberate, but the jerky juxtapositions of these contrasting facets of his personality didn't gel for me.  Frank never comes alive.  But what his travels and thoughts did accomplish was to vividly frame the world of his childhood, and this provided the necessary background for the very powerful, and completely successful description of a rural tiny town inhabited by a few poor African American families.  As children Frank and his buddies couldn't wait to leave the boring town, and eagerly enlisted, one of the only options available.  Cee leaves the town for similar reasons.<br /><br />The two were raised by their strict grandmother who insisted that they adhere to standards and customs that had nothing to do with where or how they were actually living.  Aspire for better, they were instructed, defined as little more than more money, more possessions.  Spiritually this left them adrift and confused.  Until Frank returns to the town with the gravely ill Cee we share Frank's alienation from the town.  After you have been to large cities, seen the world, it is difficult to return to a tiny town with no paved streets and no work other than working long hard days with your body picking and lifting.  The reader feels that Frank and Cee have failed in their quest to escape to a bigger, better world.<br /><br />At that exact moment what I refer to as the hidden short story gloriously emerges.  Because first Frank, and then when she is better, Cee, realize that this town is filled with magical women who understand life, and what is important.  They have watched Frank and Cee flounder about as kids, but there was nothing they could do.  Only by going out into that bigger world with its illusions of more equals better could they learn to appreciate what is important.  And they did.<br /><br />Frank realizes that this town is home.  A place where he can simply relax without fear.  \\"Time to roll a cigarette just so, time to examine vegetables with the eye of a diamond cutter.  And time for old men to gather outside a storefront and do nothing but watch their dreams go by; the gorgeous cars of criminals and the hip-sway of women.\\"  And Cee? She is nursed back to life by the women of the town.  \\"Those weeks at Miss Ethel's house, surrounded by those women with seen-it-all eyes.  Their low expectation of the world was always on display.  Their devotion of Jesus and one another centered them and placed them high above their lot in life.\\"  It centers Cee also.  By the end of the book we are relieved to see that Frank is relatively safe and settled, but we confidently know that Cee will be the Miss Ethel of the next generation, assuring that the soul of that town, and its folk, are loved, respected and safe.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have this on my Kindel. It is well written with an easy flow that grabs your attention and you find yourself so engrosed that you find it hard do stop reading. I would recomend it to all my friends.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game completely. But when jumping at times it freezes then starts to work again after you fall which makes me run into obstacles. That is the only &quot;turn off&quot; this game has for me.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|Great product, exactly what I expected. Only complaint is no episode guide. I have to go online to see the episode numbers and read the synopsis.
B005ZUR724|5.0|At first I thought that this game would not be all that but the game was amazing the grafics was not bad. If you like war and adventure then this game is for you.
0525478817|5.0|This book was so good. It made me laugh and made me cry. John Green is one of my favorite authors.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|This is, quite simply, a fast, fierce, aggressive record from this band. It combines the musicial intricacies of Demanfacture with the solid, crystal-clear production effort of Mechanize to provide something powerful. Fast riffs, excellent drumming (though it all comes from a drumming machine, which is hard to duplicate in real-life, unless you were that good as a drummer), and Burton's vocals are clean, yet growling when appropriate. A couple of tracks are filler, namely When Religion Is Flawed and Human Augmentation, but the rest of the tracks were quite pleasant to hear. This is a solid metal effort and worth the money, so if you're a huge fan of Fear Factory or just want more metal in general, you can't go wrong with Fear Factory's The Industrialist!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been following this program for several weeks. I love it. I have had strength gains every week, and I'm seeing muscles and definition I haven't seen in years.<br /><br />There isn't anything really new here. What this book does is brings everything I was looking for into one place for easy reference.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|free cool app..  simple games that keep you entertained just to see what the next game you can unlock.  nice to be able to unlock games without spending real money.

B007ZKY7XO|4.0|(Taken from my blog Junk in a Cup @ [...])    What can I say about the Scissor Sisters' fourth effort Magic Hour? At first listen I felt a bit confused because the album plays like a mixtape instead of an official release.  It seems totally out of place in the catalogue of their work.  After the second listen, though, I had that slight head bob and shoulder action I get when I'm warming up to something.  By the third or fourth time around I was in full dance mode with hands in the air and all.    With that said, don't expect a cohesive album like the previous club friendly Night Work.  Instead expect an album with less cohesion but that is still a solid body of work.  Because it plays like a mixtape, you will find yourself skipping around.  Let's start with the unbearable \\"The Secret Life of Letters\\".  Although it's a ballad at the end of the album, and you sometimes want to wind down after partying on an otherwise danceable album, this song just flat out puts you to sleep.  What makes it even worse is that the meaning of this song is almost incomprehensible.  Next is the abysmal \\"San Luis Obispo\\".  This song just has no personality what so ever, so there's no need to discuss it.  Yes it's that bad.    Besides a couple of downers, Magic Hour has some very delightful uppers that will have you pressing rewind over and over again.  The opening track \\"Baby Come Home\\", which has a background vocal and piano feature by John Legend, is very addictive and is almost impossible to not sing along to.  The infectious \\"Shady Love\\" and \\"Keep Your Shoes On\\" are guaranteed party starters, with the former showcasing Jake Shears' pop rap abilities.  The ballads \\"Only the Horses\\" and \\"Somewhere\\" have that sense of epicness that is only worthy of being played live in stadiums.    Overall Magic Hour is a great release.  Even though it feels out of place in their catalogue, it works to their advantage.  Who wants an album to sound that the previous three bodies of work.  This album proves that the Scissor Sisters have staying power and can make great club songs as well as great ballads while mixing many genres and musical eras together.
0307951529|5.0|This book is full of helpful information on how to create and grow a business. I love the interesting stories explaining how regular people, just like me, are doing what they love. This is a practical book that explains how to you can make more than enough money to live off of as while following their dreams. This is a quick and easy read. I also appreciate all the free worksheets on his website 100startup.com.
1455160474|5.0|This was a great book and interesting subject.  A real eye opener about how things are in North Korea. I would strongly recomend reading this book to all americans.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After all the hype this book created I thought I'd take a look and see what the big commotion was about. I wasn't real into the book until about 40% through and then there started to be some more story intertwined into the pages and pages of sex. Seventy percent of the way through and I could NOT put the book down. If you can get past the graphic details and still enjoy the storyline on another level then you will love it. If anything, read this one so you can read the other two because they are GREAT!<br /><br />P.s. It can be quite romantic at times... Who doesn't like that? :)
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Ok, I have rated the first book 3 out of 5 stars. The writing was bad and the story got repetitive. However, I went on to read the second and third book and I thought they did get better (when it comes to the story, not the writing unfortunately). I liked that there's more plot points and the other characters are included more, it's not just sex scenes between the two main characters. If you hated the first book, stop reading...if you found it entertaining I suggest picking up the next 2 books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If I was pressed to compile a short list of my favorite books, Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus would certainly be on it.<br /><br />Being a knitter, crocheter, and weaver the title caught my eye while perusing \\"recommended\\" Kindle books. Wool? What's not to like? So, even though I'd never heard of the series, I gave it a try. It didn't take much for me to be completely tangled up in the story, completely hooked. I was on pins and needles trying to figure out who might be the next person to do a little light housework.<br /><br />I am hoping to see this movie on the big screen before long. Rumor has it that a certain famous director has cast on for this project. I'm hoping it doesn't end up in a pile of UFOs (unfinished object, in knitting terms)!
B0061S073A|5.0|Just what I was looking for! This is a great app for controlling app access on the Kindle Fire. My only complaint is having to exit out completely in order to change system settings. However, this app (especially the timer function) has proven invaluable on multiple occasions both on the road and at home with the family.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game reminds me of the Oregon Trail floppy disk game I used to play in my childhood, but it is much more for fun! The style is pretty much like any social network game, and its not the kind of game you can play constantly, rather its fun to check every hour or everyday.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love this game... it's very entertaining appropriate for most ages.  I can go hours playing it and wont get bored.
B00846REIS|2.0|The first couple of sex scenes were quite hot, but got repetitive and boring after a while, especially with the female character orgasming at the drop of a hat. I ended up skipping the later sex scenes because instead of pleasure, they became a chore to read.<br /><br />The way she got upset at every little thing tired me as well; just because she might be \\"justified\\" for acting that way didn't mean it wasn't annoying.<br /><br />I keep hoping I'll find a published erotica that is better and hotter than the fanfics I've been reading, and I keep getting disappointed. I don't think I'll be buying the other books in this series, even though I'm mildly interested in what happened in the male character's past.
0399536108|5.0|This will help you begin to think in the way the change-makers, artists and freedom-lovers of the world do on a daily basis. Read this, if you crave that life.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Being someone who has been involved with computers and the internet for more than 25 years and a Apple fangirl for the past 6 years, I considered this a must read.  This is not only the biography of a brilliant, driven, colorful man, it chronicles the history of personal computing and the major players that shaped our experiences today into tomorrow.<br /><br />This book gives us a closeup look at the man responsible for many of the innovations that we take for granted today and we get to learn how he did what he did but also WHY.  This book is fascinating and occasionally funny and shows us how far we've come in the last 30 years.<br /><br />I could not put this page turner down.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is one of the more addictive games ive come across and am glad I found it free. prepare to be frustrated every time you die. at first its a lot. as you get used to it... its still a lot :P
B0086700CM|4.0|I think it is a good game but pauses and one time on was so close to beating my high score then it paused and I lost and u was mad
0547569653|4.0|As a non-runner, I cannot even begin to imagine what it would be like to run 150 miles in 24 hours--or at least I could not imagine it before I read this book. Jurek provides an intriguing glimpse into the world of ultramarathons and veganism. The writing is kind of all over the place and repetitive, but it's worth reading anyway because it's so amazing to think of what people can do when they discipline their minds and bodies. I especially like that Jurek describes everything exactly as he saw and felt it at the time, without too much filtering. A great read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for temple run to come out for Kindle fire and finally it came out I am so happy now I play it all the time
B005LAIIS0|4.0|I'm rather surprised by all the negative reviews this little film has gotten. Between the frighteningly loony animal rights activists and those turned off by the dark nature of the story, The Grey can't seem to catch a break, which is a real shame. For something that, by all means, should have been okay at best, The Grey manages to be a flawed, yet pretty compelling film. Joe Carnahan hasn't made a good film since NARC, and it's awesome to see something watchable coming from him. Liam Neeson plays himself for the most part, and yet he fits the movie quite nicely with Frank Grillo doing a surprisingly good job infusing some life into a character that could've very well been awfully bland. Again, it's not a perfect movie, but it's certainly doesn't deserve the hate it's been getting from critics and audiences alike.<br /><br />One thing I would like to point out is that the negative reviews often highlight the gore and themes as the reason they are rating the film poorly. It was obvious from the start that this wasn't going to be the feel good movie of the year, and it's ridiculous to hate a movie because it made you sad. Often times, that's the point. Stick to Disney movies if a movie depressing you is enough for you to condemn it. For those of you looking for an interesting film with a good cast, great cinematography, and one of the better endings to come out of Hollywood in the last couple of years, I wholeheartedly suggest you find and watch The Grey as soon as you can. It may make you sad, maybe even angry, but it's worth it in the end.
B0086700CM|4.0|everyone was playing it so I thought I would give it a try. a good way to kill some time.
1466401885|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews I wasn't sure I would like this book, but since I wasn't looking for this to become the next classic novel I really enjoyed it. Beautiful Disaster was a great book to relax with to get my mind out of the everyday grind. If you liked \\"Fifty Shades\\" you will like this.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is about time Temple Run was released for for Kindle. I thought that they would never do it. You know it's a great game when it has over 5K reviews more than half rating it 5 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun. the one time I played this for 40 minutes straight. you should just try it and if you don't like this game delete it win win situation.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Individual works in this series can be a bit up or down. The good ones can be very good, the worst are terrible. Sometimes the plots are just puerile but this was a good story that moved along at a fast pace with sustained tension and some clever plot developments. There are still some annoying elements, things like a visit to the Pentagon, Reacher sees someone in civies \\"probably an analyst\\" at least half the people at the Pentagon wear civies! Its probably a clerk or a mailman, they outnumber \\"analysts\\" ten fold, but those sorts of mistakes are very few in this book. It's a good read, worth recommending.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best of the Hunger Games series. Once I started,it was difficult to put down. I wish the series could continue!
B0086700CM|5.0|good game. i love this game. if you enjoy games with some challenges then you will love this game. get this game!
067144901X|5.0|My 8 month old starts laughing when he sees the cover. He LOVES this book. The author knew what she was doing when writing this book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very relaxing. great test of the mind through a calm and peaceful game. works great on kindle fire.. no complaints
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. If you're reading this review and haven't bought the book yet, BUY IT!
B0086700CM|3.0|I just got my kindle and all of my friends recommended this hams but it wont let me get it!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok it keeps me occupied while I'm at work bored so it does the job. I would recommend it to others to download n play.
0545265355|5.0|This is the best fiction book ever written! First I read it on my kindle, and then I liked it so much I had to buy the first book. I bought it in paper back and I read it so many times over and over it began to tear up, so I got this! It's great quality so I don't think it will ever tear up and it came very quickly. Real or not real?
B0086700CM|5.0|people u must get this app it great. one of my favorites.<br />who wouldn't like this game its awesome.<br /><br />  BUY this app now
B00008976Y|2.0|You would expect a movie with Binosh to be serious, arty, and pretentious, and you won't be disappointed. The story is extremely slow and rambling, and i get the feeling that the script writer had no idea what would happen next and just kept making things up as he went along.
B007OTZ654|5.0|Hello long suffering Bowie fans. How many Ziggy releases have you bought, hoping that this great record would sound like ... music? Thank you 2012 remaster. Mick's guitar rings clear and drives hard, bass is tight and articulate, keyboards sound like keyboards, drums pop, and Bowie, well, rocks like crazy. Finally.<br /><br />As for the album itself, does TRAFOZSATSFM need another heap of accolades? I never tire of it. It's one of the greats. But you knew that.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|entertaining and heart-warming though morally deplorable. . .<br /><br />i like the actors and the script, and i find the story heart-warming. My only problem is that the movie after all romanticizes adultery.<br /><br />i still recommend strongly.
B006IDG2T6|1.0|Read this review and save yourself a massive disappointment. If you are looking for an opinion piece with practically no research to back up the author's claims, then this is your book. If you are like me and believe and rejoice in reading experimental findings to back up (extraordinary) claims, then do yourself a favor and ignore this book.<br /><br />For a more researched (and far more exhilarating) read on this topic, pick up Cordelia Fine's \\"A Mind of its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives\\" --- it's a wonderful little book.<br /><br />\\"Free Will\\" might have made an entertaining op-end on the New Yorker but it's not worthy of a book. It was particularly more painful for me to read \\"Free Will\\" having just finished Dawkins' \\"The Greatest Show on Earth,\\" a masterpiece of evidence and elegance.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Mind-its-Own-Distorts-Deceives/dp/0393062139
B007ZKY7XO|3.0|Don't you hate it when you hear a new album by an artist or a band you love, and are underwhelmed?<br /><br />Since their first album, the Scissor Sisters have always combined campy playfulness with reflective, heartfelt music. On their last album, \\"Nightwork,\\" the songs seemed to blend these elements seamlessly, and the band created sexy, often sinister, and sometimes downright epic songs like \\"Invisible Light\\" and \\"Something Like This.\\"<br /><br />With \\"Magic Hour\\" the songs are all almost completely polarized. They're either complete disco camp (\\"Keep Your Shoes\\", \\"Let's Have a Kiki\\") or mellow pop-rock (\\"Baby Come Home\\", \\"Best in Me\\"). Not only that, but the two types of tracks are often ordered sort of randomly, so that one minute Jake Shears is crooning romantically, and the next he's engaging in filthy porno rap. (Btw, when did Jake Shears start rapping? Has he been listening to a lot of Peaches lately?) It all comes across as kind of disjointed.<br /><br />It's not that the songs are bad ... they're just not the band's best work. Luckily, the album closes with two strong tracks, the philosophical \\"The Secret Life of Letters\\" and the soaring, glorious \\"Somewhere.\\" The later reminds the listener that the Scissor Sisters are at their best when they combine their love of the dance floor with emotional vocals.

B000JQUGVI|4.0|Written as a serial, the length of Vanity Fair is offputting at first, but is worth the read. If you haven't read it before, do so. It's a good history lesson. On a kindle, it goes on for a long long time. In book form, the print is exceedingly small and pages run to over 800. The writing is delightful, opens windows on the culture of the era, and gives an excellent rendition of society \\"of the day.\\"
159102594X|2.0|Heard a lot of good things about Abercrombie's work and so was very excited to start on this one. For a while at least it didn't disappoint, but eighteen chapters later my enthusiasm and interest had waned to such a huge degree that I had to give up. I was actually really annoyed because Joe is on the whole a great writer with a well realised fantasy world and some pretty decent central characters, but the basic problem is that they just don't do very much, and for the most part aren't really driven to do much either. There's Logan, an old time warrior from the north (and his pot) who gets separated from his companions and travels around with seemingly little of an agenda. There's Luther, a fairly hapless nobleman who gets endlessly disciplined by his fencing teacher whilst contending with his growing feelings for the sister of a friend, and an inquisitor called Glokta who spends most of his time covertly obtaining confessions for a higher power. And to be honest, aside from the arrival of some Northmen to the King's palace demanding ownership of a part of the Union's land, and an upcoming tournament (where presumably our hapless swordsman will Robin Hood the lot of them) that's about it. There's no real discernible story arc for any of the principle characters, or the book itself except for the fact that Logan will inevitably be reunited with his buddies, and that Luther will undoubtedly fight the scary northman and win the tournament. This isn't a bad thing neccessarily, so long as there's enough page-turning intrigue conflict or excitement to keep you reading while these things develop, but this is where it falls down. Whilst the characters are interesting enough, and have decent potential, they're just not given much opportunity to fulfil it, and even when those opportunities come, the intrigue just too weak or obvious to be effective, and any sense of excitement is always numbed by the lack of a genuine sense of immediate threat or danger. The characters all feel a little bit indestructible (even the already partially destructed Glokta) and a little bit too unsympathetic to really garner much in the way of support or sympathy and when you stick them into a world, where basically nothing happens, it's all a bit muted and uninspiring. This combined with some overly long scenes about the ins and outs of trade tenures, history of the house of questions, disputes and taxation that all have little narrative value, really drag the pace to a near standstill in parts. Fortunately Abercrombie's sense of scene and realism, and some punchy dialog always manages to just keep you hanging in through these bits.<br /><br />This leads me on to the good bits. For starters Abercrombie writes well; he captures visuals and paints pictures brilliantly, and with the exception of some (thankfully rare) parts where he uses dialog to have one character recount another character's history to the reader, writes some really great dialog. It's dark too, humourous in parts, and quite brutal but all of this was always within character and context which is refreshing. Definitely not a book for younger readers, however. That said, occasionally he goes a bit overboard (describing someone falling down the stairs in a page and a half) and gets a bit repetitive (I lost count of the times that Glokta licked his gums, or did something that was painful) and he occasionally lapses into some horrible conversational beats like 'his eyes bulged', 'he thumped the table with his fist' or the odd unintentionally amusing pov like 'at least his foot was okay. He would need his foot if he was to get out to this.' These things were extremnely infrequent though, and didn't detract from what was (despite its narrative shortcomings) a pleasure to read. In fact comparing Abercrombie to some of the other horrible authors that seem to get published in the fantasy genre these days, it was like reading Shakespeare.<br /><br />So whilst it wasn't really for my particular sensibilities, this will definitely appeal to people who perhaps like a good character based medieval-style fantasy and definitely one to be considered by George Martin fans. But do be warned, unlike Martin's immense multi-threaded dramas, this one is not going to keep you up at nights turning pages. Think of it more as a kind of slow paced 'upstairs downstairs' kind of fantasy with some dental torture thrown in for good measure.

0439023513|3.0|I purchased the Hunger Games trilogy because  I found out that it was being taught in Junior High English classes, and, as a teacher, I wanted to see what kids were reading these days.  I read them all to get the whole story.  They're ok, but all are a great deal more violent than I would recommend for the target audience - 12 - 14 year olds.  Mockingjay, in particular,  is very brutal and violent.  I would recommend that parents read these books before turning them over to their young teens.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and I play it a lot but the lag pisses me off because I tell it to jump and it does nothing but that's the only downfall to the game

B003O86FMW|5.0|a very good part of the 3 part series. i would read it again and probably will. the series is captavating and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book didn't live up to the hype. I've read more creative writing.  Takes a while since you keep hoping for it to get better. It doesn't

0439023521|4.0|I saw the movie first. Yes I know taboo really. But I had grown sick and tired about hearing how great this book was. It was becoming the new Twilight and I couldn't stand it. (That being said see the movie first, more suspense really). Now the book. This is a sleek and fast read. I really didn't want to like this book and by the end of chapter one I was cursing how good this book was. The hype is understandable, this is a brutal story with a fantastic underlying commentary.<br /><br />The story is, as most everyone knows by now, about Katniss Everdeen. A young girl from district twelve. One of the desolate districts where finding dinner is a challenge. She volunteers for her sisters place in the hunger games. A worldwide event in which twenty four kids between twelve and eighteen fight to the death for glory and the entertainment of the capital. This was a horrible summary but it's all I've got at the moment.<br /><br />The story is fast and has a great pace leaving the reader wondering where the last few hours had gone. Collins does a great job making this book accessible and as endearing to adults as well as to the teens it's aimed at. It's not your average young adult novel and it's heaps and bounds better than most out there. The hype is worth it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game just wish didn't need cash to buy stuff I will recommend it to friends and family its great fun
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is a fun mix of some of my all-time favorite logic puzzles with a few new things thrown in. Most of the games are challenging enough to be interesting, a few are ridiculously easy, and a couple are very difficult (and frustrating.) I'm not a fan of hidden object games, and Azada thankfully has very little of that. The graphics, music, and special effects are nicely designed. Basically, if you're looking for a moderately challenging game that you can still kick back and relax with, this is it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game for the Kindle Fire!!!! You can mess with the sensitivity level which stops all the lagging....

B003Z0FSDQ|5.0|I think this is one of the best post-sellout albums by The Cure.  Of all the albums after \\"The Top\\" this and \\"Kiss me, Kiss me, Kiss me\\" are the only ones worth buying.
B004G600A4|5.0|After watching Wall~E I, lost interest in the many Disney films.  My kids are both grown up, and we just lost interest in Disney Films.  This last Christmas we were my Mother's house and she rented Tangled. I had heard about the movie earlier, and how so many people enjoyed this film.  I thought,OK, I'll give it a shot. Wow, what a wonderful and funny movie, we were all laughing and enjoying it soo much, I could'nt believe that Rapunzel was a Disney Film, I was expecting this to be more of a Dreamworks film. Rapunzel, and Flynn Rider were great, and I was so happy that Maximus and Pascal did't talk.  Action were greater than words with these two sidekicks.  The other characters were fantastic as well.  After we got home, the next week I bought the DVD and never regretted it.  Disney has finally made a very enjoyable movie for me and my family to enjoy all over again.  If your looking for a fun family movie for kids and adults alike, please watch this move, you won't regret it.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|The power of this record is incredible. What more can one say? It is rock and roll distilled to its essence and grown again as something gorgeously malignant. The very definition of the music itself.
B0067LXQAW|3.0|I am a huge Cranberries fan, but this album was a real disappointment.  It is a nice listen, but there are no songs that really jump out with lyrics or sound.  After waiting so long for a new release, it should have been better.
0345803485|1.0|I don't know what the fuss was all about this book. After a 5-6 chapters I'm was ready to put the book down and never look at it again. But I still read it to the end hoping it will get better. It didn't. The author has a very simple way of writing that makes me think she's in highschool. I'm very disappointed. Why is it a best seller? Who knows?!?!
B007MJ9LA2|2.0|Here we go again ANOTHER LOUD CD. I can't listen to this stuff anymore. It's LOUD, BORING ,NO DYnamICS, and after about 2 songs I can't listen anymore.It's bad enough that they are ruining new artists, but now they're ruining old ones.I can't honestly say how the music is because I can't get far enough into the CD.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|Pocahontas is a true story.  maybe not how hollywood tells it.  this is a great story lets young kids see how the world was like back then.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Great movie!  I have been an ERB fan since my teenage years and was very excited when I heard that Disney was doing this movie.  I can't believe it did so poorly at the box office.  The movie follows the book fairly close.  The changes/additions that were made do not distract from the original story line that much.  After watching this movie I was only saddened by the fact that there probably won't be a sequel made.  There are 10 books in the John Carter of Mars series and each one would make a great movie!
B004EPZ07U|5.0|this movie is funny at parts and serious at others.  in this movie you see paradox what a nasty enemy.  my brother in law and brother both said at the end of the credits it shows you sinestro i hope i spelled it right.  putting on the yellow ring.
0062197258|5.0|Elizabeth Haynes's \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" is an edgy psychological thriller about domestic violence and its aftermath.  Before Cathy Bailey meets a cop named Lee Brightman in 2003, she is self-confident, sociable, and carefree.  However, after she starts dating Lee, Cathy's sense of well-being gradually fades; it turns out that this gorgeous and likable man is skilled at hiding his true nature.<br /><br />In 2007, Cathy lives alone and has a good job, but she is severely obsessive-compulsive, suffers from post traumatic stress, and experiences crippling panic attacks.  On the plus side, a handsome and single psychologist named Stuart moves into the flat upstairs and offers to help her.<br /><br />\\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" stands out because of the brilliant way in which the author frames her narrative.  Cathy tells her story in the first person as Haynes moves back and forth in time.  The author poignantly contrasts Cathy's behavior before and after her peace of mind was shattered.  We are dismayed that this formerly easygoing woman now feels obliged to check her locks and windows six or more times and engages in a host of other time-consuming rituals.  We sympathize all the more because we have grown to understand how she became this way.<br /><br />Haynes has complete mastery of her material.  She keeps the action moving forward until the past and present collide.  Cathy will need tremendous resolve and inner fortitude to fight a deceptive tormentor who can be charming, clever, and persuasive.  On the other hand, if Cathy does nothing, she may once again become a victim.<br /><br />The suspense is excruciating until it becomes difficult to turn the pages for fear of what might happen.  \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" is mesmerizing, erotic, and unsettling.  Readers will empathize with Cathy and applaud her courage.  In order to regain her mental health, defeat an implacable foe, and connect with the one man who loves her unconditionally, Cathy must stand up for herself and conquer her crippling fears.lf and conquer her crippling fears.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|It took a few tracks to grow on me but by mid-album I was mentally comparing it to the brooding atmospherics of \\"Tonight's the Night\\", the crunching guitars of \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" and the timely topicality of \\"Ohio.\\" Not as great as those classics, but destines to rank high in Neil's pantheon. Easily his best in two, maybe even three, decades. Special bonus: Neil resurrects the original \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" as the pro-99% protest anthem Woody Guthrie intended it to be.
0316017930|4.0|The book was recommended in a class that I was taking called \\"Skillful Teaching\\"....it's different from a lot of the self-help and self-improvement books (y-a-w-n!!!) that are on the market, rather it's the story of many different factors that make the difference between success and disaster.  I'm not quite finished with it yet, but I'm very glad I'm reading it. I recommend it highly, especially to teachers or trainers, anyone in the human resource field.  Not difficult or technical in the least :-)
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I give credit to those who actually finished the book. I forced myself to read 60% of the way through this book when I finally gave up because it was going nowhere. The main guy, Travis was a sexy and mysterious bad boy every good girl fantasizes about but the author soon turned him into a hot headed whimp. Their relationship was so dysfunctional and not even in an intriguing way but just silly arguments and whining galore! I get the book was for YA but what a poor example of what a relationship should be like. Returned it and gave up on the Disaster that it was.
B006VA57CY|5.0|when i saw episode one, i immediately prceeded to purchase the whole of season 1&2! its so well done, all the actors were superb, and i love maggie smith as the stoic matriarch, she plays that so well! i watched the whole of season 1 in one sitting,which takes a while but there was no dull moment for me, just enough comedy/drama/romance to make it a good watch for me.lots of the time i wanted to ring lady marys neck though ahaha, definetly a good show for those who like BBC tv series, i can tell you what, ill definetly be buying the rest of the seasons :)

B0052VUNHC|3.0|I will have to agree with most, this book isn't the best book of the last 10 I have read. Was it terrible? No, not really. It just hit a big nerve, I have been in relationships like Abby. In realy life they are scary and not so romantic. However, in fantasy book land it was ok to read about. It was an easy way to pass the evening.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book and waited impatiently for it to arrive. Everyone was talking about how great it was so I had ot get my hands on it. I love a good read. I've never been so disappointed.<br /><br />This was the WORST book I have ever read. There is absolutely nothing to it besides a lot of descriptive sex scenes. I'm not a prude by any means but I like to be entertained and this was literary porn which I don't find very entertaining. It's written exactly like a porn movie. No real story, just sex. The characters are annoying. Ana is constantly flushing and I'm tired of her conversations with her \\"inner goddess\\". Christian always has his hands in his hair. The situations are unrealistic. Ana immediately goes from being a virgin to being in a submissive in a BSDM relationship. Christian is supposed to be CEO of his company but by the amount of time he spends obsessing over Ana, when does he ever work?<br /><br />Now I think about all the women I've heard ranting and raving about this book remind me of a bunch of young kids giggling while flipping through the pages of their dad's Playboy magazine they just found. It's pathetic.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This the worst in the series so far. Realy you portray Katniss as a drunkard?! Susan you got to do better than this. This is so freaking terible. So you make a  charecter  that was a tree , STUPID NEVER do that this book was not at all good till the end! I do realy think Susan could do better. Burn down districk 12 great idea NOT. I don't think having a new peace keeper is the best you couid do.<br /><br />  Thankyou
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I had the same problem, I'm not sure if this will work for everyone but this is what I did.  The times my sign showed were 6:50 9:50 3:50 and 8:10.  The sign should have something sticking out of it, it looked something like an eyeball to me, it will be at the end slightly above the time you need to set on the clock, mine was the second time, 9:50.  Now I tried this time with the minute hand on the correct minute and the hour hand on the exact number of the hour, this didn't work.  You have to think how a real clock works, if its 9:50 the hour hand isnt on the 9, its almost to the ten.  So what i did was put the minute hand  on 50, or on the 10 on the clock, then I moved the hour hand from hour to hour, stopping at each one, because at the time I thought it was a glitch so I was trying all times possible.  Once the hour hand was almost to the 10 too the clock popped open.  I hope this helps.  Oh and I love this game, this is the second time I've beat it, the first was on my PC.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love the app. Does exactly what you would expect from a weather app. My only complaint is the lack of landscape display. It is a minor issue but the biggest one holding it back.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a lot of fun and challenging but you will get addicted to it by the end of the first game. so enjoy it best of all its free so if you don't like it just delete it.
B0086700CM|5.0|YEAH!!!  IT FINALLY CAME ON THE KINDLE!  I absolutely love this game no wonder it has a 5 star rating :D I especially love how the monkeys look so weird ^_^
0385504209|3.0|After spending six years in Iraq with numerous Masons from various lodges, albeit mostly Prince Hall and Blue lodge masons(many I consider brothers for other reasons), I can tell you the truth is somewhere in-between both sides of this debate. If one can truly put away their own bias on this subject, they will find enough legitimate evidence to support 'some' of the alleged bad things and good things that occur in many lodges. Note that a much greater number of US Government, Military, and Law Enforcement personnel are Freemasons than you would ever imagine. Think of them as protectors, or gatekeepers.<br /><br />Before I discovered how many of my friends and associates were Masons while working for the DoD in Iraq, my preconceived notion was that they were probably satanists, or followers of the occult. Although, some of the concepts, rituals, etc. might technically be occult, the majority of the Masons I know are not bad, or evil. Most of the masons I lived, worked and risked my life with were of the highest quality character, had the best work ethic, and were the most selfless people, just as our masonic founding fathers.(i.e. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc) However, here goes the sad, but true part..<br /><br />When others resort to blanket stereotypes and ignorant generalizations about Freemasons, they are being sidetracked. The REAL problem is the protective Masonic structure itself imbues masons (both Good and Bad) with the \\"potential\\" to become dangerous threats to humanity. I am NOT speaking of what I 'think' or 'feel', rather what I have witnessed myself in an environment much like the movie, Beyond the Thunderdome (power struggles in a war torn country). I have seen many good masonic people enable, support, and protect a few filthy ones who have done more harm to their brotherhood than anyone on the outside. Some of the most detestable things I saw over there came from power hungry masons who constantly exploited the masonic system in order serve their own interests, or evade the law.<br /><br />I do not believe what I repeatedly saw from the self-serving ones were isolated incidents, but more like a microcosm of what happens elsewhere, including back home.<br /><br />You might think, \\"Well, who the hell cares?\\". That would be the wrong question.<br /><br />Now think about where this might apply in a society full of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse; Corruption. What about the most powerful politicians who keep screwing Americans, but can't ever seem to be voted out of office? Consider the one bad cop on the squad who 'unnecessarily' kills an innocent youth (i.e. trigger happy), but never sees jail time? And how about the CEO of a large bank who somehow manages to convince the Treasury to allow the transfer of toxic debt from their balance sheet onto the backs of the public, sticking it to the average citizen struggling to pay the rent? What about that time a company starts laying employees off, but the new guy who doesn't even know his stuff yet, still keeps his job? Yeah, it is predominately because of 'who they know' and the fact that Masons will not turn on each other, even if they have one sorry excuse for a piece of crap brother whose a murderer. What was once a powerful force for good and freedom early in American history has quite simply been corrupted and exploited.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I very much revere General Patton, Eisenhower, and MacArthur as I borrow quotes from them all the time. Unfortunately, the world is so messed up right now, these wolves I previously spoke about are licking their chops once they get in, as they are fully aware of the level of benefits, protection, and more influential connections they will make. Every time I asked one of the new guys why they were joining, it was always a selfish response. \\"I'd like to have a political career someday.\\" or \\"I need a hookup.\\" (trying to get a better job)<br /><br />While working for Centcom, I can tell you the majority of FreemasonsI knew were a step above the rest of us. But I cannot emphasize enough that some of the most corrupt, filthy, dangerous, thieving scumbags out there also wore the same robe. For much of the criminally inclined savages on earth, they will eventually face the law and justice will be served. But, there's a good chance that same criminal who wears a robe will be placed above the law. Depending on the circumstances and personality of the individual this can empower an ordinary criminal (including a thief) to become a VERY dangerous one.<br /><br />Quite frankly, there doesn't seem to be enough checks and balances, or rather they simply don't work too well since the tight-knit brotherhood can effectively result in a 'no snitch' policy.<br /><br />The adequate response from all Freemasons should be reflective in nature, to determine just how to make this right, restore what has been lost and prevent the great potential for tyranny, injustice, and further inequality.<br /><br />Another reason I had to comment, I really got tired of seeing folks bash some of my friends without even knowing any of them. Trust me, they're not sorcerers. Basically, there's a whole lot of good people doing great work, spending lots of time helping charities and who die regularly for our country, but there's a few rotten apples destroying anything good still left in the system.<br /><br />Just in case you're wondering, because of the aforementioned character issues of a `few' really shady masons, AND because of my personal religious beliefs I will likely never join Freemasonry.<br /><br />I'd also like to consider this a plea for the Masonic leadership take this issue seriously, before it's too late. It may sound crazy, but the balance of power, future of humanity might very well depend on it. Just look around. Freemasons are just as much responsible for shaping the world today as they were way back then during early Colonial days. If the leadership hasn't even started to clean things up yet, it may be a sign it's time for all Freemasons to start shaking things up.I knew were a step above the rest of us.

B0086700CM|5.0|My nephew has been talking about temple run for months so I was very happy to finally see it offered for Kindle Fire!
0385504225|5.0|Lost Symbols was a real page turner, with a lot interesting old world history lost to many modern texts. This is one of Dan Brown's best books in my opinion.
B007SGM084|5.0|The writer takes us through the development of a relationship with expertise.  A lack of insight won't stop you from enjoying the sex, action, adventure, mystery, and yes, the sex.  We are given hints of the darker side of our couple and a great deal to think about.  The writer has done a wonderful job of layering guaranteeing there is something for all in this series of books.  Well done!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Great film, I have never wrote a review for anything EVER! But this was a wonderful film, I enjoyed it and will be reading the books!!
0345803485|5.0|This was a good trilogy  (I read all three) Although it was a bit unrealistic and some words were repetitively annoying, I still enjoyed reading it. It was quite ENTERTAINING!!!  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie and wonder what actor/actress will play Christian and Anastasia.  I'm also wondering how one movie will be made from 3 books.  I have read some positive and negative reviews, so my advice is to read the books for youself to see if you enjoy them.  There are at least 5000 reviews on amazon alone, so while everyone is writing reviews about the author, she is going to the bank as a result of the sales from these books.......Good for you E L James. :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it is the best app ever everyone should get it thank the creators its has no gliches and it wont mess up your device I give I 2 thumbs. up
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome app!  This thing kicks butt!  It's  so fun yet so challenging!  I love it! I beat almost all of the levels!  they are so fun!!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game! ive been waiting so long for this and now i cant atop chanting &quot;run run run as fast as you can, you can catch me cause im the temple runner&quot; :D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For those of you who give this book a bad review, get a life.  Nit Picking how many times certain words are used is just crazy..just get into the book people.  It is an easy read and you won't want to put it down.  Very entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|Good game! Easy to play, good time waster, fun, and just plain addicting! I'd recommend it to anyone, download away.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was curious what all the excitement could be about this book.  I'm sorry I gave in to that impulse because this book was terrible.  It's a sad commentary on the state of our society that this piece of trash received any stars at all.  I give it one simply because I can't give it a zero.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|Finally, this is available as a DVD-R and also instant download on Amazon. This is a well-made production based on a story The Chimneys of Green Knowe. The story is set in 1940s England, where thirteen-year-old Tolly (Alex Etel) is sent by his mother to his grandmother Mrs. Oldknoe's (Dame Maggie Smith) family estate, Green Knowe. His mother remains in London, trying to get information on the fate of Tolly's father who is missing in action.<br /><br />Initially, Tolly resents his granny because he thinks she dislikes his mother, but gradually a close bond forms between the two. Tolly discovers that the estate is in financial trouble and that his granny may be forced to sell it. Tolly also makes another startling discovery - that the estate is haunted by the spirits of a previous generation of Oldknow's, mainly young Susan (Eliza Bennett) who lived in the house more than a century earlier. Susan's father, Captain Oldknow (Hugh Bonneville) is a kind seafaring man who brings home an escaped slave named Jacob and provides for him, expecting only that Jacob be Susan's companion, for Susan is blind. But Maria, the Captain's Dutch wife (played by Carice Van Houten of Black Book) is not keen on the boy and spends her days squandering the Captain's wealth. The couple's only son, Sefton (Douglas Booth) is a spoilt brat who abhors Jacob, and finds ways and means to make Jacob's life miserable.<br /><br />Tolly finds himself not only able to see some of these ghosts but also to be able to travel back in time (it is never explained how this happens) and witness events in the past. This later proves fortuitous as Tolly makes an important discovery that could very well save his granny's estate.<br /><br />The story plays out quite well and is beautifully filmed. I'd characterize this as a family friendly drama - there is no foul language, no sexual scenes, and except for a few scenes where there is some bullying going on, no real violence.
0545123275|4.0|It's not quite the caliber of the Hunger Games or Twilight but I really enjoyed it. I am on book 2 now and plan to complete the trilogy!
B007MAETA8|4.0|This album shows how unique John Mayer is as an artist. He didnt make this album to please the thousands of little girls who want to here another \\"Your Body is A Wonderland,\\" but for his fans that respect his abilities as a guitarist and a writer.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|THE DVD IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION DOES NOT HAVE SCRATCHES VERY WELL PACKAGED AND ARRIVED FAST.  I WATCHED THE MOVIE TWICE BECAUSE I LIKE WHITNEY HOUSTON.  SHE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGER.  KEVIN COSTNER IS AN EXCELLENT ACTOR AS WELL. I AM GLAD I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game a lot. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
B000002KOO|2.0|I love this album.  Of all Fleetwood mac music this was my preferred album.  The CD totally sucks, it's like listening to a scratched album.  It just plain sucks.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very nice indeed. Its addictive (all though I have no idea why) and fun....but it is blotchy any laggy sometimes. I think this game is better on the iPad than the Kindle Fire.<br />If you want some advice....get this game. And once you collect enough coins, buy the character Karma Lee. She runs fast.<br />WARNING to parents....the game is a bit scarey. The evil monkeys creep me out....
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Well, I rented this movie hoping for an action film and - I kind of got that. I didn't really expect an artsy killer wolf movie.<br /><br />I love Liam Neeson (usually) but really felt his acting was wooden and one-dimensional in \\"The Grey.\\"<br /><br />Another problem - I rented this on Amazon as a 24-hour rental and as such, I don't get Closed Captioning. And with Neeson's heavy accent and my poor hearing, I had to keep backing the film up so I could catch what was being said.  That took a lot of the spontaneity out of watching the film.<br /><br />This was a crazy story.  Neeson is the hunter, keeping the wolves away from the oil workers - and kind of \\"wolf whispering\\" them into the next life as they die.  He does the same for the airplane crash survivors as they die during the film (kind of odd for a self-proclaimed atheist).<br /><br />The scenery was beautiful, the wolves were spooky, and the acting was so-so. So unless you just have to see every Neeson movie made, I would skip this one.<br /><br />  Once more into the fray,<br />  Into the last good fight.<br />  Live and die on this day;<br />  Live and die on this day.<br />  - written by Joe Carnahan, director of \\"The Grey\\"
B003K16P3M|5.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br />I have put off reading this book for so long and I don't know why because I really enjoyed it. I am always hesitant when it comes to fantasy  because for me if the world building isn't really good I have a hard time getting into the story. But Kristen Cashore did an amazing job with it and gave us a few characters that I couldn't help but love.<br /><br />Katsa is a graceling, a person who can have a special skill that far exceeds a normal person. Everyone knows who a graceling is because they have two different colored eyes, so no matter what it is very hard to hide who you are. She definitely seems like a feminist, she doesn't want to be married or have children, and doesn't want to rely on anyone for anything. Her Uncle, the king sends her along on missions to intimidate and scare people into doing what the kings wants. She has a reputation for being a dangerous person because of her missions for her Uncle, people are afraid of her, don't want to speak to her, or look her in the eyes. This is what I think made her in the beginning of the story such a feminist, she could fight better than any man she knew and everyone treated her as an  outcast. I loved  Katsa because she was so strong, she had to be being who she was.<br /><br />But, when Prince Po comes into Katsa's life, everything changes and the real adventure to the story begins. Po becomes one of the first real friends she has ever had in her life. He opens her eyes to herself, her grace, and things she never thought she could ever want out of life. He was definitely one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and I am definitely going to continue on with the series. I felt that the story was unique and different.  I felt that Cashore slowed down the plot when was needed and kept adventure and excitement in the parts that you wanted it. I definitely recommend it although, I know some people have said that they thought Katsa was a \\"man hater\\" but, I felt it worked well and made sense for her character.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|Margaret Thatcher was such a huge figure in British politics and for, whatever reason, the filmmakers decided to focus on her latter years and her battle with dementia. AND they didn't even do that well.<br /><br />That is not to say that Meryl Streep doesn't do a fabulous job because she does - as always. Watching her in this film WAS like watching Thatcher herself.  But I was hoping for so much more - an in-depth look at Thatcher's service to her country and the changes she helped bring about. That didn't happen and I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's worth watching \\"Iron Lady\\" just to see Streep's performance but I wouldn't watch it for a history lesson.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is sooo addicting! I absolutely luv this game! It's definitely THE BEST free app for the kindle fire!
B0086700CM|4.0|i love this game but it is kind of frusrating how the shopping page has items that i bought that are total ripoffs... like the wallpapers... but overall... i love this game... no wonder it is currently the top free game!
B0000669JL|5.0|The best! I wore out the first one so I re-purchased it. Wonderful music. I mos def recommend it! Rip Bob.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addicting and fun I would reccomend this game to anyone so it is definatly a 5 out of 5
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book and thought it wrapped up the series perfectly.  I understand some people's disappointment with this book, but unless Suzanne Collins was to write a 1,000 page book, there would be no way to provide closure on every detail.  I felt very satisfied after finishing this book and loved the entire series!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've. been waiting so long for this game to finally come to the kindle fire. but it takes some time to adjust from the ipod touch
0439023521|5.0|I didn't think I would like this series because of the greusome content, but I loved it!  This book was great, but I loved all 3!
B000KQF6X0|5.0|The facts about the Yakuza's are a little off but what do you expect from Holywood?<br />Great cast with M. Douglas, A. Garcia and Japan's great K. Takakura and Y. Matsuda.<br />Yusaku Matsuda who was one of Japan's great actors of the time was tremendous in this movie. This was the last movie he did before his death soon after.

B0086700CM|5.0|great game and my daughter told me about this game and I really love it! ! very challenging but its really great!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|First of all, in my opinion the production that has been such a topic of interest in many reviews is a non issue...The production on this album is fantastic...I totally believe that this is THE BEST SOLO ALBUM THAT JOE WALSH HAS EVER DONE. I have all the James Gang stuff, all the Eagles stuff, and all of Joe's solo stuff...Joe has had plenty of great songs in the past, but this is a very personal, cohesive, and very guitar oriented album...Most of his solo albums have 2 or 3 great songs and then he just kinda goofs around on the rest of the album....He has done great albums in the past, but for my money, this is HIS MOST COMPLETE WORK EVER...THE LYRICS ARE VERY PERSONAL AND JOE ADDS HIS USUAL WIT AND CHARM ON A COUPLE OF SONGS...His wife really got a fish bone stuck in her throat on a trip to Monte Carlo and they had to fly back to the USA to have it removed. The song he wrote about that is a great guitar jammin', witty Joe Walsh at his best!!!! If you like any of Joe's work, this cd is A MUST HAVE!!!! Get the Deluxe edition because the dvd has a live performance of Analog Man, Wrecking Ball, and Lucky That Way. Plus, there is a booklet inside that Joe gives a track by track description of each song and how they came about...Congrats on your sobriety Joe....Keep living life One Day At A Time!!!! ANALOG MAN IS A FANTASTIC PIECE OF ART!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE this game!!!! its fun tuning in the temple and trying to beat your high score I recommend this game for sure. :()
B003O86FMW|3.0|I am not going to reveal any spoilers but I am just going to say that I was very disappointed with the creativity and concept of this book. It lacked it on all levels. I hope you find it differently.
B004T6IBNY|2.0|the game doesn't seem to play like real pinball. the flippers will only flip as hard as you press and the ball seems to roll off the flippers too much. hard to actually aim and control your shots.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I was thrilled to be able to get Magic Puzzles on my Kindle! Now I can work a puzzle at any time and not have to wait for my mother to finish with her ipad!  There are lots of puzzles for free! Sometimes the last piece is hard to pull down but with patience it will come down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not much of a reader but this book is great!  I stayed up until 4 am many nights reading.  I had to make myself put the book down!  I currently just finished the 2nd book!  I don't want them to be over!
0345803485|5.0|The book is an easy read. Is it the deepest, most moving novel I have ever read? Absolutely not. But it did serve it's purpose. It kept me interested, it was an escape into an alternate universe where men and women orgasm together ever single time they have intimate relations, lol. You have to admit, there is something about the novel that keep you turning the pages. At some points it's exhaustively unbelievable and in others it's helplessly romantic and dark. It gives you a smirk on your face that you don't realize until your cheeks start to hurt. E.L. James managed to write a book that has the world in uproar, has women exploring their sexuality and knowing their power. For that alone, it's get's 5 stars from me, just because it starts interesting conversation. I say read it!! lol
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You will love Christian Grey even more with this book!  I stayed up many nights until 3 and 4 am reading these books!  I am in love with these books!  I don't want them to be over!
B0059XTUVI|3.0|One of my former television professors recommended THE IRON LADY to me. She warned me that many viewers did not enjoy the viewpoint the director took. After reading the premise and finding it available in the Vine newsletter, I grabbed it.<br /><br />I agree with the other viewers who commented that Margaret Thatcher's politics were glossed over, almost like the filmmakers were detached from the subject. This was disappointing. Yes, they show how she smashed down gender barriers, which was wonderful. But there are other facets to her story which were not realized.<br /><br />I did like a few things: the cinematography is well done. Meryl Streep gives a performance which others have raved about, and with good reason. She's beautiful and bold; she is not afraid to explore different roles. She portrays Thatcher with quiet grace and strength. Her performance is not enough to lift this film back up though. Recommended for a select audience.<br /><br />Special features include \\"Making The Iron Lady,\\" \\"Recreating The Young Margaret Thatcher,\\" \\"Battle In The House of Commons,\\" \\"Costume Design,\\" and \\"Denis: The Man Behind The Woman.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|lets beat where's my water with the number of reveiws<br />.lets do it<br />we can do it<br />its not impossible
B0086700CM|5.0|Many say there is a lag but I haven't experienced it. this game is really fun and I think everyone should buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game; very interactive; keeps you on your toes and very addictive!!!! I haven't figured out the benefits of the different characters as yet but I race on!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|their are WAY too many adds. the games are highly fun though. and I love that you get all these points just for playing the game.
B007P06DJK|5.0|Responding to the initial reviewer, while I haven't seen the film yet, my understanding is that it's all about the question of whether it's only the music that matters when you're talking about an American artist breaking a cultural boycott to record with African musicians under apartheid. Since that debate was so much a part of the way \\"Graceland\\" was recieved in 1986, the film strikes me as a necessary inclusion - and it's a tribute to Simon's courage and intelligence that instead of doing a sheerly self-congratulatory reissue of an album everybody has already bought many times over, he instead takes the opportunity to re-situate the album in its fraught political and historical context. I agree that the music somehow transcends politics. But the making of the album was a political event as well as a musical event, and it's good to remember that.
B0076I624W|5.0|This movie in Blueray and a 1080p picture are an unbeatable combination if you enjoy looking at the minute details of even the actors skin tone changes in the love scenes. The soundtrack themes could amp up the emotional level of any film it was attached to, but add the fine acting of Claire Forlani, Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, and this Blueray movie delivers the goods. Buy this new blueray version, and who knows, lightning could strike your heart as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My wife asked me to read this first so she wouldn't feel like she was wasting her time. I just finished the third book, and although it isn't my favorite genre, I liked it.<br />Good story, excellent characterizations. Told my wife to definitely read it. A sex story it isn't. A story with some semi kinky sex it is. Good books. I would recommend.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a very fun game I am glide I got this Ice age village.I love the ice age village.
B00005N6KG|5.0|At first when these headphones arrived I thought the earbuds looked weird and I wasn't sure if they were going to scrtach the inside of my ears, BUT they work just fine and the sounds is SOOOO clear and nice! I am very happy, so far these are the best small headphones I have ever owned!. Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is such a fun game and it works great on the Kindle Fire! I need more words. more more more.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. My twin Sister and two brothers also love this game. If you don't have it I highly recommend for you to get it. Its just a game for you to beat you high score, but super fun!
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun game to play. I grew up playing solitaire, so love the convenience of this app.just wish I could play everywhere. sometimes I need wifi to play.
B0064W667Y|2.0|I figured since this was one of the books in the Amazon kindle book store this book would work well with my Kindle Fire.  The problem come when a two page layout is stretched onto one page of my Fire it is unreadable.  This has happened twice so far and I am on # 3 of a 5 part book.  Seems like the fire should be able to rotate with these books or a simple zoom would work.  The pages are already small but I can live with that, the horizontal panels could not be even read with a magnifying glass because the font totally turns to chicken scratch.  Overall the story gets a 4.5 and hate that I miss out on these pages and I will not be ordering the next book unless they can get this issue solve.
B0086700CM|4.0|good game.  I would like to have more info on the game.  otherwise I must learn pieces of the game as I go instead of having all the rules and options up front.
B001E45XT4|1.0|When I bought this it was the most comfortable headset I've ever worn.  However, the materials that make up its casing and wire are complete crap.  Mine broke in no time, and the warranty is just as bad.  I can only recommend this if you are Bill Gates and can buy a new headset every few weeks without thinking about it.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|I think I got about a quarter of the way through it and hoped it would get better.  The story is hard to follow, too detailed about mundane things.  The story line is so slow I just gave up.  I enjoy historical romances and I figured a classic, right?  Should be good.  Nope, it was a waste of my time.
B007HJ91HU|5.0|I grew up watching the original and was a little concerned how this one was going to come out. I was presently surprised and my kids enjoyed it as well.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Good game with a large number of puzzles. One problem I have is that many of the puzzles seem to have multiple solutions.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Yes, the best sci-fi book I have read since Ender's Game. OK I admit I read Ender's Game last week. I really enjoyed this book. It will be a classic.<br />It is certainly the best indie book I have read yet. You will not be dissapointed. It has everything I want in a good sci-fi novel. Buy it. What are you waiting for? You could already be reading it, now go.
B00881VLCE|2.0|first puzzle app I have tried so I have no real basis for comparison ... ....<br />sometimes the last piece gets stuck which is a bit irksome
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I now know what real knife is. I have over 30 knives but this truly the big boy bad ass knife
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Right, so I am a big fan of Marian Keyes' novels. Although it's labelled as chick-lit, these are actually good books. I admit I was rather sceptic the first time I had Watermelon in my hands, because I'm normally not really into these chick literature thingies. But I decided to give it a try, and how glad I am that I did, because I ended up reading most of her books.<br />I admire the way Keyes writes about her subjects - starting with a serious theme at the base (like, in this case, drug abuse), added with some ligher stuff and a twist of humor. It's lighthearted, serious and humorous as the same time - if that is possible.<br /><br />Like many others, the Walsh Family books are my favourite Keyes books. It's just so comforting to get to know the family more and more, each sister with her own life and problem, but always going back to the base - the parents. Which gives cause to laughter and funny situations. And it's all recognisable. I mean, off course we don't all have a family like that, but there's a lot of things that you can identify with.<br /><br />Rachel's Holiday was the 3rd Keyes book I read, and I instantly loved it to bits. I re-read it once in a while and it never manages to get boring. I've read reviews where they said that it's a bit dark - that might be, but not for me. I like this kind of stuff. It gives a fairly good insight of drug addiction and everything that comes and goes with it, without it getting too depressing. A point of view from a girl that could be your neighbour, for instance.<br /><br />That's what I like about it. It's not about some star, some faraway chick who leads a glamourous life and all. It could be anyone. Just the life of some girl that got on the wrong track somewhere, somehow. How it's possible to end up as an addict in the first place. Told by herself - I always like that - and as said before, with lots of humour in it.<br /><br />Anyhow, each to his/her own, but for me this is the kind of book that never gets old. A good read for, well, anywhere and anytime.good read for, well, anywhere and anytime.

0765340798|2.0|I set myself the task of reading the entire Dune ouevre, along with the pasteboard shacks thrown up on the outskirts of Arakeen by the hapless duo of Herbert (the lesser) and Anderson (the least).<br /><br />Having previously tried to wade through Anderson's \\"Saga of Seven Suns\\" heptology, I didn't expect much. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Neither of these guys has any feel for character, dialog, or plain common sense, and anyone with military experience is going to be shaking their head (or laughing out loud) throughout. Much like \\"The Machine Crusade\\" and \\"The Butlerian Jihad,\\" there is no pace, point, interest, focus, or drama to be found here, but rather a plodding recitation of planets slagged, populations euthanized, loyalties betrayed, and the occasional slave genius dissected for no apparent reason by the robot Erasmus, who seems like an escapee from the \\"Saw\\" movies.<br /><br />Another review has characterized this as fan fiction, which it certainly resembles. I'd modify that description by calling it *bad* fan fiction, except that it appears Herbert and Anderson actually get paid for this stuff.<br /><br />Only completists need read this. Borrow a copy rather than paying for it.
B0086700CM|5.0|so awesome that they finally came out with it on kindiel fire. and is very addicting . sweet awesome addicting sick boss.
B006IDG2T6|1.0|I am quite disappointed in \\"Free Will,\\" though I only spent $3.99 on the Kindle version.  Dr. Harris appears to lack the imagination to challenge his assumptions and posit alternative explanations for behavior.  The \\"cause and effect\\" approach to brain function is arrogantly narrow and leads to trivial explanations lacking rigor.  There is no reason to assume that just because electrical impulses (or oxygen uptake, as per his dissertation) in the brain precede action, there is no free will.  Why not a will that is based on experience (after all, I DO learn new things and can then decide how to act on that new information) and is activated on the molecular level by a feedback loop that allows conscious and unconscious input?  Just because we haven't figured out how to measure that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Relativity was not observed until well after it was postulated.<br />The \\"gee whiz\\" example of rape and murder is just flash to sell books, and leads to no new insight.  The brain is supple and subtle- the mystery is not illuminated in this book.  I was hoping for some deep thought here, and all I found was a philosophical rant.  Note to Dr. Harris:  philosophy has been discredited as a way to knowledge.<br />Sam Harris is first author on \\"Functional neuroimaging of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty,\\"  Annals of Neurology,  Volume 63, Issue 2, pages 141-147, February 2008.  He did his work at the UCLA Brain Mapping Center and was undoubtedly the collector of the data reported.  Science works this way:  the graduate student collects the data the principal investigator thinks is interesting.  This article is a mapping report of functional areas in the brain stimulated by the theoretical construct of the questions chosen to illicit the desired response.  The main conclusion stated in the abstract, namely, \\"Belief and disbelief differ from uncertainty in that both provide information that can subsequently inform behavior and emotion,\\" belies the nature of this work.  Uncertainty has an equivalent informational content to belief and disbelief and has the same ability to inform behavior and emotion.  How can a purported neurologist miss that?  Mapping is important to science, but mapping alone does not derive understanding without analysis, further experimentation and critique.  Dr. Harris has published no other scientific articles (according to his website), so we can regard him as a popular figure and not a scientist.  I feel he should kindly leave out the \\"Dr.\\" in his popular work, since it is quite misleading.<br />Finally, the reading list on Dr. Harris' website is impressive indeed.  I feel safe in assuming that he has not read them all.  Also, I notice that Stephen Hawking is notably absent from the company of Penrose, Einstein and Feynman.  What gives?
B0058PJ6NE|4.0|This app has filled my music collection with high quality music, as well as a matching video to boot. I use PowerAmp and it pulls the song from the video because I include that download folder as a place to search for music. So I search for the highest quality version of the song I want, and download that video. As each video is added to the folder, that corresponding song shows up in my play list in PowerAmp. I think the quality is comparable to the same music I was purchasing. Since purchasing this App my music collection has grown ten fold. I love it.

I wish they had done the disc housing differently, maybe more like the Spider Man box set.  I can live with it though.  Very well done overall.  Kudos to Fox for including special editions of all movies and previously unreleased material.
1594135851|4.0|This was a good way to travel but when they said paper back, large print I was hoping they would give me the option of just paper back instead of both paper back and large print. I don't know if that was my own stupidity or if they just weren't clear about it.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is an excellant movie that is very touching and nostalgic. It following these two characters through 25 years against the backdroup of the period.

B007IE4DTU|4.0|I waited with anticipation for the arrival of the George Harrison DVD/CD deluxe box set and have to say it is one of the most beautiful packages in my collection. My only complaint is with the official documentary. Rarely do I enjoy the bonus features more than the main title but in this case it is the extras, hands down. There is very little in the \\"Living In the Material World\\" official film that is revealing or unknown before and the majority of the video material has been previously seen. It is on disc two when the interview subjects get to open up and talk more freely.<br /><br />The music is outstanding throughout and hearing the songs their early form makes the film desirable. As I mentioned earlier, the packaging, disc two and the Early Takes CD make it worth splurging  with your lunch money. I look forward to Early Takes part two.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This is one of the best vampire movies ever and definitely THE best comedy dealing with this topic. The story begins with two very unlikely heroes (the Professor and his servant Albert) arriving to a village in Transylvania, where they hope find the proof of the existence of the vampires, something they both were after for years. And they will find it, no problem!<br /><br />Polanski made here one of his best movies. He however refused just to accumulate gags - rather he made the WHOLE movie in an enormous joke, in which most of the characters are actually trying to be very serious, which only amplifies the irresistible comic effect. Both \\"Vampire killers\\" are extremely committed to their mission - and totally unable to perform it! The vampires are shown not really like monsters but more like a kind of dysfunctional - but still very close - family. In fact the scariest character in the movie is the human servant of the vampires, the disfigured handicapped Kukol, who actually is really serious about his business.<br /><br />Some of the gags are totally irresistible - the Jewish vampire is possibly the greatest delight, but the gay vampire who has a crush on Albert (played by Polanski) is also irresistible. Also, Sharon Tate is incredibly beautiful in this movie, her last, before being murdered... which gives a sad after taste to the whole experience of watching it. The music, written by the great Polish composer, Krzysztof Komeda, himself also tragically deceased soon after, is unique and in itself worth to listen, even separately from the movie. Finally, the landscapes and decorations are stunning - it is the most vampiric decorum I ever saw in a vampire movie.<br /><br />Really, this film is a delight, to see and remember.
B0086700CM|4.0|hours of fun. can be as challenging as you want to make it. we have really enjoyed playing the game and even our two year old is figuring it out a little bit,  he loves watching us play as well.

0984158421|4.0|This was a very interesting book, but I stopped reading it after 3 chapters because I had a hard time reading the end of the line on the even pages (the pages on the left) because it is a paperback.

B004GYNPL2|4.0|This app is great. Easily linked and backed up to dropbox, which is a very nice feature. My only gripe is the fact that I can't back up locally because I don't have an SD card with the Galaxy Nexus. But overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone.

1416594884|4.0|I am not used to read about this kind of novels, I'm more a \\"murder\\" kind of reader so I'm used to have a better closure for the book (identified the killer and is either caught, killed, escaped or commit suicide).  Very good plot, I'm willing to try another one to get a better criteria, but I do expect more elaboration at the end of the book.<br /><br />About the seller, I got the book on time and in great shape, I'd buy there again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|SIMPLY AMAZING and an easy read.  Completely hot and nothing I ever expected for a romance novel... left me panting and wanting my husband a lot more.  And here's why....<br />Just over 7 years ago I was pregnant with my son.  Since then I have been reading about pregnancy, post partum depression, babies, babies illnesses and tantrums, home remodels, new home, cancer, day care, school, work related articles and on and on.  Nothing fun, nothing good... I love to read and I haven't had a GOOD read since I got pregnant in 2005.  I've always loved reading romance, mystery, crime, and anything else catching and I've missed it so much over the years.<br />Two of my friends pushed me to read this and I finally caved and bought all three.  And I am MORE THAN THRILLED to have this as my first read after a 7 1/2 year hold... My \\"inner goddess\\" has emerged again and loving the romance, sex, shocking scenes and new love in this book.  It's carried to my love life (although not as literally).  I've been dormant for so long it was fantastic to have this easy read bring me out again and find some spark in my step and excitement in my read and a flutter in my heart and a naughty thought in my head... It's been amazing.  I finished the book in 5 days... already on the next one... just can't put it down.<br />THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had heard that it was about sex, but I wish I had known the extent of how it explored dominant/submissive sex. It made me very uncomfortable, I didn't get past chapter 3 and am not sure if I'll pick it back up again.  It was glorified porn.

B0086700CM|5.0|I found this game to be really fun on my Kindle. It's one of those games that may not take a lot of thinking power, but it does challenge one's reflexes. There's interesting upgrades and different characters that you can buy. I haven't been able to get any of the back ground upgrades, but I do wish there were different levels and different obstacles.

B000SEIDR0|4.0|I typically do not read nonfiction; to me it's never as enjoyable as a fiction work. However, I have tried recently to broaden my literary taste and so decided to read The Omnivore's Dilemma. I'm glad I made such a choice. This book, for a nonfiction work, is very good. At times, the author deviates from his main point to provide further exposition, but the deviations never seem forced or unnecessary. The Omnivore's Dilemma was both enjoyable and eye-opening, and it ended in a poignant, poetic way. Even if you don't typically read nonfiction (like me) I would suggest this book.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|The \\"but...\\" in my title has nothing to do with Neil Young or the CD itself. This is great music as always delivered by Young and Crazy Horse. It's about the guy who designed the art. Its a beautiful design but I dare anyone read the lyrics or any information in the (cute) booklet without a microscope! What were these guys thinking?!? Did they designed that for a full size LP and forgot this is a CD? Please, get you act together.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|I own the [[ASIN:B003BIFN9G Kata Bumblebee DL-210 Backpack (Black)]].  Great bag, however it has ZERO useful accessory management tools for my camera (which i knew going into the bag).  I purchased a series of small organizers for various accessories i have.  For my filters, this Tamrac case came up in my search and i decided to give it a try.<br /><br />in all i'm happy with this product, however i would like to point out that if you have a smaller sized filter (mine are 72mm, you could find yourself fishing for them and end up causing finger prints on the lens.<br /><br />This case uses a strap on the back that is secured via velcro and a button to utilize outside accessory systems on various bags.  You could also belt loop it if you prefer.<br /><br />because of the design, i feel 100% safe from standard droppings.  (we even threw it into the air and allows it to hit a hard floor and it caused NO damage to the inside items.  (now if you had your lens in one of those plastic cases, most likely that case would have cracked or come apart which would then put you in a race to catch your rolling lens...  However, pressure damage is another thing to consider, under no way would i squeeze this case or hope that if my BAG where to fall, that it lands with stuff ontop, i feel very confident that the filter lens would crack, but the closing flap fits so tight, i doubt you would have broken glass in your bag<br /><br />Unless your bag already comes with a way to secure your individual filter lens or if you really want outside access to them, i see no real reason to purchase this<br /><br />I'm using 2 x 72mm filter lens and in the 3rd pocket, i have my 2 x step down rings.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is not great literature by any means, but it is great mind candy and has an addictive quality (much like the Twilight Series). You will find the main female character frustrating and the male lead unrealistic. It is a fantasy with a warp.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|one of my favorite books ever!  this book is for people who love dystopian type novels.  this book is about a girl named Lena and she lives in a society where they believe love is a disease.  right before her procedure, (spoiler alert!)she falls in love.<br />i think this book was one of the best!  i finished it pretty quickly, and started on the sequel right after.  the only thing about this book i didn't like was that it leaves you with a cliff-hanger.  pandemonium, the sequel, is also like that.  but overall, the book was well written, i felt the emotions lena felt, and i thought lauren oliver was amazing with this book!  i think it's a must read!!!

145210655X|4.0|This book was quite cute for the Star Wars fan who wanted to think of Darth Vader as a kind father before he was turned to the Dark side.  Although, Luke didn't know his father at this early age, the book shows how Darth and Luke MIGHT have related together in ordinary activities.  Purchased for a Father's Day gift.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book! I love how Marian Keyes makes you feel like you are right there with Rachel all throughout the book. Also like how at the begginning of the book Rachel seems like she isn't an addict but once she starts to realise that she is, so do we. My only criticism of this book is that i found it dragged on a bit too long in some parts which let me become a bit bored. Now onto the rest of the Walsh family series!

B007OLYQ4E|5.0|I didn't know it was possible to love reading until I found this book my senior year of high school. My assignment was to do a research paper on one American author, and I chose Capote knowing very little about him. Over the semester, I learned a lot about Capote, but it would be Breakfast at Tiffany's that kept me coming back for more. I chose to focus on this novella and his short stories as well as his personal life for my paper. The book supposedly based off his relationship with a certain Hollywood starlet reminds you that sometimes none of us know where our home is, and we are able to seek solace in the fact that Holly makes it seem not so bad sometimes. Yet, we know that she is a very lonely woman. Breakfast at Tiffany's opened my eyes to a whole new world, and I couldn't ask for anything more from any form of writing.

0345803485|5.0|This book took me by surprise!! I was told by several people to read it, and since I seem to have good luck so far with NY Times Best Sellers I was quick to agree to read it. The surprising part is how detailed and sexual the story is. Before all that however, the author does an amazing job of reeling you in. I was so addicted after the first chapter and was full of so much anxiety (the good kind) that I just had to keep reading. Its been that way chapter after chapter. I find myself in a similar situation as the heroine; confused as to how to view Christian Grey. I go back and forth with distrust, dislike and deep interest in this guy. The author is unbelievably talented in creating the story, characters and twists. I have already recommended this book to All my friends and have added it to my favorite List. I cannot wait to read the next 2 books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to see if the book was better. I wasn't disappointed. The movie did a great job, but the book gives you the inner thoughts of the main character that enriches the experience. The book grips you from the beginning so it makes it hard to let it go.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I may be in love with Richard Attenbourough's voice. His ability to pull you into the many documentaries he's been narrating over the many years is astounding. Pair that with breath-taking footage of this amazing place we call home and you've got a serious hit. The entire series takes you closer to the mystery and stunning imagery of life on earth. I'm grateful to be able to learn more and be seriously entertained. Highly recommended!

B003TTF5VI|5.0|This season opener was intense, having come from the 'cliff-hanger' of George's surgery at the end of last season. It was beautiful to see how each of them mourned George in their own way. I really enjoyed how they tied the character's deep sense of self into the scenes. Not to give anything away about the episode, I feel this was a great introduction to a great season on Grey's. The writing, the acting and the filming is really good this year. Enjoy the drama!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely have a love/hate relationship with this game!!! I love it and can't stop playing but hate it when it doesn't do the action I told it to!!! Very addictive game! Definately worth the download.
1594744769|4.0|When Jacob's fairy tale-spinning grandfather dies in a gruesome attack, Jacob ventures to England to unravel his dying words. Following a trail of hauntingly bizarre \\"trick\\" photography, Jacob finds himself in 1940 and the house of a magical headmistress and her collection of super-powered children, who are under attack by invisible monsters. The plot is nothing original (Harry Potter, X-men, Percy Jackson, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum), and the haunting photography, while clever and beautiful in and of itself, isn't quite used to its full creative potential nor integrated seamlessly into the story. For instance, the crowned girl levitating on the cover is just a little girl who can fly. Her picture is in a box that Jacob inherits, nothing more. Characters stay sadly flat; the plot predictable and unoriginal. Refreshingly, though, the book is written at a high-reading level. Though not with the artistic or emotional or suspenseful skill of Harry Potter or the charming humor of Percy Jackson, the language is well crafted, particularly when it blurs the edges between psychology, history, personal history, and fantasy (particularly concerning the horrors of World War II and the play with time travel). The first book in a series, one can hope that, like Philosopher's Stone, it being so jam packed with exposition, it's potential will be allowed to soar in a sequel. And, man, who can resist those hypnotic pictures? Grade: B+

0765316994|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, even though (or quite possibly because) it went in a direction I totally didn't expect. The first half, wherein Mr. Scalzi does a great job of poking fun at the Redshirt trope from TOS, was frankly hysterical, and was easily my favorite part, but the events post discovery about the Narrative turned out to be a lot of fun as well. I think that my favorite scene involves Duvall ranting over a briefing she had regarding a ship she was previously stationed upon.<br /><br />Of the three codas, the second two were better, with the third bordering on absolutely magnificent and frankly rather touching.<br /><br />I fully intend on reading more from Mr. Scalzi very soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super duper fun and addicting :) i love it!!! i play it every day when i get home from practice
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I read the reviews and expected to like the movie. And I did. It was very cute, if not a bit predictable. I loved the literary/art/cultural references from my 1920s literature and art classes in college. I found myself a little envious of Gil's ability to travel among these people. I suspect this movie would not be nearly so much fun for those that did not recognize the references or characters. All in all, I really enjoyed the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the BEST app ever you really need to get it!!!! The best app In the whole world. get iit
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game its relaxing but when you try to go visit other places it keeps saying I need to update the game and it it updated so I cant visit anyone else. and I don't know how to get any friends!!!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I like this app but it quickly got really difficult. I watched the tutorial, but it is still very difficult for Me. I wish it had some kind of hint option or even a solve option so one could move on if stuck.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is great I got it for myself to try and it became my digital best friend.<br />you should get this game its great
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Wow!!!!!!!!!!  Brian Wilson and company prove their divinity once again.  This is completely consistent with the great works of the past.  It simply doesn't get any better!!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I think that temple run is a very fun game you will be trying to hide. the game under your bed so no one will be taking it from.<br />its free what's better then that<br />its fun you need a little fun in your life<br />you get to buy all this cool stuff. what's beget then buying stuff with the coins you got.
B0086700CM|5.0|That's it. I cannot stop playing this game. It was not available on Windows Phone app market, so Kindle Fire brought me the great joy and (somewhat) healthy addiction this game encompasses.
B0086700CM|1.0|I downloaded it and it wont open :( I wish I could play it I have been waiting for it to come out on the Kindle Fire and it wont open.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. So much, that i finished the 3 books in less than 3 weeks.  Its a great story and goes really quick.  Enjoy it- don't over think it- its a fun book.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played in about well lets see 3years o my God I love it so much I have a high score
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game. I play it all the time. I just wish they would make it a little harder.
B001DHXT20|3.0|No real surprises here: this is a pretty by-the-book superhero movie, with the usual trial against adversity culminating in the obligatory big set-piece battle. Having said that it is done well, and is fun to watch. Edward Norton makes for a sympathetic Bruce Banner, and. although initially seeming like an unlikely choice, Tim Roth is suitably nasty as the marine who enthusiastically undergoes Hulkification in order to attempt destruction of the original. But the story feels a bit thin and there's not enough humour. Although far from a failure it still falls short of a complete success, and the green giant certainly deserves better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great way to kill time. I have never won solitaire with the frequency I do with this version! Would highly recommend.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is a real eye opener. I cannot imagine living under the conditions that exist in North Korea. Great book.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of all the great Bee Gees hits. Even if you weren't a disco fan this music is enjoyable and reflects a fun era in pop music. So sorry to see that we have lost so many of the Gibb family.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I finally let the hype get to me and purchased this book. Seemed like a really cool idea, somewhat like Stephen King's 'The Running Man'. Overall, I enjoyed this book. Yes, there were a few times where I got bored, especially in the beginning, but once it got going, I had fun. The action scenes are somewhat sparse, but man, were they great. I laughed out loud at one part.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book. Aside from a few yawning parts, it's still worth it!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0057GEWHE The House on Mayberry Road]]<br />[[ASIN:B0041T4HIC The Clown Picture]]
0345457692|4.0|This is a well-written hard-boiled (and a bit retro, in style) detective novel, which happens to be set in the year 2400 or so. I really enjoyed the way Morgan immerses us into the culture, with references that we don't get, but at the same time still understand. Great plot. Interesting characters. However, one caveat. I'm no prude, but the use of the \\"c-word\\" was a shock. Every time I ran across it (maybe 10 times, I guess) I was a bit stunned. For those who are offended by explicit sex scenes and that type of vulgarity, skip this.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Fun game mildly challenging. works while with no cell signal or Internet connection which was a nice bonus for me.
0439023513|4.0|I really enjoyed how Katniss ended up with Peeta; however, I believe it was rushed. The author should have went into more depth about what happened after the war and how they made it back to each other. She does explain why she chose Peeta in the end; however, it is not enough. She should have told about how Peeta began to love her again. It just goes from moving back to 12 to eventually holding her then kissing then kids. I did enjoy when he asked her if she loved him real or fake and she said real; this causes me to believe that Katniss is content with her life, as does the scene, when she talks about holding her daughter.<br /><br />The conclusion of the war was also rushed,as was the deaths of Prim and Finnick.There should have been more to their deaths. There should have been more information about the new society that formed post the war.<br /><br />I believe the films will present a better view of Mockingjay than the novel. I believe the screen writers will allow us to see more into Coin's deception as well how Peeta and Katniss find their way back to each other. I just feel like the novel scraps the surface of the ending leaving out all the details that are so pivotal to the conclusion. I am satisfied with ending; however, I believe their should be more supporting evidence. It is as if she got bored with the characters and wrote what should have been several chapters into a few pages.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm addicted to this game.... its fun and funny! plus my kids love it! hhvhh hbgh bhfch hgfch huffy hcdfhh hgffh gfcg g gd giff. gfghb
0307592731|5.0|What I love most about this book is how much you can love the character even though you kind of hate her at the same time. She is not a good person. She is a cheater, a drug user, incredibly unprepared, and terribly selfish. But you want to like her. And ultimately you do. You're able to like her because she knows how terrible she is. She knows she has not been a good person, and she doesn't make excuses. She just tells the truth. The writing is not poetic, and I doubt as many women will fantasize about spending 4 months on the Pacific Crest Trail as did about following Elizabeth Gilbert's journey through Italy, India, and Bali. But the story and the insights are fantastic. There is a raw quality to the emotions that makes this more real than anything else I've read. I look forward to reading it again.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Saw video of this group & wanted CD. Didn't know the background of this group until I did some research. Wow, didn't realize they were Prog supergroup, just enjoyed music! I also ordered \\"Bridge Across Forever\\". Am now enjoying both CD's back-to-back. I even like their \\"covers\\" of groups(Genesis,Procol Harum,etc.) whose original \\"LP's\\", I own. Hope they continue to make more music together...consider me a Transatlantic convert.
1741048303|4.0|This is by far the best guide I encountered and worked for the entirety of my trip, whereas most books focus on Bali. That said, the prices were entirely outdated after only 2 years, and so much has happened in terms of growth in the country, that many of the \\"new\\" hotels in the book were no longer even on the new list once in country.
0670023329|5.0|...what is going on in North Korea is beyond words and description. It's a nation brainwashed and I can't understand how they've been able to keep this up. However, the author does provide one very tantalizing clue in the book, China uses North Korea as a buffer against South Korea [and Japan?].<br /><br />Read it folks and you'll be moved by the story.
0439023521|5.0|All right, then. I'm hooked. I appreciated that the book had far much more internal dialogue than the movie, and that the background of how things came to be was made much more clear. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books soon.
B007P06DJK|3.0|Very disappointed that the film associated with this CD release consists mostly of blather about artistic freedom and very little music.  It's the MUSIC that matters! And we get very, very little of that. I was hoping for a re-release of The African Concert, a milestone in pop music history.  This package is a real letdown.
1439102732|3.0|As always, Jodi Picoult describes a real life situation in a way that makes us all feel the pain of everyone involved. This book deals with gay marriage, gay adoption, music therapy, embryo freezing, alcoholism, and extreme religious right. I'm not quite sure how she got all of that to work together, but it did, and I enjoyed it. It's not my favorite Picoult, not earth-changing, but it was highly entertaining and moving.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the first and second version of this game...didn't think it could be made better.  the graphics and gameplay are so much fun!  I can play for hours.  if you like match 3 games this one will amaze you!!!
B0055SWM08|3.0|I love this game. Full of great puzzles.some easy and some not easy the first few time you try them.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|awesomly addicting couldn't stop playing even fun for the kids who enjoy zombies. wife enjoyed as well as the rest.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love plants vs zombies. The game is awesome, original, entertaining, addicting. I originally had PvZ on the iPhone and PC, so when I got my motorola Atrix 2, I thought I'd add it here.<br />But this app could use some updates. First and foremost it needs to be able to save your game state in the event of an interruption. I tried to complete a level twice in a row, got nearly to the end and had to start all over because I received a phone call. Very frustrating.<br />When compared to the iPhone and PC, the graphic quality in Android is a little lacking. Maybe a higher res option for more powerful phones?<br />I usually am a big fan of popcap, but it saddens me that this game is getting low reviews because of it's inability to update an app so that it can be properly used.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best. so additive keeps me on edge thank you for putting his game on our kindle fire,  I guess Ipad ain't the only tablet device with some cool game once again : THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!
B000063V8T|5.0|We bought this for my father in law for his birthday. As of date he is missing only one season we will get that for fathers day great gift ideas
B007DIQB50|5.0|She did her think on this album! It isn't better then Pink Friday, But it's still a pretty sick album if you ask me.<br />I don't know why people bother to hate... Don't Like her? Do Not Listen. It's That SIMPLE :)<br />PS: Love you Nicki!
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I can't even believe how anyone could give this album a negative review. I remember singing \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" in Kindergarden, and somehow listening to the rocked out version on this album brings me right back there. This album is basically a jam session. No new songs that I know of, and that's just fine with me. The production is top notch, unlike Ragged Glory, which is an amazing album with a terrible sound quality.<br /><br />But these guys really tear it up, in a way that's fun and very rock n' roll. The guitars are robust and up front. Neil's voice is very strong, and you really believe the lyrics when he sings them. It's also a very loose album. You get the distinct impression that they really enjoyed playing with each other. You can almost see them smiling at the end of each song and cracking a beer together. I would love to hear Neil Young and Crazy Horse jam on some of these songs live. I hope a tour is in the works.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this was an awesome app but before i actually got to play it it made me wait for an hour because it was loading ( this is after i downloaded it) and i had got really far and one of the mini games had a glitch and i had to restart my game lost all my progress but it was still a really awesome app
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was amazing! I could not put it down because I loved everything about it! The writing, the pacing, the plot, it was all perfect. I am still reeling from the joy of having finished reading such a great story! It was deeply satisfying from beginning to end, the way great literature is supposed to be.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I must say I'd heard about these books well before I decided to read the first one and I'm so glad that I gave it a try. This was a real page turner. Never wanted to put the book down! Something was always happening so I never got bored with the story, ever! This author is wonderful. I felt like I was right there alongside the main characters throughout. I would highly recommend this trilogy to anyone who loves to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a really fun and addicting game, and the best part is that it's free! Try it, won't regret it!
1594133379|5.0|Easy to read and written mostly in layman's terms, the book provides incredible insight into the workings of the brain and what can be done to recover lost function (and to some degree how to do it). It also explains what functions are lost when different areas of the brain are injured.<br />I ordered and read it simply because I saw an interview with the author and was interested. I have since recommended it to many people who would benefit<br />from it (including professional and lay care givers of brain injury and stroke patients).
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This is just plain great rock and roll.  The band sounds as hot as ever, and Neil is in great voice.  Neil's last album, Le Noise, was a real yawner for me.  This record is lively, intense, well-played and fun to listen to.  Highly recommended.
B007NZDES0|5.0|We saw her concert in Atlanta last year. Couldn't wait to watch the DVD. Sounded great live but on this DVD she started out a little flat at first,but was in top form as the show went on. Of course...she looked great! The perfect example of less is more! Her band was outstanding, the lights and stage production for this DVD was exceptional. If you are a Sade fan,you have to get this DVD! Let's hope it's not another 9-10 years before she records and tours again.
0385534639|4.0|Friends, this is a ticket you do not want to pass up. A competition between two young illusionists is about to begin. Get comfortable, it's quite a magical mystery tour.<br /><br />At center stage is the Le Cirque des Rêves where this challenge between Celia and Marco plays out. No spotlights trained on sad clowns, tawdry sideshows, or underfed felines here. Push back a curtain to find a garden of ice, wishes on trees, a table filled with memories. There are so many tents, so little time before it all disappears to some new unknown destination.<br /><br />I would find some room for argument of a story short on plot, character development, and substantial dialog, but for me all of those shortcomings were so overpowered by what Celia calls \\"the thrill of being surrounded by something wondrous and fantastical...comfort and mystery all tied together.\\"<br /><br />At the end, a central character refers to his writings of the circus as follows: \\"I relay it through printed words on crumpled newsprint, words that can be read again and again, returning to the circus whenever they wish, regardless of time of day or physical location. Transporting them at will.\\"<br /> When put that way, it sounds rather like magic doesn't it?<br /><br />I'd like to see this in every imaginable form. The already optioned movie, of course. But I can see a picture book and a muscial production just as well. Count me among the bewitched.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|When I first thought about watching this movie I thought it was just going to be another movie like ones in the past where it really has no plot, and acts as more of a documentary. But NO, when I saw this not only does it show its fair share of action but it has a great plot with a perfect ending and quote. This is a very powerful, moving movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is extremely addictive. I have been playing it continuously everyday since I downloaded it. I highly recommend it to everyone
031606792X|5.0|I have been a bit scheptical about this series but after I started reading Twilight I realized that these were good books. BREAKING DAWN is very good. Is interesting to see how Stephenie Meyer broke the story in two sections or parts, Bellas and Jake's (Jacob).
B0086700CM|5.0|The game is fun, when you start playing it, you'll never get away from it! Its so fun and addicting!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great and the cats are so cute..... I wanna have them... I also like doing puzzles so I really enjoy these kind of activities.....
0345803485|1.0|As with other negative reviewers, I thought the writing was juvenile, repetitive, and a bit \\"plagiaristic\\".  I found at least four scenes or dialogs that seemed eerily similar to Pretty Woman.  The storyline and characters were so unbelievable that  ended up deleting the entire trilogy from my reader.  $30 wasted, but I'd rather read truly good stories than suffer through this nonsense.
B0086700CM|5.0|its fun to guide your person throughthe corsse and. to jump duck and turn your way through the way. also its very popular and about all my friends play it! and its neat to go to the game store and upgrade stuff for your person.
B007JRTSVE|4.0|This movie is very enjoyable for the entire family, and it moves fast.  My four-year-old absolutely loved the music and the dancing scenes.  One of the few movies that he has watched entirely.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I know little of these actors.  I do know that I was so emotionally broken at it's ending that I had to put down in my simple fashion how I felt.  I don't need to re-hash scenes.  I became involved in their lives so quickly and torn apart at their ending situation. At times I was reminded of \\"the Man who fell to Earth\\" but that might not be correct since the last time I saw that film was it's opening Westwood, CA years ago.<br />I will live with this film for a short time until like everything else we forget it and it drifts away from out of my train of though.  For now, it's mine. but yet always be reminded of my emotion that I allowed my to become part of the script<br />Watch the film, it has it difficult scenes but just live with them and you will understand, I hope.  If you don't I feel that we are completely different  personalities,.  That's okay . I have a tendency to lose myself in certain films and this being one, I am left very sad.<br />Rhoda's secret is not without motive and one we have heard before
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is great. good graphics, lots of land, anything u want. I absolutely love it. u should download it
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! ! immediate addiction have to play keep away from my kids because the love it too!!  i play it every chance  i get
B00884GR0W|4.0|I bought the game and it says that I need to buy the full version to save the worlds plz fix
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very addictive game. The only problem I had with this game was I  had to turn my sensitivity all the way up because my turns weren't registering. So with my high sensitivity, I have to wait till the last second to turn. All in all, this game is great.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so good I can't describe it!!! Every one who has a kindle fire should get it paid or not.
0316066524|2.0|This novel is hypnotic, like the addictive worlds which most of its characters inhabit. Those at the tennis school are addicted to success; those in the halfway house are addicts of a different sort. Infinite Jest consumed a week of evenings, then came to a depressing, but hardly surprising conclusion. The author is quite talented; he created a memorable character in Gately, the halfway house manager. I stuck with this mainly to see what would happen to him at the end.
0345803485|2.0|I admit it - I bought into the hype. Two respectable girl friends of mine recommended this book. We're adults. We have careers. We take pride in ourselves being strong women (blah blah blah). So when they went on and on about how great this book was, what could I do? I always read Amazon book reviews. I think they're always honest and to the point. I've bought many of books via Amazon but this was the ONLY book that I've ever wanted to write a review on b/c the book was THAT bad.<br /><br />I fell asleep the first 100 pages. The writing was ridiculous. It really seemed the author would google thesaurus at least 1-2 words per page and insert what google would consider to be a Harvard standard version of that synonym. I was cringing b/c you can't make a 3rd grade type of writing book appear Pulitzer by inserting 'more difficult' words to understand.<br /><br />I perhaps enjoyed the somewhat 'romantic' side of the characters relationship. The physical side, in my opinion, was lame (just my .02c people).<br /><br />If I had to read 'and she bit her lower lip' or 'her cheeks turned crimson red'...I would have punched myself in the face.<br /><br />My cousin told me this book was written by a fan of the Twilight series. I slapped my forehead w/ a big ol' duhhhh. It all started to make sense. B/c this book was an adult version of Twilight (the horrible writing, the lip biting, the handsome dude, over exaggerating scenarios, etc etc). I tried to read the Twilight series but gave up each time b/c it just wasn't my thing.<br /><br />The ending was ridiculous. The last few chapters had me hoping that something 'epic' would happen - but yeah - no - not for me at least.<br /><br />I might be in the minority , who knows , but I know a lot of ppl that love this book. Not like. But LOVE. So if you have nothing better to do and there's NO other books in your pipeline to read, then MAYBE get this book. Otherwise, I'd skip it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie is amazing and worth being in any collection. The video and audio quality is fantastic and the movie itself is in my opinion the MOST Underrated movie of ALL time! Disney could've done 2 things to give it more success; They should have made the name more compelling, and they should have released it for the Summer. There is no reason this movie does not deserve a sequel if they just marketed it better. I highly recommend this movie to Disney fans, fantasy fans, and Science Fiction fans.<br /><br />Avatar + Prince of Persia + Star Wars = John Carter!
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|The first book was barely readable. And the second was worse. I could not finish it because it was so bad. I highly recommend staying away from this book unless you are a girl between the ages of 13-18 or you have absolutely nothing else to read.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|It's like the PG13 version of, 'American Psycho'. The USA Network continues to bring very popular shows that I call, \\"TV-lite\\". They must have a young, energetic and mischievous Board of Directors (at least the decision-makers) at that Network coming up with great shows challenging the product of the geezers at the ABC, NBC, and CBS bone-yard. It's like the fraternity brothers have outdone the alumni. Creatively, it is very difficult to tell ahead of time what type of a TV Show will hit you just right, speaking from a viewer's point of view and what to produce, speaking from a Network's point of view. All viewers go through different phases or stages throughout their lives where each of the various genres is more compelling. I have no idea why this particular show is so appealing right now. The descriptions and other comments posted do sum up very well most experienced reviewers' opinions concerning why it is a hit.  Anyway, this does appear to have a unique approach that is able to catch whatever it is that makes it more popular than anyone could have predicted. Well thought out, well known strategies are used as its basic set up. It is a fact that foils within any story, where right on target, when perfectly matched against each other, often creates sums greater than those of their parts. Dirty Harry, for example, Clint Eastwood's first in that series was elevated beyond average simply because there was an amazing bad guy offsetting Harry's character, allowing him to be tough and mocking as he was. In SUITS, Louis Litt is the guy to which Harvey Specter says, \\"Do you feel lucky, PUNK?\\" Harvey's last name is not an accident, BTW. Though Meghan Markle is miscast, she may grow on me. As it is, there is an uncomfortability surrounding her interactions. (Note added after three Episodes of Season Two: Markle's character, and the way she plays her, has dramatically improved so far this Season. Rachel is galactically more watchable.) Sarah Rafferty, Harvey's legal secretary, is one of the most attractive women on TV in a long time. The relationship story line between Harvey and his receptionist is exceptionally well written and played by each actor. These Leads, along with the rest of the cast, allow unlikelihoods to play as if possible, being a fine-line trick that all shows try to come up with.  Here the writers have found a way to let us believe that these relationships could actually be real and so, the existence of this group being accepted, they go from there. Harvey and Louis are actually equally egotistical, Harvey almost always getting it right while Louis rarely does. Louis' ickiness allows Harvey to be as big and bad as he wants yet still not objectionable to the viewers. Viewers do not like bullies but bullying back is waited for with great anticipation. The one-upmanship shenanigans that go on are hilarious. What Louis' character does is absolutely essential to at least half of what Harvey can be and do. Along with all these positives it is also very smart the way this show, as many others do/have done, grabs a broader audience simply by referencing the culturally equalizing points made by historically famous movies, quotes and characters from those movies as well as the show includes cross-generational sayings and their culturally diverse implications within its dialog effectively linking each and any generation to the show. What an unexpectedly refreshing pleasure of novelty this show brings, right? \\"There can only be one\\".-Harvey. \\"We're at a funeral and you're quoting `Highlander'?\\"-Jessica.ry, is one of the most attractive women on TV in a long time.

B003R0MF1W|5.0|Besides being supremely funny and entertaining to watch unsuspecting characters at a crime scene when they chase Patrick around after he cattle prods out of them information he needs to catalog and rank his deductions, being great fun to watch, it is also a good way for us to study people. This is an informative and educational tool in your attempt to read others. Jane has studied the clues and cues which are available to all of us if we knew about them.  If he is trying to get further info all he has to do is sound insulting or accusational, out of line and/or embarrassingly to  any potential suspect, then we watch as he watches their reactions, often having to run off as he is chased by an irate unsub. If needing to know more he prods them silly, until they see red, until he has a read, a piece to the puzzle, being able to set that piece in its appropriate place as he aids the law by being a great crime detective's adjunct professor. Especially nice is the way Baker's character eventually gets around to explaining to all the others why he concludes this or that about an unsub because of this or that reaction, smell, personality type having been found out, faults and strengths of each having been assessed, ruling in or out this or that, being able to prioritize the info as it comes in also going through his processor, it being an IQ-thing that finalizes the computations. From the Pilot into the show a few episodes all he appears to be is a jerk to the average viewer. We eventually learn there is a method to the madness he induces in others. Sounding, off the bat, before further explanations for his prickliness, it appears to be like the multiple misfirings of an intentional irritant, therefore as if being personal assaults, while in reality the reasoning behind why he does and says what he says is anything but personal.

B007QRWXJG|2.0|Can't believe they've left so many interesting plots from previous seasons of MAD MEN undeveloped. How did Duck Philips lose out after SC was acquired by the Brits? How did the \\"Quitting Tobacco\\" letter written by Draper help or not help the Agency? Old man Cooper packed up and left after the \\"Letter\\" fiasco and just returned without any explanation of how? They had this interesting way of going back in time to explain stuff. Why have they stopped doing that? Is that the end of Dr Miller? Is that the end of Carla who seemed to know so much about the Draper household? How about Peggy's struggles with her faith? Pete's feelings for her and the child together. The list goes on. They need to concentrate more on the emotional relationships between all these characters and Don's mesmerizing talent as an Ad Man to keep viewers' interest. The first three episodes of season 5 have been way below par. The show is loosing it's appeal.

0345803485|1.0|I, too, was caught up in the hype. This is not my normal genre to read and/or write. At page 112, I had to stop and read the last ten pages.......I then threw the book, yes, the book, in the trash - a sin among us voracious readers. The author's style had a diary like flair, but I felt as if I was reading the excerpts of a teenager who was trying to be a college student. Found myself glancing through text that was not making the story have any value. I wanted more character development about her and Christian Grey----Wasn't hooked as they say. At the end of every chapter I kept eyeing the amount of book to go and finally as said, gave up. I do not like to write a negative review, but offer constructive criticism. There have been many books I haven't \\"liked\\", but at least I could find many positive elements about plot and characters to follow to the bitter end. I couldn't do that in this book. If anyone is interested in reading this, borrow it from a friend. As I finished the final sentence, my first thought was---this is a \\"trilogy\\"????? I do wish the author continued monetary success........I won't be buying.

B003EYVXXW|4.0|Agora is a sweeping epic covering the fall of Alexandria and all it represents: religious freedom, women's rights, and critical thinking. At two hours long, it's an intriguing take on a pivotal moment in history that says as much about our modern society as it does about the past.<br /><br />The film starts out with a God's-eye view of the world, slowly zooming in until we see it's 391 AD.  Greek Philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz, revealing her full acting range here) teaches the future leaders of Rome at the Platonic school of Alexandria. Her father is the tolerant Theon (Michael Lonsdale) and director of the Musaeum of Alexandria. A love triangle of sorts swirls around Hypatia: Theon's slave Davus (Max Minghella) whom she could never love due to his social status and one of her pupils Orestes (Oscar Isaac) whom she doesn't love because of his inevitable dominance as her husband. This delicate balance of learning and freedom is not to last.<br /><br />Christianity is on the rise in Rome and the Library of the Serapeum becomes a symbolic representation of all things pagan. When a conflict over the worship of the gods turns violent, a full-blown riot causes the pagans to retreat to the Library.  The Christian Emperor eventually settles the conflict by allowing the pagans to escape with their lives, leaving the library to the Christians. End of Act One.<br /><br />Act Two picks up years later.  Many of Hypatia's students have gone on to become leaders of Rome. Orestes, still in love with her, is a prefect of Alexandria. Synesius (Rupert Evans), another former pupil, is now the Bishop of Cyrene. Davus has been freed and joined the Christians extremists. Hypatia has been toiling diligently away at developing a heliocentric model of the solar system and elliptical orbits of the planets. But the Christian leader Cyril (Sami Samir) is not content with just expelling the pagans.  The Jews are at risk too, and it's not long before a similar conflict erupts in the streets.<br /><br />It's clear the Christians are ascending in power, leaving civil authorities at risk of losing their secular objectivity.  Cyril uses Orestes' affection for Hypatia to attack his authority.  If Hypatia will not convert, the Christian mobs will kill her; if she does convert to Christianity, Cyril's authority over the city is complete. Orestes refuses to force the issue publicly but pleads with her in private to convert.  For those viewers who know their history, Hypatia is already doomed.  It is just a question of who will stand by her in the end.<br /><br />Agora occasionally reaches to connect with a modern audience beyond what history has told us - director Alejandro Amenabar heaps scientific theories in her lap so that we can understand just how much was lost. The inverted roles of fanatical extremism and the literal interpretation of scriptures is likely to be a sore point with some, but Agora makes a compelling case: Hypatia WAS killed by a Christian mob for being a witch.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film drags as it slowly unspools an inevitable downward spiral of learning, freedom, and human decency. As a history lesson it's thought-provoking and more than a little controversial.  As a film, it's about twenty minutes too long./><br />It's clear the Christians are ascending in power, leaving civil authorities at risk of losing their secular objectivity.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|This movie was fun to watch, especially the pretty realistic looking flight scenes. I sympathized with the teenage angst and the repeated tragedies. Sure I'm 47 but I still bear the scars that those few short years left on my emotional landscape. These days 3 years go by pretty quick but 3 years in high school took forever! This movie is arguably targeted toward teenagers but I went anyway. I generally do my best to forget I was ever a teenager and I avoid such movies but if you throw in some telekinesis, I'll go. I just ordered the DVD since I want to see it again without destroying my immortal soul by getting it, shall we say, some other way. I also hope to see some deleted scenes and maybe some commentary from the producers. I crossed my fingers and placed the order.<br /><br />Ok. Got the DVD. It has some features like a rough CGI outline of some flight scenes and the major battle. It has a couple rehearsals of some of a few scenes with different actors. It doesn't have any commentary from the director though. I'll leave my review at 4 stars. If it had a commentary I'd give it 5.
0765316994|5.0|While I'm not a fan of the Star Trek universe, I've seen various episodes & movies over the years, and as a sci-fi fan I'm quite familiar with the term \\"redshirt\\".<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading, but I was willing to give it a try.  I thought maybe it would be a silly take on the inane things the redshirts do to end up perpetually dead.  Or maybe it would be full of incomprehensible (to me) Star Trek lingo and inside jokes, and I'd totally hate it.<br /><br />Nope.  Instead, it's a smart, funny tale of a universe gone awry.  Where the characters KNOW something's up, and they're smart enough to work towards a solution.  Scalzi treats the \\"redshirt\\" problem logically - of COURSE the characters are smart problem-solvers, they work as science & technology workers on the most influential spaceship in their universe!  So then WHY do they keep dying in mysterious, illogical, ridiculous ways?<br /><br />I disagree with other reviewers who say the characters lack depth.  I think those reviewers may have missed something, and should consider a re-read or a quick discussion with another reader on the details.  I'm not blaming them for missing something - it's a very fast read, and it's easy to miss things when you're rapidly devouring an excellent tale such as this.<br /><br />I will admit, it is a short book - Amazon shows the hardcover at only 320 pages, and I believe the Redshirts \\"novel\\" portion on my Kindle version ended at about the 75% mark.  The three \\"codas\\" took up the remaining 25%, providing three additional characters' POVs on events.  I loved the different writing style Scalzi used in each section, and I liked how it all ties together at the end.  The first and third codas were my favorites, although that may also be due to the styles used, not just the stories told.<br /><br />All in all, I laughed out loud several times, exclaimed loudly between two chapters towards the end (getting a very strange look from my husband), and got something in my eye at another point (no spoilers).  I have already recommended this to all my friends and family, and I think you should read it, as well.omething in my eye at another point (no spoilers).

B0039V8NJC|5.0|What a clever and powerful book.<br /><br />Beautifully written in First Person Narrative by only one character throughout the book. In my opinion, it would not have been quite such a powerful book written any other way.<br /><br />The voice of Changez seemed very real and showed his Pakistani/English accent very well.<br /><br />I am not normally a fan of books that leave the ending open to your own interpretation but this is the one exception. I would have been disappointed if the ending had been more resolved. The book group discussion of the ending showed me even more how clever the writer is as each person in the group had a slightly different view of how the story went.<br /><br />Despite being a short book, by using certain widely held stereotypes, the author managed to make the characters very easy to visualise and even to understand (whether you agree with them or not you can understand where they are coming from on both sides of the story). It certainly gave me some food for thought and some understanding of the world situation at that time.<br /><br />Read it for the second time for Book Group and it just gets better as I notice even more detail that I did not pick up on during my first read many years ago.<br /><br />Definitely one that has made my \\"everyone should read this book\\" list.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|SAFE HOUSE is a movie looking for a story. It is a film that is packed with fine actors who've proved their chops many times, but here writer David Guggenheim has simply failed to give them a plausible, sensible story and all that is left after movie's end is confusion and a lot of smoke, fire, and debris and scratching of the head. Daniel Espinosa directs obtusely.<br /><br />Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a bored but in love CIA rookie whose tedious assignment it is to man a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa: he longs for a European assignment but his position on the CIA totem pole is far too low for anything other than where he is, according to his boss Dave Barlow (Brendan Gleason). Things change rather abruptly when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) the CIA's most wanted rogue agent is captured and taken to the safe house. The CIA suddenly sees Matt's position as key and his bosses (Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard et al) see that they finally have caught the dangerous rouge CIA Tobin Frost. In interrogation ensues but during Frost's interrogation, the safe house is overtaken by mercenaries who want Frost. Weston and Frost escape and must stay out of the gunmen's sight until they can get to another safe house. From there on it is chase scenes segueing into chase scenes and very little makes sense to the point that few in the audience will care what happens.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are always a delight to watch and even with this little bit of a mess of a movie they still make it watchable. The rest of the big name actors - Farmiga, Gleason, Shepard, Rub&eacute;n Blades, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham and Nora Arnezeder - are barely given enough lines to exist. But if you like action flicks, this one will likely please. Just keep expectations low. Grady Harp, June 12

B005LAIGN2|3.0|This movie has a list of great actors in it so when I saw the previews I couldn't wait to see it because I just knew that it was going to be good.  The acting was not that good and maybe it was the direction they received I don't know but I expected better from this group of actors. The subject line was great and inspiring but the acting did not do it jutice. it's one of those movies that I don't think that I'll watch again. If you have the option to rent I would definetly do that as oppose to purchasing this movie.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Basically.. read this book if you have the time and the patience.  It took me about a month to read book one.  Most of it didnt grab me, but there were some parts that kept me interested.  This couples sx life is a bit much for me, and i am not a reserved person to say the least.  Its just a bit over the top.  I appreciate the \\"romance\\" in the book, but thats about it.  Im sure you've already heard that this book is poorly written.. thats an understatement.  This book is difficult to read because you have to have patience with the writer and the characters.. but you cant help wanting to know what happens with these characters.  I havnt decided if i will read the next one..

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Love this game. It's like pictionary. I wish there were more words though. Some words are pretty hard to draw.
0451205766|4.0|A friend recently loaned me her copy of this book. I've seen the movies, love them all, and, not surprisingly, enjoyed the book. As is often the case, a movie just can't compete with the level of detail and nuance that a full novel can provide.<br /><br />In this case, I couldn't help but connect my memories of the movies with the particulars of the novel. The faces, the accents, the atmosphere. The mythology of \\"The Godfather\\", for me, is completely tied to the movie and so my expectations were just a little off-kilter when reading the book.<br /><br />The story, in large part due to its familiarity, reads very quickly. The plot points are thick, though the conclusions rather abrupt - as abrupt as a bullet shot through a revolver. Puzo blends plot conclusions which their preceding detail, in a very stylistic way - Sonny's bullet-ridden body is brought to the funeral before we find out how he was hit during an ambush at a toll booth. The final scenes read very similar to Francis Ford Coppola's signature chop-cut conclusions to his \\"Godfather\\" films, and one gets some insight into the vision behind the visuals.<br /><br />This is a terrifically iconic work and I highly recommend the read to any fan of the films. This will only build on the mythology and intensity and depth of the individual characters.
0671449028|5.0|I was surprised at the small size of this book.<br />It's hard to tell from the pictures that it's a small book.<br />That might be a good thing since it's good for little kid hands.<br />The pictures are cute too.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The album is a major success, a dynamically coherent narrative that might defy a one-time listen.  Please do not be daunted by the predictable reviews that hear words like \\"beach\\" and \\"car\\" and are incapable of  disassociating them from rank nostalgia.  The concept of nostalgia, rather, plays a narrative role in the larger philosophical progression in this album. Critics may want to disassociate the \\"fun in the sun\\" elements from melancholy of the final tracks: they cannot exist independent of one another, just as Brian and Mike cannot. If you want to distinguish between enforced nostalgia and the BB simultaneous engagement with exuberance and sadness, listen to the execrable \\"Beach Baby\\" song from the 70's by the forgettable \\"First Class.\\"<br /><br />Put another way, we can't go \\"from there to back again\\" without Beaches in Mind and Daybreak and without all of Mike's urgent longing for a lost past. Thus what some are calling moments of cheese, in the published journalistic reviews in music magazines and websites, is only the necessary element of innocence that makes the experience sublime, to put it into Blakian terms. Little lamb, who made thee? sounds like cheese too, but it exists in dynamic juxtaposition to the Tiger and the Chimney Sweep.  The songs on the album thus get more mature in theme and lyric and musicality; we are experiencing the \\"ages of man,\\" a classical and medieval trope, through the BB's vision of themselves. The album tells us \\"we're back to together\\" and \\"the past is all behind us.\\" Then it asks a question: \\"isn't it time?\\" and it answers it, somewhat tragically with the final sequence of songs: \\"sunlight's fading and there's not much left to say\\" ; \\"I'm better off alone; \\"old friends have gone; they have gone their separate ways\\"; \\"our dreams hold on for those who still have more to say.\\"<br /><br />In short, old age means nothing without youth. Are the BBs Cicero, as in his de senectute?  Well, pretty close. They are our modern philosophersabout youth, age, and wisdom. The NYT review is the best I have seen on this topic, so please be guided by its wise insights.<br /><br />Listen, furthermore, to who sings what throughout the album, as each part manifests the character and history of the singer. example: the ever-boyish, hopeful Bruce sings as \\"long as we all stay together.\\" Jeff, originally an outsider but a loving friend, sings \\"I'll give you shelter from the storm,\\" which can be read symbolically as his care for Brian and the BB. Mike's assertion of summer fun continues to make him allegorical of that season and emotion, while Brian responds with \\"being alone\\" and \\"summer's gone.\\"  Al is the thoughtful, faithful imp, the pure and pious heart of caring virtue--a perfect voice for \\"From there to Back Again.\\" The BB have put the songs and the men in dialogue with one another dynamically; that's why the album works as a whole, generating complex beauty and meaning that demand and provoke constant listening and contemplation.<br /><br />Update after having taken the record to hear at the beach: Listening to the end of \\"Summer's Gone,\\" with the recorded surf merging with the real sound of the sea in the Pacific, obtained, I can assert, the proper effect (I don't think I am original in this observation):  the BB gave voice to the landscape, but they finally fade and surrender their voices to the endless, lonely sea.  If that sounds romantic or even bathetic, try listening to Summer's Gone as described, and your head will fall, heavy with tears into your open hands.<br /><br />My current hopes?  That they hit the top 5 on the charts Wednesday June 13th) and that they immediately announce a new album contract as a follow up. But if this is it, we will all have an eternal moment to comfort us in our mortality.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This was a fascinating read. The behind the scenes machinations and relationships of current and former presidents is a compelling tale. It breaks each man out of their boiler plate image and paints a broader portrait of the indvidual.<br /><br />The realtationships between common party members and their counterparts are not neccesarily would you would expect. Carter the self aggrandizing, rascal teeing off Clinton only to be called back into service by him on more than one ocassion, and then forming a surprisngly close bond w/ Gerald Ford on a 6 hour plane ride to Saddat's funeral after a more han 5-year bitter rivaly. Reagan teaching Clinton how to salute properly. Clinton's surprising rapport w/ Nixon and the latters geniune appreciation of the former seeking his advice. And much more.<br /><br />I only wish there were more \\"club members\\" and stories to go along w/ them. Because I didn't want this interesting, historical and educational narrative to end.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I was skeptical about this, but after watching the first episode I was completely hooked. I think I finished the whole season in about a week and anxiously anticipated the next season. The character development was flawless, the sets were spectacular, and the plotline was on-point. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it and the twists and turns in the plot made it a great watch. Watch it and you will be mystified.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I was surprised (and relieved) to spend 39 minutes with an album that is, at this point in time, a fitting addition (and maybe the final chapter, who knows) to the legacy of the \\"real\\" Beach Boys.<br /><br />In June 1985, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, Brian Wilson, and Carl Wilson (Dennis had died in December 1983) released what could arguably be considered the final \\"Beach Boys\\" album, [[ASIN:B000008DAF Beach Boys]]. It was produced by Steve \\"Culture Club\\" Levine, and had a cold, brittle, impersonal feel. It had a long list of guest musicians, including the late guitar legend Gary Moore, Stevie Wonder, Ringo Starr...but it still felt cold. A video for \\"Getcha Back\\" received some heavy play on MTV, but it was clear that the \\"Brian Is Back\\" era was drawing to a close.<br /><br />The album \\"Still Cruisin'\\" came in 1989 and yielded the hit \\"Kokomo,\\" which some Beach Boys fans like and others don't. Brian tossed in one song for the album, but was otherwise involved, and the track listing was padded out with \\"I Get Around,\\" \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" and \\"California Girls.\\"<br /><br />In 1992, the album \\"Summer In Paradise\\" was released.It sold 10,000 copies. The cadinal sin on this album was a John Stamos re-recording of the Dennis Wilson classic \\"Forever\\" from the album \\"Sunflower.\\" WHY, guys...WHY? It also featured a weak-kneed, wretched, pointless cover of Sly Stone's \\"Hot Fun In The Summertime.\\" Carl, Mike, Al and Bruce were smothered in a sea of FOURTEEN additional musicians, including Terry Melcher and Roger McGuinn.<br /><br />From that point forward, Carl passed away in February 1998...pretty much taking the heart of the band with him. Brian had the songs, Carl provided the heart, the true mojo of the band at its best. Brian made steady gains with his solo career, especially with 1998's [[ASIN:B000007NCL Imagination]], an album every bit as good as any \\"classic\\" Beach Boys album. Mike Love and Bruce Johnston went in one direction with a lineup of touring musicians under the \\"Beach Boys\\" brand, as did Al Jardine, resulting in lawsuits and acrimony spread across the years that followed.<br /><br />So here we are in 2012, a Beach Boys reunion with one out of three Wilson brothers and the return of an original member, David Marks, who left well before the band got \\"deep.\\"<br /><br />Producer Joe Thomas takes a co-writing credit on all of the songs but one, \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean,\\" and it's the only song to carry a sole writing credit from Mike Love. Brian had a hand in writing all of the remaining tracks. The final track, \\"Summer's Gone,\\" includes a songwriting contribution from Jon Bon Jovi.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, it was a wise decision to tilt the balance of this album toward Brian and not handing the keys to the car to Mike Love. While there are some \\"up\\" tunes on the album, the overall feel is bittersweet...a sun-kissed beach approaching twilight. You can see the scars and feel the age, but it is unquestionably \\"The Beach Boys.\\" The album is somewhat like \\"Pet Sounds\\" without making such a major statement about alienation, love, and finding a place in the world (or not). At this point, the band has nothing to prove. This project was about getting together to \\"be the Beach Boys\\" one more time, and given the obstacles described above, they did an admirable job. I can't imagine a Beach Boys fan being disappointed on any level other than uncontrollable circumstances (the loss of Carl and Dennis).<br /><br />Are we looking at the \\"Surf's Up\\" album cover come to life...the last ride? Who knows. The critical reception to this album has been strong and the reunited band has been welcomed with open arms. As long as they have their voices and as long as Brian maintains a skill and passion for the craft of songwriting, this doesn't have to be the end. But if it is, I can assure you that it's the end many Beach Boys fans thought they would never see...warm, elegant, an affirmation that despite a number of career-spanning missteps, The Beach Boys were...and are...the stuff of legend. Just buy it.-spanning missteps, The Beach Boys were...and are...the stuff of legend. Just buy it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was not a good read. Weird. Don't read book. Waste of time and money. Time magazine was so far out to lunch with their comments on EL James
B0079XNWQA|5.0|No...as stated in other reviews it's not like the previous release. It's really this simple....buy it and listen to LOVE 3-4 times. If you aren't hooked on every song by then, then something is wrong with you and you have no idea what great songwriting is. I like all of Jasons other previous releases, and this is different, yes, however I believe all of the songs on Love are superbly crafted. After the first listen I felt that it was just ok, but after the third or fourth time through I was blown away at just how good it really is. Get it.

I love that it's set up as a diary, as well. Although, I will say that I often skipped the date headings ... so sometimes I didn't know what month I was in. I read some review on Goodreads that mentioned that it just didn't seem realistic that she could keep a minute-by-minute diary as everything happened. I don't think that's what she did. I tend to think that Bridget wrote down everything toward the end of the evening. She could count her drinks/cigarettes/lottery tickets better that way.<br /><br />What surprised me about Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding is that there are quite a few feminist themes in it. Bridget's friend Sharon talks quite a bit about the games men play tells the lot of them that they're better off without men who use women to play games.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like about the story is the Bridget's mom/Julio fraud story line. I guess people get duped every day, but I'd like to think her mom was smarter than that. Still, it makes for a zany story.<br /><br />Bridget may seem like a caricature because she has so many flaws, vices, and mishaps, but really Fielding is making her relate-able to almost every woman. We've obsessed about weight, men, smoking, our appearances, etc. for so long. Bridget embodies all of our insecurities. And you know what? It's ok. She ends up happy. I think Fielding tells us, through Bridget, that we're going to be ok, too.
B005LAIH3G|3.0|The only reason I never saw this movie in the theater is that the one nearest me that played it is a miserable theater.  I really, really wanted to like this movie, based on my enjoyment of the books.<br /><br />Let me start with the good things.  The scenery and CGI were great, as was the cinematography.  The retrofitted 3D wasn't terribly bad, though there were scenes where I could remove the 3D glasses and not notice much difference.  Still, the 3D did enhance the movie.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  The leading actor and actress were just bad.  He actually only did one scene in the movie where I actually gave a damn about the character ( where his finding his home burned and family dead, on Earth, interspersed with a somewhat overdone battle scene on Barsoom).  Her's was a plastic, single-dimension performance.  Two of the supporting actors were given so little to work with, it was a shame.  Ciaran Hinds is a good actor capable of a lot more than a simple, do-anything-to-survive \\"leader\\".  Willem Dafoe is capable of finely crafted facial expressions and speech patterns that he was wasted on Tars Tarkus.  Mark Strong played the same character he's played in every other role he's had...except most of his lines were dull and predictable.  That leaves me with the direction and screenplay.  Surprise!  The same person was involved in both.  Andrew Stanton might have had a role in the Toy Story series, Wall-E and Finding Nemo, but where he does good writing for animated fish, toys and robots.<br /><br />Sorry.  I wanted to enjoy this so much, that I am, perhaps taking out my frustration on the film and being more harsh than I should.  Hopefully, it will be one of those films, that if I watch it enough, will grow on me.
B007V80WUC|5.0|First, I want to explain that this cd probably won't hook you on the first listen.  I know it sure didn't for me, but someone told me to give it a few more listens.<br />After the 5th listen, I was completely hooked.  It's almost as if Circus Maximus created their own genre of music.  If I had to categorize this cd, I really couldn't do it.  There are so many styles of music, which keeps the cd extremely fresh.  I expected an Isolate part 2 (I listened to Isolate at least 1000 times), but I got something with every song sounding uniquely different.<br />Circus Maximus are truly setting the bar high on Nine.  There is so much talent oozing from this cd.  The melodies are absolutely fantastic, and repeated listens will reveal the magic contained within.  A must for any prog, metal, rock fan!
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a really hot story about two screwed up people. It is almost as good as fifty shades of grey. I was not expecting the BDSM to come into play. I look forward to the following books in the series. The writer has made me care about the characters.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|Entertaining. I liked it. Marky Mark did a good job acting. If you like action adventure movies - reminds me of a lot of the 80s/90s \\"classics\\" Terminator, Rambo etc shootem up movies. Has a little bit of a Bronson \\"Paul Kersey\\" revenge feel at the end.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|I am a combat veteran currently on active duty who suffers from anxiety and PTSD.  This album seemed as though it spoke directly to my fears.  The lyrics are very powerful, and through soothing tones speak about anger and fears, and eventually understanding and overcoming them.  This album has helped me a great deal.  I never expected so much out of a gift.  5 stars.
0765316994|4.0|Redshirts<br />John Scalzi<br />Tor, June 5 2012, $24.99<br />ISBN: 9780765316998<br /><br />In 2456, Ensign Andrew Dahl is euphoric to learn he has been assigned to the Universal Union starship Intrepid to work in the xenobiology laboratory on the journey on Away Missions.  Dahl notices that veterans hide whenever the bridge chooses staff to work a mission and that ship Captain Abernathy, science officer Q'eeng and astrogator Kerensky always join these deadly assignments.  Additionally, usually at least one of the junior officers drafted for these tasks die while Abernathy and Q'eeng return without a scratch ready for the next assignment and Kerensky though battered joins them.<br /><br />Dahl and others investigate what is going on when they meet a crew member hiding.  He explains that the Intrepid's enterprises adhere to old scripts based on the principal \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before\\"; which means death for support cast who fail to boldly go into hiding.<br /><br />This is an engaging lighthearted metafiction that obviously satirizes Star Trek.  The storyline is lighthearted fun but never quite gels.  Still fans who enjoy something different will appreciate the crew's avoidance mantra as they know on all Away Missions, one of them must die.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B004GUSG4M|4.0|What if you woke up each day next to a strange bed partner and looked in the mirror to find a 20 year older version of yourself, having forgotten the past 20+ years, including the person you married.  This is the fate of Christine who has been unable to create new memories since the age of 29 when she was seriously injured in an accident.  In addition to being unable to store new memories, she also lost some old memories and cannot even remember being married.<br /><br />Each day, her husband explains the situation to her and leaves her alone in the home while he goes to work.  You might think that a book about this person would be relatively boring after the initial shock each morning, but Christine soon finds her hidden journal where each day she writes a bit about her day's experiences as she attempts to fit together the pieces of her puzzling life.<br /><br />The initial premise is fascinating and there was plenty of mystery and intrigue here and it was easy to sympathize with the complications of Christine's existence.<br /><br />There was a significant plot twist near the end that really did defy credibility and, unfortunately, following that, the remainder of the book was too difficult for me to swallow and I found the conclusion particularly dissatisfying.  But the majority of the book was a fascinating page-turner.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said?<br />I had never read this author before, and when I saw the 1st part of Wool was just a short story, I didn't even bother with it. Next thing I know, there are 5 parts to it, the reviews are stellar, and I am out of reading material, so I bought it. And thank goodness I did, otherwise I would have missed one of the best books I have read in quite a while. By the first couple of pages I practically was inside the silo. Another couple of pages and the characters were alive. And in no time, I was totally immersed in the mystery of the silo, the cleaning, the lost data...<br />In my opinion, the 1st chapter is the best. In fact, it's genius. I understand that keeping up that brilliance throughout the whole series is a tall order, but that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. The whole series is excellent read, but the 1st part blew me away. The surprise ending is nothing short of stellar.<br />I only have a word of caution for people: if you do buy this book, make sure you start to read it at a time where you have several free hours in front of you. Because once you start it, you won't be able to put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is like one of the best games I have ever played really like one of the best games ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|These are really good books. They make you a part of the book and you just want to know what happens next. You can't these books down.
B0086700CM|3.0|the game it's self is great. I'm sure I wasn't the only one waiting for this to come out on the kindle. BUT the game glitches so much it sometimes doesn't recognize you've moved until it's too late. Though the game it's self is a definite 5 stars I can't say the same for the app. If you have an Ipod stick to playing it on that. For a free app it's worth it but I would never pay for this.
B00004NKEO|5.0|One of my all-time faves and it still lives up to the hype, just brilliant. Nice to see Iggy still filling the venues too.
B007WULJ5G|4.0|First of all a lot of other reviewers said this film was the goriest film and most bizaare they had ever seen. Not me this film is shocking and has plenty of gut churning moments in it but the end was predictable when he remembers when he walks in the warehouse in the last 15 minutes. Dont get me wrong the film is very good and a great lead performance so I will give it that. To me the most shocking film I have ever viewed is Nekromantic. To me its the most sick and twisted film I have ever seen and I dont think any other film will change my mind. So if your a sick and twisted film fan as I am definetely check it out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have been very happy with this app. Has been accurate so far. Love the ease of use and satellite map view.
B0088TG252|5.0|This is what a movie should be!  A great ride from start to finish!  Ryan Reynolds played the role of \\"newbie\\" agent to a T, and Denzel was excellent!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This was another promising title only to be ruined by the inclusion of OpenFeint. OpenFeint should be only offered as a separate download. Every app that I have ever installed that included this unwanted resource waster, always leaves it installed, even after uninstalling the game that included it, leaving it in the device's file system.
B00846F1YW|5.0|fun and very detailed! lots of rooms and lots to find! interesting and humorious storyline as well. well worth the money!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We've watched all of the series and can't wait for next season to begin. If you enjoy British programming, this is a classic production, well worth the investment to save for future viewing
B007N85ZXY|3.0|For many die-hard fans Neil Young is The Man, who has surprised us so many times in the past 40 years (not always in a good way) that it's no surprise he's done it again.<br /><br />`Americana' sees Young re-united with rock-n-roll band Crazy Horse to re-work 11 (in the main) old folk standards. Almost all these songs pre-date 1900 and a few have their roots in Europe, having entered North America in the pioneering days via immigrant minstrels to be adapted into songs all American children learned; others are home-grown hence true `Americana'. The dark themes of some of these songs - murder, execution, lost love, possibly incest - belie their children's playground associations, and the treatment of the songs here does at least restore the sinister edge to the stories they tell.<br /><br />The Crazy Horse renditions sound like a long jamming session recorded in one take, with verbal banter between the musicians filling the space between the songs. The music is loud, raucous, full-on, unsophisticated: it could be a second-rate warm-up band churning out standards at a Saturday night small-town gig and maybe, knowing The Man, this might be intentional. After a few numbers of heavy-rock treatment the album begins to sound samey and dull, and it occurs to you that Young might be `having a laugh': is he really serious about this? There's no light and shade, and the delicacy for which his career-best work is so respected is completely absent. However as Young belts out the vocals with gusto and the band rocks, it's easy to imagine some of these numbers going own a storm at a lively house party in the early hours,  the irony of a heavy rock treatment of `Clementine' and `Oh Susannah' in perfect step with the wild party mood. One might almost see a parallel with Mel Brooks' `Springtime for Hitler' in his movie `The Producers' for sheer kitsch and bravado. One is even more reminded of The Sensational Alex Harvey Band earnestly performing the Tom Jones hit `Delilah' to a result more intentionally comic than ironic.<br /><br />Contrast the Crazy Horse treatment of the song `Gallows Pole' (which allegedly originated in Finland) with Led Zeppelin's equally intense but more dynamically imaginative offering on their 1970 album; or the finale' `God Save the Queen' in which Young runs together the original British and modified US verses to the same tune, with the vitriolic shocker from the Pistols in the 1970s, and these recordings don't seem so imaginative after all. `This Land is your Land' however, manages to hit the mark and might turn out to be the definitive version of this old folkie standard.<br /><br />Like the cover art, the accompanying booklet designed by Shepard Fairey is a genuine work of art with a font size so tiny you'll need a magnifier to read it. All the songs' lyrics are printed in full on the right-side page, and on the left-side page each song's history is chronicled. Nice touch.<br /><br />Overall rating? Good hard-rock stuff but as a musical milestone, not great: `After the Gold Rush' or `Harvest Moon' it ain't, no sir. However you have to give Young at least three stars, just for having the balls to pull off this hit-and-miss project with such conviction.more intentionally comic than ironic.<br /><br />Contrast the Crazy Horse treatment of the song `Gallows Pole' (which allegedly originated in Finland) with Led Zeppelin's equally intense but more dynamically imaginative offering on their 1970 album; or the finale' `God Save the Queen' in which Young runs together the original British and modified US verses to the same tune, with the vitriolic shocker from the Pistols in the 1970s, and these recordings don't seem so imaginative after all. `This Land is your Land' however, manages to hit the mark and might turn out to be the definitive version of this old folkie standard.<br /><br />Like the cover art, the accompanying booklet designed by Shepard Fairey is a genuine work of art with a font size so tiny you'll need a magnifier to read it.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is sooooo fun.  very addicting.  my 17 year old son told me about.  now I'm hooked.  even thou you can use real $ to purchase points it is not at all necessary.  the game has several levels of challenges to keep you striving for yet another high score.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I read enjoy this game and it give me something to do when am at work bored. my nephews really love it. you should get it and have some fun.
B006XBSAP2|1.0|Sad. Yes, so many people may just LOVE Katy Perry, but so many people don't realize and know how much of a true fake she is.<br />1. She does not write her music.<br />2. She does not help produce her music.<br />3. This may be an opinion but since majority rules, I think we can all agree she has a pretty bad voice.<br />4. She is money hungry! A re-release 8! Singles. 2 Perfumes! A MOVIE! The price of things at her concert!<br />5. She is a copier. Their are tons of similarities between everyone, but she has STRAIGHT COPIED many artists. Biggest was when she cut her hair to look like a man, just like Lady Gaga!<br />Her biggest flop. The One That Got Away? Released in3 different versions? She wanted that song to reach number 1 so bad, thank goodness it didn't.<br />Now! I know no one is perfect, but Katy is truly a fake. I know fans won't believe it but it's right their. In your face. This album may have had 5 US number 1's but The US (NOT EXACTLY) is the only country she does great in. EVerywhere else? The UK and US, Asia Oceania and South America, No.<br />She changed  her image to make everyone fall in love with her and thats not okay
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is very insightful and smart. The use of the racing terms and descriptions were great for this nascar loving lady. You fall in love with the dog who is smart, loyal and loving. I believe that this book is a good read for women, men, and dogs! I enjoyed it from cover to the end. What would the world be like if dogs could talk and had a  posable thumbs?

B005T87QCI|3.0|it's a good game overall but it should have a few more things.This game has a bad selection of characters and no storyline.This app should have had at least hat the character Atom in it/the main character of the movie.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have never been a huge punk or Green Day fan. Before American Idiot, the only song that I liked from GD was Good Riddance. But AI opened me up to a whole world of self-expressed angst. AI is basically Allen Ginsberg's Howl meets a cracked out Peter Pan. Anyway, every song on this album is easy on the ear which is more than one can say of most punk bands. One can still express anger without blowing one's eardrums out. Each song, especially Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, flows melodically each other. All of the harmonies flow seamlessly into each other. Plus, the album's political angst will mark it as the album that defined the generation of the early 21st century. The most moving songs are City of the Damned and We Are the Waiting, while Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and St. Jimmy are fun songs to sing along with. Ultimately, American Idiot is destined to be a classic, along with the Beatles' Abbey Road and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game.It helps me when I'm bored.Which to me is completely awesome! But I'd really love it if they made it easier to move stuff around.
B007SGM084|3.0|I read all three books in the trilogy.  The whole time I'm waiting for the plot line, for something other than BDSM sex.  Some great detail of sexual exploits but I really needed more.  The main player's problems kept hinting at more.  All I ever got was more sex.  I feel I spent too much money on something that had very little plot line.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Can't wait for Season Three!!  I loved watching Moriarty.  The writing and the acting was superb.  Sherlock is just quirky enough to make you love/hate him.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|After seeing many Tweets about this book, I decided to give it a try. To me the first couple of chapters were slow- but I still couldn't put it down. If I didn't have to sleep I would have finished it in one night. I got so involved in the story, that I didn't realize I was on page 200 of 294. When I got to about 254 I posted a Tweet that I was upset the story was ending- I didn't want it to. I finished the book shortly after and I need more. Not necessarily Sophia's journey, but that book seems to show that the story is no where near the end. Can't wait to see what happens next!
0375842209|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Not only the touching story of a young girl experiencing Nazi Germany, but the beautiful writing. I love the author's words. It's gripping. It's hard to get me absorbed into a story, and this one did a fantastic job. The language is so well done I find myself rereading sentences simply because of word choice. The whole thing is so wonderful, story and all. I would absolutely recommend this book. You are sure to be taken away by it. Don't rush when reading, let the experience live with you and carry you off for a while.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This senior female will gladly give this movie Act of Valor five stars!  Yes, it is fiction but probably based on real events.  It is breathtaking to see true Navy Seals performing instead of actors pretending to be Navy Seals.  Every branch of service has brave men and women (heroes) but Seals have the extra special training, ego, and requirements to perform an all out variety of extreme missions where others cannot perform.  This is an action packed movie that is well done in almost every aspect and one that will leave you breathless and so grateful for their service.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|You have to download the driver first. Like other reviewers, I was surprised this sort of thing didn't just automatically work.

To remove, un-mount the card (click eject in the Finder), the push the card in again, and it pops out.    One should note that the PCI Express slot on your MacBook is also spring-loaded.  I did not find any problems inserting Transcend card reader into my MacBook, and it doesn't seem likely that you will accidentally remove it when you just want to remove the card.    If you're having trouble, push with the edge of your fingernail.

B0069JBKHI|5.0|We debated long and hard between the withings smart baby monitor and other highly rated home security baby monitor substitues on Amazon.  We are very happy with our choice.  It was a breeze to set up and works well in our house (~3,000 sq ft).  We are able to access the images from our iphones and ipad simultaneously which makes it very conveniant.  The night vision is clear.  The ability to speak through the iphone, turn on music and lights are an added bonus.  There is a slight lag which is about 2 secs. Not bad.  Priced competitively.  Just slightly more expensive than the top rated radio frequency monitos at BabysRus but totally worth it.

While this could very well be a stand-alone novel, reading the first novel in the series will help set the stage for this, the second of the Clifton Chronicles.

1932100660|1.0|Before you read the China Study and create the foundation of your diet on the belief that EVERY and ALL single protein from animals is bad and that the God of Vegan will doom you to eternal illnesses, please read Denise Minger's analysis of the China Study in which she spent 3 months reading and graphing the data from the actual study itself in a 900 page book.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Ms. Minger is not sponsored by any foundation, she understook the China Study analysis in order to help people (especially the vegan community) see a 360 degree paradigm of their belief of what is the ONLY and RIGHTEOUS diet.  The China Study has become a vegan bible, and like all religion people will die defending it.  And vegans are dying through physically degenerating - rapid aging, baldness, falling out of teeth due to rapid and uncontrollable decaying, depression, wasting away of muscles, loss of mental and physical power, dementia, unable to reproduce, loss of menstrual cycle for women, loss of motivation for life, for study, for work, family, etc., and a closed mindset which is scared to look at the fallacy of their vegan beliefs because they have lived and preached this \\"truth\\" so vehemently such that the unraveling of their belief would mean admitting their mistakes and changing who they are, which people will rather die than do, sadly.

It sucked me in...tossed me around...stole my heart...broke my heart...mended it right back up again...and left me with a brilliant smile on my face when it was all said and done. Yeah, it was that freakin good!<br /><br />I loved everything about this book...everything! I didn't want to put it down but hubby did one of his famous `Honey it's 2 am turn off the light'. I really need to invest in a small book light...or at least get the new nook with the glow light. But I picked it right back up the next day and anxiously read until I was finished. Gah, gah, gah! How awesome is Travis? Pretty darn awesome I say! I instantly fell for him. And no matter what he did I still loved him. In fact...I thought that Abby was the one that peeved me off the most throughout the book with her inability to trust and just let Travis love her. But if it wasn't for her issues and his own...this book wouldn't have been as great...in fact it would probably be down right boring. McGuire, you did an awesome job and it was such a fantastic book.<br /><br />This is definitely a must read. Yes...it's more for the older/mature YA reader or adult readers due to its content. Oh and I heard a song on the radio today that was just perfect for this book. Its `You don't know her like I do' by Brantley Gilbert. And this part of the song is so Travis when going through the many valleys with Abby...<br /><br />You don't know her like I do<br /><br /> You'll never understand<br /><br /> You don't know we've been through<br /><br /> That girl's my best friend<br /><br /> There's no way you're gonna help me<br /><br /> She's the only one who can<br /><br /> No, you don't know how much I've got to lose<br /><br /> No, you'll never know how much I've got to lose<br /><br /> You don't know her like I do<br /><br />Right? Am I right? Go read Beautiful Disaster...and you can thank me later.
1469984202|5.0|I bought this because it was cheap and I had some time to kill. The first part was written as a stand alone and it was good. You can kind of feel the hiccup as part two starts and it's a little slow but press on. By the halfway mark of part 3 I was fully engaged and knowing this is a bit trite I simply couldn't stop reading. My plan is to read all of his books now. This was a real find and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|The 4th album from this Baltimore duo radiates a near-perfection of the genre.  \\"Bloom\\" captures<br />  a gorgeous, hauntingly dreamy celestial magic.  It's a place where lush songscapes are imbued<br />  with a mystical & majestic beauty.  Beach House haven't changed the narcotic sonic bliss of their<br />  style; they've perfected it.  These are the kind of songs that remove gravity from the equation,<br />  allowing the listener to float on sustained aural rapture for sixty minutes.  Everything here, from<br />  Victoria LeGrand's angelic voice to the perfectly integrated chiming guitar lines & soaring<br />  keyboards; from the heavenly, encompassing swirls of hypnotic dreampop ecstasy to the crisp &<br />  warm production, is spot-on.  References bands like the Cocteau Twins, Memoryhouse, This<br />  Mortal Coil, Mazzy Star, Exitmusic, Low, later period Blonde Redhead.  This is an album to<br />  treasure.
0345803485|1.0|Gave up on it 1/3 in, skim read remainder.  Skipped sex scenes, read for plot, and it never got any better.  It's horrible.  On too many levels to count but<br />*laughably poor writing<br />*offensive romantic message champions choosing a controlling and abusive relationship because the emotionally unhealthy hero is complicated and you want to join him at his unhealthy level, subjugating yourself to all this just so you can \\"love\\" him into health - character gasps at idea, can't fathom it actually, that SHE might not be worthy of HIM, although all that makes him \\"worthy\\" is looks and money<br />*boring, there are long passages where you just read flirty texts back and forth between the characters.  despite s&x scenes, it STILLS fails to titilate, unless perhaps you have a limited sex and porn life and the shock value or fantasy play gets you.  honestly, there was nothing hot about these sex scenes to me at all.<br /><br />this book is horrid and doing a disservice to women who want real life love, romanticizing unhealthy bad boy cliches and subjugating of one's entire self-esteem to man...
B0072IVGZG|4.0|The Cult return with their 9th studio album of classic arena rock with big, punchy guitars and Ian<br />  Astbury's iconic rock-star vocals.  It's what they do, and this time out, they do it really well.  If you<br />  like crunchy, driving guitar rock that delivers the goods, with hints of earth-shaman mysticism<br />  and an abundance of attitude & swagger, this one will keep your fist pumping and your heart<br />  racing. If you would rather hear the latest cool electronic/hip-hop band, heed the words of the<br />  Cult:<br />  \\"Should have killed me the first time<br />  Gonna live to regret it<br />  You don't stand a chance<br />  You poor little hipster\\"<br />  Sometimes recalls the Doors, the Mission U.K., Soundgarden, Jane's Addiction, Led Zeppelin.<br />  Gotta love the rock!
B0086700CM|5.0|i think that this is the most fun game in the world i love it when i first looked for it i couldnt find it but i finaly found it
B007QXU0ZO|2.0|Really?  I know negative reviews tend to be unpopular here, but either this band has lost something or I've lost the ability to appreciate them.  Whereas 2009's \\"Up From Below\\" had a plethora of irresistible chant-along folk-rock choral epics and was packed with infectious harmonies & addictive melodies couched in big open-hearted anthems, \\"Here\\" seems thin and uninspired by comparison.  These are down-home hippy commune sing-a-long folk/Americana/gospel tunes with hand-clapping, two-step, crowded back-porch rhythms and dreamy, quasi-religious lyrics.  The album really just fails to materialize into anything meaningful or entertaining.  Sometimes, at its best, it reminds of the Polyphonic Spree, Dead Man's Bones, Antony and the Johnsons.  Mostly, it's just boring.  Okay, I guess you can tell I'm disappointed.  Ready for the backlash & negative votes.
B0083EXW50|5.0|As a long time Fear Factory fan, I love this album.  The sound while not as gritty, reminds me a lot of Demanufacture, while there is a slight tinge of Obsolete, in sound and the over-all concept feel of the album.  Musically, this album is very charged and after a few listens feels like one of my favorites.  I love the industrial sounds throughout the album, only fitting that they should be there, perhaps that is another reason it resonates of Demanufacture rather than Mechanize to me.  If I have one complain and it's a weak one so far the lyrics don't seem as memorable as some of my FF favorites.  That being said, I've listened to this album over and over all day.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run looks so much better on the kindle fire! I wish they would have had this all sooner but I'm glad they got it now! I am addicted! It's a great buy!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I saw this in theaters and is is an amazing movie!! Someone said this is not a recruiting movie, well, they were wrong. I do not know if they only had it for the theatrical release, but at the end they tried telling you that you should join the military. Overall, I love the realism, it truly does inspire and get you pumped! The acting was good for people who are not necessarily actors.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Good movie but pretty much just average.  Trailor made it seem as a great action packed movie but it did not live up to the hype for me.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I don't care if it tells you to buy money just hit no or x button I like this game so screw you guys ha ha
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game full of fun and adventure. I highly recommend it.it can be challenging at times but that's what is most fun about it./
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These are the most enthralling books I have read to date! What a great story! For mature audiences but very well written and not trashy like romance novels. Kudos to the author.
B006UTJ6DM|5.0|Buy it, listen to it, sink into its Titanic loveliness.  Sorry, I love the music from Titanic.  This is a great bundle of extra music from the movie, which also happens to include the original soundtrack music as well.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|Having heard this book mentioned, or read references to it, for many years, I was anxious to get a copy and read it. The style of writing, however, and slow pace of action (or would that be non-action) so put me off that I just could not force myself to read it all the way through. I could only read a couple of pages before becoming totally bored and moving on to something else.<br /><br />This isn't Tom Clancy, folks! Keep looking ... there are a lot of better writers out there.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Received this movie right on time, it was in good shape and I was very pleased!  This was the second time I had ordered it, the first was from another company and they sent me the wrong movie.
B007EC27QM|4.0|it's easy to use and big numbers help a lot. and I got it for free. what else can I ask for?
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing and you should totally buy it.......but when you play sometimes the game has glitches. the game can become sketchy and sometimes freezes up on you. I think it is simply because this game is not owned by kindle and is mainly owned by apple. i played temple run on my sisters I phone and it doesn't have these problems.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Yep. What the tittle says is true. I will give you a tutorial on how to get this paid game free. Step 1: Download the Getjar app. This is perfectly legal and is safe to use. Step 2: In the search bar of the Getjar app type Angry Birds Space. See it and download it. Step 3: Youll notice it is full of ads right? Well the company needs you to have good Wi-fi to see the ads. But what if you have bad Wi-fi? The ads are gone and you have this exact game for free. So turn off your Wi-fi and you have it.- Problems: The app picture will be blurry. This will only happen because it is downloaded from another source. There will also be updates for the apps and you wont be reminded of the updates by Getjar. So when you hear of a new update for this game just go to Getjar and download the game again. All previous user data will be saved. I hope this was helpful to you people out there. I also wanted to say a new Angry Birds game will come out in two or three weeks. It will be a racing game. Thats all. Ba Bah!
0739368044|2.0|very disappointed.  I had listened to Books one, two and four in this series, and this one (book 3) had a different narrator.  the original narrator<br />was on a audio CD and available, but Alibris did not state in the information on the product that there were two narrators.  It is<br />unpleasant to listen to a book with totally different pronunciations, dialects and language.  characters were given vastly different<br />voices.  it totally decreased the enjoyment of this book.  I had unfortunate interchanges with the audiobook vendors, and it was not<br />their fault.  Alibris should certainly note the name of the narrator on any trilogy or series.  In this case, most of your customers<br />expected Gerard Doyle.  This is the first time I have been disappointed in Alibris.  and the problem is easily corrected.  please reply.<br /><br />thank you.<br /><br />lsw
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing any one would like it it is so addicting and I promise you wont get bored get it
0307477479|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much...the story line was well crafted and the author evoked some nice imagery throughout.  I enjoy these type of books with overlapping lives of characters so may be a bit biased but worth a read for anyone looking for a funny, edgy book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great series.  I have enjoyed reading these books so far.  A great buy on my Kindle is a bonus!
B005TBQS0Q|1.0|Robin Williams is a genius at acting when he has a good director.  This movie is a series of adlib performances loosely strung together. Very tedious.
B0086700CM|1.0|when I deleted it then I couldent get it back<br />but I orgoniley liked it but now not like it so much because I cant get it back
B006CHML4I|3.0|The dial is smaller than I thought it was going to be but this is a good summer watch to wear on weekends
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this game but I really hate that it lags so bad. it sometimes causes me to die and when I'm in the hundred thousands I could cry. other than that I love it so much.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|**NO spoilers in this review** This book was obviously rushed. I couldn't stay interested at all so I just gave up and googled the plot. After spoiling what happens in the end I'm SO glad I didn't waste my time reading it. Such a shame too because the first book was amazing.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Has problems at times be prepared for totally drained batteries sometimes within the day. Overall, excellent sound quality. However too much sound is leaked. Regardless still an ultrapremium set of VC headphones.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason Mraz does not create music for sales or fame, nor does he have a formula that fits the mainstream music scene.  And for this reason, he is my hero.  He creates music simply for the love of music, and only sings what moves him and comes from his heart.  And this is why he got 5 stars from me, because this music is simply heartfelt and real.  No gimmicks, no WORDPLAY.  He's outgrown some of the wordplay, and that's fine with me.  I love his old stuff and I love his new stuff and I appreciate where he was at the time with every song.  He stands out above the others, and as long as he stays true to himself, he always will. Every song on this album moves me in a different way, makes me feel a different emotion.  It's ALL great stuff.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Bought this cd for the song Marry Me. The reason--my daughter walked down the aisle to it. Of course the other songs (aka Hey Soul Sister) are pretty great too.
B0074JODP8|4.0|this dvd is very well produced and the sound is executed perfectly.  I highly recommend this to any guitar enthusiast.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I love this flash. It is great for those who are new to photography and want either a flash on their camera or off camera flash. If you are new to flash photography I would recommend spending the extra money on this flash as opposed to a less costly one. Unlike some cheaper after market flashes this communicates with the camera and adjusts it's settings accordingly.<br />A couple of things that I wish I had known, something that is not included in the product discription is that it comes with a case, diffuser, and two custom gels. Also be advised, flashes eat batteries up no matter which brand flash you purchase. I would highly recommend purchasing quality rechargeable batteries for which ever brand flash you purchase. The quality of battery directly effects the flashes recycle time, flash intensity, and usage time.
0756405890|5.0|This novel was absolutely mind blowing, and i'm not past the 200th page yet!!! it's so masterfully written, that even characters mentioned in passing are more compelling than most heroes or heroines from other novels!
B003L77GG0|5.0|Arrived well in advance of promised delivery and was new as described. Played all episodes without issues.<br />I have enjoyed the entire series and would recommend the Smallville series to any and all who like Superman. While the story does not follow the same exact story line as the movies is follows well enough that you can enjoy this take of the legend of Superman. My biggest regret is that the series is finalized and there will be no more Smallville from this group.
0307949486|1.0|After struggling to get through the first 200 pages of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I have been hard pressed to come up with a reason for its huge success. I can overlook the fact that it was a bestseller in Sweden-- they have to have SOMETHING to read during their long, cold winters-- but I am utterly at a loss to explain the success of this novel in the United States. For that matter, I am at a loss to explain the laudatory comments by famous writers on the back cover-- I keep scratching my head and wondering if the writers of the quotes actually tried to read this book.<br /><br />I have a 100 page rule for books-- if at the end of 100 pages I am not totally engrossed in the book, I give it up and go on to something else, because life is too short to waste time reading something that is not enjoyable. I gave this book an additional 100 pages simply because so man people have said such wonderful things about it. However, the second hundred pages were not any better than the first. The book is just plain, out and out boring. The main character is not, as you might think, the girl with the dragon tattoo, but a journalist, Mikhail Blomkvist, is the main character. After being convicted of whatever Swedish statutes deal with libel, he accepts a job offer, ostensibly to write an old man's biography. In actuality he is asked by Henrik Venger to research a very old family mystery and figure out who, if anybody, killed Venger's niece, Harriet,thirty years before. Blomkist goes to stay at an island that is even colder than Stockholm.<br /><br />The book moves at a tortuously slow pace and spends endless pages detailing the excruciatingly slow interview process. It is impossible to develop any kind of interest or sympathy for Blonkvist. The character of tattoo girl is slightly more likable, but only just.<br /><br />In short, the characters are boring, the storyline is non-existent. There'd be more entertainment value in watching the grass grow. I'll never get back the time I wasted reading the first 200 pages, but I certainly don't have to waste any more time on the remaining pages of the book.time I wasted reading the first 200 pages, but I certainly don't have to waste any more time on the remaining pages of the book.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|What can I say? This is the MI trilogy on Blu-Ray. Nothing more, nothing less. The quality of the MI:1 is pretty grainy, but then again it was filmed quite a while back and was released on VHS. There are no extra features, no bloopers, just the movies. But at a great price!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Fast shipment and brand new product exactly as described. Item shipped a day after I placed the order. Great price also! Thanks so much!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!! its really entertaining, and I love how you have to think fast in order to get past another obstacle. It challenges the mind and ive been playing for about half an hour straight!! ALSO its funny how it has little notes at the top when you die...YOU REALLY NEED TO GET THIS APP!! ITS TEMPTING.... ITS FREE!!!!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I have the same complaints as others. Hard to pick up the last few pieces. Unable to click on pieces without clicking ads as well.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I saw John Carter on opening day and it's a good movie despite its flaws in the story. It's problem is it's too long and too short at the same time. A $250 million dollar budget was a trouble sign from behind the scenes that gather big media attention from Disney's controversial marketing started with reshoots, title charging from John Carter of Mars which at the end of the movie mentions the original name which ended up being called just John Carter overall then the firing of the controversial marketing executive then the film bombs due to terrible marketing which some people avoided the movie in theatres while other chipped in $73 million dollars and having Disney to take the biggest loss ever in film history a loss of $200 million and the resigning of the studio chief due it's bombing returns leaving it the year's biggest bomb that later foretold Battleship's bombing! I hope this movie becomes a cult favorite due to it's mismanged marketing, this is a flawed but good movie and thst we won't get a sequel but who knows due to strong home video sales and video on demand and that I would to watch it again but now, we can experience John Carter on blu-ray and dvd with deleted scenes that was turned down by Pixar's trust including an alternative opening and watch the making of the film. You won't be disappointed with John Carter!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the whole aspect of this game. The animals and the sounds they make.  It's fun! Of course who can resist catching Scrat. So much cool stuff to do and goals to reach.  Give it a try you'll be happy you did.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|This edition has it all! My favorite part being an uncut version with the deleted scenes included. LOVE this purchase!
B0086700CM|5.0|great graphics and truly addicting!!!  so much better on the kindle fire! it is amazing and awesome and good and fun.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I just finished the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy. I must say, it was interesting, suspenseful and the main characters were enduring.<br />But...I wanted a little more background of Katniss and Gale. The book spent a few pages detailing their relationship but I didn't feel Katniss was very connected to Gale. Because of this, it was easy for me to root for Peeta (and why wouldn't I?!). I also wasn't thrilled with the ending of the first book...I know we are left hanging because it is book one but it seemed to just abruptly end. I needed just a little more closure. As for the mutants at the end-how was this possible and why does the Capitol have the authority to do such a thing? (We need more info/background!) Perhaps it will be explained later.<br />It was great book and I am looking forward to the film :)
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Beware: This movie is not what you think it is.  The movie studio spent tons of money advertising a kick-butt action movie with the latest, greatest action star: Liam Neeson.  What you'll get instead is a deeply psychological, slow story with a few bursts of action.<br /><br />The movie starts by showing that Liam Neeson's job is to project the oil workers from wolves and other predators.  It starts a little slow but luckily you don't have to wait long for the plane to crash.  Somehow, several of the men survive but immediately realize they are being preyed upon by a pack of wolves.  Instead of staying by the plane, they decide to huff it out through the wilderness to get back to civilization.  The plot goes downhill from there.  As the men are picked off one by one, you (the viewer) will get more frustrated with the insane abilities of the wolves to traverse ravines and teleport miles ahead of the survivors.  The wolves are also a combination of CG and puppets, which lack realism at almost all times.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that the audience in the theater booed when the movie ended.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that Liam Neeson is a master.  I will love him in pretty much anything he does, and he takes his art seriously.  Unfortunately, he is severely limited by the plot in the movie.<br /><br />I so wanted to like this movie, but it wasn't to be.  This movie was not worth the $10 at the theater and I don't really recommend spending your hard-earned dough to buy it.  Rent with care.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|I watched the 2012 version of The Woman in Black after first watching the one from the 80's. In the 2012 film, the storyline is superb. It made sense, details and background were all covered and the ending couldn't have been better. This version of the film had more ghostly images throughout, doors opening and closing (why is that so terrifying?!) and a real sense of mystery. Daniel Radcliffe's performance was without a doubt admirable and after the first 10 minutes, I actually forgot about that whole Harry Potter thing...hehe.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I have been searching for a great game to download to my kindle and this was it! So happy with this game :)
B001E2JNA6|5.0|We have waited a LONG time to see Mr. Darcy in HD! The color and picture is superb-I even compared it with the dvd! Perfect in every way!
B0081J9OWC|4.0|Another solid album from Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.  I hate to compare it to their previous one because Up From Below is a great album, 5 stars imo.  Overall I would say this is not quite as good as \\"Up from Below\\".  My biggest complaint is that there are only 9 songs... most of which lack that pizazz found on so many of their songs on the previous album.  I found several songs sounding the same and slightly repetitive.  The tracks that are good, I can't stop listening to.  A good album, 4 stars for only having 9 tracks.
B0076NAWWA|2.0|I bought this album based on my love of the instrumentalists - Morse, Morse, Portnoy, and LaRue. But the end result is that this CD rotated out of the car CD player in less than a week, and never made it on my iPod/iPhone either.<br />There are a couple of good guitar rhythm parts, recorded using Neal's Dual Rec. And one or two good guitar solos.<br />But Casey tries way too hard to be like ColdPlay, and comes off sounding like the Chili Pepper's vocalist singing flat. While there are some good pop hooks on the album, especially in Blue Ocean, it can't get over this hump. And face it, the players don't mesh with this style of vocal or music. Neal tries to be poppy, and you can hear his influence come and go. The drums sound like Portnoy trying too hard to be Ringo.<br />Overall I was disappointed.<br />In an interview Casey was asked what he thought about his bandmates, especially Neal. He replied, essentially, that \\"Neal is a good keyboard player\\". Ouch.
B003NJPOAQ|4.0|Good album, I am not, nor have I ever been a Jack Johnson fan.  However I kept hearing these songs on the radio and through Shazam found them all to be on the same album so I bought it.  Great easy listening album, can let the whole thing play in my opinion.  I have tried listening to his other albums but can't get into them.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I love this game although you have to buy the hints : ( So plz HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ftjugg dtdyxtfycyfycyg cycyfycych hchfycycyc jcycycyc gfucydsdf fydtyfyctsyct ctxtcgcgcgcy rdtdrdygy tdrshv ctxh ftsygu dh tsdfgxd dfgfxf
B004UID2LC|4.0|works great but the only thing I  don't like is that after you download the first song all the songs downloaded after use the same album picture as the first one. but other than that the app is awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game couldn't wait for it to come out on android market. My brother taunted me with his apple store for months.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is really fun! it entertains me ... alothough it is sometimes hard to get special items...but other thsn that this is funny and it rocks
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Post-ap scifi has a tendency to be road movies - people moving through a desolate landscape. This is a different take on the end of the world - in fact, as the novels start you don't realize the world has \\"ended\\" at all. That realization, the realization about what the world is really like, comes creeping page by page, death by death, discovery by discovery. An awesome book!
0439023491|5.0|The book awesome.  I could not put it down.  It was a great middle story that can bring the beginning and the end together.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very fun game. everybody should download this game. if you love love fun goofy games then you will love this game.
0439023513|5.0|A great end to a wonderful series.  Completes the \\"Hunger\\" that is created from page one of book one.  Could not ask for a better and more complete end to a captivating story.
B005SJIP1E|4.0|There was an uncertainty as to which remasterings this box contained. The website of Sonymusic Germany (that's dot de) indicates that these are \\"2008 remasterings\\", which hinted to the fact that this is a budget reissue of the Carnegie Hall remasterings, [[ASIN:B001TIQT98 Mahler:  Complete Symphonies (Carnegie Hall Presents)]], \\"first-time remixed and mastered from original multi-track analog tapes\\". That set is copyrighted 2009, but one could suppose that the remasterings were done indeed the year before. Further pointers were that this new set has Bernstein's first version of symphony No. 2 with Lee Venora and Jennie Tourel, like the Carnegie Hall set (he remade it in the mid 70s with the London Symphony Orchestra, Sheila Armstrong and Janet Baker). It also adds Kindertotenlieder (Bernstein's second recording, with Janet Baker, the first one was with Jennie Tourel in 1960) which was not on the Carnegie Hall remastering, and that does NOT appear on Sonymusic's website as \\"2008 remastered\\". Also, comparing a few audio samples on Sony deutschland's website to my own Carnegie Hall discs, they certainly sounded the same (although, with such samples, you can never be sure how accurate a notion they give of the genuine sonics). The only puzzling factor was that Sonymusic dot de does not indicate the \\"2008 remastering\\" for the 6th Symphony, and the matter got further confused in the ensuing discussion that you can follow in the \\"comments\\" section, when customer R. Lane mentioned that \\"item descriptions for this set on Japanese sites quote Sony that the CDs are made using the 2009 DSD masters that were created for the incredibly expensive Japanese SACD releases that same year\\". The argument didn't entirely win the day, though, since those SACDs are listed on Amazon Japan has having been issued in 2007, not 2009, and that evidently is incompatible with a \\"2008 remastering\\". So, ultimately, I wrote to Sony Music Classical Deutschland and they confirmed that these were indeedthe Carnegie Hall remastering. So until someone who owns that Carnegie Hall box and/or the Japanese SACDs buys this new set, compares, and claims otherwise, we can take this as the \\"official\\" truth.<br /><br />And indeed that Carnegie Hall remastering represented a major and even revelatory sonic improvement over any other reissue of the Bernstein-Columbia cycle (calling it a \\"New York\\" cycle would be an over-simplification, since the 8th Symphony was done with the London Symphony Orchestra). I had parts of that first Bernstein's Mahler cycle from the mid-1980s, reissued by a company that still was called CBS back then, and I was perfectly happy with that, and I also had the 5th symphony on the later Bernstein Century edition, [[ASIN:B0000029XH Mahler: Symphony No. 5]]. Just recently I reviewed Bernstein's 9th from that cycle, in the early CBS reissue, [[ASIN:B00000DS77 Symphonies 7, 9 & ,10 \\" Adagio \\"]] - one of the significant milestones in the composition's recorded history and one of the fine versions from the 1960s, although one that in many aspects appeared to me as only the embryo of interpretive things that Bernstein would fully realize in his later DG recordings (see my review of [[ASIN:B00000C298 Mahler: Symphony No. 9 (Bernstein Century)]]). But what really made it a non-runner today was, I realized, its sonics. Although it is not something that struck me as I was first listening to it, comparing it with Bernstein's 1979 live concert with the Berlin Philharmonic on DG ([[ASIN:B000001GFX Mahler: Symphony No. 9]]), switching back and forth between both recordings to compare some particular details, it jumped at me how dulled Columbia's sonics were, at least in these early 1986 transfers. And it really ruined any intentions that Bernstein might have had, robbing the climaxes of much of their impact, smoothing out much of the orchestra's instrumental pungency. Athough bettered by the Berlin performance of 1979 (and already by the one with the Vienna Philharmonic from 1971 available on DVD, [[ASIN:B000AC5BFC Mahler - Symphonies 9 and 10, Das Lied von der Erde / Leonard Bernstein, Christa Ludwig, Rene Kollo, Wiener Philharmoniker, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]), the 1965 New York recording was good enough interpretively to make this highly frustrating.<br /><br />So based on various reviews and advices I bought the Carnegie Hall box and indeed, although ALL the sonic problems of the 9th have not been solved, the improvement is so phenomenal as to be revelatory. The differences aren't so striking with the 5th compared to the Bernstein century edition, but they aren't negligible either. For more details, see my review of the Carnegie Hall box.<br /><br />So, as I concluded in that review, if you want Bernstein's first Mahler cycle, this is now the edition to get. As for the interpretations, many listeners seem to have an adoration for Bernstein's Columbia cycle (and many probably learned their Mahler through that cycle). I don't entirely share the enthusiasm: not that the Columbia cycle isn't excellent, but, at least in the symphonies I know best (1, 5, 7, 9), I think Bernstein probed deeper in his DG remakes. And no wonder: the first cycle was recorded early in his long career as a Mahler conductor, which really started in 1960, with the New York Mahler festival which he shared with Bruno Walter and Dimitri Mitropoulos. His 4th with Reri Grist was recorded that same year, followed by the 3rd (1961), the 2nd and 5th (1963), the 7th and 9th (1965), the 1st and 8th (1966), the 6th (1967). For DG, in some cases, he'd had an added quarter of century to mature. But some listeners may also think that he probed TOO deep in the remakes and dug himself into an expressive ground. Old Bernstein was like old Klemperer and old Barbirolli: he could be slow and massive. I think the genius of Bernstein (like Barbirolli - I'm more ambivalent with old Klemperer) is that he pulled it off brilliantly.<br /><br />But be aware that with thisbudget reissue, while you gain Baker's Kindertotenlieder, you loose the 1972 Das Lied with Ludwig, Kollo and the Israël Philharmonic, and the invaluable interviews made in 1960 of the musicians from the New York Philharmonic that had played under Mahler 50 years before. That was an edited version of the complete interviews, made for the LP release of Bersntein's cycle (which the Carnegie Hall box seeked to emulate, except for the later Das Lied and Adagio of the 10th). The complete interviews were reproduced in the invaluable box of Mahler archive from the New York Philharmonic, [[ASIN:B000Q62254 New York Philharmonic - The Mahler Broadcasts 1948 - 1982 [RARE]]]. There is a price to pay for not paying the price.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|I know,like a-lot of people said.\\"bad acting\\"Was involved,but that did not matter to me.I loved this movie for many reason's.But what i really liked about it,is that the fact,that every now and then,the scene would go into first person mode,as if you are looking through the eye's of the solder,i think that was really awesome.i do not wanna say much,because i know most of you who are reading this,most likely did not watch the movie yet.But just know this,if you where thinking about getting this movie,don't think no more,just get it,believe me when i say this movie is worth the $19.99 plus tax.And as for the case for this movie,it is also amazing as well,i loved the fact that,you have big bold gold letters embossed,and also how all six solider's are standing in a line,and the background is an image of the sun setting.The picture is a gloss type texture.So with that being said i loved the movie,and me being a collector i loved the case.Thank's for looking.
B00773YOB4|5.0|I purchased this album after reading a review stating that Bonnie had taken back control of her work when she returned to recording. The results are stunning. Each song seems specially chosen to suit her voice and music style(s), and the lyrics are mind and heart candy. Each performance rings true to the feeling of the song. This album makes me think; makes me cry; makes me laugh; makes me feel angry and tender and joyful.
B003DZX3US|5.0|If you don't have this movie,i have three word's for you,GET IT NOW!!!!.I love this movie i remember watching this Disney classic,when i was a little kid.Well time kept passing me buy,and i finally decided to buy this,and i am happy i did,now i can watch this movie anytime i want,if you have not seen beauty and the Beast,all i have to say is where have you been?My favorite part of the movie,as i know it's probably almost everyone's favorite part,is when they both come down the stairs,and begin dancing.This is one of Disney's Greatest movies made,if you do not have this i recommend to pick up a copy,i know when i bought this,the price was cheaper,but even if i did not buy it,and i had to pay this amount i would.but not only would you be buying this for yourself,but you are also buying this for your kids,or grandkids etc.i know watching this movie was a great experience for me when i was little,and i think it will be a great experience for the next generation as well.

B00746O3X8|5.0|I don't know the Cotton Carrier so I cannot compare, but functionally-wise, this is going to help my neck a lot.<br />The knobs to be attached to the cameras are metal and seem to be just fine. I don't know if this is expected but I got 4 with my harness, together with four rings and two keys.<br />The rails in which these knobs are supposed to slide are made of hard plastic and seem to be resistant enough. I am somewhat weary of hanging much weight from a battery-grip-equipped camera, though; if the lens does not rest on your body, the weight and motion might induce lots of torque and wear the rails faster.<br />I still find it convenient even with my grip-equipped 7D when using a long lens: I attach a knob to the lens tripod ring and hang it from there. It is very convenient, whether attached on the chest or on the side.<br />I found that the angle at which the knob is best positioned on the camera depends on whether you wear the camera on the front or on the side. Don't forget either the provided key or some screwdriver if you want to change it.<br /><br />The security strap that attaches to the camera I find marginally too short and the attachments proper are plastic. I am not absolutely sure how efficient they would be at stopping a free-falling 5lbs camera+lens (but I do not intend to try).<br /><br />Now the good surprise is that the side attachment can be used on its own on any belt. Choose a comfortably broad belt and velcro the thing around it, and you can carry a camera right there without any weight on the shoulders.<br />While this is not convenient in all situations, I find it very efficient when only using a shoulder strap: the camera does not bounce around and the shoulder strap only provides the security. It works perfectly when attaching the knob to the lens and the shoulder strap to the battery grip.<br /><br />Suggestion to Opteka: sell as a separate product the side mount and a thin, light shoulder strap for the security and I will be advertising it.<br />______________________________________<br /><br />Updated after a two-days shoot in NYC - I used the full harness on one day and just the side on the other day and I confirm my impression: the safety lines are somewhat light but the ensemble is fully functional.<br />Only thing to think about when using only the side (not the full harness, i.e. not the way it was intended in the first place) is where to attach the safety line - I had a backpack so it was not a problem except you want to make sure that you untie the camera from the backpack before you drop the latter.<br />I still change my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />Two years later: I have nearly not used this since that earlier week-end in NYC. I find that it is less practical than a decent shoulder strap in most situations, although I still thought it would be good for motorcycling, climbing or skiing with a camera. I find I use my top-loader pro from Lowepro for these occasions.<br /><br />I pop that star back out: the harness works as intended but I just don't need it.g it.<br />______________________________________<br /><br />Updated after a two-days shoot in NYC - I used the full harness on one day and just the side on the other day and I confirm my impression: the safety lines are somewhat light but the ensemble is fully functional.<br />Only thing to think about when using only the side (not the full harness, i.e. not the way it was intended in the first place) is where to attach the safety line - I had a backpack so it was not a problem except you want to make sure that you untie the camera from the backpack before you drop the latter.<br />I still change my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />Two years later: I have nearly not used this since that earlier week-end in NYC.

B007Y36K46|5.0|Amazing movie.  I wish there would be sequel but I guess that isn't going to happen.  I was pretty pumped to see this movie after reading the reviews and the movie did not disappoint.  The story is original.  The visuals are fantastic.  And the movie kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was going to happen next.  I'm  probably going to order the books now after watching this movie.  There's still so much that needs to be told or explained.  But overall, I recommend this movie it is good for all ages and filled with adventure.
B002KEDQJQ|4.0|I really liked this movie. It's very creative, and they did the best job they could to follow the comic book with the time they had. It does have one really bizarre sex scene that I didn't really like, and it's not like I'm a prude, but it just was... weird. Haha. Anyway, other than that this nerdy girl really enjoyed it.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found The Night Circus enchanting.<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern wove a world for me that I wanted to live in. My favorite parts were the results of the duel between Celia and Marco - wonderful, imaginative additions to the circus that I wished with all my heart I could see, taste, touch and live in for real.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the extended cast of characters and the amount of depth and involvement they were given. If you care to further examine certain characters and aspects of this tale by letting your imagination turn over sentences and explore subtle hints - this novel becomes truly remarkable.
0345803485|5.0|I'm attached.  I am absolutely sucked in.  I am not a reader, whatsoever.  I am a college student so have very little time to actually read for my own pleasure, but wanted to give this one a try when I started hearing the buzz.  BUY IT.  You will love it.  And make sure you buy Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, as well.  They go together... I made the mistake of only buying the first one on Amazon first, just trying it out, and finished it in 5 days and was in misery over the weekend waiting for the second book to arrive in the mail lol... Yes, they are pretty sexually explicit, but there is MUCH more to it and you will fall in love.  I promise.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I was so excited for this book to come out. I've read all of the Percy Jackson books to date and the first one in this complementary series about Greek and Roman demigods left me hanging and I couldn't wait to pick up the next installment.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I love Rick Riordan's books in the same way I love James Patterson novels. They are dependable yet intriguing reads. I wish Janet Evanovich would take a hint from them; it's how I used to feel about her Stephanie Plum series.<br /><br />When I read a Rick Riordan novel I am never disappointed and I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. The Son of Neptune was no exception!<br /><br />It picked up right where The Lost Hero did and I enjoyed it immensely. There were demigods, demons and gods left and right. Riordan did a nice job of incorporating the Roman and Greek versions of gods and the respective camps. Percy Jackson is also growing up nicely - the series reminds me a lot of Harry Potter in that way. I loved reading about Harry growing up. I got to the end of the book and it cut off at a great cliff hanger. I'm ready to pre-order the next installment already!
B00881VLCE|2.0|I found this too irritating to play because of the poor interface. Whenever I would try to drag a puzzle piece from the list, it would scroll instead. You have to tap and hold the piece before you can move it to the puzzle area which ruined the flow of the game. Furthermore, everytime you picked a piece it would get needlessly magnified which made it hard to place, particularly when moving a larger cluster of several pieces.<br />  I didn't like that there was no frame for the puzzle, so the pieces were always just &quot;floating&quot; and you couldn't lock them in place. This also meant that the most recently selected pieces were always on top, hiding other pieces beneath them. In a better designed game, once you placed a piece in its correct location it would go to the background and become unselectable so that you only need to click on active pieces, and they would never be hidden.<br />  Another irritating thing was that the puzzle wasn't scaled to my kindle fire, it was just a few pixels too big.  I only tried the first kitten puzzle but quit from frustration.
0307341577|5.0|This book is pitch perfect, and the writing is phenomenal.  I haven't read a book quite like it.  The way Gillian Flynn constructs her sentences, makes her points just sharpens the characters and plot, and forms an intimacy with the setting.  What a great antihero she has in Libby Day!  Libby Day is a liar, thief, of the dark Day blood; she is famous for being the only survivor of the murder of her family.  She is abusive with those who want to help her, particularly her aunt Diane, and Jim Jeffreys who cares for her and watches over her money.  Because her money is running out, she lets herself be invited by Lyle of the Kill Club to speak to the club and interview witnesses.  For Libby Day, it is merely a business transaction, but for others, it's a search for the truth.  Many of the Kill Club and others don't think Libby's brother Ben committed the murder including the author of a scandalous book.  It's amazing how innocent things can be interpreted into a snarling mess, and good intentions lead to evil.  This book kept me gripped, and I love the characters, the plot, and especially the writing - I'm awed at how Flynn carves out this world with her beautiful words.  Her other book, Sharp Objects, is just as good.  I'll continue to read her books, and I'm looking forward to reading Girl Gone.  She's managed to accumulate a fascinating oeuvre in a short time.  She has become one of my favorite authors.

B005K2KCPG|3.0|This is not a criticism of the album, but the quality of the Amazon MP3s. The bit rate must be really low, judging by the samples. The music has that tinny sound as if it's being streamed from RealAudio in 1999. Even today's deal of $4.99 for the album seems expensive for this quality.
B005ZWPR06|5.0|Inspirational!  Was it worth waiting 40 years for it?  Well, maybe not, but now that it is finally here, it is great.  The harmonies are, as usual perfect and always interesting, and the material diverse ranging from the avant to the predictable, with Brian's masterful genius throughout.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|General impressions, not a track-specific review; too new.  Will add track review later:<br /><br />So: I'm spoiled.  Having just seen the Broadway show this past Sunday night 6/3/2012, with the sublime duo of Emily Padgett & Justin Matthew  Sargent in the leads with a stellar supporting cast, I just bought this to compare the 2.  Nothing, including this, beats the stage version, but while I await my Amazon delivery of that recording (which does not have my Sunday people anyway), this movie version, which was released this morning, is still awesome as its own animal.  I'll talk about that:<br /><br />TOM CRUISE can sing!  That is, if you consider Axl Roses' chill-worthy wail singing (I do).  Because Tom channels Axl quite eerily, and IMHO, pulls it off.  Very well.  His voice reaches crazy range.  Pretty shocking.  He supposedly got to 5 octaves; I believe it after listening all day.<br /><br />Julianne, sorry to say, does not fare as well.  She is an adorable performer, dancer, etc.. but this role calls for a real (powerful) Broadway style voice, and she is very weak vocally, although the EXCELLENT production/studio tricks prop her up very well, so she gets by overall, but with the wonderful Emily Padgett vocals still fresh in my head from the Broadway show, all I can say to Julianne's vocals is, meh.<br /><br />The young Diego Boneta in Justins role is great from what I am hearing.  VERY strong vocals, especially in the Foreigner ballads which really call for a clarity and strength so as to hit it out of the park, which he does, (although still not as magnetic to the ear as Justin Sargent.  Sorry!)  Still great.  But that killer Broadway cast spoiled it for me I fear!<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a faithful, but Catherine-sounding rendition of Pat Benatar's HMWYBS.  Nice.  You can hear CZ-J's distinctive speaking voice in there.<br /><br />All in all, all our favorite rock-out tunes from the early 80s are here, with a fresh spin for thats what classic music is, here for the ages for new generations and new iterations.  I think that if you love this music, and loved the show, and excitedly anticipate the movie, as I do, you will love it!<br /><br />For all you purists who can't stand to see your favorites duplicated/transformed/reinterpreted, you are all sadly missing the point!  Is there only one version/interpretation of Beetoven's 7th?  How many wonderful Beatles covers are there?  The fact that early 80's rock is being celebrated this way just means it's achieved classic status!  CELEBRATE & ROCK ON!!<br /><br />Bottom line: Tom Cruise is a revelation, Diego too, great production, great recording, NOTHING though, tops the current Summer 2012 Broadway cast, but this movie recording IS AWESOME, SOUNDS GREAT, the lush sound engineering/production/arrangements are stellar & Grammy caliber, so kudos to the producers.  Comparisons aside, I LOVE this CD & it will be played by me non-stop for ages to come.<br /><br />Will update as I become more familiar with the individual tracks.<br /><br />Nicole S, New York, NY, 6/5/12ic is, here for the ages for new generations and new iterations.

B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I liked this app--at first. But I've lost so many files on my Android that I'm seriously considering uninstalling it. I like that I can do things like italics and boldface in a document. But saving a document is a risky business. I can't just save to Dropbox. I have to save twice, fist to OSP6 and then again to Dropbox...if I'm lucky. In the past week, I've lost three files. Files that were supposedly saved to OSP6 are nowhere to be found. I lost a file I tried to recover. And the app will often fail.<br /><br />I have Docs to Go and Quick Office on my Kindle Fire. Both are better than this!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids and I love this game.  My husband has a hard time seeing the value of it, but they learn about saving, weighing and making decisions about what to buy or not, how to work within the limits their parents have set for the use of the game, etc. For instance, my oldest is constantly reminding her younger sibling not to buy eggs too late in the day, because she will be asleep when it's time to hatch them. Our only problem has been the emotional outbursts when something goes horribly wrong, like when the two year old spent all the 12 year old's acorns on the Kung Fu Scrat game!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was searching for a new book and noticed that The Hunger Games - books 1 and 2 were in the top ten at that juncture.  I also noted that these were youth novels, so didn't really focus on them until hearing from my 68 year old step-mom AND 11 year old granddaughter that The Hunger Games was the best book they had each read - ever.  I thought that it might deserve a good read if it could capture the attention of a diverse age group.  I was curious.  After hearing from others about the story line of this series - children fighting to the death - I thought I would find it unsettling to say the least.  However, that aspect is NOT played out in a gruesome manner. It is more a story of survival of the fittest, the struggles in each District of this futuristic environment and the ongoing battle with those at The Capitol.  I am intrigued with the character development, imagination and writing style of this author.  I am on the third of the trilogy and am anxious to see the movie now and find out how closely it matches the book!  I'm also curious to see the actors selected for each character.  If you're considering reading this book or trilogy, you will not be disappointed[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]].

Even tho it says you dont have to on the box make sure you do. After you recalibrate it worked great! It made the playing area much closer and worked perfectly with my room constraints. Sure it does a fish eye type effect on the picture but that is not a big deal when before I couldnt even play the game. Anyone having a problem with room should definitely get this.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|It's nice to hear the sound of some new Beach Boys material. This new album (\\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\")has some nice songs with an uplifting spirit.The first song and the last 4 songs are the strongest cuts that give the album some consistancy. The rest of the album is pleasant but (in my opinion) is not as good as the cuts I mentioned. The albums repertoire consists of some fun laid back songs that kind of remind me of earlier Beach Boys albums (like \\"Today\\"), as well as somgs that remind me of the \\"Pet Sounds\\" era.<br /><br />True Beach Boys fans will want to seek out the QVC version of this album which contains an extra disc with 11 bonus (hit) tracks. The Japanese pressing of this album also contains a bonus track (the 2012 version of \\"Do It Again\\"). This track can also be found on the exclusive Walmart album (Beach Boys \\"Zine Pack\\") which comes with a nice photo book and postcards.<br /><br />I am disappointed with the album cover artwork. The back cover is ok but the front cover needs improvement. It doesn't do justice to a first class band like the Beach Boys.<br /><br />All in all, \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is very well done, far from a masterpiece but very nice indeed to listen to. It invites the listener to recall the days of summer sun, waves,and the times spent on the beach.It also seems to hint that although we can look through the glass window and remember \\"times gone by\\", those days are now gone but remain in our hearts forever.<br /><br />Side note- Check out the CD by Alan Boyd called \\"Channel Surfing\\". Alan Boyd had a hand in directing and producing many of the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson projects. The Beach Boys actually sing on this album (as indicated on the live cuts), and you will feel like you are listening to an undiscovered Beach Boys CD! In my opinion,these songs would fit nicely if they could be added on to this new album.
0345803485|1.0|After managing to make it to the end of this book (only did it because I'd already wasted the money on it - there was no turning back), I was so very annoyed by how utterly bad it was, I quite literally felt robbed.  I mean, considering how much buzz this book generated, I was expecting something like Anne Rice meets Jackie Collins.  This was more like norovirus meets intestines.  This book is a best seller?  I couldn't seem to wrap my head around that fact.  Had the world gone crazy?  I went online and started looking for reviews to see if there were others who were just as puzzled as me, just as ticked to have fallen for the media blitz on this stinker.  I came across a brilliant review on veryaware.com and posted it along with a word or two of my own on my FB page.  Many of my female friends thanked me for warning them that this book is just tripe and hype.  One of my friends, however, who just luuurrrves those God awful Harlequin romance turds, started defending the book and she hasn't even read it yet!  I tried telling her about how bad the writing is and how the author drives certain phrases and words into the freaking ground, but should she decide to actually waste her money on this dung heap, she should keep count of how many times the author writes \\"He pressed his mouth into a hard line\\" or \\"Stop biting your lip\\"  or \\"I stared at my hands\\" or \\"My inner goddess\\" (anytime I caught a peripheral view of the word \\"goddess\\", I immediately skipped the entire paragraph) or \\"I blushed\\", etc., etc., etc...OY FREAKING VEY!!!  MS. JAMES, DO YOU OWN A THESAURUS?!?!?!!<br />I must give a shout out to DS from LA for their review on Amazon titled Bestseller? Really?? for posting the exact number of times this hack bludgeons the reader over the head with these phrases and words.<br />The only good thing to come out of this waste of wood pulp is that my faith has been fully restored in my own writing skills.  If THIS can become a best seller AND make its way to the big screen, certainly I can squat over a toilet and come up with something absolutely brilliant!

A documentary of epic proportions.  Its really too bad that we have a system of corrupt politicians and business leaders running this country.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Excellent read! fun twists and turns throughout. Characters unique and develop well over story line. Good intrigue and good insight to secret governmental levels....or portending to be such!

0525478817|5.0|I liked this book sooo much. John Green creates endings that make me think... everything will be all right! It was just a joke and everything will return to normal... but it doesn't sometimes, and that's what makes the book so awesome! I would definitely recommend this to others.
B004L0NGEC|4.0|Love it. Easy to upload, easy to name, sort, add captions and keywords for easy filtering. I wish videos over 100MB would download, but you can't have everything.<br />With this app, you don't need a gallery. Now if only there was an app to remove the one that came with my device...

B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a great game.  Not too challenging but enough to keep it fun and interesting.  A few spelling errors but good graphics.  Very satisfied with this game.
B0018RFLN0|3.0|This was the first MI out of the gate. I think Tom was too young not convincing and the story was predictable. I really like his new MI G Protocal
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addicting! It is fun and very very simple to play. I do wish that there were more upgrades to get in the game. other then that I highly recommend this game for lots of mindless time wasting fun:)
B004A8ZWWY|5.0|Sometimes I feel Ben Stiller plays the same type of character, and yes, this is one of them BUT the story doesn't dwell on only him, it's about the others too so I didn't tire of him in this one. Many funny parts and clever twists. I have watched it several times and I think it deserves the 5 stars.
B000A0GXGA|4.0|If memory serves, this DVD listed for about $10, or certainly not much more, when originally released.  Demand was so great that it quickly sold out, and continuing demand naturally bid up the prices being sought by dealers who still had unsold, unopened, original copies.  Amazon, I believe, has always listed it as a single disk totaling 149 minutes, and if purchasers outraged at paying through the nose for a single disk totaling 149 minutes bought their copies ELSEWHERE, it would be sporting to note in their Amazon reviews that they were not victims of \\"outright fraud with malice\\" on THIS site. If they paid what they consider an exorbitant price for this item EVEN THOUGH Amazon has always CLEARLY LISTED it as a single disk totaling 149 minutes, it would be only fair for them, while cautioning others not to make the same mistake, to acknowledge that culpability lies with their own inattention rather than non-existent fraud and malice on the part of others.  That being said, the two key points to made about this DVD are: (1) It contains three irresistible episodes in the series' comic vein, all starring James Garner, though Jack Kelly is also nicely represented.  (2) Now that the complete first season of \\"Maverick\\" has finally been released and is available on Amazon for under $30, you will probably not want to pay TOO much more than the original $10 price for these second- and third-season episodes while waiting for those sets to be released--though \\"Shady Deal at Sunny Acres\\" and \\"Gun Shy\\" in particular are so wonderful that I can see why you might be tempted to jump the gun.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book made me laugh, I found it entertaining in the way of a romance comedy genre.  A  modern version of the same plot sensibility of the ole bodice ripping books that many of us read when we were young women.  I wonder what Kathleen Woodiwiss would think?  I'll never forget my girlfriends and I all sharing the same prized book, The Flame and The Flower and blushing and tingling as we read the steamy sex scenes.  Worry not about the absurd...its fiction, enjoy it!  We the girls, now mature women that read those romance novels  back in the day, turned out to be fabulous mothers, with wonderfully adventurous and diverse careers and values.  We are astronauts, doctors, lawyers, business entrepreneurs/ leaders, teachers, activists, feminists, politicians, pastors, world leaders and many other heroic roles!!!
B007SGM084|3.0|I read this trilogy in less than a week. I will never get those days of my life back.<br /><br />Here's the thing: this trilogy is NOT to be taken seriously. The writing is amateurish and you can pretty much tell from the get-go that you are reading what once was fan fiction.<br /><br />Christian Grey is TOO beautiful, we are reminded of this every single time the \\"heroine\\", Miss Anastasia Steele lays her blue eyes on him. He is also incredibly rich and for no apparent reason other than being gifted when it comes to knowing what to do in the business world... whatever that means. And he is 27. Okay. Moving on.<br /><br />Anastasia is, as expected, an adult version of Bella Swan, but even more ridiculous. She is sexually innocent, too innocent, to the point of being ignorant. She is twenty one years old so I am pretty sure that any able bodied young woman, even if she hasn't had sex, is not completely surprised by the fact that \\"that thing goes in here! Oh my!\\" She is also very attractive and many young, hot males are after her. But she doesn't think of herself as attractive because her best friend, Katherine Kavanaugh, is hotter. Yes. It's like that.<br /><br />But we can forgive those things... this is a book to be read only if you want to turn off your brain for awhile and not think. At all. About anything.<br /><br />The sex is not as scandalous as I was expecting. Then again I am a lawyer and a psychologist so maybe I've read worst things in my case studies and this doesn't surprise me. In the first book, the sex scenes didn't feel like they were too much because we were being introduced into this world. On the second book, you begin to wonder if it is necessary that the author write in detail every sexual encounter these two have. By the third book you might find yourself, like me, skipping the scenes altogether because, quite frankly, they are pointless.<br /><br />You might be wondering: what about the plot?<br />My answer: WHAT PLOT?<br /><br />Like I said earlier, this book is not to be taken seriously. This is mostly a love and lust story. The most interesting bits came whenever Christian Grey talked about his past life (that was fascinating and by far, the best part of these books). Oh, sure, there was a horny, ex-Dom wanting Christian back and there was also a blast from Christian's past that came to haunt him and Anastasia but those two figures are shadows in the back of what truly matters to this author: her hero and heroine getting it on in every possible surface, vehicle and hotel room available. There is a bit of character growth on Christian's part but Anastasia is pretty much the same throughout the series: a beautiful, shapely young woman with self esteem issues that needs constant reassurance of: a) how sexually appealing she is and b) how much Christian loves her, in spite of the fact that EVERYONE tells her to the point that it becomes annoying. She also believes it is imperative that we understand that she is not in love with Christian because of his money or how hot he is... Which kind of makes of wonder WHY she fell for him at all? He is not kind, he is arrogant, self important, controlling and has deep psychological problems.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />The bottom line is: if you want to read a sexy, kinky trilogy that would be amazing had it explored Christian Grey's past in more detail but since it didn't you shouldn't take it seriously: this is your book. If you want a smart, sexy story about two interesting, engaging characters then go find something else to read. You have been warned.

0765316994|5.0|This tale of the lives of the 'throwaway' characters, becoming self-aware of the fact that they're mere cannon fodder for some larger story - that honestly isn't all that well-plotted - is multileveled genius and hugely entertaining. It's just the right kind of fast-paced, with great characters, dialogue, and send-ups of typical Star Trek-style tropes.  The final chapter made me laugh out loud and the codas follow up with several of the characters at a slower pace; a gentle fade-to-credits. :)
1603427244|5.0|Wow!  I'm impressed! This handy-sized book is loaded with ways to begin and end your knitting. To be precise, there are 33 ways to cast on and 21 ways to bind off. The inner covers conveniently list techniques by category - all-purpose, decorative, stretchy, ribbing, circular, toe-up socks, provisional, etc. There's also a good index that references applications such as \\"gloves, binding off fingerless\\" and  \\"shoulders, binding off\\" as well as techniques. The first pages of each section show side-by-side examples of each method, all knitted in the same yarn for easy comparison.<br /><br />Each technique includes a description, characteristics, suggestions for use, good photos and instructions for working, and hints for \\"getting it right.\\" I like the lay-flat binding and the size is perfect to tuck into your knitting bag. This is an excellent reference book for any knitter, novice to experienced.

B007OTZ654|5.0|Note: This a review of the 40th Anniversary CD remaster, issued in 2012.<br /><br />There is a curious phenomenon happening in the world of Bowie CD remasters, which we can hope portends an attitude change in the music industry as a whole regarding the remastering of classic albums.  This phenomenon is, simply put, going back to basics.  More specifically, it appears as though EMI is actually starting to recognize that the sound of the original Bowie albums, at the time they were made, doesn't require improving upon.  Rather, the best a remastering can do is present the original sound in the most faithful manner possible, from the best possible sources.  This 40th Anniversary remastering of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars does just that.<br /><br />Ironically, the original RCA Bowie CDs from the 1980s, which were lambasted at the time as subpar, actually did a pretty good job of staying faithful to the sound of the original LPs.  Although they are rumored to have been from latter-generation sources, rather than the original master tapes, they have nevertheless held up very well in light of the reissues that followed: the anemic and overly bright Ryko reissues of the late `80s, and the bloated, heavily compressed Virgin/EMI remasters of the late `90s, which remain the standard versions available today.  However, it was the 30th Anniversary edition of Ziggy Stardust that represented the nadir of all Bowie remasters: it sounded worse than even the '90s EMI remaster; worse yet, it actually removed portions of the music and reversed the stereo channels.  It was an absolute travesty that never should have seen record store shelves, and it seemed to confirm the belief among audiophiles and music enthusiasts that the more the record companies tried to justify double and triple dips, the worse things got.<br /><br />Then things started to change.  The Aladdin Sane 30th Anniversary remaster actually was a bit less loud than its previous remastering, and with a more subtle EQ - not quite on the level of the original RCA LP or CD, but definitely a step in the right direction.  Then came the Station to Station deluxe reissue in 2010, which really nailed it, faithfully reproducing the basic sound of the RCA LP and CD, but with the added benefit of going back to the original master tapes for a cleaner presentation.  It was exactly what a remaster should be.<br /><br />This newest release of Ziggy Stardust continues the trend, and may be the best sounding Bowie CD reissue yet.  Remastered by Ray Staff, who engineered the original album back in 1971, this version comes full circle, sounding remarkably similar to both the original RCA LP and CD, but with a bit more sonic pop and presence, as well as clarity resulting from a superior transfer of the original master tape.  This is miles better than either the 1999 EMI remaster or the ghastly 30th Anniversary edition (stereo channels are as they should be, and the segues are restored); it bests the Ryko version, as well.  There is a certain irony that it took four CD reissues just to come back to the sound RCA got right in the first place, but with this remastering, we finally have the definitive Ziggy on CD.  Here's hoping EMI makes this permanently available, and never seeks to improve upon it with a subsequent release.  They really cannot do better than this.ng, and with a more subtle EQ - not quite on the level of the original RCA LP or CD, but definitely a step in the right direction.

1610454812|5.0|This book has become one of my favorite books.  For a guy, listening to a book about a real hero really hits a masculine hot button.  I'm sure that other men will relate to many of the feelings and to varying degrees to the experiences that Adam Brown experienced during his path through life.    Most of us have temptations and sin in our lives and we all have varying success in resisting those temptations.  Adam was man enough to tell his family that he wanted his whole story to be told.  He wanted the low parts of his life and the unwise decisions to be told along with the good times should he not come back from the conflicts.    It was very interesting to hear stories of the extreme level of training that he and his fellow Seals experience.  It takes an incredible person to endure this training.  Adam's tenacity was obvious in the extreme while he fought through physical impediments to his goal of becoming part of Seal Team SIX.    Adam's compassion for others was evident in his acts of kindness to the kids that he saw while over in the war zones.  After hearing about bad things that some of our soldiers have done which have been unfairly emphasized by the press, I was pleasantly surprised and proud of the rules of engagement which called for women and children to be removed from the middle of the violent action even at the peril of the team that was engaged with the enemy.    Paul Michael does a wonderful job of narrating the book.  You really get the feeling that he was part of the action.    Although most know the path that the book is to take, it hits very hard to listen to the life of Adam Brown unfold.  We are used to the great ending at the end.  Adam's life has indeed come to a great ending.  It just is a different ending than you see in the movies.    I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an inside look at the inner and outer battles that our brave fighting men and women endure when they agree to defend our freedoms.    I received this audio book free from [...] Reviewers Program in exchange for posting a review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Picked this up as a free app of the day. I never buy apps but I have to say that this is worth the price. I have already spent hours and am still on the beginner puzzles. I can't put this down. More fun than sudoku in my opinion.

B0001ARCFA|2.0|Headphones fell apart after about 3 months of use. The plastic part that holds the 2 metal bars that go across your head crumbled, and they wound up touching the metal screw in the middle (which shorts it, since those wires around the top actually carry the signal to the right speaker). I figured I'd be clever and repair it with solder/epoxy... which worked after some trial/error. But another 4-5 months later, and I'm experiencing the same problems, which leads me to think it has something to do with the way the bars torque when the phones bend slightly. The product wasn't thrown about or abused, but got regular daily use. As far as sound quality, it was very good for open-air headphones. Very easy to hear people trying to talk to me while gaming (which is what I bought them for). Just wish the quality had been a bit better.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Although this may not be a great movie, it is still one that anyone over 55 should run to see, if you are able. It is so refreshing to see a film not about teenage angst but about adults at the end of their lives taking charge of the short time they have left and living each day to the fullest.  When I saw this film recently in the theatre, the median age of the viewer had to be at least 63 years of age. As I waited in line, practically everyone in front of me said, \\"one senior for `Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'.\\" And the audience didn't talk, didn't send text messages or check their phones. They applauded at the end of the movie too.<br /><br />The film, directed by John Madden, stars  Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.  My apologies to the other cast members if they are well-known. I did not recognize them. I did learn later that the young Indian actor Dev Patel was in \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\"  The subtle soundtrack does not intrude. The acting to a person is quite wonderful with no one actor stealing the show, a good thing I think. There are wonderful lines that will make you laugh although some of them are a bit over used-- we know that old people say they do not purchase green bananas, for instance-- but if you are not careful you will find your eyes burning in a place or two. The movie is based on a novel by Deborah Moggach entitled THESE FOOLISH THINGS. She also wrote TULIP FEVER. One of the characters is seen reading this novel, a nice touch and endorsement for the author. Seven Brits of retirement age all converge on a hotel in India that they have seen on the internet, only to find that all that glitters is not gold. How many of us have had the same experience? Postage-stamp-sized photographs of exotic hotels in far-away places that we find on the internet seldom look like the quarters when we check in, often to a room that we can barely turn around in.<br /><br />Such a fine message this film has: whatever you were planning to do, do it now. We will all be dead a very long time. A great little film that glows.all be dead a very long time. A great little film that glows.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I purchased this book as a result of reading a good reveiw in a local newspaper and it was my first foray into Amazon & the use of my new Kindle.<br />I have struggled to read even half of it ( & what has kept me reading has been that I payed for it ! ) & have no intention of reading any further.It is poorly written with an un interesting story line & as a mature aged reader if that is what is determined as erotica pity help my interest in the subject as this book has almost made me want to return to getting my books from the Library.<br />If I was aware of how to request a refund then I would, to anyone interested in buying this trash please save your money.

B007YJS7G4|5.0|I have never in my life ever wrote a review or chimed in on any internet opinion etc but I had to after seeing this movie. I grew up in the south and I'm a white guy. What makes this such a tear jerker is that all of these guys fought and died for a country that still didn't accept them as men at the time. I just want to thank them for their courage in the face of two enemies and Steven for the courage to put out a movie about them. The movie was good. I felt like I was really up there flying and the effect were top notch. This was not the best movie I've ever seen and could have been better in some ways but I've seen a whole lot worse produced. I cared about these guys and when they finally were invited by the bomber crews to have drinks because of the lives they saved and the quip about you call us colored just had me ROTFLMAO so true. Again we owe these guys so much for a job well done.

B00847TKSE|3.0|This movie is a great family movie and because it is based on a true story not everything makes you happy.  I gave it a 3 because of the casting.  They just didn't seem to fit.  Local people were fine but known stars not so much.
0786955570|5.0|This is a fun, quick to learn game that is worth the price tag.  For the money you get a lot, and the quality of what you get is fantastic.  I have been playing D&D for years and while this is not the whole experience of that, this would be a great way to introduce people to some of the concepts of that game.  I loved it.  My regular gaming group loved it.  My family adores it.

B002RI9ZPY|4.0|This is not only the last story of the millennium trilogy but also the sequel of \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\". What will happen to Salander and Zalachenko after their mortal struggle? Whether her twin sister, Camilla, will play an important role in the story or not? How will the relationship between Salander and Blomkvist go? You can get the all answers to those questions after finishing this story. While Blomkvist is investigating the Zalachenko's background, a big crime organization has appeared being related to the Swedish political organization... The main theme throughout this series is well known as the violence against women. It is also cleared what idea is based on this theme. You will be fully satisfied.

The writers of this show are geniuses in how they combine the different fairy tales so that they work together to create the stories that make this show what it is. The show is for everyone, young and old.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I don't review anything here on Amazon but this movie touched me so much that I didn't have a choice!  Sure the action is great and the Seals do an amazing job, but the story behind it all is really what makes this movie the best I've seen in a very long time.  Around 1% of Americans are fighting for our freedom.  I am not one of them and sometimes I feel disconnected from the people who actually go out there and give me and my family the opportunity to live a life without fear.  This movie really brings the story home so that we can actually feel what these heros go through.  They do it for themselves, for their families, and what's most amazing is that they do it for the 350 million of us who they don't know.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie is a MUST WATCH for every American!<br /><br />God Bless our troops!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I am impressed with all of the choices and variety of puzzles.  I also like that I can choose different levels of difficulty so easily.  This is an app I can share with my kids, too.  My only complaint is the issue with the last two pieces and how they won't move onto the puzzle. Otherwise, I am happy with this app!
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I gave it a three because there is no 2 1/2!!!  I love his movies, but this one just did not deliver.  You could just see things before it happened, and the wolf business was a little incorrect, as I raised wolves.  They made them supernatural, and it was stupid. If is was not for Liam the movie would have crapped, as it was his boldness and role that made it worth watching.  Lets see another \\"Taken\\" or dark man....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book put me in mind of The Stand, my favorite Stephen King book.  Well written with deep character development, you really care about these people.  King also takes you back to the real 1960's - I remembered things I had not thought of in many years.  I felt like I was back in my childhood.  I enjoyed this book immensely and so will you.

076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom is a book with a lesson.  But I kept reading this book wondering if the story was more about making money through a book than it was about spreading the story and life-lessons of Morrie Schwartz.<br /><br />In 1979, author Mitch Albom graduated from Brandeis University.  He promised to keep in touch with his favorite professor, Morrie Schwartz.  But then life got in the way.  Sixteen years later, Albom is a successful sportswriter in Detroit.  He catches a glimpse of Ted Koppel's Nightline in March 1995 and there is his old professor, who is dying from ALS disease.  But instead of dwelling on his impending death, Morrie wants to use it as a teaching tool.  Albom reconnects with his old professor, and they meet on Tuesdays--even though Albom lives in Michigan and Morrie lives in Massachusetts.  Morrie \\"would not wither.  He would not be ashamed of dying.  Instead, he would make death his final project, the center point of his days.  Since everyone was going to die, he could be of great value, right?  He could be research.  A human textbook.  Study me in my slow and patient demise.  Watch what happens to me.  Learn with me.  Morrie would walk that final bridge between life and death, and narrate the trip.\\"  Each week there is a different lesson on a different topic.  The two talk about the important things in life, including life and death, love and marriage, emotions, the world, feeling sorry for yourself, regrets, family, aging, money, culture and forgiveness.<br /><br />The workaholic Albom sees firsthand that money and things aren't as important as he once believed.  Morrie's house was \\"filled with love and teaching and communication.  It had filled with friendship and family and honesty and tears.  It had filled with colleagues and students and meditation teachers and therapists and nurses and a capella groups.  It had become, in a very real way, a wealthy home, even though Morrie's bank account was rapidly depleting.\\"  Albom claims that after Morrie's death, he evolved into a different person--more open, more emotional, more attentive, less driven and more focused on the things that truly matter.  But for as much as I liked this book and Morrie and the lessons Albom is trying to impart, why can't I stop thinking that Tuesdays With Morrie is primarily about money?  At least Albom admits that the advance money helped to pay Morrie's enormous medical bills.laims that after Morrie's death, he evolved into a different person--more open, more emotional, more attentive, less driven and more focused on the things that truly matter.

B0050DIWHU|4.0|\\"The Start-up of You\\" suggests that one should execute one's career in the same way that a Silicon Valley start-up operates. The book focuses on planning, risk taking and most of all, networking.<br /><br />Despite what others have said about this books stereotypical coverage of networking that reads like an ad for LinkedIn, I found the coverage of networking to be balanced and intelligent. Granted, I do not read a lot of books about the topic, but that is because most of the books I have read are not very subtle or specific. This book is both subtle and specific. For example, while some writing about networking talks about the value of weak ties, this book not only gives specifics as to why they are valuable, but also talks about their limitations and further, gives advice on when and how to utilize strong or weak ties depending on context. While the authors illustrate their examples using features of LinkedIn, this does not mean that the advice is not ore generalizable.<br /><br />The fundamental weakness of the book was that it seemed to have been written from a vantage point of privilege. The discussion of planning talks about the role of ABZ planning. The implication of this is that in order to be successful, one needs to take intelligent risks. The authors state that it is unacceptable to take those risks that would result it ruin in the event that one fails. The solution is to have a \\"Z plan\\", which is a plan to follow through if everything goes catastrophically wrong. Some suggested plans include utilizing a 401k for those with families or moving back in with your parents for younger people. If these options are available, good. However, what of the many who do not have the understanding, financial support, or even existence of family or the luck that it takes to have landed a job with benefits in the past? The authors do not say. They are smart enough to recognize that entrepreneurship requires a supportive social environment and that not everyone has the ability to take the same kinds of risks. But despite a brief mention of perseverance and hustling, the authors do not seriously discuss the problems of those with inadequate resources, which is a larger problem than the authors seem to recognize. Further, the examples that the authors give of successful people often have had the advantages of a solidly upper-middle class upbringing in terms of education, experience, and network.<br /><br />Still, the authors have a realistic view of the problems of the current employment environment and have many intelligent suggestions for turning these problems into opportunities.

B0079J28NW|5.0|\\"Yellow Submarine\\" surfaces with a sharp, colorful presentation for Blu-ray. The 4K restoration for the film looks brilliant and is a huge upgrade when compared to the original 1999 DVD. I haven't seen the DVD remastered edition of this put out at the same time but I would imagine it uses the same high def source. The painstaking restoration for the film is evident in just about every frame which is brimming with more a sharper, more detailed image and colors that positively pop.<br /><br />The Beatles (none of the band provided their own voices) are recruited to help overthrow the Blue Meanies when they take over Pepperland by Fred who is going to transport the Fab Four in his Yellow Submarine. Things go awry along the way as Ringo gets launched out of the sub, they meet Jeremy a Nowhere Man who finds helps them free Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band from being kept captive by the music hating Blue Meanies. A truly surreal adventure as Jon Lassiter points out in his introduction in the booklet, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" truly was revolutionary in its day and still looks dazzling.<br /><br />Image quality is top notch with a painstakingly restored image filled with sharper images than previously seen. The film probably has never looked this good even when it was shown in 1968 as film development and projection techniques weren't quite as good back in 1968. In fact restoration efforts can often reveal flaws in a film as the resolution is so much better than before. The aspect ratio returns the film to its original 1.66:1 presentation (vs. 1.68:1 for the previous DVD and 1.33:1 for the VHS as I recall).<br /><br />The lossless audio is marvelous sounding.<br /><br />The special features include a 16 page booklet with behind-the-scenes photos and comments, mini-seri-cels (that resemble the animation cels although smaller and with each Beatle in one of the iconic moments from the film)of each of the four Beatles and stickers.  Audio Commentary by John Coates and additional contribution by Heinz Edelmann<br /><br />Vintage featurette: The Mod Odyssey (7:40), we also get three storyboarded sequences - including two not used in the final film:* Sea of Monsters (4:21),Battle of the Monsters (Interactive), Pepperland (Interactive),Original pencil drawings (8:33), Behind-the-scenes photo gallery as well as interviews with crew and vocal talents: Paul Angelis (voice) (1:39), John Clive (voice) (2:04), David Livesey (key animation) - 1:13, Millicent MacMillan (1:14),  Jack Stokes (3:44), Eric Segal (1:38), Theatrical Trailer (3:45)<br /><br />Plus:<br /><br />16 page booklet, reproductions of animation cells of each of the four Beatles characters + stickers<br /><br />Missing is the music only audio track that was on the previous DVD which is too bad but we do get the original mono soundtrack as well plus a stereo PCM mastered track.<br /><br />This is a terrific reissue that is flawed only by missing the original music only track in 5.1 like the original DVD. It would also have been nice if the MTV Special (or was it VH1?) that was shown back in 1999 had been included or the BBC documentary but evidently Apple chose not to license either for this release. Even though it doesn't have everything it could have, this is highly recommended due to the stellar image and sound quality.<br /><br />Highly recommended.contribution by Heinz Edelmann<br /><br />Vintage featurette: The Mod Odyssey (7:40), we also get three storyboarded sequences - including two not used in the final film:* Sea of Monsters (4:21),Battle of the Monsters (Interactive), Pepperland (Interactive),Original pencil drawings (8:33), Behind-the-scenes photo gallery as well as interviews with crew and vocal talents: Paul Angelis (voice) (1:39), John Clive (voice) (2:04), David Livesey (key animation) - 1:13, Millicent MacMillan (1:14),  Jack Stokes (3:44), Eric Segal (1:38), Theatrical Trailer (3:45)<br /><br />Plus:<br /><br />16 page booklet, reproductions of animation cells of each of the four Beatles characters + stickers<br /><br />Missing is the music only audio track that was on the previous DVD which is too bad but we do get the original mono soundtrack as well plus a stereo PCM mastered track.<br /><br />This is a terrific reissue that is flawed only by missing the original music only track in 5.1 like the original DVD.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Like most other reviewers I have heard some of the live shows prior to Big Moon Ritual, so I knew the album was going to be good. Being a huge fan of both The Grateful Dead & Yes, these are the two influences I hear throughout the entire album. This album has a lot of similarities as The Grateful Dead's \\"Wake Of The Flood\\" from 1973.<br /><br />Adam MacDougal is the man on keys! I loved when he joined the Black Crowes, and with the Brotherhood he lets loose completely making his mark on this album. Neal Casal was the only other member I was familiar with prior to this project, and he delivers as expected (much different that his solo stuff). It's no suprise that whatever Chris Robinson gets himself involved in turns out to be magic.<br /><br />As much as I miss the Black Crowes, I am in no rush to see the Chris Robinson Brotherhood hang it up. I would hope that the two could co-exist in the future to make many more years of wonderful music.

B007KCG7MQ|2.0|I received this CD yesterday.  I like Joe Walsh and was excited about this album.  It wasn't easy, but I forced myself to listen to it all the way through 2 times.  In my opinion, the main issue is the drumming.  The drumming duties are split between Jeff Lynne, Joe Walsh, Ringo Starr, and a drum machine.  Ringo is OK but the others are awful - especially Jeff Lynne.  It sounds like there's a 5th grader playing the drums on the songs where Jeff is the drummer.  Listen to Spanish Dancer and you'll hear what I'm talking about.  They should have hired a real drummer for this album, or had Ringo do all of the drumming.  I also have some issues with the production and mastering.  Not crazy about the packaging - the CD and the DVD fall out easily.  The songs seem decent.  I like the guitar playing.  Just my opinion.
0439023521|5.0|Wow. Ok, I am a very fast reader, NEVER has it taken me this long to read a book. Seriously, it took an extraordinary amount of time to get through. This book is all things I am not, and what it must be like to have the brain of Suzanne Collins....<br /><br />I guess I've been under a rock for awhile, because I knew only that I wanted to read this, didn't know what it was about or the immense hype surrounding it. Honestly it wasn't as violent as I thought it would be (or could've been), and it was totally void of foul language, which was a first for me. It was fast-paced but I had a million thoughts slowing me down: \\"is this sci-fi?\\", \\"is this what the future could be like?\\", \\"is this a political statement?\\", \\"is this a sociopolitical statement?\\", \\"am I reading way more into this than I need to?\\", \\"wait a minute, green skin?? Maybe this is just sci-fi....\\", \\"nope, this is definitely a symbolic book.\\" And so it went for 378 pages...I read one page, then went back two more pages just to make sure I got all of the details correct (then I got to the very end where it states the book was symbolic...but of war LOL. I was still thinking about everything I learned in my college Sociology class).<br /><br />I hate to try to add something that will put a label on the book, and the only thing I would want to convey intelligently is the depth of it. I read one review about the guide to this book, and the woman basically says if you need the book dumbed down then you probably shouldn't be reading it. I actually thought there were multiple ways to interpret it. I may not be all that deep but I was definitely left pondering issues that are, and always have been relevant in society. Well written, looking forward to the next book.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I have been a Beach Boys fan since 1964, having seen them at a concert in Louisville on a whim.  I stuck with them through good times (a great first-time concert with the Kingsmen as an opening act) and bad (when the nasal Mike Love made them a pathetic oldies act). I was worried about this album, fearing it might be thrown together as a quick money-maker.  My fears were unfounded.  Though the album has too much of a retro feel at times, the harmonies are wonderful, as is the seeming harmony within the band.  Sure, some of the lyrics are inane, so what else is new?  The last few songs have especially touching thoughts about aging and, really, their legacy.  This album is not in the Pet Sounds league, but still is a fitting coda to a band that transported this Kentucky boy to dreams of California girls and surfing.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Very high quality Adventure/Hidden Object hybrid. Both genres are represented well here and work well with each other. Hidden objects actually fit the scene they're in, which is (sadly) very rare in games like this. Game is nice and long with plenty to do and nice graphics to boot.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The movie isn't an exact adpatation of the books \\"Princess of Mars\\" and \\"Gods Of Mars\\" but I think ERB would be very happy with this movie. The CGI is fantastic, especially the Tharks and Woola. if you are a fan of the books then by all means you must see this movie, and if you don't know the books you should watch the movie to see what Burrough's mind created. It is not a copy of anything, Burrough's wrote \\"Princess\\" 100 years ago and technology has just now caught up with his vision.  Highly recommend the movie for most of the family the violence isn't too gory considering what is on television these days and there's no nudity or bad language to speak of. All should at least give this a look because you won't be disappointed
B006RUJST6|5.0|This story was simply engaging, I read it in one sitting.  I laughed, and I cried with the characters.  I immediately ordered the paperback novel ( for this book and the sequel)too.  I am going to recommend that my library purchase this book and book two, as I think this is a simply phenomenal read. Wow. I just finished Slammed a few minutes ago and have tears streaming down my face and some used kleenex at my side.
0062082353|4.0|After reading the many negative reviews, I almost decided not to read this book. I thouroghly enjoyed books like Lone Survivor, Service and Red Circle.<br /><br />American Sniper departs for the Standard SEAL format: I grew up in Texas, BUD´s sucked, you have to train hard to be a SEAL......etc.<br /><br />American Sniper reads as if you have a series of encounters-conversations with Chris, perhaps over a beer or two.... Reading the book will not make the reader necessarily like Chris or become his friend, and I do not think he cares either.<br /><br />What you get is an uncut, raw, glimpse at some of what goes through a combat soldier`s mind in modern war.  The book is sprinkled liberally with details like: SEALS do not take cold showers, SEALS earn nicknames....etc. If you like the previously mentioned books, read this one. It will fill in some of the gaps left by the others.
0131103628|4.0|This is a book for introducing the C language itself without too much emphasis on the libraries. Since C is a small language, the small volume of the book is enough to accommodate the essential features of it. The good thing is that it is concise and strict. People can learn the language pretty fast.<br /><br />There is still something I think not so perfect for the classic book. The examples are not focused enough. To make the story-telling more continuous, the authors used some examples that goes larger quickly. These examples are not so large and complex to understand but not focused enough. If some smaller pieces of programs were designed just to illustrate what is being introduced the book will be made easier and more friendly.<br /><br />For those who want a more comprehensive reference of the C libraries you have to look at the C library books.

B00479SVBU|5.0|When I bought this I didn't have very high expectations.  However, it exceeded my expectations.  It was so crystal clear in the quality of sound that was coming out of my radio.  No static, it was crystal clear. I couldn't tell the difference between listening to a strong radio station or the Soundfly.  It is worth EVERY penny!
B004LROMWU|2.0|When I say \\"give it time,\\" I don't mean give the series time to get better.  It's not bad now.  I watched the first two episodes, so maybe I just haven't watched it enough.  Other reviewers have already stated how they don't like the way the series began AFTER the attack is over.  That doesn't bother me so much, but the show is just a bit too slow for my taste.  Anyway, back to why I say \\"give it time.\\"  IF the series catches on fire, it might continue past two seasons.  However, my advice is, wait at least three seasons before you buy this series.  Just like the fantastic Sci-Fi series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, this series might be prematurely cancelled, leaving you up in the air and angry.  OR, just like Battlestar Galactica (the new one, not the old one), this series might have the worst ending in Sci-Fi series history, leaving you even more angry.  So, I would suggest you only buy it if/when it ends well.  Trust me, I've been there with these Sci-Fi series, and I'm a very angry and resentful fan.

0525423656|3.0|The YA trilogy rears its ugly head again!  This is one of those times when it's just not working.  Crossed could have been condensed into a couple of extra chapters at the end of Matched or the beginning of Reached (which will be the title of book 3).  But the publishing company would have lost out on how many book sales?<br /><br />Crossed wasn't terrible.  It's just that it didn't really go anywhere.  Ky runs away to the desert.  Cassia runs away to the desert.  They find each other in the desert.  They love each other, but Cassia still has a bit of feeling for Xander and Ky still has a bit of an issue with it.  They find stuff that helps them find the rebellion.  They join the rebellion.  That's pretty much the whole story.  I told it in one paragraph.<br /><br />If you read Matched, you'll have to read Crossed I'm sure to know what's going on in Reached.  Is it worth it to start the series?  I'd say so, I like it pretty well.  The last book is slated to come out this year, so you won't be sitting around waiting forever for it to wrap up.  They're quick, easy reads.  I recommend the audiobooks, they're well done

B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Over the course of 4 albums and 8 years (plus an \\"outtakes\\" release in 2004), I can honestly say that with every single track, I can find something to like.  With this album, I especially like the track \\"Somewhere\\".  Gives me goosebumps.  And to top all that, seeing them live is as much fun as anyone can have.  I am attending shows 7 and 8 in July in DC.  A small club perfectly suited for , what , a Kiki?
0345803485|5.0|First of all I do have to agree with the bad reviews of people who were annoyed by the British phrases that crop up all through this book and its two sequels.  That said, if you can get past the main character not being \\"keen\\" on coffee or the emails in military time rather than the standard American 12 hour clock, the book is fantastic.  It must be understood that this is a part of a 3 part story, and the overall story is wonderful.  Both of the main characters undergo real transformations between page one and the end of the third book, and there is a real love story rather than just a bunch of S&M scenes.<br /><br />As for why it's set in Washington - read the Twilight series, then read this.  I heard that it was originally published on a website like fanfiction, where people can submit stories based on characters or plots of other published material.  This is not a rip off of Twilight since the story is very different, but the characters are extremely similar.<br /><br />This is a real love story with lots of steamy scenes.  If you don't read romance novels then these books may not be for you.  But I loved them and so did my friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a total guilty pleasure for me. It's hot. I mean, yeah, some of the sex is kinda - eh. And it does at some point get kinda old like, ok, let's get on with the story, BUT it's still great.

B002XUL6RG|5.0|Steve McQueen put himself on the map with Hunger. He established his unique and incredibly subtle style which consists of telling a lot of the story visually. You will notice that there is only a few lines of dialogue through the first hour, yet the story is incredible complex because every single shot adds to the story. This is accompanied by absolute powerhouse performances by Michael Fassbender and every other person in the cast. This movie is very heavy, so sit down and just absorb this work of art.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|It gets an extra star for the cast, but really, what were they thinking? I literally fell asleep about 20 minutes into this movie. There is very little character development, dialogue, or background, all of which would have been helpful to explain the loosely woven fight scenes.<br /><br />Overall this was no \\"Taken,\\" and definitely not a Jason Statham movie (unless maybe Killer Elite). I had such high hopes for a female focused movie - very disappointing.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Obviously, the main story is why most folks buy the book, but I highly recommend that you give the other shorter stories a try also. I guarantee that they will stick with you. The fetish doll story is a classic and my personal favorite was 'Witch War', a three page story that still haunts me! Oh yes, 'I am Legend' is a great story, but don't forget the rest of the book.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Absolutely love the funk sounds on the dance tracks.  Reminds me of all that great dance music from the 70's and 80's. And of course the ballads are beautiful.  This CD is much closer to my musical tastes than his first one (which I still enjoyed very much).<br /><br />I ordered this Deluxe version, and I'm so glad I did because one of the bonus tracks \\"Runnin\\" was a complete surprise.  To me, it's the closest to a real rock song, and I love rock even more than dance music and soulful ballads.<br /><br />For those of you who aren't really interested in funk, electro pop, slow music, etc., or just can't get into Adam's singing style, at least go to YouTube and listen to the full version of Runnin.  You won't believe your ears.  I think you'll really like it... then come back here and buy the single!
B007MDB71O|4.0|Well, if you recently re-read the books, you may be a bit confused at the movie's story. It's almost a mishmash the first two books, but not quite. In any case, it was a stunning movie and lots of fun.<br /><br />Judging by Amazon's bestseller lists, the movie seems to be spurning new generations of readers to pick up other books in the series by Edgar Rice Burroughs - I'm happy to see that, these were a mainstay of my youth.<br /><br />This is definitely worth watching!

B00000IIXH|4.0|Joshua Lawrence Breslin comment:<br /><br />Recently in grabbing an old Bruce Springsteen CD compilation from 1998 to \\"burn\\" and download into my iPod I came across a song that stopped in my tracks, the one highlighted in the title to this entry Brothers Under The Bridge. I had not listened to or thought  about that song for a long time but it brought back many memories from the late 1970s when I did a series of articles for the now defunct East Bay Eye (California, naturally) on the fate of some troubled Vietnam veterans who, for one reason or another, could not come to grips with \\"going back to the real world\\" and took, like those a great depression generation or two before them, to the \\"jungle\\"-the hobo, bum, tramps camps located along the abandoned railroad sidings, the ravines and crevices, and under the bridges of California, mainly down in Los Angeles and created their own \\"society.\\"<br /><br />The editor of the East Bay Eye, Owen Anderson, gave me this assignment after I had done a smaller series for the paper on the treatment, the poor treatment, of Vietnam veterans by the Veterans Administration in San Francisco and in the course of that series had found out about this band of brothers roaming the countryside trying to do the best they could, but mainly trying to keep themselves in one piece. My qualifications for the assignment other than empathy, since I had not been in the military during the Vietnam War period, were based simply on the fact that back East I had been involved, along with several other radicals, in running an anti-war GI coffeehouse near Fort Devens in Massachusetts and down near Fort Dix in New Jersey. During that period I had run into many soldiers of my 1960s generation who had clued me on the psychic cost of the war so I had a running start.<br /><br />After making connections with some Vietnam Veterans Against The War (VVAW) guys down in L.A. who knew where to point me I was on my way. I gathered many stories, published some of themin the Eye, and put the rest in my helter-skelter files. A couple of weeks ago, after having no success in retrieving the old Eye archives, I went up into my attic and rummaged through what was left of those early files. I could find no newsprint articles that I had written but I did find a batch of notes, specifically notes from a story that I didn't file because the Eye went under before I could round it into shape. The format of those long ago stories was that I would basically let the guy I was talking to give his spiel, spill what he wanted the world to heard, and I would write it up without too much editing (mainly for language). I have reconstructed that story here as best I can although at this far remove it is hard to get the feel of the voice and how things were said. This is Jeff and Zeb's story as told by Jeff, probably one of the only stories that have ever driven home to me the hellishness of war and what it does to men's souls.<br /><br />For the record Jeffrey James Adams served in Vietnam from mid-1969 to-early 1970 and Zebulon Samuel Johnston from mid-1969 to late 1971. Zebulon Johnston's name appears in no rededicated wall down in Washington but just maybe it should. Read below why. Josh Breslin<br />**********<br />This conversation took place one afternoon (date, unknown) in late October, 1977 under a massive concrete overpass along U.S. Interstate 5 just south of Inglewood near Los Angeles, California.<br /><br />\\"Ya, Zeb was quite a guy in his time, a guy you could depend on, a guy you could count on, if you know what I mean. Who did you say you worked for, mister? Oh, ya, The East Bay Eye. I still miss the bastard, miss him for leaving me here without a guy I could count on, and will until I leave this good green earth and that ain't no lie, no sir. A real brother, unlike my own brother who sometimes was a brother to me and sometimes just a same last name.<br /><br />Zeb and I went back, went back to basic training in the Army down at Fort Gordon in Georgia. Jesus just remembering that hellhole place and that hellhole time and that hellhole way the good citizens outside in Augusta treated us the couple of times we had weekend passes just like the blacks just because I was a Yankee and old Zeb was from broken down Appalachia, some dink town called Hazard, a coal dust town from what he said about it. A town he always said was full of history and written up in song and in the books. But I had never heard of it, and truth, never have heard of it since so I think that was old Zeb just being old Zeb. Just so you know when you write this story his real name was Zebulon Samuel Johnston, named after his father, his pa-pa he said, simple as that.  And don't call him a Johnson, either. He was a Johnston, born and bred, he said.<br /><br />But the big thing about how we hit it off  right from the start was that first day when we got off that olive drab bus and hit the barracks  and Jeb was bunked across from me and I had to show him how to tie his boots. See, he never had proper shoes from the way he told it and the way he tried to tie those boots before the boot camp sergeant snapped his neck  back for him I can believe that and maybe that was the way things were down in broken down Hazard.  All I know is that all through basic training, through rough woods stuff, Zeb paid me back, paid me back big time, for my minute kindness. See he knew more about the woods, and how to survive in them,  and little tricks about how to use this and that to get stuff done than a city boy, a big time Boston city boy, Yankee to the core, and corner boy smart not woods smart could ever know.<br /><br />So he kept me on, as he said, as his mascot. And anytime he needed some fancy way to get out of something he would yell for me, and then he would be my mascot. Tight we were right from basic. Same tight, and you'd better be tight, or get our asses kicked when we took Advanced Infantry Training down at Fort McClellan down in Alabama where the civilians put Yankees and hillbillies below blacks in the pecking order they had established, or so it seemed every time we had town leave.<br /><br />And then shipped out to `Nam. Ya, `Nam hellhole of all hellholes and I know, know for certain I never would have made it out alive if not for Zeb. See one time after we had a few days off from the line we hit Saigon and jesus, the place looked just like home, or somebody's home if that home was Vegas or one of those glitter town, action night or day. I couldn't leave the place, or want to. Zeb could take it or leave it so he went back first. Well one day, yes, day time he pulled me out of some brothel, some sweet Eurasian  girl specialty house just in time to keep me from being locked up for about six months in Long Binh for being, well, a few days over my leave time.<br /><br />But I am getting a little sidetracked and confused because that is not really the time he saved my young white ass. No that was when we were out in the boonies, out in the Central Highlands, near Pleiku just doing a routine patrol, keeping as far away from the enemy as we could and as close to this little river, a crick  Zeb called it, but really a creek, a little low during the dry season. From out of nowhere we start taking fire from \\"Charlie,\\" or maybe NVA regulars because the field of fire was pretty concentrated like these guys had done it together for a while. In any case the fire was getting heavy and so I wasn't paying enough attention to where I was heading. Next thing I know I am in the creek, water all around and muddy, big muddy, and I can't get out, no way. I take a round in the shoulder; see that scar there, ya, that's Purple Heart territory. I guess the hit made me crazy, crazy not with pain as with fear, animal fear, and that ain't no lie. I could smell it and it wasn't pretty.<br /><br />I started crying out, started crying out like crazy \\"Zeb, don't leave me here to  die alone so far from home, please Zeb.\\"  And you know I don't have to say anything more about it because as you can see Jeb did not leave me in any 'Nam. Ya, he got the Bronze Star for that, and a Purple Heart to boot for his own wounds carrying me to the medivac area although I must have passed out because I don't remember much after the screaming and that fear smell. My war was over, and I lost a little contact with Jeb as guys will do when they get split up in wartime.<br /><br />Back in the real world and out, maybe 1972, I was doing okay, a little of this and that, nothing big and nothing that couldn't be shoved aside like air if I wanted to take off. Then about  a year later I heard through a mutual friend that Jeb had made it back to \\"the real world\\" after another tour of duty in `Nam and was out in Los Angeles. What that friend didn't tell me, or didn't know, was that second tour took the stuffing out of Zeb and he had started doing some girl. You know what that is right? Cocaine. Ya, drugs to ease the pain and erase the horror. And once girl couldn't shake the dreams and the pain then boy, plenty of boy took you out of this world. Boy, since you didn't know what girl was, is nothing but horse, heroin, sweet dreams, for a while heroin.<br /><br />Ya, Jeb was in a bad way out there in L.A. living on the streets, knocking off drug stores and I don't what else is what he told me later when he was sober a couple of times. Somehow our mutual friend gave Zeb my number and one night, one hellish stormy night up in Maine where I was staying working at a small shipyard, I got a phone call from Zeb saying, \\"Jeff, don't leave me out here alone to die, please Jeff.\\"  And you know I don't have to say anything more because I did not leave Jeb to die alone in any L.A. Jesus, no, not a good old country no shoes boy like Zeb in L.A. They would eat him alive.<br /><br />So, a few days, maybe a week later, we met in a Mission Of God house or some such place over on Wiltshire, not the good part, and I got him fixed up there for a while. He was shaky, very shaky. Then, after a few months, he decided that he had to get out of that mission house and live on the streets. Well not exactly the streets but in a place like this, near the railroad tracks, in case he wanted to head home he said, just a hobo jungle really. So I stayed with him naturally. Somehow he got some boy from god knows where and he went off to the races again. He wouldn't even consider getting help or leaving the jungle. He said he felt at home under bridges, and along railroad tracks.<br /><br />Well, somehow one day, I wasn't around that day I was down at the pier looking for a couple of days work to tide us over, he got a hold of some badass smack , some poison left-over stuff and started dancing on the tracks from what some `bo who was there said later. You know as well as I do you can't dance on any railroad track and not draw a wrong number. They say he tried to get off the track but he wasn't fast enough.<br /><br />Ya, Zeb was quite a guy in his time, a guy you could depend on if you know what I mean. I still miss the bastard and will until I leave this good green earth and that ain't no lie, no sir. Poor Jeb lived on sweet dreams and train smoke and I guess I will for a while. Maybe do a little of this and that again. But not right now, okay.

8866131385|5.0|I'm a big Moleskine user/lover - and this is my favorite by far.  There is a slight update to the 2012/2013 version: the first portion that last year had quick pages with each month of the year on a separate page (box style) - this year those same pages are listed with each day as a line, rather than a box.  Not a big difference - but just pointing out a difference.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I am a big Liam Neeson fan and was intrigued about the description of The Grey.  I was sorely disappointed.  While this movie could have provided insights in how people face death, it fell flat on its face.  The wolves were portrayed with an uncanny ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound or a very large canyon while the humans were portrayed as stupid and having absolutely no common sense at all. The scenes showing Neeson's character with his wife were unconvincing in that she was supposedly dying and yet her makeup was perfect and she looked like she could walk the runway at any minute.  With movie technology being what it is, the wolves were more cartoonish than scary and we were never really able to see them anyway.  I will not spoil for the ending for those who wish to view this movie.  But I will say that when the movie ended, I chalked it up to a bad purchase and threw it in the trash.

1594203334|5.0|I started reading the book and am about halfway through. I wish I had read and heeded the lessons mentioned in the book, because I was too busy doing attachment parenting (my son's adopted) and he has very low frustration tolerance. I was meeting all his needs as soon as possible because I found him to be such a difficult child and it was a way to keep my sanity. But in hindsight, I didn't do either of us a favor. It was only by the time he was 4 that I realized my folly, and I've been not too successfully trying to undo the damage for the last 7 years.<br /><br />So for all you new parents, or soon to be parents, I recommend this book and the subtle, but very important, ways the author talks about in order to teach your child to function well in this world.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again not one of the best books I have read but also not the worst.  I have read Fifty Shades of Grey and completed Fifty Shades Darker which I have to say was much better than book one.  It actually seemed to me the authors writing style changed a bit and there was a lot more going on in the story this time.  You began to know a little more about Christian and who he is and why.  You also get a chance to know a little more about Elena and an ex-sub - women are crazy really.  You also realize that Anna is one tough little cookie.  The second book was very good for me (but I will admit the sex got quite perennial) - the story was a good love story and I did enjoy the way it unfolded.  Again for an amateur writer well done Mrs. James.<br /><br />6/18/12<br />Edward and Bella???  I was watching the twilight series this weekend and realized that this woman stole a lot of things from Twilight - right down to the cars they drove.  I have never read the books but love the movies and own all four.  I was very disappointed in Mrs. James to say the least.  She had no original idea at all!!  This is totally Bella and Edward except sex was involved.  She really should have tried to crown her own idea and not someone elses.<br /><br />However I am reading book three Fifty Shades Freed - struggling to get through it though because it is boring as all get out.  Mrs. James writing style changed halfway through book one, then again in book two and again in book three.  Had I not already read book one and two I would put this one down but I would like to know what happens and how this story will end.  Cannot tell you much about the book because I am only about 13% into it and struggling as I stated above.  Not sure what chapter I am in but if the story does not pick up soon I am sure to put it down.  I would have liked book three to be Christian narrating - would have been nice to know his twisted thoughts.  Jeez, instead of the thoughts of a young girl who really didn't know much totell much.  Feel I wasted 10 bucks on this one.  If I get through the entire book I will be sure to write a review.

One that I enjoy is Robin Hood Man In Tights. When ever I watch Robin Hood Princes of Thieves I always think something funny is about to happen. Specially the scenes with the Sheriff and the Witch. The way they act it takes me back to the funny movie Robin Hood Man In Tights. I keep waiting for the funny lines. But it never happens. This is still a good movie.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|If you aim high - very high - you best be ready to meet expectations. The expectations for making a movie such as Prometheus are that you don't scrimp on any of the main ingredients - special effects, art direction, cinematography, music, characterisation, and plot. Ridley Scott's prequel to the Alien saga gets it right on the first three but falls short (sometimes far too much) on the latter three.<br /><br />  Scott's return to the Alien story (a 33-year distance in release dates of his two efforts) reveals how much the director has changed his craft. His eye for detail and precision in capturing science fiction worlds has evolved finely. But his meticulousness has not carried over into demanding the best in stories and its characters. Instead of making a concerted effort to make sense of characters (flesh them out, merit their inclusion in the story), and to plug holes in a film's story by rooting out problem areas/weaknesses, Scott has frustratingly let these things slide with the result of making Prometheus, arguably one of the most eagerly awaited films of all time, a needlessly flawed film.<br /><br />  The film's plot has a much loftier endeavour that Alien;that in itself is not a problem, but it may open up more pitfalls. It is basically concerned with the origins of mankind, so it can't really get much bigger. And why the pitfalls of Prometheus are frustrating is because they could have been pretty easily avoided. Whether it is because Scott is not too pushed about ensuring characterisation and plot are as best as can be achieved or whether he tried and just didn't get it right is one question, but one certainty is that the problems with the film are identifiable as being his responsibility (with slight exception of the sometimes ill-fitting score).<br /><br />  This review will not run through the plot of Prometheus or offer a summary; it will merely identify some areas.<br /><br />  The foreign world where the Prometheus story unfolds looks wonderful; ithas that giant scope that one may want from a big budget sci-fi attempt (it looks better than worlds depicted in Avatar). The CGI and other effects are spot on. It has a lush, crisp image. One can well believe it is real. They simply look good and do the business.<br /><br />  But there are too many characters in the movie; the time is too short to give them enough room to merit their inclusion and at least five or six are there just to be expendable in one scene. The secondary characters are weak; either formulaic or simply boring. The geologist is supposed to a bit whacky; he looks the part, but his dialogue is so trite and his strained relationship with the biologist doesn't work. Kate Dickie who plays the Ford character is quite a decent actress (those who've seen Red Road or the first season of Game of Thrones will agree) but she is a total misfire in this movie - again poor dialogue, which appears to delivered on an overdubbed track by the actress and sounds amateurish.<br /><br />One might be tempted to think Logan Marshall-Green is not up to the task; he doesn't seem to be a serious actor, but maybe his lines and script don't do him any favours (or maybe they should have hired his doppelganger Thomas Hardy to the job instead). Noomi Rapace is a fine actress. The more you see of her the more she grows on you. She has some intense scenes and she handles them well. Her character has some silly flaws - how a talented scientist like herself still clings to a basic and juvenile Christian belief in the wake of everything she knows - but that doesn't stick out too sorely, mainly because Rapace is that good.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is also talented but is a bit restricted in her role. If her character had better lines and one or two more scenes where we see more of who and why she is what she is it would have worked better. And why can't she run in any direction but straight on in one particular scene at the end is just silly, but that is Scott's fault not Theron's. Idris Elba does a grand job at a standard character; he throws in a few subtleties that you would not get with others. Guy Pearce looks ridiculous to be honest; they still haven't mastered the art of having an actor thoroughly act old when they appear (in this case ridiculously so) old.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is undoubtedly the star of the film; he's perfect as the disciplined and fascinated android. He throws in some nice touches here and there and he seems to be the only character the film has got just right. But a strange point of his android character, David, is that he seems to be the only one who has a patent wonder at what he sees. The others seem to just throw out \\"oh we're in the presence of our creators\\" attitude as if it's a standard days work.<br /><br />The film may be confused in its atmosphere. For example the scene where Rapace performs a procedure on herself is excellent and terrifying, worthy of any scene in Alien or landmark comparator. But that sense of terror is never really captured again, this is a real shame. In one scene where they first discover the \\"vases\\" and things start to change with nefarious undertones, Rapace has to convey this while the score repeats the main title score which is far too light (almost uplifting) for that scene. That is simply a stupid mistake to make. It is repeated at the end when Rapace delivers her `last survivor' message, she's sending out a warning while the music plays light notes.<br /><br />The \\"Engineers\\" look good (they look like giant bald Trent Reznors) and in one scene we hear what they sound like, which was suitably unnerving. But on the topic of the Engineers probably the most intriguing question of the movie is why they turned on humans? Did they regret making the human species directly, or did they create other life that evolved into humans but not according to their plan? What was it about humans that they had a problem with? And at what stage of human development did they plan to destroy mankind? These fascinating aspects (which again only Rapace seems to put forward) are not delved into. Is it likely they ever will be? Will there be a sequel to Prometheus? There could be, and it wouldn't be such a bad thing as it is fascinating territory. But if there is to be a sequel I hope Scott doesn't make it. I suspect someone like Christopher Nolan (or, impossibly, Stanley Kubrick) would handle it better.<br /><br />Finding faults aside, Prometheus is still worth the buck for reasons for aforementioned (namely its look, effects, select performances, and the odd interesting sequence) and it will still make its stamp on science fiction film. Just a shame it didn't have a stricter, more perfectionist ethos behind it.<br /><br />3/5

B0059XTUVI|2.0|Meryl Streep recently won her third Academy Award for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  While Ms. Streep is her typical fantastic self, the film itself is a bizarre let down.  It starts in around 2008 and shows Ms. Thatcher in a semi-state of dementia.  She has visions of and converses with her dead husband Denis (Jim Broadbent).  Her past life is shown through a series of flashbacks.  The film spends too much time in the present showing her as a frail old woman fighting the demons in her mind then focusing on the potential powerful situations of her being the first woman to lead a country in the Western world. Mr. Broadbent plays his character like a complete loon and you can't understand why someone like that would haunt her mind. That being said, Ms. Streep inhabits the character and transforms herself into Margaret Thatcher completely.  While you can never argue when Ms. Streep wins an award, I thought she was much better in her three most recent nominated roles for Julie & Julia, Doubt and The Devil Wears Prada.  The film is worth watching strictly to see maybe the all-time greatest actresses in an Academy Award winning turn, but not much else.

B0014VQGX4|3.0|I read mixed comments on durability. The pictures make it look sturdy, but it is quite thin plastic and I fear the 2-year-old little brother will have it broke in no time. I wouldn't suggest getting it for anyone under 5. The tires are really cheap. We have a John Deer tractor of the same size (that came with a flatbed trailer and 6 hay bales) that is a much better quality product and cost less too. By-the-way: There are no instructions in the box and THERE IS NO CRANE as the video implies!
0345529057|5.0|I started watching Game of Thrones on HBO, and wanted to read the books to see what I was missing. I am over halfway through with the first book and am really enjoying it. George R.R. Martin is an excellent writer and knows how to tell a good story. The books are really long, though. It will take awhile to get through them. The T.V. series follows the first book very well; but they did change some things. I haven't gotten to the second book yet, but I am looking forward to reading them all. If you enjoy reading fantasy books, or if you are a fan of the HBO series, then you should read these books.

B004RJMUJO|2.0|I used to love this game and so did my toddler. But then they decided to add the stupid rewards, and now the game automatically exits unless it can access the internet.  Now I can't let my daughter play unless I hover over her to make sure she doesn't buy something.  If I'm low on data for the month, can't play until I connect to WiFi.  And don't even think about playing during a flight.  Adding the rewards has killed this game for my family.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very fun game. I got it because I saw a lot of people with it and decided I would give it a try. I loved it right away. I love this game :)

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is quite the read and I am not one to fall in love easily. However I think it unjust that Ms. Flynn does not give credit where credit is due. A major plot device was previously used by Alan Ball on the late and lamented series Six Feet Under.  In fact the plot point is so similar it is impossible to believe the author did not lift it whole from the show.  Thus I have docked the read one star for borrowing just a bit more than one really should without acknowledging same.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful, well-written sci-fi that satisfies those of us who read for character as much as for story. I could barely put it down, and I gleefully let it hijack most of my weekend.
B004EPYZT4|3.0|I have been a Conan reader from the novels and comics for years now. I am a purest when it comes to how the main character is portrayed. I liked the story and the filming but I was hoping to see Conan portrayed by someone taller in stature (head and shoulders above the average person) then Jason Mamoa or in the past Arnold! Some of the sword fight scenes He(Conan)was slow and it was too obvious that he was \\"Samoan\\" and that doesn't work for who Conan is and where he is from.  I liked the telling of his past, again it was written well!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The book cover I rate it 4 out of 5 because this one compared with the previous ones has a connection with the content, but for the book I will give a 5 out of 5. In my opinion this is the best book out of the 4 of them. Everything just works together; the plot starts building up right when they are in the honeymoon. Even in this book Stephanie Myer proves how different is her vampire story from the legends because Bella gets pregnant with a vampire. Bella's life has never been more in danger of losing her life this many times compared to all the other 3 books; one of the danger is that the baby she is trying to give birth to can end her life. The crucial time is when she gets turned to a vampire and she doesn't have the time to get used with it because she has to use her abilities to fight the Volturi for her daughter.
B007WFR1MQ|5.0|I have been a Fear Factory fan since I first heard \\"Replica\\" on that first Ozzfest Live compilation album in 1996/1997. I first checked them out live in 1998 in Chicago when they opened up for Slayer and have been with them every step of the way. I am with a lot of people here when they say that \\"The Industrialist\\" reminds them a lot of the old school sound of \\"Demanufacture\\" and \\"Obsolete\\". I feel as though with this release, Fear Factory have finally found their sound again. If this would have been released back when \\"Digimortal\\" hit, I believe Fear Factory would have been one of the biggest bands in the world.<br /><br />With that being said, let's break this sucker down. I am a huge fan of concept albums so when I found out that \\"The Industrialist\\" was a full fledge concept record, I got super amped up. The opening title track is killer on its own, but I managed to pick up the special edititon with Burton's story in it, when I began to read along with his works and hit play when \\"The Industrialist\\" begins walking the streets, goose bumps hit my arm! The story, (while may contain a few holes)adds a great feel to the album and really makes it feel more special than any release they have put out since \\"Obsolete\\". After the six minute title track completed, I hit pause to continue reading the story. If you do it this way, you are in for a crazy ride. If not, no big deal. This release is really a kick ass industrial record from beginning to end.<br /><br />I have seen a few things online with people bitching about the programmed drums. To me, it is such a fitting move. I think it really beings together the whole industrial sound of the band! If you are a fan of what Fear Factory did in the 90's give this thing your attention. The one thing that I wish was included in the special edititon is a second CD where it was the album with Burton reading the story with the music played when it is meant to hit or some kind of video for the whole album.<br /><br />\\"The Industrialist\\" may take a couple of spins for you to really find the feel but this album will be getting my full on attention for years to come!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Before I purchased my kindle fire I wanted to try it out first so my sister let me borrow hers. She had this cover on hers and I totally fell in love with it because my favorite color is pink. I like how the whole kindle clicks into the cover and won't fall out. I really don't know what else I can say about it. I hope that if anyone decides to purchase it they will be as happy with it as I am with mine.
B001DHXT20|3.0|Okay this was better then the T.V. show and the last \\"Movie\\" attempt with the HULK. A good story line but as for the casting of the villain (Tim Roth) it is just not believable! It's like pitting Rocky against Woody Allen, instead of Dolf Lundgren, who is much more imposing and believable! I know your saying \\"Believable?\\" this is a comic book movie!(example; Micky Rourke in Ironman) And I have to say that William Hurt is William HURT! in this, with is bland monotone flat line performance he kills his character. So ONE STAR for the writing. ONE STAR for Ed Norton and Liv Tyler and ONE STAR for the FX's!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Wasnt what I expected after reading Book One. I like that the story turned romantic and sweet. Not as much action as first book. Slight disappointment. I like the story but it contains a lot of repetitiveness and redundancy. With that being said, I'm on to Book Three. Hope it heats up a little.
B001AZI1W8|5.0|It may not be very developed in the scenery department as her later tours, but I really love her dominatrix costumes, hair, and make-up. It suited her very well. I kept thinking of Sailor Saturn for some reason. It would have been nice if Lemme Get That was included in the setlist as well, but I'm glad she included Sell Me Candy and Question Existing.  She's a good performer. GGGB is my favorite era.
B005HSL626|5.0|I first got introduced to fruit slasher on my niece's ipod so when I purchased my kindle fire from amazon.com I knew that I had to try to find it. I am so happy that I did.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|I'm of the generation that lived the British Blues Rock phenomenon as it played out. John Mayall, who produced Clapton and Green, Yardbirds who produced Beck and Page. Modern rock royalty of the day. Bonamassa is heir to the throne and at the moment Guitar Center's and Guitar Magazine's around the world's current King of the Blues and Blues rock. Being Joe's lucky 13th album and Rolling Stone being somewhat late to the party this current album is one of Joe's strongest efforts. Although he tends to knock them out in days rather than months and every year as opposed to once in a blue moon. Putting out a quality album time after time speaks to his ability to not only right but to chose some wonderful gems to cover. Robert Johnson is much more well known as the author of Crossroads but this diamond in the rough, Stones in my Passway takes blues from the 78rpm era into the new century. Then again Bill Withers is known for Ain't no Sunshine also wrote Lonely Town Lonely Street, which Joe rocks up and culminates in a duel with B3 wizard Arlan Schierbaum. Willie Dixon known for Hochie Coochie Man was tapped as well with his I got All You Need for an old school Chicago shuffle.<br /><br />This album is a nod to the old blues men of days gone by Joe makes these songs sound like they were reinvented in the 70's the era that made me a blues fan. Then he throws in some original songs that sound like blues classics save the title song that sounds like a hit to me. Joe has always been a musician's musician. A guitar player that many now imitate and aspire to be like. He never settled for just being a guitar player. He can sing too. For those of you that are new to Joe get ready to hear much more from him and of him. He is not hype he is the real deal. He is just now reaching the fame he deserves.

B00006F7IM|5.0|Major League is one of my favorite comedy movies that I continue to watch over and over again sometimes 2-3 times a year depending on my mood.  It had the right amount of mix of comedy, drama, and so forth to make it an enjoyable movie for everyone who is watching it.<br />One of the items that made me buy the movie was Charlie getting pitch in the face, the humorous one liners from all the actors, plus seeing Charlie wearing those glasses with the skulls priceless.  Plus last the gutiar riff of Wild Thing one of my favorite riffs opening wise for a song.  So if your a fan of baseball or comedies pick this up and sit back and savor a great movie with mutiple laughs from start to finish.
B0058P4QY8|5.0|There's not much more that I can say that hasn't already been said, but this e-book is delightful! The characters, the stories, and the illustrations are just perfect.

B003Y5H54W|4.0|As soon as I saw the trailer to \\"Red Riding Hood\\" (2011) I wanted to see it. This is basically a werewolf mystery with elements of the children's tale. What sets it apart from other werewolf mysteries, like [[ASIN:6301576152 Howling V - The Rebirth [VHS]]], [[ASIN:B0007VY558 The Beast Must Die]] and [[ASIN:B003ABZGQY The Beast of Bray Road]], is that \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is set in medieval Europe, possibly France near the border of Germany (the writer of the fairy tale, Charles Perrault, was a Frenchman).<br /><br />Even people who don't like this film acknowledge the outstanding cinematography, locations, costumes and medieval sets (shot in British Columbia). But some grumble about it being a \\"Twilight\\" imitation or that the story's boring, etc. Although I'm sure the incredible success of the Twilight films contributed to the production of \\"Red Riding Hood\\" it's vastly different in tone simply by the fact that it takes place in 1300s Europe. As for the story being boring, it might not be the most compelling screenplay ever written but I was intrigued by the werewolf mystery and the film nicely created suspense concerning who might be the werewolf.<br /><br />Speaking of which, there are no less than seven suspects and I wasn't able to correctly guess, even though I pinned it down to a possible three or four. When the werewolf is finally revealed and the explanation given it all made perfect sense and there are a handful of solid clues for sleuths. Excellent job on this front.<br /><br />I was also impressed by a couple of original elements that \\"Red Riding Hood\\" brought to the table of werewolf lore. I can't share them here because I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />As far as cast goes, you have heavyweights like Gary Oldman and Julie Christie, as well as Billy Burke, Virginia Madsen and Amanda Seyfried. Amanda is great for the titular role with her big beautiful eyes.<br /><br />There are a couple of quality Goth songs on the soundtrack, including \\"The Wolf\\" by Fever Ray, which makes the relatively long celebration sequence in the village a highlight.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: More than anything else, \\"Red Riding Hood\\" struck me as a modern-day Hammer film. If you appreciate Hammer films like \\"[[ASIN:B002RPR6TE The Curse of the Werewolf]],\\" as well as movies like \\"[[ASIN:B00064LJVE The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)]]\\" and the three mentioned above, don't miss out on \\"Red Riding Hood.\\"<br /><br />The film runs 100 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Blf\\" by Fever Ray, which makes the relatively long celebration sequence in the village a highlight.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: More than anything else, \\"Red Riding Hood\\" struck me as a modern-day Hammer film.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was recommended to me so foolishly I bought it.  It reads like a high school creative writing assignment. I was very disappointed and couldn't finish reading it. There are much better books out there written by adults.  Save your money.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Act of Valor is an amazing movie! The training & teamwork needed to become a Navy Seal are unimaginable. You won't miss the famous \\"actors\\" at all. The dialogue is real just like you are having a conversation with your best friend or family. All Americans should rally around this movie & view it, as you won't be disappointed. It is action packed, tragic & will break your heart. It is also about extreme bravery, love of country, of their Seal brothers & of their families. It shows the tremendous sacrifice,strength and most of all, mental fortitude these men have. They are truly real super-heroes! This movie should receive the highest honor in the movie industry for \\"Best Picture\\". I am very thankful this movie was made as I am more appreciative than ever of these men & our entire Military. God Bless them for what they do!
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Released to theaters in March, 2012, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a post-apocalyptic film based on Suzanne Collins' popular book. A new nation, Panem, exists in North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government, which hosts the `hunger games' annually, a brutal reality show featuring 24 contestants from Panem's 12 subjugated districts. The contestants, called \\"tributes,\\" range from ages 12-18 and there can only be one winner since it's a survival fight to the death!<br /><br />The first thing that impressed me was the realistic air and overall ambiance of the film, as well as the entire dystopian concept and story set-up.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as the two \\"tributes\\" from District 12, Katniss and Peeta, are quality protagonists and I like the ambiguity of their feelings - are they for real or for show.<br /><br />Lenny Kravitz stands out as one of the few caring characters from the Capitol, while Woody Harrelson is effective as the drunken advisor to the tributes, a past victor of the hunger games. Also on hand are Elizabeth banks, as the creepy but sorta winsome host of the District 12 tributes; Donald Sutherland as Panem's dictatorial president; and Wes Bentley as his right-hand man with a beard Satan himself would covet.<br /><br />For me, the weak point of the film is the long third act, which constitutes the hunger games themselves, a fight-to-the-death in the forested wilderness (shot in the mountains of Western North Carolina). I anticipated this to be the best part, especially since I love survival stories and the wilderness, but it just wasn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been. At the same time, it wasn't bad. The additions of the dubious \\"mockingjay\\" sequence and artificial horror-dogs who for some strange reason can't overtake the protagonists mar the film.<br /><br />I thought the name of the nation -- Panem -- was really strange, until I discovered that `Panem' means \\"bread\\" in Latin, as in the popular phrase \\"bread and circuses\\" (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses. In the film, President Snow said something to this effect to Seneca Crane (Bentley). On top of this, the film shows flashbacks of Peeta intentionally burning literal bread and throwing it to the starving Katniss, which saves her. The bread motif appears elsewhere as well:<br />as a parachute offering to Katniss from District 11 to show her their gratitude for her kindness to Rue (Amandla Stenberg) and the bread parachutes given to the tributes that communicated covert information.<br /><br />I was a bit bewildered by the ending, since it left some things up in the air, but I suppose it leaves room for sequels.<br /><br />When the credits began to role a song came on that just blew my mind; my wife motioned to leave, but I couldn't leave my chair while this awe-inspiring tune played. It's \\"Abraham's Daughter\\" by Arcade Fire, an incredible piece. Check it out on youtube.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: If the long third act were better I wouldn't hesitate to give \\"The Hunger Games\\" an A-level rating. As it is, it's a good dystopian adventure with some excellent aspects, like the entire set-up, the protagonists and closing song.<br /><br />The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Bnem' means \\"bread\\" in Latin, as in the popular phrase \\"bread and circuses\\" (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses.

Installing and using gReader was simple, and it stays synched between what I have read on my Fire and what I have read on the web.  In short, it simply works.<br /><br />Also, I love the \\"readability\\" feature that strips out the web formatting when I am reading an article making the article much easier to read on hand held devices.  My only complaint is that at least on some sites, the \\"R\\" icon is right over a placed advertisement, and thus I sometimes accidentally click on the ad instead of the \\"R\\".

B0076R62FM|4.0|\\"Reborn\\" fits the title quite nicely as the beginning of the movie explains how Johnny English has been refueling himself for another mission. Rowan Atkinson is a funny guy and you either like him a whole lot or not at all. I'm a big fan so that made the movie all the more enjoyable. The plot was written well enough to have a serious note to it, so you were cheering for Johnny English all the way. Worth the rental price and I wouldn't have been disappointed to pay for theater tickets.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|As I read most of the customer reviews on this site, I see now more than ever that American culture is completely lost. For so many people to trash a monumentally important work of art makes me want to vomit. This sort of ignorance goes beyond subjectivity. Even if you fail to \\"get\\" the film on the most basic level, you simply cannot go on to say that it is \\"stupid\\", \\"pointless\\", \\"pretentious\\", or, my personal favorite, \\"boring\\".<br /><br />This culture is entirely spoiled. We've lost our sense of wonder and mystery. We have to have everything \\"now\\". We need our action \\"now\\". We need explosions, we need CGI, we need a very specific, meticulously spoon-fed \\"plot\\" to move us along. We cannot think for ourselves. We do not value ambiguity. We do not appreciate slow-pacing, and we don't want to \\"experience\\" film. We do not want film to become an extension of the soul. 'Tree of Life' is exactly that. It is the most important film to come along in decades, yet people will condemn it, while they toss accolades to the likes of 'Iron Man' and 'Twilight'. We live in a stupid culture in stupid times, with people that value stupidity instead of substance.<br /><br />The 'one star' voters need to know that they are simply lazy and nothing more. I'm sorry if this film requires a little more brain activity than most, but this does not make the film worthless. It just makes you sad. I'm sorry the rest of you have missed out on something beautiful.<br /><br />Then again, most of you wouldn't know beauty if it kicked you in the ass. Ungrateful morons.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever i used to have this as a third party app before it even came to the market for kindle fire. very addicting.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|What makes a bad album? The question kept repeating as I listened to the new Neil Young & Crazy Horse CD.  Bad albums aren't made by bands or artists that you don't listen to or whose product you would never buy in the first place. By my definition, I simply have no right to call their albums \\"bad\\".  A bad album happens when an artist that you revere, that you have followed from the beginning or who you come to later and devour their entire body of work, puts out something so shockingly awful that even the notion that the artist was \\"pushing boundaries\\" just doesn't fly.  A truly bad album goes beyond the question \\"what was he/she/they thinking?\\"  It is instantly comical, bordering on parody. It's not, however, unlistenable.  On the contrary, you probably play it more than you even realize, especially for friends - \\"Wait to you hear this drivel!!\\"<br /><br />Some of my heroes have written bad songs.  Don't you think that Springsteen wrote \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" on a bet or as part of an inside joke?  Some have had the weekend binge of \\"creativity\\" and ventured out for a (hopefully) one time release.  (Have you put your Lou Reed/Metallica LuLu CD on recently?  Are you really looking forward to the next Eddie Vedder ukulele album?)  But a whole album of WTF from one of the gods? At first, this was my reaction to the Dylan Christmas CD.  But, because it was so bad, I played it incessantly.  It soon brought shrieks of laughter and playful moans of \\"Not again!\\" It's now become a holiday staple.<br /><br />The new Neil Young & Crazy Horse CD, however, defies any attempt to define a bad album.  This thing is so freaking awful that five stars are just not enough to register my glee as I make plans to spring this monstrosity on future unsuspecting listening audiences.  Songs your parents learned, that we learned and that we taught our children - done Crazy Horse style!  BUT, with all new arrangements!  (Does anyone else thing that the opener - Oh Susannah - sounds just like \\"I'm Your Venus\\", Bananarama style?)  My personal fave, however, is that centuries old folk standard - Get A Job.  Now that's Americana, and a perfect fit in the sequence of other cornerstones of American folklore - Gallows Pole [Finland?] and God Save The Queen [uh, the UK?].<br /><br />All I can say is pluck down the 10 spot and buy it.  You'll laugh your ass off for at least an hour and maybe you can use it to goof on your friends and neighbors around the fire pit. I can't wait for the tour.  Just hope I can get my hands on some of whatever it is that Neil has been smoking.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|First of all, I am convinced, I truly believe that body weight exercises are the way to go, and I think it is fabulous that the author can prove his conclusions with fact. Secondly, the inclusion of the diet section was a brilliant addition that succeeded in making this book a complete guide to fitness.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I purchased this item and wasnt expecting it to be in such fantastic condition, it was brand new minus the wrapper, and for the $12.00 plus shipping it was a true steal, the seller can hold there heads high !  the product itself is a great tv series that has a  \\"space cowboy\\" theme to it, i realy like it and am amazed it didnt get more years.. but this series with confidence, its great show, buy from this seller with confidence, great product with lightning shipping.<br />I finished watching this series today, Man -o-Man whoever decided this only got one season needs fired..  what a total waste of a fantastic story line..  very sad, by mid season i was realy hooked and on the last episode i was sad, im rewatching the movie \\"Serenity\\" just for effect now.. waht a great talentd cast and a great show, they should have continued it.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Easy to use and to buy stuff buy all the time from here.... lil bit hard to install on some devices.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I am blown away for the new beach boys new album! Every song on this cd is awesome! Honestly to me this the best album since pet sounds! Just do me a favor just buy the cd! You wont be dissapointed! : )
B001CDZZI6|3.0|While I cannot say that I am completely sold on the author's point of view. The authors do indeed have a lot of proof to back up what they are saying, and buying the book, gives you hassle free access to their online survey. My only caveat is that beyond the one good idea that the book had, it seemed like there might have been a little too much filler material afterword, but an interesting read nonetheless.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I came across this movies title while reviewing another movie, im amazed that i had never heard of this movie, or the series on tv.  Well, i was told you could watch and enjoy the movie without watching the series, so i ordered Serenity and can say it was a real treat, im not a sci-fi nut, im actually more into period films.. But Serenity was such a great story line i decided to order the seroies  \\"Firefly\\" so i can get the full picture.  This movie was obviously low budget but the story line was just fantastic, i wish there was a bigger budget so this movie could have gottent he treatment it deserved.
B0088TG252|5.0|If non-stop action is what you want, this is it. Like \\"Salt\\" easily can watch it again and again. Plot? Rather simple actually: Washington has something that a mysterious, all knowing, enemy, wants and the chase begins. Certainly a man-type person movie and probably not a date movie unless your GF, wife, likes action. A few 4-letter words but not that many and although plenty of gunfire, blood does not spurt everywhere. Liked all major characters. Recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written, entertaining and erotic. A great book to suggest to your girlfriends and awaken your inner goddess. Ended up reading the trilogy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the entire series. Good story line and kept me interested the whole time. As soon as I finished this book I bought Mockingjay. Well worth it!
B007MDB71O|4.0|I loved this movie and would rate 5 stars, except Disney's \\"Combo Packs\\" are complete BS. I enjoy extra features on films, and Disney did not see fit to put ANY on their DVD release of the movie. For that reason, I shelled out the extra cash for the \\"Combo Pack\\" which promised these features. Only after I received the film did I find out that the ONLY feature on the DVD is the documentary. ALL other features, including popular ones like Bloopers and Deleted Scenes are ONLY on the BluRay disc.<br /><br />I have absolutely NO WAY to see these features. WHAT IS THE POINT? Why would someone want another disc in a format they do not use? I paid extra money for content that I have no access to. It's a complete scam. ONLY buy this disc if you watch movies in BluRay. Use the DVD for a coaster, I guess.
B000ZHS3E8|4.0|Nice film I never heard of. Like premise, special effects, actors/characters. Would recommend for SYFY fans. Action, sort of. Did have a problem with one specific bad-guy character but other than that. Worth a look. Not a date movie unless GF, wife, into SYFY. Recommend.

014241722X|2.0|I have recently become addicted to Grisham having given him up for lost for a number of years. I should not have picked up this read. Boooorrrrriiingg. Couldn't deal with it. I will not dump Grisham. I think his more recent novels have had fascinating plots and I recommend avid readers to check some of his other books but you could skip this one.  Tom Roe

B005LAIGSC|2.0|What??? No director's commentary or audio commentary of any kind? That makes this a rental not a purchase. C'mon, Universal!
B007R9MFPU|4.0|Admittedly, I sort of gave up on Ultravox after \\"Vienna\\", being a much bigger fan of the darker, harder John Foxx era of the band. But after checking this latest out, their first with this classic line-up in three decades, I must say I like it better than anything they EVER did with Midge Ure. 'Retro' , not 'retread' is pretty much the key here. Big synths, lots of soaring melodies and choruses, and enough instrumental creativity to make their early material seem quite basic, this is a newer nu-wave for the 21st century edition of this band, one that trades in those early thin-sounding keyboards and tinny drums for a big, fat modern production. Surprisingly, the British press reviews of this album have been pretty negative, so you KNOW it's gotta be good. They didn't 'get' them then, and they still don't.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|once i picked it up i couldnt put it down.<br /><br />i usually like my fantasy books filled with magic but after reading i was quite pleased by the lack of mystical events ( though there were some )as it was replaced by a truly nail biting experience.<br /><br />looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />five stars all the way
B0061S073A|4.0|overall this app keeps my 3 year old away from apps he cant use. he has managed to bypass kids place if he clicks an icon before kids place comes back on.
0307730697|5.0|Want an inspiring and heartwarming story about the power of redemption? This is it. Blehm's masterpiece takes you through the entire life of Adam Brown, who fits the title of this book to a perfect \\"T\\". Just don't read it without some Kleenex handy.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I purchased these back in February but not on Amazon due to better price at the time from BH Photo, but purchase was made due to reviews here. I buy a lot of stuffs on Amazon and love this company due to quick and timely delivery with reasonable prices. I love these headphones they sound so clean and you hear sounds you normally don't on other headsets and I got a package deal that came with Pearlstone pads that I have just in case original wears out but original still going strong and shows no wear and tear or the hint of coming off. You hear music how the producers intended you to hear it with no artificial sound just clean accurate sound, no extra bass just clean bass you can off course from another source adjust sound to your liking but I prefer flat clean sound. Now you must wonder then why just 4 stars? Well because now since I purchased these and saw the reviews about the much heated debate of these 7506 vs Sony MDR V6 I had to get one also. I must say after reading and seeing that a lot of people could not tell the difference I had to give it a try since now the Sony V6 has gotten cheaper again that the V6 does sound better due to a cleaner and livelier bass. Yes the V6 does get 5 stars and don't get me wrong these 7506 are excellent and I'm sure a lot of people may prefer the 7506 over the V6 but for me I got to go with the V6 and I bought these 7506 first due to in February the V6 was out of stock everywhere and if it was available the lowest price at the time was $199 and as high as $299 but now that Sony has caught up with production the V6 is back and as low as $75 here on Amazon where as I got mine from Sony (with discount) a little lower. So with the prices for both as cheap as they come and how good they sound just buy both and they still cheaper than Bose or Beats.
0345803485|1.0|I received the Nook as a gift back in December of 2011 and had downloaded this book. I read two chapters and gave up on it becuase it is just very slow and drawn out and well - boring.  Then all the hype of this book esculated and I thought hmmm - let me give this a try one more time. Well I read it and its not shocking or anything so \\"erotic\\" that would make me blush. Ana's character is so fake and unbelievable and the big billionaire so what. He has a room full of toys or a dungeon. Please. Just not believeable at all and I just kept shaking my head over and over. The whole \\"biting of her lip\\" is turning me on stuff was the stuff a 16 year old might write. I will NOT be continuing this series.
B0086700CM|4.0|thcs game is a lot better on my iphone 4s you can run better and you don't get problems all the time,  but other than that it is ok
B003D5X3VM|4.0|This artist has a very smooth strong baritone voice. Not much range, but distinctive. Almost all songs are originals. The solos by some musicians leave a little work. But, as a whole the album is very good.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game I love it so much and I am addicted to it my parents get mad when I get into it!
B001EYGOEM|4.0|You maybe be surprised to be seeing a review of this from me because i really dont like country. But, taylor is different!<br /><br />I got this cd from my sister because she got the platinum edition of this! I really do like this! Some songs like \\"You Belong With Me\\" and \\"Love Story\\" I kind of sick of hearing but the rest are nice.<br /><br />I think, because i have liked it for a long time, my favorite track is \\"Forever & Always\\". I think every Taylor knows that this song was written about her breakup with Joe jonas. Which by the way was like a 15 sec phone call. w0w.<br /><br />This cd also has enhanced content that has the videos for \\"Love Story\\" and \\"Change\\", which in my opinion is a pretty nice BONUS!<br /><br />I think that is really all i have to say about it! I think if you are a pop or country fan, you will enjoy this!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|They're known as \\"America's Band\\" for a reason: No other American rock band has more top-40 hits than The Beach Boys. They stormed the charts in the early-mid 60s with songs of surf, cars, and love. Now, 50 years later they're back to fill our stereo systems with more beautiful harmonies.<br /><br />After YEARS of lawsuits, stagnant solo efforts, and John Stamos (cringe) the REAL Beach Boys are back to give their fans one last treat. Of course, we're missing Carl and Dennis Wilson on this album, but the guys and Jeff Foskett do a great job in picking up the slack. Listening to the opening harmonies of 'Think About The Days' the listener starts to realize that this isn't a half-hearted attempt at making some easy money (like most reunion albums are). A few seconds into the title song the listener realizes that this album could possibly rank among their greater works.<br /><br />'Isn't It Time' is exactly how a 2012 Beach Boys song should sound: It's got great harmonies, good lyrics, and the vocals from these guys are incredible! 'Spring Vacation' is a nostalgic piece that blends Mike's summertime lyrical-style with Brian's keen ear for harmonies and chords. The Private Life of Bill and Sue, Shelter, Daybreak Over The Ocean each have their own unique personality, yet they all have that trademark Beach Boy sound.<br /><br />Ok, so there are some clunkers on this album....first off is the biggest sore thumb: Beaches in Mind. Words can't describe how awful this song is, so I'm not going to try....just listen to it, then you'll understand what I mean. Strange World is another that I found to be a bit of a letdown. It sounds unfinished in instrumentation and unimagined in lyrical content. It seems that a lot of people like this song, you may too, but this is just my opinion.<br /><br />'From There To Back Again': Now is where the album become's a chord-progressing, tempo-changing, tear-jerking performance. This song is the start of a three-song suite that subtly tells the listener that The Beach Boys, like all things, will soon be going away. Al Jardine sounds like he hasn't aged a day since recording 'Help Me Rhonda'. 'Pacific Coast Highway' is one of the greatest Beach Boy songs I have ever heard. Period. 'Summer's Gone' has some of the best Brian Wilson vocals I've heard since the late 60s. The end of this album will seriously tug at your emotions.<br /><br />Overall, this album is their best since 'Sunflower'. It has got AMAZING vocals, the song-writing is very thought out, each song is unique. I want to say THANK YOU to the Beach Boys for making one last effort at an album: it paid off immensely. And if you decide to record another album, I don't blame you. You guys still have what it takes to get to the top of the charts and it shows.<br /><br />5/5listener that The Beach Boys, like all things, will soon be going away.

0375842209|5.0|This book has been on my must reads for a while. My friends 14 year old daughter read it and gave it to me. WOW!! I called her after I finished it, and we talked about the book.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am enjoying the book as much as Fifty Shades of Grey.. Keeps you interested and my kindle on.  Can hardly wait for book 3.....
B007V80WUC|3.0|As of now, this review should only be taken as a \\"first impression.\\"  After a couple weeks to a month, I may update my review.  Also, I would say that my rating would be about a 3.5.<br /><br />A little history:<br />I stumbled upon CM in Mid 2010...Luckily I have not been waiting as long as some of the other CM fans.  Since then, much of the first two albums have made it into my daily playlists.  I rate all my music.  6 songs of the first two albums have a 5/5 with much of the others with 4/5.<br /><br />On to the review:<br />On Nine, I have 7 songs rated at 4/5 though I am still evaluating the songs.  I expect none of the songs will be rated at 5/5 when the dust clears.  The quality of the recording is excellent, and even on the songs that I have rated at 3/5, the musicianship is excellent.<br /><br />The biggest problems I find fall in the areas of word choice, phrasing, and fluid musical transitions. For examples of word choice issues/phrasing listen to \\"Burn after Reading\\" about 3 minutes in started with \\"I should...\\" For an example of a transition issue, \\"Namaste\\" has an abrupt musical change at 2:24.  The transition isn't terrible but the first couple of times I listened to it, I thought I was listening to a subsequent track on the album.  \\"The 1st Chapter\\" from The [[ASIN:B0009ML238 First Chapter]] in comparison has multiple movements throughout the song which are done in a way that makes you believe that the changes are meant to be there even when abrupt.<br /><br />That being said, I can't find any \\"bad\\" songs on the album.  Overall Nine is decent.<br /><br />The album has more of a pop influence (like \\"Abyss\\" and \\"Arrival of Love\\" from Isolate).  There are progressive sections, but it has been toned down a bit.  If you're looking for another \\"Sane No More\\" you won't find it on the album...although you will get doses of progressiveness throughout.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you like the other CM albums, you will like this one as well, but don't expect to be wowed as you have been previously.  You won't regret buying it.<br /><br />If you are looking fore a new awesome progressive metal band, Circus Maximus is a great one to add to your library...but you might check out The [[ASIN:B0009ML238 First Chapter]] and [[ASIN:B000TNJIFG Isolate]] first.t to be wowed as you have been previously.  You won't regret buying it.<br /><br />If you are looking fore a new awesome progressive metal band, Circus Maximus is a great one to add to your library...but you might check out The [[ASIN:B0009ML238 First Chapter]] and [[ASIN:B000TNJIFG Isolate]] first.

B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book could help people be aware and to reach out to someone, and show that person, people really do care.I think this should be a requirement for pre-teens to read, and its a compelling read, that teenagers would actually like to read. It's so easy to identify with this. I have a twelve year old and a fourteen year old, and I am going to make sure they read this book, or I will read it to them. I am so amazed, and I would love to meet this author! He is an amazing man, to have so much wisdome and knowledge
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Having read the first four books in this series, I was anxious to continue the adventure with my favorite characters.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|Have you read the bible cover-to-cover? It feels a bit like reading AFFC - there're are just times when this begins to read as so many begats. This ship begat that house, that house begat that son...I find myself skimming through lengthy passages of banner descriptions & houses & their heroes, because honestly, even if ser so-and-so will become important later, I won't remember him until his chapters come. And come I'm sure they will. Or, we'll just abruptly find out he's been beheaded and his head is tarred and awaiting further inspection.<br /><br />He may've lost me on this one. I devoured the first three, I fretted over certain characters, I bemoaned their grim circumstances and I would say I'm as invested as any reader could be, but I'm not buying the next one, I don't think.  I'll catch up when HBO boils it back down to a bit more meat and less Genesis-flavored-potatoes.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|As an unabashed Joe fan for over 40 years, I'm not going to be overly analytical nor pretend to be objective. As a fan who's waited 20 years for new Joe, I'm liking what I'm hearing...unique, new approaches from a 64 yo who's been around the world a couple times.<br /><br />1) Analog Man is lyrically typical Joe. A commentary on society with a nice jam. Turn off the tube, get off yer butt and do something else. Maybe listen to a nice new CD.<br /><br />2) Wrecking Ball is from a point-of-view from some who's been there. Put down the paraphenalia and get some sleep, you're wasting your time.<br /><br />3) Lucky That Way is more country than I've heard Joe do before, but fits. We're lucky too.<br /><br />4) Spanish Dancer has a great middle, need a few more listens to appreciate this fully.<br /><br />5) Band Played On is Joe's rebuke of society attitudes. He has done environmental awareness songs for a long time, too bad he still needs to. A really rockn' tune, his bro-in-law does a nice job too.<br /><br />6) Family spreads open his heart for all to witness. Very touching revelations that it's never too late for love and acceptance to come into your life. Crosby n Nash are beautiful back-ups.<br /><br />7) One Day At A Time could reach a lot of people who need to change the direction of their life. JW agains bears his soul to offer help from someone who's been there.<br /><br />8) Hi-Roller Baby sounds like a Beach Boys tribute, not my fav so far, but again some great riffs bring the right attitude.<br /><br />9) Funk 50, loved the other 2, the only thing wrong with this is the length...\\"Show everybody I'm back\\" indeed.<br /><br />10) India is Joe's club music interpretation and it flat out jams. Whodathunk he'd be into dance mixes. Really like this one a lot.<br /><br />11) Fishbone funks up his wife's blues over a bone stuck her throat...find inspiration wherever it come from, bluesiest song on the CD. Great effects and guitar.<br /><br />12)But I Try features anold JG song with Little Richard. Wouldn't have known it was LIttle, his voice sounds different. A return to jam band days, with some individuals who know how to do it. This is growing on me.<br /><br />There's nobody lyrically or guitar-wise quite like Joe AND IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG LONELY TIME SINCE THERE WAS NEW STUFF, don't care if it's over-compressed or any other technical bs, I'm just glad there's new JOE.

B007SGM084|5.0|While EL James uses the same phrases so often, I could easily memorize sections of the books, it was such a fun read.  Book One offers mostly character development, while books two and three offer a plot that rivals that of James Patterson.  The adventures that befall Christian and Ana are more drama than is real, but it only adds to the guilty pleasures one gets of reading a good trashy novel when one should be vacuuming or completing paperwork for a deadline.  As a mom of two young children, this exciting read has enhanced my intimacy with my husband, so he didn't complain about all the time I spent with my nose to my Kindle.  Additionally, I'm a breastfeeding mom, and i have to pump in a closet at work.  Reading while pumping actually made me look forward to being locked in a closet three times a day.  Now that the books are done, I miss Christian Grey!  What will EL James write next?

B007U1FEJE|4.0|Hey...I am the BIGGEST Beach Boys/Brian Wilson fan...even apologist to some of my friends that just don't GET it..(although that circle is dwindling). I am on my 4th listen of the new album. The first 8 cuts are wonderful, but predictable to a certain extent. The harmonies are almost TOO good (is that possible??). It's hard to believe these guys are 70 (although Al Jardine is youngest as 62.) No doubt buttressed by the likes of Jeff Foskett, who now carries the load on the super high falsettos...but hey...he is not a spring chicken either at 56..still, the first few songs (and actually the majority of the leads) are performed by Brian Wilson...is it possible his voice, while not at Pet Sounds quality...is BETTER than his solo attempts starting in the late 80's?? And, wisely, he continues his career long practice of overdubbing his own vocals for that beautiful fuller sound,,,,<br /><br />I won't do a cut by cut review...suffice to say...the CD starts with an a beautiful \\"Our Prayer\\" type falsetto sweet intro..but with a hauntingly beautiful piano...then it gets to nice catchy tunes (with harmonies that are so lush I almost have to say...maybe TOO much?? Guys we know you are the best vocalists in Rock n Roll history..stop trying to prove it...??), that have the \\"Do It Again\\" theme...so much so that to quote another critic..it's like \\"Do it Again..AGAIN!!\\"....but still, beautiful music.<br /><br />Just when you are about to say....\\"nice effort..certainly worth what little money I paid..\\" the last 4 cuts HIT YOU.....WOW....I cannot even explain what fricking GREAT these tunes are...not just the music but the bittersweet lyrics. Pure Brian Wilson genius.<br /><br />For those who enjoy Beach Boys music but have been disengaged...remind yourself at just how WONDERFUL these guys are...and for those who only know them from a few 60's oldies and Kokomo.....get to know what you've been missing...
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is an tremendous tribute to our nation's best....a group of warriors whose valor and commitment to cause is celebrated and revered. Usual adjectives seem pale when you know these are \\"the real deal\\". I appreciated the attention to detail not only from the action on the mission, but to show they are fathers and husbands who put their lives on the line every day. A range of emotions were present during the movie from tears to heart pounding fears.  These guys are an extraordinary group who work like a well oiled machine. This DVD is a must for anyone who loves military action.  I am honored to include it in my DVD collection.

1416583432|2.0|The history of the domestication of the dog and some of the science behind the studies of dog behavior was interesting.  I did not find the information useful for my relationship with my dog, though.  The book was recommended by a friend with a warning that it was a dry read. There is a lot of academics and some \\"blurbs\\" of interesting information. I kept putting the book down and found it hard to pick back up again. I eventually just started skimming through the chapters and only reading the small extracts that caught my attention. It was not engaging and read like a text book. I would only be able to recommend this book as part of research rather then dog ownership or training.

It's easy to understand and most importantly -- it's easy to follow (for life!). AND it works. I've been following the starch solution for 4 years with incredible results.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|You never get bored listening to Neil. Every album is different and that keeps him relevant and fresh. Sure some albums don't always work 100% of the time but you always find something interesting on them.<br /><br />Said to be the first of two new albums with Crazy Horse, Americana is an inspired rendition of early American folk and protest songs and a revisit of Neil's musical beginings in the early 1960's, when many of these songs were first played by him. In fact the band is joined by Steven Stills on High Flying Bird, a song Stills was playing when he and Neil first met.<br /><br />Musically, the album recalls Ragged Glory another great Crazy Horse album and does not contain a weak track. I must admit I did approach the album with some caution, after reading the initial reports of a \\"folk\\" record, but it works - even God Save The Queen (My Country 'tis Of Thee), that for some reason I cannot seem to get out of my head,it is a great song. The children's choir fits nicely and Crazy Horse adds some bite to this very good collection of Murder Ballads,Folk,Doo Wop and Gospel songs.You will have heard these songs previously, but never as presented here in these different and intriguing arrangements.<br /><br />Similarly the lyrics used are not the sanitised 1950's folk era versions,rather the original versions e.g Clementine- whith the dark whole story told following Clementine's drowning. Woody Gutherie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" has the added verses refering to the depression era soup lines (the question raised - is this really these unfortunate people's Land?),the reference to signs saying this Land is NOT your land and Woody's belief that in fact it was his and your land. Many of these songs were originally protest songs and these interpretations bring back the songwriters real meaning rather than just catchy little folk tunes. The CD booklet provides notes on the songs origins and whilst I knew the story behind some most were previously unknown to me.Coming 'round The Mountain (Jesus' Chariot) for instance was a real revelation.<br /><br />This recording is great reinterpretation and revisit to songs we have come to take for granted.
0345803485|1.0|I have the erotic addition of magnetic poetry on my fridge. I also have two cats who enjoy knocking the magnates off the fridge and onto the floor. The random erotic phrases I often find on the floor have more depth, creativity, and are more interesting than this joke of a book. This is coming from someone who enjoyed the Twilight series. When done well, erotic fiction is wonderful. Who is responsible for publishing and marketing this best selling piece of \\"literature\\"? Maybe they can help my cats get a book deal.
B0086700CM|3.0|The game is absolutely awesome, addicting and fun to play to pass time. But, the lag is horrible, and the longer I've had it on my phone, the worse it gets. It crashes randomly in the middle of my game, doesn't respond to certain swipes, or reaponds wrongly to others. It's fun, but the issues it has makes it annoying to play.
0062073281|5.0|A quick, fun read. Characters to love and, more importantly, love to hate. Similar to L.A. Candy series in a warm, welcoming kind of way, like coming home for summer. Very enjoyable but ended thinking, \\"Damn you Lauren Conrad!\\" Completely, left me hanging. Cannot wait for the next book set to come out in November.

0307346617|5.0|Slightly unsettling...could this happen?  lol Ok,no. Written as a series of interviews in a very conversational tone.  As I read these vignettes I felt I could have met these people in real life.  People (and governments) that screw up and get it together, suffer and recover.  I began to wonder if I would be a survivor, should I get a crank radio and how big are my kitchen knives?!!  Incredibly entertaining!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|A great read, once I read the Fifty Shades of Grey could not wait to get into the other two books.<br />It was such an enjoyable series I was disappointed when it came to an end and would love EL James to bring out another book of Ana and Christian as lovers throughout the trials and tribulations of parenthood<br />Have now recommended the series to family and friends and<br />would suggest if you want a good read then it is a must
B0054S6N04|1.0|I'm a huge Linda Howard fan but her writing style has slowly been taking a turn for the worse. I purchased this book based on the good reviews I saw on amazon...I also read a few of the negative ones but I figured how bad could it be??? Let me tell you, there was nothing perfect about this book. Some have described it as being funny and witty, but honestly, I found nothing that even brought a chuckle to my lips. Jaine and Sam were bland IMO. There was minimal character development and very little romance between the two characters...to say there was no steam between the two was an understatement!! After reading the book, I still can't describe what Jaine looks like! Also I do agree with other reviewers who said that the \\"List\\" was ludicrous and not worthy of the public attention it received. Take my advice and skip this one folks!!

0596522347|5.0|Slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations is a book about communication. More importantly is a guide to communicating well while using presentation software as a visual aid. The book is not a how-to manual for using presentation software. It is a book about creating ideas and accompanying visuals in a way that enhances the story you trying to communicate.<br /><br />I found this book to be an enjoyable read that held my attention and inspired me to think about connecting with my audience. Thinking visually while trying to express an idea is not something that comes naturally to everyone. It is a skill that can be developed, over time, with enough practice and some mentoring. Slide:ology will help you understand the theory of using visuals to enhance your ideas while communicating with your audience.<br /><br />The book addresses design principles that should improve your ability to create meaningful presentations. Advice on thinking like a designer is paired with tips on how to maintain continuity and flow as your presentation progresses. Designers understand light, perspective, and the subliminal nuances that can put an audience at ease or make them feel anxious. Learning how to use these qualities to your advantage could be the difference between communicating your ideas effectively or failing to connect with your audience. Slide:ology takes the reader on a journey through good presentation design and leaves them better off for having traveled the path.<br /><br />I found this book to be useful and enjoyable and would recommend it to others.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free e-book copy for review purposes.
B007MDB71O|5.0|OK, you can read a couple of hundred reviews here about how the movie was unjustly overlooked, how it lost Disney millions of dollars at the box office, etc.  All true.  But I just want to comment on how fantastic the film looks on Blu-ray hi-def.  John Carter is that rare film which combines an intelligent and entertaining story with state-of-the-art visual effects.  Truly, it is a feast for the eyes.  If you're among those movie lovers who is still holding out on upgrading to Blu-ray, this is the movie that should convince you.<br /><br />The bonus features are also plentiful--which I found a pleasant surprise, given the lukewarm box-office performance--and really do a lot to enhance one's enjoyment of the film.  There's a feature on adapting E.R. Burroughs' original stories to the screen, and John Carter's \\"journal,\\" which can be viewed simultaneously with the film.  There are even some amusing \\"Barsoom Bloopers\\" and a featurette on the amazing special effects.<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" should have been the Star Wars of a new generation.  And by the way, when I say \\"Star Wars\\" I'm talking about the original 1977 film.  Watching JC in the theater, I really felt the way I did watching George Lucas's original flight of space fantasy way back when.  I'm happy to report the movie loses almost none of its splendor on the home screen.  But again, Blu-ray is an absolute must to savor every pixel of the fantastic world of Barsoom.  Buy it!

159514188X|5.0|Jay Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why is a book about Clay a boy that receives tapes from a girl, Hannah (his classmate and crush), who commited suicide two weeks ago. Hannah recorded the tapes to tell the reasons why she chose to commit suicide, and Clay is told he is one of those reasons so he follows along, using Hannah's voice as a guide to discover the unknown.<br /><br />At first I was sketchy about reading on a topic so sad and depressing, but as I read I couldn't put the book down and I felt that Jay Asher did a really good job with the plot of the story, the set-up, and all the detailing to make this book a success. I really like the set-up because it was from the two points of view and as Clay listened to what Hannah had to say, he analyzed it and you could see what both of them were feeling. This was an easy to follow book, and it brought light to a recurring problem, which I think is important for authors to do.<br /><br />I feel that the author definitely got his message across, which was to make people think about how they treat others. When I finished the book, my reaction was \\"Whoa.\\", because I thought how crazy it was for her to move to this new town, and make this decision based on how (people she just met that year) treated her. I thought that there had to be more behind what she had told, but then I rethought and said to myself, \\"Well, you never know how people take things, even if they shrug it off, you don't know what they're thinking, what they're going through and the impact that just the simplest thing can have on them.\\"<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is old enough and can handle a topic that's very strong and controversial like this one. It's a very good read and I think that it deserves the five stars that I gave it. One of the best suspense novels to date for young adults. So, kudos to Asher for having such a successful first novel.<br /><br />\\"If you want a good read, this book will satisfy your need. Guaranteed. :)\\"

B006CHML4I|4.0|This is a perfect intro to timepieces for a child - it's cheap, durable, and they can see the watch movement.    Pros:  Keeps good time  Excellent case quality  Display back  Great visibility in day or night  Day / Date indication  Mechanical movement  Looks as sharp as a casual watch can look    Cons:  At this price, the watch is disposable  Doesn't have a NATO strap - lose a springbar, lose the watch... of course you can just buy another one for the cost of a strap, so no big deal.  Poor quality Malaysian movement instead of the Japanese movement in the higher-end Seiko watches    Very noisy - even noisier than the Valjoux 7750 that I have in my Omega Speedmaster!    Distinctly lower grade than the Japanese Seiko movements... compares unfavorably to the Seiko World Time [...]    As I was writing the review, I changed my star rating from 2 to 4... it all depends on how you expect to use it.  For me, in my collection, this watch is nearly worthless.  For a child's first \\"real\\" watch, I don't think you could do any better.
1595141715|1.0|This book was an insightful look at suicidal thoughts and how one little action or phrase could affect somebody's entire life. But I did not think the story was completely fair or realistic. I had trouble figuring out what kind of person Hannah truly was-did she want people to feel guilty for her death? Or was she hoping they change the way they act? I felt like she was blaming others. Her character wasn't written that well-she never truly came to terms with herself. Blaming others for her depressed state is the easy way out. Not that suicide is an easy way out, but the characters should have been developed more.<br /><br />Also I felt like \\"listening\\" to these tapes through Clay's ears was unfair-Hannah says she doesn't blame him. That was too...simple. Since Clay didn't do anything on purpose, I don't think he reacted the same way Alex or Justin or Mr. Porter may have. Asher should have written it from the pov of one of the people Hannah actually blamed. That way, we could see how those tapes would affect somebody-because in my opinion, if I heard those tapes, and if I was one of the reasons Hannah died, I think I would feel guilty for a long, long time.<br />I don't know if anybody in real life has ever actually done what Hannah did, but I think it is cruel. So I guess I did not really like the plot of the story. It was unrealistic and harsh and unfair.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and addictive!  it can lag a speck at times but works great on the kindle fire!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|For the casual fans: this CD has plenty of love songs (who doesn't love a good love song?), much more than any other rock band I know of.  Bulletproof Heart and Summertime are a song to a significant other, saying you can run away with them, all you have to do is ask. The Only Hope For Me is You is a love song to a friend after witnessing a tragic event. \\"Where were you when all of the embers fell? I still remember there covered in ash, covered in glass, covered in all my friends. I still think of the bombs they built.\\" Doesn't that sound like 9/11 to you? It's saying, no matter what happens, I'm here for you. Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back is a love letter to the fans. \\"Get off the ledge and drop the knife. Not a victim of a victim's life.\\" They care about us, and to show it they wrote us this anti-suicide song.<br /><br />For the die-hard MCR fans: yes it's different. But it isn't as different as everyone says it is. Na Na Na and Vampire Money are both reminiscent of tracks like Headfirst for Halos, Dead!, House of Wolves, and Teenagers, with their bouncy vibe and obnoxious lyrics. Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back is very much like Thank You For the Venom and Famous Last Words, which was in my opinion, the best song they've ever written. Summertime is like Disenchanted, I Don't Love You and The Ghost of You. Party Poison is like The Sharpest Lives and This Is How I Disappear. The Only Hope For Me Is You and Bulletproof Heart, my favorite song off the album, are just like Helena or To the End.<br /><br />Regardless of similarities between this album and their past works, I believe this is a stellar work and good as a stand-alone album, or compared to the others.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|As a long time Joss Whedon fan, can't say enough how content I was just hearing A-listers spout his dialogue.  But enough about the guy who writes deep, rich, vibrant characters who are layered so delightfully.<br /><br />There's a long road for every character before the Avengers assemble.  Different mindsets, goals, egos, you name it stands in the way.  Like most hero stories, a tragic moment changes their lives and under a banner of understanding, they unite.  They are not soldiers of S.H.I.E.L.D.  Tony Stark reminds us of this.<br /><br />Loki is our villain along with intergalactic aliens he came upon between the time of Thor and the Avengers.  He knows who he is now and his journey isn't anything you'd expect.  Never lose sight of who Loki is while sitting there wondering why the villains are so weak.  He's the demi god with a plan and does he ever put it in motion.<br /><br />The Avengers is a character driven story and not a full on Michael Bay explosive fiesta for the eyes.  You will laugh... sometimes really hard.  You will cry.  Most of all... you'll have a damn good time.<br /><br />ENJOY!
0307956350|4.0|i really enjoyed this \\"mr. and mrs. smith\\" romp thru europe!  it had me guessing till the end...very original plot and a fast-paced read.  more twists and turns than the road to zermatt.  this is a first-time novelist and i look forward to more books from him.  very talented writer. my only complaint is that he never really describes the main character kate so i just had to imagine a physical type on my own - for some reason i was picturing a naomi watts type.  this book should be in everyone's beach bag!
B0059XTUVI|2.0|.... what you're left with is this movie.<br /><br />Margaret Thatcher had a profound effect on British politics. Not only the first woman prime minister, but also one of the most committed to her viewpoint, she took Britain by the scruff of the neck and shook it up. The changes Thatcher made were enormous, including destroying the coal-mining industry, increasing home ownership by selling off subsidised housing to the tenants, mobilising the country for a war in the Falkland Islands, slashing government spending and many more. Some people were helped by the changes, some hurt, some, such as the union leaders of the mining industry, destroyed. She was intensely, and deliberately, divisive. Her impact was such that the British Labour party completely reinvented itself as 'New Labour', a party unrecognizable from the old Labour party of the 1970s. Thatcher won 3 elections, became the UK's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century and was ultimately thrown out by her own party. Whatever your feelings towards her, she has to be regarded as the single most important political figure in the UK in the second half of the 20th century.<br /><br />The problem is that this film misses almost all of her impact on society, both positive and negative. Over half the film is given over to an imagined portrait of her in her later years, having conversations with her dead husband. The earlier part of her life is covered in flash-backs, so it lacks continuity and, often, context. In trying to present a portrait of the individual, the film-makers have diminished her actions to a side-issue which is, in her case, entirely inappropriate. Thatcher rarely spoke about her personal feelings and did not let others into her personal life. If ever a person were defined by what she did rather than who she was, it was Margaret Thatcher. The perspective of this movie is all wrong and what should have been a gripping tale of one of the most influential political figures of recent times becomes a rather dreary portrayal of a person in decline.<br /><br />Meryl Streep has been nominated for 17 Oscars and won 3 times. In my view, pretty well all of the 14 performances which did not win were better than this one. That's not a criticism of Streep, who is the most brilliant female actor of our time and turns in an immaculate performance as always. It's just that the part is so poorly drawn that Streep is hardly able to utilise her magnificent skills to make it come alive. Instead, I was left with the uneasy feeling that her Academy Award was not for acting but for impersonation. Streep has so often made characters compelling and unforgettable that to see her win for what was basically a female version of Rich Little was somewhat galling. I suspect in later years she will not look on this award as her finest achievement by a very long way.<br /><br />There is scope for an important film to be made about the life and impact of Margaret Thatcher. This is not it.

All quite well done. But when read in the sum of an entire story, it really sets itself apart.<br /><br />The remanents of mankind now reside in a silo. Certain rules must apply so that the survival of the silo is assured. Mankind must also be reminded of why they live in a silo. So the cleanings must take place every so often so that the inhabitants of the silo can see what has become of the outside world, the ruins of Earth.<br /><br />Howery takes us through this socialistic view of the offspring of the survivors of the apocalypse. He does not get preachy nor does he try to set a morality to his world. Yet he brings a message none the less. He has a strong character base and does a fabulous job at creating the world that is the silo.<br /><br />Well worth the read.
B007DIQAS8|5.0|I love Nicki Minaj's 2nd album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. My favorite songs are on this album is Roman Holiday, Beez in the Trap (feat. 2 Chainz), Roman Reloaded (feat. Lil Wayne), Right by My Side (feat. Chris Brown), Starships, Champion (feat. Nas, Drake, & Young Jeezy), Marilyn Monroe, Whip it, Stupid Hoe, Turn me On (with David Guetta), Va Va Voom, & Masquerade. In my humble opinion, this album is definitely the summer album of 2012. This album rocks!
0345803485|5.0|This book was very intense.  I do see what all the talk was about.  It certainly holds nothing back, as an adult I can see beyond the sexual nature of the book and look at the whole story not just pieces of it. I truely havn't read anything like it! It has me wanting to read more!
B007Y36K46|5.0|Despite all the negative reviews watched it.<br /><br />Was an awesome movie! The plot, which was specially criticized, was one of the strengths of the movie. The movie, clearly has more depth then the usual nonsense from Hollywood. Probably 10 times better in the storyline then the likes of Avatar (I did like Avatar - not for its storyline though).
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you have to build your village -feed the animals and collect coins to advance on.  i really love this game.  you have to complete challenges.  very addictict t times.
030758836X|5.0|Wow, Gone Girl grabs your attention right away with its excellent writing.  This book has received excellent reviews from authors and publications alike.  And it deserves it.  This is bound to be one of the must read books of the year...and I'm sure will be optioned as a movie.<br /><br />The characters that inhabit the world of Gone Girl are not nice people, in fact it is difficult to find redeeming qualities in any of them, but it doesn't matter because they are written so well.  Nick Dunne is completely full of himself and careens through life taking the easy way.  He is basically a self involved jerk.  Initially Amy seems likeable...the Amazing Amy...that's all I will say on that subject.<br /><br />I love that this is story for the times.  Nick and Amy have both lost their jobs and have retreated to Nick's home town.  He gets to be big man about town owning a bar (which Amy bought) with his twin sister.  Amy is lost without her hometown of New York City.  The town is full of the unemployed.  Industries are shutting down.  The huge mall that was the town's main bread and butter has shut down due to the economic recession.  Homeless, people are turning to drugs.  Gillian Flynn has captured the midwest recession perfectly.<br /><br />This book is full of amazing twists and turns.  The ending is legendary.  I highly recommend Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  It was released yesterday...don't wait to read this one...everyone will be talking about it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read! I am currently rereading them for the fourth time and each time is like the first time. I find myself wanting to be in Anastasia Steele's place...the books satisfy a need that you never realized was there!!! Must read for all ladies!!!!!!!!
0525425764|1.0|John Grisham must now be scraping the barrel. Absolute childish garbage. Suitable only for juveniles.  He must be running out of ideas.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although the literature is wonderful, the book is very repetitive as far as the sexual encounters.<br />The story unravels a dark past of Christian...which I found very intriguing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it. It an Irish twist on Mario. Its definently a must play! Luck of the Irish! Yep yep!!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|After doing a lot of research before purchasing my Kindle Fire tablet, I decided that I wanted \\"Splashtop Remote Desktop\\" for my remote desktop needs (part of the reason I orginally purchased the KF in the first place).<br /><br />After purchasing the app, installing it, getting intermittent use from it because of resolution and remote session disconnect problems, and going back-and-forth with their \\"help desk\\", I was very frustrated and not a little disappointed with the app and service provided.<br />***<br />So after a co-worker at my job reccommended \\"TeamViewer\\" for Kindle Fire, I deleted \\"Splashtop\\" ... and I haven't looked backed!<br /><br />Wish I could get my money back, but hey, that's the price I paid to learn about \\"TeamViewer\\"!!!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|It is no unusual thing that I would have ordered this movie---I have seen and have a copy of all of them now except the last!  I have all the books also I think this is a very interesting series, well written,produced and directed!  If Stephanie would write another to add to the series I would gladly watch it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps you busy when you are bored, keeps you coming back for more. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for some fun!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Part of the reason I purchased my Kindle Fire was to able to easily use my desktop remotely, make changes on files and shut the computer down.<br /><br />TeamViewer does all the above (and more) with ease, including being able:<br /><br />Maintain perfect resolution of desktop<br />Scroll On/Scroll Out<br />Access mutliple monitors<br />Control all desktop applications and functions<br /><br />P.S.  I download the (free) TeamViewer app for Kindle Fire becasue the (paid) Splashtop Remote app had very poor functionality and did not (even remotely) do what I needed.<br /><br />Just an FYI.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The movies are excellent. Given the fact blu ray has done away with region codes it makes little sense to get the US version of the entire set. The UK version is exactly what the average fan is looking for. All 8 movies and most of the behind the scenes footage, something this set doesn't offer, and can be gotten now for a third the price of that set due in September. Get this set now and you can wait and get the real directors ultimate set in a couple years
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was engaging and the characters were gripping.  The first few sexual encounters were interesting and new, but toward the end of the book they got to be boring for me. It reminded me of a bad musical when you're waiting for the musical numbers to be over with so you can get on with the story.  I began to skim over the sex sections toward the end of the book.  The mystery of who Christian is and how his earlier years contributed to his personality are the elements that really propel the book.  It gets rather tiresome with Ana thinking what she should be saying and then wondering why the communication in this relationship isn't up to par. I rather enjoy when Ana says what's on her mind and sticks up for herself. That is when we see a real leading lady.  But - I read this book every chance I could get and finished it in about 1 week.  That's worth 5 stars to me since the last fictional book I read took me over a year to read. One spanking for over-sexing the story.  I realize it's supposed to be a romance novel, but that doesn't mean hitting a quota of coitus just for the genre's sake.  Oh - and the ending is a ridiculous cliff-hanger - be prepared for that.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game to play. me and my brother both like it. he plags this game a lot
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Jeffrey Archer has done it again with another winner, I found the book well put together with a great story line, however, when one has to wait 12 months for this second chronicle, I found that I had to reread book one to get up to date.  Now I cannot wait to get my hands on the next installment.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun and so addictive.  I cant put it foam ever since I got it!! its so amazeing and awsome
0345803507|5.0|When I ordered 50 Shades of Grey, it was not because of the reviews I heard on TV. I wanted to find out for myself what it really was all about. It is not a sex manual, but a beautifully well written love story about a young man that was abused when he was very young. Was taught that sex was to be used as a way to have women be submissive and he not feel anything other than sexual relief. Until he met a young lady that showed him how to love himself and therefore love her. Beautiful love story. I read the entire thrilogy and recommend it highly.[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
0553801473|3.0|I have invested quite a bit of time reading this series.  I will see it to the end.  I just wish that end would come soon. This book is similiar to book 4 in that it seems to be stretching the story out for reasons other than the story.  Some of the storylines would best be served as spin offs rather than pushing this tome to 1000 pages and delaying the end to a series that seems to have peaked in book 3.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Loved the use of Slam Poetry throughout. Thought the story line was interesting and the characters had problems that weren't run of the mill.  Reading it can definitely be an emotional free for all if you're a crybaby like me. Mostly I loved that I could share it with my teenage daughter and not worry that the romance component was either too bland OR too graphic for her to enjoy.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Wow this movie was bad.<br /><br />I watched this movie last night. This movie left me with more questions than answers.  This movie rivals Red Tails in terms of poor character development, bad plot and awesome effects.<br /><br />I'm going to breakdown the movie here so if you don't want to read any of it, you better leave now.<br /><br />Lets start off with the beginning shall we?<br /><br />The opening scene with the guy killing himself, its an interesting scene, well constructed but lacks any meaning. There is no information about why he is doing it or what he hopes to achieve. Without more information, instead of being given information, we have to decide for ourselves what is really going on here. I don't really have a problem with that if you are given enough information to at least have a general sense of what it is that they are doing. The problem is that there is no information given, just a guy that could be having anything being done.<br />I've heard theories of ritualistic sacrifice that went wrong or right depending on the view point to seeding a planet with life. Truth be told, we don't even know what that is, in the end of the entire scene all we see is some DNA in the water that seems to be survive. However, if all that was meant to happen, why was the DNA being destroyed so utterly and completely by the thing he drank? Would you seed life on a planet by trying to destroy the very thing your trying to do? Seems totally and utterly illogical to me. I mean even if you intended to die in the process of giving life to a planet, wouldn't you do it in such a way that you don't destroy the very DNA your trying to spread? Not to mention, he uses something that looks very much like the stuff that was oozing from the containers found later in the movie. So why was he using that? Also the alien ship in the background looks nothing like the alien ships used by the engineers throughout the rest of the movie. Does this mean that its just another model or perhapsanother alien race? Is this some kind of shout out saying that the Engineers were defeated and this was a ritualistic way of ending his life like samurai used to do. I mean for all we know he was drinking their version of coffee and was about to go for a morning swim when he got poisoned, there just isn't enough information to make a proper logical deduction about the scene. Really, this calls out for explanation or the scene has little to no meaning in it. If it was left out of the movie entirely, I don't think anybody would have missed it. It doesn't contribute anything at all in the end except confusion.<br /><br />Well, lets fast forward a little bit then shall we, to lets say the ship. You have the robot walking around looking at peoples dreams while they are in their tubes, that is fine and all, I don't see people staying awake for 2 years like that so it makes sense. Then he walks around watching movies and playing basketball. I admit it gives him a very human appearance but to what end? Throughout the entire movie this robot seems to be a enigma. Does he have feelings or just a rudimentary understanding of human interaction? 1 line from Weyland himself could have ended this puzzle but instead they leave it once again up to us to puzzle it out. His actions and his words just seem to be very very odd. I would consider him a great deal like the android from Alien 1. Totally and utterly devoid of emotion and empathy with a job to do and to hell with everything else. However he seems to be sentient so perhaps just a psychopath? That is just what you get when you create something without a soul? Is that some underlying theme? Regardless, I'm just going to ignore him for the rest of the movie, he seems to be like superman, knows everything and does everything and everybody trusts him entirely. I guess Asimov's 3 rules of robots were never applied to him, or any other robot in this universe and nobody has any problem with that. Well, lets continue to say he is emulating humans quiet nicely, which means he is self aware, sentient and considering he has reactions to things around him, either pretending to have emotions or actually having emotions. He has just some insanely crazy lines in the movie. \\"Don't we all wish our parents were dead\\" is a good example of that. If somebody said that to you, wouldn't you get a bit worried. Especially if its a robot that may well consider humanity its parent and you have a crew of 17 that you have to rely on. Its just freakish that nobody seems to care.<br /><br />Well, now that we are done with the robot, lets continue on with lets say the rest of the crew shall we. Amazing spoiler here, Weyland is on that ship. His Daughter is on that ship, the robot, David which he considers his son is on that ship. That has to be the three most powerful people in the Weyland company on 1 ship that cost as they put it Trillions of Dollars in to making, so why don't we just get some randomly picked misfits together for the rest of the crew. I can understand the 2 scientists that were brought along as true believers, that is fine and all. Then a biologist who is a blank slate really, no real connection or anything to anybody but I'll get back to him later on when I dismember that tunnel scene preceding his death. The geologist, well, lets link him with Mr. Biologist cause face it, their only real interactions were with each other and they were so totally pointless that its unbelievable. Then we have a hand full of doctors for Weyland and a rather 2 dimensional Daughter of Weyland on the ship. The cabin crew were just strange and well, why wouldn't they be, its like they took the worst possible crew to go on an expedition like this. We all know that Weyland is a total moron but then again, I've got an entire section on him coming as well. Well, needless to say, I'll just end this crew analysis with this - Why would you spend Trillions of dollars, a vast fortune on all of this and then crew it by misfits? Easy, you wouldn't but it makes for some interesting television of done right. . .it wasn't done right.<br /><br />Lets continue on, its Christmas, hooray, lets go out with just a few hours of sunlight and a massive storm that a science vessel has no way of seeing until its only minutes away. . .interesting that they are even calling them scientists. I can understand some zealotry but when you land on a dead world after coming through a very interesting descent, what you want to do is rush out as soon as you land to enter some rocks. Its interesting how they explore those rocks, I'm sure glad that they didn't have more than 4 of those things to go explore with, I mean you might expect them to deploy a few from the main ship to analyse the ground area around them, search for nearby areas worth exploring or perhaps deploy them from space to I don't know, look for tell-tale signs of life down there. Nope, lets just fly down and just use the good old fashioned fly around till we see something we like, I'm glad that they found it so fast, I mean wouldn't the movie have been boring if they had spend 3 weeks flying around looking around for mounds to be piled in rows, cause we all know that can't be natural. Regardless, it would have just been strange if they had dropped something down and scanned the entire planet like that because then you would expect all survey vessels to do the same in the future in which case Aliens 1 might be explained away cause they are a freight hauler but Aliens 2 would be rather strange. So lets just pretend I'm the only one that is smart enough to see that the application of technology seems to be well. . .rather stupid here. Anyways, lets continue on cause there is so much to say and I bet by now nobody is reading this anymore. Congratulations to those of you that still are managing to keep going at this point since I'm still only just starting. Back to the point of this paragraph is really this - Are they charging out and doing stuff that no scientist would do and are they misusing technology they took along with them, why yes, yes they are. Why are they doing that? My guess is because they have a crew of misfits that shouldn't be there.<br /><br />Fast forwarding again, they travel out with their lovely vehicles, very nice all terrain vehicles at that, as long as everything is flat, not rocky and you know, built like a highway. I mean its obvious that those are the conditions they were expecting to find. Lets forget about that for now - like we may all wish to forget about this movie later. Off they travel to the first mound, instantly find an entrance that thankfully David can read, decipher and open within moments. We all know that if your in a scientific research center or military base or whatever it is since it wasn't actually explained in the movie, you wouldn't expect any safety issues. I mean they are only handling the most dangerous things that may come to mind in this universe, why wouldn't you at least put a padlock on the door. Nope, just a standard opening of everything. Well, they enter and why not have air here, I mean we all hate those big bulky things they are wearing to keep the atmosphere out. So lets take them off cause we all know, unknown atmospheres are harmless. I mean its not like scientists would have any idea about diseases from one place having incredibly harmful effects on others. I mean when the Spanish traveled to South America they found out that the diseases they were immune to were harmless to all those millions and millions of people they wiped out there by you know, sneezing on them. So that goes to show, another scientific mundane useless thing done, you would expect with only 17 people that you wouldn't want half your crew down with the alien version of the plague on day 1. Regardless, a bit later David spots a computer console up on a wall and guess what, he manages to climb up some rocks on a wall that doesn't appear to have had a cave in, meaning it was built thatway. . .strange. . .to activate something on the wall to show a holographic representation of people running scared somewhere. Now call me crazy but other than looking interesting and cool, what kind of thing is that good for? I am hard pressed to think of any good reason that it was there, easily accessible and how it all fits together. They follow it to find a dead Engineer and then the Geologist and Biologist freak out and leave. . .cause we all know a biologists dream wouldn't have anything to do with finding an alien life form that he could analyse or whatever. I mean its very interesting to find a person so scared of a dead alien who then runs off with a geologist and gets lost. . .I mean wow.<br /><br />Anyways, here it breaks off in to 2 parts of stupidity. Firstly that the geologist and biologist get lost when you can easily see where they are from the ship and you can tell that they basically went down 1 tunnel, so your talking about them getting lost between going right or left. Regardless about them, I'll get back to them again in a minute, lets continue on the lines of utter stupidity, David manages to open the door and what do we have there, a head that has no meaning, I didn't even see the arms cradling the room. Its a storage room, where did the 2 Engineers that made it in there run off to? Why did they run off in to there? What were they running from? What was so scary that they were willing to decapitate one of their friends to close the door? If they were running away from something that had them that scared, why wasn't it captured on the holographic projections? Assuming they survived (since their bodies were not inside) why didn't they clean up the mess? Never explained, I guess since they are in the room now, no further explanation is required. These vats then all over the ground begin to ooze after the humans enter, seems a great deal like the Face-Hugger eggs to me in a 'prehistoric form'. Rather cut and dry but it doesn't seem to alarm anybody that there are vats spewing out organic material all around them that seems to have been activated by their arrival. No cause for alarm I guess, it could be their version of mustard gas or its an alien Christmas celebration that just happen to be starting at the same time. . .you know if they believed in that. No cause for alarm there. Then at the back of the room we had something else, a rather interesting piece of architecture - an alien design in to a wall. Really? It looks exactly like an alien really, the design doesn't seem to have much detail so it leaves a great deal to the imagination but its easy to spot the tell tale features of an alien. Then the mural, I honestly didn't really get a good view of it at all. There were 6 of us, nobody say the hands or got any idea what the mural was about, let alone that it seems rather out of place doesn't it. Everything is barren rock, some of it carved and otherwise incredibly materialistic, yet we have murals in a storage room. . .Look a storm is coming, I'm glad this trillion dollar spaceship can detect a storm coming and give people a 15minute time frame to escape. . .<br /><br />Well, as I said, that was a 2 part stupidity, so after the escape, I won't even go in to the 'event scene' there, I don't feel I really have to, obviously something to make the masses get worked up about something, I mean so far nothing other than stupidity has happened, none of the characters are more than 1 dimensional cutouts except the main cast which are of course, 2 dimensional - they have managed to prove themselves both stupid and extremely dedicated, mainly dedicated to their stupidity over anything else, but still, its something more than the rest of them. Well, back to the Biologist who turned his back on what was most likely going to be his crowning achievement on his life's work because door scary and of course the Geologist who really I don't even know why they took him. . .I mean he is a Geologist, what did they hope to use him for? This rock appears very old, I'm glad that we took him. The entire reason they took him was to release those things that flew around that they only use in the caves to repeat myself from earlier. Glad they couldn't train a monkey to do that, the monkey might have been more useful to an expedition like this. . .Sigh. . . Anyways, they get lost, they get told that there is a life form reading while they are standing around a bunch of dead Engineer bodies that guess what, Mr. Biologist isn't willing to even really look at. There are some obvious trauma's that are about the size of guess what, that thing they come across later on. . .now tell me, 2 people scared of a door wouldn't make a connection like that? Worm with the same size as the hole in all these dead creatures. . .must be harmless, a door scared us before, lets play with these things, if anything its moving around and everything like a cobra, we all know they aren't dangerous. . .Well, not to spoil a good death scene, I might as well continue cause it wasn't good, totally and utterly retarded.<br /><br />Fast forward a bit further, nobody notices David stealing a vat, well, I would guess that isn't really a shock, David seems to be running up ahead, looking at things, clicking stuff, doing whatever he wants all the time and usually only after he has done it, something happens that brings it back to David, you might think people that are scared might pay a closer eye on somebody doing things that keeps freaking them out. Guess not. Anyway, now we are back on the ship, David spikes lead scientists drink who seems incredibly drunk, never really explained why he is so depressed, ooh, he didn't find the aliens alive, guess that the most monumental discovery in your life on a small remote part of a planet must mean that they have gone extinct, what can I say, its dedication to stupidity, its what his character is made of. Then of course the entire bridge is empty when the people are having their close encounter with an alien life form, cause with 17 people on the ship, nobody would be awake when your on an alien planet in case something happened. Especially considering you have 3 bridge crew that seem to only have to stay on the ship. . .Lets avoid that shall we. Lets also avoid the fact that the ship is a scientific ship that apparently doesn't hold logs of things like when a team member contacts in. I mean its not something you would want to keep records of. Regardless. That I think was about the point were my stupidity tank hit its full capacity. Its an amazing thing to suddenly realize that the movie is so bad you should stop trying to think of it in any other tone other than a cartoon from the 70s.<br /><br />Well, lets just hit some of the big bases still since I'm tired of writing this and face it, I doubt anybody is going to read all of this.<br /><br />Lets see, they go back for their dead crew, and guess what, they come back with only 1, guess the other one wasn't worth caring about till he shows up at the ships doorstep with hulk smash powers. Not to mention a giant metal truck, gasoline, guns, everything on him, he still survives ages, I mean since gravity is the same on this planet as Earth (as seen by how people move around), I don't care how much alien tissue you have flip-flopping through your system, you drive over him with a giant vehicle, shoot his brains out, torch him, any of them will get a kill.<br /><br />Then again, we got the scene with the scientist dedicated to stupidity sacrificing himself, how noble of him. Why are there medical bays if you have no intention of using them? Why in a space craft where most medical emergencies most likely will involve something happening outside are there no direct entrances to medical facilities from outside?<br /><br />Lets see, David finds a live Engineer. Good for him. Wakes him up, I'm glad that Weyland wants to live forever. I mean he really wants it so he comes unarmed, unprepared to defend himselfagainst a possibly hostile alien, totally no precautions taken and wakes him up and asks for immortality. Don't worry though, no explanation given why the alien decided to go crazy and kill everybody.<br /><br />Why did the Engineers want to wipe out all life on Earth? Seems like a great deal of trouble to wipe out all life on Earth by releasing a new life form that is capable of wiping Engineers out in the process. I mean wouldn't you create something that would be obedient? Ooh it got away from them, that will be the main argument about why it went the way it went. Well, I guess a species as materialistic wouldn't believe in safeguards. Also why would Weyland believe they could give him immortality. Wouldn't his hopes for that be dashed the moment he heard they used sleeper chambers themselves. They know how to make things immortal cause they put themselves to bed on long trips cause they don't want to age either, must mean they just don't do it to themselves for some reason.<br /><br />Then the entire thing where the medical chamber was only meant for a male, why would you seriously seriously remove the medical information for a woman? Who owns it. . .the Daughter of Weyland. . .WHY WOULD SHE HAVE IT!!!!<br /><br />The girl breaks out of the medical bay with alien baby in her belly, then does a cesarean section in graphic movie fasion. . .glad nobody decided to find out where she removed alien baby, since there is only 1 place on the ship to do it other than the room she was in. Nobody went to clean it up, an alien baby which turned in to huge octopus creature. STRANGE. Guess that must be why face huggers die right after they finish laying an egg or why they only come out of those eggs themselves right before doing it, cause otherwise they would somehow pull nutrition straight from a cosmic black hole that exists inside their tummies to grow to massive proportions and become what you see in that medical bay, a giant squid baby.<br /><br />Now out of all the scientist, the pilot played by Idris, deduces the alien facility is a military installation (with poor security protocols-unless David is that damn good).  For which the aliens test Weapons of mass destruction and plan to take the black goo back to earth via their holographic version of google maps.<br /><br />Also why did they have the alien pilot in that chair, looking exactly like the pilot from \\"Alien\\"? Then he leaves the chair to lay the smack down on the Squids' mamma in the medical carrier only to get eaten by the alien squid baby.<br /><br />The the all knowing David (I used have guys like this in my Calc classes), knows how to fly the alien life boat, but our heroine wants to go the alien pilot's home world to ask the all to important question:<br />WHY?<br /><br />I hate to think that they are planning a sequel.<br /><br />I love Sci-Fi, I'm not hard to entertain.  But a starmap>A pale 8 foot humanoid alien (who works-out alot), a random snake thing, a squid baby and David the android.  Damn, I mean you are Ridley Scott.<br /><br />All I can say about this movie is that it must score a 1 or a 2 on a scale of 100. If it were any worse, it would be rated on a turkey scale, not a real scale. I rate my movies on a scale based on characters, character development, story lines, story line development and consistency.<br /><br />Now I read somewhere that this movie was a prequel to the Aliens saga. If they had left out the Alien architecture on the wall in the room with the head, removed the alien birth at the end of the movie and the ships being identical to that found in Alien 1 and 2, you would be able to make some interesting connections but it wouldn't be considered anything related.<br /><br />My recommendation in the end is, if you have half a brain or you analyse your movies while watching them or care much for things like acting, characters being more than 1dimensional and a story line that is horrible and instead you can still be taken aback by pretty lights, good graphics and are willing to forgive/forget the rest, go for it.<br /><br />This movie really lacked plot, characters, story line and above all else, the one thing that should never be left out in a prequel, dedication to the original story line. It is a very hard thing to do, to end a movie at the same point another movie can begin from when that other movie has already been out for what? 33years? It really is tough. The bar is set so high that Olympic athletes could pole vault under it on the moon. Yet I'm glad to see that there are people out there still that can manage to limbo under it better than even the world record holders. They really attempted to dig a tunnel underneath the platform instead of go for gold. I guess an dishonorable mention in the toe tags of a franchise is better than nothing for them.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This release contains versions of the Star Wars trilogy that have been heavily edited.  The colors have been digitally changed, the audio is not the same, and there are parts added and parts missing (2 songs from \\"Return of the Jedi\\" are missing and \\"Star Wars\\" is censored so that when imperial officers get hit, there used to be flaming holes in their bodies- this is gone now).  Also, there are obvious changes like Greedo shooting first, Darth Vader screaming \\"Nooooo\\" like he did in Revenge of the Sith, the actor who played old Anakin is gone in the ghost scene- also there is Jar-Jar at the end of Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />Please give us the real movies!

0345803493|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in 3 days and am halfway thru the 2nd book. Cant get Christian Grey out of my head and wonder how they could get away with doing a movie!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Many of the films and written stories we really like have a deeper foundation than we realize. JC, after thinking about the film met many of the requiements of the hero myth.<br /><br />Joseph Campbell wrote a book called \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\\" along time ago. He was the #1 person in the world, as an expert, on myth. He said that the same stories of the hero are in all cultures forever and these stories provide inspiration for those who follow. He made a video series named \\"The Power of Myth\\".One of the episodes (#5) was \\"The Hero's Adventure\\". During that episode Campbell visits Skywalker Ranch and with clips of Star Wars explains how he helped develop with Lucas the story from the structure of the Hero Myth. Sadly J. Campbell dies before the later Star Wars (Ep. 1-3) are made.<br />After thinking about the movie JC, it has almost all of the ingredients of the Hero Myth, but I had to think about them for awhile. Maybe what makes this thought provoking is the sequence is different.<br /><br />HERO MYTH IN FILMS AND EXAMPLES<br /><br />QUEST or powerful reason to move from where you are: Star Wars: family is killed, Gladiator: family is wiped out, Harry Potter: parents are killed. John Carter: family wiped out changes him.<br /><br />Goes to THE EDGE (the last place before the adventure into the unknown begins); Star Wars: the bar, Gladiator: the slave market, Lord of the Rings: also the bar. JC: the bar.<br /><br />Many times, at this place, he MEETS THE SKEPTIC a person that is actually good but appears that he could be helpful or trouble, either way. Star Wars: Hans Solo, LoR: Stridder, JC - maybe the army officer who notes the good in him.<br /><br />THE MENTOR: In Star Wars Obiewan gives himself up to die by the hands of Darth Vader - I always wondered why and it is so Luke can take charge of his quest- a sacrificial graduation to his destiny, Gladiator: Oliver Reed, LoR: Gandoff. JC: maybe the 4 armed Martian. The only thing is usually that characterhas to die so that the hero can become his own person and mature. (many times comes back in flashbacks or other ways)<br />In JC it doesn't seem to happen.<br /><br />GOES TO THE DESERT or someplace to find himself anew: SW:starts there, Gladiator: Yes,Glad school, JC: no bigger desert than Mars.<br /><br />HERO USUALLY SACRIFICES himself for the betterment of all. Sometimes is resurected or comes back in spirit etc. Star Wars: ?, Glad: R. Crowe dies, LoR :dies, Harry Potter: comes back. John Carter he is dead at the start and his spirit (or duplicate) goes to Mars as a savior.<br /><br />Joesph Campbells original book included Mohammed, Jesus and many others as having many of the same elements of the hero's journey.<br /><br />I felt that JC met most of the aspects of the hero myth and that kept me thinking (for weeks after I saw the movie) as to how they fit in. I read 2 of the ERB books after seeing the film to help and they are very good. Most films don't keep me thinking about them later though they may be great movies at the time.<br /><br />It was interesting to me how He went to the same situations on another planet. Civil War , Indians to Green guys, two factions, both fighting and both wanting to conquer or defend.<br /><br />And did the Therin start our Civil War since they were (in the movie)in our world too. Loved Woola character kinda represents loyalty and love no matter what you look like.<br /><br />I watched the trailer again on the Disney site and it never mentions that he is on another planet. There is only one statement someting like \\"they may come to Earth next\\". That could have been from a 50's scifi invasion film. I think that they left the who, what, why etc. out of it.<br /><br />Loved the film and I wonder how much money it really did lose. They said a while ago around 200 mil. But the movie has made internationally 292 + mil ( cost to make 250 Mil). Disney said that it cost over 100 mil for advertising. I sure didn't see the same flood ofcommercials, product endorsements from Coke, Burger King etc. as I did for many of the other films. I think they should look at what they spent on promotion one more time and consider making the next film.<br /><br />Hope I didn't ramble too much and please forgive my spelling errors
B0086700CM|5.0|It is very fun..and you get points and unlock new things for scoring good and it has a good varierty of things you can do ..
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is well written and very informative. The author does a fantastic job of explaining the importance of nutrition as well as exercise. His ideas are based on scientific studies and not just his own personal experiences. I've just finished reading the book and will update this review once I've been on his program for a few months.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the game but would like more ways to gain acorns. I purchase an acorn tiger pack but I did not get my acorns.  dry upset that I paid my money but did not get my acorns
B007N85ZXY|1.0|I don't understand why Neil released this CD...it is truly awful. Such on odd selection of songs...uninspired arrangements...feels like something cooked up and recorded in one afternoon. Background vocals are so irritating. Nine year wait for this? Ugh. I'm seeing him at Red Rocks in Aug and pray he doesn't play any of this...if he does I GUESS I'd have to pick Wayfarin Stranger or Gallows Pole...but really the only good thing is the CD artwork design.
034544678X|5.0|This is a bit longer read than most of her other books. However, if you have the time and would like to understand how to better communicate with your dog, this is one of the best books you will find. McConnell is a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist, which means she has a Ph.D in animal behavior, so she really knows her stuff. This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I highly recommend it! Note that this is not a training book, but rather a book to help you better understand your dog - which, in my opinion, will really enhance any training you do with your dog.
1439153663|5.0|This was a beautifully written story - heartbreaking, suspenseful and engaging.  I can't wait for more work from this author!
1416583432|3.0|Ever wondered how dogs experience the world? We know their senses of smell and hearing are far superior to ours. Did you know their vision is also different than ours? If you want to gain a better understanding of how dogs experience the world, or if you want to understand your own dog better, start by reading this book. While there were some things I disagreed with and did not like about this book, if you can look past those things, there are some good things in the book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|so i tried a sample of what everyone's talking about. couldn't stand more than a few pages, it's so badly written: repetitious adjectives, discontinuous dialogue , and tired plot. spend the money on &#34;story of o&#34; if you prefer well-written dominance erotica.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|it was pretty Good till i had to start over and I spent 5$on glu points but that got deleted so I gust wasted 5$ on nothing

B0053JJLLC|4.0|i do not understand all the negative reviews. this book is one of the best books ever! but it really needs to not say the f-word every five or ten pages.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|She should be given other roles.  It is rare to find a beauty that does her own stunts. I did some research on her career in martial arts and she rocks seriously.
B000FC13E0|4.0|I don't see why there are so many bad reviews. This book is awesome and very action packed! The reason I gave it four stars was, because it was kind of gross (enough to be rated R) and there was a lot of use of the F-word. Other than that, good book!
