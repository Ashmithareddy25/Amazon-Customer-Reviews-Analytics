B008BU75IQ|5.0|Another great Jeffrey Archer novel that leaves you hanging at the end so you can hardly wait for the next book to be available.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Did not really enjoy this movie. I think that James Franco and Milan kunis did a great job at playing their parts. Unfortunately the movie kind if sucked.
B00BZOD63S|4.0|Great film to watch on a dark night alone or cuddled up on the couch. Great story line and even better acting.. Ending is a little weak
B009XIXVU6|3.0|A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is one of my favorite novels--I have read and reread it five times. THE KITE RUNNER is another great read.  I waited years for this author's new book--pre-ordered it and marked the calendar for the day it would be out.  Maybe my expectations were a little too high.  Don't get me wrong--this is a good read but not on a par with his others. Starts out GREAT then as more and more story lines and timelines are offered--all revolving around decisions and the effects ensuing from them--I became almost annoyed waiting for an &#34;oh wow&#34; moment.  But it never came. Perhaps that is the premise of the book--people come and go in life and you never know the rest of their story. Still, I will wait more years for his next novel!!!
B00633W614|5.0|I truly enjoy Jeffrey Archer novels.  My interest holds from the first page to the last.  I enjoy following the events of the families as they unfold.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|Every toy story has been great. One trilogy that didn't go downhill from the first. This movie is watched regularly.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I really enjoy hidden object games and this one was no exception. If your a fan of the genre then you will like this is well. As I played through the game there are only two things that I noticed could be improved in future versions. The text Auto advanced which caused me to miss some of the story. The other feature I found myself wanting was a zoom feature.  Some of the objects were small and hard to see.  Overall a great game that ran stable.
B002RI9Q3A|5.0|Brilliantly readable; history at it's best! A wonderfully re visited account of WW2, without the propaganda.  The human face of leadership.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can't do anything with pencil and paper. what is through the window? I like this game except when I'm stuck.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|it's ok.  wouldn't walk out of my way to see, but it is just mindless enough to work if you are looking for some mindless entertainment,  story line is a bit predictable, but it's a fairy tale turned around.  didn't love the fact they couldn't decide what century they were portraying..
B000WQW988|5.0|Great sound, good picture, excellent concert for Nirvana fans.  An excellent recording that night, but the Lilly's on the stage are a bit eerie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|. LoviNgly recommended to everyboneLove the game we are having a great time with all the family playing thing game
B003V5CFV8|5.0|&#34;O' Brother, Where Art Thou?&#34; is a wonderful throwback to when films were about story and character. Brilliant acting, wonderful screen play and an amazing sound track make this a great film. Probably not for the all action all the time crowd. George Clooney takes his charming personality and becomes a con man on the run. Every character, even quick cameos are fully played and interesting on their own. T Bone Burnett's sound track is a wonder.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|If you like Jo Nesbo books, then read this. It is undoubtfully the best book he wrote. Much better than Nemesis and the head hunter stuff
B0090O07RS|5.0|You can really hear the incredible voice Jim Morrison had on this Blu-ray recording.  For a 1968 concert the sound is pretty darn good, but a high quality sound system would be best to really enjoy the music.  A must have for your rock and roll music history collection.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron Man 3: the official game is better than the official movie! It's exactly like temple run, but better! Sadly the  movie was terrible. Seriously, fire people? It's like twilight. More fictional than real. The cast was terrible and the movie was really sad and waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy be better than different than the first two. My favorite part of this game is the upgrades. I gotta get that $500 dollar gift card because the only thing worse than temple run is the prices. I'm trying to get 15000 diamonds/crystals but it's $99.99. On temple run it's $19.99. Well that's the only thing.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|with Enemy at the Gate, only wish the Atlantis movie was made. Shepard sums it all up in &#34;The Daedlus variations: It's Atlantis!&#34;
B009FZHYKU|2.0|The 2 first seasons where much better, it look like they do not have any story going to much conversation and no in-off action.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I like it as much as SG1.  I have always been a Stargate fan and I like the Atlantis series as much
B008KP6ENE|1.0|That Damn jumping sound drove me crazy! I realize I have a volume button... But why should I have to Turn the sound off within 5 minutes of playing? Yawn
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Return of the Ancients, changing the replicator base code, perfect setup for Season 4, in my opinion is the best season yet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Get to pick my own cards and background! Has all the options you want. Hours of fun... probe not a good thing with that... back to work!!!!!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  Great graphics and easy game play  Get it now you won't be  disappointed. Gave it five stars
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is the best pinball game I've played since I played on a actual pinball machine, some may say it's even better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lol I loved this game. Had to cheat a little bit but I still liked it. Please hurry up and make more rooms
B005LAII1C|4.0|Yes, the movie contains a foul-mouthed teddy bear that sounds akin to a certain Family Guy character. Plus it has Mila Kunis in a role that oddly enough makes her look as loved (at times) as Meg Griffin. However, it's a movie easy to love. The plot is simple yet familiar. To an extent, it feels as shocking and unpredictable as a Family Guy episode. There's plenty of bonus features and fine PQ/AQ to go around. As a movie-goer, this represented one of my favorite films of all 2012, and the BD is not too far behind.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this game is great and fun. It keeps me busy for hours. I also play all the other Virtual City games as well. I Would definitely recommend it to others.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|A wonderfully Down to the depth of consciousness look back at neglect and pure selfishness of parenting.  Shows us all how a few small kind acts can make a difference in a child's life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my mind is reeling! even my husband is addicted.<br />downloaded this game on a whim.  I've been playing all day. very addicting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept my interest the whole time. I'm looking forward to reading book two right after I write this review.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was my first time playing this sort of game and I liked it.  Challenging enough without being too difficult.  Hope for new levels soon.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|This was a great movie! I enjoyed it from start to finish. I know very little about MMA and quite frankly don't typically care for overly &#34;sporty&#34; movies, but really enjoyed the cast of this movie and the story line. It was as compelling to me as Rocky was 20 years ago.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game! I prefer it over regular solitaire. If you have not tried it you should give it a try
B0081336FO|5.0|I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of the two stars or of great television!  Don't miss it!
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Whereas Ender's Game moved along at a rather fast clip, maintaining momentum and interest. SFTD became tedious at times with repetitive ruminations
0316174483|5.0|A wonderful book full of simple, fun designs people of all ages can enjoy.  Recently ordered some colored finger print pads.  I'm sure my Niece will love this gift!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best escape game i have ever played! And i have played a ton of them,yay this is so cool
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Show was ok. Interesting to see what happened during tsunami, but not as exciting as other disaster flims I've seen.
B004V71CYQ|1.0|Only rented it to get context for 2012 Tron.  New one somewhat better than old one.  Neither flic rates more than 1 star.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This is a real laugh-out-loud funny book! I really liked it. As you read it, you can really image Tina saying those things.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is now my favorite. I think lauren Oliver did an excellent job!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but would be nice to be able to save what you have done in the middle of a room.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Sooo I read many reviews before continuing to read this series and even after all the bad reviews, I read it anyway.  If ur looking for a quick read this is for u. Does it answer any of ur questions from the first 2 books no<br />Does it get more complicated? yes<br />Did the author give u anything good in this book no def left us hanging. I'm like the rest I am very upset she gave up on the 3rd book like this. it's like she had to get in to reach deadline and she will continue with the next. Will I continue reading it? I just might because I want this story to just end.  Put this has really seem to become more about the money then keepin your readers.<br />More characters to now remember and more story lines  I wish she will start cutting people out
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent but way too short.  If another another season is planned , I hope so, let's give it more episodes.
0140067477|5.0|I ordered this for my Grandson. He is taking Honors English for his Sophmore year in high school. This is required reading for him. He does not like to read but has already started reading and is actually enjoying this book.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Started off not liking this but was very soon hooked and couldn't put it down. A satisfactorily twisted ending. Excellent.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Watches again and again. well worth purchasing. We rented for a sleepover and she begged me to purchase on amazon prime.
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|This 2pack is a great set for an affordable price (even less expensive than what a Toys R Us would sell it as; if you get free shipping). These two are doing a science experiment for their Mad Science class. Ghoulia is wearing a outfit inspired by both her Zombie motif and the Periodic Table of Elements! While our favorite Egyptian is wearing an outfit inspired by her Mummy roots. I also love that they are wearing matching earrings 'GH,F,F'' which stands for 'Ghoul Friends Forever!'<br /><br />A wonderful product to be sure :)
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is really good,but the only part I regret getting it is that it is not an as<br />long game.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved the way it was written, beautiful, unlikely story. Will appeal to anyone who loves the walking and the psychological unravelling of a life.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Don't like the update at all.The other version was much more user friendly.Hate having to wait for it to come up and then it is difficult to go from one page to another.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is one of my favorite match games.  I love the different levels and the challenge of each.. The downside is it's hard to stop.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Strange film, but also really funny in spots. Don't know what else to say other than its an original story film, and it was mostly fun to watch. Don't think Wahlberg was a good fit for the film.
B0093F3PUA|5.0|Not an oasis fan,i learned about Noel through Paul Weller.Took a chance on this dvd and loved it.Only thing lacking is some rapport with audience since what he does say is incomprehensible with his accent.Could have used subtitles.Music is exciting and band is great.
B000H0Y0CM|2.0|There is not good acting in movie.  The plot is not there. Arnold S. was fairly good.  Would not recommend movie to anyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show! Well written, great characters, and fun to watch. I have downloaded the third season and cannot wait to see it.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I put off watching this film for some time as I liked the original film. However, after watching this version of the film/story, I thought it was better than the original. And Karl Urban is a better Dredd than Sylvester Stallone. Its a good film, with an interesting story and lots of action.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Having Adobe on my Kindle is a great convenience. It was easy to download and even easier to navigate with the user guide.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show.  Enjoyed it all. I've watched it before on tv. Just as good on the kindle. Into the next season.
B0029ZA49Q|5.0|I found this very useful especially when i had a back pack. With a side shoulder strap, my camera bag used to interfere with my back pack. This strap resolved the problem.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|The main human character is a bit annoying at times, but the film is fun and interesting to watch. Good Story. Good production values. Well done!
B009S8PEHY|3.0|but prefer his regular songs...used this at holiday time on my office music system that we had playing in the waiting room.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I couldnt put these books down!  The only down side is that the final book of the series wont be out until April2014! Groan!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|At first it was way out there but it has grown into a very interesting series, I hope there is a season two.
B00821OX98|4.0|Although I mostly enjoyed watching all of the episodes at once (thanks Prime!), I had to skip several episodes due to the story becoming incongruent with the main story idea, that is, I became annoyed at some of the aspects of the story and the setup of the story in several of the episodes. Nothing out of Gollywood is spot on these days, but do you really think people would be doing what they are doing in several of the episodes given the main story line. Oh well.
0375714669|5.0|I was able  to relate to this biography and ordered a few copies to send to friends. A good book for book club discussion.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Strange combinations of humor, Hong Kong style martial arts, adventure, amazing soundtracks, gotta love it.  Highly personal though.  Don't watch two without seeing vol. 1 first.
B00BMQDM10|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella & she did not disappoint with her new novel. Full of fun, intrigue, mystery & romance. I have read all of Sophie's books & am a real fan. Great light hearted reading.
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|The app worked fine, but personally, I think there are other apps that work better.  The sounds were really basic and I couldn't get a sound combo that I liked.  I suppose my rating is more of a preference issue than a mechanics issue.  So, I would encourage someone to try this one before judging it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book will break your heart.  It was extremely will written.  The characters are unforgettable.  Books such as this one open our minds and hearts to people in other lands and cultures.
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate series has an exceptional group of imaginative creators.  Time well spent continues.  Actors give extraordinary performances, episode and character stories made me make as much time as possible to watch.  Sets, costumes and special effects are amazing!  Sue Michaelsen
B00821OX98|3.0|Season two is far better. The special effects in season one are terrible. Some of the acting is over the top.
B008383GE8|5.0|A fantastic read... Very interesting informative and deep. Krauss has a great way of explaining concepts in plain English. Well done.
B000I9YX06|5.0|Entertaining and chilling. Another good story about how technology will destroy us in the end. I don't know why it's such a popular theme, but I'm sure it isn't going away any time soon.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game, very addicting!! I can't stop playing it and get better with every game I start.  Enjoy.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Thrpe game is not the product here. Your personal info is. Buyer beware, and if you MUST play only do it while on flight mode and clear the app afterwards
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I liked the way it combined ancient time with today's world.  The story has a moral without being too preachy.  It's a very fast read.
B0013D89YM|5.0|Best album ELO has ever done. I have this album on vinyl but wanted a cleaner sound. I also had on cassette but nothing clean like digital.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome. Some levels are easy and some are a little bit trickier but all in all its a really good game
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|The cinemaphotograhy was GREAT!!!! I liked that the movie took it's own spin on this great American classic but still held true to the original's most iconic scenes.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Didnt turn out how I assumed it would from the previews,, and from other movies like Salt with Angelina Jolie..  kinda sets up the ending for a  sequel but I dont know where it would go from here.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Beautiful story unfolded through the eyes of two women, one the wealthy owner and one the help, just as slavery is ending. A real page-turner. Having finished this book two weeks ago, I continue to want to return to the book and continue the story. Lavinia and Belle ... you will remember them ...
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Broken City has a fair amount of action and a couple of good actors but is fairly predictable and lacks any punch.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|It is a timeless film even though it takes place in the 1930s and 1940s.  The internal emotional drama taking place is the key to this films greatness.  Many people have struggled with what feels right and moral opposed to certain hard and fast rules and regulations.  This film shows the struggles and decisions people make that will alter their lives.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|This cd mesmerized me with its complex music runs and rhythms. You have to appreciate how much work it took to put all of this together.
6304698623|5.0|The movie is a film I've been looking for,for so long. I remember watching it when I was growing up, it's a really nice movie. I  want my kids to enjoy the movie.
B004E5D2M0|5.0|The best part of this HBO series was the coverage of Anne Bolyn. After she was executed, the stories were less exciting.  I still recommend the series - no regrets here!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|This movie was a bit boring to me. I just couldn't get into it.  It wasn't worth the rental price.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you are a parent this book will really make you think about the choices our children make, and what we as parents would do to protect our children.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is great!!!!!! Way better than wedding salon. I highly recommend this app for people that love makeup!! You get to wash her hair, pop her  pimples , and put on her makeup!!! And decide a beautiful dress and stuff!!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I did not expect it to be this good. Some awkward acting at moments but over all a great movie.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|I just watched this with my dad and it is a great horror movie. Mama couldn't come close to this, this was the closest thing I've seen to true horror in years honestly. It wasn't perfect but it got the job done and it wasn't overly long it got straight to the point. Very spooky and it will unravel you at night.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I Really enjoy this game and I think it is very fun and challenging. It is pretty well... I hope they make more like it...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really had an enjoyable time playing this game and cannot wait for new levels to come out.  Puzzles get more difficult as you progress but not unsolvable.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like this game. It keeps you wandering what's going to happen next. I just think it would be cool if the last two items to find wasn't so hard to find.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I think this game is good but you should make a campaign that doesn't require internet but this game is the bomb
0156034026|4.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes thought provoking books. It really made you think about how we all react to situations.
B006DGOV9Q|5.0|this battery is realy good. its giving me good backup for around 2 full day. it really has good performance.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|This crime family had me in the edge of my seat! I purchased the 1st & 2nd season. Awesome job and great work!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I am glad that I rented this movie. It was great. I watched it two times, because it is so good. It is for sure five stars !!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Despite the fact that I had to read this for summer reading, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A great deal of this was due to the fact that I was able to connect with the main character, William. He and I are both very much interested in renewable energy and electricity, and that set this book aside from many others I've read in the past. Not only that, but this book made it clear to me that I am able to do many of the things I've wanted to, especially if a boy living in rural Malawi can. For those readers maybe not so interested in the scientific aspect of this book, there are many stories from the childhood of William that are equally entertaining, as well as define exactly what the situation was that William was living in. When my teacher first described this book, I already knew that I would like it, and I was not disappointed.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|An excellent fantasy replete with suspense.<br />The streaming process, on the other hand, slowed or paused several times during the viewing session. I found that somewhat annoying.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|This is a very interesting movie with some great twists and turns and is funny and sweet.  This is a must see.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game not to hard not to easy.  look forward to more levels. keep up the good work. when will you have more
B000FBJAEG|4.0|The chemistry between Jon Tenney and Rebecca Romijn (TV's King and Maxwell) has me exploring Baldacci's books. Hopefully, the show can move beyond the case-of-the-week procedurals and explore the grand schemes unearthed in SPLIT SECOND.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|While the plot was so-so. This movie was very entertaining and i enjoyed it. It's what I needed on a Friday night.  Tom Cruise is back and he is fun in this movie. The lead females actress is also pretty attractive, which certainly doesn't hurt matters. Some good action scenes in the one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great item for a portal page; appreciate that it is a freebie.  The info and the presentation are both exactly right.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Love a good mystery! Characters are interesting & unpredictable - we like that. Just when we think we have it figured out, there's a new twist. We love David Baldacci's characters and how he gives their family history as well as what they're thinking as the story develops. Love his books & will continue to read them!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great cast, writing, wit, emotion.  Nathan Fillion can do it all!  Stana is the perfect foil for Castle.  Great supporting case.  Love every episode.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is EPIC with a capital E but I think it would be better if it was like the computer version you know with villagers,enderman,wolves,redstone,minecarts,iron golems,snow golems,large chests,iron bars zombie villagers,witches,zanite,the nether,mods,skins,automatically generated villages,carrots,saddles you can ride pigs with,the end,the wither,the enderdragon,villagers,wither skeletons,villagers,silverfish,villagers,potions,villagers,emarald,villagers,cats,did I<br />mention villagers  so yeah it be alot<br />better with all that stuff so if you read this mojang pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese make an update thats just like the computer version please please please PLEASE PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE<br /><br />&nbsp;
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Any movie that makes the audience think is a good thing. There was enough action and violence here to satisfy any movie goer as well as that element that makes us question just where we did come from.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Just learning to play carcassonne with this app and it is great. I don't know if im a good natural player but I have won several times agaisnt the computer opponents ... but I don't mind. The game is easy to learn, also the app. I hope one day they upgrade it so one can play online. But so far is excellent.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Magnificently filmed, lush scenery, superb acting, brutal, decadent, depraved society accurately portrayed.  This production takes you back into history and allows you to view the Roman way of life as it truly was.  It will leave you craving for more.
B002VISN9E|5.0|I love this story. I love all of Roald Dalh's stories. I would love to read all of Roald Dalh's books
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Love, adventure, philosophy, India, and black market goods.  My wife also loved it.  Warning: really hard to put down this book.
B000065V42|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid.  The original is usually the best and this is no exception although with this particular series I would also recommend &#34;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&#34; as well.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Very good movie! Watched it with my son, we both enjoyed it. New take on the Hansel and Gretel you read as a child.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|This Movie Was Great&#62;love Every Minute&#62;Everyone Should Watch This Movie&#62;Buy This Movie To Watch&#62;You Will Love This Movie&#62;TWO THUMBS UP&#62;Dave
B001993Y3G|5.0|Arrows and swords always make a great movie. The music was great also. Solid directing and filming. A lot of ways to tell this story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun very time assuming it is a game where you can think and have fun with it at the same time. Also could someone please tell me how to get past 10 please I am also stumped on this level as well. How do you get the key from the glass box in the vent?
B0085YNML2|3.0|this game is ok but it doesent give u enouf expanasion.  that is y i gave it 3 stars. so yeah
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I started a while ago I've been playing for mounths and its never messed up i really recommend it for you
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This is hands down the best show! A lot of chaos in this season and things keep heating up. The cast is great as always and it's sad to know that this show is ending soon. You just know something is going to go down in the next season. I can't wait!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and before they made pocket edition i was waiting for them to make it for tablets i got it on my kindle fire HD as soon as it came out it has never messed up it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app so much it is so fun all ages should definitely get this app<br />This is amazing
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Very good game was looking for a dota style game an  I finally found it keep up the great work and I ant wait to see some new heros
B00BEXB18M|4.0|\\"THIS ALBUM BY MEGADETH GROW'S ON YOU.\\" THE MORE YOU LISTEN TO IT, THE MORE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND! IT SOUNDS COMMERCIAL AT TIMES BUT NOT IN A BAD WAY SAY LIKE THE ALBUM \\"RISK\\" DID. IT HAS SOME HEAVY SONGS ON IT AND SOME COOL GUITAR AND DRUM WORK TOO, AND NOT TO FORGET ELLEFSON KEEPING THE THUNDER ALIVE ON BASS. THE BIGGEST CHANGE HERE FROM SOME OF THE LAST FEW ALBUM'S MEGADETH HAS RELEASED IS DAVE'S SINGING, NOT THAT HE COULD EVER SING VERY WELL ANYWAY'S EXCEPT THAT HE HAS MIXED IT UP A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT HERE IN WHICH I THINK TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD IDEA ANYWAY! LIKE I SAID YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM A FEW TIMES AND THEN YOUR LIKE \\"OH YEAH I GET IT\\" SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT!, BUT STILL KEEPING THAT HEAVY/THRASH MEGADETH SOUND AT THE SAME TIME. MEGADETH'S SUPER COLLIDER HAS SOME REALLY GOOD TRACKS ON IT AND INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS MAY VARY, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE ON THIS ALBUM......SO GO GET IT!
B0047MZUUM|5.0|Love this movie kids can't get enough and the 3D is excellent. I would recommend this movie for the children.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Like I said, this purchase was a total and absolute waste of money AND time that I'll never get back.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|This is probably the best, most comprehensive work on World War II that I've ever read and is loaded with little nuggets of insight and historical detail. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good overview of WWII.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I must admit I had reservations about remakes of movies in 3D.  I grew up with the red/green glasses watching Vincent Price in theaters in House of Wax. Yes I really do go back to 50 cent movies with double features and cartoons and news plus collections for fighting polio.  Was a bit past WWII war bonds at least! 3D back then was fun but hardly made you feel part of the movie.  When Titanic came out in 3D it was first movie in 3D I purchased and I thought it was fantastic.  Then Top Gun came out.  Not quite so good 3D but still very good.  Now Jurassic Park.  I have not watched all the extras but I recommend anyone watch the 3D extra with Steven Spielberg on Disc 1 discussing how Titanic remake made him want to do Jurassic Park in 3D.  Unlike some behind the scenes explanations of how a movie is made watching this before you watch the film will not spoil it for you.  I remember after the Universal Studio tour my wife saying she wished she did not known all the tricks and effects as she could not get them out of her mind when watching a film.  That will not be the case here.  In fact it will make you appreciate even more the 3D effects.  This extra goes through how a 2D movie is converted into 3D and how Spieberg worked with the studio scene by scene to give his input into what he wanted.  The result is probably the best 3D I have seen. While it is not genuine 3D made with 3D cameras  in some ways the result may surprise you and may be even better. The studio and the director can pick out those elements they want to emphasize and enhance in 3D.  Having a master film maker like Spielberg directing the work results in a quality product.  It makes me look forward to more and more remakes in 3D by the studio that did Titanic and Jurassic Park.  With so little TV 3D I have bought numerous DVD's in 3D.  Some are good, some are great and this falls in the latter category.  Give it my highest recommendation for a 3D film. Have on order the new Star Trek movie when it is released in 3D this fall and it will be interesting to see how a made from scratch in 3D movie compares to  a high quality  remake in 3D. I have a sneaky feeling that the methods used in the remake may be even better than had it been made in 3D originally.  We will see.  If you get this one hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The premise is an interesting twist on the woman behind the throne scenario. Instead of lots of weeping and melodrama, this woman gets it together and struggles to keep her family in one piece. The characters are 3 dimensional and plot lines are intelligent. It is a very well written and entertaining TV series.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Entertaining, wonderfully written and filmed.  This is a great reminder of the power of a good story.  For those that know how it ends you will still be holding your breath.  A must see.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I don't watch tv so had not even heard of this show, but have found it very clever and entertaining.  It combines a lot of aspects such as sci/fi, humor, drama, mystery and sentiment.  There is even the hint or promise of romance, but I have only watched six episodes.  I only gave four stars simply because I am not too aware of what else is out there, but I do like this show a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I'm beginning to tire of it, and it seems a bit more soap opera'ish but it's still fun to watch and really fine acting.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Terrible movie. Why would Lucy Lu play in such a film. Put me to sleep. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00CFA227C|4.0|4.3 stars<br /><br />I was halfway into this before I realized how little harsh violence there was. Tons of action, but little of it results in blood and gore. Which is a welcome relief from the constant violence in most movies these days, even kids' films. The script is good, plenty of humor, the acting is solid, especially Hoult and McGregor, and the effects are very convincing.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very pleasant surprise and lots of fun. I'd think it would be perfect for most families, as the fairy tale romance is light fun and the action is too. Other than a few folks falling off the beanstalk and a bunch of giants who get wacked in mostly humorous ways, there's little to squirm at for most kids. Considering what they get on tv now, this is in fact thoroughly wholesome fare.<br /><br />It looks crisp in a good blu-ray transfer, and the extras are slim but ok, including a little game that's ridiculously easy to win, but worth playing, because the \\"prize\\" is a five minute short on the pre-history of the story, a cartoon narrated by the great Ian McShane, the Morgan Freeman of Britain and then some. He might be the best voice-over guy of them all, actually. That short is worth seeing, as it seems like it was the explanatory prequel they made for the film and then decided not to use. If you like McShane and good animation, be sure to play the climb the beanstalk game and check it out, it's quite well done.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|This film is the epitome of old fashion feature films.  The film's atmosphere, scenes, sets, and characters are incredible and believable despite the time period.
B00991TCOG|4.0|The music is energetic. All the songs seem the same, but that can be said for just about all modern music. Since, I am not a music expert I am not going to try to dissect her ability. What I am going to state is that I enjoy her music from the first time I heard her play.<br /><br />Fast shipping and good packaging.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Found myself fast forwarding through the 'fight' scenes as they are much the same as LOTR movies... It's ok for a once view.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great story, kept my attention and didn't want to put it down.<br /> I highly recommend this book to someone who needs a good summer read.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|It is easy to use, sturdy, and slim.  The case fits perfectly and I am very happy with the purchase.
1449410243|4.0|Matthew Inman's books I passed up at first because I figured I could save myself $15 and just read the comics for free on his website. However, after receiving his last book as a gift and enjoying the exclusive book-only comics, I relented and went for this one. Really, I'm also a sucker for preorders and supporting independent comics. There's enough about &#34;How to Tell if Your Cat is Plotting to Kill you&#34; that I can recommend, though this is also the case for most webcomic books; it's handy, in case your internet goes down and you really really need to read a webcomic.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love this series.  The characters seem real and the legal dilemmas are interesting.  I like that the judges all have unique personalities.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I was on a spree of getting hard copies of all the System of a Down albums, but I couldn't find an unedited version of this in stores. It's a good album; not my favorite, but still enjoyable, although the songs can get a little repetitive.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This landed on my Kindle on Wednesday and I almost could not put it down - if it weren't for \\"life\\" I wouldn't have, and so I spent the hours of roughly 7-10 this morning finishing it.  As always with his books, this one is exceptionally well written - with characters who overall each have depth and flaws, and seem very real. In some cases I could have done without such in-depth back stories behind some of the characters, which brought in peripheral characters that were referenced later but that I couldn't recall and had to look up.  Still, this was an excellent read, and well worth my time.  I will be on the lookout for his next one.  Enjoy this bittersweet, tragic tale.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|If you have read the books, this movie is not very good.  As a stand alone movie, it is decent but Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher, too short and can't come close to the character. That being said, the movie has some great action and is well done.  Please get somebody that is taller!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game because I had to really use my brain.  I love to solve things and this was great exercise for my memory.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. Haven't been taken in by a tale in a long time. I'm not a fan of new literature so this was a pleasant surprise. The HBO series follows the first book very well. I read the Kindle edition and found it to be a new and positive reading experience. I gave it four stars out of five because it was hard for me to keep all the many characters straight. I had to go back a lot so the x-ray feature on the Kindle was very helpful. My age range is 40-50 if that helps any with deciding whether or not to purchase this first book in the series.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|After reading and loving Emily Giffin's first novel, Something Borrowed, so much, I was anxious to read the sequel, Something Blue, which highlights the flip side. Again, Giffin didn't disappoint me. Something Blue is a must read after Something Borrowed.<br /><br />Darcy Rhone has sailed through life by using her good looks and smooth charm. Rules? She didn't play by them. And karma? She never worried about it. However, her seemingly perfect life gets flipped up-side-down when she learns her &#34;plain Jane,&#34; good girl best friend, Rachel, has had an affair and fallen in love with her fiance. To add to her predicament, she finds herself pregnant and alone.<br /><br />For the first time, Darcy is struck with the harsh reality that her life has become. While she doesn't fully grasp that her lack of sincerity and 30 years of not playing by the rules has led her to her current situation, Darcy decides to start fresh and flees from her luxurious New York City apartment to London, where she bunks with her childhood friend, Ethan, in his one bedroom flat. When Darcy first arrives in London, she's still very much the superficial Darcy. However, as her pregnancy progresses, Darcy's outlook on life, love, and what truly matters transforms as well.<br /><br />One of the things I love most about Giffin's writing is her ability to characterize the characters of her books so well in addition to highlighting tough life decisions. I made a similar comment in my review of Something Borrowed, but I think it's worth repeating. Giffin makes a subtle case throughout the story that life decisions aren't always black and white. There is a lot of gray area, and sometimes you just have to live life to realize that truth and learn from it.<br /><br />Something Blue was most definitely the other half of Something Borrowed. I was happy to gain more insight into Darcy's point of view, but more importantly, I enjoyed how Giffin tied up the loose ends of Rachel and Darcy's saga. If you haven't already, place Giffin's second novel on your summer reading list so you can find out exactly what is Darcy's &#34;something blue!&#34;
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's a good game except that it takes to long for your energy to grow back so you can continue playing
B008EZVNO0|5.0|year after year Van keeps putting out great music and No Plan B is n exception. Some of the best blues I've heard in a while. Thanks Van for continuing to produce from the heart.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a hit for sure I'm on it almost every day if I could I would give u the money for number 3 hope it comes out soon !
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I think it's really interesting, the acting is really good, the costumes are amazing and each show makes me want to watch more.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Well-written, action-packed, and a lot of fun!  The only criticism I have is the casting of January Jones.  She is a horrible actress and really disrupted the flow of the movie because everyone else was amazing!!!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Works great with the PS3. It took a while to get it all set up, but it played without any glitches.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I really like the graphics it's a fun game I really like the coal car haven't had it long so the coal car is my long run
B00B7Y0206|1.0|tried downloading twice. Everytime it says vtube youtube downloader and viewer (kindle tablet edition) cannot install. VERY ANNOYING. Guess I'm back to using the browser.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing I could not put it down! I highly suggest you to read this book. I am in love
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use this app for when I have to get up in the morning for work and had always been faithful, it is free and worth it to try. Thank You!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|After reading the whole series of the wheel of time, which was over a very long period.<br />It was with a sense of accomplishment that I finally got to read the final Novel in this gripping story.<br />Though I was dissapointed in the final few pages that Rand Al Thor did not get the family and the rewards that he richly deserved.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I do like that they have a well designed app for this, has a lot of versions and audio that reads aloud, book marks phrases, highlighting, etc.., Very Happy Thank You!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Wagner's Ring Cycle was designed as an audio-visual feast and this new Met production brings all elements together in a way that is both marvelously new and fully faithful to his intention. You get the unadulterated storyline, without the slightest hint of irony or reinterpretation, and yet it is bravely futuristic in its use of stage technology. There were apparently problems with \\"the machine\\", the mechanical stage, in live performances, but it works to perfect effect on the video version. The CGI and its ability to interact with human movement - they achieve the impossible here: a man washing the blood off his hands turning the whole river into a torrent of blood, mermaids swimming in a river, gods calling up a rainbow bridge and the ascending on it to their castle in the sky, a fearful flight through a forest, a person on a rock surrounded by molten lava, etc etc. I salute the creators of this masterpiece and give this disk my highest recommendation. I found it so overwhelmingly wonderful that I watched the first disk, Das Rheingold, four times, before starting on the second.<br />These operas are legendarily difficult to sing; at any one time there is only a handful of singers capable of fully realizing Wotan, Brunhilde and Siegfried, each of which has to be on stage for nearly four hours singing a highly complex and subtle musical line over an enormous orchestra. The principles manage it surprisingly well here, given that they are also good actors. And there is an interesting story in the extras for Siegfried, how Jay Hunter Morris was parachuted into the role at literally the last moment; you'd never know - especially in Gotterdammerung, where he gets all the beauty of Wagner's lines.<br />This collection is a visual feast as well as musical and one of the many things to praise is how the opera singers are so suited visually to their roles. the Gods really look like gods, the Germans like Ancient Germans, the Giants like giants. It is probably unfair to single out anyone in this exceptional cast but I do have a few favorites. Stephanie Blythe's Fricka is, I think, the best of the gods, she just simply looks and sounds larger than life. Jonas Kaufmann is a superb hero. Everybody praises Eric Owens for his wonderful Alberich. I particularly love the mermaids, they are so playful, silly and coquettish. But the visual star of the lot and a huge driving force of vocal and visual energy is Deborah Voigh as the indomitable Brunhilde. She is so perfect in the role that it is scarcely believable this is her first time.<br />I love the cinematography: the intimacy of the performances is never lost in the vast stage. And the orchestra is simply glorious. The transcendent beauty of the final sequence in Rheingold is fully realized here. I was transfixed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loved all versions of this game, addicting and great way to kill time, recommend to others to at least try.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|In the early 70s when we were all rocking out and dropping out, here is a man making wonderful music which was not appreciated in the US.  It is amazing how popular he became in another part of the world.  The concerts must have been quite an event.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Like the other versions very nice design and great production. Access your network, play your media or search files, etc.. love this app and it is free, worth the downloading. Thank You!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a WOW factor in the sexual acts department.  It really told the story of how a woman wants to be loved.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Had the item for less than three days when the slider on the side broke off much too easily. It's a fun product but quality wise is slightly on the cheap side.<br />The delivery was extremely fast and great.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I oredered this for a friend of mine who could not find it anywhere! He is so have, he gave me his regular Blue Ray version for free! Nice guy! Very happy!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book. It was honest and genuine and made me feel as if I was living with and experiencing all the emotions that these characters were experiencing.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a fun game however it would be nice to be able to get animals whenever you want not only when the rangers say there's a sick or injured animal. Even though that being said we really enjoy the way the game is all set up haven't figured out how to get more land yet. Also it should be easier to earn more peanuts , not having to buy them all the time. Thanks for your consideration.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was my first game for my kindle so wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find it a great combination of challenge/difficulty.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a cute game enjoyed by both myself and my four year old son. It's fun to play, yet does provide a bit of a challenge.
B008Q0AZVK|3.0|The movies is ehhhhhh.  Glad I watched it tho.  I adore Rob Pattinson so seeing him that much speaking in his natural accent was delightful.
B00009L1TA|5.0|This is the best movie that I have had the privilege of watching in a long time. The twists are unbelievable,but that is the way of life. There are layers of truth and it takes a lot of work to find the whole story and the whole truth. Awesome action and great story. A must see movie.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Nothing to over-analyze:<br />Tons of bad-guys, car wrecks, explosions, bullets, & impossible situations.<br />No doubt about what you're getting - and it's good enough.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|For the so died hard fan of Tolkien, this is an entertaining movie, well done costumes, scenery and battle scenes are thrilling. No cursing or sex scenes too worry about for kids although there violence throughout.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|This is my favorite novel, ever, and I am a writer, so that's saying a lot. Ray Bradbury was a genius.  He tells such beautiful stories in simplistic yet evocative terms, and this novel is a perfect example. You SEE the martian masks, the cities, the crystalline boats as they sail golden sand seas. However, I am extremely disappointed that the editors saw fit to alter this work.  This novel is art and art should never be censored. It speaks of the things that Bradbury and George Orwell feared; censorship and Big Brother. In this novel, there is a chronical called &#34;Usher II&#34; that discusses book burning and censorship!! Yet, the editors decided to remove &#34;Way Up In the Middle of the Air&#34;, an important section of this book.  It uses offensive terms. I understand that. But that section was a snapshot of prejudice from the time period it was written in. To remove it is to forget that kind of thing ever took place, and if we forget, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. Censorship - Ray Bradbury would be appalled. The Editors need to strongly reconsider what they've done and restore this masterpiece to the original version in which is was intended.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I read this book for a book club and was surprised by the fact I was enjoying it. It is a fun, fast summer read that I finished in a day. That being said, there were parts of the book that bothered me. The more I thought about them, the more I questioned why I liked the book. Overall, though, I enjoyed the book enough to want to discuss it with friends, so I will recommend it for that purpose.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful show full of great drama and an interesting storyline.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves drama.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed seeing the prelude to the Wizard of Oz story. I would recommend the movie to friends and family.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Most epics tend to fall short at the end. This book did the series justice and ended well. RIP Robert Jordan.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|is definitely a What If movie! Was happily surprised when I saw it. It is total fiction, but that' okay. Held my interest, but not the best movie I have seen.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Very fun game. Decent controls. Feels kind of like little big planet so its a ton of fun and super cute!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I am re reading this AGAIN Got it for the kindle this time as it is easier for me to see. If I cannot see well that day/night  just turn on the whisper sync (which as a person with MS I may need from time to time)<br />This is one of the scariest books I have ever read. Right up there with Pet Cemetery and Christine and the Shining for me!<br />It started the Vampire genre I believe, but without an Edward/Bella love story.  There is a love story of sorts, though, but much scarier than Bella/Edward's.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Can't wait to follow up with season 6 and then the finale. Its going to be interesting to see how it rolls out
B00000DRYH|5.0|about JOURNEY! Steve Perry is my overall favorite front man. I was lucky enough to see them in concert with Steve as lead three times! This CD brings back memories of those times!  BE WELL STEVE PERRY!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|A fun movie with a well written story line which flows and never bogs down.  Loved the characters and costumes! I am sure we will more of Nicholas Hoult in the coming years.
0385121679|5.0|Love! Love! Bought this to read AGAIN! I had lent it to someone and never got it back and did want to read it again. A must read for any King fan!
B004PYDBVM|5.0|I read this book because I heard that Samaritans purse projected millions of children and people were starving.  I had also read an article on the Internet of a soldiers escape to South Korea and he told about the prisons.  It reminded me of the concentration camps in Germany during WWII only after reading it it seems so much worse.  I was filled with sadness and horror that the world is silent while our fellow mankind suffers so much.  The book was written very well and as difficult as the content is I would recommend this book for all high school students to read as well as all college students .
B0029LCJJS|5.0|one of the best period pieces ever produced on TV. must see- once you start its hard to turn off- it's like reading one of Allison weirs' books
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Equals Greatness. Angry Birds star Wars has all new pissed off birds, with brand new ways to take out the pigs. And you even get to bring in the Millennium Falcon for strafing runs!

B00340O3KQ|4.0|Certainly was action packed, and on that basis we would give it 4 stars, even though the premise of transplanting a face without rejection was not truly believeable.
0345803485|2.0|A BDSM novel about an average woman who piques the interest of an incredibly handsome billionaire--basically, it's literary porn for women. The big problem I have with this book is that the plot consists of an insanely controlling man who admittedly enjoys hurting a young and naive woman. It is emphasized that the context of the relationship is nowhere near being a loving one. The message this book sends to young and innocent readers, or those who have been abused, is that this type of relationship is okay and even normal--when in reality it's anything but.<br /><br />I'm not interested in Book 2 or 3.
B008133MDK|4.0|Very interesting series.  Sherlock in modern times with modern takes on the classic stories.  Very well done and enjoyable. end
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show. I've watched every episode.  If u like war movies & alien movies u will love this one.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  I admit I avoided it early on because I am completely worn out on all things twilight-like but this movie felt very different.
0062059963|5.0|One of the best series of books that I have ever read. If you're looking for romance, this book ha it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a great game. Good story and a nice mix of puzzles and hidden object screens. The hints are very helpful when you get stuck. Worked great on my Kindle Fire!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|A great way to learn about WW guns and my son loves it and a good way for him to learn the safety
B00BXVKKPA|2.0|Maybe I'm minority here. I remember years ago an ACDC interview where they were asked if it was it true that they had made the same album 11 times, they took that question with a lot of humor and replied that it was 12 times, my point here is that ACDC has the right to make the same album over and over again, they were the pioneers in the Aussie Rock and Roll Style we all grew up to love. The truth is that if I want to listen to an ACDC album I'll get an ACDC album not this copycat band version, this is old story many bands through the years have copied another's band style thousands of times with minor or major success, remember Kingdom Come?, well this album is not bad, but is too predictable and forgettable, Airborne has to find his own style, in my opinion is better to be original, no matter if it is good or bad.<br />The guys in ACDC are growing old and in some years there will be no more ACDC, someone has to carry the torch, but do it as an original band.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go back on ACDC catalog, you'll enjoy those albums far way better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm only at level 5 but so far it has been quite challenging, but easy when you work it out. I would have liked a skip option in case I got totally stuck on one level.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love everything he writes an this new book is his best work to date! Excellent for your book club and for the beach.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Team fortress 2 is just like this but this has vehicles never thought a game like this was possible on kindle also its free so yea
B0000DJE9R|5.0|A very satisfying collection for some good memories of a genius. At times a little tricky getting out of the unusual packaging ....which is easily fixable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this game rocks with all the fun animals and the sculptures . I also like scrat its cute how he walks by with his acorn
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Really enjoy this game,lots of fun. Great graphics, easy swipe controls, different directions cause different shots to be played. It is done very swell
B001974DG0|5.0|A very good book. Keeps you interested through<br /> out the entire thing. Crazy twist at the end.<br />Loved it!!! :) <3
B009JZWWGC|5.0|This is a great Start Trek with classic William Shatner over-acting and all. The streaming on Amazon prime was clear and crisp.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|In this world now horror movies are too lame and cartoonish but with the evil dead remake at least it attempts to bring back the old bloody gory horror feeling of the eighties. With a good story and some suspenseful and jumpy and disturbing moments it is extremely effective. Why do people keep comparing to original this is clearly its own film. If you are a horror fan than you will like this one.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|My daughter found this book at the local bookstore and wanted it.  We bought it for her kindle and I started reading it and just couldn't stop. I love this book.  It has so much good information and it brings to light so many issues with our society and also poses some possible answers.  This book is so insightful, yet extraordinarily entertaining.  It is a great read.
0893860468|5.0|&#34;The most important book in the world&#34;  That is quite a statement. Particularly for someone in his late sixties that has been reading all his life.  Nisargadatta comes as close to helping us find our way back as anything I've ever read. I have read this book cover to cover many times and I still cruise through it weekly to remind me of my real search in life.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is such a fun game. My kids love it! It runs very well! I can't step playing it. The challenges are great and not too difficult for kids.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|I also posted this on Netflix:<br /><br />Everyone probably knows what this story is about already and whether they think Chris was perusing a worthwhile goal.  So I will just talk about he movie itself.<br />  First of all it was beautifully paced and shot.  Its style of filling in spaces with narrative and people really made it interesting and absorbing.  It was very worthwhile the whole way through. The people in it were real and I wanted to go live in the desert.  It goes without saying that Eddie Vedder's [[ASIN:B000ULQV0W Music for the Motion Picture Into the Wild]] fits perfectly with this movie and even gives more depth to the actors at times.<br />  Lots of reviewers, from the comfort of their jobs and easy chairs and focusing their thoughts through their own egos, think it is meaningful to judge the worthiness of what Chris did.  This movie does not do that.  But what it does do, in a wonderful way, is to help you understand what he was trying to accomplish and what he was looking for.<br /><br />Note: I think the R rating is pretty unnecessary.  There is drama and hardship in this story, but it is a real story and therefore has meaning.  There isn't anything in this movie that you wouldn't bump into reading about history for example.  Certainly nothing \\"iffy\\" for a person in high school.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I loved Season 1 of Smash. I watched originally on TV and could not wait to see the next episode!  Then I watched season 2 on regular TV and was extremely disappointed with it.<br /><br />Once I had streaming ability I watched Season 1 again and just absolutely loved it! If there is a Season 3 I hope they improve it so it is as good as Season 1!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is easy reading with intense material.  Kyle does an excellent job making you feel like you are in the war zone.  I found it difficult to not think about Kyle's untimely death while reading the book.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|very impressed by this watch when I first got it, very classy and shiny. could or make the movement last at first so I brought it to an experienced watch maker who did something to it at no charge and since then it hasn't stopped moving.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this entire series I saw the television version first and had to read the books and I have not been disappointed
B004OR199G|5.0|This informative book is written in a fresh exciting writing style infused with humor. Kris has a fun outlook on life despite her challenges. But don't be fooled, she has done a huge amount of research and presents a lot of information. For anyone interested in nutrition and lifestyle changes for optimum health this is a must read. She has some very convincing arguments too about veganism and I particularly enjoyed the sections on the benefits do meditation. This book is really for everyone, it can be read purely for fun,as it makes you smile or taken more seriously.  I recommend readers view her documentary too as it shows more clearly her struggle and development of her philosophy.

B00BT1XCOU|5.0|Something New final episode we get to see the mother being revealed and it was Cristin Milioti.  She was an unknown actress who nominated for a tony in Once and also had some acting chops on the sopranos and 30 rock.  Carter Bays the shows creator wanted to pick an unknown actress to play the mother, he found the right girl, it was Cristin and Neal Patrick Harris also agreed with Bays to pick her.  She was the right choice to play the mother.  Milioti is promoted as a series regular, get to know her about what's her name, who she is and how she meets the characters before she meets ted mosby in Farhampton in the finale.  The whole season 9, where the mother will meet the characters before the big finale of meeting Ted Mosby in the train station.  Cristin Milioti gave me an opinion about her, she looks like Alyson Hannigan and Cobie Smulders all at once.  But my opinion, she looks like the daughter on the show who is played by Lyndsy Fonseca.  I saw some pictures of these two, they do look a lot of like.  She also looks like shameless actress Emmy Rossum from the fans opinion.  Through a lot of seasons where ted mosby goes through a million obstacles of finding the one of all the girls he dated before he meets his future wife.  How they saw each other through season 3 to season 8 that all started with a yellow umbrella.  Season 9, will be the final obstacle before ted ties the knot with his future wife.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I had never heard of the orphan trains...another one of America's well kept secrets.  I very much enjoyed learning about this time in American history by reading this well written story.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical novels.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It was historically sound.  Obviously there were some things made up to create a movie, but the characters with which he had to contend with made the movie compelling and the depictions of each of the members of congress who played such am important role were brought out well.  It was well done as only Spielberg can do it.  An important piece of history very American should see.  We need to know our history.<br /><br />The down side of the movie was the sound.  Very poor sound.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Very easy to use. Google tries to find all combinations to locate the requested information. This often gives the searcher too much information. Would like to have the ability to narrow the search and shorten the time finding the information requested.

B000O14VAU|3.0|I saw Underworld streaming through Amazon with no knowledge on the Underworld universe, and my expectations were not high; however, there were some interesting plot points in the film that peaked my interest, most of them surrounding Michael Sheen's character (good acting by the way). It's mostly an action-filled gore fest (which wouldn't necessarily be bad), but it does try to pin a real storyline here, which I'm sure will be explored further in the Underworld sequels. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest either.
0679759328|2.0|Too many words per sentence and paragraph.  Boring book with no excitement at all.  Would not recommend this to anyone.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I was impressed with how many perspectives this author took on this odd subject . This book was a retrospective on a world war against reanimated corpses, capable of infecting others. It went around the world interviewing people from different cultures who had survived. There are footnotes and an index for the jargon and cultural references. A little long, but I was absorbed in this world.

B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I think we all know and it's been established several times that no modern day film will compare to the timeless classic this film is based off. However despite that Oz is a great film for people of all ages. There are so many references to the classic ( Dorothy, witches, poppy fields, emerald city, etc) that older fans will enjoy while younger fans will enjoy the visuals and add ons that were not in the original ( Finely, China Girl, etc.) No matter what anyone thinks this movie is enjoyable and worth a shot.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was quite surprised to see these guys in top form, taking in consideration their age. It seems that they have lost none of their musical prowess and their hard rock bravado, while toning down their old swagger and I-am-a-golden-God attitude somewhat. They have aged well. It's sad that this may be their ultimate epic final performance, their Swan Song.<br /><br />Jason Bonham, whose drum kit and drumming style are nearly identical to his dad's, does his late father proud, outperforming the old man on many of the tracks. Jimmy Page still wields his Les Pauls like battle axes in mythical battles against Norse gods. Robert Plant screeches and wails soulfully like in the days of old, although his voice got a bit weaker, and his stage presence a bit more subdued. John Paul Jones, ever the master-musician, is as serious and dedicated as always, driving the rhythm and doing some exceptional keyboard work.<br /><br />All in all, an elegant, moving performance, enhanced by a giant screen with titanic images, sometimes dwarfing the stage and the band, although the laser and lighting effects are tasteful and never over-the-top. Jimmy plays with his bow inside a laser cone on a supercharged rendition of Dazed and Confused. He conjures up some magic with his Theremin, adding mayhem to the instrumental part of Whole Lotta Love and displays his riff-powered chops on most songs. Although some of his solos come out a bit muddy at times, his chords are heavy enough to make the roof crash. Not bad for a little old man with silver hair! The Stairway to Heaven rendition is indeed heavenly, despite the somewhat botched solo and the overdriven arpeggios (I was hoping he'd use the 12-string neck of his trademark double-neck SG for the arpeggios). I guess having played the song so many times, he tries to play it a little differently each time. Kashmir, in all its towering symphonic majesty, is as perfect as the Taj Mahal or the Himalayas themselves. Black Dog has as much bite as it ever did, and The Song Remains The Same takes the band through the changes at a spectacular pace.<br /><br />It's sad that a few key songs did not make the setlist - I would have loved to see Moby Dick, The Ocean, Over The Hills And Far Away, The Immigrant Song and All Of My Love re-created live, but they had to make some tough choices. No Quarter, Nobody's Fault But Mine, The Song Remains the Same, In My Time of Dying and Trampled Under Foot sort of make up for it.<br /><br />I could go on raving for a long time, so I will conclude by saying that it's a great performance, one of the highlights in Rock history. A must have for any Zeppelin fan.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ok, so those of you who are actually reading this listen. If you don't like the game then here's some advice. Play this game ONCE more, then go Download the PC version and play that once. Then come back to this game and repeat Until you understand that this is basically the same game. Now, to those of you who did read this, I salute you, to those of you who didn't, you must like this game.
B003QP4NPE|3.0|I was really excited to read this book since I have seen a lot of raving reviews of just how great this book is, but I feel that it did not live up to my expectations. The idea of an IT genius enacting a diabolical plan after his death through the internet was quite intriguing and I was more than eager to figure out how it all ended (if it even did). However, I felt like this book was more about blowing people up than anything else. I kept wanting to feel some sort of progress with the story line, but it seemed as though it was never really moving, it felt very static. I do get that is is the computer geeks Bond novel, which is fine, I was just expecting more (and I do understand that for all the IT guys out there that this book is pretty spot on technologically but a story needs more than just tech, it needs some sort of resolve and this novel does not have one). I guess if I really want a conclusion then I need to read Freedom, which I do plan on doing since I did enjoy this book.

B00BF11UM0|3.0|I thought this was the story of the SEAL Team storming the bin Laden compound. It was mainly a story about the intelligence gathering that led up to the raid. In particular, it was about one woman's crusade to get the hard headed government to follow up on her lead. Only the last few minutes of a really long movie were about the raid itself. There was no focus on the SEAL, their tactics, their emotions, their stories, or anything like that. If that is what you are expecting, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The movie itself gave me a visual of military life both on the intelligence side and the hard reality of living on site in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That was interesting.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the main character is so hard and disconnected from herself, emotions, and other people that it is a plot driven movie. There is nothing and no one to care about or identify with. It felt like watching a news story rather than living a human story. Nothing wrong with that, but it isn't that appealing to me personally. You may like it better.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|This is a pretty good kindle emulator but it's not perfect. First, it sometimes loses synch. When that happens you have nothing to read. I dread this happening in the middle of a trip to Europe. Second, it has annoying ergonomics is some instances. If you press the back key while ANYWHERE on the actual Amazon Kindle site it throws you all the way back to the original application. You have to use a special back arrow at the top of the page. Finally, the kindle store has become a real problem as it shows tons of cheap junky books that have clearly gotten fake reviews. Don't know how to weed these out but you can buy a lot of crappy books if you aren't careful.<br />Rgrds-Ross
0143038095|5.0|First read this book years ago and still find myself going back to these mother-daughter stories.  My first copy is marked up with various colors for each character to help me remember which daughter paired with which mother.  Heart-stopping stories of what would you do if put into amazingly challenging situations that the mother's all had to make.  The champion chess player who defies her mother and the woman whose husband divides all of the expenses &#34;evenly&#34; (I once dated a similar man).  Family at its heart and how to find our way. Wonderful book for any mother or daughter.
B007SGM084|5.0|Beyond what you've heard. I enjoyed reading the trilogy. I realized, after getting through the first 1 1/2 books I set them to the side for a while and picked them up again never losing thought of what I read. As there is a main thread throughout, but then the story emerged.....  ;-) enjoy

0545123275|5.0|I think Shiver is the most surprising book I've read all year. For years I have seen Shiver literally everywhere: bookstores, libraries, Goodreads, book recommendations, and so many other places. Yet despite the fact that Shiver is a literary sensation, I wasn't too interested in picking it up. I was kind of afraid of not liking it and being disappointed due to all the hype. Shiver surprised me completely and exceeded all expectations I had for it. This book is one of the most moving and emotional novels I've read in such a long time.<br /><br />  Shiver is the story of Grace and Sam who meet under extremely unpleasant conditions. Grace has always watched Sam in the forest with his yellow eyes. One day Grace meets Sam in human form and everything changes for better or worse. Sam has to struggle to fight the wolf inside of him to be with Grace and it's not going to be easy.<br /><br />  Shiver is unlike any paranormal book I've ever read and probably will ever read. It tosses out everything you know about werewolves like the full moon, how silver is their weakness, etc. Instead of using the classic mythology, Stiefvater creates her own new rules that govern the werewolves and their ability to shift. They can't shift on command or shift only on the full moon like most werewolves in the media.<br /><br />  Maggie Stiefvater's Shiver is beautiful, emotional, and truly heart-breaking. At the end of the audiobook I was listening to, Stiefvater said she wrote Shiver to make readers emotional and cry. I felt like Stiefvater wrenched my heart out and shattered it a thousand times. The last time I was so attached to characters in a novel was Clockwork Princess and that ended in a waterfall of tears. Maggie Stiefvater turned me into an emotional wreck and she plays with a reader's emotions at so many points in this book.<br /><br />  The protagonists, Sam and Grace, are two characters I got extremely attached to. I felt this connection with them and I understood how they feel and why they acted the way they did. I definitely think it's because I'm kind of a mixture of both Sam and Grace. Rarely is an author truly appeal to capture what being a teenager is truly like and the cavalcade of emotions that flood through you. Stiefvater hit the bull's eye with her chapters from Sam's POV and they sounded exactly how a guy would think. Grace's chapters were distinctly different from Sam's yet they were also executed perfectly. I loved Grace's snarky attitude and humor which contrasted Sam's more serious, grave situation. Stiefvater helps the reader understand why Sam and Grace act the way they do with their rich, developed backstories. I think a writer has succeeded writing a fantastic novel, when the reader can empathize with the writer's characters. I didn't just empathize with the characters, I felt like I was living through the pages feeling Sam and Grace's pain, love, and joy. It sounds crazy but it's so true.<br /><br />  Authors can't only write fantastic protagonists, they have to write also superb supporting characters. Stiefvater created such an interesting bunch of supporting characters and I also felt this tugging connection to them. The supporting characters were so lifelike and they reminded me of people I went to highschool with. Even though Stiefvater makes her characters read like high school students, she manages to avoid all the cliches that usually come with these types of characters. Stiefvater even made characters who didn't seem so likeable like Isabelle Culpepper evolve and change into characters I admired.<br /><br />  Stiefvater's writing style is very poetic and helps the reader immerse the reader into the world of Mercy Falls. Her descriptions are well-written and helped paint vivid pictures in my mind of what was happening. Stiefvater knows how to write a compelling story and she left me longing for more of Sam and Grace. I felt this need to immediately pick up Linger and Forever, and read them back-to-back.<br />  Shiver is a deep, emotional, profound novel that I could read again hundreds of times and I probably would find new things to obsess over each time. This book perfectly explores what it means to be human and how easily our humanity can be torn away from us. Shiver is a thought-provoking, and meaningful novel that is nothing at all like Twilight despite the fact that the two books are constantly compared. This is a book that I probably wouldn't have appreciated years ago when I first saw it in stores, I'm glad that I read Shiver at this point in my life. I could re-read this book many times in the future and I definitely can imagine doing so.hiver is a deep, emotional, profound novel that I could read again hundreds of times and I probably would find new things to obsess over each time.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|Classic film continues to be one of the best ever made.  Bogart and cast are awesome and movie is over before you know it.
B008JFUPLC|5.0|I remember seeing Monsters Inc. in theaters when it first came out. I was absolutely obsessed with it and it was one of the best family movies I had ever seen. Fast-forward a couple of years and I heard news that there was going to be a prequel to Monsters Inc. I'll admit it that I was pretty skeptical and I didn't really see the need for a prequel. I had thought that a prequel was kind of ridiculous because Monsters Inc. could be a perfect stand-alone. After seeing Monsters University, I realized how essential it is to the viewer that we get the backstories of Mike, Sulley, and Randall.<br /><br />  Monsters University has proven to me that Pixar can still make amazing, emotional films. Cars 2 was one of the most disappointing movies I had ever seen and I was worried that somehow Pixar would botch Monsters University. Monsters University is a fun movie that the whole family enjoy and it's impossible not to be entranced by this touching story. MU hits all the right notes and is not only emotional but it's also an extremely entertaining film. I loved watching Mike and Sulley slowly develop into the characters that I loved in Monsters Inc. It was also interesting to see how much Randall transformed from the beginning of MU to the end. I definitely would have liked to see more of Randall and how MU changed him.<br /><br />  Even if you aren't familiar with Monsters Inc., Monsters University is still a treat! With it's stunning visual animation, spot-on acting by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, laugh-out-loud humor, and touching moments, it's impossible not to become a fan of the franchise. If you go in to MU, without seeing Monsters Inc. I'm almost 100% positive that you'll want to see Monsters Inc. right afterwards. Monsters University is definitely a noteworthy movie and it was well-worth the 12 years or so wait. Pixar has out-done themselves once again and I can't imagine them making another movie like Cars 2 ever again after seeing MU.<br /><br />  Could there be another Monsters Inc. film? There very well could be even though Monsters University wrapped up nicely. I would love to see another Monsters Inc. movie only if it's executed well. Pixar stills knows how to make a terrific movie that people of all ages will love. I'm so excited to see what Pixar has in store next and I hope I enjoy it as much I enjoyed MU. I'd highly, highly recommend seeing MU and it surpassed any expectations that I had for this prequel. I definitely plan on seeing it again once it releases on DVD.nother Monsters Inc. film?

B008220BLG|5.0|Ah, &#34;Warm Bodies,&#34; how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways ...<br /><br />Zombies are pretty much our catch all metaphor these days.  &#34;Warm Bodies&#34; makes it easier as it uses it's zombies as metaphors for, well, everyone else.  &#34;R&#34; is our protagonist's name.  He doesn't remember his name, just that it starts with an &#34;R.&#34; His thoughts are completely coherent but he's unable to move those thoughts into words and actions because he's young and naive and awkward.  Also, because he's a zombie.<br /><br />Then he meets Julie, the prettiest girl this zombie's seen since he became a corpse.  Granted, when they meet she's on a mission to kill corpses and R does eat her boyfriend's brains.  Still, though, she's AWESOME.  It doesn't hurt that as R eats her boyfriend's brains he gets to see his memories of her.  For an unexplainable reason, R saves Julie from the zombies and takes her back to his place, where she digs through his record collection and realizes they like the same thematically relevant power ballads.<br /><br />This really is a zombie movie as seen by someone like John Hughes.  R knows what to do to get the girl, he's just incapable of knowing how to do it.  He's awkward, clumsy, ineloquent but it's obvious, especially to her, how hard he's working to connect.  Is the power of love so great that it can turn zombies human?  Well, you'll have to see the flick to learn that for sure.<br /><br />It's not all love and &#34;Bat Boy,&#34; though as Julie and R spend time together.  There are zombies like R that look mostly human and are slow and go through the motions of their old lives but there are also really nasty zombies that are just skeletons and are much more predatory.  They ignore zombies but sniff out heartbeats from a mile away.  Julie's dad is also the leader of the militant human reistance against the corpses and he seems a lot more interested in mowing down the critters than he does in learning they might be redeemable.<br /><br />R is played by Nicholas Hault with a slow drawl, a few twitches and bright blue eyes that don't dilate but are still kind of handom'ish.  I mean, for a zombie.  What the movie expertly plays at is how oftentimes in romance movies, especially about young romance, how much the protagonist can be something of a cypher.  It's not what they're about, as much as people can lay their own selves overtop them and live the movie through them.  As R has had most of his life and personality stripped away, he becomes any of us.<br /><br />Teresa Palmer's Julie makes it easier. She's just right: amazingly pretty but not too much, she's a little bit rugged, a little bit cute but you still get the sense she can move if the right song were playing in the world.  And of course she's perfectly open-minded and idealistic.  Girls like her in movies usually are.  It's what makes so many geeks fall in love with them.  It would probably be needlessly mean to call her the anti-Kristen Stewart, warm and engaging and full of life.<br /><br />The great Rob Corddry is around as R's best zombie friend.  They grunt and moan at one another on a regular schedule and as R starts to change, so does Rob.  He also gets the best one liners, a good thing since he can only speak in them.  Julie has a best friend too, Nora, played by  the splendid Analeigh Tipton, who was equally lovable last year as the babysitter in &#34;Crazy Stupid Love.&#34;  She's the sassy one.<br /><br />&#34;Warm Bodies&#34; never tries to become more than its own fairy tale, &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; riff.  There's a balcony scene even, for Pete's sake.  It works from top to bottom because it's honest and funny and the right actors are playing the right characters.  It's a marvelously joyful and optimistic romantic story.  It's also a lot of fun.<br /><br />There are a million movies about decent people turning into soulless, blood-soaked zombies.  But one about soulless, blood-soakes zombies turning into people again?  It doesn't get any more romantic than that.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The discs and case and slipcover were all in near perfect condition. No visible wear or scratches. The Lion King is a great movie.
B005GQ5HB0|5.0|Don't be fooled by the length - this is a heavy read! It is thematically rich. It deals with; first love, forgiveness, ignorance, generational guilt and the past in a sensitive and objective manner. How does love cloud our judgement? How do you truly forgive? Can someone be held culpable for their actions if they operated from a place of ignorance? How long must we carry the guilt of the past? The book doesn't give you answers to these questions but it sure will have you thinking about them long after you've turned the last page.

B004TI5N38|5.0|The basic premise is the same...you'll find out when you read this great author. In my opinion this is a &#34;guy&#34; book but I so enjoy all of Baldacci's books and have read them all. He does his homework re research where necessary.

B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Well it has marbles which is a good start but it gets one star for the GPS stuff. There's plenty of free clones of this very game out there without the GPS requirement. In fact I haven't felt this dirty playing a board game which involved balls since that stalker I picked up at the marbles match. This game with the GPS tracking is about the same.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|We loved the movie, however, it cut out just before the end.  This has happened with Amazon a number of times and is very disappointing.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever. On re-watching it, there were of course things that I hadn't noticed before. Almost all of those things were positive. There's probably a whole political argument about this movie. Both for and against, most likely. But I don't want to trouble myself over such matters. I want to enjoy the music and the acting and singing.<br /><br />I will say this: young Liam Neeson in this movie makes me think about Qui Gon Jinn and how cool it would have been if the prequels were centered around him and not stupid Anakin Skywalker. But that's all I want to say about that.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|The actors portray the characters superbly, some broken but highly functional, everyone manipulative and out for their own interests be them laudable or otherwise. One must watch the series however as each builds upon the previous.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Flow Free is fun! I downloaded it one night when I couldn't sleep and it kept me up way past my bedtime.

B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is so worth the $ but there is one bad thing about it I can not listen to my music well because there is no settings
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show is so exciting and emotional. It has a great storyline that just keeps getting better and better. I hope it lasts for quite a while
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! Late watching it but caught up in 2 weeks with all three seasons! Can't wait for season 4!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I cant wait for season 4. I love shows about this era and in Britain. Truly a masterpiece of a show.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I am fairly new to playing games on a tablet and am not looking to spend any money on these types of games.  I do appreciate fantasy games and am trying to get used to twin stick top down games, which led me to Eternity Warriors 2.  Having played it only a few times, I am amazed at the quality of the game for being free and am certainly having fun playing it!  If you're looking for a free game that's tons of fun, you can't go wrong with Eternity Warriors 2!
B008R6MI8G|5.0|Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman really make this film live, if you're into Irish history watch then this film is for you
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|A must watch for those couples who are pushing 40 and have been in a long term relationship! This hilarious movie hits the spot on issues that couples face in a stale marriage whose children have become the center of their lives!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great book. As expected Baldacci does it again. Am now reading his latest novel - The Hit, which so far is excellent. One of my favorite authors
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Somehow, this app helps me asleep quicker with the city sounds, plus a time option to auto close, it's perfect

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|not a dull moment; twist and turns that will kept you on the edge of your seat; very, very computerized; make believe stunts;and a surprising fanale.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|Nothing like a little camera shaking to make the audience seasick, right? It's a shame I had to pay ten bucks to see that, especially since I can read fan-fiction online for free.

B00CKZX0AA|4.0|Music like this is great in the background while doing work.  I like Hans Zimmer music.  I like this album because it has so many tracks.  I mix this up with the music from the Pirates of the Caribbean albums.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I didn't think the concept would work, but it does.  Apparently it's possible to make a very nice zombie romantic comedy.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Recommended.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|I love listening to movie soundtracks like this in the background while I work.  I really like the music here, except for the last track, The Growl.  It's really out of place with the rest of the album.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I'm still partial to the original!! However, my children really enjoyed the show. The graphics were pretty amazing :-) I even laughed a few times right along with them ;-)
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds is about the only game that I've found that can keep my attention for any length of time. And besides who doesn't like Angry Birds!!
B0084ANCBC|3.0|I read this because it is a classic and I want to be well read. I honestly liked the story but all the commentary and asides from the author made it harder to read. I do feel it is worth the read but it makes you work for it.
0062059963|5.0|The competition is heating up. America is part of the Elite, meaning there are a smaller number of women competing for Prince Maxon. But then comes along Aspen, America's first love. Now America has to decide -- does she chooes the Prince leading to a glamerous life and a new, exciting love -- or does she choose Aspen, her first love? You have to read this book to find out!<br /><br />This was a wonderful sequel. It kept me turning pages all night; I couldn't put it down! The only disappointing part was that the ending left me with more questions than answers, and I have to wait a year until the final book of the trilogy. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys romance, action, mystery, and just an overall wonderful read.<br /><br />http://bookaholic16.blogspot.com/
B005KR6OB2|5.0|What a &#34;super&#34; collection, no pun intended. Catching up on all the shows we missed. One of our favorite shows all time.
B000SZK41M|5.0|The first of the series, it was always the best...as old as it is, I can't believe Amazon Prime doesn't make it free, however...
0783235380|5.0|This is a really good movie, I love Sandra Bullock she is a great actress, she makes the movie great
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is similar to 100 floors.  After completing 100 floors, this one seemed easier.  I've only done a few levels, but each one seems to have another layer of difficulty.  I enjoy playing this game.  I had to get the answer book for 100 floors....hope I can think this one through without the cheat sheet!  Recommend!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Great change up on two old classics, Shakespeare and zombies.  A surprising twist in the middle revealing the former.  Comical in small ways.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game entertains me for hours when there is nothing to do. I give it a five star rating because the actions are realistic and amazing
B00D6OV57O|5.0|I haven't heard an orchestral movie score this good since Gladiator. I saw the movie and the soundtrack stood out as much, to me, as the well directed movie
B00884GR0W|5.0|Great game. It is just like minecraft but it is better. It has more items, weapons, and it even has cars jet packs and diving suits. That is why I rate block story 5 stars.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This application functions well and serves it's purpose. I would definitely recommend this kindle app to anyone who enjoys Pinterest.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was very cool.  I loved the book this is my third time reading it and I still love it.  For those who have not read it yet I would.  :  )
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I am a Doctor Who fan. Even like the silly ones. And I enjoyed how season 6 foreshadowed season 7.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I chose this rating because the words aren't always correct  and there were odd symbols randomly. I do love the three books. I recommend this to people who enjoy the \\" cliff hangers\\" or things you don't expect.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome job with this game. Not to hard or easy. Can hardly wait for the next levels. Hopefully real soon.
B003GDYN24|4.0|This is a pretty good release from Kelis. I've heard all of her work, and this would have to be my favorite album of hers as a whole. I love Dance music (House, Club, Disco, Trance etc) and from beginning to end it contains elements from each of these genres with more of an Electronic(a) twist. This album, to me, has a very British and/or Euro-pop sound, and it would make sense considering some of it's producers (David Guetta, Benni Benassi) to name a few. Although, not the best Dance music producers of the region, in my opinion, I still think they did a fine job in piecing this project together. Cathy Dennis stops by for a split second in the iTunes Bonus track &#34;Carefree American&#34;, which is one the hottest numbers of the Flesh Tone Sessions, if you ask me, and I'm not sure why it isn't on the standard tracklist.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this album is some of Kelis' pitchiness, especially in the opening track. Some of her singing can come off a bit whiney, and overwhelming. I think &#34;Intro&#34; should've been rerecorded to make it the best it could be, vocally. Yet and still, and overall, this album is very listenable. While the entire album is strong, &#34;Fourth of July&#34; is definitely leading the pack with it's loud, buzzing synths, and deep electro arrangements. I would love to see if Kelis could do it all again, releasing another Dance focused album, because I really enjoyed this...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great and all with the 0.7.1 update coming out bringing it one step closer to the real Minecraft for PC and did you know that it's also for Xbox
B006MGDVIY|5.0|This was a referral from a friend. I was never a fan of racing but this movie isn't like that. It's heartbreaking and captivating. A must watch.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Fun!!!<br />Awesome game to play and also addictive<br />Easy to play and also fun<br />The wonder zoo is the best game I have ever played.
0870703781|5.0|Did you really think it would be anything else? I mean its William Eggleston's... Making the mundane exciting is what he is best at.
B004GF244K|5.0|George Harrison is truly missed.  He was a large part of my life, in music; in spiritualism; in humor.  The Beatles underused him miserably, and though I am a major Beatles fan, I can't help but wonder how much better even they might have been by allowing a little more Harrison to intermingle with the Lennon McCartney mystique.  This is a concert FOR George, of course, and so his performances aren't here.  But somehow he IS here.  This is a wonderful get together of his closest friends, sending off their beloved George in a way that George truly and honestly would have wanted.  On vivid display is his love of Indian culture and music; his sense of humor and love of the python camp; and finally his rock and roll side with incredible renderings of most of his greatest work.  It is all done in great love without sappiness, and is in the end greatly uplifting, and truly a celebration of a life, rather than a dour and sad event.<br /><br />Most important.....to ANY fan of music, and particularly live music....this is the best concert DVD/BLURAY ever produced and must now become the standard by which all other concert videos by anyone must be compared and judged.  Kudos to all involved in the camera work, production, sound, engineering and all.  It doesn't hurt to have such great subject matter, of course, by I can't help the feeling that this video itself was made with love.  Love for us.  The fan and consumer.<br /><br />You must have this concert film if you love music.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Of Monsters and Men is such a great band and My Head is an Animal is their best album. I love the songs: little talks, six weeks, and from finner. They all possess extraordinary musical talent and I believe they are the best folk pop to come around in a long time. A must have
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Like all great wisdom, James's ideas are simple yet profound.<br /><br />In addition to visionary insights that will shift the way you view yourself and your possibilities, \\"Choose Yourself\\" also offers insanely brilliant practical advice for getting yourself unstuck. You'll not only scrape yourself off the floor, you'll soar to new heights that you've sensed were possible, but couldn't quite figure out how to achieve.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|Purpendicular was too proggy, Abandon was too straightforward rock, Bananas was too commercial and Rapture of the Deep, though the best of these four IMO, lacked a definite direction. Now What is a nice combination of all four albums, hopefully keeping the best and avoiding the rest. This is a good album either if you take each song separately, or  if you take the whole album which visits many musical territories successfully. Well, of course not another Machine Head or even Perfect Strangers, but taking the general lack of creativity in the current musical industry into consideration, this is a gem!
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|Just finished watching \\"Quartet\\" with Maggie Smith and a wonderful cast. The music alone was \\"worth the price of admission\\" !!! The most enjoyable movie I've seen in a while. If you see it, stay through the credits and you'll learn a little about some of the actors!! One more thing, the subtitle should be \\"Growing old isn't for sissies!\\" Filmed in England and the photography is wonderful - wish *** I *** could grow old on those grounds.  It's even educational - never thought I'd hear an intelligent comparison of opera and rap but it's in this movie!!!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It's good fun but to buy coin it's out of price and its a great game they should make the slots for free
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really really REALLY like this came because you go around eating fish and people and sometimes other sharks! It's pretty cool!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Write your review here.<br /><br />What did you think go the book?<br />Who would you suggest this book to?<br />Why did you rate this book what you did?
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie had soooooo many details missing.  I loved the book so much that I was amazing eager to see the movie.  I should have known better--you cannot always convert a masterpiece.  The movie was awesome, and the only reason I have any qualms may be perhaps because I read the book first.<br /><br />The movie is quite entertaining, but I must tell you that as awesome as it may be, it doesn't begin to scrape the imagination the book evokes.  And yes...because I had first read the book, I totally cried when about Rue  because I got it.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|The tables are well thought out and fun to play. I just think you should let us play more than one table without paying for them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was slow in the beginning, but once I got further into it, it turned out to be excellent. I could not put it down.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I enjoyed the film as did our 2 young daughters. Thought it was cleverly done w/ just the right amount of scary. Reminiscent of the original with the exaggerated animation & color extremes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great site for keeping likes and ideas especially when in a hurry and want to have it got later,  app works great!
0345803485|5.0|I just finished reading the first volume of the 50 SHADES OF GREY trilogy. Is there anything about this hugely popular book that has not been said already? Probably not, but I will take a stab at it.<br /><br />As a child, I read Grimm's fairy tales, Hans Christian Anderson, and similar tales. I read stories about princes and princesses. Sometimes the princess would never smile, or was trapped in a tower. Sometimes the prince would rescue the princess; sometimes the princess would rescue the prince. \\"Cinderella,\\" a beautiful and sweet child abused by a wicked stepmother and forced to dress in rags and sweep the floor until the prince finds that the slipper fits her foot and rescues her. The princess who kisses the frog enchanted by a wicked witch and he turns back into a prince. These and many other stories were told and retold through many cultures over centuries because they told tales that reflected real life patterns of human life. They refer to topics such sex and violence, but packaged in a fashion that people of various cultures considered suitable for children to encounter and learn about.<br /><br />As I grew older, I encountered books with more explicit and \\"adult\\" themes and language. Such tales can be found in \\"Western\\" culture and in other cultures. When my parents were young, D. H. Lawrence's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER was the shocking story of its time, a tale where a sexually frustrated noblewoman finds a kind of fulfillment in a liaison with a \\"lower class\\" gamekeeper. When I was an introverted timid young adult I was titillated and in a way \\"educated' by books such as ETERNAL FIRE and PROVIDENCE ISLAND by the novelist and screen writer Calder Willingham. As I read PROVIDENCE ISLAND, half way through, I thought to myself, \\"This is a \\"fairy tale\\" written as an adult novel with adult themes. Later, I read Erica Jong's FEAR OF FLYING, a novel that was a similar breakthrough for woman. Nevertheless, one can find similar literary revolutionary works from hundreds and thousands of years ago. MOLL FLANDERS, SONG OF SOLOMON, TALE OF GENJI, etc.<br /><br />So I regard 50 SHADES as the latest in an ancient tradition of fairy tales and adult explicit shockers. As an unapologetic atheist, I am wryly amused that the naughty hero is named \\"Christian.\\" I can imagine that for a young person just discovering sexuality, the explicit sex provides a sex manual for our modern no secrets time. Anastasia, the shy, virginal, bookish editor is a modern \\"frozen princess\\" who needs to be freed by the sadistic, dominant Christian. But wait! Handsome, accomplished, ultra skillful Christian is really also a prisoner of an abusive childhood.<br /><br />So welcome to a dirty fairy tale for 2013.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|I had reservations about this flick due to the negative reviews.It was purchased for me for fathers day,so I watched it.<br />Well kids it is better than the \\"pro\\" reviews.<br />It is entertaining,and the cgi is awesome.<br />The film is well acted,yet a bit corny at the same time.But remember this is a fairy tale we all grew up with.<br />Definatley worth a look,even on a rental
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Well worth watching. Downey is great.  A truly enjoyable adventure, action film.  The special effects are great as are the other visuals.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Kind of lost my attention a little.  Great for the younger teens.  Maybe that's why it lost my attention.  Not sure if I will continue the series.
B002RXVOX0|3.0|Sadly, some of the other reviewers are right.  The color has been drained out of the movie to the point that it's nearly black and white.  It doesn't go at all with the sumptuousness of the obviously ornate scenery.  It ruins any contrast between the land of the living and Dracula's world. It also made it very hard to see what was going on in places.  I liked what the writers did with Lucy.  She's much stronger than most other female leads of the period and Frank Langella's Dracula was very interesting to watch.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere was so drab that it really took away from the story.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Getting all the movies for this price was awesome, and on Blu-ray is an even better deal!! My husband loved it for his birthday.
B00AWKZSNM|1.0|When I first got it I was able to set it up and my iPad and IPhone were connecting to it.  I tested a couple of movies on  both and they worked great.  The next day I tried using it and I was not able to connect to it, I tried several times and nothing, not at home and not at work.  I was so looking forward to this working so i did not have to have the movies downloaded to my iPad or iPhone, but to no avail.  I ended up returning it for full refund, still looking for an option.  And I think it will end up going for a Surface or Dell tablet instead of iPad, not having the ability to connect a usb drive is really bad, after the years it is getting to be a pain and since other hardware companies are coming up with comparable equipment I think I am jumping from the Apple bandwagon and looking elsewhere, besides, with Jobs gone I think the creative soul of Apple is gone anyway and we will not get anything earth shattering anymore from them, hope they prove me wrong though.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is a fun game.  only a few things would I change. It is a continuous game so it is very addicting.
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|This is a great processor for the price with &#34;video card&#34; included, runs games pretty well as good as heavy multitasking.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this game to relax, after dinner and the dishes are done.  The games are quick and easy.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Memphis is without doubt one of the best albums from Boz Scaggs in decades and proves he remains one of the finest singer-songwriter musicians of our generation. Every song elicits a warmth and smoothness that is relaxing and makes you feel good about being alive. Some things really do get better with age and the genius of Boz is among them.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My niece played this game on a road trip to Disney.  She would play until the battery was dead and bug me to know if it's charged yet, so she can play again.  She sure got the score way up there!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is only my 15th Van Morrison album out of the 35 studio-produced in his career, but it proves he truly was born to sing, write songs and play music. It seems as if all of the experiences of a life well lived by the boy from Belfast comes through on this CD as every cut brings you closer to the genius of Van the man. I just hope we don't have to wait so long for his next album.
0345803485|5.0|I ejnoyed this Book. Every Woman should read it. I got all three. No woman should be controlled this way
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This was a very interesting read. The main character, Det Corey is a funny guy. Good drama, fast paced, excellent story. Recommend you read this.
0345803493|5.0|I looked forward to this book to continue the story.  If you can get past the spicy language and the spicy sex scenes then it is a great love story.  Already got the last book and I am reading it quickly...it is hard to put down as were the others.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I am using this video using a Samsung 3D receiver and LG 47 &#34; 3D TV. The movie is absolutely gorgeous when viewed in 3D. I realize that 3D TV's have pretty much flopped but I still would do it again. What is needed is for the price of the videos to come down and use 3D more often when filming these movies in the first place. The selection of 3D movies is limited at best and there needs to be a lot more of them.
B007HO392S|1.0|She is Skank Trash!!!<br />Yuck! Skank! Screaming ... what ever happened to real singing.<br />Country Music has so gone down hill and this skank single handedly made it happen.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is a great movie in 3D and my granddaughter loves it. Just be sure you buy the right 3d version for your system. All the modern systems are 3D as is mine.
B000000Y26|1.0|The quality of this pressing was very poor in terms of both surface noise and distortion (double checked against the digital version to be sure that the distortion wasn't just in the original recording). Returned this for a refund.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I have a hard time putting the game down. I would like more levels to the game.
1601251505|5.0|I had been playing Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition, and felt that the complexity and depth of the system was sometimes lacking from what I might desire. Pathfinder is a much more robust system, and I enjoy playing it both as a GM and a PC.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I'm a huge fan, and J. Cole delivered just like I thought he would! I've had it on repeat since I downloaded it
1452000255|5.0|I received this book from the Author in exchanged for an honest review. Peter: A Darkened Fairytale is bound to be a classic. William O'Brien draws you into the world he has created that you feel like you are part of the story. It was The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe mixed with Alice in Wonderland all rolled into one.  It was exciting and kept me on my toes. A must read.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|So far, so good...this case seems to protect the phone. With this case on though you cannot put your phone on a docking station or hook it up to a USB in the car.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book was long and drawn out. The only one worth reading was the first in the series. The end.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|ONE OF THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME 80'S MOVIES STARRED A YOUNG HOT TOM CRUISE. TO SEE HIM PARADE AROUND IN HIS TIGHTY WHITEYS STILL MAKES THE MOVIE AS FRESH AS IT WAS OVER 25 YEARS AGO. ANOTHER TIMELESS CLASSIC.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The acting was excellent.  Sean Penn should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance.<br />There was almost non stop action and the period props and clothing really made one feel the era.<br />Although there were lots of shootings and the opening sequence is a shooker there was very little visual blood.<br />All in all a pretty good movie....better than most.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|STILL YET ANOTHER TEEN 80'S MOVIE ABOUT GROWING UP. THE CLASSIC DANCING NUMBER OF TWIST AND SHOUT MAKES THIS MOVIE A MUST SEE. MATT WAS A HUNK BACK THEN, AND STILL LOVE SEEING HIM AS FERRIS. HOW ABOUT A SEQUAL 30 YEARS LATER?
1427217521|3.0|I love listening to books that are full of action and suspense as they usually don't have a problem of keeping my attention.  I can't say that was the case for A Prisoner of Birth though.  I think I even missed a bit of the beginning, although it didn't take long to come to the conclusion that someone was murdered and Danny was being framed for the crime.<br /><br />Danny is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit and learns quickly what he must do in order to survive on the inside.  He meets some good friends during his imprisonment and he even makes some decisions that help to shape him into a better person. When certain events happen Danny decides to seize the opportunity and take control of his future.<br /><br />It is a long road for Danny as he seeks revenge on those that are responsible for his imprisonment.  He takes his time as everything falls into place for him, allowing the true perpetrators to create their own demise.  Once you get to a certain point of this audiobook you can't stop as we need to know how Danny is getting his revenge on these men!<br /><br />This was an interesting novel that did have me wanting to know how it all turned out, but for some reason did not capture my attention through its entirety.  With themes of love, revenge, and justice, you may enjoy this book more than I did.  I recommend this book to those of you that enjoy crime thrillers.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|ANOTHER WONDERFUL TEEN 80'S MOVIE ABOUT GROWING UP. SEEMS LIKE THIS WAS THE THEME BACK IN THOSE DAYS. ANOTHER CLASSIC STILL AS FRESH TODAY AS IT WAS 25 PLUS YEARS AGO.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|At this point in its seventy five years of existence, \\"Superman\\" has really become more of a concept than a character. As one of the progenitors of the superhero comic book genre, and a automatic staple for religious allegory and minorities, the character known as Superman is a recipe for success when done right. It's just too bad that most really can't seem to perfect the \\"done right\\" part.<br /><br />I went into \\"Man of Steel\\" with no expectations outside of a good movie. At this point of my life, \\"Superman\\" as licensed product either delivers or he doesn't. The discussions you can have with diehard fans usually ends up being the most interesting part of \\"Superman\\" itself (sometimes). The worst I could say about Bryan Singer's \\"[[ASIN:B000J10ERO Superman Returns]] (2006)\\" is that it was as offensively boring as Tarsem Singh's \\"[[ASIN:B007H7XJD4 Immortals]] (2011)\\". Unlike the latter (which is as shallow as it gets), it was full of good intentions, but nothing remotely decent to support those intentions. (If you were fan of the Super-stalker and scorned women Lois, then \\"Superman Returns\\" was probably the movie for you.) Zack Snyder's biggest challenge was simply making an engaging film. Something he is not incapable of. However, his biggest Achilles heel in this regard was the same weakness that director's Stephen Norrington, Guillermo del Toro and Christopher Nolan had to deal with. David S. Goyer and his own affinity for visual, but not detail.<br /><br />THE SET UP:<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" aims to be what \\"[[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville]]\\" was in the bumpy span of ten years. The story of Clark \\"Kal-El\\" Kent; the son of two worlds, searching for purpose and stability in a world that he actively hides himself from because of his literal status as an [humanoid] alien from another planet. From his birth, through his adolescence to his adulthood, Clark Kent goes through the motions of heartache, wondering if he'll ever be accepted for what he is, should he decide toshow him. If he'll ever know his parentage. That is, until a tip leads him to 20,000 year old ship that connects him to the world he never knew ...And leads a group of exiled Kryptonians to Earth. Their sole purpose is to recreate the planet they lost as a result of their species' hubris, even if that means it's at the expense of the present occupants of Earth.<br /><br />WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT:<br /><br />CONCEPT:<br />Krypton has experienced as much iteration as the character of Superman himself has; but somewhere down the line, the affinity and mythos that Richard Donner injected into the license really brought iteration to a stagnate halt. Here, there was clearly an effort made to inject a different kind of culture and lifestyle into Krypton, even under the stipulation that it still had to be blown to smithereens. And it's not that the previous incarnations of \\"Superman\\" and Krypton never had a culture or a way of life, no. It's that the biggest thing about Krypton was how Superman left the planet to come to ours.<br /><br />Here, the film gives you a proactive glimpse into said culture, either through expository dialog, a billion things racing at the screen, or the implication that Krypton is so sterile and self-controlled that they breed children for a specific duty and that duty alone. Everything on the planet is coded, cataloged and processed, much like every industry that provides its services to the public here on Earth. Their clothing, however \\"World of Warcraft\\" and \\"generic sci-fi concept art\\"-ish much of it comes off, intrigues you at the very least with the idea of how their lives operated on the dying planet. There is a concrete reason for the existence of the \\"S\\" and oddly shaped symbols on the shields on their chests. It's an extension of their language and the clique mentality of the planet itself.<br /><br />The concept of Clark Kent becoming some nomad because he either draws too much attention to himself or is proactively searching for whatever that makes him who he is, outside the influence of humankind, is also an interesting idea. I like the idea of Clark not immediately knowing what the heck to do with himself as an adult; either being too enamored in his quarter-life-crisis waywardness that any job is never too lowly for him take, or he's really scared of interacting with people in general. It also implies that the people he meets, all of them of varying walks of life and personalities, would at the very least inspire him to become a superhero, if that's his intention to begin with.<br /><br />Carrying over \\"Smallville\\" Lois Lane's ability to connect the dots herself between Clark Kent and whatever guise of heroism he happens to take the mantle of was also a great idea. I've heard it argued that Lois deducing his identity ruins the \\"love triangle\\" between herself, Superman and Clark (basically Clark) and diminishes their relationship, but I don't see it that way. I'd argue the mere suggestion of throwing them into a romantic relationship, without pretense of setting up a foundation of friendship it can grow from, is the bigger crime as far as their relationship goes. It like, Superman as a character, is integral to what makes the franchise what it is. To move directly into romance because it's expected of Lois/Clark, is not only insulting, but an affront to both characters and anyone who appreciates their rapport.<br /><br />Villains with marginally sympathetic motives that drive them is another concept I enjoyed. Zod, Jor-El, Faora and the Kryptonians whom survived the destruction of Krypton, all of them are motivated to restore the lives of their lost civilization and that is something anyone can sympathize or relate to --- even if that was never the intention of the writer or director. You connect with Zod's mission: A man who is bred for war decides to do something about the degenerating state of his society because of the complete apathy of his culture. You sympathize with what he wants to do, even if you disagree with his methods. It's just a shame he's made out to be a complete idiot because he's never aware of the planet's destruction. It's all in the name of painting him as the antagonist against Jor-El who's content with dying but wants to save what's caused the problem for his culture altogether.<br /><br />ACTION:<br />Hands down, \\"Man of Steel\\" contains the best Superman fight scenes and choreography in a live action \\"Superman\\" adaptation, period. Outside of the composition for the score, this is where the movie both excels and stumbles. The sense of speed and strength that's translated to the screen through the actions of the Kryptonians speaks in volumes and is delivered to the viewing audience perfectly in the second half of the film (Smallville brawl). The first half's action is almost incomprehensible with how much camera blur is used. Elsewhere, the film at least steady enough to focus on a particular event. Faora's and her giant Non-type friend, Nam-Ek, fight scenes with Superman are arguably the best the film had to offer. Zod and Superman's battle near the end of the while, while great for merely showing off Zod's prowess in battle, really can't be appreciated because of the fatigue from almost endless battle sequences that run on for nearly the length of a \\"Smallville\\" episode.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br />Performances range from great to stilted. In the end, it really depends on the amount of time given to an actor and how they deal with the material in the given time. Laurence Fishburne's performance as Perry White is probably the only performance from the minor human characters I enjoyed outside of Christopher Meloni as Colonel Hardy. He was barely on the screen, but Fishburne never fails to deliver an otherwise great performance. He embodies the hardnosed Perry White without ever breaking a sweat, and Meloni? Dude continued to surprise me with the little things he did as the skeptic Hardy who finds antagonistic kinship with Faora.<br /><br />CHARACTER:<br />Starting off with the best character: Faora is ultimately the brightest and strongest elements of \\"Man of Steel\\" by the virtue of her actress, Antje Traue (\\"[[ASIN:B0038P80CO Pandorum]]\\"). How she handles what little is given to her speaks to her talent. The mere fact that this character is allowed to be as vicious and as powerful as her commander, Zod, without the sexist stigmatization that follows her gender is amazing. Faora is defined by what she does in the name of her planet and the role she was given in that society. She lives for war, she is a warrior and the film never judges her for that. Instead they meet her head on with respect and as a result, you've got a standout character and a standout performance.<br /><br />Similarly, Michael Shannon's Zod is probably my favorite take on the character. For the all the Aryan nation and Eugenic driven ideals that this character is motivated by, for all the crap he ends up handicapped by as a result of shoddy storytelling, Shannon chews the scenery in a way that is both self-aware and dedicated to the essence of the character. Zod is literally driven mad and to the extremes because of what his society programmed him to do and to watch him attempt to justify his genocidal ideas under the helm of Shannon's performance is incredible.<br /><br />Henry Cavil, like Brandon Routh, is severely limited by what he is allowed to do with the character of Superman/Clark Kent. He has charisma, but he's never really allowed to use any of it. This is largely as a result of the screenwriter never having a firm concept of what he wanted Clark Kent or Superman to be. Cavil and Goyer get the little tidbits that make Superman/Clark who he is (the need to save people because he has that power, the need to know where he's from; his determination), but when it comes to a solid characterization, the most that ever merges from both parties is \\"brooding\\" and \\"aimless\\". Also, glasses do not work with his face. At least, not the ones they chose.<br /><br />Russell Crowe as Jor-El is another good performance in the movie, but it isn't until the character's dead that he appears to actually get a feel for Jor-El. This makes his death a pointless endeavor to begin with. This isn't to say he's bad in the first act, but he is by no means as entertaining as he was as a hologram designed solely for expository dialog about things you already know about. He has a particularly great chemistry with Michael Shannon. The two do more to sell that Zod and Jor-El are estranged friends than the dialog really does through their actions and that's pretty amazing, considering what they're given to work with.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />I'll be upfront, I think Zimmer's score is better than \\"Man of Steel\\" itself. It's certainly better than his \\"[[ASIN:B008645YEE Dark Knight Rises]]\\" score (the only good thing about that was Catwoman's theme). Most the things that occurred in the film never felt like they earned the grandiose personality of the score, which felt out of place in a lot of scenes. Other times it didn't and that was usually in the action sequences that hinged on \\"Zod's Theme\\" (\\"Arcade\\", \\"You Die or I do\\", \\"Terraforming\\"). With the exception of \\"What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?\\" and \\"Flight\\" the score itself really doesn't work on its own until you're given some kind of context, which is a weakness for a lot of Zimmer's scores. That said, Zimmer created a solid theme for reboot Superman and its one I hope he's given the chance to expand upon.<br /><br />WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET RIGHT:<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br />Jenny Olsen is a character I would've liked to have seen more of. She's a genderbent Jimmy Olsen and that's fantastic (it certainly upped the number of female characters present onscreen), but Rebecca Buller never gets to do anything to warrant the necessity of her character's existence. She walks about in the background, states the obvious and unfortunately becomes adamsel in distress (obviously because Lois isn't fulfilling that role). The only time she's allowed shine as an actress is that one single scene between herself Fishburne that sells a particular moment of peril, but it never really resonates completely because you know they're not allowed to die in the narrative anyway. It feels unnecessary to cut back to Buller and Fishburne outside of reminding us that they're still in the movie, a movie where they haven't done much of anything. Harry Lennix is particularly underwhelming as a gruff General Swanwick, whose sole purpose in the film appears to merely give reaction shots, state the obvious in tense situations (\\"whatever they want, it's not good\\") and frown at insubordinate soldiers under his command. He is really not given anything to work with, even as a character minimally ingrained in the action of the film.<br /><br />I went into \\"Man of Steel\\" with no expectations for Lois Lane, but Amy Adams was pretty underwhelming to be honest: The most I could say is that she outdid Kate Bosworth, but that's not a difficult task at all. At the very least, the character was honored enough to be allowed to participate in the film's narrative itself (what little there was), but there's so much it does to put her into a position that never feels earned. Other than that, she was just \\"there\\". There were far too many instances in the movie where her presence never felt necessary but she ended up in key moments (via teleportation or some other contrivance) because she was Lois and this is a \\"Superman\\" movie. She didn't have much to contribute to plot beyond a brief exposition that would've had her running from buildings like Perry and Jenny. If they really wanted Lois to be in the middle of the action, Goyer should've fell back on her history as military brat/daughter with connections to the military via her father, General Sam Lane (which means they should've used him). At the very least that would've facilitated a plausible excusefor her being in places where civilians are actively excluded.<br /><br />More to the point, her chemistry with Cavil as Superman never quite took off. As associates or friends, this carnation of Superman and Lois works, because that's all there is between them. Friendship based on gratitude for keeping his secret, saving her life and, well, a shared goal (save Earth). And I was seriously digging this because I thought they were going to handle this like \\"Smallville\\" did. Friendship first, romance way, way later. But the moment they even tried to inject the romantic angle into their dynamic it was like watching Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth all over again. It was just awkward as heck and never earned by the film itself. You could really see it in the actor's faces when they had to execute the kissing scene (they were not into it). Superman and Lois in \\"Man of Steel\\" make great Bros, but love interests? That is a galactic \\"How about No\\".<br /><br />David Goyer --- as per his usual methods --- has no real conceptual or concrete understanding of the characters he's dealing with. Really, I don't think Synder's direction helped all that much either, but he does not have the same impact on the character of Lois like Goyer does. This guy is a poor screenwriter who happens to understand the basic idea of a great concept for a movie, but cannot for the life of him execute it. I mean, he is just mediocre and continues to produce mediocre screenplays. I'm sorry Adams had to work with what was a bland interpretation of an otherwise passionate character. I'd hope she'll end up with better material, but seeing as I doubt they'll be rid of Goyer, I expect nothing more except a blander Goyer Lane.<br /><br />Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are really miscast as Jonathan and Martha Kent. Disregarding the ten years Annette O'Toole and John Schneider had as Clark's adoptive parents in \\"Smallville\\", Lane and Costner were not only limited in what they could do with the characters, theynever truly felt as though they embodied them either despite their efforts. Lane as Martha is pedestrian. There's nothing remarkable about her performance, the film treats her like Rosemary Harris in \\"Spider-Man 3\\". It ignores her contributions to the film outside of a few moments and continues to hold the father figure up as the crux of importance despite her survival over the latter. She's not horrible (heck she's got a nice chemistry with Cavil), but I don't think she was great either. Costner phones in a performance that is perhaps crippled by more \\"trailer quotes\\" than even Russell Crowe was as Jor-El. I understand the intention was to merely depict Jonathan as concerned for his son's safety in the face of mankind's xenophobia, but the manner in which this concern is delivered is awful. His dialog is full of mixed signals. He insulates that he wants Clark to wait until the right time to reveal himself (meaning waiting until CLARK feels the time is right), but is actively against any decisions Clark makes for himself in regards to his own fate and that is by no means an intentional result of the narrative. It comes off both confusing and overly paranoid as opposed to a protective father who wants the best for his son. And worse, in a desperate need to differentiate itself from other Supermen origin tales, Jonathan is killed off in a manner that harkens back to Snyder's directorial debut, \\"[[ASIN:B002NWOI0G Dawn of the Dead]] (2004)\\".<br /><br />It's literally a \\"Went to save my dog. If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, everyone drop everything and come save me*\\" moment. Except no one goes save him because it's supposed to be a heartbreaking and dramatic moment. The entire scenario is a plot contrivance that you could literally counter with a thousand different scenarios and come out with a better result. The moment comes off like a scene from a parody and I had to stop myself from laughing at the scene in the theater because it was so earnest in its intentions. The setup and execution was atrocious. To say the least, nothing was lost when Costner was removed from the film and I'm beginning to think it would've been less flawed if he wasn't in it to begin with.<br /><br />EXECUTION: NARRATIVE and PACING:<br />The pacing and editing in \\"Man of Steel\\" is truly awful. For all the ideas that \\"Man of Steel\\" has, where it fails is the execution of these ideas. \\"Man of Steel\\" wants to be a film about moral quandaries, xenophobia, and acceptance of the different alongside a coming of age story. Instead what we get is a near-three hour film that feels more like a coming attractions reel for a movie that never came to fruition. Most of the important things, like how mankind reacts to Clark during his outing and afterward (like when half the city is nuked on \\"Dragon Ball Z\\" and \\"Gundam\\" proportions that makes both look tame), are glossed over in a painful show of a lack of attention to the world around the characters.<br /><br />Despite strengths lie within the visual and not so much the technical, Zack Snyder has proven he can and is able to focus on the finer details of characters in a film, particularly when the film has not been written by him. \\"Man of Steel\\", however, is just another instance when his collaboration with weaker elements and too many hands in the pot. This has him falling back on his visual eye. The film focuses more on the visual instead of the technical (what is happening instead of how it its happening) and as a result none of the characters really feel all that important verses the environment that surrounds them.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Man of Steel\\" is that it's a three part story squashed into a two hour and a half film. And this is where I think, as a franchise, \\"Superman\\" has always fared better as a written and televised format. Bruce Timm, progenitor of the DC Animated Universe, proved that a \\"Superman\\" origin story can be told and be told well with \\"[[ASIN:B0002ZMHX6 Superman: The Animated Series]]\\". The problem is that it has to be treated as separate from Clark Kent's life, because the biggest part of Superman's origin has little to do with him. It's about his parents and what they do that allows him to become the protagonist of what is essentially his story. \\"Smallville\\" sacrificed showing Krypton altogether and instead peppered its series with bits of Krypton the older Clark got and it was usually how it related to Clark and not the other way around.<br /><br />\\"Superman: The Movie\\" managed to allow its audience to get a feel for Krypton and how it related to Clark's story in probably less time than \\"Man of Steel\\". All three previous \\"Superman\\"-related media got across the necessity of Krypton in a manner that worked for its format and Clark Kent. The problem with the opening for \\"Man of Steel\\" is that it's wants to be more than about getting Superman to earth and while that is not bad it muddles the point of the film. The difference in Jor-El and Zod is appreciated, but the film strays from its objective: Superman's origin story, which is less about Krypton and more about getting him off Krypton.<br /><br />Here, it's more about Krypton, and Jor-El's relationship with Zod, their differing opinions on the same thing (Krypton is doomed; Krypton needs better leadership and less of what they've built their society as). It's twenty minutes of far too many things going on at too quick a pace. You're introduced to several characters at once, a conflict that you really don't have a great grip on or allowed to understand and the end of the world all at once. Why are these people at war? What led Zod to think his leadership would be better than the present leadership (besides hubris)? Goyer and co. really wanted to make an epic film about Krypton and for all intents and purposes, maybe that's what they should've done.<br /><br />But if they were really adamant about getting this into a film about Clark Kent and not Jor-El and Zod, then the entire Krypton sequence should have been moved to the second act of the film where Clark discovers the ship. Start the movie either with Young Clark Kent or Clark Kent on the fisherman's boat for \\"The Deadliest Catch\\". Get into his turmoil first. That way, the holographic version of his father isn't telling US, the AUDIENCE, everything we already know about in a show of really poor screenplay structure through expository dialog. As interesting as the CONCEPTS of Krypton was, the entirety of the events themselves don't resonate with me, no matter how much is TOLD to me as opposed to SHOWN through the actions of the characters about to bite it. And this continues to happen over and over in the movie. We and the characters are told a lot of things, but we're never shown them. Clark even tells how Zod to use his powers on Earth (\\"Focus on one thing\\") just to justify the ending.<br /><br />Clark's childhood and young adulthood is sacrificed in the name of choppy \\"in medias res\\" editing. I'm not against non-linear storytelling, but they don't do it well at all here. The editing is just really, really sloppy. Christopher Nolan managed to make it work in a film like \\"Batman Begins\\". He knows how to pace a film and show us what was necessary to Bruce Wayne's character arc after his parent's death. Snyder and Goyer? Everything that happens to Clark in his youth feels like \\"A series of unfortunate events\\" that are meant to tease something greater but never come to full fruition. These are the moments where we're supposed to be getting to know Clark Kent as a character, why he is the way he is. But on top of some poorly set up plot points that are meant to be stirring and dramatic (Jonathan's death and the Oil Rig sequence), everything that occurs before the third act has nothing to predicate them.<br /><br />The pilot for \\"Smallville\\" shows us why Lex Luthor crashed his car and ran Clark over (it even sets up a great relationship). \\"Man of Steel\\" is perfectly content with the bus' wheel exploding for no reason and the bus going over the edge with nothing to show us why. \\"Smallville\\" shows us why Clark's powers are manifesting and how he learns to control them. \\"Man of Steel\\" is content to show us one really great instance of the how, but never the why and never how he learns to adjust after the first try. And this really makes the flying sequence come off as incredibly flat and without the sense of awe it should've had. If he isn't used to flying, how does he even know he can do it well? I'm not asking for three hours of a young Clark Kent story, but I am asking for some kind of attention to detail, some sign they cared about young Clark Kent as something other than a plot device to get them to adult Clark Kent.<br /><br />There is very little care taken into Clark Kent as a character, almost none, because they're more interested in getting him into the suit than they are developing him as a character. Show us how he interacts with the people before he ends up saving them. Show us why'd he chose the jobs he did. Does he even want to become a \\"superhero\\", is that even his reasons for searching for his origins? Why he is totally okay with revealing his identity to almost everyone he meets (defeating the purpose of \\"Glasses\\") and why is Lois calling him \\"Clark\\" in front of everyone instead of \\"Superman\\"? Basically, it's another case of the writer dismissing Clark Kent as a valid character in his own right over his \\"alter ego\\" Superman, instead of treating them like one and the same.<br /><br />The antagonism between Clark and Zod's men is poorly set up. The crux of the story lives and dies on Zod's need to recreate Krypton on Earth and the Codex thingy and without compromise. There's an opportunity wherein Clark and Zod could've had a dialog with each other, maybe not have Zod come off as completely hostile from the word go. Plant some doubt in Clark who has nothing but the word of a hologram to go off of. It's basically one of the most avoidable conflictsin the world, either by Jor-El never telling Zod where he sent his son or sending the Codex in something else besides his son's blood (which literally made me laugh when that was revealed). But because it's \\"Earth\\" and this is \\"Superman\\", the narrative has Zod attack the planet without thought or consideration of other or adjacent planets.<br /><br />There's not even a moment where Superman attempts to dissuade Zod from Earth to someplace else (like Mars), no real argument whatsoever. The moment he finds out this is what Zod wants to do (in a dream interrogation because reasons and skulls), he's full on antagonistic. I also don't know why a general, a guy who looks for the best possible solutions through tactics and or strength alone, is against the idea of taking over a planet where he is literally stronger than his worst enemies. The reasoning provided is flimsy and at best something a petty child could come up with and Zod is anything but. Worst of all, excluding Nam-Ek, Jax-Ur and Faora, most of Zod's men aren't even used. Here we have a literal army of Supermen and none of them are used to their fullest abilities in a manner that would've benefited the film. Instead they all hang out in their ship and don't do anything. Superman's basic compassion for mankind is rather null and void. For all \\"Red Rookie\\"-isms in this film, the basic concept of leading your enemy away from populated areas is a given for anyone who's even privy to the definition of collateral damage or risk management.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" instead leads the combat straight into the heart of Smallville and Metropolis without ever showing Clark considering that maybe he should move his rear end elsewhere, instead of telling the populace to run into buildings that are about to be demolished by his very being. The massive levels of destruction really fly into the face what Superman is actually fighting to accomplish (as little death as possible) and is, in the end, all for a large special effects extravaganza that will either excite or bore you to death. There are more dead people from the combined efforts of Zod and Superman than there are people saved. It's probably one of the things that make the ending so horrendously awkward because there should be attention to detail. Superman should be held accountable for everything that happened and there should've been some sign that the destruction would hold repercussions. Instead we get an ending like Superman ended a hostage situation, the city presumably back to normal again.<br /><br />The religious parallels that extend beyond positioning Henry Cavil before a painted glass window of Jesus praying to his father or flying backward out of a ship like he's been crucified for our sins, bother me more than anything. For all the \\"goodness\\" that supposedly exudes from Jor-El, he really comes off like a man with a bigger superiority complex than Zod. He assumes that mankind needs an Uberman like Clark Kent without ever assessing that the planet was probably better off without him (because, for all intents and purposes, he's reason they end up needing him anyway. Clark's a self-fulfilling prophecy).<br /><br />He assumes Earth needs a guardian and continues to boost his son up as one, even in death. There's never an instance where Clark rejects the idea of the \\"Godhood\\" Jor-El preaches about, he just accepts it. That's troubling because it suggests that Clark believes, on some level, he is God-like and not someone who just wants to help. Whether or not that was Goyer's intent becomes irrelevant as I doubt he could properly address the issue anyway.<br /><br />TO SUM IT ALL UP:<br />The problem with \\"Man of Steel\\" is that, despite all its good intentions, its acute lack of attention to detail and poor execution cuts its legs out from under it. If could I say anything about the movie it's that everyone who wasn't Clark Kent/Superman, Martha, Jonathan and Lois Lane made this movie half as enjoyable as it was when things weren't exploding and fists weren't being exchanged. Michael Shannon and Antje Traue really made the villains of this film. Superman, when it comes down to it, feels like a character that reacted to a series of events but was never truly affected by them. And that's not to say Cavil was bad --- he, like every other Superman so far, works what he's given and makes the best of a limited situation. That's about it.<br /><br />Or maybe I just can't get over, how, for a movie that's almost three hours, they were in such a hurry to get Krypton, Clark's past and the reintroduction of his heritage out of the way so they could blow stuff up. And if I didn't know any better, they worked on the latter part of the film far more than they did the earliest parts of it. There were some great ideas in the movie and for what its worth, I really enjoyed it. But, its problems are just glaringly obvious and the ideas weren't executed well at all.

B004EPZ06G|1.0|I thought the first movie was passable, but Hangover Part II is simply awful, awful awful !!! The plot has the same structure of these grown men who act like teenagers and can't seem to remember what happened last night at the bachelor party. Of course, when they wake up one of the four is missing (again !!!), so they set out to find him, this time in Thailand. Just to add a little much needed support to the now-thin concept the director throws in a monkey who goes everywhere with these immature duds. This might work in a circus or with an organ grinder, but in a movie we get tired of the monkey after two minutes. As in the first movie, these guys get into all sorts of mindless, stupid, moronic, and unimaginative situations that are supposed to have us laughing out of our seats, but instead make us wonder if the movie can just get any worse. And it does. If you are a ten-year-old you might find this screen disaster slightly funny. But if you are older, avoid this bomb at all costs. Not even the monkey could save this idiotic film. You might just get a few more laughs by watching a vintage Three Stooges short film---and no monkey needed.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|Owned for only a few month now and it has done its job well. I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my I-touch (4th Gen.) 3 times before having to recharge the unit itself. I use the 1A port for my charges. Rarely charge two devices at the same time but it does come in handy when I do need. Worth the buy if you are on the go a lot and need some juice.

B00A0R0CG0|5.0|The movie is entertaining and the kids love it.  We use it on their tablet while in restaurants, etc. and their mobile DVD player in the car.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|The best parts were all in the highlights...<br />Not a waste of time, but really slow-moving. I suspect a lot of kids would get too bored with it to watch the whole thing.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|The show looks a little dated, but you get past that really quickly. It's easy to see the influence of The Shield had on shows like Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy (particularly SoA, as there are some of the same people involved).<br /><br />I burned through season one in two days, and I'm about to start season 3 tomorrow.

B006ZN7KMM|5.0|Primero toca hechos que he conocido (no soy un jovencito) y la forma de escritura es refinada y te vuelve al pasado.  Está sobre todo, eso, bien escrito; sin la pedantería que a veces usan los periodistas para escribir, cuando procuran destacarse ellos como escritores por sobre los hechos que narran. Recomendado.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Nothing beats a classic. Little Women is always a good read even if you've read it before. If you have only seen the movie then this is a must read.
B008ASGP3U|3.0|The story is written well and has a good plot; just not my cup of tea.  It's a bit on the dark side and that's not usually my choice of reading material.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I won't pretend that I have been listening to Soilwork since &#34;Chainheart Machine.&#34;  I have all of their albums now...but I started with &#34;Stabbing the Drama&#34; which is still my favorite album.  &#34;The Living Infinite&#34; is my second favorite.  The fact that there are 2 CD's is a huge bonus.  Both disks are very much unique in their own way...but they are also a perfect segue when listened to back to back.  I'm not sure how Strid still does it; but his range is still amazing and impressive as always.  I like the fact that they have aged their music with their life experience; and don't try to pretend that they are a bunch of angry teenagers.  &#34;The Living Infinite&#34; has it all.  They incorporate all of their styles in a way that just plain fits.  The album has songs that make you want to see how much you can bench-press, to songs that make you reflect on your life in the present moment.  This is truly a great album, and any fan (even a partial fan) of Soilwork will be very impressed with this album.  Buy it; it will not disappoint.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book makes you think about, cry for and feel the emotions of the family it portrays.  It makes you realize that life can turn on a dime.  Very good read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the twists didn't see them coming. Haven't read a bad Grisham book yet. Can't wait till the next one
B0098460O4|5.0|I stumbled across a YouTube clip of Johnathan & Charlotte's audition for Britain's got talent.  I love the blend of Jonathan's spot on opera voice and Charlotte's clear not so operatic voice.  Since they sing all but one song in Italian, I did some research on-line.  I was blown away with the transformation of several pop tunes I had never heard before.  Kudos to the producer, arranger, and others involved in the selection of songs on the album.  The only technical downside was that when the orchestra swelled, it dominated, and sometimes obliterated the duo - especially Charlotte.  They are, after all, who we want to hear.  Can hardly wait for the advance orders for \\"The 2nd Album\\" to be posted on US Amazon. (Currently available only on Amazon UK.)
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have purchased many things on Amazon, but this is the first one I came back to review. I felt the need to share how great this product is.  These headphones are great for general use: gaming, office/work, calls, music, voice. This is why this product really shines, it's well suited for anything.   The one thing that is not perfect is the sound quality. I want to clarify on what I mean by 'not perfect'. Relative to in-ear headphones of similar cost, or expensive high-end headphones, the sound is not great. The main reason for this is the headphones lay loosely over your entire ears,  which allows for less sound isolation. However, this is also a reason they are so great for certain things. They block out enough sound that when I am working, so that I cannot be distracted unless someone is right next to me asking a question.  Other than that, what has amazed me is the durability. I am a student, and a programmer. I am basically either studying with these, or programming with these. I wear them on average of 8 hours a day, listening to music and making calls with them. I constantly am taking them on and off (although they conveniently adjust to fit around your neck) - and I have had no problems with them. They have been dropped often, but always hold strong.  The comfort of these is great. Since these don't completely block out sound and sit a little bit loose, I am able to wear them for long hours. The padding is great. Finally, the voice quality is phenomenal. Using them with voice/video chat is great. While working, I have my cell phone forwarded through GVoice so I can talk through these. The sound quality on calls on both ends is just amazing. Overall, a great purchase.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This story is a reminder of how precious time is. Spend your time wisely and as meaningful to others as you can....it's how you'll be remembered.

044042335X|5.0|Bad Luck and Trouble by Lee Child<br /><br />\\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"  Reacher reunites with his old unit in this terrorism focused thriller.<br /><br />Reacher's unit reflected his own dynamic ethics.  \\"You do not mess with the special investigators\\", was followed up by dramatic action.  Then they all left the service.  Years later Reacher is contacted because one of his special investigators is in trouble.  Predictably Reacher and the others come together to help their friend.<br /><br />Regardless of how you feel about vigilante justice you have to love the camaraderie and loyalty that Jack Reacher incorporated in his unit.  Their stalwart defense of their own is admirable.<br /><br />Once again there is a great deal of violence and if you are Old Testament oriented much of it is explainable.  Good character studies and a solid plot are once again very much a part of this page turner.<br /><br />Repeating myself, Child has a very vivid imagination.  He comes up with some amazingly despicable people.  Some of this book was hard to read but fits perfectly with Reacher's style of justice.<br /><br />You can't really describe Jack Reacher as a hard man with a soft heart because the soft spots on his heart are not readily accessible.  He is a hard man with an overdeveloped sense of justice, perhaps not legally acceptable justice but justice never the less.<br /><br />As in all the Jack Reacher books I have read so far, there is non-stop action and lots of violence.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a good time playing this game!!! Me and my son had a fun time playing this game together! Make a second!

B00CQGU9GG|5.0|So now we have a choice in our ZZ Top music.  This set, which returns the original mixes to us, or Six Pack, with its remixes.<br /><br />I bought \\"Six Pack\\" a few months back in a used record store for $10.00, and I wasn't mortified by the remixes of the songs.  My thought was \\"Hey if ZZ Top wants to spice up their back catalogue, It's their music and their prerogative\\".  But I don't want to do a side by side comparison of the two sets.<br /><br />I like this 10 disc offering.  Playing the first 4 CDs from start to stop and enjoying the bluesy/rootsy sound of them,  ZZ Top are bluesmen at heart and their deep love of the style shows.  With Eliminator they started a blues rock sound that continued pretty much to the present day.  Blues has depth and feeling to it, ZZ Top expresses both no matter what instruments they use.  In all truth they weren't the first to a synthesizer to fill out the rhythm of a blues song.  If it complements their song and expands their creativity, why not.<br /><br />I also like the way the emphasis is on the music.  Do we always need a booklet with essays and photos?  Do you always look at it each time you play the album?  Why bloat the packaging, when the music presented here starts out with basic and pure blues and develops in style and instrumentation as we move deeper in to it.  So keeping to the front and back album covers with a few fold outs is not a bad idea.  It keeps you focused on what you are hearing and not on what you are seeing.<br /><br />And what you will hear on these 10 CDs is good music, well presented and well mastered.  Warners is not adding to the loudness wars CDs here.  The sound on all of these albums is very acceptable.  The sound is well equalized and very clear through the set.  Again, Warners did not over do it.  I hope what we have here is a signal that the loudness war is over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best for car time. It's like temple run but you don't have to tilt the screen and you could just swipe.<br />There is an inspector who is chasing you through the subway and you have to dodge trains while getting power ups<br />Highly recommend it.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|It's a very good film but it has two glaring weaknesses in my opinion.<br /><br />First, the focus seems to be on the aesthetic over the story.  It's beautifully shot and produced but one feels the visual has to make up for a good, though underdeveloped plot.<br /><br />Second, I admit to not being a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf in the first place and asking him to carry a film where the \\"supporting\\" cast includes Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, Gary Oldman and Jessica Chastain is just silly.  The \\"wimpy\\" brother also runs the risk of being the most unlikeable of the three, which is not all his fault.  Poor Jason Clarke is given nothing else to do but drink and beat people up!<br /><br />It's a shame that Chastain and Oldman, arguably the finest actors of the bunch, are saddled with the thinnest characters but they light up every scene!
1600595871|5.0|This is a great book with a huge number of creative options. The explanations and diagrams are clear and easy to follow.
B004EQAVFU|4.0|A delicately haunting and beautifully made film version of a brilliant, unique, and profoundly unsettling book by Kazuo Ishiguro.  Perfectly cast and directed, with a look and feel that's memorably evocative of the original novel.  Blu-ray transfer quality is stunning.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed difficult but not too hard. Can't wait for new levels.<br />This only has 10 levels which are fun and compelling.
B008220C56|5.0|This is stunningly inventive and incomparably gorgeous from start to finish; every element is perfectly realised to the smallest detail.  The classic story is very cleverly and beautifully condensed, with much visual and emotional impact.  The intricate orchestration of the camerawork with the settings alone is breathtaking; ditto the use of colour, costumes, score, and brilliantly audacious direction, and the constantly unfolding array of haunting,magically memorable moments.  The Blu-ray transfer quality is spectacular.  A very special film, truly a work of art.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book 2 will keep you on the edge of your seat from cover to cover. If you enjoyed the first, you' love the second!

I love this app ive only had it for one day and I already am feeling sore...that means its working!! woo hop I'm so keeping this app I love the fact that you can choose how to long you want your workout to be and which areas you want to work on. And its wonderful on my kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for people of all ages! The graphics are great. Plus its a great game for free! I recommend for horse lovers :)
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album exceeds all my high expectations. Ozzy sounds as good as ever and Iommni is just amazing with those heavy,thudding,and dark riffs. We hear some hints of old,like laguna sunrise and planet caravan. Still '13' sounds new and stands on its own. My favorite tracks are damaged soul and age of reason. Curiously the first song,end of the beginning ,started weak and then picked up speed as it progresses. My favorite Ozzy line is,\\"I don't mind dying because,i'm already dead\\". Even the hologram art cover was a nice touch. Did anybody notice bill wards absence ? These guys are the pinnacle of doom and speed metal !
B005K01VZS|4.0|It was an interesting story of love and faith and a look into a Jewish perspective for a gentile.  Inspirational.

B00DGMVJAO|1.0|sound kept increasing and decreasing. also kept cutting in and out. had to keep adjusting the sound. was unable to enjoy this movie
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|It's an okay game. The nursery pauses itself so animals aren't born within the right time. It freezes on my Kindle. Wish there was more you could do and that you could earn money by charging admissions. Like that peanuts can be earned. ITS fun but has quarks.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love it. It has good puzzles. Nice game options. Just wish it was a little harder. But still keeps me entertained.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app is so addicting, I love it. I almost didn't download this game. I am so glad I did.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought the story kept me envolved the whole time.  She placed just enough twists in to keep me guessing.  Though I would not rate the book as a literar master piece, it remained interesting the entire time.  It is a good read.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Protects headset while charging. Also comes with a longer USB cable. Would recommend if you have this particular headset. Had it in my wish list and purchased it when it went on sale with free shipping direct from Amazon.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|It's got in-app purchasing but all the required parts to play the game successfully are available if you go there for the daily rewards.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was just as good as the other two what a great ending I had trouble putting it down wonderful
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book, was hooked from the beginning to the end.  Great read for anyone who loves a space adventure or for anyone who just loves an adventure especially through the eyes of someone else.
B003G4W49C|4.0|So far, I've only read Ender's Game, but I loved it. It was a very quick read and was very entertaining.

0132350882|5.0|This book is 'the' book for serious software writers. Do you think that you understand object oriented programming? Read this and tell me again. Do you think starting TDD is difficult? Read this book and you have done half of the basic work required for TDD. Do you think that you write beautiful/elegant code? Read this book and tell me how you define elegance now.<br /><br />This book is not for the 'just want to get over it' type of software developers. If you are serious about your work and you want to keep your colleagues, your business (eventually) and your product in good shape, this book is for you. I am glad that i read this book and even more glad that i convinced a lot of other people to read it. It is worth every penny and every minute spent.
B00021HBGS|5.0|I had these for my kids and now I buy them for gifts for other people's kids. They are fun to play with and very durable.

0316113514|5.0|Excellently written, and included many motivating patient accounts that would spark anyone's interest and motivation to engage in sporting activities.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sylvia Day is a skilled storyteller who knows how to capture the readers attention and keep them intrigued and captivated. The mediocre rating comes from the unnecessary use of the c* word when so many other descriptions are possible. Every emotion felt by the characters was punctuated by sex. When they're angry, they have sex. When they're happy, sex. Frustrated?  Sex.  I feel she could have done more to drive the plot and the romance other than constant dirty sex. Not that there's anything wrong with that!
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa are great on their own but make magic together!  This is their second collaboration and the chemistry between them is the stuff of legend.  Don't walk, run and buy this album!!!
B006HGXGWU|5.0|There's only one reason why this movie is amazing......Michael Shannon.  His acting is some of the best you'll ever see in film in this movie.  As a movie itself, there's really not much too it.  He's just the best at being crazy.  I highly recommend buying this film even if you have never heard of it or seen it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy but hard enough to make your mind work.  Love that there are several of these and ecstatic that there will be more to come!!!  Yea!!!
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|If you have never seen this DVD it's definitely worth buying.  I found this movie to be hilarious even though it wasn't a comedy.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this game is suspenceful as well as a heap of good fun the kid like it as well as us older folk's.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|This movie is banned in many countries so if you want to see it, you have to buy it.  I warn you it's a disgusting movie and most people will hate it with a passion.  I found it amazing.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This is a great eye candy movie. The now hollywood actors, with the best bodies, dancing. It's awesome. Channing Tatum is my favorite.
B00846REIS|2.0|I was disappointed everyone said it was a good book to read if you liked fifty shades of grey so I thought ok I will give it a try. There wasn't any story line the main characters meet and then immediately start have sex and that's all it was about.
1481130331|4.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners by Christoph Fischer is an historic fiction novel set in the period preceding and including World War II.<br /><br />The period after World War one to the second war of its kind is pivotal in human history and not easily captured into a single context. Christoph Fischer manages to pull this off in his debut novel, The Luck of the Weissensteiners. The work is heavy on history and light on fiction, but it needs to be to understand why the action is important--on multiple levels. Its impact on characters is another layer entirely.<br /><br />The biggest thing The Luck of the Weissensteiners has going for it is the history its author brilliantly preserved in this work of literature. Most educated people know roughly what happened during this time. And that knowledge infects such a reader with a fever that can only be cured by turning another page. What happens eventually is prejudiced with history and a  foregone conclusion. How it will affect Fischer's cast of characters is what we find we simply must know.<br /><br />One last aspect of the book I enjoyed. . . I risk spoiling a little right here, but it is an amazing thing that grabbed my attention about the novel's overall affect. Anti-semitism is an ugly, hateful and ignorant mentality. Few enlightened minds today would disagree. The period in history given treatment in The Luck of the Weissensteiners begins on a slow boil toward anti-semitism becoming the predominant political attitude throughout Europe. The astounding capture is the rationalization used to justify it both in perpetrators and victims. The real horror is not in the atrocities resulting, but in the descent of the mind into unmitigated evil. Even now, I struggle for words, but this rationalization is a nameless theme that plays again and again throughout this work, hammering the point home: it is easier to ignore evil than it is to face it. The process of the world confronting an unthinkable evil that evolved into an atrocity modern civilization had never known is brilliantly played in miniature through Mr. Fischer's characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Addictive! It's like having a horse. You get to clean feed and pet the horses. The game also gives more gems than pet shop.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|Mike (Billy Crystal) has always dreamed of being a scary monster who's part of the scare team at Monster Inc. Being a student at Monsters University gives him that chance, except no one there thinks he's scary enough. The over-confident Sullivan (John Goodman) is the monster everyone sees potential in but he thinks he doesn't even have to try because his family name is already legendary.<br />  The two compete over who's scarier and can't stand each other. However, when they both get kicked out of scare class, they have no choice but to team up with an oddball fraternity in a scare games competition. If they win, they are back in scare class, if they lose, they are out of Monsters University.<br />  Kids who aren't familiar with underdog movies or an adult fraternity movie might enjoy it more than grown-ups. While in Monster's Inc, Mike said he knew Sullivan since the 4th grade, not college which is another flaw. Despite flaws and the plot not being extremely fresh, the film does have plenty of charm though and preaches a good lesson about being yourself. But it's predictable, while Pixar still hasn't done anything too special since Toy Story 3. I was entertained, but just like Cars 2, the movie was unnecessary and really shouldn't win any Oscars.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I love the way the author revamped a classic fairy tale into a futuristic story that keeps the reader completely intrigued and entertained. I can't wait to read the next book.

I recommend this book to everyone to read it's one of those books you just pick & read again & again hoping you will be able to help change the ending lol & the ending it another whole thing read & you will find out you will not be disappointed & good for all ages young & older lol  !!!!! Please read !!!!
B003UPPO2G|4.0|Great video of the greatest musicians of our time.<br />The DVD is simply the recording of a concert at MGM.  All of their classic songs as well as new ones are performed.  A beautiful tribute to brother Andy.  A great performance with Celine Dion and shots of Olivia Newton-John in the audience.<br />Their voices are sheer magic and just the nostalgia of listening to all those wonderful songs could make you long for those days with a tear in your eye.<br />Sad to watch knowing now that only Barry is left to uphold their remarkable legacy.<br />The only negative comment I have is that the sound quality is not good at all, otherwise an entertaining show!  So happy to have purchased it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book. In its surface a great page turning story. A boy adrift at sea with a Bengal Tiger. Beneath it one of the greatest pieces of metaphorical literature I have ever read. Who is Richard Parker? A tiger or the predatory killer that lives within each if us that we only see when presented with an extreme need for survival? A fantastic look in the mirror at humanity, religion, society and how we justify ourselves to our own conscience. Wether it be addiction, violence, incarceration, war, or any other life experience that causes us to examine the survive at all costs animal within us you can decide. Surviving a war, a hurricane, a terrorist act in that time aren't we all just alone & adrift in a lifeboat with the tiger within us? This book joins the greats such as The Alchemist, Moby Dick, The Crucible, and other incredible pieces of metaphor. A must must read!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Great processor. Working overclocked @4.0 GHz on air for months now and running all the latest games (coupled with a Radeon 7850) with no complaints at all. 100% recommended.

0141345659|5.0|This book had been recomended to me by multiple people, so I eventually broke down and got it from the library. Let me just say, this book is amazing. There is a perfectly crafted plot line paired with lovable characters. With that said, I feel that the character development was a bit rushed. I highly recommend reading (and buying) this book.

B00CX1TSSO|4.0|You knew what was going to happen but loved the new presentation...the characters were well played and the action was really great...I loved it for its totally entertaining fantasy and will watch it again!!!
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|Great movie. 4th best star wars movie behind the original saga. Was pleasantly surprised to find this movie so entertaining.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I had some difficulty with Mr Cruise as as Reacher..I wish they would have at least greyed up his hair..but that said the movie was definitely entertaining from start to finish.  It seemed a bit disconnected to its backstory...and I didn't care for the reciteful way it was delivered....not sure I'd want Tom as Reacher in another film....just doesn't work for me too pretty
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I was bored reading this book but do know of many that LOVED it! Sorry but I wasn't a fan. I had no problem with the order or with shipping.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|What can I say..I laughed I cried I wanted more and it delivered..I think about this fantasy world even when gardening..an exciting addition to timeless classics...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I must say, all the way thru the book had me guessing on how it was going to end-- needless to say I was not disappointed. It definitely gives the reader something to think about. Nicely done! Looking forward to Landay's other books.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I can only rate the movie 3 stars because I got interrupter and haven't finished watching it.  I've enjoyed what I have watched so far.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's an easy game to grasp, fun to play, and enjoyable for kids. I recommend it for anybody looking for a goofy car game.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This was probably the worst, most advertised, useless app I have ever purchased. I thought at first I didn't complete the entire download. Come to find out, no one did. There were no fonts in the package that claimed to make your documents &ldquo; look better than ever&quot;. Very very disappointing.
B0095P31L6|5.0|We will watch anything that J Depp in in. .  he is such a versatile actor. This had a very good story line and kept us drawn in to the characters even though it was animation. We would watch it again any day.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|My family and I attended the Atlanta show. Brian and the boys were all there! This DVD provides a good memory for what it was like to be there.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I love this movie!  Vin Diesel has done a great job building the Fast and Furious franchise.  I was disappointed with movies 2 and 3, but he turned it around with 4- and 5 is even better!  Action packed with a great plot, great cast, and of course great driving.  I'll be purchasing 6 when it comes out, and can't wait to watch 7 and any other sequels of the same caliber.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|It was okay but did not compare to the original movie. Acting was good! It should have been named something else - for me, I know the original one too well and it really wasn't at all like it .
B00006J3WH|5.0|I love this cd!  I carry it in my car at all times and play it often.  I am an avid Buffy fan, and listening (or singing along in my case) to this soundtrack flashes my mind back to one of my favorites episodes every time.  Two thumbs up!  A definite to add to the collection of any Buffyverse fan.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Sometimes the levels are hard to figure out. I do really enjoy playing the game and trying to figure out the levels.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good entertainment for when you are stuck inside. Better than most puzzle games. Takes a good bit of detective work.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|What more could you ask for? Liked this book a lot and am happy its a trilogy.Characters are extremely interesting, the historical aspects are great and the interactions among the characters is always interesting. I thought the author had a way of taking the reader right into the story ...... would certainly recommend this book
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well done.  The acting is superb and all the costumes and props are magnificent.  Can't wait for season 4!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Liked this book, the author was imaginative and entertaining. I suppose one might say this was a young adult novel as the adult characters are not the main focus here. Did not realize this was going to be a &#34;Part 1&#34;. Am glad there is a Part 2&#34; coming as I am very interested in the further adventures of the &#34;Peculiar's&#34; .
B008OOYALE|5.0|Good game to play with friends, petty dragons, and a good context.. The only bad thing that this game has is that is to expensive( habits etc..) But anyway this is the best and my prefer game....!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was the third book in the Crossfire series and I loved every page. Sylvia Day sure knows how to steam up a page - or two - or three - or several. How she continues to surprise me with each love making is astounding. I can¡¦t get enough!<br /><br />After reading the third book some people were upset to find out Gideon and Eva¡¦s story didn¡¦t end here, but honestly I didn¡¦t mind. I enjoyed this book as much as the others. This one focused on their relationship and them learning the true value of trust. Their love for each other is undeniably strong.<br /><br />More questions requiring answers emerge in this story. I guess we¡¦ll be finding out the answers in the next two.  Even though I loved every word written in Entwined with You, I do wonder how the next two books will go. But I believe in Sylvia Day¡¦s writing and trust she will continue turning us on and have us eagerly turning each page. Not just for the love scenes but also for the answers which will help give Gideon and Eva the beginning of their much deserved happily ever after.<br /><br />Sylvia Day could have ended this book at a couple of different points to make it a bit of a cliffhanger but she was kind enough to spare her fans that kind of angst. I find that when you get involved in a series which you really enjoy, you become attached to the characters, they almost seem like close family or friends. You sometimes don¡¦t want it to end. I¡¦ll gladly accept more books in the Crossfire series, how could I say no to more Gideon? The answer is I couldn¡¦t. When a series is over it¡¦s hard to say good-bye and I¡¦m not quite ready to bid a farewell to Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell. Mostly Gideon º
B0055QYKQO|5.0|has really nice guidelines on the board itself. it was my first time installing a motherboard and i did everything right. Recommended for people who want to learn how to install a motherboard. this board is also great for the price.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Great to see a new album from Daft Punk!  It definitely has a different style than their previous albums, but nearly all the songs are solid.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun and I love horses. If u like then too then I think u should get this game
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Why do I pay $179 for a Kindle Fire and then Amazon decides they can make a free version of this game, but it's not compatible with my Amazon product?<br />I think after paying this much for my Kindle Fire, I shouldn't have to pay $3 to get the game.<br />Using the Kindle Fire for Android Apps is like tying your feet together before going driving. Essentially useless.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Michael Giacchino thank you for this wonderful film score. I had the pleasure of seeing Michael in San Pedro Calif on May 11th at the Varese Sarabande: 35th Anniversary Celebration. We heard a breath-taking performance by the Golden State Pops Orchestra of parts of this film score live, and conducted my Michael himself. It was truly worth the long standing ovation it received from the audience.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|This album was a pleasant surprise!! I became interested in the album coming forth, when I first heard \\"Power Trip.\\" I couldn't wait to check out both this album and Kanye's as well, since both were released on the same day, and I must say, unlike Kanye's failure, this album does not disappoint!!! Fresh beats, clever lyrics, good flow, and J. Cole isn't afraid to touch on subjects that most rappers will not cover in today's hip-hop culture. The extra tracks on the deluxe version do not disapoint as well.... I'm glad I decided to purchase this album after sampling, instead of Kanye's latest offering.....<br /><br />This is one of the few hip-hop albums to be released within the last 5 years, that I would suggest buying. I practically liked just about every track on the album. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is because I feel like 5 stars are reserved for the true classics/best of the best, but this album isn't that far off.....Overall, I would rate this at 4.5/5 Stars, and suggest this as a definite buy......
B0095P31L6|5.0|Fun movie as a spoof on the Western genre. Clever dialogue, even though it takes a while to really get going.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Loved it! If you like suspense, read this book.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|More than a little fantastic, but a good read. Enjoyable, if thin, character development. Plot twists aplenty keep you on your toes.
B00884GR0W|5.0|okay so they just got a new update and.. ITS FLIPPIN AWSOME. Theve got diff arrows! explosive arrow! cat soul! Shiva boss!  SOOOOO EPiC
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I looked at about...5 other photo editing apps and then I found this one! It works so well! One of my favorite parts about it is the colleges. I love everything about this app!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Good plot, a little suspense, a little romance,well worth watching. A little unexpected twist makes it even better. Glad I chose it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I stopped playing bubble witch about a month ago, until I saw this app! As soon as I saw it I clicked on it and I downloaded it! I'm really glad I did!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|What an adorable movie. These 2 are great on screen. It's a fresh film that goes from good to great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun app. I love that it<br /><br />great app of the day. I love that you have to find and combine objects to solve puzzles. wish there were more levels.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Added this dvd to our collection of The Wizard of OZ movies.  Would recommend to other Wizard of Oz fans.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Heard it was a good so I watched the pilot. It was awesome! Now just finished season #2. Highly entertaining.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! It's well written and well acted. Wish we had more quality shows such as this, bravo.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a challenging game but it is not so frustrating that you need a solution app.  I enjoyed it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|While nothing compares to the first two films for me, this is still a detailed and interesting set to have for fans of the series. The alternate cuts and bonus features are massive and I'm still in the process of wading through it all. For the low price I'd suggest picking it up, even if there's a film or two in the franchise that you're not crazy about. The bonus material more than makes up for it and the transfers look and sound excellent. There's a lot of information and entertainment to be had, as well as some scares and thrills too.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I have enjoyed watching and listening their songs online, and want to support them!  Even my kids love the music
1401234550|5.0|Must read if you are a Geoff Johns green lantern fan.  It continues from the 1st run of green lantern issues by Johns flawlessly.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|Bought this mainly to go with the French version.  My wife and I both found that in either language it was an enchanting, beautiful, though at times a little sad, wonderfully wise imaginary tale
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife is great entertainment. The acting is fabulous and the story line keeps you guessing. It is a great show.
B006XBSAP2|1.0|After her first effort seemed to me a breath of fresh air on the pop music scene, Perry's sophomore return with a sleezy choice for collaborative artists and explicit lyrics pretty much killed her career almost before it started. Too bad, but I just can't see myself adding any Katy Perry to my collection ever again.
0525478817|5.0|Oh my god this book was amazing. I pretty much read through the last one hundred pages before allowing myself to even think about going to sleep. Let me assure you, it is well past my bed time. I met John Green last year and got him to sign The Fault in Our Stars before I realized how big of a deal he actually is and I'm glad I did. I fell in love with him through his VlogBrothers videos before I fell in love with his writing in this book. The man is an artist with his writing. I adore his style and will eventually read his other books as well. I must now wrap up this review because, as I've already stated, it's past my bedtime and I'm now very sleepy. Good night and go read this book!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Not a fan of having to wait for additional lives, but it is free. GOOD response and graphics. Some annoying ads after each game.
B008NMT684|4.0|I would recommend this for children ages 2-3 & maybe younger. Only about 4 pieces per puzzle but the little ones will love it. There are only a few puzzles though & if you want to unlock the others, you have to purchase them.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Is the best way to find and share things that I love with people around the media world. I found interesting, useful and beauties ;)
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Cute chick flick if you really need a chick flick.  As long as you're not &#34;expecting&#34; anything spectacular, it's worth a watch.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is a great book. Hard to put down. Took me a day to read. Nicholas sparks is a great author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a little wary that this book was going to be too political for my taste but found very little of that at all. I could not put this book down! One of my favorite books.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|As with Hosseini's other wonderful novels, the story draws you in and makes you want to know the characters.  Unlike the others, there were too many characters woven into the story and not enough time given to tell each character's story.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This is the first book from Child that i have read and i though it was pretty good. &#34;Im gonna take this right foot and im gonna whop you on that side of your face...and you wanna know something? Theres not a damn thing your your gonna be able to do about it.&#34; -Billy Jack Reacher LOL
B0042RJWTM|1.0|I have purchased 5 different copies of this DVD and &#34;none&#34; will open up on my DVD player?<br />I would like to watch this movie, but so far no luck.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Quality is better than the browser version, but searching seems to limit your results, and you can't seem to search for channels, only videos. The ads are also annoying. I suggest sideloading YouTube app if you know how, but if you don't,this app works okay.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love that you can explore the whole room! Fun game. Very addictive. I wish there were more levels right now!
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is for everyone.  this game is the only one that I play all the time :). I love this game &amp; I hope u like it too. its free you cant beat that.
1250012570|5.0|It's high school and it's tough.  Eleanor has red hair, wears weird outfits, and is a new girl.  Park is half Asian, usually has earphones blocking out everything.  Worse than unpopular, Eleanor is immediate target for bullying, and Park has to edge out of his stay low profile to grudgingly let her sit by him on the bus.  Though there's some anxiety with Eleanor's fraught family situation (crumb-bum guy her mom's hooked up with) and the mean girls at school, overall it's a slow slide into a love story that is totally engaging and beautifully realized.  The book is funny, witty, suspenseful, charming. I got it in the 2p mail and read it straight through to midnight.  Gave to my professor daughter, and she did the same.  Delightful entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really fun to play...a little short (only 10 levels), but it was free and I thought it was very entertaining. I can't wait to see more levels come out!
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Bought this to give to one of my friends for her birthday; we had the OST, but not the reconfigured disk. It's amazing.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I loved playing this game!!!  Kind of eerie music and graphics.  The puzzles were definitely on the difficult side.  I think I finished the game in about a week.  I would love to play longer.  It would be great if there were additional levels available, even to buy not just free.  I would definitely extend the game if it was possible.
B001F4UHEE|5.0|A must see. Every character is absolutely amazing and beautifully acted. Amazing writing, directing and acting all around. Not a surprise that it was nominated for multiple awards.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|this was for the adolescent in the house, a refreshing new sound to me. it came on time & is a staple in the household music list<br />already. a very talented group indeed.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another amazing film from Quentin Tarantino. Every character is absolutely amazing and it is as witty as it is gruesome.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Jack the Giant Slayer<br />114 min<br />Adventure/Fantasy<br />March 1, 2013<br />USA<br />Director: Bryan Singer<br />Writers: Darren Lemke and Christopher McQuarrie (screenplay)<br />Stars: Nicholas Hoult, Eleanor Tomlinson, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci<br /><br />An excellent fantasy movie that the trailers don't do justice, but the reviews will give you a good idea.  This has far more depth than I expected.  Although the special effects are great, the movie has a good story, action, romance, horror, and more.  Loosely following the fairytale \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\", Jack receives magic beans for the sale of a horse (cow in the fairytale), but the similarity ends there.  Oh sure there is an ornate egg, but not solid gold and no goose that laid it.  Nonetheless a great story and script, wonderful casting, exceptional acting, superb directing, excellent  F/X, and lovely music.  Jack's uncle is mad with him taking beans for his horse, and throws them on the floor.  One goes through the floor and grows.  While the princess visits him for an earlier rescue she ends up in his house at the top of a beanstalk in the land of horrible giants.  Jack informs the king and a group of soldiers are sent to rescue her.  So as not to spoil the rest, suffice it to say the movie is well worth viewing and owning and I plan to get the Blu-ray once it drops from the absolutley ridiculous price of about thirty-five dollars to under fifteen dollars.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B0013F1D02 Stardust]], [[ASIN:B003U6BE8I Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief]], [[ASIN:B00DBSZJRM Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters]], [[ASIN:B003RV43X4 Clash of the Titans (2010)]], [[ASIN:B007H7XJD4 Immortals]], [[ASIN:B006TM4H7K Jason And The Argonauts]], and [[ASIN:B000VHVGMI Jack the Giant Killer]] (cheesy by todays standards, but still fun).<br /><br />CA Luster
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting and addictive. Nice, I wish there were more free levels. It was simple at first but as the levels got higher it really got harder. I was stumped on levels 9 and 10 but figured it out.
0761171703|5.0|This is a perfect coffee table book.  I can pick it up and flip through it hundreds of times and not get tired of it.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Rarely does a movie script follow the Bestseller it evolved from like this one! It is nice to see the pages and words from a novel brought to life like The Lincoln Lawyer..
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We just received this for our 4 month old son about a week ago (who is extremely needy and thinks he has to be held or in his ergo 24/7.) He's 26 1/2 inches long and he can JUST reach with his toes (I know a lot of people complain about it not having a min height) the seat turns effortlessly for him (he always gravitates to the musical toy.) The best part of this toy... I can make dinner without baby!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game can drive you crazy.  Keep looking until you find it.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I wanted more levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|totally awesome game! mind blowing cant wait for more rooms to be added!!! will definitely try more games like this! can you escape is great.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|although this switch works ok i'am concerned about it in the long run. it doesn't seem to want to close with a distinctive click and it seems loose when activated.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I was super thrilled (no pun intended) & eagerly anticipating this movie when it was first announced that one of my favorite creators & directors, Zack Snyder would be tackling this newest Superman film iteration. I truly couldn't be happier with this. What's  really great here is that this movie is unlike any Superman flick we've seen before with it's smartly grounded & modern approach that's a clear influence from Nolan & Goyer's successful Batman Trilogy yet their both very different movies. That said, Henry Cavill IS Superman & Amy Adams' Lois Lane is wonderfully re-imagined. Like Clarke's computer program father, this Lois Lane is more like an anchor for Superman throughout the movie as he battles Zod & his cold blooded militant minions who are also excellent in their H.R. Giger armor. In the opening scene, Krypton is wonderfully brought to life as it resembles some sort of primordial dark age meets Flash Gordon, & this was personally one of the real highlights of this movie. The action & awesome battles scenes are dazzling with special effects that are awesome to behold, & a real treat for fans. Zack Snyder's \\"Man of Steel\\" sets out to modernize Superman for a new movie going generation & the legions of comic book fans the world over. Personally, they've done just that. Maybe some purists will hate it but I would think most comic book fans would be most pleased with this latest take. This movie deserves all it's current success.
0767836286|2.0|The film is another in a long line of conspiracy films follwing in the footsteps of 'Parallax View\\" (a much better picture - though that is not saying much).  This film is catastrophically bad.  Bridges, one of our finer actors, turns in his worst performace ever.  His wife has been dead for years and yet he acts as though she died last week.  Perhaps it isn't his fault - consider the lame script he has to work within the confines of.  Robbins fares slightly better as the villain of the piece, though he too seems lost at times, as if he knows he's invested in a bomb (the filmic kind) and can find no way out of the contract.  All is too pat here - the plot, I could swear, creaks through the celluloid.  You want a film with a conspiracy theory watch Stone's JFK (its hold on reality is tenuous at best, but at least it holds one's interest).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best hidden object game lets you get from level 1-10 some are easy but others are hard had fun playing this game
B00005JLCI|4.0|I am, like Claudius, to \\"double business bound\\" in that while I feel this is the best realization on film of this play, it has certain glaring faults that diminish its otherwise superb interpretation.<br />  There is, first, Branagh's portrayal of the Dane himself.  He is at times overly mannered to the point that we see him reaching for an emotion he doesn't seem to feel - witness his \\"O that this too too solid (sullied) flesh. .\\" soliloquy.  One gets the distinct impression that he is focused not on the emotions of his character but rather on where the camera is placed.  Too, his talk with Polonius in 2.1 is thoroughly misguided.  He comes across not as mad, much less as crafty, but rather as smarmy and adolescent.  Gibson does a much finer job with this scene as his Hamlet is more bewildered than juvenile.  Overall, his portrayal lacks subtlety as well as range.  His death scene could be a primer on what actors must never do - show that they are acting.  Both Burton and Finnes are more exciting Hamlets.  Of course there are times when Branagh excels, such as when he drags the hapless Ophelia (played magnificently by Winslet, who, for perhaps the first time in her career keeps most of her clothes on - one indeed sometimes gets the feeling she will only accept roles which allow her to disrobe)around a mirrored room (also a fine directorial flourish - where is the camera?).<br />  As for the other actors - Jacobi as a Claudius who engages our sympathy is, as always, superb.  Richard Briers, who was a disasterous Malvolio in Branagh's first foray into directing Shakespeare (his Malvolio was much too florid, too angry by half) is competent here; Hume Cronyn (in Burton/Gielgud's production) remains, for me, the definitive Polonius.<br />  Now we come to Branagh as director and interpreter of the text.  Having Ophelia read the love letter she received from Hamlet is an injudicious misstep, as is the intercut bedroom scene between she and Hamlet - it serves no purpose. Along the same lines, when Hamlet first spies Ophelia seemingly praying, Branagh plays it as a spurned lover - precisely what he must not do, for if he does Claudius would certainly have to agree with Polonius' assertion that Hamlet's madness is due to Ophelia's not reciprocating his love.<br />  The biggest, most unforgivable mistake Branagh makes is in the last scene.  Just when all of our attention should be focused squarely on Hamlet, Laertes, Claudius, and Gertrude, it is diverted to Fortinbras' attack.  This attack is at odds with the text.  If Fortinbras were attacking Denmark why in the name of all that is holy, would he seems genuinely sorrowful over the many dead bodies he encounters on entering the castle?  It is much more satisfying (and textually accurate) to have Fortinbras simply walk in and take the crown without having lifted a finger - the irony of the situation is delicious - here Hamlet has brooded and brooded and finally after he exacts his revenge and dies Fortinbras, who is a man of action who at first wanted revenge against Denmark for his father's death at the hands of Hamlet's father, gets his revenge by doing precisely nothing.  Branagh, however, botches it.  Not only that, as though there are not enough dead bodies littering the stage, he kills off Osric who, judging by his final words, is killed by a 21 gun salute given by the Norweigians to the British.  I teach this play so I have to carefully explain that the attck on Elsinore Castle makes no sense textually or otherwise.  I am not such a puritst that I believe that a Shakepearean text never be touched.  In Patrick Stewart's Macbeth certain liberties are taken, but they work.  Too, what is that business of Hamlet becoming Errol Flynn bounding down to Claudius on a chandelier?  In short, the final scene is dramatic enough without Branagh inventing drama of his own.<br />  All that said however, the film has great merit.  And any fans of the play would be doing themselves a disservice were they to miss it.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I enjoy historical fiction and this fills the bill. The characters are well developed but flawed. The series held my interest in each show.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|When I found out that Star Trek had another series I jumped at getting these movies. This one certainly lived up to my expectations, with lots of action and interpersonal actions among the main characters. It will hold you on the tip of your seat as the movie builds its theme and actions, and you will certainly enjoy the 'rebirth' of yet another Star Trek series!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I was already on the fence about this movie when it was in theaters. But thought I would give it chance when it came out on dvd. The movie was very slow in the beginning and middle it didn't get exciting until 15 to 20 mins towards the end of the movie.
B0044IABFS|5.0|This a great show and luck that it is free with my prime!!!!!!! There are many seasons of this with prime its free
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game brings back memories of the old time adventure games.  Not overly difficult to solve but challenging enough to be enjoyable.
B008MM9630|5.0|Great game. Love the graphics and sound!  Very fun.  I highly recommend this delightful game!  Lots of animals and plants.  Bright colors.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like this app and would and do recommend it to friends, the only thing that makes me angry is that every time I get on, the same thing happens. it always seems to have a pop up add. although this angers me, I do think that it is fun and definitley addictive!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|way to many subtitles, hated it. needs more humor like the others. subtitles ruin all movies for this slow reader.
B006ZMMBU4|5.0|I'll admit, I cried a few times during this movie, and felt the low ratings it got from critics were undeserved. This video was very heart felt, and it hit a lot of good issues, from how Mumble was parenting, to making a promise and keeping it. I felt that the songs in this movie were well-chosen, and I will admit the beach masters two sons were very cute. While the story may seem very straight forward, there are some rather cerebral issues that are also brought up, such as nations getting along together.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I so love this music that I put it on repeat so I can listen to it for hours and hours.
B007IK44CK|3.0|I kept waiting to get more about the characters and the plot. If I cared about the story or characters, I would still be waiting to get more. Maybe if I had watched earlier ones this one would have made more sense.
B000000OU0|5.0|Do you really need more than that. They are one of my all time favorites and this is my favorite album.
B009G41CG2|3.0|I didn't see a way to change the look of the tiles. Also if there is a way to know when there are no more moves, I didn't find it. I also like to keep track of how many times I have played and the times for each of those; I didn't find a way to do this either.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Fuunyshow. Not all teens live through something like the first episode. My injury wasn't anarm but my right knee. The stories others made up of how I got hurt were amusing. Sadly I am just a klutz.
B009O2XY12|4.0|My son plays this on his iphone and I play on my kindle fire. he has a different version to me. the levels are the same but he has to collect keys to open a chest for his goals, and gets lots of pink gems to use for help on levels. I have tried to find the same version as he has to download.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This is a great buy if you don't happen to have the right accessory to charge your MacBook Air. I decided to buy from amazon instead of the apple store because I wanted to save a drive and I got the accessory the next day!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I was mesmerized by the documentary and wanted the music.  I love the music.  The rhythm, the lyrics, the personal story of Rodriguez, the story of the men who searched for him, the story of the anti-aparthied movement in South Africa.  The combined stories, the music ... it is all so amazing !
B00B7Y0206|1.0|i never got to use it refuses to download and it will not work and i am now really p.oed
B0031RS7X6|4.0|This book makes you wanna live in London, it makes you wanna meet a handsome stranger, and it actually makes you wanna make a complete fool of your self in front of that handsome stranger. It's funny, and a real feelgood book. Sit down under a big blanket with a big cup of tea, and enjoy!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|As an adult I find this game entertaining. When I get bored from the actual task, I just make anything that I can think of and have fun with it. Worth the money.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book kept me reading even though the conditions Sarah, her family and friends experienced were horrible.  The treatment, as demeaning and heartless though it was, seemed in keeping with historical accounts of the Holocaust. The end brought it full circle.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|Don't waste your time. More unwanted plugs than the electric outlets in your house. Bad app. bad app. bad app.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!! It is amazing. One of my favorite games EVERR!!!!! :-D Just know that anyone who says this game is terrible, is lying!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to teenagers and young adults everywhere who like romantic heart wrenching novels. It has a high school setting but never hurts to look back when reading a book.<br />It's brilliantly written and illustrates every chapter beautifully. A great read! 5 stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is so much fun I play it all the time its an awesome mind exercising game and is fun to play with frinds and if your bored its fun to play
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game definitely keeps me occupied and<br />it doesn't cost any money any game like that is good to me.
B007G92QGO|5.0|This novel really forces the reader to question their own parenting. The dilemma faced by any parent when a child is accused of a heinous crime, is it my fault? Was it something I did or didn't do? Did I miss something?  This beautifully crafted novel explores the agonising decisions parents face. There are no finite answers.
193700788X|1.0|What a terrible ending to such an amazing series, its obvious Charlaine Harris Does Not Care About Her Fans!!! This book was such.a.waste.of my money, actually the last 3books.were a huge waste of money and my time reading them. I've bought and read everything she has written, Not Anymore, I wont spend my hard earned money on this ungrateful author ever again
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|My 9 year old and I enjoy playing.  Not so challenging that it becomes frustrating but challenging enough to keep you playing
1936891026|3.0|There was a lot I didn't like about this book. However what I liked was excellent.<br /><br />Though this book is highly geared towards writers, the advice is applicable to anyone that needs to get stuff done without having to report to someone else. Writers and other artist of all varieties, entrepreneurs, business owners... Anyone who has found they avoid what they need to do, procrastinating by whatever mean necessary.<br /><br />The book is broken into three sections.<br />1) Awareness of the problem<br />2) Bottom line, what to do about the problem<br />3) General insanity and nonsense<br /><br />The first two sections are excellent, with my only complaint being they are very repetitive. This can be forgiven by the fact that the material is superbly written, and perhaps hitting a single point from 20 angles helps one to truly \\"grock\\" the point.<br /><br />The third section is truly a nonsense rambling of his beliefs of mysticism and magic (in relation to his writing). I will leave it at that.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Adele's \\"Skyfall\\" is the first single track CD I've bought since a teenager back in the 60's. Once I heard it, I had to have it! \\"Skyfall\\" IS a Bond theme song. Adele IS a Bond theme song singer. She delivers! I've played this CD dozens of times. The melody is haunting, yet invigorating, challenging. The old Bond theme runs through the new melody and lyrics. It's all unified and tightly woven. Perfect!
030758836X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. It literally kept me up because I HAD to know what happened next. Gillian Flynn<br />threw in so many twists and turns that I didn't have a clue as to how it would end until the last page. She's got a new customer in me. Now I'm going to be hard to please with anyone else. Gerry Morgan
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Easy to use, quick as taking a picture, can be emailed or texted from your phone to your computer or to another person. I love this app and use it regularly!
B002O2THRO|4.0|My wife and I saw the current movie version and liked it a lot, so the next day we watched the old one.  In many way the old one is better, but both are really worth seeing.
0525952616|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a friend. He read the book in less than four days and hasn't stopped talking about it since.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this weather app! Easy to use, &amp; fast updates.<br />Even my &quot;weather channel junkie&quot; husband asks me to check this app for local radar.
B005H0IW6W|1.0|Tho a great vocalist, Michael does not come across as being engaged in this CD, it lacks passion. I wished I had not purchased and would not recommend to anyone.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|It's a shame that such a promising game gets tainted with spyware. Let this be a warning to all developers: Most of us read that pesky permissions screen.
1401324649|5.0|A great book, a must read !<br />In a time when such garbage as &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; become  &#34;best sellers&#34;, it' good to read great authors as Jonas Jonasson
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Such a good movie. It is a good action movie, but at the same time very humorous. If you like the Die Hard series, you will probably like this movie as well
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game for your mind. I play it often and am thrilled that it's available on my Kindle.
B0081L391C|5.0|I LOVE this movie. It is absolutely hilarious. If you like Due Date, or any of the Hangover's you will probably enjoy this movie to the fullest.
B007REV4T8|5.0|SKYFALL WAS ENTERTAINING, FULL OF ACTION, NEVER BORING.  I LIKED THE WAY HE'S DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF GADGETS TO DEAL WITH AND ALSO, THAT IT SHOWED MORE ABOUT HIM, WHY HE BECAME 007. I ALSO MUST SAY WHEN I HEARD IN THE BEGINNING, THAT DANEIL CRAIG WOULD BE DOING THE 007s.  I WAS MORE THAN A BIT SKEPTICAL.  BUT NOW, IN MY BOOK:  HE IS 007.  GREAT JOB MR. CRAIG.  ALSO, BECAUSE HE'S SUCH AN ACTION FIGURE AND THINK MAYBE SOMETIMES HIS ACTING ABILITY IS OVERLOOKED.  HIS AC ACTING IS DEFINITELKY NOT BAD EITHER.  I LOVED THE SCORE SANG BY ADELE.  I'VE WATCHED THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER.  IT'S ALWAYS JUST AS EXCITING AS WHEN I WATCHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.  YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT TOO MANY MOVIES.  I EVEN LIKE THE NAME &#34;SKYFALL' EVEN THOUGH IT WAS LATER THAT I FOUND OUT IT WAS THE NAME OF HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS SMALL.  THE ONL;LY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE MOVIE WAS WHAT HAPPENED WITH 'M'..  I HADN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT AND WAS TAKEN COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE.  SHOCKED WOULD BE MORE LIKE IT!  I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES ACTION, A GOOD ADVENTURE, AND 007 MOVIES. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A 007 FAN, I STRONGLY YOU SEE RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.  ITS EXCELLENT!
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Good movie, good actors, plot, and effects. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes or enjoys the Star Trek shows or movies.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Its a GREAT game for any one! You don't even have to pay. I love it's so much I play it every day
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wraiths of Eden is one of the best games of this type I have ever played!  The graphics and dialog are wonderful and you really get lost in the story.  Its worth the price.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|First, let me just say that I am not someone who watches much TV (unless it's sports).  However,  Downton Abbey is the exception,  my wife and I love to watch it together.  The character development is excellent,  which makes love some characters and hate some of the characters.  The Amazon Instant Video version is excellent quality with no playback issues.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Movie disappointed a bit, since it did not live up to its Oscar nomination hype. Acting was mediocre at best and ending was predictable.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great characters who are well fleshed out.  Exciting NYC/ Manhattan backdrop for the setting. The stories moves along with clear definition and with plausibility. Despite the abundance of self involved, egocentric characters, there is an underlying moral theme and a sense of empathy.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|What a wonderful program! Wish there were more seasons to watch. Love the characters in the show. Too bad series was canceled.
B008N1V11U|4.0|this game is definitely awesome you can fly if you have a kindle fire this game is the perfect game for you
B000FCKGPC|3.0|It took about half the book to get through the backstory but it picked up at last. Still if you've read the previous three books you owe it yourself to bear through this one. Cersei, Jaime, Brienne, Arya, and Sansa have important roles but don't dismiss the importance of the Iron Islanders and Martell's, the latest pivot in the series.<br /><br />I'd give AFFC 3.5 stars though this app only allows whole ratings.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is amazing because it's exactly like texting and that's how I talk to all my friends because I don't have a phone ;p
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Have been a Mac owner since 1991.  Alway knew he was very different and has accomplished amazing results with all his efforts.  But after reading the book, I learned so much more about him.  He will go down in history as a man to study.  Highly recommend this book.  Very well written.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Fun at first...but by level 45 you need to spend real world dollars to buy fake dollars. You will never own a TRex unless you are willing to part with $20. You can gain a zillion coins but you cannot use those to buy dollars. My advice find a hack for infinite dollars and coins so you can actually create the park you want to.
1591845556|5.0|Effectively guides you through the skill acquisition process. This was a life changing book for me. It helped me to clarify my goals and schedule the time to progress and achieve things I've dreamed of doing. I like that the author was right up front about the format of his book, explaining that everything I need is in the first three chapters and that the rest of the book describes his experience of reaching personal goals using the 20 hour plan. While some of his goals are not my personal goals, I found it interesting and helpful to hear his stories.<br />If you get a chance, watch Josh Kaufman's TEDTalk. Wonderful!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|It seemed like the actors were directed to take on the old-fashioned, over the top style of acting of the original movie, but it just didn't fit.  The effects were right on the money, but the script, direction, and acting just made it awkward, and, at times, annoying.  The longer the movie took, the angrier I became.  I was really hoping to go somewhere over the rainbow in a new way, but it failed to get me to leave my couch.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Season 5 of Mad Men really dives deep into dark waters, and for this reason I found it a tougher watch than in previous years. The tone gets almost oppressive in places, with an almost visceral nihilism that far outweighs even the darkest moments of earlier episodes. But that's really the arc of Mad Men; the loss of innocence, the shaking up of the world order that makes the 60s such a compelling decade in which to examine the evolution of American society. And this season also contains perhaps one of the finest [and certainly one of the most expensively-scored] sequences in television history, involving Don, his young new wife, Megan, and a Beatles LP. So much meaning packed into two-and-a-half short minutes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like a lot of games but this is probably my favorite game ever. u can fight monsters like creepers spiders skeletons and zombies. build any thing u want. and with the upgrade 0.7.1 u can chat to people that are around u.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|WOW! I'm still trying to recoup. Travis and Abby.... two broken young kids by their growing up in a somewhat dysfunctional environment and lack of love meet in college and find what they have been missing in each other., but not without drama. Although the story pooled me in to read further into these 2 characters it was sad to think that similar situations are real to life. We are all broken somehow, but finding our happiness may come hardest and with more challenges to some.. if ever. Happy Travis and Abby found true love in each other after living such a hard life., but I would had liked for the epilogue to go further into their future to see Travis become someone making a difference with his degree in Criminal Justice, no longer fighting for money and happy with the man he worked so hard to become at Abby side.....<br /><br />Perhaps a short novella could be in your future works Mrs. McGuire!?!
B00003CXBK|5.0|One of the best anime films ever. A must have for any collector of amine (otaku). Or for anyone to be honest.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I like Maggie Smith in almost anything, but this was a surprisingly powerful, funny, tender and sweet look into the lives of the elderly who 'have been somebody', and a great directorial debut by Dustin Hoffman.  Bravo to cast, crew and director!
B00122IVQA|5.0|I've always loved RHCP and this album gives me yet another reason to like them more. I understand that this isn't exactly the most helpful review, but I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys listening to RHCP's tunes.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Over the past few years my computers have begun to get louder (fan). I never gave thermal compound much thought until I started reading about reasons computers are noisy. After cleaning, then applying Arctic Silver, I noticed an immediate difference on both machines. I should've done this sooner.
B0046LUH20|3.0|This was very long drawn out romance novel about an older woman in love with a college student.  It was dull and the characters were just not likable.  Average read if you like romance.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|helps me sleep at night. I cant relax with out it. Its the best app yet. would diffently recommend to anyone having problems sleeping.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy Tintin as much as I did. I had not read the stories before so was not really sure of the plotlines, etc. But I truly enjoyed the animation, characters and the story.
B004TI1WME|4.0|it does was a calculator is suppose to do.  I can't complain would recommed it.  easy to see and easy to use.
6304925131|1.0|VHS tape was defective. Wobbled. Picture was unwatchable. I returned it and got my money credited. I'd reconsider the provider.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|After reading the book, and seeing the movie in a theater, I needed to be able to watch & replay segments. Personally, I think reading the book before seeing the movie helped me follow it much better.
B00C1S9C3U|5.0|Watch Season 2 Episode 21 \\"Peak Performance\\" this episode is based on the Kobayashi Maru and the best ST: TNG up to this point. It illustrates the philosophic basis for Star Trek in general and is one of the most entertaining episodes. I hope to add to this review as I watch more.
B00C061I3K|3.0|I've been listening to Techno since 1992 and spent 13 year touring America as an artist in the industry.  This album is a hybrid of modern day disco lounge music.  It lacks the raw 'house' vibe of their earlier productions.  It is still good for listening to on a long drive and it's hard for such a legendary group to top their earlier work.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Nile Rodger's guitar makes this song.  Thr lyrics are great.  What could be better than being 25 years old, single,  and spending a Friday night trying to get lucky.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|I'm a obit fan of Gaiman's and have enjoyed everything I've read by him. This book surprised me. It wasn't what I expected but that didn't deter my enjoyment in reading it. It takes a skilled and adept writer to create a world that's so real when so much of it doesn't exist and is up to the author to portray. Gaiman's does this effortlessly, creating characters you're genuinely interested in. I only wish it were longer.
B008P3SPVU|2.0|Well it is just another one of those sports motivation films. I have seen so many of these that I think I could start writing them. They must be easy to make....the good this is that it was free!
B00932DCS8|4.0|This is very much worth watching. A nice suspense film. Well written and directed. I won't give any details of the movie because it would ruin it for some,  just watch you will be surprised at the end
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J. Cole of course did his justice of putting out a great album.<br />Personal and very narrative it was not a disappointment.  Especially, \\"Let Down Nas\\" gave an insight to how much Nas has meant to him becoming the upcoming MC he is now. Have to give kuddos to J. Cole for always delivering master pieces the best way he can.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Fun, better story than expected.  Couple at center of story made it goofy and off-beat to watch.  Nice alternative to usual zombie stuff, which I love.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|I liked the story, which is re-telling what happens to Batman after he tries to retire from crime fighting.  This is a story that has been re-told many times and involves yet another version of how the Bat ensures his legacy will continue beyond himself.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|My wife is really into dramas like this but I sat down with her and started watching and have to say, got hooked. Authentic and good viewing, I have to say.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Why does a subpar game app need to know my GPS coordinates?  Avoid apps like these, even when they're free.  You are paying with your privacy.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|I did not like this app and I removed it off my reader. Something a child might like.  Thats all
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Title says it all really, look forward to more. I enjoyed the cameos from the Justice league too. Voice actors were perect.
1609611543|5.0|My husband and I read the book and decided right away to go wheat free.  Neither of us are very over weight.  We both exercise regularly and try to watch our calories.  We just can't get right of the &#34;belly&#34;.  After being on the wheat free diet for a month, we've both lost inches in our mid-section and we have lots of energy.<br /><br />Dr. Davis was extremely thorough in explaining how much wheat is harming us.  The facts just don't lie.  We're committed to continue on this diet the rest of our lives.  We are convinced we will be healthier and able to do the things we want to physically.  We're both in our late 60s.<br /><br />This is an excellent read for everyone, no matter what your age!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Just started playing it and have to find out about the controls.  It is very easy to lose control to quick and make you want to not play!  Patience and I will keep trying!
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Two thumbs up!  Love Barbra and love Seth!  This was such a good movie, I would recommend it to anyone!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed the book trilogy and the movie was very true to book one. The premise is unlikely but, in my case the movie brought the characters to life in a colorful way.  The ending leaves the door open to book two.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Would someone who actually viewed this on blu-ray actually review the movie in that format?  Is this version worth purchasing?  Thank you.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am on facebook alot and always had to go the web site type in facebook and then download the link now I just hit the app and bingo its right there.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I like reading this book, Classic science fiction in a brand new universe. Fight with aliens and thinking on what is the humanity.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love hitting the app and there is google now don't have to go to web site and look for the link and then download each and everytime I need it
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book is pretty great. I was amazed to find out just how much goes into the food industry--and how much of that was going on in the area i grew up in! It's definitely worth a read.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another insightful story about the struggles in Afghanistan from this great author. Being a parent , this reached into my heart and I felt for all those parents who are in such a position to have to choose which child to give up. Or, in fact just to have to give up a child!!<br />I have read all three books of Khaled Houssini. Great work to bring focus of these problems to the world.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|Just saw the film a few days ago - and the one thing I missed was the emotional euphoria and pull of the original score by Williams. Hans Zimmer is such a talented composer - Hannibal, The Thin Red Line, The Ring, Inception - I mean he could have made this memorable, but instead we get something lackluster; and that is the perfect summation of his score for Man of Steel. What is memorable here? Superman was Super with Johnny Williams score and I don't think that should have changed. Keep the theme of the music the same and adapt it to the retelling of the Superman story. It would have worked.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|I tried to find a rating(UNRATED) or review before we went to see this and I was sorely disappointed to find a bunch of bad reviews, but they were all coming from adults. I wanted to know if this would be OK for my children to watch. So here is a review from a MOM.<br /><br />My girls liked this movie, and I didn't feel bad about taking them. I didn't feel like I had to hide their eyes at any point, or remove them from the theater. Yes they had somewhat skimpy clothes, and Applejack straddling a chair in a skirt was a little over the top(nothing obviously showing), not something I want my girls doing, and that is why I knocked off half a star, but I come from the 80's gen that grew up with Barbie and Jem in short skirts, and Teela and She-ra running around in cheek hugging bathing suits, and I turned out to be a fairly conservative parent.  So really it's not that big a deal.<br /><br />It was a genuinely good for kids kind of movie though, and taught about friendship, dealt with bullying(and standing up to one), and good overcoming bad. Being a parent does require being involved and talking about these things, and I'd say seeing this movie is a good segue into talking about these things to young girls.  The 'scary' part wasn't too bad, my 4yo was fine<br /><br />Short skirts and all(not even too short), I WOULD get this for my young daughters. So if you are on the fence about whether or not to get this for your daughter, I would give this movie a G for great!
B002O1TMI4|5.0|I'm way behind the curve on this one, but I just listed to the whole thing nearly four years after its original release, and aI was blown away. Muse has stepped it up to a new level here.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did! More than just an action flick, it was a smart thriller!<br />So good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fantastic game. That I do t mind playing every day I love the fact that u have to focus n go fast on this game n the fact u can change close on here
B009DKFSUA|5.0|This is a CD that I want to listen to when I need energy - like when I was driving to a job interview the other day. Makes you happy!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Always a good read from Lee Child. He always s has you guessing with his twists and turns. This is a good one. You won't be disappointed
B006QVRVJK|5.0|I watched it once from Red Box and like it, but they had no more copies, so I bought it here. It is a Drama with great actors, and as the plot thickens and a few drinks, it becomes very funny. Highly recommended.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Book will go down a storm in the US but referring to Iraqies as savages not nessessary. Very one sided. Its an interesting book to see the view of a combat soldier in the war. Wifes thoughts a good adition.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use and understand! It is very accurate and the radar tool keeps me updated. I recommend this application. No issues were found.
B005LAII12|3.0|I saw this movie Ted on Lap top I thought it was very cute and funny so I decided to get this DVD for HD flat screen TV so I would enjoy it so much more.  I plan on lending it to my family members.  It is not a kids movie it is more adult showing it is very funny.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Whole family loves this game.  See how is at the highest level and who can earn the most money. Fun for all ages
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I love Nickelback I have all there CD's even my younger brother are in to them.  They rock they sound a bit like other groups
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|A little boring. Nothing but cutting hair, coloring hair,shaving heads, and putting accessories on. It could get a lot better.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|I do not know why so many people disliked this film. The acting was really good (not great but I only hold that opinion for great actors), the action was flawless (not too much but not too little and flowed well), the story and romance was good too. I am not a history buff but from what I remember and know this film is fairly accurate with the obvious exception for the fictional characters. The product arrived safely and timely. It was great on blu-ray. I recommend everyone watch this.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Fun and thrilling many weapons to choose from many action packed levels I love being able to use the at-at against planes
B005LAIGNC|4.0|The product itself is great. It was well packaged and arrived on time. The film itself was good. The acting was a little poor but the planes and action scenes were great. If you like fighter plane movies this is a good one to watch. It is not just about the action though. This movie incorporates the struggles (not as much as other movies) these pilots had to face.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|this game is so fun. its worth the money.if you like monkeys and boxing then this is the game for you.so get it now.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|This is an enjoyable feel good movie. It could have been much better with an improved script. The director underestimates the intelligence of its audience and therefore allowed the script to falter at times. A few very good performances, especially by Maggie Smith & Bill Connoly & Pauline Collins. They pull the movie to a higher level.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I loved the first JJ Abrams Star Trek movie and couldn't wait for film 2. This time round, we decided to take our children(11&13) not knowing what they would think because they showed no interest in the series on tv when they were little. Before the film, I didn't want to give our kids the scoop on the film for fear of the tween and teen eye rolling contest and the: \\"I am bored already\\". It was a risk I had to take because I loved the first JJ Abrams Star Trek movie....After the film, my oldest asks if we can watch every episode in the original Star Trek series! YES! It is wonderful that Star Trek Into Darkness sparked an interest in our children. They loved the movie as much as me: the characters and their conflicts, the colors, the sets, aliens, non-stop action, the lens flares, the enterprise, the story,,,,Kirk saying: \\"I just wants to rip the f---- bangs off Spock\\"(kirk doesn't swear there, if you are worried). Funny! I loved the original Star Trek series when I was a kid and this new Star Trek movie brings back all the fun and adventure I felt as a kid watching the original Star Trek series. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fantastic modern recreation of the original Star Trek series. I can allow the new actors of the JJ Abrams Star Trek movies be the nearly perfect reincarnation of the original cast. Chris Pine is a fabulous Captain Kirk! Spock is Spock! My kids laugh at Scotty and Bones -wow, it works for me, my husband and now with my kids. We saw the film 4 times in the theaters and my kids say that's not enough! Thanks to JJ Abrams. Now, JJ can't stay too long with Star Wars! He needs to get back to the Star Trek universe soon!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Have to say that this is one of the better bond films in a very long time. I have seen them all, this one had as much or more action and gave more depth to the Bond character than ever before. Really liked this film , if you are a Bond fan it is a must have. If you liked the Bourne movies or Die hard movies this is for you.<br />Oh! four stars , why not five. I don't know, did not like the graphics on the box . I gave Avatar 3D five stars.
B000VMIILU|5.0|The movie is in excellent condition, no problems with shipping.  And of course we love the movie, especially after just being in Spain and seeing some of the actual places in the movie and also seeing Columbus's grave site in Seville!
B009NY43NY|2.0|SPOILER ALERT -don't read this review if you want to be surprised!  First, to say that I totally enjoyed these books up until Deadlocked.  After that one, I had to get this one from the library because I could not let myself pay for a book that was going where this one went.  I had hoped to be wrong and then I would have bought it from Amazon to have in my library and enjoy over and over.  I can't do that.<br /><br />Did Ms. Harris really write this?  It doesn't seem so.  We loved Sookie.  Bill, Eric and Sam loved Sookie.  Quinn and Alcide sort of loved Sookie.  Where did all of that that was built up over all those books go?  This book is filled with boring little vignettes of what she is cooking for breakfast or drinking or deciding to wear.  As though there was a minimum word count due and just write anything down to complete it.<br /><br />While Sookie ended up with the person I felt she would from the first book on, and I think Ms. Harris tried to show that, it was arrived at poorly.  I felt she had used the cluviel dor at the end of Deadlocked because she loved him and couldn't bear the world to be without him, but that is not made clear or carried into this book.  And we had known all along that he loved her, it wasn't just friendship.<br /><br />The story line begins to show that while Sookie loves Eric, she doesn't want to be turned by him.  She wants a real life.  That wasn't developed.  Eric could have shown that he loved her by letting her go, knowing that Sam would be there to give her the life she wanted and needed.  Instead he comes off as power hungry and mostly selfish, dumping her when she won't go along with just occasionally being available for him.  And then he is vindictive to boot, maneuvering it so she and Sam can't be together.  That's not the character that had been developed for Eric.<br /><br />So many relationship strings were left untied.  I felt that perhaps the television studio producing True Blood controlled what Ms. Harris could and could not do with this book.  What a pity.  We could have all been sad that Sookie and Eric couldn't have a fulfilled relationship, yet glad that Sookie finally recognized love and a life with Sam.<br /><br />Although this is the last Sookie Stackhouse novel, there is another book to reveal how things turned out for the characters.  Is this an attempt to make up for what was definitely lacking in this book?  Or just an attempt to get a little more money out of this series?
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Love this human drama/comedy! Under rated by Oscars. Many outstanding performances and a great story with a well paced direction.
B00B29J0I6|2.0|Imagine Cut the rope with boards and crates instead of ropes.  That is this game.  I was not impressed, but I'm sure many others out there will enjoy it.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I don't know why I am taking time to write a review. My words seem so lost when compared to the majesty of Phantom. I have seen it on Broadway, have seen the movie, and now this occasion captured for us to enjoy again and again. I know there are people who call it sappy, but if it elevates your soul for just a little while and transforms an otherwise empty evening into a magical night at the theatre, then perhaps we need this guilty pleasure in our lives--because, yes, I cry every time and enjoy every tear.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A must read for all of us extroverts who associate introversion negatively giving a strong rationale for compassion and self-awareness toward self and others
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game.but short<br />.would like it to be longer as it was becoming more challenging<br />.but over all a great game
0446554995|4.0|I really love Agent Pendergast books, especially listening to them. The most recent narrator is wonderful with his accents and really helps you feel like part of the story. I was saddened by the story line (no spoilers). There is a new antagonist involved. All in all, I really enjoyed my trip through this book and look forward to future installments.<br /><br />People seem to be disappointed in the fantastical nature and 'Indiana Jones' types stunts in these books. My question is, how did they get this far in this series if they did not appreciate this type of writing. Loved the book and the more I learn of Pendergast, the more I feel for him.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|The game is very entertaining and not that repetitive. I like the game alot, suitable for all age groups. Will play it for a while.
B008602KQI|5.0|Action packed movie. The cast all played their parts per designed roles in the movie. The plot of the movie was well established.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Perfect flick for those days when you're in the mood for a classic love story.  Always something new to discover!
B0096BIENY|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I saw them live a few weeks ago and so many of the songs they perform are on The Greatest Hits CD.  If you are a fan of IL DIVO, this is for you. Their rendition of Ava Maria and Don't Cry For Me Argentina brings tears and  chills every time I play the CD.  You won't be sorry if you make this purchase.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is a fun show with a solid cast. I am looking forward to catching up on Seasons two and three.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love how the Sir Artur Conan Doyle characters and story lines have been brought into the 21st century. The twists and turns are some much fun. More than once I stayed up too late, watching just one more episode...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. perfect for puzzle lovers! I have been addicted to it all weekend. you must try it!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Amazing!!! first car charger that charges very fast a phone even if you charge two phones at the same time both charges very fast
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This show was recommended to my by two friends. I was hooked after just a few minutes. I really like being able to watch all the episodes whenever I want.
B005VPRET4|4.0|Bought it for my grandkids and they loved it.  It added to the already purchased set from Friends line.  Keeps the kids busy, interested and happy for long periods at a time.  Wholesome and fun LEGO item.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I do love a good surprise ending! I was guessing right up until the end. Very well written with several twists and turns. I only wish that wonderful surprise ending had been a little more detailed to leave me with less questions about the future of the characters.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|love this game! makes u really think and use your brain.  hope they continue they to add new levels soon! I am almost to the end.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Well worth the wait.  A very fitting bookend to a career of the most influential metal musicians in history.  Heaviest CD in decades.  Bottom line if you love Black Sabbath you we love this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great brain teased. even my five yearold daughter was able to help and solve some of the puzzles. cant wait for more levels.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|For you Columbo, (Peter Falk), fans...this series is excellent.  The guest stars are also such a treat...among them is Robert Culp, and many others to numerous to mention in this review.  Enjoy !
B00AB7HESI|1.0|it wont let me download it im super mad my brother has it but it wont let me download waste of money dont buy
B005DJREJS|5.0|Akward is such a pleasant surprise.  Who can't relate to the trials and tribulations of being an &#34;akward&#34; high school kid?  This is a very well acted and written comedy that has the ability to feel real.  It pulls at your heartstrings as Jenna goes through the drama of high school, fitting in and still staying true to herself.  In the meantime, it is seriously funny with many laugh out loud moemts in every episode.<br /><br />It feels contempory while still paying homage to the &#34;Sixteen Candles&#34; type John Hughes movies of the 80's.
B005LF9IO8|3.0|Thought it would have a better story line to it.  Wouldn't recommend this movie.  Look for a better action movie.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Excellent film, the history of a great studio, music from the 70's on, and whats wrong with digital music. A lot of credit to Mr. Grohl for one hell of a film.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Needed an adapter with the Prolific chipset, went to Amazon and found this fit the bill. Used it to replaced a borrowed one. Plugged it in, rebooted the computor and it worked perfectly. Very happy with the purchase.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game. You will have so much fun solving the puzzles on each of the floors. Enjoy the way you think. You will live each time you solve a floor and be ready for the next.
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|Very good restart album and these songs rock. I sort of like Ronnie better, but Ozzy back with Black Sabbath is in my opinion better than a lot of other music out there and refreshing.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Great family movie.  My son loved it and it was fun for the adults too.  I wish there were  more like it.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|awesome movie. Funny, gritty, brutal, and actually kind of touching in it's own twisted way.<br /><br />Buy a copy, you won't regret it.
B001OQCV2O|2.0|Indeed, this is a great movie, great special effects and acting, but no subtitles in other languages I was needing spanish I was very upset when I saw that the movie didn't bring them. Of coursde it was my fault not to see the full specifications of the product, but I buy a lot of movies from amazon and all of them are designed for other regions that do not speak in english; a movie in blu ray must have all the subtitles and audio tracks.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Classic story with a bit of a twist. The visuals were excellent the acting was good, yes its a bit predictable, but then again its a classic story. Overall it was an entertaining movie that was a classic hero's quest and it moved along fast and you didn't have to think to much, just watch and enjoy.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Worthy of all it's Academy Awards. Great performances. Did not realize the late great James Gandolfini played Leon Panetta until the credits rolled. Even knowing how it turned out the suspense was palpable.
B0097HC8MK|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, but I'm sure I'll see it again.  The story is very difficult to watch, but it rings true.  The acting is superb.  It opens one's eyes to things that are all around, but no one is seeing.  A true masterpiece.  But so very, very hard to watch.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Mount Rushmore. Cross country intrigue. Crop duster scene a classic. My favorite movie.
B008V8FVTI|5.0|It's hard to say you love a movie this disturbing, but I did. It is a movie that will make you think --  what would I do? -- how would I deal with this abuse?  Well done, well acted.  There is no right answer.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|I can't turn it off. Lots of fun, plenty of achievements to complete. Gets a little repetitive after awhile though.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Matt Damon and Danny Devito, who would have thought. And then you add the grown- up Claire Danes.  And a story by John Grisham -- this couldn't fail and it certainly doesn't.  You put your money on the kid and he follows though.  A remarkable story very well told on the big screen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was hoping this was better than 100 floors.  So with it.  It is challenging, but fun.  Lots of memorizing, searching and clues.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|The cd got to my house very fast and it looked great! My wife listens to it everyday and I am happy when she is happy!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is amazing! How is it even a FREE game? Forget those other MLP games where you have to find a muffin or jump over stuff to get to some.... uhhh....thing. This is a REAL game. It has story and characters and SO MUCH CONTENT. Its not like that other CRAP. This is a game. The other ones are like...like... Waving something shiny in front of a toddler  to give them something to do for an hour! And yes, parents. I Kimiknow the reason your getting this game probably to do exactly what l just said the other game does and that's fine with me because its FREE and the other one isn't, which i think is REALLY stupid since they barely have ANY content WHATSOEVER! ANYWAYS this review is for the BRONYS. all the BRONYS. nothing but the BRONYS.... and teenage girls but still, ITS FOR THE BRONYS! But seriously you should get this game
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Sub way surfers you should play it it's amazing it gets u hundreds of coins and u can unlock stuff
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock character reminds me of a cross between Robert Downey Jr's version of Sherlock and Hugh Laurie's character House.  Martin Freeman's portrayal of Dr. Watson as Sherlock's able assistant is excellent.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would probably be shocked at how well his characters can be modernized, yet still maintain so much of their original character and charm.  Try it and you will probably find yourself watching every episode.
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|The book deals with a serious problem humorously and compassionately, reveals the difficulties of &#34;Aspies&#34;, and has an optimistic happy ending!
B001TH16DI|4.0|The only thing that I do not like about the films is that they are not in full screen and maybe that is the only way that they can format it. The movies are great and they are very clear.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game play it all the time would recommend this to all my friends this a four star game  need more stuff to do
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use.  It didn't take all day to figure it out as it dose on some of the<br />calculators I've seen
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|It may be one of the best productions PBS has ever aired!  The the actors, the direction, and the screenplay are excellent in every sense of the word. I can't wait to add Series 4 to my collection.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series is really awesome. My husband and I are addicted. We watch an episode every night! This is a great TV.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked the levels available. Interesting mini games within each level. I would have rated higher if there were more levels.
B00005JKGK|3.0|Unfortunately, this disc arrived with (minor) scratches on it, but it still played.  The movie itself is one that everyone should have in their collection, because it reminds us of the struggles that mothers go through to give their daughters a  better life than they had, especially mothers who are immigrants from another country, and that we all have roots deeper than we imagine.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Just a great game it makes time fly I like having the the the the the the seeds<br /><br />The seeds are awesome it's so cool it's . Listed k e summing up greatness in one seed.
1426308469|5.0|Incredibly informative to young and old minds.  Beautiful illustrations too. Well organized and a great introduction to dinosaurs. Highly recommend it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game! Good for fine motor and visual skills. I enjoy playing the game. It also relaxing for the mind. Colors match up are great and challenging.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Quality was good but too expensive compared to for example movieberry. Needed to download 2 eposodes that would not download correctly for falling skies. Cost here is 50percent more
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Only 4 stars just because I am very attached to Google Reader. I think the issue is text versus graphics. I am text focused when reading blogs and Feedly is a bit too graphics focused for me.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|This is one of the Best Scary, movie I've seen in a long time . The overwhelming Emotions it brings out within yourself, is amazing. You hunger for more, as you anticipate another heart stopping moment. The Good kind! I've wStched over a dozen times already and can't wait to watch again. Every viewing you find something else you didn't notice before. Five Star!!!
B008QE9XD2|1.0|WTF!  Johnny Depp and Tim \\"lost it\\" Burton were supposedly big Dark Shadows fans.  They lie.  That's the only way I can justify their making this awful, awful movie.  Dark Shadows succeeded because it took itself seriously and that is where good camp comes from.  If they wanted to play that up, they should have gone Ed Wood style.  This is a monstrosity.  Poorly cast, horrible screenplay ... a big mess.  Michelle Pfieffer is the only one who did not make me throw things at the TV.  Avoid at all costs if you've ever seen or enjoyed the original.  What a horrible opportunity wasted,  Get House of or Night of Dark Shadows instead.  And pray Tim Burton gets his groove back and divorces Helena Bonham Carter cuz I'm sick to death of her.
193700788X|1.0|After reading 12 books of this fascinating story, Charlaine Harris gives me this... A very disappointing conclusion to one of my favorite book series. I won't spoil anything for anyone but I must say that it was sloppy and mediocre.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a banquet of words, so beautifully written, I was left wanting it to continue forever. Do not miss this splendid read. Savor every morsel!
B000244FDW|4.0|This version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was probably the earliest one. There were no actors that I recognized. It was well done; but the costumes were quite different than the other versions. I bought it to complete my collection of \\"Pride and Prejudice!\\"
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game. Keeps you interested. Just be aware that you have to purchase the full version. Other than that great game
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page and held me until the last page. It was hard to read some of the things he wrote, but I know it was a story that needed telling. Strong women inhabit this book!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Sony did Lawrence of Arabia fans justice with this blu-ray set. As noted in the product description, the set includes a \\"making of\\" book, the soundtrack, a film frame, and loads of extras. The film itself looks great in blu-ray. I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but there does seem to be significantly less grain or noise in the blu-ray picture. Some fans might not like that as it might not look quite like the Lawrence they all know and love, but it really helps bring out the stark colors in the movie.<br /><br />THIS is how you do a collector's edition of a blu-ray movie. I only wish more studios gave their films this level of love and attention (Lucasfilm, I'm looking at you!). If you love this movie, this set is a must.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Too many stories of other individuals were left hanging. Very disjointed, especially after reading \\" A Thousand Splendid Suns\\". I plan on reading \\"kite Runner\\" soon. Mr. Hosseini is definitely one of the most gifted authors I have read recently.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|simple format with good numeric of puzzles most are hidden object.easy to stopand pick back up but touch control not nearly sedative enough
B005BOHYW2|5.0|A story of love in all its disguises.  Hidden meanings and triumph of the soul in the face of adversity.
0345803485|5.0|First off, I'm sick of reading all the \\"one star\\" reviews. Really? Obviously this book is massively popular for a reason. I can't tell you how many women I know who have said they're secretly in love with CG! Personally, I've read the series more than once, lol. No, it's not classic literature and it's not going to win any awards for best writing, but you know what, who cares?? Honestly, people need to lighten up a little. Yes, her writing style can be somewhat annoying and repetitive, but so what? I still loved it!! We also know that Christian Grey doesn't exist and is too perfect to be real...but a girl can dream. ;)
B007B5EDEG|3.0|This popular book is well constructed and enjoyable but has far too many characters to keep track of and the author did not know when to finish.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|It just wasn't good. Nothing about it was any good. A total waste of time. Stick with the original. Pass.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|That is all that needs to be said. This series is amazing.  Writing is top notch, and story keeps u wanting more.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Costumes, plot, actors, and all the best the English have to offer.  If you liked the original you will love the latest installment.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I wonder what I would REALLY do if I were in the position to either \\"STAND BY MY MAN\\" or tell him to take a jump off a high cliff when confronted with his infidelities, especially with the world watching.  Ms. Margulies does a super job portraying a woman in this circumstance.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoyed working the puzzles but thought the offerings limited without spending additional $, otherwise fun!  Will leave it on my Kindle for a while and might be re-challenged by the original puzzles
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It give it 5 stars because I am so addicted to the story!  I have found myself dreaming about it and looking forward to the next time I have a moment to sit and watch an episode!
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I didn't jump on the twilight bandwagon during all the hype but after watching one of them on tv, I was hooked. They were all very good. This one was excellent, graphic but still easy to watch.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is challenging and the graphics are very nicely done.  I can't say anything negative about this game.  Good job to the guys who created it!
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|The magic of her voice has never ceased to captivate me. Her gift is like no other artist, in any genre. The album is crafted flawlessly and it makes my heart and soul sing. 'A' is the unexpected reward after so many years of being a true fan of ABBA. I love Agnetha, I love ABBA, and I love this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game was great, but it was way too short.  I would have like to play longer.  I also wish the puzzles were a little more challenging.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thought the book was very good. Kept me entertained the whole way. The way it was written was different from any other book I've read. Highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun and very entertaining game.The reason I rated it 4 out  of 5 stars is there is an ad that takes a couple seconds to load and takes you away from the game for a couple of seconds and can be quite annoying. The first couple of times I thought that my kindle had shut down. Other than that it is a very good and fun game.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|My husband and I love strange humor and we found this movie to be highly entertaining!  it was so well done and I think maybe some people just don't understand the type of sarcasm and humor used in the film.  We were cracking up the whole time.  Loved it!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I could not put the book down.  This book is one every American should read.  This young man was amazing .  Read the book.  May God bless him and his family.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more rooms. This game is awesome. Update soon please :) we have so much fun with it. Yippee
B003M6EAXM|4.0|For an enterprise that wasn't sure whether they would make another season, I found the ending a little deflating. Now that I know that another season will come out, it makes the ending a little bit lighter.
B000P6PVLC|4.0|This movie was well-made and well-acted.  It was a bit stressful to watch.  Sort of like Crash, but not as specifically focused on racism.
0811875555|5.0|I love the book. It's better than any other Disney art book I've read so far. The book came early and was in great condition.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was looking for a good science fiction book and I found it in this story with interesting characters a good story line and interesting plot. I would recommend.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Don't miss this Classic Movie, I mean the Movie is over 30 year's old,and still gives you Cold veins. Very good performance by Jamie lee curtis. Recommend this Movie to all who loves horror!  /regards John
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is an enjoyable and highly informative read appropriate for anyone interested in how and why habits develop, how key leaders have positively leveraged habits and how changing habits is hard, but within Inez's control.
B00AEFXEN6|5.0|This Movie fill my expectations! it's a Movie that has a Little bit of Everything,both drama,romance and thriller. I give it five stars. i recommend this film to all cineasts  /regards John
B000YMM3CC|3.0|I expected so much more out of this movie.  It had great potential but it didn't live up to it.  Maybe I expected too much from it.
B0053FANQS|5.0|It was very entertaining. I like how the cast keeps coming togther as the franchise advances. It was nice to see most of the  original team again.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|It's one of &#34;the&#34; classics of all times.  Pretty good movie.  Now that I've finally watched it (instead of just clips) I can say it's pretty good.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It absolutely sucks anyway, unless you want HD video with a stupid configuration and tons of ads, don't download this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was awesome the theme of this game every month and there is a store that you can buy stuff .I am 10years old so tack it from me please get this game!
0312853254|1.0|The emperor has no clothes! That's right, this book is horrible.  I finished this book a few weeks ago and the more I thought about it the worse it got.<br /><br />The entire premise is stupid. That thousands of years from now the person that will have the most power in the universe will be the dude that tells everyone the honest truth about someone after they are dead. Dumb.<br /><br />What is more dumb is the inexplicable use of Portuguese. Why the author insists on writing stuff in some other language just to immediately translate it makes no sense. It does nothing for the story.<br /><br />Finally, let's talk about the author's imagined alien world. I won't introduce any spoilers here for those of you who just can't help yourself, but let's just say when you get to the nuts and bolts of how the piggies work I want you to step back and ask yourself if you could have come up with anything more ridiculous. Once you realize that you can't you may find yourself staring in to the void weeping for the hours you wasted reading this sorry excuse for a yarn.<br /><br />Here is the best part. The author explains in the prologue that this was the first book that he then finished after Ender's Game. That explains why it reads like the sophomoric groping on the pages on some teenagers Trapper Keeper.<br /><br />Yes, Ender's Game was fantastic. To those of you who wrote a fantastic review of Speaker for the Dead while still in the glow of Ender's Game you are being intellectually dishonest; may God have mercy on your soul.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Despite abhorring murder, the sympathetic character of Dexter, with his charm and apparently naive innocence endears him to anyone. the character taps into the desire in all of us, I think at least, to see justice done, In this fanatasy world we do not follow by taking to the streets, it is all in our minds and in fiction, I hope.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Good thriller--Affleck loses the thread a couple of times trying to balance the action and emotion parts but it was enjoyable as a whole.  I couldn't figure out why this film came and went so fast, plenty of lesser efforts seemed to generate more buzz. Glad I rented it.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|I sent it back because it does not contain the song of the title by Adele. it was mean not to include it and make it a separate purchase, so you got it back
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I previously purchased this app for my iPhone.  It's my best music app, hands down and I own a few of them.  This app has worked flawlessly on my Kindle, and as of yet have not encountered any problems whatsoever.  This developer cares about this app.  They are continuously upgrading and adding features and content.  Also if one has a problem of any kind they are quick to respond.  This is a great app produced by someone who deeply cares about this application.  If you do encounter a problem, all you have to do is contact them.  They will make it a priority to address the problem at hand..Take Care All....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love hourses thats y it is a really fun game!! it is also addicting when u r boared and have nothing else to do.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the continuation. I'm hooked - there is no way back now. This game just pulls you into it's mysterious world and makes you not want to leave.
B007HJ84WS|3.0|Henry Cavill is great eye candy. The settings, costumes and effects are all spectacular. But the story is muddled. The gods are difficult to identify, but the battles are well-done.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|In the third book of this wonderful series, John Scalzi continues to amaze the reader with political intrigue, betrayal, and the human nature.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|James Franco looks uncomfortable. The women are one-dimensional. But the effects are pretty spectacular. I thought the black and white part was a bit long; felt better when we got into the brilliant technicolor section.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a good one. I keep tipping over, but a good one to fill in short periods of time.
159463176X|5.0|The interplay between the Afghan community in the United States and the relationship of some Afghanis to their home country with all of the complexities that entails makes for a compelling story. Hosseini is an excellent story teller, and I, as probably most western readers, do not know enough about actual life in Afghanistan to know how much is realistic; it does not matter. All of the scenarios are possible in this country that has experienced, and continues to experience, decades of war and a huge disconnect between tribal and urban life.
B00CFA222M|4.0|good movie but a little tame from the previews i expected a more kick ass female role - still it was enjoyable to watch
B008133MDK|5.0|Love this show. Lots of action, intrigue, and laughs. Can't wait for the next season. This contemporary Sherlock is very funny, says exactly what he thinks. He's  too brilliant to think about things like social etiquette or feelings.  John Watson is his moral compass, sidekick, and friend. He puts up with Sherlocks eccentricity. The combination of the two personalities make the perfect sleuthing team.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|An amazing story about determination, love, loyalty, and the price of love.  I enjoyed it and would see it again.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Now they are SPAMMING with totally unwanted ads on my kindle. Dropped this this app immediately. It's not that great. SPAM.
B00CE004XM|5.0|The perfect duo, Beth fantastic voice and Joe's out of this world guitar playing. They are now my most listened to music.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I didn't even have high expectations for this movie. It was worse then I thought it would be. The actors over-acted horribly. It was like watching a Broadway play. Note to actors: you don't need to act so dramatically and have such contorted facial expressions when it is a close up on screen. The plot was useless and boring. This movie has no magic. Except for the last 15 min or so when \\"Oz\\" reveals himself. Other than that, I would avoid this movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very cool game that reminds you to pay attention to all details in order to beat each level and proceed to the next.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Honestly I am kind of upset about how things ended. She made it seem as if the reason Emily was so depressed was going to play out in court or the trial. It was an amazing story though and definitely a page turner. I just wish that key fact played a bigger part.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so fun and super addicting. Great game to pass time. Not to easy not to hard. If u like puzzle games, get this one :)
1449410243|5.0|gave me insights to my furry menace in my house that i believed had saved my life on more than one occasion.
B002APU580|5.0|This is a great family movie. My wife and daughters love it and will watch it over and over again. I recommend it not only for the visual content, but also for the music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not overly difficult just right compared to other games that are similar. I downloaded for free but have paid for this game.
B0091REZMW|3.0|if you like hidden object games this is one of the best. I enjoy it keeps me busy and wanting more. I definately recommend it to everybody like me.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The first third of this movie is very enjoyable with everything you expect from a Die Hard film. But somewhere along the way, the film lost its direction and too much time was spent on the son, almost as if someone thought maybe we can continue the franchise with a younger version of John McClain. Well, to whoever makes those decisions, forget it now. Bruce is Die Hard. The audience doesn't want to see a young wanna be Willis. Willis is Die Hard.<br /><br />And if producers think Willis has aged out of the role, maybe they need to see Red or Red 2. The man is still an action hero. But Hollywood has some weird formula that the 18 to 24 audience won't watch older actors. Maybe they need to adjust their demographics a bit.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Pleads help me. Get thro the 2 level.  To get thro the 1 level  when  you open the coed box look at the pitcher it will say 19 15
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I had hoped that this film would be better considering the cast, but without a good script it just fell apart. A good movie for children over 8 and under 12, and I might be wrong on the older age. Really sad prequel to the Wizard of Oz that might scare younger children and would bore most everyone else. The movie really needed a plot and some idea of what its target audience was.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great game for the kindle fire.  Enjoyed playing a lot.  Have played it three times now, and it's still fun.  Would highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved the game. I wish there were more levels open now that I have passed 10. this could be the next candy crush addiction.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Read about 7/8th of the book.  Stopped reading because they had already reached the end of the HEA in my humble opinion. I will read the last portion later (much much later). The storyline is very predictable though. Thank goodness I didn't have to buy it (free kindle edition).
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Awesome.  Cute game. Nemo is cute.  My reef looks cool. I need more pearls. There needs to be more variety of coral.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you ever need all the Harry Potter movies without the bells and whistles then this is the box set for you.
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|this cd did not meet my expectations compared to the others I have purchased considering the usual upbeat nature of Madeleine's music
B0040I09RM|4.0|Good Cast, Good writing, and plenty of action. Can't wait to continue with Season 2, which is also included with Amazon PRIME.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is nice to be able to sync this with my PC Facebook.  I am able to keep up just about where ever I go.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Didn't buy this but watched it on Netflix Streaming. It was phenomenal and spellbinding! We couldn't stop watching until this was over...13 hours!!! It would be well worth the money to own this DVD because you WILL want to watch it again! Plan to order our own copy.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love this book! After searching for something new to read I fell in love after just a few pages. It has its own sort of rhythm to it with its jumping timeline, but it only adds to the mystery and atmosphere.<br /><br />A must read!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love the TMI Series! Cassandra Clare has created a world that is addictive and characters that are full of depth. I couldn't put this series down, I'm pretty sure I read CIty of Bones, City of Ashes and City of Glass in like a couple days. I highly recommend, this series goes down as one of my ALL time favorites.
B000U6BT40|4.0|Has an everyman sheriff who every week has to solve problems the ultra scientific community of Eureka gets into.The only problem is some characters fill too many roles.
B00122MWBK|5.0|Goo Goo Dolls are one of my favorite bands. would love to get their new cd. Getting the music was fast and very easy. no problem with the down load.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie had no sustains, and nothing to do with the wizard of oz.  They tried to show how the real movie began with the wizard, but they were way off
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book. Read it now. It is clever, well written, and can tell you things about yourself that you didn't know. So read it.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It has a beautiful love story integrated into the Japanese casketing industry. It shows death in a beautiful and dignified way.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Great! Tina Fey should write a million more books. This book made me laugh out loud almost every page. Perfect
B008XG1X18|3.0|I LOVE pinterest but on my kindle it always shuts down! I have to keep uninstalling it and then reinstalling.  My kindle always tells me that the application is not responding and you have to force close. I have nothing against pinterest but this app is not hey good at all.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not particularly gripping and a little all over the place. Good in parts but a bit disjointed. Not a kite runner:-(
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Ten years later and the actors have matured and the acting is fabulous.  A must see before viewing the current &#34;Before Midnight.&#34;
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|It's easy to observe Kanye West's most recent record as \\"difficult\\". Because it is that. But not in the good way.<br />Simply put this just isn't a good record. The music is not particularly interesting or involved. The lyrics are terrible (even on West's scale of already questionable lyrical skills). The packaging is not clever (I seem to recall Mos Def doing this same thing a few years back). West rarely has any flow or cadence. This is the sound of someone misunderstanding minimalism and crossing over into laziness.<br />I have enjoyed West's records in the past, and I hope to enjoy them again. But \\"Yeezus\\" is entirely to lazy and pretentious to devote any significant amount of time with.
B002YDTPHA|2.0|If you liked the first three installments of Final Destination -- which I did -- you may want to end your viewing of the series at that point. The first three had a Scream-like quality. They're horror films with a touch of whimsy and an interesting philosophical conundrum at the center. This film trades in whimsy for gore overload and the philosophical conundrum turns into a series of silver-toned special effects \\"premonitions.\\" I lost interest quickly. I reserve 1 star for films that make me regret I ever heard of them. This doesn't quite sink to that level.
B001NHNG64|1.0|I could understand if Mr. Child were paid by the word. How many different ways can you describe a rock, sand and on and on. Spare me. Please Mr. Child read Stuart Woods or James Patterson and learn
B000YMQI6E|2.0|A lot of reviewers have given this film high marks for style, mood, acting -- and I don't disagree with those comments. But the problem I have with this film is that it is all style and very slim on substance. I have little patience with legal films where the legal system is  misunderstood and made to look like high school. And that's what happens here. After the fourth instance of \\"that would never happen\\" running through my head, I lost interest in the story. When that happens, I give a film 2 stars. And that's what I give this one.
B008EL25LE|1.0|This game makes no sense.  Maybe I am just not a very savvy at this type of game.  Not very entertaining.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I give very few films 5 stars. But when a good film also leaves me thinking a little more deeply about the world, it's more than \\"good.\\" It's art. This film deserved its Academy Award. Well scripted, beautifully shot, telling a complicated story without confusion, and bringing humor to an impossibly dire situation. This is a well-crafted film telling an heroic story -- with heroic characters who couldn't seem more like your neighbors next door. I've seen it three times without any loss in enthusiasm. And will watch it again.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|From the characters to the set design it seems every detail was carefully thought out. Fuller was able to twist the story of Hannibal and draw me back into the old stories I was loved. This is my 2nd time thru the season and it gets better as I go.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris has continued Sookie's story in a believable fashion. She has tied up loose ends and if she decides to contiinue the series there is more to use. I really enjoyed this book.
0345525558|5.0|Was given a copy during surgical recovery. I loved it so much, I have<br />purchased several more to give as gifts.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|I love Ken Follett and try to read all his books I can put my hands on, but this one was too predictable and not that interesting as his other books.
B00174TKGI|4.0|This is one of those movies that I have enjoyed watching more than once.  I love the actors in this one.  I also enjoyed the ending very much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amy and Nick has pass any form of counsel. Simply love the turns and twist that the characters took. In the end they were made for each other.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Another psych movie... with completely inaccurate portrayal of mental conditions. Predictable story line. Too many a Brad Cooper montage. Enough already! Waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game teaches me about horses and how to care for them. The horses are cute and loveable. This is a cool game.
B00821OX98|4.0|If the basic array of characters seem vaguely familiar, it's because they all have their parallel characters in another Spielberg TV series that failed - Terra Nova.  Still, once you get through a few episodes of Falling Skies, you can start to get a feel for the characters and plot lines and begin to care.  It follows a lot of the usual story lines and devices of most post-apocalyptic television series, but like the others, is also mostly about the characters and about a struggle to survive.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|There is a problem where it won't stop loading... I've tried to get around it but won't budge please fix.
1400064287|5.0|Provides six rules for testing out your ideas in an easy to read and understand format. Highly recommended for entrepreneurs with new ideas.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Best game I have found for the kindle. For a tablet game the graphics are great and it has a good storyline
B0091REZMW|1.0|Got this for my kindle a few months ago and everything was good until it had an upgrade then all downhill from there. The app would not open for days and days so got fed up and decide it must have been a glitch and deleted and reinstalled. Again worked great for a while, then once again app failed to open for days and when it did open every time I went  to the garden it would give me an error message and say app has stopped working! Very, very frustrating! Would not recommend this to anyone!
B005544TRQ|4.0|How the characters interact and manipulate each other is the best part.  The stories aren't amazing, and even the legal stuff isn't that accurate (I'm not a lawyer but i know enough about patent law that I know they did an amateurish job on that story).  I've only watched a couple episodes and the dynamics may falter...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game was fun to figure out all of the puzzles. Fun game to play with the kids. Wish there were more levels.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Best invention ever. I am never without a book. It is a shame that you can not make your phone a paper white page to do away with glare.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Found by accident and have not stopped playing since. Not that difficult but you need to think. Makes you sit back and say duhh.......
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this was the best season so far, I have watched them all several times and will continue to do so. I see new things hidden all the time. Keep up the good work! Looking forward to the next season!
B00136JS12|4.0|I held off buying this album for years because I didn't want to pay a lot for it. The download price was good to me, and I have enjoyed listening to it after all these years.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|Amazing how the stories and questions really did relate to my personality and the job I do on a daily basis!
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|I just saw this in the theater today with hubby & friends.  We went in with low expectations after seeing the trailers, but we were willing to give it a shot based on how much we love the tv show.  It was better than we expected!  Not super awesome, not my favorite movie, but it was enjoyable.<br /><br />It keeps the same spark of humor that the tv show has.  Twilight's reaction to being human & having to learn how to move and interact with people was hilarious.  Spike being a dog was fine, it was handled well.  The other 5 of the main 6 characters had been friends but broken apart after Sunset Shimmer's meddling.  They were able to talk about their misunderstandings, realize that they'd all been duped, and mend their friendships.<br /><br />The stereotypical \\"become popular to win the princess contest\\" plot felt fresh.  It wasn't the same old stale high school drama.  And although they did introduce awareness of dating (Flash Sentry asks Twilight to the dance, and he is Sunset Shimmer's ex-boyfriend) it was a fresh twist of the stereotype because Twilight has better things to worry about.  So much so that she pretty much brushed him off and the poor guy had to ask her three times.<br /><br />The plot line to get her crown felt rushed to me.  She had three days to get the crown, but really only about one day to win over the entire school to vote for her.  Though other people said the pacing felt fine to them.  So maybe it's just me.<br /><br />I don't usually pay a whole lot of attention to the songs but the opening music was AWESOME.  It's a revamped, techno remix kind of deal with lots of energy.  I'd be totally ok with them using that for the season 4 opening music if they wanted to.<br /><br />The only major drawback for me was the fight at the end.  As another reviewer mentioned, Sunset Shimmer turns into this winged demon thing when she puts on Twilight's crown.  Then she puts the high schoolers under a mind control spell and wants to go take over Equestria.It was jarring and took me out of the experience.  It wasn't really scary, just stupid.  It doesn't last very long though because when she tries to attack Twilight & Co. with the magic, it doesn't work because the magic is really Twilight's.  Twilight & Co. save the day, have a party, and she goes home.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this movie to Pony fans.  It has it's shark-jumping moments but overall it's pretty true to the heart of the tv series.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I laughed so hard and those two have great chemistry on set..one that I would watch again. Great love story also.
0143122916|4.0|GReat book but seem to go very sour at the mind point took a while to finish the whole book
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Satisfying conclusion.  Good character development, what you expected for the heroes and villains.  Stunning locations and details in filming.  Glad I watched it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I liked the movie watched it twice.  As a great fan of the Wizard of Oz.  This movie was able to measure up to the great original Oz movie.  Could have used a bit more Character  building on the relationship between the witches.  I would watch the movie again and enjoy it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Sorry, I wrote the wrong review for part two.  This was a good intro to the end of the series.  The goblin parts were very good.  Wish the minor characters got better development.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show pulls you in ad keeps you invested in the story and characters.  Can't wait for the next season to start in July!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I had used emulators including some very expensive cards that would create a serial port interface that had adjustable UART protocols. I was stuck in a bind of either using legacy computers with Dos or Win 95 based applications to program older and even newer radios. With most computers not even having a hint of UART or a serial port, things like this have allowed me to use newer computers but still program radios, older computer components, and other needs. I replaced an older adapter and when I upgraded to Windows 8, I was up a creek. Now with this adapter, I am not having problems.
B0096MM9GG|3.0|Have gotten a little old to play this game on small devices but still feel this was a decent carryover from the one I spent days on at my PC years ago. Certainly worth the price.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show.  With excellent writing, perfect casting, terrific acting, and a beautiful setting, what's not to like?
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Although I even like modern versions of the great sleuth (especially the PBS series) how can you turn down this collection as an e-book for 99 cents! Have found ones I never read and love re-reading the ones I have read. What more can I say?
B002XXPNXG|2.0|80 minutes of philasophical discussion between two people unhappy with life.  What's the point?  Why is this series getting so much publicity?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm a freshman in high school and this book made me realize that there are other people out there just like me. I highly recommend you read this book, it is the best book I have ever read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game is fun and presents a bit of a challenge. Well put together and makes you think. Only problem is that there aren't enough levels, I finished the hole game in a matter of hours. But over all its a good game
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|FUN TO PLAY, I HAVE NO OTHER WORDS TO SAY ABOUT THIS GAME. ONLY NEGATIVE, MUSIC IS TOO LOUD. THANKS
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a true challenge. Test your sleuthing skills and play today!  I can't wait for more levels to be available!!
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Very good movie... Makes you think... Usual detective movie. If you want to be into a deep movie like this one please watch. Great for a bored night.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Interesting adaptation of original children's story. This movie is still a fairy tale but with some comedy as a twist. Not a great movie but a nice \\"escape\\" movie. I enjoyed it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun cool amazing kind of good for horse lovers nice to play when bored I think people<br /><br />would like. It if they got it
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Interesting plot change on the original Wizard of Oz movie. I enjoyed this movie, but it's not a great movie like the original version. Some movies just don't need to be remade as they have no hope of being better than the original.
0375823107|5.0|This is classic Dr. Seuss, and a great story for anyone who is graduating or moving to a next phase of their lives. No one ever gets too old for Dr. Seuss, so it's a terrific story for a graduate of kindergarten or a graduate of Ph.D., in my humble opinion.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Still very exciting but perhaps not as intense as earlier movies in this franchise.  Characters and acting as great as always, but it's not quite as good as earlier Die Hard films.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game for the kids & family. Very colorful and addicting. Fun for all. I like that there is interactive ideas on what to do.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game to get the mind thinking. Wish it gave hints and saved progress if in the middle of a room.
B007ZTN07O|5.0|Great game but it needs a serious update It be nice if it had all the characters and team endings
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|SO DISAPPOINTED!! I have to end this story on my own because I will not buy any more Crossfire books. Book 2 delved into Eva's past and I assumed (wrongly) that book 3 was going to do the same with Gideon's: his demon's, mother, Christopher, the Doctor. None of these story lines went anywhere. Instead Ms. Day tried to introduce many new plots that I didn't care about and didn't want to start. The best advise I've received from the other reviews is how to return the book and that's what I'm going to do now.<br /><br />Here's how I returned my kindle version: 1-866-216-1072. They were very accommodating. Return your book today, stop this gouging of consumers!
B0094M2ITG|5.0|I watched this again here recently after seeing it several years ago.  Great actors and a great plot.  Will probably watch it again in a couple of more years.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|love it: simple plus great price; cannot go wrong with this little tool.  would buy again no problems you will love it
B002QZ399G|5.0|This has so many side plots it is hard to follow at times.  The quality of actors that are in this movie more than make up for it though.  Not a block buster.  But, certainly worth watching.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I love fps games, and this game is great to be played in a Kindle. Great playability. Great work and well done.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|Insightful, real, romantic, thought provoking, I could go on forever with adjectives.  A must see movie with its companion film Before Sunrise.  You will love it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A lot of fun,  helped grandkids find the hidden objects.  They truly enjoyed the adventure. Looking forward to the sequel.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Well written and acted.  The dialogue is tremendous. It is nice to see a movie with real dialogue that draws you into it because it is so relatable.
B005LAIII0|5.0|My husband and I loved the movie! It has a beautiful, thought-provoking and emotion storyline, filled with these metaphorical characters, and scenes saturated in the most beautiful color you have every seen on blu-ray. I highly recommend buying this movie on blu-ray.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i think i'm addicted... this game is great. i can't stop playing it. i especially like how large the sea is, and how many things are out to kill you.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|We just finished Order of the Phoenix last night after doing a two-day HP marathon, and will probably finish the last three films tonight. We have been impressed with the packaging, quality of picture, and color that comes through. Personally, I don't think the films hold a candle to the books, but the picture sure looks impressive on Blu-Ray. If you like the films, we would highly recommend buying this package.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The fault in our stars is tremendously bold and honest. One I will recommend to many different audiences. You can't get through without a good sob or two.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie got this story so right! From the scenes in the consulate, to the political unrest, you feel like you are in Tehran during the revolution. Even though I knew how the story ended before I ever watched the film, it still makes my heart pound with the intensity of the scenes, the direction, and the music. If you haven't seen it yet, or if you enjoyed it in theaters, but didn't buy it yet, definitely splurge and get the bluray version.
1400049628|5.0|Please read some of the other reviews for a more through description of the Zombie Survival guide. I was hesitant to write a review on a book that has been reviewed over 1000 times - I am certain I cannot be more eloquent or complete than many of the other reviews - but this is such an excellent work I had to answer some of the 1-star reviews. If you notice - most of the poor reviews cited the lack of a story line and the dryness of the material. Those reviews generally are short. They completely miss the point - just like the 3-D paintings that were the rage some years ago, either you saw a cool visual effect or you saw a crappy painting.<br /><br />The detail of the information, and the dryness with which it is presented is designed (besides the obvious sarcasm) to allow you use your imagination to fill your life into the situation being described. As he states the usefulness of certain weapons, I thought of what we had in our home and how it would rate given the requirements he states. A particular image from my imagination is the description of home types and how to defend them. Initially I believed that our two story home with no basement would be disadvantageous for us during a zombie attack, however now I know that two story homes are easily defensible by destroying the staircase and moving all necessary supplies upstairs. I have two six-foot ladders, so I could keep one low and one high without worrying about zombies figuring out how to use them to get at my family. This home is more easily defended than one with a basement, which Brooks describes as a zombie feeding hole. I can picture myself using my sledgehammer and Ryobi sawzall to demolish my staircase. I think I need a better sawzall.<br /><br />If you have an imagination, as the author drones on in his monotone voice - your mind should fill each scenario with what you think your methods, materials, decisions and outcomes could be given your specific situation. I have the audio-book version which really aids in this, as my mind is freed from reading and can just produce a custom movie for viewing. Unlike World War Z, which is a zombie story about an outbreak involving other people, this Zombie Survival Guide is about an outbreak involving YOU, if you can see it in 3-D. Otherwise, it will be just as the 1 Star reviews say it is, a boring and drab book with no story line.
0871403633|5.0|One of the best books I ever read. The concept of humanity driven by altruism is phenomenal. A must read.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was a good book but it seemed really rushed. All of the loose ends were tied up...except, I wanted to know what happened to Bubba.
B008Y73940|4.0|Mathew  mcConnehey seldom does serious movies but when he does, he shines as the good actor he really is. Watch \\"A Time To Kill\\" I think it was his first serious movie and he is excellent. His girlie fluff movies are usually from a formula that has been done over and over. He needs to do more real acting jobs so his talent shows
1781162646|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for as long as he has been publishing his stories.  Some were OK but most were great stories.  This one is a great quick read and a very good story.  I really enjoyed it and have been recommending it to my friends and family.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a game that is easy to learn but very difficult to master.  Fun game play with challenge that grows as you become more proficient.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Is useful for minecraft world locating. Is a bit tricky to use. Sorry I need to use up eight more words.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|It was an interesting read but after about 4 chapters it became very predictable... it was just a case of how the villian was going to die.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The scenes are very detailed and you find yourself getting involved with the family in trying to locate her son! The paintings are beautiful and the twists and turns keep you wanting to play the game.  This game is well worth getting and replaying. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and the graphics are extremely clear, easy to locate items needed to complete tasks. You won't finish this game in one sitting-there is so much to look at, you will want to take your time to look at each of the scenes before going on.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I love this game - just enough hidden objects, love that you have to go back and forth in the scenes to hunt for items and put them where they belong to keep the story line going.  It is cleverly put together - now the however part, I need help on getting past the painting part, I found the paint brush, returned to the painting and inserted the brush on the canvas, then the game freezes. I have to close the game and can only re-enter it the next day. The help monkey always leads me to that point, so I am stuck in the game also.  It does not say I need to purchase any thing to finish the game, as I would gladly do so. The graphics are great, as the story line. If anyone can give me advice, I would appreciate it. I would love to finish the game, perhaps I need to start from the beginning?
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I want to be a photographer so I use this app a lot... and there are no problems at all... my mom loves all the pictures I send from this app... :) hope you like it.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I really enjoy the game. The only problem I see is that it's easy to give the other player a point. My son beat me once because I gave him all his points by hitting them in. Really fun game overall.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A great way to spend your time. Clues are amazingly hidden and keeps you in suspends on where the next one is hidden. Cannot wait for more rooms to explore.
B00005K9LN|5.0|I had originally bought this album, on vinyl, back in July 1980. Earlier this month, I decided to buy the remastered CD version from Amazon. Just by listening to this album, it feels as though I am reliving the Summer of 1980, all over again. At least IN MEMORY, I'm living in 1980 & this album brings back tons of happy memories for me. I had really hit the jack pot w/ THIS album, just like I did w/ \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\".  They are both PERFECT albums, in my honest opinion. I'd like to offer my review on \\"British Steel\\" now:<br /><br />1.  \\"Rapid Fire\\"...I was always surprised that this song wasn't titled as \\"Pounding The World Like A Battering Ram\\", instead of the title of \\"Rapid Fire\\", which is NEVER mentioned throughout the song @ all.  Otherwise, this is one great song & I've always enjoyed this.<br /><br />2.  \\"Metal Gods\\"...I've always loved this song, too. The only complaint, that I have about this song, is the long instrumental ending. I wish that they could have sung, just the words, \\"Metal Gods\\" for about 3 or 4 more times, before the song ends.<br /><br />3.  \\"Breaking The Law\\"...I still wish that this was the OPENING cut on my CD, like it was on my record.  This song rec'd some radio airplay in the Fall of 1980. I've always loved this song, very much.<br /><br />4.  \\"Grinder\\"...In 1980, I NEVER noticed how much this song reminds me of AC/DC's kind of song. Now in June of 2013, I really can spot the musical resemblance to AC/DC.  I have always got a big kick out of this song...it's really good.<br /><br />5.  \\"United\\"...This song is just plain fantastic, in my opinion. I have always loved this song w/ such nice lyrics.<br /><br />6.  \\"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\\"...As I had just mentioned on \\"Grinder\\", THIS song ALSO bears a resemblance to AC/DC's music again. It really puts me in mind of \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", from AC/DC's \\"Back In Black\\" album, ALSO from 1980. This song is EXCELLENT in every way possible.  It also has one hell of a rebellious attitude towards life. And I just love this song, very much.<br /><br />7.  \\"Living After Midnight\\"...This song has the words PARTY TIME written all over it. It is one hell of a fun & uplifting song.  And it has a great beat, too. This was the hit, on the radio, in the Summer of 1980.<br /><br />8.  \\"The Rage\\"...This song has always been pretty good. I like this.<br /><br />9.  \\"Steeler\\"...Another song where the TITLE is never mentioned, either.  It's pretty good, though.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br /><br />10. \\"Red White & Blue\\"...I love this song, very much.  For some oddball reason, this song could remind me of \\"United\\", somewhat, in it's meaning.<br /><br />11. \\"Grinder\\"...Recorded live In Concert.<br /><br />This album is STILL great, in my honest opinion. It will always be HIGHLY recommended. I keep forgetting to mention, that it's really great to get the LYRICS w/ ALL of my Judas Priest CD's.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I wanted to continue reading to find out what happened next! I learned some things about the war that were very interesting. I loved the way the author got you interested in the different characters...
B0000630BT|4.0|This 1990 album by Judas Priest began the NINETIES decade w/ this \\"Painkiller\\" album. It's time for me to review this CD as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Painkiller\\"...One hell of a powerful TITLE track & it's pretty good.<br /><br />2.  \\"Hell Patrol\\"...I like this song, very much. It's decent, in my opinion.<br /><br />3.  \\"All Guns Blazing\\"...This song is only a passable song, it's NOT one of my favorites.<br /><br />4.  \\"Leather Rebel\\"...I like this song, quite well.  It's pretty good.<br /><br />5.  \\"Metal Meltdown\\"...This song isn't too bad.<br /><br />6.  \\"Night Crawler\\"...This song is pretty decent.  I love the scary voices in the middle of the song. Ozzy Osbourne could also be very good, on this song. It also seems like HIS kind of song material. Judas Priest does this song just right & just perfect.<br /><br />7.  \\"Between The Hammer & The Anvil\\"...This song isn't too bad @ all.<br /><br />8.  \\"A Touch Of Evil\\"...I actually think that this song is the VERY BEST on this entire album.  It is also my TOP favorite, incl., here. I esp. love the scary bells on the intro & in the middle of this song.<br /><br />9.  \\"Battle Hymn\\"...A short instrumental, not even ONE minute long.<br /><br />10.  \\"One Shot At Glory\\"...This is only passable to me & NOT a favorite of mine. It's the album's LONGEST song.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br /><br />11. \\"Living Bad Dreams\\"...This song is only okay.<br /><br />12. \\"Leather Rebel\\"...(Live In Concert). I like this live version just much as the studio version.<br /><br />This 1990 album is most definitely recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 10 year old loves this game.  She has several games on her Kindle Fire.  This one is here favorite.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Awesome, funny, serious way to look at the social cast system in America.  Highly recommend!  Totally entertaining!  Rent it, buy it, see it.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|I had no idea what this movie was about and even once it started I didn't know exactly where the film was headed, but I ended up completely surprised and fascinated. Unexpected twists and turns keep you guessing the entire time. I would recommend watching.
B006CHML4I|1.0|You'd think that since Seiko has been making watches since 1924, they'd make watches that keeps time accurately.  This watch runs fast, about 2 minutes for every 24 hours, which is pathetic.  I have really cheap watches that keep time more accurately.  Also, the watch powers itself from the movements of your wrist, which is fine if you wear the watch everyday.  But if you don't wear the watch for a few days, it stops.  That is a design feature (no replaceable long term battery), which I don't really care for, but others may like.  The strap is cloth and comfortable.  However, the strap holders are metal (probably brushed aluminium), which tend to scrap and scratch desktops and my laptop.<br /><br />But hey, it looks great.  One star for that.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|This has some of the most iconic jazz standards ever recorded performed by the original artist. What's not to love.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|Have love the Sookie series and I was just so disappointed with this one.  Was it written to just finish the series quickly, seems so.  None of the questions or possible outcomes we were given hints on in previous books were in this one.  Story just ended, entirely unsatisfactory.  Your left feeling, so why did we go on this journey with Sookie over so many books, to end in such a mundane and boring way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game keeps you thinking about your next move and the significance of all of the codes and combinations you discover. A real pleasure!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|Ever since I upgraded, i've lost the ability to use dropbox within the app. Before i could link my dropbox account and it would access it. Now, when ever i try to login it goes back to the login window and refuses to go any further. I've tried contacting support but they are not contacting me back.<br /><br />Overall it's still good system, but i'm very upset i've lost this option and with no help.<br /><br />Horrible support, won't even reply back to my emails (And yes, i've checked my spam filter)<br /><br />Edit: 12/10/13<br /><br />Well, they finally updated and, yeah they've made things worse. To fix their dropbox issue ... they've removed it completely. It's no longer an option. As well, the auto form filling PDF's i used to love using on this no longer work. This has really made this purchase a regret i simply can not recommend this app.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love it so much I bought the audio version for my mother who is blind and she bought the book for my aunt.  I have told everyone about it.  Two of my older sister's have read it already and several more are getting ready to!
B000RO9VJK|5.0|I didn't start my business because I love business... this book addresses how to go about doing what you love without just creating a job for yourself.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I wasn't sure what to do at first but once I figured it out I am really enjoying it. It keeps me interested and the clues are good when I need one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a fun game that makes you think.  Not super difficult so it is good for most ages.
B0012TWRAO|3.0|I'm still experimenting with where and how to mount it. i had it on my old motorized wheelchair, and the cup holder kept getting caught-up in the wheel.  On my new wheelchair, the drink holder (attached to the ball mount) got ripped off, while backing my wheelchair into the car.  I'm waiting for new ELR (Elevating Leg Rest) mounts before I remount this item on my new chair again
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great escape...not too hard...not too easy. Looking forward to seeing more apps just looks it. Thanks for the fun<br />.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|\\"The Avengers\\" is the latest in a string of awfully pathetic movies recently released (the other awfully pathetic movies are Skyfall and The Dark knight rises). \\"The Avengers\\" was put together by a couple movie studios to garner as much publicity and revenue as possible, and simultaneously and ironically succeeded in creating one of the worst superhero movies ever. Why, you ask? Here's why. \\"The Avengers\\" lacked a good story. We've already seen Loki and the villains that inhabit his world in the movie \\"Thor\\", and they were not menacing at all (the IRS is more evil than Loki). Second, this movie lacked any type of character development (there was actual character development in the Iron Man movies, The Hulk movies, Batman Begins, X-Men: First Class, and Man of Steel). Third, this movie lacked the depth and mercurial intelligence exhibited in the Iron Man movies. Fourth, the plot of this movie was predictable (as evidenced in the opening scenes and in Loki's flashback), so we already knew what was going to happen but we were forced to sit through an hour or so of nonsense and filler before Loki's \\"army\\" attacked.<br /><br />The only good elements and the reasons why \\"The Avengers\\" 2 stars out of 5 is a condign rating is because the fight scenes between Thor and The Hulk and Iron Man was something we hadn't seen before in superhero movies (it turned out to be a stalemate and seeing The Hulk trying to pick up Thor's hammer was interesting and funny at the same time, and seeing Thor's hammer increase the power of Iron Man's suit was interesting and funny as well), and Iron Man's usual sarcastic, intellectual charm was entertaining to watch and the reason why the Iron Man movies were so successful.<br /><br />Bottom line: don't waste your money and time watching \\"The Avengers\\".
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|there were parts that were just too slow or didn't seem very real. It needed less description and more dialogue.
B0047MZUUM|5.0|As expected and more ! when i recieved it everything was in an excellent condition . The packaging was great and everything i read about the product review was 100 %true
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Edge of the seat viewing. I couldn't stop watching the episodes. I've seen it twice through already. I am preparing to view it again!
B008X6N1OA|5.0|As expected and more ! when i recieved it everything was in an excellent condition . The packaging was great and everything i read about the product review was 100 %true
B008FQ1O1K|2.0|not anywhere near as good as his other books, i'd give this one a miss, boring and slow moving, .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love how the levels get progressively harder. Very interesting problems to solve. Makes the game more challenging. Good brain exercise.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is a long awaited DVD that all who love the Eagles would enjoy.  It goes into the background of the group and also shows great footage of their performances.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm not sure who enjoyed it more me the kids or the wife after were done playing it again. I look forward to the sequel and other G5 games
B008QMMEOE|3.0|This is am awesome app that my 2.5 year old loves to play and can complete the puzzles on his own...until the app crashes...a lot ( at least on the nabi jr. Device)
B00936A0RU|1.0|The movie could have been good. Unfortunately it was very violent, very graphic and very bloody. I don't need to see and hear gory details like that, over and over again, right in your face. I also did not understand most of the actors. &#34;Forrest&#34; for example mumbled continuously, I was close to turning on subtitles for this guy. The story was good but less violence would have been better.
B008NMT684|3.0|This is am awesome app that my 2.5 year old loves to play and can complete the puzzles on his own...until the app crashes...a lot ( at least on the nabi jr. Device)<br /><br />Great app, poor performance on device
B003IEJZUG|5.0|The story was very entertaining.  I could have done without some of the character's lists, but it came off as a personality quirk. Illustrations were gorgeous.  They really enhanced the story.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This movie was so cute, adding it to my list of my favorite movies! It was easy to put in the code and watch it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game! Each floor as well as level become increasing more challenging.just when you think you find a pattern to the puzzle its changes up.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|A really great season. I enjoyed it. However it did seem to be missing some scenes. Also it paused a bit even when I had a great signal. I still loved it great watch
B00B4804KS|3.0|Bought this because of all the rave reviews on here, and watched it on my new 70&#34; Sony 3D TV but wasn't as impressed as others on Amazon. Yes, it's in 3D but I didn't see anything spectacular or extraordinary with the 3D effects. In fact, some of the 3D separation of the elements looked a bit contrived and too jarringly extreme.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was just as good as the first in the series! Hard to put it down! I hope there is a way for her to write #4!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The whole series is captivating!  We couldn't wait to watch the next episode so many times we watched 3 or 4 in one sitting!  Without spoiling the ending I'll just say I'm not exactly pleased with how it ended...
B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators, it's by John Grisham - He never disappoints, I have not found a JG book I didn't like!!!<br />'Nuff said!!!!
B00985E3UG|4.0|I loved this book. It is informative without the chemical, technical language that could turn off a reader.  Maybe not for the reader who is new to the field of nutrition or behavioral economics, but if you read Pollan or Nestle, you'll find a good read here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Let the fun begin! What a good trilogy, loved all three of them. Who doesn't love 'Christian Grey'??? I want MORE!!
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|I love that he works with so many different artists to make his music diverse. The entire CD is fantastic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had to get the first in the trilogy to see what the fuss was all about. I found out, and ended up with ALL THREE!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a really fun and challenging game,  it really kept my mind active at work. I cant wait for more lvls
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow what a fun game. Very entertaining,  not to hard yet not easy. Graphics are good. Cant wait for new rooms.
B002NUULNG|4.0|Technical &#34;improvements&#34; aside, this is a movie you must own.  If you are a purist, or prefer the original version, get that one.
B0095P31L6|3.0|I usually like the kids animated movies once in a while but this one didn't really do anything for me.
B00B04NJLW|5.0|Most directors here are really good but most of their films are foreign movies.  This is a good way of seeing their potential and hunt down their previous work.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazing hours upon days,upon weeks;monthsandyears of demanding exhausting training with tremendously rewarding results. Thanks to all who give of themselves for us!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|this is a interesting story and I like how this doctor (non-believer) of near death experiences comes around after his own occurance.  However, probably because of his schooling his highly technical descriptions of the brain functions makes a lay person want to lay this book down and give up--but keep going it is worth it
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This film is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever watched.  Great filming and an even better story.  You don't want to miss this.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|This is an all time classic! I enjoyed it more now than the first time I saw it! I highly recommend this one for a nice night of classic!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Fantastic story from the past right up to the present. You can feel the family history as it weaves from the beginning.
B000I186FW|5.0|...Best movie i ever watched,kept me captured every minute...I would reccomend it to everyone...So,watch it today and u'll love it...
B00005NQCB|4.0|I love Icehouse. This is my second album that I own of theirs. Both albums have been great and I listen to them constantly.
B00C061I3K|5.0|It is Daft Punk and I love it.<br />One of the greatest come backs in their history.<br /><br />Enjoy it to the fullest.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I was blown away by all the action and the special effects. Hands down better than the Stallone version from the 90's. I rarely ever buy a movie on dvd especially after seeing it in the theater. This movie was worth buying on dvd and enjoying it at home again.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This app is truly my favorite. All of the elements are great! But I wish that the game goes on longer.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|just like any other overly priced lego set.  Son loves them though, so its a good product.  Lots of small pieces.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is my first Amazon Prime streaming video experience.  I loved this pilot and was not happy when I realized that only the pilot episode is free.  Since I am on fixed income I will have to wait until next month to even think about purchasing further episodes, but this series is worth waiting for.  I just finished watching Dexter and Prison Break, so it takes an exceptionally intricate plot to keep my attention anymore.  I found what I was looking for in Suits, can hardly wait to see the rest of it.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|So cute.  You'll fall in love with little Boo.  It's a movie that is as enjoyable for kids as well as adults.  It's a keeper.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderful book keeps your attention,does not ramble on or get boring,easy read,helps you realize that time is a gift that should be cherished
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's one of the old fashioned feel good type of a movie with the familiar Harrison Ford type of humor.  A must see!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Worst COMPLAINT: 300 wood to make one needle? Are you people out of your minds? The costs to make some products are way too high. I can tell you flat out that the sick pioneer in my town is being left to die. He wants a splint and 2 needles, and the last lady I wasted all those resources on gave me such a pitiful &quot;reward&quot; that I decided anyone wanting needles can add to my lovely graveyard.<br /><br />Secondary complaint: Every time I try to build a community building it says that I need &quot;x number of residents&quot;. Pardon me, idiots. I have 5 times that population. Oh, you mean that I need that many HOUSES? Well why don't you say that instead of ticking me off constantly? So sick of cramming more houses in just to build a community building I was asked to build.<br /><br />On the plus side, there are a range of things to do, though adding neighbors is nearly impossible for me. Lots of things to craft if you have the ingredients, animals to hunt down, prospecting and fishing. Nice way to kill time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful story, great new author.  Love the story line and this authors writing style....flows beautifully.  Makes it so much more enjoyable.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|Haunting song once in a lifetime. Can't get it out of my head. (Talking Heads get it.) Worth the money.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I like. James Lee Burke, he writes of things that I am familiar with.  I have been to many of the places and it makes me recall them.  Besides I like the type of characters he uses.  A good read.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|John le Carre hits the spot again (how old is he now?) with a beautifully orchestrated and devious tale.  Initially, the ending upset me; but sometime later, I can see why he left the sory as he did.  The book is oddly appropriate for this time, with Edward Snowden on the run.  I can only hope for more books from le Carre.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I did not expect to like it, but found myself intrigued by every character and liked most of them.  I enjoyed the rambling historical facts interspersed with absurd macabre humour.  And anyone who can introduce an elephant into the mix in a swedish scenario is to be admired
B00C7BZYF6|4.0|Starring Katie Chang, Israel Broussard, Emma Watson, Taissa Farminga, Leslie Mann and Claire Julien<br /><br />THE BLING RING is best looked at as a crime satire. Some may think this film can't decide what it wants to be, which I can understand, however I don't think it takes any of the quality away. If anything, the pacing can be awkward. There are some great comedic parts, such as Rebecca (Chang) trying to steal Paris Hilton's dog, breaking and entering with no qualms, and Emma Watson's perfect portrayal or Alexis Neiers.<br /><br />As a cautionary tale, it does show that teens are getting better at being 'out of control'. Prescription drugs are the go-to drugs for many, there is a lot of cocaine use throughout the film. Clearly these teens are lost, amoral, vapin, vain and selfish. I think that Coppola allows us to see who they really are; yes they're not the most likable clique of teens, but most can identify with wanting to be 'a part of the Hollywood lifestyle'.<br /><br />Playing almost as a docudrama, the film is visceral and has an art-house feel to it. It was filmed flawlessly. Yeah you might hate Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and these kids but why can't we accept them for who they are? Especially if they have no apologies like Rachel Lee (Katie Chang's character) and take what they want without hesitation.<br /><br />If only they focused this much on their grades... right?<br /><br />Recommended age: 15+ frequent coarse language, mature subject matter, drug and alcohol use and mature themes involving crime.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent story line  superb acting. Anxious for the continued saga. Characters well developed..surprise suspense murder love. Dowton Abby has it all
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This story is very well written and not what I expected at all. It reads like an actual historical account and at some points of this book, you tend to forget that it's fiction. Of you are expecting it to be like the newly released Brad Pitt movie , it is absolutely not. This book is made up of many stories that weave together the history of the Zombie War.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is entertained by zombie stories but if you are interested in suspenseful stories I would recommend this to you too.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I love Christmas!!! And I am a big fan of the \\"traditional animated\\" Christmas films... But when I saw Arthur Christmas it won my heart over..... The updated animated Christmas movie is a film the whole family will enjoy!!
B008JFUPK8|1.0|What a shame such a great story turned into something so boring, tedious and annoying! Unfortunately for the Man of Steel, every story has a beginning, middle and end. Something the average person learns when they are in kindergarten or First Grade! All three parts of a story need to be done well or else it's no fun! A great beginning does not make-up for a mediocre middle or a disastrous ending!<br /><br />The Man of Steel starts with a fantastic back story. For the very first time we really get to observe Krypton in all it's technological glory! Only to see the story slowly degenerate into camp with cardboard characters from the military that you could find in any comic books story. And, then like a car with a stuck accelerator, the story rapidly turns into another brainless war porn and 9/11-type flick (Chicago gets trashed instead of New York.  When your story is so rotten you distract your audience by wrecking another major city! Wow! That was imaginative!)<br /><br />Man Of Steel is also the ultimate product placement film. In fact, you could randomly choose a half-dozen movies that have been shown on the big screen this past year - and I'll bet you the Man of Steel has more product placement then all of them COMBINED! It was so obnoxious it was distracting! In the 45 years of watching movies I can only think of a handful of times that product placement has been this aggressive!! It's also symptomatic of an incredibly weak story!<br /><br />The Man of Steel is so bad I was dying to walk out; but, I went to see the film with a friend so I felt obligated to stay. At least I had the sense to close my eyes and tune-out the last half hour of explosions, grunting and screaming in order to put my meditation skills to the test! I'm happy to report that even though I was totally sober I was able to completely tune-out the last 30 minutes of the Man of Steel and I could care less about what happened to any of the story's characters!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:0786419040 Product Placement in Hollywood Films: A History]] and [[ASIN:1479319880 So Bad, It's Good: More Than 50 Great Films for Your Bad Movie Night]] P.S.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I was mesmerized by this book. Definitely not what I was expecting. I might give away too many details if I continue....but if you're thinking about reading it...do it!
B000W8HC8I|3.0|Having had a personal and extremely disappointing connection with Mr. Belfort I can only say that he is what he purports to be in the book. There is no great redemption.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This was a pretty good book all in all...  it had a very surprising ending.... Jodi keeps you guessing right up until the end...
B009PK9SB8|5.0|It was really very difficult to take shots with go-pro camera especially when you fix camera on a pike or on helmet but with that LCD screen the job now is so easy.<br />Also the feature of seeing and delete the photo and video at the same time was so helpful, before was so difficult because you have to transfer the photo to your laptop or PC to save or delete the picture you don't need.<br />I recommend all go-pro user to pay the LCD touch
B00CATSONE|3.0|If you want to read and learn all about Tesla, this really isn't the forum.  This \\"book\\" briefly describes his time with (and against) Edison, Westinghouse and Morgan.<br /><br />Nearly 20% of the story had unfolded in the first chapter before even a mention of his name.  One might think this was written about imagination only and not that of Tesla.  Had it not been so short, and short it was, I likely would have given up before the end of the first segment.<br /><br />If all you wish is a brief overview of his patents and run ins, this will satisfy you.  However, if you want to know what made the man tick, you ought to look elsewhere.
B00D8RYV52|3.0|my 5 year old daughter and 4 year old niece love this game. I, on the other hand think that this newest game needs a little work on the activities and more choices on decals and paint, etc. its a work in progress! update soon please :)

0765325950|5.0|I was a little surprised how big this book is. A pleasant one.Brandon Sanderson has managed to fullfill my expectation. Finally I have complete Wheel of Time in my hands.

3836538725|5.0|This is a large book, a great book, an important book, a beautiful book. Its avowed purpose is to instill a love of our planet through the medium of magnificent black and white photographs of the world's untamed places, animals, and people, as they were or may have been in the time before history. The artist, Sebastiao Salgado, is a master photographer--a master landscape photographer, a master nature photographer, a master people photographer, and a master aerial photographer. Each of the hundreds of photographs magnificently printed in this book is a masterpiece, even those few printed in smaller than full-page format. There isn't a weak image in the lot. The pictures of unfamiliar places, animals, and people are no less than awe-inspiring. The pictures of more familiar places and animals, such as Bryce Canyon and Monument Valley, and lions, penguins and apes, stand favorable comparison with the very best black and white photographs of the same subjects by other master photographers.<br /><br />The book's layout gives respectful white space to the images, and while there are some larger images that span double-page spreads, I somehow didn't find this as annoying as I often do.<br /><br />This book is also a great bargain. Go buy it!<br /><br />As to its purpose, the book shows us the beauty of a fragile world we humans are on a fast track to destroying, but don't expect it to raise your commitment to alleviating global warming, our world's greatest existential peril. That's too much to expect of any book of photographs in this day and age of media saturation. Hopefully, some of the book's proceeds will help Salgado and his wife in their work of restoring a small piece of the Brazilian rain forest.
B0044WUQ3G|2.0|I had to laugh because it's suppose to be so cold that they are freezing but not once could you see their breath so you know it wasn't cold. The fake frostbite was just plain fake looking as well as the fake snow. I found myself fast forwarding just to see how it ended. So unless you can see it for free I wouldn't spend any money on it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What an amazing story.<br />Riveting.<br />A lot of names to keep track of.  About five books woven into one.  Quite emotional, very sobering.  Wonderful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun and entertaining.  this game puts your brain to the test.  so much more than those games that continuely repeats itself.  try this game your enjoy the challenge.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Again, Hosseini gives the reader a gem of a story, with rich characterizations and insights into Afghanistan's troubled history.  With the central theme of loss and eventual reunion, the bittersweet conclusion will long remain in the reader's mind
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|Works great, well polished, as good a strategy game as there is. I only wish I was better at strategically playing.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|I loved The 100 Year Old Man. The author carefully wove his story onto the major historical events of the 20th century. I actually read it twice to look for the details i had missed the first time. Not totally realistic but lots of fun and it would be cheering to think some of the evnts of the last century happened because of the way they unfolded in the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to readers that want something exciting to read and keeps you on the edge of  your toes. I have enjoyed all of the books and had a surprising ending.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing because it made me feel like this is a real person going through this and not oh a fake story about someone. It also gave me a different outlook on things in life. I recommend it and it brought me to tears.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Overall liked it a lot.  My only issues were so many songs are VERY long, and many had very similar sounds.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is a wonderful story and the acting is really superb.  I enjoyed it very much and was happy to find it on Amazon<br />Prime.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I play this on my laptop as well and it is awesome. it challenges me and I love it.  so worth it :)
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This was definitely surprising. It was beautifully made and the storyline was good. My three year old really loved it! A great movie for the whole family!
B00569K7EY|1.0|I had to return it because it had restricted to play when I tried to play it-I wasn't re-reimbursed for the shipping charge and I had to pay over $9.00 to return it! I will never purchase anything from you again!!!!!

B00CE379IM|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. The books were better though. Thats how it always goes though with most movies vs books
B00BVVA138|5.0|Possibly the album from Killswitch yet. I was not looking forward  to this cd since Howard left but the band still kicks ass.  Jesse has a different sound but is could be better for the band.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|We enjoyed the movie. Cute storyline... Humor very enjoyable for a family movie night. not much more you can really say then that
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was a decent book with interesting people. I wanted more connection and excitement overall, however. Would not recommend highly.
B00C1S945G|5.0|Probably the best season in the whole show, such great stories and characters, and the budget clearly increased from earlier seasons
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game!!!!! Recommend breeding the Dragons and try to get to level 11.<br />Good luck. Oh almost forgot to tell you their was a rainbow Dragon that you can't breed.
