B00902MCVY|5.0|I was a huge fan of Wintersun's first album. This album, although short on length, and really only 3 full songs, is still exceptional, sounds excellent the whole way through and has incredibly melodic and memorable sections. Hopefully Time II will come out quicker than it took for this one to come out. You will find yourself listening to it over and over just to hear all the nuance.<br /><br />Overall great. Cant wait for the next one.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Amazing book by Louisa May Alcott. I really recommend this book. It was a great book start to finish. My favorite character was Margaret.(Meg)
B003R17BV0|4.0|Good video about an actual event, although I believe they took a few liberties with the truth to make a more interesting movie.  The relationship between the golfer and his 10 year old caddie was dead on though.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Cowboys and Aliens is an interesting take on an old genre.  The movie is actually entertaining even if it didn't quite hit at the box office.<br /><br />One reason might be that Daniel Craig (who comes across as a tough-as-boots Wild West James Bond here and is practically the same character) wasn't quite the most commercial choice for this vehicle.  In another world, it might have been Brendan Fraser, Robert Downey, The Rock or Vin Diesel.  Craig does a great job as a man in search of his past, but his hard edged Clint Eastwood with flashbacks doesn't quite cut the heroic figure we want to root for.<br /><br />Neither is the show an Alien vs. Predator suspense filled green gore fest.  The aliens are passable but not scary, so that might explain how the execution didn't fly.  It either needed to be ALIEN adult themed project or a family friendly Cowboy film.  It ends up being a bit of both.  There are inconsistencies as to how to kill the alien in the show - and I won't go into spoilers here - but you will get over this as you suspend belief or not!<br /><br />The concept works for the most part as an ensemble piece:  Harrison Ford finds his groove as the war-hardened Colonel and Olivia Wilde is fetching as the mysterious damsel.  Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown and Keith Carradine are ideally casted and there in the mix, but could have done much more.  A bit more circling the wagons, a Fort Alamo....hey, let's just enjoy the film.<br /><br />This was definitely watchable and ok for the kids.  Part Disney, Part Bond, Part Retired Hans Solo helmed by Iron Man Director Jon Favereau.....  3.5 stars
B009NY43NY|2.0|I could not wait for the last Sookie Stackhouse book to come out. With an original date of March 7, 2013 thought I could get it as an early birthday present to myself however it did not come out until May. No wonder, Charlaine probably struggled to keep her interest in writing it. Was this book even written by Charlaine! If it was it seems she just wanted to get it done and put it to rest (or grave). What a boring book! While reading I hoped at some point it would pick up and I would have that incredible urge to read at every available moment of my day. That did not happen.  Waste of money and time!

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Not too hard but challenging enough to be a good way to pass the time
B00BEXB18M|5.0|It is a pretty good album!!! Don't listen to the bad reviews. I love kingmaker, burn, dance in the rain, built for war, beginning of sorrow, forget to remember and the thin lizzy cover. It's actually fun to see them putting a cover song on an album, it's like the old days of peace sells. people will say it is risk part 2 but i think its just Megadeth being Megadeth. It's good that they are making the music the way they always wanted too. Pick up Super Collider you will not be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am addicted. I didn't think that I was going to like it at first, because it took me a minute to get the timing down. Now that I have it my grandkids, and I play all the time. Of all the games we have installed, I can truly say, I enjoy Subway Surfer the most. IT ROCKS (in my granddaughter's voice)!!!!!!!!!!
B006964E8S|5.0|This story had me 'hooked' right from the start. The well thought- out plot, with interesting characters, kept weaving and had me guessing all the way. Open seam gas mining (fracking) is in its infancy in Australia and receiving growing resistance. This setting of above ground mining was also another interesting aspect.

B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I've read a lot of reviews based on the fact that Disney isn't packaging the 3D and the 2D versions together.  I don't really care about that as it is the movie itself that I have a problem with.  Taking a classic film like The Wizard OF Oz and constructing a prequel was a great idea in theory.  The previews made it look amazing and magical.  But see the film and you'll see how weak it is from start to finish.  Terrible acting, a watered down plot, no real suspense and you never care about any of the characters.  There's hardly even any laughs or scenes that make up for the incredibly dull plot.  During the whole film, you are just waiting for it to pick up the pace and get better, but it never gets there.  Really disappointed in this one.  They had all the tools to make something truly magical and they just let it fall flat.  Too bad.
B000002KBU|5.0|I love this CD I bought it for one song but have been delighted with all the songs. A must for anyone's collection
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best acted and most elaborately staged productions I have ever seen and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to see a simply wonderful series.
0425263916|3.0|The following in parenthesis is my response to a FaceBook comment about this trilogy. \\"I'm currently reading Reflected in You (I'm halfway through) and can't remember why I liked the first book. There is so much NOT happening in this story. Maybe I should have reread the first book again because on its own this book just sucks.\\"<br /><br />I have a feeling that Sylvia Day was approached by her publisher asking her to make a trilogy like 50 Shades but different. I have a sneaky feeling that she only had enough material for two books and not three. You can skip the first seven chapters of Reflected in You. It's all about Eva's and Gideon's insecurities, self deprecation and lust for each other. Read chapter 8 to get a feel of the first seven chapters. The end of chapter 9 is where the action starts. I must admit that the end of the story left me wanting to order the third book, which I did. I went back to read some of the first book and it WAS really good. I hope the third book is as good as the first.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|$45 list for a disc that ships without a 2D version??? Seriously??? Most every other 3D volume that I've ever bought (and I own most of them) ships with a 2D companion disc. You won't find me biting on this one, Mousie dear. Not until I can buy one that ships with 3D AND 2D in the same edition will I buy this one. Testing how hard you can squeeze us, eh? Well, speaking as a guy who owns most of the 3D titles out there, I won't be adding this one. Shame on you, Mousie dear.

0385344333|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I sped through this book in like a day. The suspense is top-notch. But I feel like due to his sky-rocketing popularity now, that he has to shoot out books way too fast now. This novel felt very rushed and had such a weird ending I thought. The whole book was leading up to some big finish and then all the sudden Reacher finds the guy and it's just over and then he goes hitchhiking again. I miss the story-telling that he perfects so well in other books, like Killing Floor, The Hard Way, 61 Hours, Worth Dying For; he told stories in those. In \\"The Wanted Man\\" I feel like it is just kind of a dose of action thrown into a formula that created a few hundred pages for a book. I know this isn't Lee Child's fault, he is a great author. It just seems they got him forcing out his books quicker than he'd like now.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|To preface this, I'm a hard rock QOTSA &quot;bring back the robots&quot; kinda guy. I love tracks like Song for the Deaf, Infinite, etc.<br /><br />This album is not that kind of QOTSA album, but it's still great. It is dark, intricate and beautiful - perhaps moreso than any album I've ever found in the rock genre, and a completely different animal than their previous albums. Josh's flippant attitude has nearly completely vanished, replaced by a self-reflective, doubtful conscience worried about who he is, past decisions, time slipping by, and an uncertain future.<br /><br />The sound itself is one part Lullabies to Paralyze, one part Them Crooked Vultures, with a little bit of Eagles of Death Metal influence and a couple &quot;ballads&quot;. You can hear influences from Josh's other bands on almost every song; those other bands are clearly not Josh doing something different now... it's what his music as a whole is becoming, and QOTSA sounds more like them than ever before because of it (for better or for worse). Some people say it sounds raw... I disagree. I think whoever mixed the sound this time did a much better job than on the prior albums. The production value is very high here and the layering of sounds is extremely precise and impressive. It's not a very &quot;muddy&quot; QOTSA record and that's a good thing.<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />1. Keep Your Eyes Peeled - boding and heavy, a slow burning dark entry to the record<br />2. I Sat By The Ocean - Groovy and almost poppy, fit for radio, but the lyrics show something much darker than the music would by itself. Has a bit of an Eagles of Death Metal feel to it.<br />3. The Vampyre of Time and Memory - More of a dark ballad than anything. An introspective song displaying more raw emotion than anything you would have heard by QOTSA prior to this.<br />4. If I Had A Tail - Mix up QOTSA and Them Crooked Vultures and you get this. Pretty cool song.<br />5. My God Is The Sun - the closest thing to a &quot;typical&quot; QOTSA song on this album, and fit for radio play.<br />6. Kalopsia - dark, weird and beautiful. A ballad that disintegrates into a hard attack.<br />7. Fairweather Friends - Feat. Elton John (but, as Josh said, there are no &quot;take it away Elton&quot; moments). Sounds VERY much like a Them Crooked Vultures song. Some swagger and humor is back in this song too.<br />8. Smooth Sailing - Homme Swagger in full effect. Very much resembles the Eagles of Death Metal, but has a definite darker edge to it, and a KILLER guitar riff near the end.<br />9 I Appear Missing - absolutely the opus of this album, and possibly Josh Homme's best song to date. An emotional rollercoaster and a whirlwind to listen to.<br /><br />t's a very emotional record. They weren't kidding when they said they rode out some dark feelings and experiences when making this. Honestly I kind of wonder and hope Josh is doing OK after hearing this album; it sounds like he went through some real hardships that influenced this record. But God, is it dark, intricate, and beautiful. And Michael Shuman on bass is FANTASTIC... he's an absolute driving force, in a completely different way than Nick was - something that's been missing for the past couple albums in my opinion.<br /><br />Only negatives in my opinion: I'd prefer a couple more songs (total is 10 tracks, ~45 minutes), and I can really tell now that Josh isn't spreading out his genres as much as he used to with his different bands... they're starting to converge, and it's clear that the robot guitar attacks are really and truly dead, not just taking a break. I'm sad about that, but good lord does he make some beautiful music now.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg, what can I say about this book. When I first saw this book, I was like oh i'm not going to like it. Except I did, It was wonderful. It was like a breath of fresh air. No I'm serious.  The story is told in the male's perspective. When you read it, the author made you feel like you were getting an inside look into the male head. I can't count how many times I laughed because he would say something that the male gene would be thinking, and would clarify it if for us female audience. It was hilarious! I can't wait for the next book. This author is now one of favorite authors. In the book we meet Drew Evans. He works for his father's company. His father hires Katherine Brooks. They have a \\"project\\" they they both are bidding on at work. One of them must loose in order for the other one to get the job. The present each of their \\"projects\\" to his father, and his father picks \\" \\". ( i'm not going to tell you which one) Of course we meet the rest of his family and her's.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is an awesome novel.<br />My task is to describe the story without spoiling it for future readers. I will do this by posing a series of questions.<br />How does an act of kindness impact the future of an emotionally and physically abuse boy as he grows into manhood?<br />Does capture and torture have to remove our humanity?<br />Do leaders of a society have the right to impose restrictions on that society forever?<br />Is change and adaption necessary or even right?<br />Are we all flawed and just doing the best we can under the circumstance that influence us?<br />Is love only for the perfect?<br />Nalini poses these questions and others to her characters and those answers are what make this novel great.
B00CW665VI|5.0|5++++ fabulous stars!!<br />A new favorite book!!<br />Highly recommended!!!<br />This story is told by Drew like he's talking to you. Ever saw Ferris Bueller's Day Off? Its just like that, and it's freaking brilliant! I love me some Drew!<br />I laughed out loud at so many parts! There is one part involving a drink being thrown and a picture of a full drink is shown as he says don't do it, then the next page is the liquid being thrown, and he says she did it. My husband looked at me like I was crazy when I couldn't stop laughing.<br />Trust me folks you will want to read this book!!<br />5 hilarious stars!

B003WUYOQ6|3.0|The author's earlier book \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" is exhaustive examining massive amounts of historical data of various research projects from the 1800s through now in order to justify the low carb approach to better health.  It is almost fanatical in detail.  There is a lot of technical information regarding diabetes and cholesterol among other health issues.  The author points out issues with prior and current research projects and suggests what should be considered priorities for future research.<br /><br />It was a very long read due to the amount of technical detail, however I felt it was a much better and more informative book compared to the author's more recent book \\"Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It\\".  I found the second book didn't cover as many issues as the first book.  The first half of \\"Why We Get Fat\\" is mostly the research data and the second half is more the \\"What to Do About It.\\"<br /><br />Neither is a diet book per se but justification of low carb diets.  I recall only one mention of surgical approach to weight loss and not much really about emotional eating beyond cravings for carbs and will power.<br /><br />I was reading a review on the latest (news) celebrity's book on food addiction and I chose to read both of Taubes' books instead of the new celebrity book because of the reviewer's comments and reference to Taubes.  I've always been a proponent of low carb theory because it is the most successful approach for me.  It is a lot to read but also gave me some technical understanding as I see family members face diabetes.<br /><br />Perhaps too much technical detail, but worth the effort for the information.  If you only read one, I'd read the lengthy \\"Good Calories\\" over the newer \\"Why We Get Fat.\\"<br /><br />Format: Borrowed ebook

B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|Revision to earlier review: I purchased this set several months back and when playing found that none of the movies have subtitles available, as I have a significant hearing problem that is a big issue in my enjoyment of these videos. REVISION: I have since writing the original review found that subtitles do exist for all of the movies.  Subtitles for \\"The Deathly Hollows\\" part 1 and part 2 are found as a tab under \\"Languages\\" as normally found (I hadn't viewed either of these at the time of the original review).  Subtitles for the other six movies can be located in the drop-down menu that contains choices for the aspect ratio and display items.  For me, the blue tag marked ABC was the selection that turned on/off the subtitles.  The quality of the movies that I did play were clearly up to \\"Blu-Ray\\" quality, with each of the movies, up to the Deathly Hollows pair, the movie disc contained options to view the movie's associated \\"special features\\" and a number of related interviews that were interesting. Both of the Deathly Hollows movies had a separate \\"special features\\" disc.  I have upgraded my evaluation of this set to four stars, from three stars, as finding the subtitle \\"switch\\" made a big improvement in my enjoyment and satisfaction with this movie set.

0451232852|4.0|The story begins in the year 1911. Unbeknownst to the civilized world, it is on the cusp of the first World War. A Bosnian Serb student, Gavrilio Princip, assassinated the heir to the Austrian throne; thereby knocking over the first domino that ticked through diplomatic efforts so pathetic as to be tantamount to a farce, drawing in Germany to support Austria. Then the regrettably located, France.  Dominoes ticked through trade routes pulling in the resource and leadership poor Russia.  Then pompous England waved their flag, while then the dominoes clattered through the minor powers, finally drawing in a reluctant United States. The tumbled dominoes are then erected as tombstones for the nearly ten million fallen soldiers. An atrocity that precipitates the fall of the remaining major aristocracies. The Fall of Giants. Indeed.<br /><br />Had I not read two of Ken Follett's other historical novels, I never would have even set my finger on the binding to pull it from the shelf. I have long believed that war doesn't decide who is right; only who is left. The gore of the battlefield is too real in my overactive imagination, war strategy too far beyond my intellect and our world leaders are too oft obstinate old men who happily trade their country's brave young soldiers for mangled corpses, all to play some great game.<br /><br />Despite all that, I loved this book.<br /><br />The characters compelling and real. As I watched events spiral through their eyes, I found myself hopeful that events already written in the tomes of world history wouldn't happen. I despaired with them as it all happened anyway. I felt the percussion of mortar blasts as I curled up in my dugout. I heard the whiz of bullets as I leapt from mortar hole to mortar hole. I felt the hunger that compelled soldiers to sit and eat captured food stores as corpses cooled on the ground.<br /><br />I felt exalted as the Russian people rose up against the Tsar and their ridiculously corrupt government. I held Lenin in equal parts awe and distaste, and was saddened when the revolution went sour. I felt proud of my fellow American, Gus, when he stopped a Russian policeman from brutalizing a peasant girl, then treated her with kindness. \\"No Russian would address a peasant so courteously.\\"<br /><br />I cheered for Billy Twice when he spoke against the English aristocracy with the wisdom to effect change while avoiding outright revolution. I cheered for Ethel and Maud as they fought for women's suffrage and equal rights for women workers. I was relieved when Germany signed the armistice and was disappointed when the allies used it as an opportunity to revile Germany and impose impossible reparations, making World War II an all but foregone conclusion.<br /><br /> I learned more about this time period than ever before because I wasn't subjected to some dry, third person, Americans-are-so-great version of events, I lived it through these remarkable, albeit fictitious, characters.<br /><br />Synopsis<br /><br />This story begins in a fictional small mining town called Aberowen, England, where we meet our first two main characters, newly initiated miner, Billy and his sister, Ethel. Then we follow Ethel to Earl Fitzherbert's country estate where she works as the head housemaid. At Fitz's estate we meet his Russian princess wife, Bea, his feminist sister, Maud, his boyhood companion,Walter, who is also a German diplomat, and an American diplomat, Gus. Later, we follow Gus to Russia where we meet Grigori and Lev, two young men that work for Putilov Machine Works building wheels for locomotives. Each of these strategically placed characters revealed a view of everyday life and politics from a new angle giving a fairly balanced view of the war.<br /><br />Billy (Welsh)<br />From Billy we see life as a coal miner living in a community of prefabricated homes working on a mine owned by an English earl. Mining coal in the early 20th century is incredibly hard labor and ridiculously dangerous. The mine operators are far more willing to sacrifice miners than they are willing to part with the funds to provide even the most basic safety equipment. Laborers are a commodity of inexhaustible supply.<br /><br />Billy doesn't particularly favor being a commodity. He is bright, brave and a natural leader. Once drafted, these qualities keep him and most of his Aberowen Pals alive during their service in the war. He exposes the ineptitude of the aristocracy that commanded them in battle and fights to end their power.<br /><br />Ethel (Welsh - Sister to Billy)<br />Ethel's quick wit and passionate visage captivates Earl Fitzherbert. After a short romance she becomes pregnant. Fitz attempts to pay Ethel off in attempt to discard her and the scandal that grows in her womb. She spend the rest of the story fighting for women's suffrage and equal rights with Fitz's sister, Maud, while also raising her son.<br /><br />Earl Fitzherbert (English Earl owner of the land containing Aberowen)<br />Fitz is a generally likable enough guy. He is courageous and believes what he does is the right thing, even when it isn't. You almost can't blame him because he comes from a long line of aristocrats and to a large degree was born (or made) that way. He suffers from an inferiority complex in which his constant desire to prove he's worthy of his title drives him to make bad decisions.<br /><br />Princess Bea (Russian born wife of Fitz)<br />Through Princess Bea we see how the Russian royalty holds the peasantry in utter disdain. They don't believe themselves simply separated by class so much as separated by species. Through her, we also feel the pain of the loss of her heritage and the brutal death of her brother during the Russian revolution.<br /><br />Maud (Sister to Earl Fitzherbert)<br />Maud's is a woman for the people, but certainly not a woman of the people. She has an enviable intellect, poise and bottomless pocketbook thanks to her indulgent brother, Fitz. I had to excuse her hypocrisy in favor of what she was trying to accomplish. She befriends Ethel to further her causes but never sees her as an equal, though both women are formidable. She and Walter fall in love prior to the war and spend most of the book in anguish as they remain loyal to their countries, while doing all they can for peace.<br /><br />Walter (German diplomat and friend to Fitz)<br />I had the most empathy for his character. Walter is an intelligent man with a good heart, whose ideas and maneuvering for peace are ignored again and again to the ruin of his beloved homeland, Germany. He spends the war separated from Maud and in a constant state of deprivation as he serves as an intelligence agent in the front lines of the war.<br /><br />Grigori (Russian metal worker and soldier)<br />Easily the toughest and most earnest character, Grigori raised his younger brother Lev, after his father was hanged for the crime of grazing his cattle land belonging to Princess Bea, and his mother was shot during a protest march in front of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Soon after the war begins, he is drafted in to the military and we see first hand the brutality of the officers, rampant corruption as the military supplies are sold on the black market, and terrible strategic moves as they waste the lives of their soldiers. We see the growing dissent of the soldiers which culminates into mutiny and revolution, of which Grigori's point of view provides a front row seat.<br /><br />Lev (Russian, Grigori's brother)<br />Lev is all charisma and no scruples. He takes Grigori's seat on the boat to America to escape the Russian police. The boat lands in Cardiff, England and he realizes he (well, his brother) has been conned. He eventually makes his way to America and we see life for a Russian immigrant working for a Russian mob boss.<br /><br />Gus (American diplomat)<br />Gus is easy to like. Tall, gangly, idealistic, and wicked smart he keeps the reader abreast of what is happening in the U.S. Government during this time. Through him we meet Woodrow Wilson, whom I admired and disliked all at once. He was a brilliant leader with the utmost of integrity, but growing up in the South left him bigoted. He conceived of the idea for a League of Nations that would later become the U.N., for the purpose of resolving conflicts between great nations.<br /><br />Once the United States joins the war effort, Gus enlists as an officer. Gus arrives in France as an officer in the Expeditionary Force and through him we witness the famous battle, Chateau-Thierry.<br /><br />The heroes in this particular story aren't forged in the heat of battle against the enemy.  They are the peasants, mine workers, factory workers and soldiers who fought their respective imperial rulers to form a new government that would allow their children to grow up served by their government rather than exploited by it; where leaders are chosen by virtue of their abilities and ethics rather than their breeding.<br /><br />Imperfect as democracy is, I'll take it, and I extend my deep gratitude for all of the lives lost fighting during our own revolution and civil war to make our country free, and to those who defend it to this day.<br /><br />Now for two minor gripes:<br />Ken Follett, writes a scene where Lev is nearly molested by a priest. I know this sort of thing happens, clearly, from his other books, but it seemed gratuitous. It makes me wonder if he has a personal bias as it was otherwise irrelevant to the story. He gets another dig in when Grigori is talking to a girl about the incident and she says something to the effect of, well--duh.<br /><br />I thought it a bit odd how many women were lost their virginity in this book. The scenes were fairly graphic too. Almost as if \\"Phil\\" from the marketing group said, \\"Ken our demographic for this book is xyz, so you need to write in more sex scenes and make `em virgins. ...and go.\\" Then he punches him in the arm and winks at him. Ken, nexttime tell that guy to go get bent.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I first watched this movie as a rental, and fell in love with it. It has such amazing graphics, and I love the movie overall. It is one of my all time favorites!
B007FH9GA6|4.0|The &#34;Americanization&#34; of the first film in the classic Swedish trilogy went better than expected. This certainly is no watered down version by any means and the opening credits start it all off with a bang. Wonderfully filmed, well acted, with Rooney Mara a total standout as the lead character. Dark, steely, cerebral, cold and almost clinical-sounds a lot like Seven or Zodiac. David Fincher has a very specific style and it shows throughout his filmography. Do be prepared for a LOT of dialogue and some fairly jolting &#34;under your skin&#34; violence. If you like your films sunny, fun, lightweight, and with a tidy ending, this is NOT the one for you. But if you like to be challenged and stimulated viscerally and this will be a film that you will enjoy.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is a boring, unintelligent throw up ride filled with lens flares and flashy, at-lightening-speed action scenes with handsome, sexy, two dimensional characters flashing their sexiness in front of said lens flares, reciting Star Trek jargon; This movie was a complete piece of trash as Star Trek.. It was an even worse dumbing down of a great sci-fi franchise to fit the attention span of the Jersey Shore generation than the first one by Abrams. The sheer fact of plagiarizing a past story devoid of all the emotional weight and resonance is probably enough to relegate it there.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams is obviously a Star Wars fan - everything in this movie (and the one before it) indicates that.<br /><br />The distinction between the two began to collapse altogether with J. J. Abrams's first Star Trek film in 2009, and its demise was rendered official with the news early this year that the director would also be taking over future installments of the Star Wars franchise. Abrams's latest outing, Star Trek Into Darkness represents a final burial.<br /><br />Let's face it, the man is not hired to produce quality movies, he is hired to produce marketable junk. And that he did. So much budget and money and all they could come up with was this boring junk of a tourist trinket that absolutely did not add anything to the world of Star Trek. Seriously. Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />The movie ruminates loudly, if never very coherently, about the typical fight of good vs evil that is so central to the theme of Star Wars; about war and peace, vengeance and justice, preemptive attack and negotiated settlement. Kirk and Spock having a destiny to be friends - as if the fabric of the universe as we know it would collapse if these two did not become friends or as if their friendship - among billions out there - was the one that had to transcend time and space. As if their friendship was the Jedi of friendships without which there can never be good in the universe.Completely absurd.<br /><br />Star Trek never cared for creating messiahs or holy men and the only time they did (Sisko as the Emissary) turns out that those prophets the Bajorans prayed to were beings existing on a different plane of existence.  No magic was in place. No destiny and messiah. Why these two _need_ to be friends eludes me. To bring the force and balance to the universe? So much so that the one message the old Spock had for humanity in this alternate timeline was not one on how to prevent wars and genocides and numerous atrocities but how these two need to remain friends no matter what timeline they are in? It is imperative to not divulge information regarding other events since they must fulfill their destiny as the old Spock put it, but it is ok to give Spock and Kirk pointers about their friendship that just must transcend time and space?<br /><br />Star Trek has always been about real people, however, not archetypes fulfilling destinies. Unlike Star Wars, Star Trek is not a fairy tale of good vs evil, heroes vs. villains. In Star Wars everyone is either a guru, a princess,  a chosen one but none of them - with the exception of Han Solo - was a real person. They were archetypes fighting the typical fight of good vs evil. Chosen prince vs dark emperor. We never find out what the force really is, what creates it and drives it. It is juts there and the story is about how to make the \\"force\\" work for you. That is entering a multitude of fairy tale territories, not science fiction.<br /><br />Note that science fiction is a \\"what if\\" scenario in which the effects of technology or technologies that currently do not exist are explored. Thus, it is \\"fiction\\" that revolves around such \\"science\\".<br /><br />In Star Wars, we do not have any of that. It is neither about humans (since there are no humans in Star Wars, just people called such) nor about the effects of science. In this case, the light saber and  hyperdrive may as well be Excalibur and chariots.<br/><br />Star Trek has also never had to rely on magical tricks and such to make the stories work. It's characters were real. Real people with real problems; with hopes, dreams, goals and careers - not abstract heroes fighting the good fight for the sake of fighting the good fight or taking revenge.<br /><br />All that has changed ever since Abrams has added his Star Wars flair and preference to the Trek world.<br /><br />The action sequences are plentiful and characterized by a certain gee-whiz exuberance. This being an Abrams/Lindelof venture, there are multiple sets of Daddy Issues to resolve. And we are subjected to an escalating experiment in the human tolerance for lens flare.<br /><br />The entire realization and reimagination of the Trek universe is just an insult to Gene Roddenberry and the Star Trek he had imagined starting with The Original Series to all the subsequent shows and movies under Roddenberry's and then his co-creator Rick Berman's supervision. And I am not talking about setup and scenery, I am talking about the themes inherent in Star Trek. This movie does not honor Roddenberry's vision at all.  It is not intelligent or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, it does not truly establish and explore its characters and their relationships with one another, there is no attempt at science, philosophy, morality and in understanding other cultures.<br /><br />If it was not for the Star Trek lingo and names of familiar characters, I would not believe that this is a Star Trek production. The plot holes are gaping and the internal consistencies - regardless of past productions - are staggering and too much to ignore. Here are just a few:<br /><br />1) Apparently orders are purely optional in this here Abrams' Star Trek. No one follows anyone's orders. If you don't wanna follow an order, just resign your commission and hang out in a bar and wait to be reinstated. Don't worry about a court martial or any kind of consequences. Abrams and his writers have completely failed to understand how military hierarchies work.<br /><br />2)Spock has been turned into a pedantic, stickler who seems to delight in sticking it to others (such as Kirk). He has none of the humor or the pathos that Prime Spock did in The Original Series or the movies.<br /><br />Mr. Quinto's idea of being a Vulcan is apparently just having no facial expression. That's all. Other than that, he's pretty emotional. Even with a bad script, Nimoy could add just a little something to indicate the depths of his character. Quinto adds nothing. He is mechanical when Spock is logical, and a blubbering tool when Spock is emotional. There's no middle ground, no subtlety, no mystery. Logic is an attitude, a way of life - you breathe, live, think and walk logic. It's not just lack of facial expression and pointy ears. Quinto's Spock with its fake, stagey references to logic and over usage of Star Trek lingo was beyond annoying and obviously placed in there not by people who actually understand, know and care about Star Trek but by people who've done their research and are strategically employing the lingo into the script and dialog to make it \\"Star Trek\\".<br /><br />Finally, the Uhura romance: it is hard to believe that Spock, who in this portrayal is a pedantic prissy a$$ bent on enforcing all rules no matter how picayune, would have a sexual relationship with one of his students. It just makes no sense, and it smacks of writers trying to \\"sex it up,\\" logic be damned.<br /><br />3) Kirk and Spock have absolutely no chemistry, and thus no camaraderie, between them. Or maybe it is Pine and Quinto. I don't know. Something is amiss. There is no basis for their friendship. In fact, there is nothing to indicate in the behavior of either that they even like each other, much less view each other as friends willing to sacrifice themselves for the other - as they did in the end. Nothing in the story indicates that, except for a script that expects us to just fill in the blanks in that regard.<br /><br />If I had only seen this and the previous movie, I would be absolutely clueless as to why these two are friends. In order for Kirk's sacrifice to evoke emotional resonance and make us want to care as the audience, it has to have meaning - which is to be found in the friendship. Here, no friendship has been established, only animosity. That was the case in the first movie and it is the case now as well.<br /><br />In The Wrath of Khan, even if you had seen nothing else from Trek, it was established in several scenes on screen that these guys are life long friends who care a great deal for each other. There are birthday presents, meaningful conversations about life and mortality, there are bonding moments between Kirk and Spock that make their friendship meaningful and give both characters depth and nuances.  This, in turn, allows the viewer to put the death scene in context.<br /><br />Here, there are fistfights explosions and insults. That's it. This is their \\"friendship.\\" So when Kirk sacrifices himself for Spock you cannot help but feel  a little lost. It is still unclear to me how Kurtzman and Orci get paid millions to come up with such lousy stories. This is not even about Star Trek or anything, this is just pure story telling - or lack thereof. Characters need to behave in ways that make sense and naturally follow from the story and actions of the characters - not just be implanted there because it is convenient.<br /><br />When Kirk said \\"I want you to know why I saved you on the planet,\\" I thought to myself: \\"Yeah! Me, too!\\"<br /><br />Spock yelling \\"Khan!!!!\\" belied the characterization of Spock, as well as being an expression of emotion that was unearned. But more importantly: KHAN WASN'T RESPONSIBLE for the malfunction on the ship that Kirk \\"sacrificed\\" himself to rectify. If anything, Spock should have been yelling \\"MARCUSSSSS!!\\"<br /><br />4) Star Trek, unlike Star Wars, is not driven by special effects and CGI. Special effects can't make you laugh, or cry, or care about anything or anyone. If nearly every scene consists of numbing space battles and CGI monster battles, it just gets tiring. The cacophony of action sequences just got boring after a while and it just felt gratuitous and pointless.<br /><br />5) Star Trek didn't have the benefit of metric tons of money to blow on effects (Well, real Star Trek doesn't, anyway). Instead, it had to make us care about characters, cultures, and organizations. I cared more about Captain Kirk dodging a foam rock than I ever cared about Obi-Wan McGregor fighting General Grievously Stupid. And I also don't care about Kirk going after the sociopath Khan in this movie either - because I was never given the chance to care about Kirk in the first place.<br /><br />Watching scene after scene of \\"pew-pew-pew-KABOOM!\\" just is not appealing to me. And that is the problem: nothing intelligent happens in this movie. There are battles and wars every once in a while in Star Trek, but mostly, there are science fiction stories that describe the universe and its societies, instead of blowing them all up.<br /><br />6) The Klingons and Kronos: the former looked nothing like the Klingons we have ever seen in any Trek version and Kronos looked like a freaking sound stage. The bridge of the Enterprise still looks like a Bloomingdale's make up counter and more technologically advanced than the slip stream drive ships of 2378 in Star Trek: Voyager. Dialog and \\"character\\" development consist of \\"Bones\\" making a weird face and cracking lame jokes, putting a newbie in charge of engineering because the chief engineer decided to not follow orders and Uhura making the brilliant observation and complaint about Spock having no feelings and not showing them to her. Well, no NO KIDDING GENIUS. When did that occur to you? When he said he was VULCAN and on his way to embrace only logic?<br /><br />7) Overall, the aliens, the action scenes and overall demeanor of the show resembled more a Star Wars meets Transformers meets Jack Bourne production than Star Trek. The story did not revolve around the effects that these technologies, such as eugenics in this case, have or had on Humans and their society. In fact, they did not explore, comment on or critique the Eugenics wars at all - something which is a central theme for the Khan arc and especially central to the concept of Star Trek - which is all about how technology and science affect humans/humanoid civilization and life as opposed to just chasing down archetypes of bad guys while rewarding the \\"good guys.\\"<br /><br />8) Boy the directors must have studied Memory Alpha since their new favorite word used was the Prime Directive. And don't even get me started on the Section 31 garbage stolen from DS9 and misplaced in this universe. And then that \\"permission to come on the bridge\\" garbage by a stowaway bimbo in a short skirt whose principle role in the film is to appear briefly in her underwear, thus achieving the dual purposes of supplying Kirk with a romantic interest for the next installment and also being an expert in weapons of mass destruction? WTF?<br /><br />9) One of my expectations, which is apparently a foolish one, was that the iconic Khan Noonian Singh, a Sikh character, would not be whitewashed and played by a white, British guy, Benedict Cumberbatch, but by someone of East Indian descent or maybe at least someone resembling someone from such a background. With his casting choice of a Caucasian man in the form of Cumberbatch, J.J. Abrams has proven that he doesn't even humor us anymore. He didn't even attempt to make the character at least resemble  someone with East Indian origins.<br />Roddenberry's vision, I think not.<br /><br />Now before people jump my throat saying that the original Khan wasn't played by an East Indian either, consider this: back in the 60s, when Ricardo Montalbán was cast to play Khan (a character explicitly described in the episode script of \\"Space Seed\\" as being Sikh, from the Northern regions of India), he had huge racial barriers and bigotry to overcome in a society where racism and segregation were institutionalized. The pressures Roddenberry faced from the television networks to cast \\"sensibly\\" as he put it were immense and serious and are well documented. Therefore, for the 60s and the times he was in, having a brown-skinned man (Montalbán) play a brown character was a hard-won victory.<br /><br />Fast forward some 40+ years later where apparently despite all our changes as a society supposedly embracing diversity, inclusion and otherness, we see that not only has nothing changed with respect to executive demands for \\"sensible\\" casting, but we see that said producers and film makers are not even trying to hide their attempts at bigotry.<br /><br />Just this week Abercrombie and Fitch was under fire (as they have been for years now) for portraying their brand and image towards the run-of-the-mill homogenous blonde, blue eyed, chiseled-ab folks. Yet here we got a movie that does exactly the same thing, and people think it's a hit and brilliant and supposedly so very true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />It's disappointing and demoralizing that with the commercial power of Star Trek in his hands, JJ Abrams chose not to honor the original spirit of the show, or the symbolic heft of the Khan character, but to wield the whitewash brush for ... what? The hopes that casting Benedict Cumberbatch would draw in a few more box office returns?<br /><br />10) The characterization of Khan in this movie was just plain wrong and reduced Khan just to the archetypal villain as opposed to a complex, brilliant character.  The Khan from Space Seed was ruthless, but he wasn't cruel for cruelty sake. He was a tyrant, not a sociopath, and there's a big difference. He marooned the crew of the Reliant, he didn't kill them. in cold blood. Khan in this movie, on theother hand, crashing the ship and, in particular, the -violence on the bridge of the Vengeance was really awful and depicted Khan as nothing but the archetypal villain rather than the intelligent, brilliant, and ferocious man that he was.<br /><br />Overall I think that as a story about revenge and anger (if you don't care about anything else and are a teenager, that is) it's pretty OK. Khan is a maniac terrorist. Boo, we hate terrorists. Check. Kirk hates this particular terrorist because he gunned down his surrogate daddy. Yay, we like revenge! Check. Love story between the withholding man and hot woman who is crazy about him. We love love stories. Check. Obligatory blonde model-slash-actor superfluous character to add a young and sexy \\"edge\\" to the show plus a possible love interest for Pine, Yaay! We all want to see him hooking up with a blonde model -slash -actor, yaay! Check.<br /><br />I guess it works on a very broad scale. But the question now is, how many more vengeance and anger stories can be told? Kirk is running out of daddies, and now death can be cured with a handy injection, whatdo'ya know. Isn't that nifty?<br /><br />Since this was a reboot of the franchise and conveniently taking place in an alternate timeline, the writers were given a white canvas to work with and come up with new ideas and ways to imagine the Trek Universe and take out heroes on journeys they have not gone yet, not rehash the past and redo something, such as The Wrath of Khan, that was brilliant as is and did not need redoing.<br /><br />Alas, there are alien creatures to be chased, fugitive baddies to capture, Klingons to stare down, and special effects budgets to be spent. Therefore, enter the openly dizzy way that is Star Trek as only a Star Wars business-man fan can imagine it, namely as a more recognizable heir to George Lucas than to Gene Roddenberry.<br /><br />As a side note: I am tired of hearing people excuse all the crap writing and lousy inconsistencies as \\"well itis the parallel universe.\\" So what? You don't need to create engaging characters we care about, internal consistency, great story telling and a great script because it is the parallel universe? Or alternate timeline? I also have to agree with someone else who mentioned that Abrams is actually doing the franchise a huge disservice. The stuff that's been going down in this and also the previous movie is the kind of lazy bu.ll crap that takes my evaluation beyond \\"these are simply bad writers\\" and into \\"these people actively disdain the thing they've been entrusted with.\\"<br /><br />In the end when Khan had his torpedoes or whatever directed at \\"Enterprise\\" I was really hoping he kills all these losers and puts an end to this terrible reimagination of the Star Trek franchise by a Star Wars fan.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|This film is one of the very few examples of a remake being at least equal to the original. This one is a perfect marriage of the right actors for the leads, good writing, great filming. The entire film depends on-and must have-an excellent chemistry between the two leads-and it has that in spades. Bronson and Russo are near perfect together. Think of this one as a sort of James Bond-lite type of film. Fun, witty, beautifully filmed and beautiful to look at. Never overly violent or vulgar. Makes a fun double feature with the original McQueen Dunaway feature

B003XQM2YU|4.0|Fun movie to watch. I always enjoy the historical action movies. Had very nice set design, costumes, special effects, and acting.
B00C1N9JWO|3.0|I love Nalini Singh books, both Psy-Changeling and Guild Hunter, I recommend them to all my friends. I spend the time leading up to this book re-reading the previous books in the series.<br /><br />I was very much looking forward to this story and while it is a great addition to the Psy-Changeling narrative, as a stand alone book it's very disjointed. I love what happens in that world, but the main character's relationship doesn't feel as it did in other books. For example, in the Mercy/Riley book we saw Mercy having a genuine interactions with her siblings. Here the connection the heroine had with her relatives did not feel as real, it's like we saw the end result without the heart being built. Specifically, the Sahara's relationship with Leon and Faith felt unreal. Then her having fresh new shields, but we never saw her interactions with Sascha in helping her build them, just backfill on Kaleb remembering that Sascha was the best shield tech he'd ever seen (which was mentioned in other books, so yes).<br /><br />This is supposed to be an epic love story that changes the path of the Psy and it feels like Kaleb & \\"Mary Sue\\". The special powers, the lack of give and take between the characters... did the author change editors?<br /><br />Anyway, for fans, I recommend the book as part of the arc of the Psy-Changeling world, but maybe wait for the paperback version. For those new to the series, don't start here.

Most of the time, they are forcing every posible quirk into their songs in an attempt to inject life into their music. Wretched, annoying life.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Will this book change your life?  Is it a game changer?  I don't know.  That requires a lot of personal reflection - it's your life, your game.  What I do know is that James hits you in the gut with a raw, no-holds-barred perspective of the times we live in and provides some insights that every reader should giving serious consideration.<br /><br />I've followed James' blog for several months now and he delivers his message in the same powerful, unvarnished, and conversational style that characterizes his blog.  This is my first Amazon review - and for any skeptics out there, I only know James through the writings on his blogs and some of his previous books - anyway, I was hesitant to write this as he devotes a whole chapter on opinions.  Spoiler Alert - it's titled \\"Don't Have Any Opinions\\".  Of course there's much more to it than that.  If you decide to 'Choose Yourself' you have to be prepared to take a stand . . . to have viewpoints, share opinions and put yourself 'out there'.  In my opinion, this book is a must read!<br /><br />James takes you on a great ride.  It's a dire warning about the future, a personal story - the literal open book into his life from the highs to the extreme lows, and back again and a guide to the unlimited possibilities available to all of us.  It's inspiring, courageous and a forceful call to action.  I couldn't put it down, reading it from beginning to end in less than a day.<br /><br />If you find yourself waiting for the world to return to 'normal', pre-2007, you need to read this book, reflect on your life and work, consider his Daily Practice and seriously think about Choosing Yourself.<br /><br />Finally, James offers a money-back option or an option to donate his proceeds to charity if you read his book - he believes in his message that much.  I believe in it too, but I'm not asking for my money-back - his message is that good!

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|I'm a big ABBA , Agnetha and Frida  Fan, so any new music from any of them I'm ready to buy it.<br />Saying that, I've not always been completely pleased with some of the songs from Agnetha;s past solo Albums.<br /><br />What I didn't care for in her past solo albums was the music, her voice as always is beautiful as ever.<br />Agnetha's new album 'A'  has a beautiful blend of Agnetha's amazing voice and wonderful music together, that while listening to the songs you get a wonderful relaxing feeling.<br /> Even though some of the songs are about a love gone wrong , the way Agnetha sings and the music still gives you an uplifting feeling.<br /><br />Every song on this album in my opinion, is a masterpiece, well crafted of high quality. One song that makes me love the album even more is  'Dance your pain away\\" .  For me, by Agnetha recording this song, it's like she's saying to her gay fans that she knows we're out there and this song is just for us and she loves us too.<br /><br />I would recommend Agnetha's album 'A' to anyone who loves great music, Agnetha , ABBA fan or not.<br /><br />Agnetha, Thank you for the Music !
B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie is very action packed from the beginning to the end; it makes me wonder how in the world they got some of those shots with so many different angles; it has a plot, it has the evil person, it has weapons of mass destruction, and it also makes one wonder if it is possible to do -- great movie all around!

B0046XMTZG|3.0|It's almost a good movie, but it falls short because it is over the top fantasy.  The best Jonah Hex rendition was in the 1994 Batman cartoon (The one with the art deco style animation).
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|I watched this film years ago, and felt moved by it. I recently bought it on Amazon and just watched it last night. First off, I might say that the film is a long one but needs to be, in the same way Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi' is long and David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' is long; it needed to be long to convey this highly interesting man's life and all the complexities and even contradictions of Malcolm X's life. Why should a white working class person from England really be interested in a black working class guy from America anyway? Well, why not? Malcolm X the film stands comparison with the two films I just mentioned because Malcolm X is an important person in the history of civil rights in America and perhaps the whole world.<br /><br />Malcolm, in his life, went from being a tough thug and former jailbird, into a civil rights leader for his people, with an extremely sharp brain and some of the most uncompromising and electrifying speeches you've ever heard. It's been said that Martin Luther King was a man of peace and Malcolm was a man of war, but I feel that both men were two sides of the same coin, and when it really boils down to it, were 'fighting' for the same thing, which was emancipation for black people in America, all kinds of emancipation, certainly economic emancipation.<br /><br />There is a kind of feeling that comes to me from the time of Malcolm X; America was changing and all kinds of people, not just black people, were beginning to feel that they deserved a bigger slice of the pie and demanding fairness and equality and perhaps most importantly economic justice so that it wasn't just white middle and upper class people who could live well and prosper but everybody. The same things were probably happening in Britain but on a more understated level. For me quite simply, when black people and other ethnic minorities stand up for their rights and their social justice, it can also be about ALL people who are oppressed, in one way or the other, fighting for their rights. In America, it was much about racism and probably still is, in Britain, although I won't tell you there isn't racism here because there is, it can also be about class. In Britain, like many other countries, certain white people are allowed to prosper, perhaps because they have been to private schools and they talk with the 'right' accent and know the 'right' people and are connected or have influence in one way or the other; if you aren't part of this clique you are meant to accept it and fight for the crumbs of the rich man's table. Malcolm X teaches me that we all have dignity and we all have the right to challenge oppression wherever we find it, and especially in our own lives.<br /><br />So, the movie. A really good film, notwithstanding its length, and one that I could watch again and again. Denzel Washington is absolutely convincing as Malcolm X and is as usual enormously charismatic in the role. The film goes from Malcolm's early life to the very end, where he is assassinated whilst giving a speech. It is a sad end of an amazing life. As the film, and Malcolm's life progresses, there is the feeling that Malcolm is shedding his skin; he sheds the skin of his life of crime to re-educate himself in prison and then becomes an apostle of the honourable Elijah Muhammad; he sheds his skin again after feeling badly let down by Muhammad, and becomes a free spirit. He goes to Mecca and finds that all kinds of people, of all different colours including white, are all worshipping together. I feel this made a strong impact on him and he began to see all humanity, not just black people, as worthy of concern, love and consideration.<br /><br />In the racial climate of America in those times, it could be easy to understand that someone black would despise white people and the mainstream white culture of America; it is then good to say that Malcolm X at the end of his life changed his perspective and had the courage of his doubts and convictions and began to see the bigger picture. He was a great man.nd began to see the bigger picture. He was a great man.

B004EPYZSU|4.0|Cowboys and Aliens is a great example of a film that if it had came out during the 1990's, would have dominated the box office.  It had a star-studded cast, great special effects, an original script, respectable acting, and an original soundtrack.  However, coming out in 2011, after fans were spoiled with the POTC, LOTR, Harry Potter, and various Marvel and DC comic franchises, this movie did OK at the box office.  The movie itself is an innovative mix of science fiction and western genres, with a mix of comedy and suspense thrown in.  All of it is very authentic.  The western part of the movie is quite believable as we have both cowboys and Indians and innocent town-folk.  I especially like the portrayal of the Indians, as one of the sub-themes of the movie was the struggle of one character to find acceptance among white society, while not trying to alienate his fellow Native Americans.  The science fiction portion of the movie is standard fare; i.e. aliens coming to Earth.  However, there is one original bonus, and that is the character played by Olivia Wilde.  Being a fan of alien invasion movies, her role was new to me, and quite good in making the plot more interesting.<br /><br />This package features the standard Blu-ray and DVD discs.  The package comes with both the theatrical and extended editions; hence there is no extraneous deleted or alternate scenes anywhere.  The disc also features the typical director commentary, previews of other movies, and \\"making of\\" extras routine for Blu-Rays nowadays.  Overall, a good buy at around $10 and an entertaining movie to boot.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Often times felt I was back in lecture hall however the message was enlightening. Was a long read, but well worth it. Introverts mind is much more powerful than an extroverts mouth. If given the choice to be led into battle by an introvert vs an extrovert. Introvert wins hands down!!

Def like this one a lot better in terms of quality of sound, however I find the elastics on it come off quite often and the actual cable to connect to your device feels cheap and flimsy.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As soon as it downloaded to my kindle I didn't put this story down until I finished it. The storyline needs what happens in this book. Sure there are more questions asked, but isn't that part of the experience of reading a series? You also get some answers and you see G & E grow stronger together. And WOW loved the plane scene!! Can't wait for the next!!!
0470503696|5.0|Great book and much better than other books in the &#34;for Dummies&#34; library. I normally don't like the &#34;Dummies&#34; books but this one is actually pretty good. I think it would be very difficult to tailor a book to a vast audience but they did a pretty good job of that here.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|With each entry Fallen Tree Games has continued to improve on it's almost perfect first game quell. Quell Reflect was a slight upgrade compared to the first, adding additional water droplets and a few gameplay additions. However with Memento they went all out. This is easily worth the asking price, improving on the first 2 games while maintaining the relaxed feel of the series.  A little easy so far, I've beaten the first 4 level sets, and only now on ray of light have I had to put any thought into perfecting any of the levels.

People who are more looking for recipes will find the last part of the book useful but will find the beginning and middle parts probably boring.  If you're a brewer who wants to know as much about ingredients as possible this is a great book.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What is there to say about this book? First I loved it and I was totally blown away by the character development of Eva.  She has grown so much since the first book that I couldn't help but cheer for her when she decided to not \\"loose it\\" when Gideon disappeard or other difficult situations occurred.  I also understand why there will be 2 more books in the series...... not sure I can list them all but there are so many relationships that need worked on and stories to finish.  I have a heard  a number of interviews with Ms. Day where she talks about how closed Gideon is and it's hard for her to tell the story from his pov but hopefully he'll open up so we can understand more about where he is coming from which will hopefully resolve some of his difficult relationships with his family. I think I\\"ll go read it again!!!!  Cheers!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is my new favorite of the psy/changeling books. Before, it was a toss up between Caressed by Ice and Kiss of Snow. There are so many things I loved about this book but I will try to narrow it down so I don't write a novel myself.<br /><br />First, the mysteries are solved. Gotta love that. The ghost is revealed, and if you're not surprised, that just means you're as smart as me and paid attention to the other books. Some may be disappointed by the lack of total surprise, but really, did you want to be shocked so badly that you felt misled in the previous books? And the reveal was done in such a perfectly wonderful way. Another mystery solved is the missing chunks of time in Kaleb's early training with Santano Enrique. And let me just say that was a shocker if you needed one! Even though the thought had crossed my mind, it was still a jaw dropping moment. And the heroine, where has she been and why does Kaleb care.. All that comes to light.<br /><br />Another thing I truly loved about this book is that Kaleb remains true to his character. He's never been Mr. Nice Guy and he sure as heck isn't starting now. Most authors will make love change a man into a cuddly bear just because he falls in love. Not this time. The only compromise Kaleb makes is that instead of being the weapon of mass destruction that he planned, he becomes a weapon specially for his woman's use, and thankfully, she actually does have a conscience. So, he doesn't get to kill and torture quite as many as planned, but he still does. And his ultimate goal never changed. So we get to see the true Kaleb that we love to hate.<br /><br />On top of all that, we have a serious civil war going on, revenge to be had, an entire race (possibly the world) to take over, and sex that literally \\"makes the earth move\\" If you thought Judd had it rough with breaking furniture, you ain't seen nothing yet!<br /><br />My one and only complaint? I clicked purchase twice and bought two copie. No actually, I don't even care about paying double. It's worth every penny.don't even care about paying double. It's worth every penny.
B004DMIIUU|5.0|This 2009 film is among the most visually spectacular ever made. The picture compositions are thoroughly artistic, and the live and animated actions simply fantastic. The castings are also very charismatic, and the story tense and dramatic, heightened with some passionate epical music, making it altogether a captivating movie to watch from start to finish.<br /><br />Then again, it is largely a fantasy movie which uses some historic background to tell an epic story, surrounding the three famous Warlords who successively conquered Japan, and a legendary figure Goemon which has little factual basis. The story made Goemon adopted as a kid by the first conqueror Oda Nobunaga to be trained as a shinobi (ninja). However, when Lord Nobunaga was dead by betrayal in 1582, Goemon fled his castle to become eventually a thief widely applauded by the common folks like Robin Hood.<br /><br />The movie began 15 years after the death of Nobunaga, when Goemon uncovered accidentally a conspiracy during a theft, namely, Lord Hideyoshi who succeeded Nobunaga was actually one of the conspirators who betrayed him. A main story here is about Goemon's repeated actions to kill the Lord. His first try only killed Hideyoshi's decoy. His second attempt was to save his girlfriend from Hideyoshi primarily, but he aborted the assassination after some moral struggle.<br /><br />His third act was motivated by Hideyoshi's brutal murder of his shinobi friend Saizo. It is through Saizo's mouth that the film lashed out the heartfelt feelings of the people about the Warlords. Through the last words of Lord Hideyoshi the film also examined the motives of the one who sought absolute power. Historical sources said Toyotomi Hideyoshi did launch massive attacks into Korea in 1592 and 1597, but were driven back with China's forces before his death in 1598.<br /><br />A recurring message in the film concerns about the consequences of vengeance, particularly self-centered, rash actions against the authority powers. The film ended with Goemon slashing through armies to kill the ruthless lord Mitsunari, reaching a position to kill another lord Leyasu also. But Goemon refrained instead to beseech him to end the warrings so that people could live happily. Historians said Tokugawa Leyasu was the third Warlord who succeeded to unify Japan, to be followed by centuries of peace relatively.<br /><br />One can see that the themes are complex and serious : war and peace, brutality, betrayal, revenge, perseverance, love, friendship, ..... However, many storylines are unrealistic, and many scenes surreal, such as  cross-cultural architectures and costumes, and supernatural actions like video games. It is obvious the film is laden with symbolic meanings, and the entertainment factors are high, with many gorgeous designs and rich colors of intense tones and contrasts. Watching it in black and white gives one an impressive classical feel, especially when setting it in high contrast and a bit brighter.<br /><br />The fireflies depicted many times in the movie make me wonder if the director has watched the spectacular BBC series \\" Planet Earth \\" released internationally in 2007. The \\" Caves \\" episode has some scenes showing how the glowworms secreted silk threads to trap their preys. The ending theme song \\" Rosa \\" was performed by the band ' Violet UK ', which stands for ' Red (anger) & Blue (sadness) Underground Kingdom '. The producer Ichise is known for making many Horror films in Japan. Kiriya the director is finishing a third epic film said to be called \\" The Last Knights \\", starring Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|So I was lucky enough to get an early copy of Entwined with You because I attend Book Expo America on June 1, 2013. Sylvia Day was there signing copies to a long line of excited readers and I was lucky enough to be one of them!!!!<br />I started reading the book on Sunday evening and couldn't put it down. I took it work on Monday; read it on the train, during lunch and all my breaks, then stayed up all Monday night finishing the book. I am sooo exhausted but...it was totally worth it. I think this is the best book of the series.<br />Eva and Gideon and their emotional rollercoaster that is their relationship continue in Entwined With You.  I just truly love Eva and Gideon together. I truly feel their relationship as a couple evolves during this book. Eva and Gideon talk to each, share stories and secrets (and surprises, OMG the surprises). I feel they start to develop a stronger foundation for their relationship.<br />There are still outside factors conspiring against them and they continue to work their way through their relationship. But as a couple I think they are stronger then they have ever been. The book has all the hot steamy scenes that I have come to really enjoy about them. Gideon is his domineering self and I just so love that in him. He really cares for Eva and wants to take care of her.<br />Entwined with you is the perfect title for the book as it in my opinion represents their relationship. Eva and Gideon's lives are so entwined with each other that it's hard to find where one ends and the others stars.  But as crazy and extreme as their relationship has been, it works for them. They fit...their entwined.<br />There is no release date for book 4 in the series, but any date is still not soon enough.  Sylvia Day has delivered another fabulous book in the Crossfire series.

B00C3MK9ZO|5.0|It is both with honor and shame that I write the first review for this album.  It is an honor because I think that this band has evolved into the most prolific of progressive metal bands, and will eventually be recognized as one of the great bands of its time.  The shame of writing the first review is that the album has been out for a week now in the US, and two weeks internationally; how has no one written a review for this yet?  If this were a Metallica album, there would be 200 reviews by now I'm sure.  I guess I am one of the lucky ones who have stumbled upon this wonderful group of musicians.  On to the review:<br /><br />Coal is an album that strays fairly far away from their previous works.  One thing I love about this band is that all of their albums have completely different feels to them, with entirely different moods and style.  While they all are clearly melodic progressive metal albums, they definitely all feel unique.  For this very reason, I found that I initially wasn't fond of this album (I went through the same thing with Bilateral), because I think internally I wanted more of Tall Poppy Syndrome or Bilateral.  I loved those albums, and couldn't imagine anything different.  Leprous has decided to take a more stripped-down, slow-burning approach to their music this time around, and the result is magnificent.  After a few spins, this album grows on you, grabs you, and never lets go.  The subtle things become profound, the little nuances become brilliant, and the flow and feel of the album become so incredibly cohesive.  More than any other Leprous album, this one demands to be listened to all at once.  While there are many great individual songs, I feel that the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its parts in this case.  This album is dripping with emotion, feeling, sorrow, and just carries this melancholy energy throughout.  If you are not immediately blown away by what you hear, give it time to let it sink in - it is worth the time invested!<br /><br />I want to comment that while the instruments are more reserved than on previous works (what restraint that shows for a young band), they are still on-point the entire album, showing stellar musicianship and they play through some remarkably odd rhythms and time signatures.  The stand-out of the group on this album is definitely Einar Solberg though, the tremendous vocalist and synthesizer player.  His voice has evolved so much since TPS.  At first I thought he had a nice voice, being capable of doing a softer song like \\"Fate\\" and a death metal sort of song like \\"White.\\"  With Bilateral, I thought he took his voice to a new level, especially hitting me hard in the beautiful tracks \\"Acquired Taste\\" and \\"Mb. Indifferentia.\\"  There was a more soft side to him, yet the tone and timbre were simply perfect.  With this album though, Einar has solidified himself as one of the greatest metal vocalists of his time.  From the soft, delicate vocals of \\"The Cloak\\" to the grungy vocals in \\"Coal\\", he is all over the place on this album.  The opening ten seconds of the first track, \\"Foe\\", give you a great idea of his soaring vocals.  There are so many words to describe his performance on this album, yet none seem to do it justice: powerful, beautiful, emotive, etc.  Even when I don't know what words he's singing, the tone and timbre tell me everything I need to know to sense what he's singing about and what feeling he has while he's singing.  He's like an instrument of his own.<br /><br />This album is honestly more accessible than their prior ones are in my opinion because of the less harsh vocals, and also the more simple approach to songwriting that they employ here.  I think many new fans will jump on board if they hear this.  The song structures themselves, however, are quite odd.  Take the track \\"The Valley\\" as an example: the beginning starts normal, with an intro, first verse, and first chorus.  Then the band breaks into a long musical sections that builds and builds while the vocalist builds tension with his ethereal sounding voice.  By the time this ends and the chorus comes back in, you've almost forgotten what it sounded like the first time!  For a nine minute song, you'd be surprised to know that it only has a couple verses and a couple choruses (with the \\"bridge\\" sort of section after chorus 1).  The song \\"Echo\\" has a similarly odd structure, also spanning about 9 minutes (although this song I think is 30-60 seconds too long).  The final epic song of the album is \\"Contaminate Me,\\" which has a guest vocalist on it (Ishahn).  This song has an incredible intro, and really could fit on Tall Poppy Syndrome as well.  The only way I can describe this song is like this: dirty, disgusting, disturbing, and brilliant.  What a way to close an album.  Piano, violin, drums, and rabid screaming... these ingredients don't usually combine well, but Leprous pulls it off.  I initially was sort of put off by this song, but I've grown to love it for what it is and what it tries to do.  This is probably the heaviest song they've ever done, and it closes the album with a bang.  Speaking of heavy, those who want their Leprous to be hard and intense can look to songs like Coal and Chronic as well (it just occurred to me that all of their heavy songs start with the letter \\"C\\").  There are some aggressive vocals in those songs, and an overall metal vibe to them.  I particularly love Coal (ironically the first title track that I love - Bilateral and Tall Poppy Syndrome were both disappointing songs for me).  This song is comprised of two parts - the first section has a \\"straightforward\\" metal feel, and the last few minutes are an amazing close to this song, with some beautiful vocals sung over ferocious yelling (not like cookie-monster screaming a la Contaminate Me, but very angry yells).  The song fades with the words \\"into Coal\\" sung twice, with the instruments all cutting out the second time.  I really love every second of this song.<br /><br />For the softer side of Leprous, for fans of songs like \\"Fate\\", \\"Acquired Taste\\", or \\"Mb. Indifferentia\\", you will love \\"The Cloak\\", \\"Echo\\", and \\"Salt\\".  \\"Foe\\" also has a very soft ending, with some very tasteful harmonies towards the end.  The album, as a whole, is much softer than their prior works.  I think they have strayed further from their debut album with each album, and I think they've found a great place that can appease many different musical tastes while holding onto their original sound and metal roots.  They know when to put the heavy in for effect and emotion, but also can throw down a solid ballad when needed.  No matter what type of song, their are always great melodies and fantastic musicianship.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is probably the most complete album Leprous has ever made, with no wasted notes or tracks.  Everything has a purpose, and the album flows so well.  For a young band, they have already explored so many different types of metal and music in general, and I am truly excited to see what they do next.  Please do yourself a favor and get this album today if you have never heard them.  They are truly progressive, truly unique, and have a musical sense far beyond their years.  Thank you Leprous for breathing fresh air into the progressive metal scene.<br /><br />Album Rating: 10/10<br />Highlights: Coal, The Cloak, The Valley, Contaminate Me
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|What a great CD. This is a toe tapping, sing to the top of your lung, country, witty CD. I love the whole thing. Blake is so talented and I have most all of his albums, and I put this close to the top... I love it....
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|a lot better than most &quot;find&quot; game has a good story line and some puzzles even make you think.....best 1.50 ive spent so far

B0063IH60K|4.0|fun game but no extra shuffles like other solitaire games<br />and I seldom win but it is easier to play than other card games on my kindle.
B00008G8LN|5.0|If you had to have any 1980 flick in your collection, this one is it. I cannot stand Keanu, but this film is so well-done, I would call it a guilty pleasure all around. Thanks for speed and quality of the product.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|I always liked the anti-hero film, and it seems Clint deconstructs his western hero in this one. Still, a great replacement of my VHS copy..thanks!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|As soon as I started playing I told myself &#34;holy crap this game is fun&#34; great game to pick up and start upgrading!!!
0767812166|5.0|I just received and watched the film after not having seen it in years. It makes for an interesting contrast in perceptions of life on other planets and our world in general; in the 1980s when the economy was good, everyone seemed happy; these day, however, the economy sucks, nd now, it is all about War of the Worlds, annihilation of the earth by invaders, and alien abductions galore. In Starman, there is compassion and hope...oh,well.
1439102813|5.0|I love this book , its nice to read it , I love to see from the perception of the patient and how a disease can change the life of a person. its awesome writer and the book was like watching a movie.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Enjoyed reading the book. It has good lessons on building character during uncertain times while providing hope in adversarial situations.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|so I installed it and yeah, I like it.  I can actually tag people directly in the comments.  except now its stuck in limbo-land.  the Icon just takes me to he app description and when I click open, it doesn't do anything.  I also cant uninstall the app.......  great.....
0920668364|5.0|I first bought this book about 25 years ago after hearing my children's grammar school principal read it. Now I buy a copy for a new baby present. It always brings tears to the eyes of someone!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so excited about the release of this book, and preordered it for my Kindle.  Today, I checked reviews before reading and was shocked to see how bad the reviews are.  Then to discover the author changed the trilogy to a 5 book series.  No!I don't think so!  It also appears that the storyline is being stretched and being dragged out thereby changing the whole feel of the characters and book.<br /><br />This is the first book I have ever returned for a refund.  I am not going to waste my time reading a book that was supposed to be the promised conclusion; then ends up being a cliffhanger; and then makes the readers have to wait at least a year for the conclusion.  Ridiculous! There are too many other books out there published by talented authors who provide what they promise to their readers.<br /><br />I'm extremely disappointed in this turn of events, and am not even sure if I will re-purchase this book once the remaining 2 books are released. Sometimes less is better, and I am afraid that is the case with this series.
159562015X|5.0|Great book bought one for niece and buying one for my son all college age student. On time in great condition.
B005XLN97M|5.0|My two little ones still play with their Barbie Beach house. Very versitiale and durable. This home is perfect if you don't have the room for the Barbie three story townhome.
B009R659L8|5.0|It has now become a tradition with me; the new Mary Higgins Clark book becomes a Mother's Day/ End of School/Birthday gift I give myself.  I admit there have been a few in the last few years that didn't quite hit me with the same sense of awe as the first books I had read, but now along comes Daddy's Gone a Hunting and I find myself digging in to solve the mystery yet again.  I found this book compelling. MHC gives us all the puzzle pieces and then leads the reader through assembling the puzzle.  Only reading a book like this could get me through 48 hours of a nasty stomach virus when I found it hard to think about anything.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|My friends and I have been waiting 6 long months for the final book in this TRILOGYYYY, only to find out that there's going to be a part 4 & 5!!!! SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?! So disappointing that Sylvia Day has now officially ruined one of the best love stories, only to get more money out of this. I hope everyone returns this book, so her strategy backfires.  She could of ended Gideon and Eva's love story, and then done spin offs for the other characters. I would have been more interested to read about the other characters separately. I have never written a review before but made sure to take the time to do it for this book.  SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Hope Sylvia Day realizes how badly she messed up with this book. Everyone needs to return this book for their money back, biggest waste of $10.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is my second Lifeproof case.  The first one lasted a full 2 years and then the 'door' that you flip open to gain access to the charging port cracked.  After another 2 months it gave up the ghost and fell off.  BUT...that case had been to the beach, the pool, in below freezing weather, in the rain, exposed to all sorts of drops and dings and it worked like a champ.  I loved it so much I replaced it with the exact same case.  My only complaint is the little screw on cap that is used to keep it waterproof when not using the headphones.  There is no where to put it!! I don't always carry the headphone adapter with me, so it needs to have a place on the actual case to store it when using the headphones.  Great product overall.  I highly recommend it even with that one flaw.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|So I've been waiting for this book since Kaleb discovered the star charm. It has been such a hard wait. The book definately brought some loose ends together and tho many of the revelations weren't too unexpected it was still suprising. I love that the heroine in this book is so strong, not just mentally like many Psy but emotionally too. I felt such awe for her for keeping Kaleb on the side of good and how much love she has for him. It was beautiful. I have loved all of the heroines and heroes in this series but I must say my favorites are the ones who have to work harder at being \\"good\\" and Kaleb certainly fits. I would definately recommend reading the other books in the series before you read this one as a lot of the characters in the other books are tied into this one.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|We all owe a debt of gratitude for men like Chris Kyle. He says it how it is, without ego. Sometimes violence does solve problems.
B00BM1AJIO|3.0|Really disappointed that the first game I spend five bucks on is so short. Great graphics though &amp; good story line.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun and teaches patience especially if u don't want to spend money just play a little and come back paternal
B003ELY7PG|2.0|The autor uses a kind of logic that is, in my opinion, very flaude. He says things like \\"I eat 5 hamburgers per day and don´t have high colestorol, thus I conclude that hamburgers do not cause high colesterol\\".<br /><br />They are constantly saying the \\"truth\\" without any real objectivity, saying it works because they made it work and that is a really poor argument.<br /><br />I understand not all books can be based on research, in fact I love many business books that are based on experience. But most of the autors that write books based on experience say things like \\"Have you tried this? It has work very well for me\\". This way you know what they are saying is a possible thing to do, and give you ideas of what you can try.<br /><br />They say things like \\"who needs a PR agency? we wore featured in this and that paper without one, why would you pay tens of thousends of dollars for PR that you dont need?\\"<br /><br />First of all, not al PR agencies will cost you tens of thousends. Secondly, how long did it take them to get into this big news outlet? Do they know how long it would have taken them with a PR agency? Would it be better? And thirdly their most sucessful product (Basecamp, which I am a user) is a project management tool where you pay by project, not by user. This makes it really easy to invite suppliers to participate on your project page without any extra cost. They supplier sees how it works for us and might sign up for it themselves. This is ofcourse a genious move, and makes the product viral (like dropbox, that gives you extra space for each person you invite) but not all products can work the same, or not al entrepreneurs can find such a clever way to make your product or service viral.<br /><br />At one point they say \\"People say to learn from your mistakes, but what can you learn from your mistakes, we learn from our sucesses\\" \\"Other people´s mistakes are their mistakes, not yours, so don´t get mixed up on it\\". I am an internet business owner andso far I have never met a person that has not made a mistake. If you do make a mistake, you better learn not to do it again, and WHY it was a mistake. If you don´t learn that, then I think it will be hard to move forward.<br /><br />I have read many business books, almost 1 per week and this is the lowest rating I have ever given as I recall. It has no new and usefull information, its just a recopilation of statments, some of which I agree fully, so of which I dont agree at all.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My family loves this game. I started this game a few months ago and then got my family addicted. Uncle had over 8000 coins just a day ago and sister and I are close behind with over7000.  What I hope to see is more puzzles in the future. Is that going to be?
B008CP6RWU|5.0|recently, the ny museum of modern art acquired Flow as a part of their collection, and in my opinion, Flow is the least of these games. none of these games are explained with words, just visuals and it makes it difficult at times to try and figure out what you're trying to accomplish. the ending to flower was a bit of a disappointment, i'm not going to lie, but the rest of the game was amazing. journey on the other hand, i have one and only one complaint about: IT'S TOO SHORT. words can't even describe how beautiful an breath taking this game is, and the ending, while at first glimpse made me sad and hopeless turned out to be one of my favorite video game endings of all time. it has me coming back again and again in hopes that maybe something will be different, maybe i can get my cape longer, maybe, just maybe, i'll make it this time. and in truth, that's what the game is about, the journey, not the end.<br />buy it. play it.<br />we are in the presence of something we cannot even begin to fathom here, much less describe; even the creators didn't try to muddle up your own interpretation with words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its like temple run but more fun and its better and makes me more excited about new missions
B0036TGT3E|5.0|A wonderful classic movie. I had to purchase it before it went into the Disney vault so I could share with my nephews. hakuna matata
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle's original cord stopped charging my  kindle, and I ordered this after talking to a nice lady in customer service. Works great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. I couldn't tell you how many times this book made me cry, but I wouldn't be able to tell you how many times it made me smile either. I absolutely loved it!
0425263924|1.0|I loved book 1 and 2. I waited so long for this book which initially promised to be released last December,  But seeing all the negative reviews I decided ditching  book 3. Why promised Trilogy if it won't be? I know the answer GREED!! You know Ms Day I work too and damn I'm a hard worker. I make sure that my  5 star service worth every penny my clients paid and leave them happy at the end of the day. So prolonging the ending just to cash in more dough lost my respect in you.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Im still currently watching the show for the first time.  Im on season 3 now.  Im really diggin this show now.  I wouldnt saying Im a big superman fan but I might call myself one after I watch this show.  I like the characters, I really like Lex Luthor on this because Michael Rosenbaum plays him perfect.  He's right on the line of being good or bad.  The effects are good and some of the action is too.  I like how the story is unfolding about Clark.  Its getting suspenseful because some characters are on the verge of finding out about Clark.  So far I give this show a 8 or 9 out of 10 but I still got a lot more to watch.  I think the set is very nice.  I like the box and the two books with all the beautiful pics.  It was in perfect condition.  The only reason Im giving it a 4.5 is because of how the discs are packaged. There are a lot of reviews talking about this and I agree.  It wasnt that hard to get them out but I would say not to put them back in because the discs does get scratched.  I bought a cd case to hold all the discs, besides that I think this is a really nice set.  I do hope a full series set does come out on blu ray sometime soon, but thise will do for now.  Im very happy with it.
0545265355|5.0|I bought the trilogy for my older grandchildren and husband to read during the hot summer months  My husband has already started

B00C33M2EE|5.0|Piano guys has done it again!!!!!! I'm so glad I got the deluxe edition with the DVD. My grandson loves to watch it and dance to the music.  I just love to watch it and listen to your inspiring music.  Keep it coming!!!!!
B0095G5AFU|2.0|I thought I would be able to create entries in a notebook with entry titles. If there is a way to do this, there's no info or help on how to do this. I wanted to manage my info to create a way to get at the notes instead of having just pages of info in that I would need to scroll down. Note books should be organized, but I can't see that it is. Help on the app is no help. I would not recommend this at all and wish I had just got a free note pad instead.
3899554698|4.0|Very original, but I was also expecting maps created by painters and short narratives by relevant authors which in some way or other have to do with maps. Neverthless, I would recommend this book to friends who are fascinated by  cartography and voyages.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria is just the way I remember it all those years ago on MTV! Thank goodness for being able to preserve things on DVD!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book left me wanting more!  I can't wait for book 4 to see how Gideon and Eva grow! Gideon is hot. The only down side is the cliffhanger  Hope I don't have to wait too long
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Waited way too long for this book, then to find out there will be two more books!  I loved the first two books, this one was dissapointing.  Eva is portrayed as selfish, not worthy of Gideon in this book. For god's sake, he murdered for her and still they don't have a &#34;Happy Ever After&#34; yet.  Not sure I will continue with the series now.  This book should have wrapped it up.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Large selection of sounds. Seamless looping. High quality all around. Haven't had trouble falling asleep since I got it. Turned a few family and friends on to it. Love it!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|so touching... an inspiring story that reminds us of the importance of believing in and pursuing a creative dream without losing yourself
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was the first G5 game I've played and I'll definitely be playing more!<br />It was entertaining and interesting and I recommend trying it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|So addictive. I played the free version for a long time, and it's so refreshing to not have to deal with  ads anymore. On top of the lack of ads, there are a substantial amount of new levels.
0345529057|5.0|A must read for anyone intersted in fantasy. if you liked lord of the rings or HP this is a great series for you. Beware of the nudity/sex/violence. also your favorite charecters will probably die. very well written.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|At first I was skeptical about &#34;UK Editions&#34; but no problem since my DvD player is only months old. I enjoyed every minute of these three DvDs & couldn't wait for Season 4.
0316228532|4.0|This book may fall a little flat on American audiences, so all reviews by US readers need to be looked at a bit carefully to be certain they do not criticize this book for it's extremely English world view.<br /><br />The book is heavly character driven, Rowling is extremely good at developing characters. She weaves the world, and the interrelationships between the ?34 characters in a skillful way. The book, I believe, is a very detailied, sore, dirty look at who we really are as human beings.<br /><br />The story is not an action packed light read. To appreciate the plot you must slowly get to know the characters and their world and watch how they move the plot forward in a mess of emotions, hurts, failed lives and attempts to control their own little worlds.<br /><br />What is so amazing about this book, if you give it the time it needs, is that every character presents themselves as they see themselves, but then you flip point of view to see them from the perspective of others they interact with and suddenly a virtue is now the bane of someone else's life. What might be a cursed person as seen by one chartacter, may be seen by someone else as a heroic attempts at being good and a great effort rise above their burdened lives..<br /><br />This story reminds me of the film Magnolia, with Tom Cruise. You must have patience, and the story teaches more than most books about what it is truly like to be human.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love Kate Morton's other novels so I was a bit surprised I wasn't loving this one immediately. My advice: stick with it... after the part titled Vivien, I couldn't put it down. This is one of her best endings.  Don't give  up on Dolly, Jimmy, and Vivien!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I feel like this book was just a filler, for the next book. After all the delay in releasing it, it had no hype. They had sex all the time, yipee, where did the story go? I feel like there was no really high point to it, just a bunch of low key scenarios that made for a very boring book. Definitely not as good as the other two!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome check it out and its really fun it's one of the best games you will ever play and I mean it check it out
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|People seem to have mixed feelings after seeing this movie and down-score it due to the fact that is not 'happy' enough and that the characters are unlikable. I believe that in fact this is the writer and director's breakthrough. Real people are like that , sometimes nice and with qualities , sometimes they shout and swear and they are wrong.The relationships are more stress and fights rather than good moments.<br /><br />Aptow managed to show all these many and complex aspects of nowadays society: the pressure on looking good, the obsession about getting older, the way people ended up in financial problems, precisely because they were buying things they could not really afford or need, the 'second' life when you have kids when you are much older, the technology infiltration everywhere,the stressful balancing of different roles at home and at work and the list is never ending. And he presents all these with a humorous detachment from them.The dialogues are witty ,critical and with a lot of references to modern culture. People out there can actually identify with some of these characters and their issues.It's taking a step back and looking at ourselves.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Our package arrived a month late. When we finally got it the packaging for Star Trek: The Next Generation was completely wrecked. First off it looked like a cheap pirated copy. The cases for the actual DVDs were, I kid you not, held together by tape. The plastic packaging that was the &#34;box&#34; was nothing more than that cheap cellophane packaging Barbie boxes are made of and there were scratch marks all over it. This gets one star only because no stars is not an option. This item is getting returned for sure! Save yourselves some time and money and don't even bother!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|So disgraceful for it to have been that long for an update. This goes to show that buying EA games from Amazon isn't worth the money.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is amazing , worth downloading &amp; a great way to pas  the time<br />  I recommend to any &amp; everybody that love to play something challenging
B00180R06I|5.0|This is a gorgious transfer of an important film of the Wiemar days. And of course being that its Criterion its got everything a film fanatic could want. This is for Amazon...PLEASE REMOVE REVIEWS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS PRODUCT! The shifting of film reviews from earlier inferior vhs or dvd copies where the quality rated 1 star, to realeases such as The Criterion Collection is inexcusable!
0399226907|5.0|everything was in perfect condition---the price was great and the shipping was fast and not expensive--grand daughter satisfied and that's all that counts
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was a very helpful and mind altering book.  I would put this in my \\"life changing\\" books category.  It was an attention grabbing read from the beginning.  I literally sat and read the whole book in one night I could not put it down.  A must read!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Despite the picture being geared toward little kids, this game is not for kids under 5. It is much too complicated and requires reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My boyfriend and I love this app. He has it on his iPhone and I have it on my kindle.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This fourth shark game has better graphics, cooler concept, and the same great gameplay. I, as a customer plead for an evo 2. Plz read this review and download this game that is worth your time.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Difficult to see the picture well on the tile. I had no trouble playing though and I liked the shuffle feature and the various layouts.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|So the bad in this book is the sucky ending. It is was too fast or abrupt an ending. I thought my iPad was messing up because it just should not have ended there.<br />But I do think this one was better than book 2. I think the super hot chemistry was back and you just felt the desire. I also enjoyed watching them grow as people during all this craziness. But good golly Sylvia can write some sizzle!<br />I have really enjoyed these damaged characters but I think Sylvia should have focused on books about the other supporting cast rather than drag this out into more books.<br />Also - spoiler alert - thank you for not having her get knocked up. I'm sure that is the next book, but thankful for them being married first.<br />If you liked book 1 and know to expect an ending you won't love, you will really enjoy this book!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old loves this. She practices writing some letters and likes to change the colors. Easy for her to use.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. Cannot wait for the next one. Gideon has done the utmost to protect the only woman he's ever loved. He killed the man who raped her as a child and who was planning to kill her. No matter how much it hurt the both of them he pushed her away to protect her from Nathan. Gideon finally told her he loved her with spoken words in the .  But His actions to protect her always showed his love. It just took Eva learning the truth to see it. Great book!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|First of all, my biggest pet peeve. A lot of people complain about Spock showing too much emotion in the new movies. Does anyone remember that his mother died in front of him and that his entire planet was destroyed? The character is still young, immature, and malleable. Watch Spock in The Original Series. He displays smugness, superiority, touches of humor, annoyance, and so on. He's not a robot. Vulcans have emotions as strong, or stronger than, humans. They use logic to control them. But I'm guessing losing your planet and mother might allow cracks to show. Additionally, the last two movies take place BEFORE the original series, and if you look at Spock in \\"The Cage\\" - the first pilot which took place before Kirk took over, Nimoy's Spock was much more emotional - possibly even more than Quinto's Spock. Yes, that was because the character itself changed in concept, but one could also view the character as a rebel who left Vulcan - partly due to his emotional responses, and over time tried to become more and more Vulcan than human.  Nimoy's Spock was able to do this because there wasn't a huge emotional event in his life to the extent that occurred for Quinto's Spock.<br /><br />Ok, pet peeve rant done.  This was a solid movie.  I was actually afraid there would be more action than there was, and while it was pretty action packed - there were moments of quiet and character development interspersed.  There were a lot of shout outs to The Wrath of Khan, but I think the movie made sense in using them.  Perhaps there were a few too many... bringing Carol Marcus in for instance, but overall I thought it worked.  Regarding Carol Marcus, people complain that she's supposed to be a molecular biologist not a weapon's tech.  Her father (and the Federation in general) was obviously affected by the events from the first movie, and probably became much more focused on military action than he would have been without Nero's arrival.  He could easily have influenced her decision of which areas of science to enter.  Still, she was the weakest link in the movie.<br /><br />The characters were just as perfectly acted this time around as before, and everyone had something to do - if only for a moment.  It was an action movie, but Abrams managed to throw more character development and true feeling emotion into scenes than many directors can do with a lot more slow scenes (Iron Man 3 for instance).<br /><br />I rate Star Trek II, First Contact, and maybe Star Trek VI above this one, but those were all great Science Fiction movies that just happened to be Star Trek movies too.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros: I love the way the mouse functions. It fits both my small hands and my boyfriend's large hands comfortably. In addition the software provides me with a flexible atmosphere to fine tune my mouse.<br /><br />Cons: The only thing I don't like about this mouse is cosmetic. One of the features of this mouse is that you can change the color of the lights. What I didn't realize is that only the light behind the anchor changes; the lighting at the front of the mouse remains (sadly) blue. I find this especially unfortunate because when I'm using the mouse the only lights that are visible are the ones on the front. Definitely not a deal breaker, but it would be nice to see this changed in any future mice they manufacture.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Sad story. But a good book. I, like I'm sure many others, had no idea these camps existed. Well written as told in sometimes first,person.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|The case is very heavy after you put the Kindle in it, it makes carrying it in your purse or around the house very difficult.  If by some chance you want to take the Kindle out of the case, you darn near break the Kindle it is that hard getting it out.<br /><br />I used it for about three (3) weeks and then went back to the original case.  I put this one on the shelf, don't know if I will use it again or not.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book.  I fought reading the series, because I thought it would be too &#34;sci-fi&#34; for me, but it is a great story.  This one continues the saga of Katniss, Gale, and Peeta.  I did a lot of gasping!  Loved it!

B009I2UH2W|5.0|Iphone 5 uses the lightning connection which is hard to find at the moment. I bought a cheaper charger which kept popping out of phone. Griffin charger is heavey duty, charges fast, and stays in phone. Price is great as well. I've seen stores that want $35-50 for a lightning charger charger.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a great way to learn history. This true story kept me reading at every opportunity. Exciting combat and poignant camaraderie filled the pages. At times my heart raced and at other times I was brought to tears. I Highly recommend this book
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this on Ipad then had to have it for the nook it is worth the money but you'll spend too many hours trying to beat it.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I have changed this review from 3 stars to 1.   I'm 2 years strong in dealing with withings. After year one my original purchase died. They replaced it free of charge because I was one week short of the warranty expiring. That made me happy that they stood behind the product and assured me this isn't typical of their product.   1 year 1 month later the battery inside the unit exploded and the unit itself will no longer turn on. Because I am 1 month past the warranty now they are offering me a 25% discount to buy a new one. They said it's normal for their batteries to swell but not explode. I told them to keep the discount I'll buy another unit from a different brand at full price. I'm not risking a leaky battery on my baby or future babies. Their customer service is much to be desired. I'm done with WITHINGS.     Original review: Ok let me start off by saying that I really liked this monitor at first. I hate buyers remorse and would have talked myself out of most issues.  I have 2 HTC Thunderbolts (Android 4.0.4) with which I side loaded this app onto because it wasn't &#34;compatible&#34;. I also own the KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 which I downloaded the app from the Amazon app store being that it was actually compatible.  With the FIRE HD 8.9 on wifi only I was able to use the microphone, check the temp/humidity, be alerted of too much noise or motion, play a lullaby and turn on the night light. I could also control the volume of the lullaby as well and change the song. The issue was that after about 4 hours or so the app would just turn off. If i was around for that event i could easily just click the app and it was back on again. However, in the middle of the night you dont realize the app turned off. Being unsure if this was a problem with the app, hardware of the monitor, or the Kindle Fire, i decided to try side loading the apps onto our smartphones and try with those.  With side loading the app onto our HTC thunderbolts that were supposably incompatible i was able todo everything i was able to do on the FIRE HD. Pleased with that I hoped that I would be able to have this on all night as well. Nope about four hours into it, it to would just turn off. Again not sure if it was the app, the smartphones, or the monitor itself and then possibly my wifi network connection. I decided to view the app remotely and see if i could rule out the network connection. Complete access even remotely was nice but it did seem again that after so many hours it would just randomly turn off.  I contacted customer support with all the information i provided above and asked for their help. They were awesome about trouble shooting and giving me suggestions. Suggestion 1: Turn the smartphone or tablet completely off resetting the ram memory and then try running the app all night. Result: Fail. Suggestion 2: Rule out the hardware issue of the Baby Monitor: Try with an apple product. If the Apple product is able to run all night then its an Android problem. If it fails as well it is either a network problem or the baby monitor itself.   I got ahold of an iTouch 4th generation(running on iOS 6). An iTouch is alot cheaper and easier to get (without contracts and such so I could return it easily as well). I ran the iTouch all night on the wifi network of my house and it worked flawlessly. Never turned off. And even when it had an interruption in the connection, it reconnected itself and didnt just turn the app off like the Androids i own did.  So customer service resolved the issue as far as what was the weak link. However, I was extremely displeased with the fact that they did nothing to help me with an Android problem with which was the issue. So I spent $250 on this monitor and another $180 on an iTouch with which all that money I could have bought a wireless security camera with all the bells and whistles for that money. I would have lost a few baby friendly features but over all the monitoring would have been the same.  Bottom line: If you own an apple product this will work for you flawlessly. If you own android only products like I did, contact people who have the same android model as you and software and see if they had an issue. I can tell you from my experience the KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 and the HTC THUNDERBOLTS did NOT work flawlessly. If you insist on buying this product and still have android only products i suggest buying an iTouch if you are not planning on buying an iPad or iPhone anytime soon. The iTouch can do everything an iPhone can do with some limitations (like making a Tower call or using 3g/4g) but for wifi purposes it can do all the same things for the most part at a much cheaper price.
B005HSL626|5.0|Got this for my nook tablet and it is just like the ipad version and pc version the action is great spent way too many hours playing this.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I checked the weather and it said 85 and real feel was 85.when I went outside it felt like 60. otherwise it is a great app.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|There was an update to this game, not sure when it went through.  But you now have to purchase some levels.  When you didn't have to before.  I understand in-app purchases are necessary for developers to continue their work.  But these levels were available before, so they should have stayed that way.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was the best book series I have ever read!  I loved the characters and even the fifty shades was edible.  So glad I got the trilogy since once I started I couldn't put it down.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun app. only problem, it freezes from time to time. Other than that, best free app u could get. Playing as Iron Man is always fun
0316247545|5.0|I have a 10 year old who is IN LOVE with MLP and all it's fables. She loves to read up on each character and know all she can know about the episodes. I was over the moon when I saw this was coming soon and now that it is here, I know she will be thrilled to receive it for her birthday.<br /><br />It is smaller than I anticipated, measuring only 8.5 x 6 inches. It is more of a handbook than a picture book, which is great by me! The colorful part of the image is a shiny dust jacket.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this is the most enjoyable game I have played! So I think that every one should give this game a try.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Look, do yourself a favor, jump to chapter 4. It becomes a readable book then. The parts before that are filled with stuff that will have you nodding after three or four pages. Seriously people it doesn't get interesting AT ALL... AT ALL(see how I just did that with the big letters there? That was so you'd pay attention), until chapter 4.<br /><br />Once that happens, you get fully emersed in the story and it gets better from there. Seriously, you can read the first pages to grab a slight understanding of the main characters name, maybe go forward a little bit to understand who Lisbeth is, but I did all of the hard work for you here people. You can take my advice. I'm a pretty good guy.<br /><br />Final review: It's a 1 star book until chapter 4 where it becomes a 4 star book. Therefore I give it a 3 star rating.
B008JOLG7U|3.0|Some of the dance tracks were good the others kinda put me to sleep. If I have to fast forward through a song then unfortunately the whole album gets a thumbs down.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I just love this game. It's so relaxing, peaceful and it doesn't take long time to play on a tablet.
B00AHXIC50|2.0|The entire album was a bore. There is only one track I listen to and only because it is reminiscent of the Police. Otherwise complete and utter yawn.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Now this is definitely one game that's getting a lot of use. A simple game that is definitely good to train someone on how to use a tablet to begin with and have fun.
B0014LX420|1.0|Seriously what the hell was I thinking? I think there was only 1 song on this entire album I didn't fast forward through. Too bad I couldn't return it back in to the cloud.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Cute game that reminds me how much fun I used to have with the original. Unfortunately, I think I'm not as fast as I used to be.
075669812X|4.0|My son, a kindergartener, and all his friends love this book. They enjoy learning about all the characters (more detail beyond the books) and are able to apply that knowledge to their play -- making more rich and creative story lines on their own incorporating things they have learned from the book. In fact, after my son got this, about 5 of his friends asked their parents to get it for them. This would make a very cool gift for a 5 or 6 year old boy. It comes with Lloyd, the green ninja figurine, which they all seem to love. Beware, because it outlines in great detail what each Ninjago lego set comes with, you may find your child's birthday and holiday wish lists are very long and include a number of expensive Ninjago Lego sets!<br /><br />The only criticism I have is probably one of Amazon, but this product took more than a month to receive. This has happened to us with a number of toys we have ordered through Amazon recently. We ordered this as a Valentines' Day gift for our son but it arrived weeks late. I'm not sure if this is just something that happens when you select free shipping but I have noticed it being more of an issue in the past year with toys in particular.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Awesome! Gone are the days of lugging out the too big, too huge, too heavy, too old dictionary. No more flipping through pages either.

B008KYOCA2|5.0|I can see myself utilizing this more and more in the future. Easy to use and right at my fingertips.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book proves how much percy loves annabeth she is the only person percy remembers from his past sense hera stole his memory. This book is the start for some new characters like Hazle Frank and Reyna  from camp Jupiter .  These three characters are really cool. Like how hazel was brought back up from the underworld. And how Frank's life depends on a small piece of firewood. Also how Reyna gives people second chances. That is why I think the son of Neptune is a great book to read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Now this is a fun app and it's so much better than having a one-tone type of alarm clock that you can't change or alter in any way.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was fun and challenging. A good way to exercise your brain. If you love problem solving, you will love this game.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Refreshing to see well scripted drama, well developed characters and storyline all at the same time. The few 180 degree turns were not  enough to put me off and come back in from left field.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Enjoyed an &#34;Arnold&#34; film with action and laughs combined.  Great by play with the other cast members.  Good weekend movie to relax and be entertained.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I've read the entire series and was really looking forward to this last book. I wasn't impressed and found myself waiting and waiting for the good part that never came.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a very good book.  It was hard to put down after I started  to read.  It wasn't quite what I thought  it  was going to be.  It was quite a different  than some of the other books that I have read in the past,
B009NY43NY|1.0|All you have to do is read all of the negative reviews to get an idea of how terrible this final installment of the Sookie Stackhouse series truly is. It was as if Charlaine Harris wasn't even trying in this outing. Actually, she hasn't been for the last couple of books, but for the final book, some effort would've been nice.<br />The characters were uninteresting and it felt like the story never got started...even at the end. The plot was weak and there was too much filler time dedicated to Sookie's daily activities rather than events to move the story along. And the ending? God awful! Unfinished and inexplicable.<br />It seems as if Harris was only completing a contract obligation with no regard to finishing a beloved series with any sentiment. Shame!

0807014273|5.0|Great book with an inspiring message.  So many people spend their lives with a \\"woe is me\\" attitude, or waste years trying to \\"find themselves\\".  This book shows us the bigger picture, and how to find meaning in your life.  Nuff said.  I really enjoyed the message, and the story of survival in German death camps during World War 2 is something that no human these days can comprehend.  Awe inspiring.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. Couldn't wait for this to come out to Netflix so had to purchase it. Can't beat the easy purchase and instant delivery!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|It fits the phone really well, and shows off the sticker I have on the back.  It is a nice mix of bendy and sturdy so it is easy to put on the phone while actually providing protection.  The front sticks out a bit to protect the screen from phone face plants, and none of the buttons are impeded.  Great design.  Great price.  I am very happy with it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Now I have all four seasons of this incredible TV Show - have never been so addicted to a series as I am to &#34;Castle&#34;- believe I may be seriously in need of a &#34;12 step program&#34;!!!! The chemistry between all of the cast members is great - the humor and the way they care and support each other in a dangerous field ,is wonderful to see. There are only eight main cast members, but one really feels as if you know them personally. Of course the romance between Detective Kate Becket and Writer, Richard Castle has had all loyal viewers biting our nails down to &#34;nubs&#34; throughout the series - will they admit to their feelings or not? And now the Writers have left us all with a true &#34;cliff hanger&#34; as Season Four came to an end. Cannot wait for Season Five.!! Meanwhile I watch my own copies over and over.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|What a way to start a new adventure; an alternate universe. Can't wait to see what happens next.  Just loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just discovered this author and he is absolutely amazing!  One of his other novels, &#34;Half Way Home&#34; was on Amazon's Kindle Deals for May, sounded interesting, good price, why not?  I seriously stayed up all night reading it.  When I picked my jaw up off the floor from reading that one, I looked up more of his work and found this great Kindle deal on the &#34;Wool&#34; series.  This one took a bit longer than a night, but I still managed it in a few days.  Love story, political intrigue, murder mystery, post apocalyptic survival, and other subtleties I'm not remembering at the moment.  It truly emphasizes that conflict is not always black and white, but gray and a different shade of gray.  Even the &#34;bad guy&#34;, rat bastard that I was loving to hate, has his reasons for doing what he does and they're not completely ludicrous.  While the story and narrative is amazing, it's the characters that are truly genius.  Each one is truly an individual with their own quirks and personality, even the ones that make a brief showing with one line of dialogue have depth.  I'm excited to read more!
1781162646|5.0|Devin Jones is in love with his girlfriend, Wendy. Although lately it seems to be one sided. Wendy goes off with a friend and leaves Devin. You want to know when you can tell that your relationship has gone sour...when all you receive is the occasional postcard that only has about two lines and one of the lines is written by your girlfriend's friend.<br /><br />Devin gets a job working at the carnival, Joyland. Working at the carnival takes his mind off Wendy. Well that and a murder at the carnival. Where people have seen the ghost haunting the haunted house.<br /><br />I have read a handful of books by Mr. King, so I would not call myself an uber fan. However I am familiar with his books and the ones that have been turned into movies. I wonder what goes on in the mind of someone like Mr. King. Probably things like his latest book Joyland.<br /><br />To be honest the first thing that caught my eye and made me want to read this book was the awesome book cover. Big kudos to the art department. The cover reminded me of the old Nancy Drew books I read. Of course the other bonus to wanting to read this book is that it sounded really good and it is written by Mr. King.<br /><br />Well I can tell you that this book is everything that I hoped it would be. If you can never read a Stephen King book, you are a fan, or you are just getting back into his books then you have to run to your local bookstore and pick up a copy for yourself and maybe one more copy to share with a friend. Joyland is a joy to read. It will have you wanting to go to the carnival and having you falling in love with Mr. King again.

B0042FZWC0|5.0|Chris shows some excellent ideas and examples on this book(some of them totally new and inspirational for me), I loved it. If you, like me, is kind of tired about the way your life is taking and are looking for a way to change it for living a more passionate and awesome life probably this book will be a good reading for you(and Chris's blog too). On my case I love my actual work but its not exactly what I want for the future, I want to travel the world and create things, relevant and helpful things, and I hate my engineering college. This book it's the kind of support I was looking for: it made me believe a little more that its possible and that I should try, if something goes wrong I can just come back and try a new thing again. Definitely I recommend the reading.

B00847KFDS|5.0|When I saw this album, it made me drool.  This is what I've been imagining for years now.  John Fogerty is still the musician he always was, but I felt like his songs can always evolve into other levels of sound: Keith Urban playing banjo on \\"Almost Saturday Night\\" for instance.<br /><br />My only \\"complaint\\" is that the choices of musicians are oriented towards a folk/country sound, which doesn't do justice to Fogerty.  Dave Grohl and Tom Morello help indicate that Fogerty's sound cannot be labeled as \\"country\\" \\"swamp rock\\" or \\"southern rock.\\"  Certainly, Fogerty's influence does appear in southern rock...<br /><br />But...<br /><br />On one hand, Fogerty's sound was roots rock, southern rock/hair metal, heartland rock, arena/glam rock, alt country, and new country.  On the other hand, his sound foreshadowed and influenced punk, noise, lo-fi, grunge, alt rock, and nu metal.  \\"Fortunate Son\\" is arguably the first and most complete song of anarcho-punk that the Sex Pistols played in the late 70s.  There are also elements of Goth rock, funk-punk, and new wave.  To boot, many of Fogerty's songs have been covered or sampled by blues, funk, disco, reggae, and hip hop musicians.<br /><br />Kurt Cobain once said that he wanted to have the respect of John Lennon and the anonymity of Ringo Starr ... which basically describes Fogerty in a nutshell.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the inclusion of other guitarists like, Jack White, Eddie van Halen, East Bay Ray, J Mascias of Dinosaur Jr, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth on guitar; Mark McGrath, Beck, Jonathan Davis, Billy Corgan, Gerard Way, Eddie Vedder, Allison Krauss, Patti Smith, and Rob Thomas on vocals; or a collaboration with Gym Class Heroes or The Black Keys.<br /><br />Songs that I think should have been revisioned:<br />Down on the Corner (with Gym Class Heroes)<br />Run Through the Jungle (with Eddie Vedder and J Mascias)<br />Tombstone Shadow (with Jack White and Billy Corgan)<br />Porterville (with The Black Keys)<br />Lookin' Out My Back Door (remixed version with Beck)<br />Green River (bluegrass version with Allison Krauss)<br />Sinister Purpose (with Gerard Way and Thurston Moore)<br />Penthouse Pauper (remixed with Jonathan Davis)<br />Hey Tonight (with Mark McGrath)<br />The Old Man is Down the Road (with Dwight Yoakam)<br />Sweet Hitchhiker (with Patti Smith)<br />Up around the Bend (with Rob Thomas and Eddie van Halen)<br />Commotion (with East Bay Ray)

B00514HDNW|5.0|it's hard for me to find books that keep my interest in the opening chapters. a friend recommended Richard Matheson and I am legend was my first choice because I enjoyed how well the movie was put together overall. I'm only ten chapters into the book, I wish I would have read the book first.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|In reading this book I felt as if I was right there with Patti Smith. I read this book for a book club so I was very surprised at how great it was.  Patti Smith bought you on a journey that you are all the better for going along. You really get to see a side of New York that no longer exist. This book was a look at a time that people could be true artists and there was a community that supported them and not tried to confirm them.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Be aware of fake s<br />I love PS3 controllers, but when buying them on line you better make sure you are getting the genuine ones. I just tried buying 2 genuine used like new PS3 controllers from a seller fulfilled by Amazon (Infutech Inc) and I got cheap copies. It is hard to tell if a PS3 controller it´s a fake or not just by looking at it, but you´ll notice the difference once you try using it to play any game (I opened the controllers just to be sure they where fake).  My advice, if you can afford the price, save yourself some trouble and buy directly from Amazon expending the extra money for a new controller, if not, and you have the option to return your order (not my case, I´m outside US), do some Google search to find ways to know when a PS3 controller is a fake, and return any one you get right away.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Spoiler-free review is below.<br />Full review (includes name of heroine) is posted on my blog That's What I'm Talking About.<br />Review copy provided by publisher.<br /><br />My Rating: 4 stars: Enjoyed - strongly recommend (A-)<br /><br />HEART OF OBSIDIAN has finally arrived! The twelfth book in Ms. Singh's amazing Psy/Changeling series is a well thought-out adventure that truly does change the course of the overall series. Once again, Ms. Singh creates characters with beautiful emotional depth and detailed flaws, giving me a world that I want to fully explore.<br /><br />The opening of HEART OF OBSIDIAN has a very different feel than previous books in the series. The first several chapters are told almost completely from the POV of ex-Councilor Kaleb Krychek, someone we all know, but have never seen this up-close and personal. It was extremely fascinating for me to see how powerful he is. Another aspect that gives HEART OF OBSIDIAN a very different feel is the fact we don't know who the female lead is for the first five chapters. I liked this - it was like unraveling the pieces of a good mystery. Finally, after focusing primarily on the Changelings for the past several books, the primary couple in HEART OF OBSIDIAN is comprised of two Psys - something we've not seen before.<br /><br />The first several chapters of the story grabbed my attention - who was this mystery woman that Kaleb had been searching for all these years? Why is he utterly possessive of her? And the sections that were written from the mystery woman's POV were fantastic. The broken Psy female created mental labyrinths to protect her mind and inner core from the pain of torture and to prevent her enemies from breaking and controlling her. The writing detailed the madnesses of the shifting labyrinths with finesse.<br /><br />It's not until Chapter 5 that we discover the identity of this woman Kaleb has rescued. She is a Psy female with whom he shares a past. With an attraction to and an explicable trust in Kaleb, the mystery woman pushes her boundaries and heals rather quickly - although there are some memories that her body and mind will not allow her to recover.<br /><br />Much of the first half to two-thirds of the book focused on the slow process of regaining our heroine's memories, and it is also a carefully constructed release of information to the reader by the author. For the most part, the tale was successful at keeping me hooked, wondering why something was a certain way or who did what. However, I did feel that the book began to drag and got repetitive by the midpoint. Yes... He'd never hurt her. Yes... She is his weakness. Yes... He's got tons of power. Yes... She is the deepest fracture in his psyche. Yes... She belongs to him. I got frustrated for a little while.<br /><br />In addition, the beginnings of their romance were very cold and calculated, which rubbed me the wrong way - at first. I thought to myself, how much of Kaleb's interactions are part of his plans - seeing as he needed to bond with with our mystery Psy and get her to trust him.<br /><br />However... things quickly picked back up...<br /><br />As the pair truly get to know each other again and her memories return, we see a different side of the couple. They each grow and mature in ways that were extremely satisfying for me. I loved how our heroine would push Kaleb, but never abuse the absolute loyalty he's given her. She is completely feisty and such a strong woman. I admire that Kaleb stays true to his Psy nature and character, yet by virtue of his relationship with this female, he can see things and approach problems in a different way. And their sexual encounters were pretty smokin' hot! I just have to share one of my favorite lines, said by Kaleb to his female after their first time, \\"we've shared DNA.\\" I love it!<br /><br />We also learn quite a lot about Kaleb's past, which had a few twists and turns that kept me on my toes. I applaud the direction Ms. Singh took with Kaleb - never diminishing the monstrous things he's done or the darkness that surrounds him, yet supplying the reader with the bigger picture and reasons for his actions.<br /><br />For those anxious to see the Changelings - they get in on the mix in a supporting manner about halfway into the story. This also helps to pickup the speed of the book. The addition of multiple characters gives more depth to the story structure.<br /><br />In addition to the love story, the book spends much of its time on the escalating issues with the PsyNet, the actions of PurePsy and the overall story arc. Pretty much everything is revealed, including the future direction of the Psy race and its relationship with the other two races. There is a great deal of conflict caused by PurePsy, and once again, it allows for Kaleb to evaluate his position on Silence and his plans for his race. I enjoyed seeing how Kaleb dealt with conflict.<br /><br />Finally, I will note that the identity of the Ghost is revealed. However, after much hoopla over his character in previous stories, I was disappointed that we didn't even have mention of the Ghost until page 257. Overall, I have to say the Ghost storyline fell flat for me.<br /><br />In the end, I really enjoyed HEART OF OBSIDIAN. With the exception of a few minor issues, I feel this is one of the strongest Psy/ Changeling stories. I delighted in learning about the \\"real\\" Kaleb Krychek - seeing sides of him that only the heroine knows, and I adored her amazing strength and resilient character. The love story of the couple became stronger and more engaging as I learned more of their mutual past. What started out as cold, black ice, matured into warmth and sunshine. They are a wonderful couple and one of my new favorites from the series.eb - never diminishing the monstrous things he's done or the darkness that surrounds him, yet supplying the reader with the bigger picture and reasons for his actions.<br /><br />For those anxious to see the Changelings - they get in on the mix in a supporting manner about halfway into the story.

B002RKSCA6|5.0|I had no idea what to expect, but it was free for my Kindle and I thought &#34;Why not?&#34; My husband and I LOVED this story; we didn't want to put it down to get to sleep at night. The layers of significance, the insights into temptation/sin and human nature, the delightful dialog, the way it kept us guessing until the final explanation of everything. A wonderful, intelligent-but-accessible read in every way.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this case!  It feels comfortable in my hand, with a soft leather shell, and I especially love the handle inside that allows you to hold it securely.  The rotating feature inside is perfect for going from reading to watching TV or movies.  It also makes it easy to charge the Kindle without removing it from the case!  When folded back on itself, the elastic strap secures the case from flopping around.  The only thing I wish it had, was a way to secure the side of the Kindle in the center of the case.  It can be hard to hold vertically and keep the Kindle from falling forward.  That's mostly when you are laying down and reading.  If you are sitting up to read, it is not a problem.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.  It has given me the confidence to take my Kindle out with me more often.  It also allows for better viewing by a group, with it's prop-up system of display. Great product!
0765356147|5.0|An extremely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Sanderson unshrinkingly plumbs the depths of despair and forges through to the stunning new world on the other side, without ever sinking into maudlin meanderings, without ever losing the force and drive and sheer grittiness of the story or the simple realism of the characters. Altogether a beautiful, powerful, masterfully orchestrated tale throughout the three books, keeping you guessing at every turn right up until the end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I haven't read a book in a few years,  and wow what book.  I couldn't put down my kindle for two weeks.  Thank you E L James.
0765356139|4.0|Much of this book lags, in comparison with the first and third volumes. The developments are certainly interesting and the characters continue to be enjoyable and, at times, remarkably deep, and it's great watching Elend grow as a leader, but the siege goes on...and on...and on....while the constant question &#34;What do we DO??&#34; gets rrreeeeaaaaalllllyyyy dragged out as far and as long as it possibly can. And I won't even go into Vin's remarkably dense and self-absorbed waffling in this one. However, the last fifth of the book *more* than makes up for everything else. I can't emphasize that enough. Legends in the making, in which the reality may well be even more awe-inspiring than the stories that will later be told. This book certainly did nothing to dispel my developing notion that Sanderson is a genius.

B005HI4LLY|4.0|Call me crazy, call me corny... but I have fallen head over heels for this exuberant little bluegrass comedy thriller.<br /><br />Two endearingly dumb hick hillbillies, Dale (Tyler Labine) and Tucker (Alan Tudyk), are happily settling in for a vacation at their ramshackle cabin in the woods when their bliss is disrupted by the arrival of a carload of mindless college kids.<br /><br />During a late-night fishing excursion, the beer-loving buddies witness a swimming party and rescue one of the girls from drowning, taking her back to their cabin to recover.<br /><br />While Tucker spends his day working in the woods, Dale devotes every moment to humbly caring for their unexpected guest. Nice, pretty, intelligent and bland Allison (Katrina Bowdan) quickly loses her initial fear of her bearded, beer-bellied Bear of a host as she discovers him to be awkwardly shy, gentle, sweet-natured and seriously cute. In turn, the self-negating Dale is overwhelmed by the acceptance and warmth of this unattainable dream person. The two develop an unlikely friendship and cozily settle down to await the return of her friends.<br /><br />This is not how Allison's friends perceive the situation. They have been frightened by tales of bloodthirsty killers in the area and are certain that \\"Final Girl\\" Allison has been captured by savage rednecks. In their zeal to rescue her, they each rush to the attack - and accidentally cause their own violent, bloody deaths in the best FRIDAY THE 13th manner.<br /><br />TUCKER AND DALE vs. EVIL, like the classic ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), is that rarity: a Horror-Comedy that honors the genre and works on every level. It can be seen as the Laurel and Hardy version of such rural thrillers as DELIVERANCE and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. In this case the humor is restrained and character-oriented, and all physical comedy stems directly from the situation.<br /><br />The film's admirable achievement is that it maintains a buoyant sense of humor without ever mocking or compromising genre conventions. The point of view of the two groups of characters determines the alternating shifts of tone. The good ol' boys and their open-minded girl friend see the story as a rustic romantic comedy whereas the shallow college kids exist in a generic slasher-flick dimension, played straight with menacing music and every edge-of-seat beat in place. Whenever the two worlds happen to meet, the resulting absurdity twists the standard blood'n'guts \\"Kills\\" as a dynamic unity of shock and laughter. The deft balancing of this sharp contrast is the key to TUCKER AND DALE's success.<br /><br />Central to the movie's charm are the appealing performances of the three leads; especially big -- and big-hearted -- Tyler Labine, whose personal warmth and good-humor make this a splatter with soul.<br /><br />Add to this a genuinely warm and moving story of love and friendship between characters we come to care for, and you have a one-of-a-kind indie winner to treasure and remember.<br /><br />And, oh yeah -- it's awesome on eye-poppin' Blu-Ray, sporting an uproarious commentary track by Labine and Tudyk with director Eli Craig, and a short version of the film re-edited to portray The Boys as REAL mountain maniacs.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10  4½/5 EXCELLENTor without ever mocking or compromising genre conventions.

B0090KZDSK|5.0|So the question now is how long are we going to be waiting for #4 as (don't worry there will be no spoilers), this has left us just tantalised enough to need to know more, yet satisfied.<br /><br />The passion, the pain, the twists, the secrets, and the excitement are all present in abundance and I couldn't (and didn't) put it down. Whilst a couple of weeks ago I semi-groaned at the fact that there will be a 4th and 5th instalment having geared myself up for a finale, EWY simply reinforces that I'm not ready to, nor do I want to, give Gideon up. I will most definitely be reading the remaining books. And having seen the comments flying over social networking, there are clearly a huge number of readers who want more and if the readers want it, of course the authors and publishing houses are going to keep it going. But yes, perhaps they should have made it clear that it wouldn't be the final book much sooner.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I loved every minute (and am very jealous of all the readers who will be reading it for the first time).

He doesn't yet \\"read\\" per say, but the illustrations are so amazing that he can tell the story in his own words. Totally love it!

0345803485|1.0|Women have been the standard-bearers for society and society has been better for it. I blame women, however, for allowing \\"Fifty Shades\\" to find its way into our homes and libraries and bookstores.  Let's just call \\"Fifty Shades\\" what it is...porn.  We've legitimized it, taken it out of \\"adult\\" bookstores and given it our stamp of approval.  And from where I sit, we've opened a door that will be difficult to close.  And as we've allowed that now pretty much anything is acceptable, how can we object when our sons, daughters, husbands, etc. seek their own forms of \\"sexual eroticism\\"?  If those who have read this book are honest, somewhere, there has been a voice (conscience?) saying something about reading this isn't right.  These books are not just bad literature, they're dangerous to the human spirit.  It's time to raise our standards.  Surely we can do better than this.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This film, in my opinion, was the best of 2012.  Why it didn't win the Academy Award for Best Picture is beyond me!  I have seen Argos and there is no comparison.  I imagine that this film is the most realistic dealing with its particular subject matter that will ever exist.  I have been told since I was a child what a great man Lincoln was, but it was a nebulous concept to me.  Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal brought Mr. Lincoln to life and allowed me to understand what being a great man meant, as President during the Civil War.  I will always think of Lincoln as he was portrayed in this film.  There was no question about best actor in 2012 I don't think.  Lewis turned in a performance of a lifetime!  The other major players were excellent as well.  The screenplay would make an excellent history book told in the first person.  The sets, costumes, language and personal demeanors of the characters were right on target, lending a feeling of time and place that was amazing.  One relived history as never before by experiencing this film.  I give it highest kudos and my highest recommendation.  Don't miss it!  Spielberg triumphs once again!

0345347951|4.0|An excellent story, but I wish there had been more to it; the end of the story could have used more fleshing out.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the book I have been waiting for. After the first two books in this excellent series, I was convinced that Singh had managed to come up with a killer template for the rest of the series: passionate romance in the midst of intense political games and violent clashes between ideologies set in a unique and sprawling fantasy world. However, the majority of the rest of the books in the series haven't fully done all that for me though.<br /><br />Especially the recent ones just seem focused on the romance aspect between two lesser characters and haven't really seemed to push the overarching plot to the series. The thing about this series is though, I think the question of who the ghost is, and what's going to happen to the twin Net Minds, and whether a full on war is going to explode--are all more interesting than the romance of the week. Singh has simply created far too a wonderful world for these important matters to be pushed to the background. Therefore, I was hopeful that both we would soon get a book about Kaleb (as he is inexplicably one of my favorite characters even though it's been intimated many times that he's a sociopathic killer) as well as a book that would really push this series into a high gear regarding the series plots.<br /><br />This book changes everything.<br /><br />From the first page, you know big things are going to happen. Kaleb as a Councilor is simply too big a major player in the Psy world for his actions not to have massive consequences. We do find out who the ghost is, and without completely spoiling it for everyone, it's not wholly unexpected. In fact, it makes more sense than if she had picked another character-still it wasn't the big surprise that I was kind of hoping it would be. I think what made this book really different for me was that Kaleb, Nikita and Anthony finally band together beyond reactionary stuff. They make things happen as opposed to react together to things happening. On that note, the entire Psy world changes by the end of the book. The overarching plot is kicked into overdrive, and finally the big major changes that you hoped for actually happen.<br /><br />Also, the romance furthers and pushes the plot forward as opposed to halting it in the middle. However, there were times that that their interactions got a little repetitive (\\"she's broken\\" etc.) It was otherwise well done though, with palpable tension between the two. I think it was very important for Kaleb to have someone that could kind of match up against him instead of being a pushover, and I think Singh managed that very well.<br /><br />I think something brilliant about Singh's writing that I don't see often mentioned in reviews, is that her world building isn't just exceptional for a fantasy series--it's also a powerful commentary on many of the social issues being debated in real life. Not to read too much into the series, but coming from the Deep South as well as a massive history nerd, perhaps I'm more aware of situations where sometimes one group of people tries to isolate themselves or weed out the \\"unpure\\" ones, or those who just don't belong. I think this series is remarkable in being able to avoid the preachy aspects of a \\"we are all equal\\" agenda, but is still able to show through an engaging plot that a world full of diverse groups of people living harmoniously is to the benefit of all.<br /><br />In conclusion, I don't want want to turn this review into an essay, but I do want to make it clear that this book is one of the best not only within the series, but within the genre. While many series that get up to the 8-12 books range, tend to peter out idea wise towards the end--this book is the opposite of that. Singh simply nails it.by the end of the book.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I have revised my below review.......please disregard it. This album has taken a while to sink in but after a few more listens I think it's great!<br /><br />I was kind of hoping AIC wouldn't release any more albums, because the chances of an artist releasing nothing but CLASSIC albums throughout their career decreases with each subsequent studio release. That said, unfortunately, the release of this album has somewhat tarnished this band's legacy as this is the first one that is not an outright classic.<br /><br />It's a decent offering,but I am a little dissapointed overall compared to their prior output.  The whole \\"let's try to recreate the vocals of layne staley by mixing the voices of jerry cantrell and this new guy\\" idea is starting to get old a bit.  It did wonders on Black Gives Way to Blue, but here the formula tends to wear off - particularly once you get towards the middle and latter parts of the album.<br /><br />That said, I am very impressed by the track \\"Phantom Limb\\" - a very heavy, almost 80's-metal riff drives the song and propels the final climax.  By far the best song they've had since the early 90's.  I say download that and buy at your own risk with regard to the rest of the tracks.  Side 1 has the better songs than side 2, where it starts to drag a bit.<br /><br />By no means a piece of s***, and a LOT better than the new Soundgarden - I give it a 7 out of 10.

B008HK3XU4|2.0|The case does a good job of protecting the device in a purse or something, but it's not indestructible. My daughter still managed to shatter the glass on my KFHD while it was inside the closed case (which cost $125 to repair, and that was a steal). The sleep/wake lid has never worked, inconvenient, but not horrible. The stand-up feature is useless unless you want it completely vertical, but nudge it and it falls.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I read this few months ago but didn't review it. Enjoyed this book, but found it dragged in spots. He is master with a phrase. I think I'm ready for another.
1476704163|5.0|I've wanted this book since it came out last winter. I've been a huge fan of Ke$ha since I was 16 when Tik Tok came out and I definitely consider myself one of her animals. I watched every episode of her documentary on Mtv so I was worried the only pictures and stories in this book would have been told on the tv show. Not true! Many of the pictures are from her own family collection and she told many stories that weren't revealed in interviews or on the tv show. It's kind of like a scrap book with stories. I read it all in one night but I would still read it again and again. Not because I'm &#34;obsessed&#34; with her, but because it's an inspiration to follow your dreams and live life for today.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|So I am sure my review is based on the fact that we will probably have to wait another 8 months to a year before we get the 4th book, but I have to say I think I am over Gideon and Ava. Seriously, I feel like I just read the same book that I have before, nothing is totally resolved. If you are going to make us wait this long for a book that was supposed to be out 6 months ago and then jack up the price....at least give us something more than sex. Give us a real story line and one that actually ends!<br /><br />EDITED: I want to say that I didn't dislike the book. I did read it all in one sitting. I am seeing that fans are really upset about the reviews. I just felt we were dealing with the same issues from the second book but told in different stories through the book. I did see character growth and the relationship between them mature into a more loving experience for them. And I am happy that Gideon and Ava want each other but come on....after 3 books of it, I want something more in the story. And I won't post spoilers, but come on Ava...GIdeon made exceptions for you when it comes to exes, you need to do the same! And Cary....love him....will be interesting to see where she takes him story line that is for sure.<br /><br />Will I buy the 4th and the 5th....come on, its Gideon and Ava, of course I will....I just hope this doesn't turn into Sookie Stackhouse. Charlene Harris had a great thing going until HBO optioned her books and True Blood was created and her books just went downhill.<br /><br />Again...I liked EWY....I just don't know why there has to be a 4th and a 5th. You can tell she was so close to wrapping it up in this book. So close.

B00AZM7IQC|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I do love Cirque Du Soleil - I even paid hundreds of dollars to go to a local show.  I watched this movie in the cinema in 3D and my fiancee and I both loved it so much we bought it!  Much to our regret.  Sadly, Neither Amazon nor Paramount indicated in any way, in the info distributed or on the product packaging, that we would have to spend hundreds more dollars to upgrade our Blu-Ray players AND TVs to 3D capable models in order to view that disk.  Only after I inserted it did I get a 2 paragraph discourse saying it required not only a 3D capable player, but a 3D capable TV!  And, of course, it would not play the disc.  To add insult to injury, when I registered and logged onto the Paramount website to download my digital copy I was informed by the Paramount website that not only would it not download the full version, but would only download a lesser quality version because the equipment in my PC did not meet the minimum specs for viewing it!  What makes them even think I'm going to watch it on that PC?  And on top of that they timed out my download so I could not even get that!  What's up, guys?  I've bought many 3D movies and can view them on DVD, etc., without having to have special equipment!  What's up?  Leaving out that info, of course just in my opinion, is fraudulent, deceptive, whatever!  You withheld vitally needed information from me, and from the public . . . bottom line, I wouldn't have spent the extra money to buy the 3D version if I had known beforehand - you suckered me in . . . shame on you.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|There couldn't be a more appropriate title for the new George Benson project than Inspiration.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I downloaded Gone Girl to my Kindle last year after hearing a series of great reviews. \\"Great thriller\\" was the only thing I knew about the book, but I was please to also discover it is much more. It is a wonderful example of craft intersecting content; the classic page turner buried within a very innovate approach with strong writing.  The story is told completely in the first person by two narrators, a husband and wife, as they both describe her disappearance, with the two voices rotating by chapter.  The beautiful \\"Amazing Amy\\" has disappeared from her home, and her frantic husband Nick leads the search.  Their backstory in inserted early, primarily in Amy's voice, as she describes how they met in New York, fell in love, married, and eventually encountered financial difficulties that caused them to move to Nick's home town in Missouri and start a completely new life.<br /><br /> Flynn gets even more ambitious with the rotating voices by inserting what is essentially a third narration into the story.  Some chapters are notated at the beginning as a chapter from Amy's diary, which makes the first person even more personal.<br /><br /> Initially the book begins with the earmarks of the traditional thriller; beautiful wife gone missing, colorful cops investigating, interesting backstory about the wife and her family, enough weird character to keep you guessing about who might have taken Amy, stories of infidelity and sex, Nick's questionable agony over his missing wife. As often happens in these circumstances the husband becomes the main suspect, and much of the book is about him trying to defend himself.  I found myself wondering if Flynn was going to steal a technique from The Lovely Bones, and perhaps we would learn that Amy was narrating her portion from the grave, and Nick or one of the other characters would be revealed as a psychopath.<br /><br /> But the brilliance of the book is how all of a suddenly everything changes, with the first person narration transitioning to become a progressive personal journey into our characters' madness.  Through their own voices they reveal themselves, and by the second section of the book you begin to realize that either Amy or Nick is insane, and wonder whether or not one of them is the perpetrator.  Both of their voices completely change. The thrill of this thriller is then to decide which one has the biggest problem.  The both suffer from extreme narcissism and various personality disorders that cause you to doubt both of them.  The \\"perfect couple\\" we met in the first third of the book really doesn't exist.<br /><br /> Amy in particular takes on an almost Sybil persona - and for this becomes one of the most innovative techniques in the book.  One of the attributes of first person narration is that you normally accept the narrator is telling the truth as they see it.  They might be wrong - but they are being honest.  In this book by the second half we learn that our narrator has been lying to us, which becomes a great technique to build suspense.<br /><br /> I have always been a fan of the \\"con man\\" story - either in film or literature. The great and essential payoff to the con man story is when the trick is revealed.  With much delight we go backwards in time to show the viewer or reader the \\"slight of hand\\" - the thing they missed that puts the entire story together.  Flynn adds another dimension to her thriller with a terrific con man reveal, and we realize that almost all the narration we have read is suspect.  Other things were going on right in front of our eyes.<br /><br /> Ultimately Gone Girl is a wonderful journey into two people's madness, told with incredible literary finesse; a manipulation of the first person narration into what essentially becomes multiple voices from the same two people.  And unlike most thrillers where the trick is content-based, this really becomes a case of the innovative use of first person narration.tioning to become a progressive personal journey into our characters' madness.

B008220BP2|5.0|I read a poor review of this film on NY Times and from audience reaction to it, which was totally opposite from the review, I purchased this film, thinking I would probably only want to see it one time.  Boy, was I wrong.  Not only was it charming, witty, not dumb, and very, very well acted as well as produced very, very well, it had a performance by John Malkovich which was totally different from anything I ever saw him play.  In Zombie movies their is alway a fanatical, take no prisoners, kill everything in sight leader who at one point or another goes totally off the rails and starts butchering everything because it feels so good to him and gives him so much power.  Expecting this to be the type of character we were going to get, who would end up getting blown up or something, I was totally surprised when there were certain scenes in which the guy showed signs of being the leader, but not really knowing what he should do, so he'd ask for an opinion.  I'm not going to go into details because that would ruin it for you.  The film is really about the haves and have nots and that blasted 1% who wants to take over everything.  I totally loved this film and Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer were a sweet, sweet pair and their love story really drives the film.  Dave Franco is in it too, and as usual, he was tops.  For a young man with a not so buff body, Nicholas Hoult has a beautiful face, in fact he was much prettier than the heroine.  Kind of like Montgonery Clift up against Olivia DeHaviland in &#34;The Heiress&#34;.

1781162646|5.0|Joyland is an excellent story from Stephen King. He takes us back to the days when small private carnivals and amusement parks still operated, some traveling from town to town, appearing overnight after the trucks roll in and the tents are pitched, while some were fixed in place in the beach towns and vacation spots of our country. He gives us characters with heart and doesn't burden the story with gratuitous or contrived suspense.<br /><br />The main character, Devon, is a college student who takes a summer job at a small amusement park located in a beach town in North Carolina. He quickly fits in and earns the respect of the long-term carny hands as well as his fellow summer workers. He is an easy-going and reflective young man, going through the pain of first separation and then rejection from his college girlfriend. When the summer ends he decides to stay on full time at the carnival rather than return to school.<br /><br />Devon becomes friends with a woman and her son. They live in a large house on the beach, and the boy is wheelchair bound and stricken with Muscular Dystrophy. He also has a wisdom beyond his years, and he is able to see things that others cannot . Devon encounters them initially in his walks along the beach, and when he helps the boy to launch a kite into the wind, the ice is broken. The boy's young mother is protective of her son as well as suffering herself, partly from the stress of caring for her disabled boy and partly due to estrangement from her family. Gradually Devon becomes close to them, each helping the other to deal with the pains in their lives. Finally, Devon hosts them for a day at the amusement park, closed for the winter but powered-up for this special occasion. It is a wonderful gift for the boy who has until then only observed it from afar.<br /><br />The mystery of a long-unsolved murder at the amusement part builds very slowly as we get to know Devon and the other characters. Early in his employment at the park Devon learns of the death of a girl who had been on the ride in the house of horrors. Her ghost is said to continue to haunt the park. When one of his co-workers sees the ghost himself, Devon's desire to learn how she was killed and why it was never solved grows until he is consumed by the need to solve the crime. It eventually leads him to uncovering the long-buried truth, a great and surprising climax to the story.<br /><br />I think that it is great that Stephen King's latest novel has been released as an affordable paperback novel rather than an expensive hard-cover book (or as an e-book, although I'm sure that it will be eventually). The publisher - \\"Hard Case Crime\\" - is one that I have been familiar with for a while, because for the past several years they have been releasing paperback crime novels in the style of those published in the U.S. from the 1940's through about the 1960's - check out for example [[ASIN:0857683632 The Dead Man's Brother]], [[ASIN:0857687689 Blood on the Mink]], [[ASIN:B007DALD4M The Girl With the Long Green Heart]], [[ASIN:1596064897 Strange Embrace/69 Barrow Street]]. Stephen King has given them a huge shot in the arm by selecting them to publish his latest novel in this format, plus he has made it so much more affordable for his fans to pick up his latest novel at a reasonable price, and I salute him for doing it.<br /><br />(Hard Case Crime has also published limited-edition hardcover editions of this book, available at their website for a short time until they are sold out - just go to [...] and you will find them - for those who are committed King fans and must have hardcover editions of the book now).<br /><br />In a sense then, this book might be viewed Stephen King's homage to the days of paperback pulp fiction; the cover and presentation of the book is whimsical in the style of the pulp novels of fifty years past.<br /><br />King has written a story that is full of heart and compassion. This is a book that would be a great read evenwithout the murder mystery and resident ghost. To have them as well makes it a superb story and a great choice for summer enjoyment, at the beach or by the poolside.hem as well makes it a superb story and a great choice for summer enjoyment, at the beach or by the poolside.

There were two plot points I hated one involving Brett and one with Eva's mother, but that's the only bad part of the whole book!  I'm looking forward to the next book and the book after that!!  I love the journey to happily ever after!
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I really enjoyed this game a lot. Right until I did something else on my kindle and the let about 10 hours of game play and going down from a tiger shark back to a Freud game. I have now read several reviews and most of the negitive reviews are because of this problem. My guess is that it won'tbe fixed until it stars to cost the game company money.

B003SJ4VJ6|5.0|A few reviewers have alleged that Roman Polanski had a political agenda in making this film.  This is nonsense. He was the director, not the original writer.  In The Ghost Writer, he has brought to life a story that he believes in and while Polanski has a glorious history of controversy in his personal life, he continues to be a brilliant director.<br /><br />Robert Harris's book The Ghost serves as the basis for The Ghost Writer and he actively participated in the production of the film, sharing the screenplay credit with Polanski. The movie is almost entirely faithful to the book in it's structure, character development, and ideology. Some considerations were made to facilitate the pacing, but the most significant change was the improved ending.  I urge those who enjoy and understand this movie to read the book and compare Robert Harris's work in the two very different mediums. The story benefits from his collaboration with Polanski

B00499LTLM|5.0|I liked the series so much that I had to dig up the unaired version of the first episode somewhere deep and dark on the internet. To tell you the truth, it was good and worth watching, but the one that aired was flawless. There are so many nice touches that make the new one impeccable, like changing the Watson's iPhone to a more appropriate phone for his character and also his new modern walking stick/cane. So, why am I mentioning the unaired version in my mini review? Simply because it shows how much the creators love the show themselves that they had to bury the completely finished work and re-make it all over again! And, that is the Sherlock I watched and enjoyed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and has pretty good graphics. it is a good game for horse lovers. but be careful because you can buy thing on here for real money so not recamended for little kids.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|If you are a thrash fan and have read the reviews for this album; if you have listened to the samples; and if you have heard the singles then you should be aware that this IS NOT A THRASH ALBUM. It really shouldn't be a surprise to you!<br /><br />Megadeth have a vast catalogue of fourteen albums that encompass a wide range of styles from hard rock to thrash metal. Because of the diversity of previous releases it must be difficult for Dave Mustaine to write an album that will satisfy all sections of the Megadeth fanbase. I guess I'm lucky because I enjoy all the incarnations of Megadeth's sound.<br /><br />The overall feel of this album is very much hard rock with elements of traditional metal and thrash being present. The musicianship throughout is excellent. Mustaine and Broderick in particular provide some truly great guitar leads. It is the sort of album that benefits from repeat listening. To some extent age has taken its toll on the vocals of Mustaine and wisely he chooses to sing in a lower register rather than trying to achieve the sort of high vocal register that he is probably no longer capable of. Remember the guy also has to try and perform some of these songs live. There are still hints of the idiosyncratic snarl and venom to his vocals that make him such an enjoyable vocalist to listen to despite that fact he may not be the most versatile or naturally gifted. Personally I'd take the character of his voice over a clinical and sterile perfect pitch singer any day.<br /><br />Opening track Kingmaker is a strong higher tempo metal number that has found its way into the bands live show. Once again Mustaine illustrates his ability to craft catchy melodies which is repeated throughout the album. I know that I stand almost alone in my appreciation of lead single Super Collider which at first I found to be rather disappointing but after several listens it has ingrained itself firmly in my head. Once again the solo work is exemplary. Other notable moments are the use of blue grass/banjo in The Blackest Crow.  The cover of Thin Lizzy's Cold Sweat is well executed; and the influence of Rock and Metal bands of the past such as Lizzy permeate throughout this work.<br /><br />Overall, I find Super Collider to be an enjoyable and catchy hard rock album. Perhaps not as good as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction but to be fair how many albums are?
B00005NIE1|3.0|Musicalmente es un gran album, sera un clasico dentro de poco, el material de fabricacion del vinilo es malo realmente!<br />Great album (talking about music) will be a clasic, bad vinyl manufacturing unfortunately.

1781162646|5.0|Joyland is a great one or two sitting read.  It really flies in the face of people who type King as simply a horror writer.  He can weave a web of great characters and exposition any day.  It was a heart-felt if somewhat abrupt finish.
0385349947|4.0|This shipment arrived in good condition, have heard so much about this book, promises to be a good read. Thank you Amazon! Can now catch up with my literary side now that I know books can reach me in the most obscure places in the world.<br /><br />Yaay!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|definitely have to get this one in blu-ray! a nice sound system doesnt hurt either for a fantastic cinema event in your living room!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I almost went with the i5-3570K to get better graphics but ultimately stayed with the 3470. Since I'm not doing gaming, video editing, or anything too graphics intensive, this is more than suitable. The onboard graphics are more than adequate to support dual 1080p monitors and HD video streaming. Otherwise, all you need to do is read the other other reviews or look at the benchmarks--this is a great processor at a very good price.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Watched this with my 6 year old granddaughter and 4 year old grandson. Amazing, to me anyway, they both watched the entire movie and did not loose attention. Do have to comment that they were both tired and had just had dinner. The movie is fine but really geared to those that play arcade video games and their parents. Reference to Pac Man??? Really?? and code as in video game code??? Turn it on and leave your kids watching it?  Maybe but only if they 6,7-??? Again, they not going to get some of this movie. Plot?? Ok. I like \\"Despicable Me\\" more.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I loved this series. Starz did an awesome job depicting the era and man Spartacus. We see Spartacus align with his brothers while leading the revolt. Action, Comedy, Drama, and Gore all rolled into 1. AWESOME is such an under statement for this Series.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|I just love this movie. It is inspirational and a must have for every movie collector. Anna Sophia Robb played this character flawlessly. What a great story!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Andy Whitfiled is awesome. I did not know who he was until Spartacus and even in his death he has me. What a wonder person and great fit for the movie. This series it the first and boy is it good. Hard bodies, tongues that I find intriguing and women whose playing their parts well. This series is a must see and one you will never forget.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|...don't waste your money. I really wish Eva was a real person so I could shake some sense into her and tell her exactly what I think of her (none of which is kind) but then I have to remind myself that she is a work of fiction and to calm down. I know that it is the author's job to create an emotional attachment to the audience and character, but all I feel for the character is loathing(which I am not sure is what the author was going for). I am so frustrated with her. This book was sooooo not worth my time or money. If this book was free, I STILL would not buy it! Giving the book one star is being extremely kind,if it was an option I would give it half a star. Word to the wise Mrs. Day, if you are going to make your (ex)fans wait so long for your books and are going to build up so much hype for your books, make sure that they are actually worth reading. I am officially done with books by Sylvia Day.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|The first intro to Gannicus was no less exciting than the other Spartacus episodes. The man before the beast is awesome.

I really love the iconic \\"Pepsi\\" color themed bezel that reminds me of my father's watch when I was younger.  This watch goes in the book of must haves.  I am a big fan of mechanical watches and the craftsmanship that goes into them and keeping their power source very natural (body movement).

B00CATSONE|5.0|I just finished reading the very short book on Tesla by Sean Patrick. What an imaginative and selfless genius, but he was thwarted throughout his life by selfish and greedy men. One can only imagine a world where selfishness and greed do not exist, or at least don't prevail. Due to Sean's excellent but disturbing overview of those negative qualities I don't think I could enjoy reading about Tesla in any more detail.

B009AMAJPA|4.0|I'll admit; this isn't my typical kind of film. My main reason for seeing it was because the writer is Joel Wyman. I am a huge fan of FRINGE, a science fiction/family drama for which he served as showrunner and as a writer. He is also the creator/producer for \\"Almost Human,\\" a show starring Karl Urban and Michael Ealy, that will air in November on FOX. I was pleasantly surprised: it's not too shabby. The film uses an intricate little plot about Farrell's character's motivations, and how he was going to exact his revenge.<br /><br />Wyman seems to go for common themes in his work - love, building something, family, and connections. Although there is an underlying theme about love, the film does not skip out on the action: This is a story about revenge in the name of love, and there are several scenes in which people die in the most terrible ways imaginable. Even right at the start, when our characters get involved in a little \\"game.\\"<br /><br />Maybe I am a huge softie, but when we first meet Victor and Beatrice, who had been staring at each other across from their respective apartments, I felt very emotional about a specific gesture in the scene. There's a bit of a slow buildup, but that is suddenly dashed when we find out why Beatrice has really been watching Victor. Turns out she is in need of a bit of revenge, and she has some proof of something that could get Victor in a lot of trouble. As the plot progresses, these two seem to develop genuine feelings for one another. Victor lost something precious to him, and both could understand the need to make those responsible for their pain - pay.<br /><br />My chief issues with the film are as follows:<br /><br />First, Farrell... well, I hope he deliberately looked like he was staring into the distance all the time. I guess he had that thousand-yard-stare because of his family and his hopes to avenge them at all costs, but Farrell left me flat.  Noomi Rapace was OK, but I liked her much better in Prometheus. I found her Beatrice mostly annoying, although her backstory was heartfelt and I understood how she felt. In my opinion, Terrence Howard is the winner here, His Alphonse, a truly disgusting sociopath.<br /><br />Second, the love part was a hard sell for me because of the terms in which Victor and Beatrice become involved. But, then again, they did share a deep hurt, so they seemed to understand one another.<br /><br />Like many films, this one uses an object to convey some kind of meaning. I won't spoil it here, but I liked its use. There is also some nice use of cinematography.<br /><br />It was fun, and I felt my money was well spent.

B00CXN2JNS|4.0|If you've heard the first single off this album, \\"Super Collider,\\" chances are you're probably feeling it's lacking. It sounds like it came straight off the [[ASIN:B0002EXH5E Risk]] or [[ASIN:B00005EBQE The World Needs a Hero]], two albums notorious for having very mixed reviews and receptions. Personally, I didn't mind those albums, and the first single is OK. It's not thrash, though.<br /><br />Let's face it - the thrash bands of decades past are not what they once were. But despite the revolving door of Megadeth musicians, Dave Mustaine and company have managed to release new music pretty often, and that's a blessing in the grand scheme of things. I'm happy to have Super Collider even though it pales in comparison to albums of old. David Ellefson is back for another album (welcome back, Junior!), and that's something to be psyched about. He has writing credit for the opening song, \\"Kingmaker,\\" a nice thrash appetizer to set up the rest of the album... which is hit and miss.<br /><br />If you pay attention to other musicians' interviews and Tweets, some of them have harsh criticisms about this new stuff (Oderus Urungus of GWAR is pretty obnoxious). There are some really bright spots, however. \\"Burn\\" is a killer song and Dave Mustaine sounds great. Probably my favorite on the album. \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\" begins with some classic rock jamming and then the riffage really gets rolling. And the bass, oh, the bass. I don't understand why the song is so far down in the track listing, though. Move this one to the top please!<br /><br />David Draiman has small parts in \\"Dance In The Rain\\" and \\"Forget To Remember.\\" Ever read the Dr. Seuss story, [[ASIN:0394800893 Too Many Daves]]? Draiman's contributions are insignificant. There's also a Thin Lizzy cover, \\"Cold Sweat,\\" which is pretty heavy. It'll get ya moving.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag for Megadeth and not one of the best albums, but there is material to be happy with here. It just might take a couple listens to appreciate.reciate.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Ever been asked what is your favorite movie?  Mine is \\"A Good Year\\"...every time I watch it I relate my life to Max Skinner as a boy and his life at work and that there is more to life than work work work.  It brings tears and laughs at the same time.

B00C25TCZ0|4.0|Black Star Riders have released their debut album. While the name might not be familiar, the band's origins are. In short, Black Star Riders is the new name for the reunited Thin Lizzy. The album, All Hell Breaks Loose, is a hard-hitting rock album that could quite possibly be mistaken as a new Thin Lizzy album: the songs, for the most part, sound like they were made by Thin Lizzy. Out of respect to Lynott, the band decided to not record this album under the Thin Lizzy name. Still, All Hell Breaks Loose manages to be an enjoyable album that Thin Lizzy fans of old should listen to.<br /><br />Black Star Riders consists of guitarist/singer Ricky Warwick, guitarist Scott Gorham, guitarist Damon Johnson, bassist Marco Mendoza and drummer Jimmy DeGrasso. It should be noted that of the five members, Gorham is the only member that was in the original Thin Lizzy with Lynott. Still, the new guys seem to be huge fans of Thin Lizzy's work and are all great musicians.<br /><br />The self titled track is a simple badass rocking opener. The guitar riff sounds similar to the one in the Lizzy classic \\"Sha La La La\\" except a little more aggressive. Gorham and Johnson shine throughout the album, using the trademark Lizzy dual lead guitar sound to its advantage. An example of this can be found in \\"Bound for Glory\\". The song sounds an awful lot like something Thin Lizzy would've made back in the day. Warwick's vocals, especially on this song, could be mistaken as Lynott's at times. Of the 11 songs on the album, \\"Bound for Glory\\" is probably my personal favorite song.<br /><br />While \\"Bound for Glory\\" might be the most Thin Lizzy-ish track on the album, that doesn't mean the rest of the album isn't. Take a song like \\"Hey Judas\\", which is a great character-type song. Fans of Lizzy will know that Lynott liked writing songs about all sorts of characters such as Johnny the Fox and Valentino the gambling man. While partially based off Judas Iscariot, \\"Hey Judas\\" is a well-written song withLynott in mind. The same could be said about the rough rocking \\"Valley of the Stones\\", the bluesy flavored \\"Someday Salvation\\", and the military-riddled \\"Before the War\\"- all of which are based around history, another subject Lynott held close to his heart.<br /><br />As Thin Lizzy were originally an Irish rock band, the new band doesn't shy away from this fact. \\"Kingdom of the Lost\\" is a very Irish/Celtic influenced battle cry, complete with Irish whistles and even bodhrans drums. \\"This home is not our home from home/This land is not for free\\" sings Warwick. \\"No matter where I work or roam/Won't bring my country back to me\\". Other highlights on the album include the cowbell-driven \\"Hoodoo Voodoo\\" and bass heavy closer \\"Blues Ain't So Bad\\".<br /><br />All Hell Breaks Loose is an impressive debut effort from Black Star Riders. The album could almost been seen as a love letter to Lynott: from its Lizzy sound to even its title (a lyric in \\"Jailbreak\\"), it is a touching tribute. I'm sure that the late great Phil Lynott is looking down on the band, with a smile on his face; very proud.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Takes some getting used to at first, but now its really nice to use. Wish it would play last selection automatically but not a big deal.
0425263991|5.0|What it's about: This is the book I've been waiting for, the book I've been dreaming of ... Kaleb's book! I have loved Kaleb since his first appearance. Even when I thought he was pure evil, I loved him. Basic plot is the Net is rotting from the inside out; Kaleb is making a play to take over the Psy and the Net, but below that is the relentless search for what is his, what was taken and what he WILL have back ... Sahara.<br /><br />Why you should read it: This is fast-paced. It's dynamic, and Nalini is brilliant. One of my all-time favorites is Slave to Sensation, and readers can really see the evolution of the Psy-Changeling world in HoO. There was so much revealed and so much that happened in this installment. Seriously, I was blown away by the amount of action and violence and simple awesomeness that is HoO. I would highly recommend reading the books in order, though. There is a build-up and back story that you will miss if you skip ahead. Plus, some of my all-time favorite couples are in the first five books.<br /><br />Check out the HEA Blog for more recs and an interview with Nalini
B0031RS4V6|5.0|I found this story exciting and oh so different from the usual Stories of J.R. It placed him as a character who steps out of his usual comfort zone and I could not put it down.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|I bought volume 2 of their covers first and while I like the way they arrange music and the gravely sound of Luminati's voice is awesome. This album was even better I thought. It feels like they put more into thier original works than they did into thier covers which is what they are really known for. I hope they release more originals.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have been looking forward to this book forever! I thought it was going to be a trilogy but of course now that it's such a major series it's being drawn out to 5 books to toy us along.    Spoilers:  Why the hell can she not give up Brett? I mean really? Gideon KILLED someone for you and yet you still feel a sexual attraction to another man? I really pisses me off.    I was ready for the Happy Ever After. I guess I will have to follow the money trail to find it 2 years from now after I come to dislike Eva even more in the next 2 books and she wakes up.    AND for anyone that says that she never said it was only a trilogy, her website clearly states other wise if you would just look: [...]
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Liked all the music on the album, though there were some talking parts I could do without. Some folks did not seem to care for the lengthy last song, though it did not bother me, it had sort of a &#34;Gorillaz&#34; feel to it I thought.

B00BEXB18M|3.0|Telling people to spend their hard earned money on something that they might not like or enjoy seems a little out of character to me. So, before I get into the nitty gritty details of Super Collider. I would like to state 1) I own every Megadeth album, from the very beginning, even the Last Rites/Loved To Deth demo. I own Cryptic Writings, Risk, The World Needs A Hero. All of them! And I'm honestly disappointed in this effort.<br /><br />Megadeth is not a second rate band, never have been, and never will be. But...they have put out second rate efforts. It is not the \\"lack of thrash\\" that has me down in the dumps about this release (Its like everyone says \\"You just want this to be another Rust In Peace and you can't understand a band's diversity.\\") First off, thats BULL CRAP. I've seen this band go from state of the art speed metal, to thrash, to hard rock, to heavy metal, to rock, return to form thrash, all of the above. But this release is so disappointing. The production is just about as annoying as humanly possible. There are a few things I can't change about the album, Dave's voice...it is fading, big time. Chris Broderick, I've seen this guy and his solos AMAZING GUITARIST...this album does not paint him in a good light. And the drummer...he suffers from double bass overkill. Megadeth has done and could have done so much better. Another small thing, look at the lyrics, I don't expect anything from \\"Hangar 18\\" or \\"Holy Wars\\" but Megadeth have never had this much filler of chorus in their entire career. \\"Super Collider\\" is a prime example of this. Over half of the song is a chorus. On a positive note, the best songs on here are \\"Forget To Remember\\" its almost like a modern A Tout Le Monde. The melody is great and Dave's vocals are tolerable. I do like the darker semi-ballads like the second half of \\"The Blackest Crow\\" and the cover of Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\" is good, but, it doesn't even come close to Sodom's cover of the same song back in 1990.<br /><br />But!! If you like Thirteen, and maybe United Abominations, Cryptic Writings, check this out you may like it. If you were like me and wanted something heavier...Sodom's Epitome Of Torture is calling your name. Nothing against Megadeth, one of my favorite bands, but we all know Dave could have done better. In no way, shape, or form is this five stars. It DOES NOT, and CAN NOT stack up against their true five star albums, Rust In Peace, Peace Sells, Countdown, and even Endgame. Heck even their more melodic stuff (Youthansia, Cryptic Writings) packed a larger punch than this. If you like heavier music (thrash, death metal, etc) save your money. If you like modern rock, or hard rock...Super Collider might be for you.! If you like Thirteen, and maybe United Abominations, Cryptic Writings, check this out you may like it.

B00B99KJR0|4.0|Interesting and well thought out.  Challenging and a a good time waster.  It has a different take on the usual match-3 games with its story line and implementation. If you like these kinds of games, give this one a try. Graphics are okay.  There could be more animations. Overall, very good and I recommend it.
B000MTOLDG|4.0|Ah Lemmy. Friends, he is a true legend. He has been in the game long before Motorhead came around. And for a man of his age, and take no prisoners lifestyle to release an album like this and even the two most recent ones, is nothing but an incredibly large feat. Bastards is a great Motorhead album, not THE greatest...but stunning. The attitude, check. The power, you better believe it. The masculine feeling that any young college student can get this making him feel invincible just by listening to Motorhead, oh yes...check. Lemmy's voice is killer as always. A bit more gritty than previous releases but that just adds to the badassery. With tracks like \\"Death Or Glory\\" \\"I Am The Sword\\" \\"Born To Raise Hell\\" \\"Liar\\" and \\"Devils\\" this release is a hard rock, heavy metal lover prayer come true. Bastards is a must have, even if you are an avid fan of the band (and thats a crime by the way, being an avid fan)

B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The finale was really great--by never giving up, Rose got to see what he saw.  Any time I find I hate to see a Doctor change, I know it's been a good series.  The attachment to the characters really builds over time.  Like Rose, I suppose I will adjust to the new Doctor in time!

B00CW665VI|5.0|What a fantastic story. I loved Drew... arrogant, cocky, confident, smart, witty, sarcastic and FUNNY. . Then there's Kate the one woman not drooling all over him the instant they meet, and yeah the sparks fly, but she's engaged and the sexual tension is ever present. The verbal sparring here is fantastic, and I LOVED that the whole thing is from his POV. I must have highlighted half of the book. I do have to mention Mackenzie and her swear jar... the kid will be a millionaire by the time she's 18 with Drew around. Emma Chase has a winner here with this one, and I can't wait to read the next in this series.

193700788X|5.0|...on a good note!  Sure, we didnt have as many dramatic killer fast-pace scenes, but did we really need any?  I feel like logically, if you want to try and make logic in the Sookieverse, we've been through enough already.  I felt like the slow pace of this book was actually of pleasurable reading quality.  We talked everything out and tied off all of the loose needs-all while setting up the reader to imply the happily ever after.<br />SPOLIERS<br />The reasons why this book is hated so much is because of the Eric/Sookie fanbase.  Boo hoo, you guys lost.  So sad.  Get over it!  From the beginning of the novels the author said Sookie never wanted to be a vampire.  And honestly folks, look at Sookie's personality-she's a sunbather who loves gardening and warmth and wants lots of babies.  Hello people, the novels are first person-you know all this after 13 books.  So Sookie couldn't have ended up with Eric.  Also, I feel as though the author did a wonderful job of explaining every reason Sookie and Eric would've been miserable together.<br />The way I see it, Sam and Sookie were meant to be from the start.  That's the way things would've been had Bill never come to Bon Temps.  With him she can stay human, stay in the sun, and have lots of babies.  PERFECT ENDING.  FANTASTIC JOB HARRIS.<br />Also, on the note of the third person fiasco.  The third person POV was NOT used for Sookie, which is what I feared it would be after reading so many reviews complaining about it.  It's used for the antagonist's POV, with I thought was intriguing.<br />On a side note with the antagonists, I feel like I really did enjoy having a devil (not THE devil, as it is written) villian.  I also enjoyed who we saw come back as a second sets of evil.<br />And why the hell are people complaining about the garden?  I loved the flourishing plants-they added dry humor into some dialogues.<br />After finishing writing this review I am giving this novel 5 stars.  It is the same Stackhouse Harris has always given us to love, and it the perfect conclusion to a wonderful novel.<br />So folks, put away the fangs and enjoy the read.  It might not be the ending you were expecting but it's the ending Sookie deserves.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I cannot believe this!!! We've waited and waited and we get this bull***!! We have read that it was going to be a trilogy and then all of the sudden we get that there will be 2 more books. All the book was just a filler. No advance of the story. Just dumb stupid excuses to make the story longer. Like people said, she could have ended their love story and then do the other characters in the 4th and 5th book. The people who loved it don't think that the book company just wanted to expanded it to make more money. The love story got lost somewhere just so they could make more money. I'm glad I could return it and not buy any more books from her. What a big disappointment!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I cannot even begin to explain how disappointed I am with the third installment of this series. I feel like this book was one HUGE run-on sentence. Not only did I not care about most of the things happening, but I felt like it was irrelevant. Who cares about Megumi ... she's not at work so let's just chalk it up to her having a nasty bug, no need for any drama there.<br /><br />Corrine? I don't see why her attempting suicide was necessary.. I guess just something else for Gideon to stress and worry about. Her and her husband's drama need to be taken back to Paris where it belongs.<br /><br />This whole new information about Nathan was unnecessary also. In Reflected in You, the Detective said she couldn't prove anything so WHY is the question of his death still a factor? We know who killed him.. so let's just make it a cold case and get on with it.<br /><br />Brett and this sex tape is more UNNECESSARY drama. We know Eva had sex .. A LOT, I'm over her old life.. I was over it after it was introduced.<br /><br />All this drama in the book was NOT needed and I think, it should have ended with Entwined with You. BUT since we have no choice but to impatiently wait for another installment, us as readers will make due. But FIVE books about these two? NOPE BAD IDEA. It's just stretching their story too thin. Everyone loves a good erotic romance novel with some drama but 1 more book is a stretch let alone 2. So how about Sylvia Day do us ALL a favor and write ONE more book for this series, where Eva and Gideon overcome their obstacles, have awesome sex, and have a real wedding. Write an epilogue that makes us happy and go on about your life as if this book never happened. To be truthful it should have probably been called Entwined with You (A CROSSFIRE NOVEL 2.5) instead of 3.<br /><br />Sorry to be so blunt but ... this book made me VERY angry.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game<br />Runs smoothly<br />Online works great<br />Lots of content<br />Fun overall<br />Needs moar BUDDER<br /><br />Also, if play any of that fake minecraft crap... I WILL FIND YOU...;)
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart and fast - paced!<br />Loved the high fashion look.<br />Can not wait for the next season<br />I really enjoy this program
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|A book which puts in complete focus the theory and the actual practice of being productive, and more than that - working out what to be productive with in relation to your true life goals. The simplicity of focus with the right direction.Much, much needed in our multitasking world.
6302212529|5.0|Well done again Disney. I think it is one of the best in a long time and does nothing to deteriorate your position
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is great app to use. Very simple, but keeps your attention. My 10 year old<br />daughter loves to play this app. The graphics are very clear and better than any I have seen. I would recommend this for anyone of any age.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and can't wait for season four to come out!  Good job Amazon, neither Hulu nor Netflix has season 3!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Nice game with bigger jewels. Something I truly appreciate. Thanks! I've been looking for a jewel game with something a little different. FINALLY!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I had been looking for a battery pack charger for a while now and stumbled upon the Anker brand by accident. I was excited at the price but also worried at the quality I would be receiving. I had seen some reviews on cheap batteries where the amount of power was significantly less than advertised or just felt cheap in the hand. It wasn't until after I had ordered that Gizmodo ran an article about the best battery packs where Anker came out on top. I was relieved. When I got the battery I charged it up to full and tried charging my iPad 3 and iPhone 5 at the same time. No problem! I used the battery pack this last weekend at the airport and my phone charged from 50% to 99% in about 20 minutes out of the 2A port. I love this thing! The only thing I wish I had known was that this was the previous generation model and that there was a higher capacity next gen model for just $5 more. Oh well. This model does have a flashlight which is nice in a pinch. I would definitely recommend this pack or the newer model.
0062073567|5.0|I should start by saying that while I am a fan of the Poirot mysteries, I have not read all of them. That said, I doubt any of them will ever beat \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" for the spot of my favorite mystery novel. Yes, this isn't just my favorite Poirot, it's my favorite mystery novel.<br /><br />Much has been said about the novel, many reviews comment with delight at the solution of this one, and how it's probably one of the cleverest Christie devised, and I fully agree. This is one of those wonderful \\"fair play\\" mystery novels, every clue needed to find the solution is there. One need only look for it, and take Poirot's advice, that if there are not multiple witnesses, then one should question an alibi.<br /><br />So much has already been said about this novel, that I feel I would only be repeating what others have said... and probably not as well as a good portion of them. I write this review only because there are some novels that feel as if they need as much praise as they can receive, even if it's already been said before. I'm just adding one more review to the pile in the hopes that maybe even one more person will read this.<br /><br />Recommended for any mystery fan... and if you're an Agatha Christie fan who hasn't read it, correct that as soon as possible. This one's brilliant.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun and easy once you get the hang of it because at first you crash a lot because of the controls but I still give this game 5 stars because it's so fun
B00AI4PCYW|5.0|Definitely worth the money to feel the warm glow of analog again.  I promised myself I would play it once and then record it to reel to reel and my computer at a high bit rate, but I have violated that promise already.  Masterpiece!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I couldn't put it down, I was hooked from page one to the last!<br /><br />Kaleb has made significant appearances in previous books, to the point that much has been speculated about him, but even then, there were plenty of surprises about him in the book.<br />Sahara is virtually an unknown, except for a single line in Visions of Heat, where she was mentioned as Faith's missing cousin. However, there were plenty of backstory to get to know her.<br /><br />I welcome the return of the focus on the hero and heroine.<br />While I loved Kiss of Snow to bits, it left me frustrated that Hawke and Sienna had to 'share' their book with another couple, much as I like Walker and Lara. I'm only glad that Tangle of Need and Texture of Intimacy fixed that. And I'm not really concerned what happens next to Adria and Riaz. So, I'm happy that Heart of Obsidian focused on Kaleb and Sahara's story.<br /><br />Now, if Hawke is the alpha of wolves, I'd say that Kaleb is the Arrow alpha. Yes, Aden leads his men, but in terms of capabilities, if there ever was the most *dangerous* Arrow, it would be Kaleb.<br /><br />In a sense, Kaleb is more, he's now the 'alpha' of the entire race hooked to the Psynet!<br /><br />And much like the proverbial rudder could turn the whole ship, Sahara is Kaleb's rudder -not in the sense that she's controlling him, but that without her, Kaleb would have been lost, would have given in to the darkness.<br /><br />I had time to know Kaleb, so there's this automatic attachment to him from the first page. Sahara however, I'm still 'processing'. I won't say that she's so horrible that I'd love to strangle her, but...the way I feel right now, is 'indifferent', which is to me, more horrifying than hating/disliking a character!<br /><br />Perhaps I need to wait a few more days of re-reading to assess her 'accurately'.<br /><br />Kaleb is how I imagined he would be. Nalini stayed true to his character, while turning him into a romantic lead who can both intimidate and yet at the same time, make the heroine feel safe.<br /><br />I like that their relationship started when they were kids, otherwise, it would have been hard to imagine Kaleb this dedicated to his woman. It would have sound forced or contrived. Those glimpses of their past was touching, completing the complex picture of who Kaleb is.<br /><br />My only 'complaint' with the book is how much I missed my beloved SnowDancers, I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms already!<br /><br />At least there's Judd, and his meeting with the Ghost hinted that Operation: Ming is a Dead Man Walking is underway! I'm really excited for the final showdown!<br /><br />One thing tickled me pink! The line about how Sienna might be the only individual on the planet as dangerous as Kaleb. Hah! I really like that! :D
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever besides minecraft halo and others once you play this game you will get hooked
B008602KQI|1.0|I'm not sure why The Hunger Games is considered that great of a show or book.  After the first half it becomes increasingly Dark.  The morbid twists in being excited to kill another person is about as evil as you can get.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app ever there is no app better than this It is awsome it is the most awesome app ever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games out there. It is fun, cool, and changes up the game every month.  Last month it was Tokyo and now it is Miami!!!!!!! Totally awesome!!!
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Gladwell weaves another trademark tale, parsing big data and disparate studies to drive home remarkable point about humanity. Everything is neatly tied together, and characters you meet early own move in and out of later scenes and arguments, reinforcing them all. Can you believe I'm talking about a non-fiction book? That should be the greatest testament to his journalistic style.
B0042816YK|1.0|Movie itself didn't play  It was like someone recorded in a storm couldn't even see the film.  The previews worked but not the movie.
B00AHXIC50|2.0|I'm used to picking up older classic rock CD's. and there are a lot that don't sound bad for all being recorded back in the day...  I like this album but the mp3 version just sounds a little muffled. Don't know how else to explain it.  But I don't have the disk to do a comparison. So I'm not sure if its the recording or it just lost a lot being compressed to mp3 format. But I do like a lot of the songs on this album.
B000AP04OM|5.0|a story with uplifting elements to it that was based on a true story.  this is one of the two musicals i recommend and wow with 1300 reviews that has got to be the thing on here that i have reviewed with the most reviews!  which means basically ,means somebody else had to say it was worth watching! this had the song my favorite things in it and the farewell song.  (if you're like me you like the john coltrane my favorite things version too.  he brings joy to his version too.)  the other one i recommend it the king and i and it is also endearing and uplifting and interestingly based on a true story too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have found this app quite useful on my kindle fire. I like how it allows me to follow multiple locations at once.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|The beginning of the novel is exciting, interesting, and leaves the reader full of questions. The amount of time Pi spends on the lifeboat with the Tiger became almost unbearable for me though.<br /><br />Good writing with many easy to picture scenes, but it just drags on too much in the middle.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|This was a good movie. I think it's really sad that they think they have to include cursing and innuendos of cursing in a movie especially when it's an animated movie.
1401322786|5.0|Mitch Albom does an amazing job of capturing your imagination and your heart in such a small number of words. 3 stories are intricately intertwined in this wonderfully warm and thought provoking novel.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone that likes any time of literature (science fiction, romance, adventure: It fits them all!)<br /><br />Read and enjoy!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This story in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians was a good and fun read.  I am ready to read the last also.  I am also reading other series by Rick Riordan.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A great and gripping story. Even though you're pretty sure you know what's hiding in the cupboard, it still shocks you when the discovery is made. The story thereafter is equally as heart wrenching and compelling. A definite read for WWII fiction fans, as well as for anyone that has a brother or sister.
B000MV9026|2.0|I thought this would have more of a story and less of a crazy, chaotic cartoon musical.  The singing was fine but it seemed to just be random songs thrown together.  I didn't care for it and either did my under 5 yr old children.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This is just an amazing novel all around. Especially in light of the events in Ohio recently where women had been held captive for years and escaped alive.<br /><br />The writing is very well done. I always remember being told in creative writing class to never write from the point of view of a young child because if you, as the writer of age 35, put your brain in a young child's, it's not going to sound natural.<br /><br />Donoghue does a masterful job of making a 5-year old come to life (especially given the unique circumstances in which he and his mother are living).<br /><br />It is gripping, suspenseful, and easy to picture the scenes and settings! It's a great great great read!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I only played once and not fair to say one way or other. don;t know what else to say but I am being honst
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I pretty much see 'em all and, can't really tell you why this movie fascinated me and was engrossing start to finish. Visually beautiful special effects. I particularly liked the story of tom and andrea riseborough and their interaction in being an \\"effective team\\". The twists and turns ,i thought, set it apart from your usual straight action sci-fi. I was disappointed that more of the American audience passed on this film and am perplexed as to why. Sure, it's nothing earth shattering and it's even a \\"clone\\" of previous films but i thought it to be a good production and well done....then again, i'm one of the few that really liked \\"jack reacher\\"( and prometheus and john carter and the host....what's wrong with me?).<br />I look forward to my library copy.
1250006341|4.0|This coffee table book takes the reader into the world of the PBS Masterpiece show \\"Downton Abbey\\" with many, many on-set pictures of the cast and crew as well as taking us into the world of the lords, ladies, and servants who filled Britain's country houses at the turn of the century.<br /><br />The inspiration for the series came from an Academy Award-winning film called \\"Gosford Park\\" that Julian Fellowes wrote, which had as its setting a large country house in November 1932.  The film focused on a shooting party and their servants were the primary characters.<br /><br />Having watched the series on PBS, I can honestly say I did not expect to like it; it seemed very stuffy, very stiff-upper-lip.  But as I continued watching and getting involved in the lives of the three daughters of Lord and Lady Grantham (Sybil, Mary, and Edith) and as I saw the scheming between Thomas and O'Brien in the servants' quarters, I grew to love the characters and the show.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the show, pick up this book and begin reading.  You will be surprised at how historically accurate the show is, from costumes to set design.  The book also includes snippets of the show's wry dialogue and interviews with some of the main characters' actors.  Highly recommended.
6305546789|5.0|I love this movie/series. This is the best one they ever made though. Very scary and suspenseful. Most Awesome movie ever!
0451228731|2.0|Generally, I know if I'm reading a good book when I look over at the alarm clock and it says it's 2 am and I'm still up wondering what's going to happen next, or in this case, angry with the author.<br /><br />\\"Daemon\\" is a techno-thriller that asks the question: what would happen if a mad genius decided to overthrow the Internet?  Matthew Sobol, a genius game designer, has apparently let loose a daemon (in computer parlance, a program running behind other programs) when his obituary is released on the Internet.  Suddenly, two of his programmers are killed and a series of events commences that may change civilization forever.<br /><br />The author's pacing is excellent; there are no scenes or dialogue that aren't central to the plot.  However, the book itself has a pessimistic tone, because no matter what the good guys do, the daemon continues running.  It's interesting how the author notes that the AI engine Sobol invented doesn't just challenge players in his games, it manipulates them.  Throughout the book, we see people being divided into those who work for the daemon (generally, the disenfranchised, disaffected) and those who want to stop it (Peter Sebeck, \\"Tripwire\\" Merritt, Jon Ross/Matthew Lasseter).<br /><br />It is slightly reminiscent of \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"The Terminator\\" franchises, which showed us a world where humans were no longer in control and machines had taken over.  However, this daemon is far more insidious in that it uses humans to achieve its purposes.  But I can only suspend my disbelief so far: Sobol's plan relies on so many variables that it renders itself impossible.  There is a second book, \\"Freedom\\" that I would like to read, but this book only gets two stars from me.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this band. They are the best rock band today still putting out great, creative art. These guys are true artists and I truly appreciate what they have contributed in their careers. To better help you know where I'm coming from I am a fan of all their albums. Their first album though is probably my favorite, followed by lullabies to paralyze. Of course they are all great albums, even era vulgaris which isn't maybe as great as the others but is good in it's own right. So now onto this new album. In my opinion from a songwriting standpoint, it is the best album Homme has written. It's deep, gorgeous, personal, dark, and it rocks. It doesn't have the drive of some of their early work, they went a different direction with this one, and they totally nailed it. It has a more ballady, epic feel, more thoughtful in its approach. It's a bit like elton john's goodbye yellow brick road if they were mixed with pink floyd and then added the unique homme and co twist to it. The lyrics are soulful as well and some of the best of their career. It doesn't really sound like any of their other albums, yet there is no doubt when I listen to it that it is the Queens of the Stone Age, and that it stands up to their best albums. If you are a fan of rock and roll, and a fan of real music, music as an art form and a fan of this band, I cant see you not appreciating this great album.
B007IK44CK|4.0|So insane it makes you laugh in the most dangerous scenes! Very futuristic high-tech type of movie. Leaves you wondering if what you just saw is actually possible. Hey, you never know!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I think this is probably one of my favorite cut the WHOLE entire world! I recommend this to everyone who enjoys playing Cut the Rope.<br /><br />Oh and you'll love the little Viking Om Nom :)

B003G4W49C|5.0|Second time reading Enders Game.  First was 10 years ago.  It is great/amazing.  Can't fathom how Card comes up with his stories and insights. And I just plain love the way Card writes  Enders Game is a classic for very good reasons.

B005KELW26|4.0|Fits the Kindle well and has lasted long. Not bulky at all and relatively inexpensive compared to similar products. Very satisfying buy!
B00BEXB18M|2.0|I received the album on Saturday(yes, I'm special :-)) so I've had a few days and a few spins, and while there are some bright spots, the album is overall just plain weak. Naturally, I have to ask myself if I would like it or feel different about it if it were a \\"hard rock\\" album released by a new band, where my reaction is not prejudiced by years of Mega greatness. The answer to that is, I don't know...maybe? But, the fact remains, we've come to expect something from a Megadeth record, and this album doesn't have enough of it for me.<br /> I'd like to believe that I'm more than willing to embrace a departure, if it achieves greatness, but I just don't hear it here.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The book starts well but as the plot unravels one starts to lose interest. The end is not so satisfying.
B000QZTNQ6|5.0|Not really sure why I'm reviewing this. There are more than enough reviews of this album to explain in vivid detail the sonic greatness within, but I just felt I had to add my two cents.<br /><br /> If this album doesn't make you want to grow your hair down to your feet and climb a mountain while lifting weights and battling blood thirsty fire breathing mythical creatures that you can communicate with telepathically, and must vanquish in an effort to bring order to the universe, then you just don't have it loud enough. It's just epic!!! Buy it!
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|Legendary maestro jazz guitarist/singer song-writer George Benson plays classical music in this new CD release titled 'Inspiration: A Tribute To Nat King Cole'. After a successful 4 year touring (paying tribute to Nat King Cole), George Benson finaly has released his interpretation of timeless classics studio album from Nat King Cole. He has Nelson Riddle's orchestral/classical arrangements and uses the services of a 42-piece orchestra to achieve a beautiful 'big band sound'. Featured artists include legendary trumpeter Wynton Marsalis in the track \\"Unforgettable\\", singer Idina Menzel in the beautiful duet \\"When I Fall In Love\\", Till Bronner in the slow-tempo \\"Smile\\" & Judith Hill on \\"Too Young\\". Lil' Georgie Benson is featured in the opening \\"Mona Lisa\\" (just for fun I would guess).<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"When I Fall In Love\\" & the jazzy melodical \\"Route 66\\". Not far off are \\"Just One Of Those Things\\" (great cabaret singing), \\"Walkin' My Baby Back Home\\", \\"Ballerina\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"Too Young\\" & \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\". Just okay tracks are \\"Unforgettable\\", \\"Nature Boy\\", \\"Straighten Up And Fly Right\\" & \\"Mona Lisa\\" (by George Benson himself this time on the closing track).<br /><br />On overall, George Benson surprises me in this new CD 'Inspiration: A Tribute To Nat King Cole' with a well executed classic/big band interpretation of great classics from the late classical singer song-writer Nat King Cole. There are however some highs and lows, but overall well presented. A recommended CD listening.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a fun game with lots of hidden object scenes. The pages load and run smoothly. My only gripe is the lengthy story text inserted between scenes. It's more distracting than informative, but it can be skipped. If you have to log off before reaching the end of the game, you'll have to start over from the beginning. The puzzles aren't difficult and each one has a skip button so you won't get stuck. The game lasts a long time and stays interesting throughout.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I've been a huge (did I say huge? I meant GIGANTIC) Paramore fan since their inception in 2005. As many other fans have noticed, Paramore has no one definite sound. Sure, Hayley's signature voice can be detected in any song by even the slightest fan, but in all honesty, every single one of their albums had a different overall feel to it. This album is no different.<br /><br />I know that some people were put off because the songs on this album sound more Pop than Rock, but if you're a music fanatic (like me) and are able to hear the beauty in all music, you will be able to hear the riffs and melodies that you've become so accustomed to.<br /><br />It's an amazing album. The songs are deeply personal, describing and referencing to the departure of the Farro brothers. Songs like Ain't it Fun and Movin' On are super fun to sing to, although they may surprise you with the raw, unyielding emotion that is displayed.<br /><br />Overall, if you are someone who enjoys good music, or, if you're a Paramore fan that is curious to hear what all the fuss is about, this album is definitely for you.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was very disappointed to find that this was not the last book in the TRILOGY.  I had per-ordered it and waited and waited and waited for the release.  Now, I will be returning it for a refund without reading it at all.  I'll just have to use my own imagination to create an ending that may never come from the author.  The book is an obvious attempt at robbing the public and trying to squeeze every last ounce of tolerance out of a devoted fan base.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I have to agree with another person.  The selection of songs is not great.  There is not one song that really stands out.  They need more edge to them.
B00479SVBU|4.0|super easy to setup...great for the price..the only modification i would make....the way this unit organizes music is a little funky at first, other than that...awesome!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I don't have any idea why, but I enjoy this game about as much as my 4 and 6 year old girls.  It is very cute and engaging.  Looking forward to taking it with us on our upcoming summer road trips.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game broke my kindle.  it made the kindle freeze up numerous times until it finally just wouldn't respond to anything. thankfully amazon replaced the kindle. play at your own risk.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|thought this game was very lame and not sure why it ranks so high.  Took it off of my iPhone.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I would not buy this because on my kindle fire it kept clutching to make it look like I was floating, and I could not turn or jump or slide.
B004PR71JC|5.0|I think I've listened to this CD several hundred times.  My girls, 4 and 6, LOVE it and I really enjoy several of the songs.  It isn't one of those CDs that you wish got broken/lost after hearing it for awhile.  We have found the best thing to do is buy soundtracks from movies we like.  This way the entire family enjoys the music more.
B008602KQI|4.0|I can't imagine this being a tween movie but the story was great and there wasn't an actor I would categorize as bad. It was action packed and well shot. The story reminded me a lot of Lord of the Flies meets Tunnel in the Sky.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Move over Kiss of Snow.  As much as I loved that book, Heart of Obsidian is even better.  Easily and completely my new favorite in the Psy-Changeling series. I'm going to try very hard not to spoil the story beyond a basic set-up, but I am going to mention the hero and heroine by name, so beware.<br /><br />Kaleb Krychek has been this powerful enigma ever since the series began. He is cold and calculating.  But there is a fire under that ice that is positively molten.  He has led a life shaped by cruelty at the hands of his mentor.  He was brutalized. He never knew love or loyalty, until he met Sahara Nightstar.  As children, they became the best of friends. She was his one solace... until she was ripped away.  He has spent the past seven years searching for her.  And now that he has her back, he will never let her go again.<br /><br />There is so much passion and emotion in this book.  Kaleb's devotion to Sahara is so complete, so unbreakable, it's breathtaking.  He is willing to do anything --give anything-- be anything-- for this fragile, abused woman.  He would burn the world for her, and, frankly, he has the power to do it.  His memories of her have shaped his entire life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, she has no memory of him at all. Years of torture have robbed her of so much, yet she knows him on a visceral level. She trusts him; she is drawn to him.  And as she heals, she begins to remember him in bits and pieces.<br /><br />I love these two as individuals, but they are exponentially more amazing as a couple.  What they bring out in each other is the very best part of the book.  Their love is unconditional.  They do not try to change each other.  They simply are better people because of each other.  Kaleb is no saint; he never has been. But Sahara doesn't expect him to be. She SEES him and loves him anyway... no --not in spite of who he is, but BECAUSE of it.  He was forged in fire and it was what made him the man who owns her heart.  It's her unflinching love of his true self that has changed his life; it is the delicate string that makes him a man instead of a monster.<br /><br />I could gush forever on the dynamic of the relationship... on how amazingly Nalini Singh crafted this bleak, unbending man who holds on to his humanity with the ray of hope created by one woman's regard.  I could warn you to arm yourself with a fan to cool off from the OHMYGODHOT sex.  But I would be remiss if I didn't also at least mention two other major points. One: We finally learn the identity of the Ghost and it's revealed in fabulous fashion.  And two: the ending is huge.  It will change the course of the series.  It speaks to just how epic the romance is, however, that when the story is done, that's really all you'll be thinking about.<br /><br />I would not change a thing about this book.  It was phenomenal. Go buy it right now.<br /><br />Rating: A+is true self that has changed his life; it is the delicate string that makes him a man instead of a monster.<br /><br />I could gush forever on the dynamic of the relationship... on how amazingly Nalini Singh crafted this bleak, unbending man who holds on to his humanity with the ray of hope created by one woman's regard.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Highly recommended. Better than the tv show. Worth the time. Even better the second time. Martin is amazing. Can't wait for #6.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|limiting.<br />Just like cut the rope...it takes too many stars to get to the next level!!! Even if you get 2 or 3 stars on every puzzle&hellip;you reach the end and you can't move forward even though you solved every puzzle. You should be able to move forward&hellip;then when you reach the end of the game you can go back and try to improve on each puzzle. Stuck needing 1 star to get to level 5. Frustrating!!
0425263924|1.0|you know...I love this series so much ..which makes this even harder to accept for me. I was okay with having three books and making it a trilogy but now? I was so excited to read this book ...I was waiting for this day so i could read the ending of Gideon and Ava's story line. Then what a shock to find out this morning, as i was about to buy the book,  from the reviews that it was NOT the end of the series and now its not 3, not 4 but 5 books to the end. This is not okay..if it was disclosed in the beginning i could understand but it wasn't. sigh..not sure what to say, i hardly ever write reviews, this may be only the second time that i have ever written a review on amazon. I will NOT be buying this book, soley on principle and time. I will read them when they are ALL out and i will not be buying them but will borrow or get them from the Library. But i will not be buying a book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I don't know what to do! Do I buy the book now, do I wait?  UGH  There are more bad reviews than good ones! I'm soo sad because I love G & E!  Maybe I'll just re-read FSoG instead!  :)  thanks for all the feedback!

B009NY43NY|3.0|I think Sookie should have ended up with Eric Northman but not Sam. The reason she chose Sam is because he is not a vampire and is a better person than Eric and she thought he would be better for her in the long haul. But she is much more sexually attracted to Eric than Sam. Eric and Sookie have a animal attraction.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoy this series. I'm happy that I was able to play catch-up on the first seasons easily.<br />I would recommend this series to people that like science fiction, futuristic themes, aliens, and/or action/dramas.<br /><br />This series reminds me most of: the original V series, Battlestar Galactica, Jericho, and Battlefield Earth. I think this is a very well produced television show, with great writing, plot, character development, and special effects; better than a lot of movies.<br /><br />As is usual with the aliens-come-to-Earth theme, the invaders are overwhelmingly superior in every conceivable way, and yet somehow we Earthlings manage to band together, scrappy and formidable with that &#34;can-do human spirit.&#34; There are much worse ways to spend an evening than watching this.
B005LAII0I|3.0|Seller was efficient.  Movie was satisfactory.  I expected more from Roberts.  The DVD was in good shape and no complaints regarding condition.  Thank you Newtown. Mirror Mirror... I personally felt could have had more depth and melancholy.
0425263924|3.0|Oh how I wanted to love this book.  Sadly it disappointed.  There was no plot, just a lot of sex (which was super hot by the way) and rehashing of old story lines.  Characters I used to love became super annoying (Cary), story lines that aren't important are made important, and truly no plot to speak of.  I felt as if this book was a stepping stone for the next book which honestly makes this half a book.  Several story lines were started however did not go anywhere so clearly they will all play out in the 4th and 5th book.  Sadly I am not sure if I will continue on the Day band wagon.  I felt this book was not worth the money or my time since it was not complete.  I love Day's work and this disappointed.  I am not sure when the next books comes out but in the most recent trends of publishing I am guessing 10 to 13 months.  If you like the series definitely read it but go in with very open eyes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is a great game but it stopped updating after the Tokyo update but other than that it is a pretty good game.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty good game. the graphics are good and so is the story line I did think I was getting the whole game though.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|this was a surprise for my kids. they love this movie. it come with to damage and it got to my house quick.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am giving the book a 3-star review because the story itself is a decent story even though I'd like to give it 1-star just for the fact that it's NOT THE LAST BOOK!!  I'm seriously angry about the way it was left.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed that it was yet another cliff-hanger book.  The series was marketed as a trilogy and now it's evidently a 5-part series.  I started it when the first 2 books were out knowing I'd have to wait for the third book. Then the original stated publishing date of January/February 2013 was pushed back to June, 2013 when it was picked up by a publisher. (I would have waited until June, 2013 to start the series if I'd known but at the time I thought I would only have to wait a couple of months to read the last installment.)  Now I get to the end of the book and it's left off in the middle of the story again.<br /><br />So I'm going to provide a VERY brief storyline recap because quite honestly the story itself didn't move very far so there's not a lot to recap.  There's only one 'spoiler' moment and that even goes by pretty quickly. 'Entwined In You' picks up immediately after where we left off in 'Reflected In You.'  Eva has to figure out how to move forward knowing that Gideon has killed for her.  They also have to figure out how to continue their relationship given their very public breakup in 'Reflected in You' which Gideon did to protect Eva. The first 3/4 of the book treads water with Eva & Gideon sneaking around with each other trying to figure out how to publicly resume their relationship without sending up red flags with the police. While I appreciated the story it was basically an entire book of \\"filler\\" setting up books 4 & 5.  Then in the last 1/4 of the book all of sudden Megumi has a foreshadowing story-line, Cary's story completely jumps the shark, the investigation into Nathan's death goes a completely different direction leading to yet another foreshadowing of more problems for Eva & Gideon, Eva can't quite seem to get her act together when it come to Brett either (no spoiler there) and then at the very end we throw in some craziness with Gideon's mother.  WTH?!  Basically the book treads water with Gideon & Eva before quickly resolving the issue only to spend the last 1/4 of the book setting up story lines for development in Books 4 & 5.<br /><br />So..... \\"buyer-beware\\".....  For myself, I'm done with this series until it's finished.  I very rarely read serialized novels and that is exactly what this is starting to turn into. I'm not paying $9.99 for continued installments of a serialized story.  So we'll see when this story is eventually done how much the publisher wants for each 'installment' and whether I care enough about the story by then to pay that price.  I'm done.  I feel incredibly betrayed right now.  If this is how Berkley & Ms. Day are going to continue with this series then as far as I'm concerned Gideon & Eva can ride off into the sunset someday together - I just no longer need to actually read about how they got there.  Ms. Day has betrayed my trust with this book. Do NOT tell me you're writing a trilogy and then at the last minute extend it to 2 more books by lamely adding new story lines out of the blue.  I don't trust the author or the publisher at this point not to extend it even further to books 6, 7, 8, etc. if they think they can make more money out of it that way.

I'm a dude, not a gay dude, but I still think Tina Fey is a gem.<br />Reasons for not giving  it 5 stars:<br />1) although I love the bowel movement jokes this book is definitely more geared for women.<br />2) the birth parts were ickey.<br /><br />Overall this book is a laugh out loud pleasure with great insight into managing as well as the production of SNL and 30 Rock. (Even made me wanna take improve classes)
B00280LYIC|5.0|it definitely should be voted for best book ever!!!!!!!!!  IT IS THE BEST BOOK  IMPOSSIBLE TO WRITE A BETTER BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Although not usually a fan of comic-book themed movies, however this one was exceptionally well done. I finally got it here in June, after seeing Joss Whedon was the director and scriptwriter; he's one of my alltime favorite directors (thanks for Firefly, Buffy, and Dollhouse), Joss you're a brilliant visionary who genuinely 'gets it', thanks for overdelivering with this visually stunning movie. It's a genuine thrill to see the teamwork, visual fx and excitement of the battle in NYC.<br /><br />Story arcs and character development are actually engaging, unlike most comic-themed movies; I like the human touches in the Hulk character (reminds me of the original character and thx Lou for the v/o). Samuel Jackson is great as Nick Fury; always a strong leading character, one of the best actors in modern film, it's always great to see you in action.  Samuel 'brings it'... as always.  Scarlett's Natasha character was outstanding, she was one of the best characters of the film, what I especially liked was her backstory.  Great ensemble cast, they worked well together, following Joss' exceptional directing and scriptwriting.<br /><br />To the story,<br /><br />Ken
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I have to say that this album is one of the greatest music surprises I've heard in a long time. I came across twenty one pilots on yahoo one day b/c of a live concert they did. I heard \\"Guns for Hands\\" and thought, hmm that's interesting, I wonder what the rest of it sounds like? Well, it's great! These guys are amazingly talented, with an original sound that is all their own. It's a blend of rap, electronic, rock/pop that you can't find anywhere else. This album has the ability to appeal to so many different music lovers. Get it! It's worth it!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you are interested or intrigued in the field of psychology I would strongly suggest reading The Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. There is emotional conflict, struggle between characters, internal battles, and more. When the reader thinks he/she knows what the key to the think is, the author reveals something that changes everything.<br />In Fifty Shades Darker we see Christian Gray again. In the first book of the trilogy the audience really only is getting to know everyone. You meet the multi billionaire entrepreneur, Christian Gray. Ms. Anastasia Steele is the roommate of a college journalist, Kate Kavanagh, who is supposed to be interviewing Mr. Christian Gray.  As you read, you quickly learn Gray has emotional difficulties and is categorized by his family, as socially stubborn. In the first book, Fifty Shades of Gray, Christian has no friends and a limited amount of questionable relationships. He soon finds himself having an infatuation with a Ms. Anastasia Steele. Throughout this infatuation we learn that Gray has a very troubled past. He has night terrors every night; which is why he thinks he cannot sleep with anyone. He soon finds out that sleeping with Ms. Steele impedes the night's terrors. The night terrors have some deal to do with his childhood. Parasomnias are disruptive sleep disorders that can occur during arousals from REM sleep or partial arousals from non-REM sleep. Parasomnias include nightmares, night terrors, sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and many others (Chanin 2012). Night Terrors are characterized by a sudden arousal from slow wave sleep with a piercing scream or cry, accompanied by autonomic (Controlled by the part of the nervous system that regulates motor functions of the heart, lungs, etc.) and behavioral manifestations of intense fear. Also known as Pavor Nocturnus, incubus, severe autonomic discharge, sleep terror.<br />Because Christian thinks of himself as a sadist, he feels that he must control women that have a remarkable resemblance to his biological mother. Christian thinks this part of him is a disease, where as his doctor, Dr. Flynn, would disagree with him; and does often. This is shown to be more of a lifestyle choice, when Anastasia leaves Christian. When she leaves, he is completely broken emotionally. He chooses her. He chooses to leave the sadist lifestyle behind, so he can pursue a happy life with Anastasia.<br />It is assumed that his troubled emotional status is at least in part based from this past. Gray does see a behavioral therapist. Ironically this person is one of very few people in the world Gray trusts. The good Dr. accepts and even likes Christian's newest girlfriend, and encourages him to stick with her what ever it takes. There is a time in the book when the girlfriend and the Dr. meet. Dr. Flynn tells Anastasia, that he believes the relationship is a great form of behavioral therapy that he is trying on Christian. This therapy is called SFBT or solution focused brief therapy. \\"With SFBT, the  conversation is directed toward developing and achieving the client's vision of solutions.\\"<br />Christian Gray also has yet another phobia, Haphephobia (the fear of being touched). Aphephobia is the fear of being touched. People who have this fear avoid contact with people, which could relate back to sexual fears or fears they could become contaminated. People with this phobia might also have Agoraphobia (which is discussed on the home page) or Chirophobia (fear of hands). Aphephobia is considered to be a social phobia, which is discussed on the home page. Aphephobia is also known as Aphenphosmphobia, Chiraptophobia, Haphephobia and Haptephobia.<br />Anna (Anastasia) finds this phobia extra peculiar; as she wants to personally touch every inch of Christian's body and soul. She cannot understand why someone so beautiful on the inside and out can have so much hurt in their life; to the point of causing him so much heart ache and distress.<br /><br />References:<br />(1998).

B00847KFDS|5.0|I was only half interested in this CD at first. I'm always a little cautious about these celebrity pairings.<br /><br />John Fogerty is something of a legend and his songs have become iconic in the American fabric of music. The words, rhythms, and beats are so indelibly imprinted on our mass consciousness that I had doubts that they should be messed with. Well, mess with them he did! And some of these are a fine mess indeed!<br /><br />The word goes out quickly; the Foo Fighters team up with John to kick things off with Unfortunate Son in a harsh, driving way. The guitars are 60s style in-your-face. They crunch and howl in a distress that matches the traded vocals: \\"It ain't mee-eee-eee!\\"<br /><br />Going for a country ramble, Keith Urban joins Fogerty for Almost Saturday Night. The pleasant sounding banjo gives way to a more driving modern country sound. It's good but I think the original is better.<br /><br />Other country stars feature prominently on this outing as well: Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert and Brad Paisley. Zac Brown pulls off a nice cover of Bad Moon Rising.<br /><br />John contributes two originals for this project. They are both about traveling. At least metaphorically speaking. While they are fine, they won't rival the best of his stuff here. But then again, how much music ever created does do that?<br /><br />The only letdown for me was Lodi. John and his family change it from a mournful lament into a driving rock song which doesn't give it the setting it needs.<br /><br />But there are at least two cuts here that give the originals a good run for their money, if not surpassing them. Someday Never Comes with Dawes is outstanding; fully realized and sung by abandoned and abandoning men, it features John with his raspy down-home south of  Nawlins by way of California vocals nailing the chorus warning to every mother's son. As for Born on the Bayou, I think it is safe to say that he and Kid Rock put this thing up above the original! I find it hard tobelieve that I'm writing this but Rock's gritty and edgy vocal matches John Fogerty's in intensity and sheer guts! For an album to feature songs that pull off this feat is amazing to me.<br /><br />This is no museum piece; buy it and enjoy it. There is so damn little out there to enjoy these days and this release is loud and clear evidence of this!!

B006H5120E|4.0|I might have preferred the movie if it was originally released on 3D. Having seen this movie several times already, makes it difficult to sit another three hours to enjoy the 3D. I bought it out of curiousity and my enjoyment of 3D movies. But, if you have the Blue Ray version, this one need not be bought. Unless you are a 3D freak
0810988232|5.0|I must say, I don't have much experience in reading cards; I've never even had a set of my own. However, I have been a fan of Froud's work for a very long time; I found this set in beautiful condition at a local bookstore for only $2.98, so I figured if they didn't feel right to me, I didn't spend too much, so I would leave them unsmudged and sell them.<br /><br />Luckily, both the price and the cards felt very right. The artwork on each is gorgeous as ever. I see that a lot of reviewers have mentioned that the cards are a bit flimsy and that it isn't their favorite deck for any of several reasons. As it's my first deck, I can't really compare it to others, but I like it so far, and the deck resonates well with me.<br /><br />Overall I think it's good for beginners like me who want not only a nice deck, but a visually appealing one as well.

B000EOTTV8|3.0|Let me start by saying I do love this movie and love having it in my collection. It always makes me laugh, and it's interesting to see people that I'm so familiar with in different genres (Huffman in \\"Desperate Housewives\\", Zegers in tons of made-for-tv movies, and Preston from \\"True Blood\\") do an independent movie like this. There are not enough movies out there that cover a broad enough range of LGBTQ protagonists (gay and lesbian sure, but what about gender fluid, pansexual, demisexual, etc?) so it was quite interesting to see a MTF transgender woman as the main character. But I do still feel like something is missing.<br /><br />Sabrina \\"Bree\\" Osbourne (formerly Stanley Schupak) is one signature away from her final surgery, and then she will be a complete woman, physically. She has completed her real life training and is ready for the full monty when she gets an unexpected call from someone claiming to be Stanley's son in need of bail money. It turns out that Bree's ex lover is dead, leaving behind their son, Toby. When Bree mentions the incident to her psychiatrist, she withholds the signature until Bree assesses this sudden turn in her life. When she does, she finds that her son is a drug addicted prostitute, and under the guise of a churchgoer on a cross country trip, plans to drop him off with his stepfather so she can move on and get her vaginoplasty. Things become much more complicated than she planned, though, and what she thinks is going to be an easy ride is full of twists and turns.<br /><br />A lot of LGBTQ reviewers seem to find this a sub-par addition to the media in our community due to portrayal, but I personally don't see anything wrong here. Out of all the characters, only Toby and his Johns are portrayed as something other than heterosexual (bisexual and homosexual, respectively). Aside from Bree, the only other transgender characters are a bunch of happy go lucky homebodies at a Mary Kay style party, who personally seem pretty normal and not over dramatized to me.<br /><br />Still, I feel like there are almost parts missing, and the ending, while sort of happy, always kind of leaves me wanting more. The acting though, definitely makes up for it. While most of the cast is accepting of Bree's gender secret, there is still the harsh reality of the hurt people sometimes feel when you keep the secret from them (Toby) and that sometimes even people you thought loved you will never truly accept you and sometimes even distance themselves from you (Bree's parents.) All in all, it's a fun, offbeat cross country road film about what family really means, and embracing your true self, past mistakes and all.ver dramatized to me.<br /><br />Still, I feel like there are almost parts missing, and the ending, while sort of happy, always kind of leaves me wanting more.

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I used to play board mahjog with a group of ladies and, at first, thought this might be like it. It's a timed matching  game of the mahjong styled pieces of which you can choose a style for the pieces if you'd like. There are sooo many game designs to choose from that once you begin playing it becomes addicting. Try to play without hints or help  ...hard to get time below 3 minutes but it's fun trying. Game works everytime with no hitches ...have fun!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|When I first heard the song Super collider I thought this going to be another Risk but appearently it wasnt. It didnt sounds like 80's Megadeth but neither like United abominations or Endgame. That said, it contain traditional heavy metal/hardrock style and definetely a better offering compare to 13 which sounds like various era being cramped together. It's little bit like Youthanasia in a way, most of the songs has similar tempo but off course this one isnt as plain as Youthanasia.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This works well for mom. Allows me to read pdf files when I use the Kindle fire. I do not do this often, but it is great for those e-mail attachments you want to see before you decide to keep or trash.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My little one loves littlest pet shop so this game is great for her. Some of the levels get a little difficult for her because they have a lot of reading so she'll get a little frustrated. Other than that she love it. Plays it every chance she gets.
B005HSL626|5.0|Teen daughter likes this game. Hours of mindless fun. She really likes it on her Kindle fire, and also on the iPad.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|The game is a pretty typical angry bird game. I think I'm just kind of burned out on angry bird. Still a fun game.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|This was not a fun app for the Kindle Fire. I would give it zero stars if the program let me. So says my daughter, who got this for her Kindle Fire.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This game is a little fast. We've only gotten past maybe a level or two but that's it. More for boys.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Teen daughter calls this app fun-tabulous. She likes to play this game with her friends and father. Works well on her Kindle fire.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app often. I like the weather in motion feature. It's nice to see the weather as it approaches.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Teen daughter calls this game fun-tabulous. She must really like it! She plays this game a lot, and her teen brother enjoys it as well.
B005HSL626|5.0|a simple yet challenging game. its fun to try to beat your last score. its also fun to play the one with the bombs because it keeps you on your toes
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Nice gift for my son, the Dr. Who fan. Not sure if it was really meant to be used much, and has held up surprisingly well.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|i just wanted to say thanks to all the Amazon readers for all the reviews! helped me decide NOT to buy the &#34;series.&#34; Now I have an extra ten dollars!
193700788X|3.0|Well, it was not the best one of these by a long shot, but it was fun to read and get the final wrap up on the main characters that were left. I have to say it was a good &#34;good by&#34; because it did not make you long for the next installment. Yeah for Sam finally!
B005DC68NI|5.0|I got it because I am obsessed with learning about digitally publishing eBooks. I loved him talking about how he got started in self-publishing, and the reasons why a person should. It talks about the state of the publishing industry and how eBooks are taking over the market. If you go to his website there is a free PDF version of the book which is cool, and he even gives you tips on formatting your eBooks for E-readers. It has three parts the first one covers the changes the industry has been through, and some background about the self-publishing revolution.<br /> \\"Part two deals with the nuts and bolts of self-publishing. It covers everything from finding an editor, arranging a professional cover, formatting your book so it appears perfectly on every device.\\" (Gaughran) I love how it tells you all you need to know in order to make your eBook successful. It explains the various publishing platforms even suggesting you read the Smashwords style guide when formatting for it.<br />It goes in detail about uploading to amazon. It tells you about Pubit the program Barnes and Noble uses. It goes into detail about submitting to Smashwords. It talks about pricing your work which is helpful if you do the first book in a series 0.99 then pricing the second higher. It emphasizes flexibility and playing with prices. It goes over designing a website and blogs. It even explains the amazon author page with no one loving spammers.  Ways to use websites that link to your blog. Ways to gain readers and people loyal to you.<br /> It goes over how important reviews are too. It goes over Smashwords coupons, competitions, giveaways and blog tours. It even teaches you how to get through a sales slump and dealing with bad reviews. The final part 3 of this book features success stories from self-published authors.  I loved reading about the authors of ebooks and their journeys it made it entirely possible for me to dream about being successful the way they are which is why I give this bookfive stars! I loved it, and if you want to start self-publishing this is the ebook for you on getting started on it. I loved hearing about the authors starting out, and they come from many backgrounds.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Plenty of heros and heroines noir in this, literally.  Nice twist at the end, and quite a travelogue also. The main character takes us on a journey of redemption, love, faith, loyalty and hope and courage that are the finer points of faith and spirituality, regardless of what god you worship, or in this case what god you are.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Could not put it down.. did not see the ending twist coming! Would recommend this book to any reader! Looking forward to the next book  I read by this author.
B009QW85ZU|1.0|It pains me to think I spent $4.00 for this movie.  It's the worst Bond movie ever.  We had to stop watching it half way through it.
B00BU0L882|1.0|The title and description are so misleading. I thought I was getting a great horror movie. Was I wrong!  I have never seen such depravity and degredation in a film!  The SPCA and Child Welfare and a representative from Woman's Rights  and Protection should have to view the movie and take the appropriate actions. Shame on Amazon for selling such filth and the movies should be pulled from all stores. I threw away the copy I purchased. It was truly a waste of money, time, and most importantly my integrity for the small amount I watched. I rate this product a ZERO!
1455519006|5.0|Makes you think, very enjoyable, holds your attention. A great who done it, please give me more. Super author that I like very much.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited a very long while for this book. While the first one was fairly good, and the second one on par, this book was only just readable. I got more than halfway through before I put it down and had to skip to near the end, hoping it would get better: It didn't. The book has no plot, just a lot of filler characters and raunchy sex scenes(and even those get boring after you read them for 13 pages straight).<br /> While I was intrigued by Eva in the first book, in this one she just seemed flat, predictable and boring! I had hoped the ending would save it, add some closure or reason behind the lackluster characters, but nope. Not only do we not get closure, we get to wait for another 2 book releases. These books are being drawn out for the money. They just need to end.  Also, I've noticed that Sylvia Day seems to reuse her main characters in all of her books. I read Eve of Darkness (another sylvia day), and Gideon is essentially the same as Cain, annoying nickname for his love interest included. And Eva and Eve (short for Evangeline) are the same love obsessed, sex crazed, person. I understand making new characters is a difficult process, but really, if you are going to reuse them, at least TRY to make them a bit different.  Long story short, I feel like Sylvia Day is just trying to get her monies worth.<br /> My advice to you, dear reader, is to save your money. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or a library. This was the first book I've EVER had to return,and I don't regret it.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone!  It was too wierd and too long.  I kept reading until the end for the same reason people slow down to look at car wrecks.
0385343248|5.0|I read this book twenty years ago, and every so often I pull it out and get lost in it's beautiful imagery all over again.  Clavell writes lovingly, his characters richly drawn out, complex and intriguing.  This is a book about the conflict of two world colliding, a testimony to the power of loyalty and the ability for humans to adapt and survive.  Its hard to image a world where you are forever cut off from your former life by an ocean. Imagine leaving on a business trip, never to return, leaving behind your family and life forever.  Blackthorne, an English navigator finds himself washed up on unknown shores, into a culture as different as another planet.  Society and its rules are so foreign, most of his crew mates can't adapt and eventually cannot survive.  However, Blackthrorne is driven by both curiosity as well as his own driving ambition to get rich and go home.  He understands that by adapting, earning the trust of his captors, providing them with a service they don't have in their own isolated world, that not only will he live,but achieve greatness as well.  There is a love story interwoven though out the pages of the book that is tender as well as bittersweet. Beautifully written, achingly poignant, it is a timeless read about the ability of humanity to grow using its indomitable will to survive.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|If actually all this happened, then there should be reparations/compensations for the african americans and every dark-skinned persons on this globe.
B0010SEN18|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book even though it was recommended by Scott Kelby. One reviewer really panned the text with his/her disappointment that McNally didn't offer technical details of each shot. No shutter speeds, f stops, ISO  calibration. No exact lighting arrangements or varied distances between lighting. No advice on what to buy or where to get it. That reviewer wrote six or more paragraphs on what he/she didn't take away from this important text that they failed to get the most important message this book has to offer. That message is one of creativity, imagination, persistence and sometimes just plain dumb luck.<br /><br />If you the buyer/reader of Joe McNally,s book \\"The Moment It Clicks\\" are looking for technical information then you aren't ready for this book. Learning the technical aspect of photography is the easy part. Being creative with that technique is what separates the snapshooter from the photographer.<br /><br />I promise you if you read this book with your mind wide open...ready for the lessons Mr. McNally is teaching you...and you are willing to do what it takes to change your perception of photography and yourself as photographer...this will be money well spent on your photographic education.<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I did not like because it required additional steps to download.  Something that was not stated up front. I was very disappointed.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I Really love this app! Extreme variety of sound and options. Helpful in reminding me of my daily meditation goal.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Great songs, good acting, fun scenes, and a steamy romance, makes this a total package. Almost makes me want to learn to dance.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|Too emotional , sad and disturbing for me...I didn't choose to finish the book and I would not suggest this book for anyone.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|I am not a musical type guy, but this one has been a favorite since it came out. Watch this one for some good family fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|little skill needed and the games are good for a few minutes of down time I enjoyed playing all the games within this app
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Who does not love Forrest Gump? Tom Hanks does another excellent job in this timeless classic. Family friendly and fun!
B00CATSONE|4.0|It's a good read but it feels like a teaser for something else. It would have been perfect with more substance and more about Tesla's life
B002ZG97LK|2.0|If you want to see a good movie get the original, this is a lousy remake if you aSk me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A fun interactive game! Great graphics and a lot of entertaining activities. You can feed and groom your horse ride it in competitions and earn prizes. Buy more horses and different tack for extra points
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|What can I say? Tom Hanks is an awesome actor and this is no exception. I could not imagine being stranded on an island and surviving.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is awesome, nuff' said. Predicts very well and Flow is amazing. Themes look really nice also,  especially the ics themed skin.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked this book because it was a good lesson about not judging others j u st because th e y look different-  August was a strong boy to deal with people l e always staring.
0062103377|5.0|I really LOVE the series and I was devastated when Bobby died, so when I saw this book I knew I had to have it!  It is awesome to read the story from Bobby's point of view and learn the history of how he became a hunter and gathered all of his knowledge over the years.  I highly recommend this book to any Supernatural fan!
B00AHJXRS6|5.0|A friend gave me this CD in March and I INSTANTLY loved it! How much did I love it? Well, here it is only 3 months later and I now have all 5 of their CDs and managed to catch them live in Atlanta at the end of April. I also hope those of you who saw them open for Pain of Salvation right after that were paying attention because this is an OUTSTANDING band and I hope to hear LOTS more from them in the future.<br /><br />Genre-wise they are smack-dab in the middle of the Porcupine Tree/Riverside/Opeth genre of progressive metal while developing their own sound and style as well. So if you are a fan of this genre, or Dream Theater, Queensryche, or even bands as diverse as Rush and Iron Maiden, you need to get this CD ASAP.<br /><br />They changed singers before the last album, 2010's Phlegethon, and that, coupled with a change in writing style, was a great improvement over the first 3 albums. And that really seemed to come together for the writing and recording of In Crescendo because I think it is the best album I have heard so far this year. Yes even better than the new Riverside and Steven Wilson releases, it is THAT good.<br /><br />There's not a single bad song on the album, nothing that even comes close to being \\"filler\\" but, to me, the standout songs are This Ain't Another Love Song, The Hatch, The Drowning Line, and the 13 minute masterpiece of a title track!<br /><br />They also have quite a few videos on YouTube now; official videos for The Drowning Line and Morning Rain (also check out Evasion from the last album) and footage from the CD release party cut over the song Right Before. There's also an audience shot black & white of This Ain't Another Love Song from when they opened for PoS in NYC that's not bad for an audience video (most of which I can't stand and wouldn't let anywhere NEAR my stereo!)<br /><br />Bottom line......GET this CD, get it now. I wish I had of been more familiar with them 2 months ago because I would have gone to a couple more shows in addition to Atlanta. And if they come within 300 miles of me in the future.....I'll BE there!!in addition to Atlanta. And if they come within 300 miles of me in the future.....I'll BE there!!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I uploaded this app about a week ago and it works ok, but when I try to use just the mobile version, it freezes up and I have to force it closed.  It works ok when you use it in &#34;full site&#34; mode and it's a decent Facebook app.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 3 and 5 year olds love the app, but I wanted to get them to put down the ipad once and a while. Plus they enjoy legos and puzzles so I thought for $15 I would give it a try. It is exactly what I expected and wanted. My 5 year old has no trouble picking a card and duplicating the picture of the structure.she also builds her own when that gets boring. They mostly love seeing how far they can slingshot the birds, or the pigs work well for slinging too. The pieces do go flying, so don't play next to anything that can eat the pieces, or they will be lost to oblivion under the refridgerator or in the couch. I have bought at least 6 of these to give as gifts for my daughters friends. They go over well because c'mon, what kid doesn't love angry birds?
0062073192|5.0|I love the series and getting a glimpse inside the legendary &#34;journal&#34; is really cool.  Reading about the boys growing up and all of John's experiences when he first starting hunting is very entertaining.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the early beginnings.
B009X01C64|5.0|The product exceeded my expectation. Quality of the case is excellent. Easy installation. I will recommend this product to others.
0307277887|5.0|I love the series, but the books are especially great!  I would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to delve deeper into the mind of everyone's favorite serial killer!  The writing is very witty and Dexter's inner monologues are always entertaining!
B00A7W29BE|2.0|Isn't this the same as using camera to save your documents??<br />Haven't found the specialty of this app yet.<br />Got it for free though, so it's alright.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game became a pleasant little addiction quickly. I got it for my kids and tested it to see if it was any good. Now I am the one playing it and hoping my kids don't discover it and mes up my records. Great fun.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I have to say this movies(did that on purpose) can be a bit of a challenge coming into it with no warning. As the synopsis states it a handful of stories spanning 500 years. The stories tie together in the end and the point of the movies is pretty clear on what it was trying to convey. Just a note watch this movie with no disturbances or you will get lost on what is happening. The acting was superb and the backgrounds beautifully done. I'd have to say for most guys this is kind of a headache to try and take on but you can do it. Both I and my wife enjoyed it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Christina Baker Kline's novel Orphan Train is a definite must read.<br />This book set in present time as  Vivian a 91 year old woman who takes on a girl to help with her community service hours.

B0092QITO2|4.0|Colin Farrell is one of the most criticized actors in Hollywood. Some of the criticism is just, but then again, there are movies that are supposed to have deeper meaning, then there are REMAKES. Let me start my review by saying this: A REMAKE is not at all meant to be the original, though a remake may have direct connection and influence from the original a REMAKE is just what it says; the same thing just done in a different way or form. That said, you can call me crazy, but in my opinion Total Recall is a good movie. Is it perfect or award worthy? Absolutely not, but then again its not meant to be. Total Recall knows exactly what it is: A Fast paced Science fiction action flick. It DOES have the action, the intensity, and style that a movie like this needs. Colin Farrell did a good enough job as Doug Quaid or (Carl Hauser if you prefer). Then we have Jessica Biel as Melina and Kate Beckingsale as Lori( I liked her character). Ethan Hawke  makes a surprise cameo; it is brief, but nice to see him in this movie. The story line is what it is: Fast, Suspensful, and unfortunately at times predictable. But despite that, I still like Total Recall. This movie may be disliked for not being true to the original or simply disliked because people may actually just not like the movie. So I will go no further in my review and to close, Total Recall gets<br /><br />3.5 stars
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband an I spend. Quality. Time in the evening. Together doing. This game we are in our late 60 and early. 70s,

B007BFSYMS|4.0|I chose this app based on all the positive reviews and it's great. It really helps me wind down before going to sleep. Not bad for its price.

B00003CX5P|5.0|if you liked the first movies that they made, this one is a masterpiece and is one of a kind.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great informational book.  Well written providing intricate information without overpowering the reader.  Loved learning about Henrietta Lacks and her family and legacy.
0811729117|4.0|This commander of Tiger tank units in World War II was one of the more successful Panzer leaders, progressing from tank commander to company commander. Many readers will wonder how success was achieved at all, considering all the problems these soldiers suffered in dealing with Tiger tanks. If it wasn't mud, the issue was constant need of repair, inadequate roads and bridges, and just plain cantankerous machinery.
B004GYY714|5.0|Highly recommend, found several stations that consistently play music from the 50's & 60's, when I grew up and also country music that I know right away who's singing , moves me, not like like cookie cutter voices i hear today !
1475143389|5.0|The book is amazing.  I have just devoured it from cover to cover multiple times and the way it is written to the information is great.  You never get bored with it either because the chapters are short and to the point.<br /><br />More to the results of reading the book and heeding what it has to say thought, I have been cutting for about 5-6 weeks now.  I have tailored my 4 day split to what the book recommends along with tailoring my eating habits and I have lost about 13lbs so far, started around 184lbs and now at, depending on the day, 171-173lbs.  I went from a 35 in waist now down to a 31 ½ in waist.  I have gone up in weight in almost of my lifts and lastly my girly says that she noticed a huge difference in the first 2 weeks and I am just getting more solid now.  Almost everybody can see the difference, and I was not a overweight guy then.<br /><br />I have read a few other books in the past on lifting and all that jazz but this is hands down the best on I have read.  It covers basically everything you need to get started or modify your current routine.<br /><br />If you want to bulk, cut, or maintain, get this book.  It’s not even a though of why, its why not.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The best game on my kindle fire!I love the graphics and responsive controls(now if I could just play it well!)Well I'll just have to keep playing till my eyes burst!!  A must have for your FIRE! Please enjoy your self as much with this game as much as I am!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is epic but the least they could do is lower the price<br />That's how I would rate this.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|One of the best suspense thriller type drama series I've seen in a long time.  Very well written with very interesting characters and a great storyline.  Every aspect of the show is very well done.  The show's main actress, Tatiana Maslany is incredible and deserves an award for her acting.  She plays multiple characters on the show and Her ability to play them (clones) who sometimes appear together at the same time is both unique and awesome, given that they each have very distinct and different personalities.  Season 2 is supposed to be coming in the Fall of 2014.  If you enjoy a good suspense thriller, this is about as good as it gets.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon is a little softer but this is an amazing book.  I can not wait to see where they go next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought it was a great book.  Really enjoyed the storyline and found the characters to be very likeable.  Liked this book so much that once I finished I got another one of this authors books and am currently reading it.  (Sharp Objects)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just like book one this leaves you wanting more.I'm starting the next one right away. Great series. Great characters. Great story.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|One of those series where you find yourself wondering, &#34; What would life been like if I was in her shoes?&#34; I found myself living through each character as plots unfolded; And many plots there were. Each character was thoroughly developed, and each got their center stage episode. The only draw back was the sudden ending to the last season. I found that I wanted more resolution of plots, and one of the main characters was hardly seen or heard from. But while it lasted, I couldn't help but to want to watch the next episode before the one I was watching was over.
B00BS6WRPG|4.0|Jamie Cullum has always had a diverse array of musical styles that he's utilized in his work. From modern updates of standards (see \\"Singing in the Rain\\" from way back on the Twentysomething album) to classic jazz trio/quartet (\\"All At Sea\\") to pure pop (\\"Photograph\\" from Catching Tales) to big band with a modern appeal (\\"Just One of Those Things\\" from The Pursuit) to downbeat and techno, there has always been quite a variety of sounds within a Jamie Cullum album.<br /><br />What makes Momentum different is that all of these styles are blended into a complete, consistent sound. There's no real song that sticks to one genre or style. Everything is a little jazzy, a little techno, and a lot pop. There are a couple truly great classic Cullum keyboard/piano solos (in \\"Love for $ale\\" and \\"Pure Imagination\\", interestingly the two covers on the CD) but there's also a Farfisa organ solo in \\"When I Get Famous\\" that Ray Manzerak would have been proud of, and in fact the whole song could have been a cousin to the Doors' \\"Alabama Song\\". \\"Sad Sad World\\" also has a nice heavily reverbed piano solo over a dub/trip hop beat.<br /><br />Momentum also features some very nice production, from a large vocal chorus in \\"Everything You Didn't Do\\" (which, by the way, is the catchiest song I've heard in ages) to a New Orleans big band feel in introduction to \\"When I Get Famous\\" to a significant, dynamic, impressive string section in the song \\"Save Your Soul\\" , which sounds just like a song that Rhianna would have done with The Fray. The CD concludes with \\"You're Not the Only One\\" which sounds like Coldplay.<br /><br />So while this CD may turn off the jazz purists who have loved Cullum, the CD Momentum truly has a cohesive sound, with all songs but 2 written or cowritten by Jamie. And it has much of the things I look for in a CD - some serious musicianship, catchy melodies, and, at least in the first couple listens, some good lyrics. A step forward to a newer sound for Jamie and a very enjoyable CD.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I will not bash the author. Kudos to you for having the courage to write anything at all and share it with the world. I, unlike some of the other readers, knew from Facebook that the series had changed from a Trilogy to a Quintet, so I'm not upset for that reason. I was actually quite happy to get more Gideon, but after reading this book, I'll probably pass on the rest.The story was okay and I loved the writing style, but I went into Entwined expecting some of the story lines from the previous two books to wrap up, but that didn't happen. I actually don't think ONE single thing wrapped up. Story lines just kept growing and growing, and nothing got resolved. It got boring fast, not to mention slightly puzzling. The ending is technically not a cliffhanger, which some people seem to be so angry over. It does NOT leave you hanging, but it does leave you feeling unfulfilled, and quite frankly, just plain sad. Approximately forty percent of the book is sex and not just sex, but long, drawn-out, yawn-worthy sex. And yes, I know it's an erotica series, but...you'll just have to read it. When you start skimming sex scenes in an erotica book, that's a terrible thing in my opinion.
B00AB12TEI|5.0|I'm a business consultant and executive coach, and I have to tell you that I like this book. But what I really like is the approach in the book. It is simple, straightforward and well-thought out. More importantly, it is impactful. It won't tell you what your purpose is, nor what your business model should be. Nothing and no one can actually do that for you. But it is an excellent process of reflection and mapping that will very likely lead you to insights and clarity. And, if you take your courage in both hands and act on that, then more and more insights and clarity will come. I will be recommending this to clients in situations where I feel a process like this may help them, and so I am also recommending it to you if the time is ripe for you to reflect, reframe and move forward in a different way. And if you are a procrastinator, then I will also recommend the book The War of Art. It is an excellent complement to this, showing us what resistance and procrastination are, and how to overcome it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia made a \\"promise\\" to those of us that chose to join her on this journey into her storyline...a Trilogy. If she wasn't keeping it to a Trilogy, she shouldn't have said so up front; before we purchased her book.  Once she committed to a Trilogy, she owed it to those of us that bought her expensive books and stuck to the \\"promise\\" she made to her fans.<br /><br />It's just like any other relationship...trust is everything.  Boo to you Sylvia Day!
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent book. It draws you in and holds you until the end! I simply could not put this book down it is so interesting.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I was very surprised by the graphic. The colors are bright. I have a hard time putting it down. Love it on my kindle fire hd 8.9. You won't be sorry. Have fun.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I haven't read a Harlequinn in a very long time. This I liked. Remembered why I don't care to read these type of stories. Too much sex details, but it was a good read otherwise.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Entertaining. Good graphics. Great puzzles. Only withheld one star, I felt the ending wasn't as strong as it could have been.
B0032GITH0|3.0|The Lovely Bones is an intriguing story a young girl's murder I both like and dislike the author's use of detail. Personally, I don't like the portrayal of heaven in the novel. I find it strange how there are different interpretations of a person's own heaven. I understand that heaven and the people Susie meets is based on her interests, however I believe that Susie's heaven should just be Susie's.  However, compared to other novels that talk about heaven this novel elaborates more on events that happen on earth, such as grieving of a beloved one shown through Lindsey coldness towards her parents and friends.<br />Alice Sebold does a fantastic job in illustrating the process of grieving through various characters. Susie's mom portrays the isolation aspect of grief when she doesn't answer when Mr. Salmon calls her name. Mr. Salmon the denial aspect of grief when Mr. Fenerman gives him the news that Susie may be dead.  He's determined to find any clue that leads to Susie's disappearance such as Mr. Harvey's awry behavior. In addition, Lindsey represents the angry and grudge holding aspect of grieving. She becomes sassy when speaking to the principal and sees everyone else almost as hypocrites. She becomes cold as people reference her as `the dead girl's sister.' The characters that Sebold uses to portray the process of grieving, helps show the true grieving process that the reader may be able to connect to.<br />Another interesting aspect about Sebold's writing is the use of gory details to show the cruelty and savageness of Susie's death. The fact that the author uses gruesome details helps leave an impression on the reader about the evils of the world. Therefore, I give this novel a three out five stars as I like the details and representation of each character, however there are some minor details that I'm not a real fond of.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book. I love Gideon, but please everything was drawn out and story should have been completed with this book. But no.... the author has decided to drag out this story for who knows how long. I feel so disappointed with the author. Stories should come to a conclusion eventually. I don't appreciate author dragging out story so she can sell more books. I feel ripped off. I was so looking forward to this book. I thought it was going to come to a beautiful conclusion, boy was I wrong!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's your portable memory with sync technology. I would recommend for anyone.. err, correction everyone. You will love it too, believe me.
B001GMQALY|3.0|This is one of only 4 or 5 movies that I stopped viewing well before the end. The version on Amazon Prime must be different from versions seen by that those who rated it 5 stars. I had heard so much and read some over the years about how great this movie is/was. I am still trying to recall now which sexual taboos were broken? They must have edited out those scenes completely. I had much higher expectations for this movie. Yes, KB has a great body and shows it liberally, but I expected a much more compelling story. I cut my losses 30 minutes shy of the ending.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This started a little slow but the mystery was more than enough to keep me interested. I liked the way the story was told from so many  viewpoints but it did get a little confusing at times. The trick was to look at the year noted at the beginning of each chapter to remind myself which character was being followed. It is broken down between three generations and over a century time frame, not to mention three continents.<br /><br /> Overall, nicely developed characters and intriguing storyline with plenty of twists and turns. I look forward to checking out other books by this author.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I just got the update and it wont even open it sucks .  :(<br />I don't know what hapend. so don't get it.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|This book is great to read though it can't beat The Fault in Our Stars. I enjoyed reading this book though some parts I skimed though someparts of it.
1939416019|5.0|Loved the book. I totally got lost in the book and finished it in about 2 hours. i can't wait to read the others
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As has been said by others watching downton brings back so much history that is gone now. and makes one feel very Brtitish, which I am anyway, running back 400 years. the casting is fantastic and totally appropriate for the  story. I know we will watch this series over and over again.
0812550706|4.0|Great book, very interesting story line. Without spoiling anything the end gets a bit repetitive and I saw the first major plot twist coming. The last major plot twist took me by surprise though and reeled me back in to want to read the next books in the series. I forgot what quality my book was claimed, &#34;good&#34;, I believe. It was in good shape, just some blue crayon marks on the first few pages. I guess someone's kid got a hold of it. Didn't affect my reading though.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|What a joy this is to listen to. I was nervous about paying for electronic tracks instead of hard copy but it was well worth it! Amazing voice! Catchy songs!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very insightful and sad. Money, as usual, rules the roost. I already went out and bought some plants. I may go back to a big garden next year.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Probably not. I admit there are not as many great songs on this album as they've had on their previous albums, but if you're a Muse fan this album is a must have!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a definite page turner. This is a book that I will read over and over again! I truly loved this book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a wonderful tv show. The character development is well done. Overall entertaining. It's very sad that it only ran for one season. Be sure to watch the movie \\"Serenity\\" after completing the season.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Fun space opera, nothing more, nothing less, a near-complete success at what it's seeking to be. I wasn't thrilled with the relatively flat treatment of other characters in relation to the protagonist(basically, each character loves or hates her totally, with a few doing complete 180's instantly.), but Honor herself is interesting, the action is steady, and although politics plays a central role it never bogs things down.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|lost the last half bc of defects in the dvd<br />very disappointed as i needed to see this for a college class
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's a good app to use to talk to friend  and when you meet someone but don't want to give your number out lol. Kik me @ alaskakid guys only 18 and over no creeps

B006OCM0G0|5.0|I used to have this game and bakery story on my iPod which I don't have anymore. Now I have them on my kindle I'm bummed out I can't recover the games I had to start all over from the beginning :/ that's the only thing that sucks about the game. My id is alaskakid95 feel free to add me.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Aptly named, Adrenaline Mob, will compel you to seize a group of friends, run out into the street and yell at clouds! The vocals are inspired and the music pays tribute to these classics with a hint of one-upmanship! Buy this album, your speakers will thank you.
0425263924|5.0|I love Gideon and Eva. No, I love Gideon. The best Alpha male character ever. Tough yet emotional. I cannot get enough. I want to read about Gideon and Eva until they have grandchildren. I have just finished EWY and I am desperate to read the next one. I am overwhelmed with the love scenes, I just cannot believe the emotion and connection. I want more of Victor, he is hot. OMG, please dont stop Sylvia, youre the best!!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Feel good book. Ellen makes you want to smile at life. I highly recommend and look forward to reading her mother books previously written.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoy reading Steven King's work. I don't believe I'll ever read a book this long without it being his.
B004H4XLRE|4.0|My son loves it... Play with it all the time.. Carries it with him wherever we go... Races his.css all the time
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE the idea of the nether but I can't get there the creepers are EPIC and<br />I think people should make it revolutionary!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! but what would make it even more amazing, is if it had a Paris France theme! but other than that, I never really have issues with this game.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Actually, if they had developed the series after the movie- &#34;Serenity&#34;, and given River a bigger role, the series would have lasted longer.  As it was, the series was never given a chance to develop a followership before it was cancelled and the movie followed.  Anyway, the series had a lot of potential and never given the chance to develop.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Much like a fairy tale and adventure story blended with pearls of wisdom weaves together for our enjoyment. Beautifully written and a quick read.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This is a cute app for kids and kids at heart. You build your own coral reef by selecting the plants, decorations, and coral that both make it look nice and attract a wide variety of fish. Same concept as games such as tiny zoo or tiny village. There are goals to meet; however, a significant downfall is that many of the goals require in-app purchases of pearls, and there is no way around this. Meeting the goals requires the purchase of many more pearls than you can accumulate without buying them. Not as much fun for adults or kids who want to spend some free time and NOT their money.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|The Cd came quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.I hightly recomend this site for future purchases. Jewel boxes break easily. Their packaging for shipping was done with care.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|New look new weapons same fun gameplay and sweet graphics. If you have any interest in guns you owe it to yourself to get this app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and as a young kid it makes me feel as if I have a real horse. This game also helps with learning about the training and how to take care of the horses.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This Big Fish game is one where you gather building blocks by clearing the board at which point you are awarded a brick to take to the Tree of Life and assemble the village. The Tree of Life has a new version so the fun can go on and on!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An amazing game for horse lovers. Lags sometimes, almost rarely, but it doesn't really make a huge influence in the game.
B009NY43NY|3.0|i was disappointed with the way it ended.  also the story seemed to drag.  wanted more Eric and Sookie.  oh well.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is brilliant buy it you just go crazy sometimes when why oh see rare items<br />. Concluding with, buy it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|game is kewl. its just there is a lot going on at once so its a bit overwhelming.  it does take a lot of patience. and it the objects needed to find often are extremely tiny while everything else is bigger. so I give it a four.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is extremely simple to use and it doesn't sacrifice any gameplay in doing so. The interface is clear, game settings obvious, and I like the various aesthetic settings one can choose from. For example, the playing surface can change its color or texture. And the backs of the cards can be most anything, and even the font of the numbers on the card can be made larger or smaller.<br />Overall, I would recommend this app to a friend.
B0057EYACI|5.0|Any Jim Croce fan has most of his music, but if you are just new to JC, then this is the album for you.  And, the bonus tracks were great because I had never heard them before.  Recommended for any JC fan, and someone looking for how music is supposed to sound and be played.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Paris comes alive in this romanticized look at the City of Romance and some of its famous artists of the early 20th Century.  I somehow missed this movie in the theaters, but was recommended to see it after I had been to Paris for several weeks on business.  Wow.  The Paris Visitors Bureau could have easily underwritten this movie, because they visit so many famous sights around town!<br /><br />Paris is for dreamers.  Paris is for thinkers.  Paris is for artists.  Paris is for walkers. Paris is for Photographers.  Woody Allen captures all these elements into this pleasant story told through visiting American's eyes.  Woody shows us the Paris we wish we could experience without any of the grit of actual life.<br /><br />See it.
B001BIL2H0|5.0|This is an excellent release. Rock, ballads, space. The suite on side two (of original Lp) is outstanding. Just as enjoyable now as it was when released.  A keeper for sure!!  If you don't have this get it right now!  You will not regret it.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Fallen tree strikes again. Another good game that you can enjoy even if you never played the first two games.  Beautiful graphics
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Deff not long enough for the money I wouldn't buy it again if I had the chance other then that it was a ok game
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love Sylvia Day and Gideon and Eva. Literally, I have been waiting with bated breathe for this book to come out... and as steamy as Eva and Gideon are, I haven't caught my breathe yet... but the cliff hanger ending really didn't sit well for me.  On one hand, I'm thrilled their story isn't over; but this one didn't have the sense of emotional closure that I expect in order for a Day novel to feel finished. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but I'm left still wanting more to the story...
B000002LAC|4.0|Not as good as Trio 2, but still a nice album.  The three work together without trying to be heard over the others.
B0000640VO|5.0|I watched this after being in Paris for a few months.  It was fun to watch and try to pick out the various locations used for the movie.  Best out-of-the-way locale I recognized:  the Arcueil Aqueduct.  The director's narration track is really good -- he describes many of the various actors and details of the scenes.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|I almost bought this after seeing the reviews and ads, but we purchased it on-line for one viewing, and that was plenty.  The characters are all great, and I wish there had been more character development.  Cute, light film, but nothing I'd want to keep
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another book with raw emotions that just keeps you wanting more & more!!! Definitely would recommend this book to friends!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very fun to play but the stuff you can but it quit e expensive and the character tokens are really rare or there's too many But I do recommend this game!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|A universal story in a game that is fully immersive, with beautiful art and music, simple and fun game play, fantastic pacing and the perfect amount of freedom.  I bought the game after seeing it at or near the top of several \\"best of\\" lists.  I was particularly curious about the emotional response to the game described by so many reviewers.<br /><br />I played Journey through a few times offline and loved it. I then played a little bit online but didn't have any particularly special interactions.  After a few months break, I've returned to the game and have played it through several more times, exploring the levels further and playing online.  The white cloak dramatically changes the game play and feel, as does prolonged interaction with companions.  I recently completed my first journey with a companion and have since encountered companions who have guided me (with much patience) to new surprises. The game provides an absolutely lovely space for online interaction.  The inability to communicate was an inspired decision; if you actually do find ways to communicate and work together, it heightens the feelings of cooperation and kinship.<br /><br />While Journey played straight through is a short game, it is extremely rewarding to replay and explore.  I have never played a game that continued to surprise and develop different layers of meaning over so many replays (by now, about 15?).<br /><br />I played video games as a kid, but only came back to them recently, in my 30's, (after seeing someone play COD Modern Warfare 2). And while I've played some great games these past few years, Journey has been the loveliest and most meaningful.  It is also the first to make me feel the same level of wonder I experienced as a kid playing video games.  A video game that is also an experiential time machine?!<br /><br />I've been promising to lend it to friends since I got it 6 months ago, but am back online to buy a friend a copy as a gift instead.  I don't want to part with my copy any time soon and know he'll just love it.  I'm also seriously considering getting my little nephews and nieces a PS3 just for this game.<br /><br />Journey is such a special game.  I can't wait to see what That Game Company does next.  If any of you guys read this -- thank you for making Journey!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Fifty Shades of a mess. I just don't think love or making love is so complex. Sure are past shape who we are but we conform (to a certain degree). This book is beyond my understanding of what it takes for a relationship to relate and be successful. Needless to say I didn't like it very much, with that being said there were a few good moments that were tender, I also appreciated some qualities that the main male character had especially his I'm into you approach (pardun the pun) and his loyalty.
0596805888|5.0|\\"Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, Good Food\\" by Jeff Potter; O'Reilly Media<br /><br />Perhaps it should be titled \\"Cooking for Hackers,\\" for in many ways that is exactly what it is.  What you get here is a wonderful combination of science, techniques, advise, interviews, and let's not forget recipes.  But it is the approach to all of these that makes this book stand out.  It is neither a run-of-the-mill recipe book nor an all-around cookbook filled with techniques, these techniques are aimed at people who like to think about things much in the way a programmer will think about efficient code (hence the reference to Geeks).  As an example, on page 25 Jeff Potter discusses whether it is better to crack an egg on a table or the edge of a bowl.  Or how about using sugar to calibrate an oven or some thoughts on thermal conductivity and the metal pans are made out of (pages 59-60).<br /><br />The book is divided into sections based around both the elements of cooking and its science.  Moving from the tools of the kitchen through to the foods, how they work, the timing, chemicals, smells, methods of heat transfer, bacteria, etc.  It's all here, with recipes throughout.  Included as well are interviews, many interviews, and interesting!  The narrative is very readable and often humorous.  The insights are great also.  (There's a section on using 3D-printing for making molds!)<br /><br />Not everything is included.  In fact, I would have expected a section dealing with sourdough, being that it lends itself so well to a discussion of various strains of yeast and bacteria and their role in bread production.  However, owing to the fact that the book is aimed more toward the general cooking process, bread plays a rather minor role.  But then again, many things play a minor role, together, though, making a much larger edifice.  Wine pairings (discussed within an interview) is a great example of these little aspects that come together throughout the book.<br /><br />It's a fun book to read, both educational and simply enjoyable.  But for those that like to think things through a bit differently than you might get with most cooking books, then this is one you will definitely want to check out.<br /><br />http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805890.do
1781162646|5.0|Joyland consumed me, took me down into a world I can still remember outside of the novel because I lived through those times as well, and left me nostalgic and emotionally exhausted.  This book is one of Stephen King's best, a steady, haunting melody of memory and youth and innocence that was euphoric.<br /><br />Readers looking for one of King's bloodthirsty romps aren't going to get that here.  They're going to get the Stephen King that wrote Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and \\"The Body,\\" all tales that I enjoy and recommend to any reader, especially those who think that all the author produces are horror stories.<br /><br />Devin Jones, the main character, is me at 21, and I think he's a lot of the guys who grew up in the 1970s when the Vietnam War was going on, the battle of the sexes was being waged, and the world was in turmoil.  King doesn't really talk about the big issues in this novel, but you can see them in Dev is you know where to look.<br /><br />Dev is a guy who's just trying to live a quiet life, a \\"right\\" life, and find a small amount of happiness chasing his dreams.  Of course, he's chasing after the wrong girl, and yeah, a lot of us have been there too.<br /><br />The book wanders around a lot and introduces a lot of characters, but I was glad to check out the scenery and I enjoyed getting to meet all the people.  There are several familiar characters in these pages, all of them the kind of folks King generally tucks into his stories - real people with real histories that we only get glimpses of, which is like real life too.  You get the feeling that King knows a lot more about these characters than he shows here, and with his habit of bringing characters back to sprinkle into other novels, I get the feeling that we'll see some of them again.<br /><br />Of course, we won't see some of them again.  That's one of the things that King does too:  introduces us to people then tells us how they were lost along the way.  He uses a lot of introspective storytelling in this novel, but it really works, although there are some times big changes in the timeline jar.<br /><br />The crux of the book is the murder that took place in Joyland's Horror House, but that's just the linchpin that frames Dev's story.  After a bitter breakup with his college sweetheart, he's looking for something to focus his attentions on and the mysterious murdered girl whose ghost sometimes appears to Joyland patrons provides enough of a mystery to entice him - and the readers.<br /><br />It's really hard to qualify this book.  It's kind of a ghost story.  It's kind of a mystery.  It's kind of a coming of age novel.<br /><br />But it's the best kind of Stephen King novel.  I read it during a drizzly night that unraveled into the small hours of morning, the perfect time to remember those vulnerable years and to believe in things that bump ever so gently in the dark corners of the world.storytelling in this novel, but it really works, although there are some times big changes in the timeline jar.<br /><br />The crux of the book is the murder that took place in Joyland's Horror House, but that's just the linchpin that frames Dev's story.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|...You have been watching Game Of Thrones -they do follow the story line but there is enough added detail and depth that the book adds,to the story line and helps build the backstory for the series<br /><br />...You have not been watching the show -the story stands alone as an outstanding epic tale combining, challenging and crashing the honor of knights against the intrigue of the plotting lords and ladies with every thing being shadowed by the knowledge Winter is Coming--and it will be a long one<br />...You just like a well written and engrossing story story-need want/-need to escape reality for a bit -it's a great read.<br /><br />......

1623420148|5.0|A friend read Tangled and told everyone she knew to \\"read this book now!\\" I'm so glad that she did! This story is wonderful and gives you little unexpected twists that you don't see coming.<br />The best is that it's from Drew's perspective. We ladies are given a sneak peak into the male thinking! Some things that he says I even asked my hubby \\"do y'all think that?\\" And every time he said \\"Yes!\\"<br />I love to laugh and that was the most unexpected treat with this book...IT'S FUNNY! I laughed out loud so many times people thought I was crazy.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone because it's got it all...funny, educational (into the male brain), romantic, and rooting for the underdog!
B0095P33IW|3.0|Movie gave me what I wanted, a temporary escape. The movie was a little silly at times with not much depth and many parts could of been left out to allow the characters to expand. I would recommend the movie but with the advise, don't expect Oscar performances including the special effects. Follows what many Marvel comic movies are, something that tries to read like a comic book but normally is more shallow.
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|Being a huge Bonobo fan, I was very excited to hear North Borders. For those not familiar with Bonobo, I'm speaking of Simon Green, a British electronic master, musician, and producer. Now when I say electronic I don't mean techno, trance, dub stupid, or anything of the sort. To explain Simon Green's music is to place oneself on an elevator to space. The elevator is made of glass and whilst you gaze around and take everything in, Bonobo plays in the background. So essentially, Bonobo albums are space elevator music. Pretty slick.<br /><br />Northern Borders consists of excellent beats and luscious samples layered within a forest of percussion and exotic horn. The ambience of the album is truly masterful, and the tempo of the music weaves in and out of reality like a rollercoaster through a rain forest.<br /><br />Sliced in amongst the instrumental tracks are guest vocal appearances from Erykah Badu and Grey Reverend to name a few. The lyrical content from the vocal guests are classic Bonobo; utilized efficiently and effectively. The words float among the beats effortlessly, and you won't find repetitive radio friendly hooks or lowest common denominator meaning. Everything is abstract enough to put thought enough into and be a true form of art if you wish it to be. This album is on heavy rotation for me at work, car, and house, and I expect it to stay that way for quite some time. Heavily recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|First of all, how long did we have to wait to read this part after the second book?? I was hoping that in this book the characters would have some type of closure. Seeing as all the books were FULL of events I don not think we need yet another book with more unbelievable story lines and unbelievable characters. I think that sometimes less is more. I honestly do not know if I would even want to read another part after this let down.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|If you're buying this book for steamy sex scenes, then go ahead.  This book is filled with them, and I doubt you'll be disappointed.  If you're looking for plot head elsewhere.  This book is pretty much empty.  Like others, I was really disappointed with Eva in this book.  It was bad enough that she kissed Brett in the last book, but in this one ---inviting him into her apartment?  Still feeling intense sexual attraction for him?  Agreeing to meet up with him in San Diego?  Just not completely shutting him down in general?  I don't like her anymore, and I don't think she deserves a love like Gideon offers her.  I LOVED the first book.  It's my favorite ever for this genre.  I almost stopped reading the second book when she cheated on Gideon.  This (third book) is too much.  Not sure if I'll be back for the last two.
0385341008|5.0|Enough people have given synopsis so I will just say why this book hits so deeply for me.  You actually feel like you get to know these characters and fall in love with them like Juliet does.  This is a book I read at least once a year when I want to \\"go visit my friends in Guernsey.\\"<br /><br />Do yourself a favor - read this book.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|An impressive continuation of the Honor Harrington story. I hadn't though it possible to better the Basilisk novel, but well done David Weber. If you like a thundering good yarn, this is it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Yes, the book ended rather abruptly, but so did the other (IMO).  Just knowing that their story will continue, make me ecstatic!!
B00BEXB18M|4.0|The morning of the release, I logged on to Amazon to see the early reviews, and was dismayed to see the negative reviews of this album. As a Megadeth fan since Killing..., and one who has all their albums, I was getting it anyway. I mean, I love Death Magnetic by that other band who averages a new release a decade, so reviews don't sway me. But I went into this expecting a shark jump, and this is so far from that. All the songs are solid. This may not be all out in your face speed metal, but it is a good album and it is pretty much what I expected. Solid riffs, cool solos, a solid metal album. Its Megadeth.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is fun. However the spending money to expand or get better buildings is a downer but if u work at it it can be done
B0053F03MM|4.0|Don't get too caught up in the details.  The military found some means of time travel.  The major limitation seems to be that the subject can only observe the recent past but not change it.  Of course, identifying a nuclear terrorist is their top priority.  It manages to build suspense without repeating too many of the same details and it also gives a sense that this process will only work a limited number of times.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham hasn't missed yet.  His books are easy & enjoyable to read.  I would definitely recommend for anyone to read.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I waited so long for this book to come out just to have a cliff hanger ending!!!  So frustrated.  I can't believe that the author is extending the ending to another book....money driven???
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have been looking forward to reading this (LAST) book in the series for quite some time now, I had reminders on the phone, on notes, computer and so on (I'm kind of confused some times). So happily on my lunch break I wander in on Amazon to by it, I then discover the _extremely_ bad reviews and I'm kind of surprised because normally this isn't the case when it comes to Ms Day's books.<br /><br />And now I pissed!! No way in hell am I going to by this for almost 14$ and then another and then YET another. No, no, no, no. I really don't care if this book is any good or not because that's not the point right now, as a writer you just don't change course on the (!) promised last book and decide to ad two more books. You just don't! I rather wait and borrow it from the library than giving this writer any more of my money.<br /><br />So thanks so far Ms Day, I did enjoy the first books but now I'm done. Sooo, so done.<br /><br />Edit: I was just mad and cranky and forgot to mention that I _did_ read it and it was a looong couple of hours and I´m just mad. It was just a long string of unnecessary conflicts and side tracks that didn´t ad a bit to the overall story. The writer just decided that she wanted more money - decided to ad two more books in the trilogy (!!!) and that did show in the story.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Not as hilarious as the movie critic thinks but a  fun movie anyway.  Both main actors were good. Some parts weren't needed.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder introduces us to August (\\"Auggie\\"), a 10 year-old boy who is born with a horribly disfigured face.  Homeschooled his whole life, his parents finally make the decision to send Auggie to 5th grade in the local public school.  What follows is an incredible story of family, friendship, and the triumph of humanity and kindness.<br /><br />Every now and then, a book moves me.  Wonder is that kind of book - the kind where you run into other parents in the school yard, you chat with your children's teachers, you call up your friends and family with kids and say:  YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK.  Everyone should read this book.  No, wait... every middle grade school should read this book.  It should be part of middle grade curriculum.  No, everyone should read this book.  There's a lesson here for everyone.<br /><br />Auggie is one of the most endearing main characters I have run across in a very long time.  As he is introduced, we do not know exactly what is wrong with Auggie or why.  This is what the author does so well, in revealing his disfigurement, providing only small glimpses so that we get to know the real Auggie before we can only see him as horribly disfigured.  Of course, we have that luxury as readers, but those who would encounter Auggie in person would see his disfigurement right away; thus, as readers, we have a very different experience in getting to know Auggie.<br /><br />Based on what we know about bullying in schools, we would anticipate that a child like Auggie would be a magnet to being abused, mocked, or excluded.  This DOES happen, but what is so beautiful is that there are many other children who look past Auggie's \\"face\\" and see what a \\"wonder\\"-ful person he is on the inside - something we see as readers all along.  Additionally, these children go a step further to stand up to the bully and choose their own path.  This is so well done!<br /><br />And then there is Mr. Browne, the English teacher, and his precepts.  Each month the children are giving a precept (i.e., \\"motto\\", \\"quote\\", etc.) to ponder and write an essay about.  While there are many noteworthy ones I can highlight, it is the first that is the most poignant:<br /><br />  \\"WHEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING RIGHT OR BEING KIND, CHOOSE KIND\\"<br /><br />I just about had a heart attack when I read that!  I have been living by those EXACT words for 20 years after I first encountered a similar quote in the 1950′s movie Harvey starring Jimmy Stewart (by the way, there are many, many fabulous quotes in that movie).  This is the quote from the movie:<br /><br />  \\"Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, 'In this world, Elwood, you must be' - she always called me Elwood - 'In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant.' Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me.<br /><br />Same idea right?!  So, although there are other equally relevant precepts, this is the one that will stay with the reader because it is so simple:  We can choose kind.  As I was reading through the book, I was thinking to myself, \\"This is not going to end well.\\"  I was oh-so-wrong and I can say that at the end, tears streaming down my face I felt HOPE that if just given the words, given the options, children CAN choose kind.<br /><br />I honestly can't rave enough about this book.<br /><br />One note however ... my 10 year-old daughter read this book as well.  She did enjoy it, but I really sensed that it underwhelmed her.  I think that at her age, there is an expectation that a book is purely entertaining.  That is, books should be filled with fantasy, magic, adventure, alternate realities, and so on.  This is not THAT kind of book.  This is REAL.  This is a book that elicits 101 great discussions and that is why I think it she wasn't over-the-moon about it the same way I was.  I still think it should be required reading in school.ving a precept (i.e., \\"motto\\", \\"quote\\", etc.) to ponder and write an essay about.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Only downside? Too short. Can't wait to see what the next chapter brings! Very addictive and makes you think. Definitely will be recommending this!
B00632HWOG|3.0|It's a pretty straight forward app. Nothing special about it. It doesnt update as often as i would like it to though
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Usually takes me months to finish a book...finished this one in just 3 days.  The only negative...you realize just how boring your desk job is compared to that of a Navy Seal.
0143118757|5.0|As a civil mediator, I found this book to very effective and educational. It is even great for those people looking to learn how to win an argument with their significant other. :)
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Lots of guessing of the plot and good acting. Interesting characters.  Seen this movie a few times.  Check it out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|as it says in the title its da best game ever!!! its Soooooo fun and u don't need wi fi to use it also its sorta like temple run but only better since u don't have to tilt!! GET THIS GAME YOU WILL LOVE IT (ITS FREE!!!)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Pandemonium builds upon the great start in Delirium with a great mixture of well-thought out plot, real character development, and deeper delving into the powerful theme.  I especially liked the switching between the \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" chapters.  This accomplished two things.  It ensured that there were not too many pages of consecutive 'background', often switching between important background in one time-setting to action in the other.  The author also used this masterfully to provide the reader the information they needed when they needed it, rather than too far back that they wouldn't remember.  It was a very well executed delivery method and helped the story build to its climax.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game! I can't stop playing it. It's way better than i anticipated it to be. I highly reccomend!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so happy this morning when I saw Entwinded with You, on my Kindle. I pushed back my TBR list and snuggled down and started to read. I was about 100 pages in when I decided that I was so bored with this book. It's just so bad. I ended up flipping to the back to see if it got any better. It didn't!!! Now I have read that the story was going to be a 5 part book. Just let it go already. Find something else to write about. Give Eva and Gideon their happy ever after and be done with it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This chapter after chapter of \\"you\\" then \\"me\\" does nothing to prevent this novel from inducing yawns.  It was one of the few books I have read that I could call a page-turner (without reading them).  If you enjoy reading about other people's real or imagined dilemmas this might keep you awake.  I cannot recommend it.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I Love Facebook but this app is quite different then the one I have on my Samsung Galaxy S2....the app on my phone comes from Google play store and this one from Amazon, I never thought the same item in this case Facebook could be so different from one carrier to the next. This app has it's quirks when you tap on something and and then  try to go back to where you just were it won't let you, it brings you back to the beginning NOT where you just were Greenwich to me is QUITE annoying....
B00785P2QC|4.0|This free game is great at wasting time. I enjoy the concept of creating a city and watching it thrive.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|YA Dystopian is one of the current \\"in things\\", just as YA Paranormal Romance was a few years ago.  Because of this, there is a lot of volume, but must of it with questionable quality.  This is not one of those books.  Delirium, during any trend, would stand out as a quality YA Dystopian.<br /><br />Writing Style: The author produces an intelligent, well-paced first person narrative that balances well the important inner monologue and the external detail to move the plot forward.  Most importantly, she creates a very likable character.<br /><br />Dystopian Theme: The theme of love being a disease is strong and creative.  The author does a great job of envisioning and implementing how this change would impact every aspect of society.<br /><br />Romance: While more a Dystopian with Romantic elements, the relationship is believable and helps move the plot along.  They are a couple the reader will root for.<br /><br />In summary, Delirium should be added as a must-read of every \\"YA Distopian\\" list.  In comparison, I would probably give both The Hunger Games and Divergent, other popular YA Dystopians, a slight edge over Delirium, if only because of their even more thought-provoking themes, but this book falls very closely behind them and is a solid FIVE.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It does exactly what I needed it to do. Quick and simple and the white noise is an awesome addition for someone like me who needs the background noise!
B00CFA222M|1.0|From beginning to end this classic fairy tale never delivers. Much of the story breaks apart with the start of many sub plots and elements of the original tale but are never tied back into the main plot. If all you want are young pretty people to look for an hour this movie is for you but forget it if you want acting or, heaven forbid, a cohesive story.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My 10 yr old daughter loves this game.<br />Too technical for my 6 yr old son, but he still tries. It's the idea of having his own dinosaurs that he loves.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I Love this app, I have a very hard time falling asleep with OUT some kind of sound and the choices this app give you are great...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It is fun to try to create combinations of sounds that meet my desires for a background. It is great to be<br />able to adjust the audio levels to make the right combos. Some of the music looping is a bit awkward<br />and it would be nice to have a bit longer selection in the loop. Most of the sounds are excellent. I personally<br />like the nature sounds best.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Thematically, Requiem is a fine conclusion to Delirium trilogy, not repeating the mistake of Mockingjay (by not making a strong argument on the main theme).<br /><br />What stops this from being a FIVE are the incomplete threads from a plot and character perspective.<br /><br />PLOT: Where the book ends might be the end of the beginning, or perhaps the beginning of the end but doesn't clearly state the long-term impact on the society.  Even an epilogue would have handled this and closed those threads.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: The author created characters that we care about, created characters whose relationships we care about, yet did not close the threads on how things ended up, even short term.  This leaves the reader wanting more and is something that another few chapters would have easily resolved.<br /><br />That said, it is still a well written and enjoyable book that delivers as a conclusion to a Dystopian Trilogy.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Forgotton about John Puller was Baldacci's first book I read, and I intend to go back and read the first of that duo.  However, I really connected with the characters and the story of the Innocent with Will Robbie as his first book.  The characters are quite likeable and well done and and the writing style of Baldacci is excellent in this book.  He sure can ramp up the tension.<br />Suspecting the guilty party half way through the book certainly did not take away from the story at all.  Other than a bit of a slow fifty plus pages at the beginning, the book takes off big time.<br />It sure kept me turning the pages.  Cannot wait to get his second, The Hit, with Will Robbie.  Hope it too is up to this writing.  Great for the suspense, thriller reader.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This author knows her subject and relays it in a meaningful way -- sure to inspire you to declutter and downsize your life style.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My kids are addicted to this game. There's more features that keep them hooked. From the added game play & features to the improved graphics.
B009157BWU|5.0|What can I say about this movie.  &#34;I LOVED IT&#34;<br />All ages will love this movie from the kids up to the grand parents!!!
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|The play is like those old video games that I loved to hate because I couldn't ever get anywhere.<br />This one I can start or stop when I want because I didn't put in coin(s). The objects streaming down<br />the screen have great motion. Sometime I actually do get to a higher level than I used to.<br />It's a fun one!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|It's an easy game and fun. My 5 year old daughter loves this game. It's a quick way to pass the time and enjoyable
0425263991|5.0|Just finished Heart of Obsidian by Nalini Singh.<br /><br />Wow! What an EPIC book!  The action was explosive and the romance flamable. lol I FINALLY got to know Kaleb! I have been facinated by him since his first scene and FINALLY i got my wish. And WOW we get to know who the Ghost is. I won't share because I am sure others won't want that spoiled so quickly. But I will say that I am not suprised when it is revealed just who the Ghost is. But the ending, thats what shocked me the most! It is truely a new era for the Psy/Changling universe.<br /><br />The only small issues I had with the book was Sahara's powers and her rapid recovery. Her powers were endlessly talked about and mentioned as being a game changing all powerful thing but it wasn't until nearly the end that we actually find out what they were. And though they were good, I didn't really think that they were as scary as they were made out to be.<br /><br />Her recovery was somewhat unrealistic to me. One minute she is broken and damaged then in the time it took for Kaleb to communicate with one of his allies she is better. It seemed too quick. Even with the explination of the Labrinth and how it was protecting her. What saved it from being too unrealistic was her memory taking so long to come back. If that had happened too quickly it would have really taken away from the story instead of adding to it.
111846446X|4.0|This book gives a good introduction to Linux and to some of the utilities and usage modes available<br />for Linux on the Raspberry Pi.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Overall the game is fun. once you get used to the controls & operation. If the functionality of game play was simpler, it would be more enjoyable. But the numerous steps involved with conducting any task removes some of the enjoyment. My kids still enjoy it.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|This deluxe edition was well worth the money.  This is Ga Ga at her finest.  I have almost worn it out listening to it!
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|The game wasn't easy to maneuver the 'copter. There was no hint as to what to aim for. I was happy I didn't have to pay for it.
B000RHKARO|5.0|This CD collection, which includes bonus tracks replaced a long lost vinyl album which carved it's way into my musical DNA. While Mayall's vocal may seem with hindsight to be be an acquired taste, his authority to bring a four piece band together to record his &#34;Holiday in LA&#34; diary leaves few doubts about how the Bluesbreakers evolved. Recorded while Mick Taylor was still 19 years old and before the job offer from the Stones, it displays the confidence and space Mayall was prepared to give MT on his third studio outing with him. Mark the intro to &#34;The Bear&#34; and outro on &#34;First Time Alone&#34; as indicators as to why Taylor finally left the Rolling Stones. A very different album from it's predecessor &#34;Bare Wires,&#34; which merits investigation as well. Though in that case I still have the vinyl which gave me my first introduction to &#34;jazz-rock&#34; via the Blues.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My alarm clock of 15 years finally broke and I was panicked.  I found this and have been really pleased.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I don't know if QOTSA are capable of making a bad album. ...Like Clockwork doesn't disappoint. Homme's Midas touch is all over every track on this one. Whether his projects are with UNKLE, Them Crooked Vultures, The Desert Sessions, Kyuss, or his many other musical endeavours, he always delivers. This kind of band is a rarity, a rarity with a musical savvy Regular John.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great game and its a lot better then temple run there is a lot more to do and there's a lot of fun characters.
125000098X|5.0|When will the next one be out...the stories are great.  One of my favorite books is also by Jeffrey Archer - Not a penny more, not a penny less!!!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Have a friend that uses it every Monday morning. She likes the way it 'holds' the totals, numbers on screen. Most like a 'paper' tape calculator there is. Useful because need to see the numbers added/subtracted/etc. and then the totals.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Downloaded when it was the free app of the day. I listen to it while working to relax and concentrate. The ability to mix sounds is really cool. The only complaint I have is that the ability to set individual volumes is a one time thing unless you reset them all and click on them again. It should really be dynamic and allow for you to change at any time by bringing up a list of currently playing sounds... unless I've missed something.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would be able to get through the whole book but I think Jaycee wrote very well.  While her story was so sad at times I also admire her strength throughout the 18 years she was held captive.<br />I loved her in the end.. Best of luck to Jaycee and her girls.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|First of, Settlers of Catan. The game itself is a great strategy game that is addicting. It is also a necessary buy for any board game families! You will not regret it!<br /><br />Second, this version of Settlers of Catan. The art is different, dare I say updated. It is a beautiful sturdy set. I love the new ocean pieces as it helps keep the board together, which is especially handy during rambunctious games.<br /><br />SO....<br />If you've never played Catan before: BUY IT, and you're welcome! ;) It is a great game!<br /><br />If you are already a fan and are wondering about this version: It's a great version, a little different, but great. The art is a beautiful update and the ocean sides are a def. improvement.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I gave this to my husband, for our ten year Anniversary. He loved it and gets compliments wherever he goes.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's first LP , \\"Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd\\" is full of Southern Rock nuances. This is evidenced once you liaten to the CD's very first track - a rockin', down-home number titled \\"I Ain't The One\\". The band doesn't ususally like to look back or rest on it's laurels musically, which is the case with the bluesy pulsations that run through the lamentious \\"Tuesday's Gone\\". Skynyrd really knows how to tell a story, especially if those stories relate to real-life situations, as is the case in songs like \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", which suddenly finds the song's narrator in hot water with an antagonist. If you haven't heard this one up close & personal, it's worth another listen or two. Good advice is found on this fine disc containing a bountiful harvest of songs in the affectionate \\"Simple Man\\". Skynyrd runs the gamut of mellowness to outright jamming, so virtually everyone who not only likes Southern Rock will find something to enjoy here. The aptly titled \\"Free Bird\\" closes out the eight original tracks in fine fashion. With a song of grand anthemic proportions, it is only appropriate that the band put this on the disc last. The five bonus tracks are a delight to the ears as well, featuring studio demos & live versions of excellent songs. Make sure you add \\"Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd\\" to your musical library, as it's a must-have for all Skynyrd & fans of Southern Rock!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Though it does sorta work, the alarm portion has never gone off...If I'm reading or using my Kendle at the time it is supposed to go off I can see the alarm message, but the sound portion doesn't work.  I've checked my settings on the Kendle and everything is set for sound so I don't know what the problem is...if anyone can help I would appreciate it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Unbroken & A Higher Call are up there on my favorite books. I read this quickly because you could get right in the cockpits in feelings.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this show for its savvy sophisticated plots that are also relevant to today's issues.  I'm wondering why season 4 isn't available.
B0002XMF5S|5.0|Awesome. Not much of an Ozzy fan? Me neither. This is for YOU/ us! Excellent guitar work, vocals are out of this world and well organized musically.<br />Enough Iron man....More SEVENTH STAR!<br />GET IT!
B00B10DZQE|5.0|Good movie, enjoyed watching with my son. Lots of good action and surfing. Ended up buying movie on AZ instant.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is absolutely awesome; I have recommended it to several people.  I enjoy the concept of this being set in the not-to-distant future.  The universe this is established in feels like it is not too far from the possible future. The main character is relatable and it feels as if his actions are realistic and logical.  The game that kicks off the storyline feels like something that most people I know would want to take part in.  The eighties references were a lot of fun to recall and nod my head to.  I kinda feel like I want to look up the songs mentioned on Pandora or Grooveshark so I can hear them again with a fresh perspective.  The 'bad guys' in this story are really bad and the good guys are people that you seriously want to root for.
B005UG542S|5.0|I read all the books and loved them then I got all the movies love them also. I even bought the movies for my kids
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Fun game worth purchasing. I enjoy looking for the items that are hidden. I like the sound affects. Don't regret getting it.
B001RNO79E|5.0|Some &#34;wearing in&#34; time was required to soften up the solid construction. After about 2 weeks the wider toe fit is great.<br />I previously purchased  the Riva mesh shoe - a more flexible softer construction but not waterproof and not as city-friendly as this leather shoe.<br />I has had previous excellent performance from Vibram soles in other hiking boots although I also own  Teva Verdon shoes without these soles which are just as good.<br />Teva shoes have &#34;forced&#34; me to to &#34;donate&#34; other junk shoes.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This show starts a little slow, but once you get emotionally vested in the characters it is absolutely fantastic. It feels like a more intelligent version of 24 with infinitely more character development. This has quickly become one of my favorite shows.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you're into action and running it's great for you. The picture of it isn't a big part of the game. The point of the game is you are this guy who stole an idol (the picture) and you got caught, so you're running for your life. Oh BTW a freak giant monster is chasing you. If you only like feel-good games don't even bother getting it ;)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am a grown adult and it is almost embarrassing how I started reading this novel.  I was waiting for my then twelve year old to leave her tutoring session and there was a crate of books for the middle school students to choose from to read.  This novel was on the very top and I grabbed it in an effort to merely pass the time. From the very first page of the paperback novel I was hooked.  To the point where I made my daughter wait for me so I could write the author's name and the title of this book down.  That very night I purchased this story on kindle and I loved it. In fact, I have re-read it more than once.  I for one, enjoyed the dialogue between the children, I was thrilled by the mock-fight scenes, I felt for Ender when he was being bullied and harassed by the school staff and felt the sadness he described when he was trying to re-connect with his sister.  To be honest though, I was not always engaged in the sections that described what was going on back at earth between his older brother and his sister.  I hear that there is going to be a movie adaptation of this story and I am very excited to see it.  I know the children in this story are young but that did not take anything away from the story for me - I believe some children are capable of great things when they are given no choice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was a really original story,I enjoyed the layout. I had a few questions when it was over, but what good book doesn't leave you with a few? It was good in the beginning, slowed a little, then the final 3/5ths was a hectic can't stop, can't put this down pace. I was really afraid everybody worth following was going to die the way it started. I kept trying to guess what was going to happen next,I never did. I think those are two aspects of the book I liked most, it was original and it was never predictable.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Lots of fun great way to clear your head after a busy day or just for a change of pace
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed in this novel. I love this series, but the ending seemed a little to rushed to tie up loose ends. The resolutions seemed too simplistic compared to the prior predicaments faced by our beloved characters in previous installments.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Gritty crime drama, much better than I anticipated. I was afraid this movie would spend all of its time developing an anti-pharmaceutical, anti-corporation  political agenda but it did not. It stays focused on the story and it turns out to be quite a story.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I was introduced to &#34;The Piano Guys&#34; by my daughter.  I am have now bought it for my young grandchildren and their parents.  Everyone is hooked!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia Day, trilogy means 3 part series...not 4 or 5. I can't believe I waited this long for such a crappy continuation which should've been the conclusion. Did you run out of ideas because it really seemed as if you were pulling ideas left and right without much thought to its development. i mean the Russian Mob? Talk about out of nowhere! I literally LOL'd with that one.<br /><br />Majority of the book was either focused on Eva having lunch or drinks with so and so or having kinky sex with Gideon which by the way i think you went over board and quite repetitive with. Were you watching a porn and simply writing down what you saw? Book 1 and 2 already covered the intense sexual relationship between E&G. Book 3, which should have been the final book, should have had more substance to their relationship other than kinky sex and secret elopement. Nope! I was not feeling the relationship between E&G. It's like it went from deep and meaningful with such promise to shallow x-rated porn.<br /><br />So I'm assuming book 4 will have something to do with Megumi's sudden disappearance which btw NO ONE CARES ABOUT! She's supposed to be a filler a/o comic relief, NOT a main character.<br /><br />But whatever! It's your story. Just know that book 3 sucked donkey balls and it seems like majority would agree with me. This story is done and buried to me. Waste of money! Waste of time!
B000U6BT40|4.0|Eureka is great show. I love that they use technology that is emerging. The unforeseen interactions and impacts are what make the show interesting and entertaining.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|cool game. really addictive . I recommend this game to anyone who likes racing games or just something you can pick up and play.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I, like many others, pre-ordered what was billed as the third and final book in the Crossfire series. I was happy to see it pop up on my Kindle this morning and finally sat down to start reading. About 15 minutes in, my dissatisfaction with the enfolding story started creeping in.<br />Is Eva even more emptionally retarded then in the first two books? Check.<br />Is the author building up minor character plotlines for filler? Check.<br />Are love scenes seemingly more of the same-old, same-old variety? Check. (I mean how often can the H/h have soul-searing sex before the reader becomes burnt out? Color me done.)<br />Do I feel like I've read this story three times over? Check.<br /><br />I decided to see if others were feeling the same and came here to check out the reviews - low and behold, there were tons of 1-star reviews AND the added \\"heads up\\" that Sylvia Day is stretching this beaten horse into FIVE books. Ummm, no thank you.<br /><br />At 16% read, I returned Entwined with You for a full refund under \\"unwanted.\\" Which is a first for me. And I wasn't even tempted to skip through the book or read the \\"ending.\\" Such a shame...
1118109791|5.0|Comprehensive review from the makers of the test, I would definitely recommend this book even if you're using another program to study. Comes with test taking tips and plenty of practice problems, as well as an initial practice test to identify your weaknesses.
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|You state a price of $59.99 but when added to my wish list now the price is $99.00 and some change. No Thankyou
0788812408|5.0|this was advertised as &#34;new&#34;...seriously, it really was cellophane wrapped and had all the coupons in it that expired in 1998!  and it plays straight through with no troubles.  the kids love this one and since it hasnt been released in a while, it is not easy to find, even used.  this fit the bill and my 4 yr old daughter approves.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Nice flash. Great with the camera I purchased for my son. He seems to love the product, and uses it allot.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Great versatility of the actors. Very long 3 hour movie.  More like a group of short stories tied together by character timelines.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I liked it before the update and now love it even more with lots of cool extras all in one swipe.  Great news videos and articles of current events. Love the outdoor sports grading, pollen watch, barometric pressure readings, etc.
0425263924|1.0|Thanks to the honest reviewers out there, I won't be wasting my one-clicks on this series. Shame on this author for promoting these books as a trilogy only to pull a bait & switch.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a book that every bit and girl will need to read<br />You v won't put the book down
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I ordered this to finish my reading goal in time. But right when i got it, it had about 470 pages. I got so mad and couldn't finish my goal. NEXT TIME RIGHT THE CORRECT NUMBER OF PAGES PEOPLE!!!
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I love this CD, the lyrics, the vocals...this is definitely the best release this year 2013 out of anything. Too bad it's not released in the USA. It's a feel good album to cruise to or chill at home. I highly recommend it.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|First, you have to like Barbra Streisand. and then you have to like Mandy Patinkin. I DO!<br />You have to like women's issues, and understand what it is to be a Jewish woman in a male dominated culture<br />(which hasn't changed AT ALL since Moses crossed the Red Sea).<br /><br />Even if you don't have any of this going on, it's likely you will still appreciate this wonderful tale by Singer, the wonderful writer he was. This really brings to life the struggles women go through not just then, but also NOW. In Israel and elsewhere(been there, done that).<br /><br />I think it's important to keep in mind that the biggest &#34;women's libbers&#34; are Jewish, and there's a reason.<br /><br />Make up your own mind about all that, but don't miss this DVD. It's worth having, it's worth watching more than once.<br />and it's worth opening your mind, even if it takes a can opener! Give it a try. It won't &#34;HURT&#34;!
B0091REZMW|2.0|Game will no longer start. The first couple times it did this I could turn off Kindle and restart. That no longer works. It starts to load, then goes black, then I get the message that &quot;mystery manor is not responding&quot; then my only option is to wait or close. This sucks because I was enjoying the game and advancing. :( please fix!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|First of all, blu-ray quality of this digitally restored edition is above all praise! I am very happy!<br />And the film itself doesn't need commentary: it is simply the best of all Pride & Prejudice versions ever filmed, in my opinion.<br />I recently saw 2005 Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley and it doesn't come anywhere close. Colin Firth is the best Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is brilliant as Lizzie. And virtually all dialogues are exactly as they are in the novel. I also found extras interesting, telling about how the film was created & received. This is simply a masterpiece!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Here we go with the 14th Megadeth's CD : well, i must admit it, on the first listen i was very disappointed, i thought it was much worse than Th1rt3en and maybe at the same level of United Abominations, which is a good album.<br />But, with Super Collider you won't get it right on the first listen : it's not that kind of album that you immediately like such as Endgame, Rust in Peace etc, you have to listen the CD a few times.<br />Overall there are a few very strong tracks such as Don't Turn your backs, Kingmaker, Dance in The Rain which, in my opinion are at the same levels of tracks contained in Endgame or Th1rt3en.<br />In the end it's a good album and for sure it's much better than Risk and Others Megadeth's albums....<br />Support the band, it's just the first CD with the new label<br />\m/
B000FC146C|5.0|Amazing!!!! This book was written a decade before I was born and it has been by far the best novel I've ever read!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really like to play hill climb racing a lot.  If it never come out I wouldn't know what GAME to play because this game is awesome and my other games are not really cool like hill climb racing.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I saw Craig Ferguson interviewing some of the people who did the voice-overs for this. and of course Craig himself is one of the voice-over characters. I highly recommend this if you want light-hearted, well meaning characters who are maybe just slightly mis-led in their thinking (sounds like Craig himself, God love him!!!), there's a funny, awkward, could go really bad-sort of conflict. and then a happy resolution, with several sub-plots.....I GOT A KICK OUT OF IT!!  It is delightful, funny, and did I say light hearted?<br />You understand this is probably a &#34;chic flick&#34; and fits into the &#34; whimsical&#34; category. But it's fun!<br /><br />If you're a snob, or like Craig says, &#34;the troll that lives under the bridge&#34; don't get it. It might make you laugh, and you might<br />not want to do that!!!!!!<br /><br />If you need a good laugh, you like Celtic things, and you're looking for something to entertain you, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND<br />IT.<br />Disclaimer:  You might not like it if you are a Scottish male, and you're REALLY impressed with yourself, and believe all of<br />your own &#34;press&#34; releases about yourself!!!! LOL!!!!
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Love this series!!! Book 3 is his best one yet! Book 4 was a bit boring since most of the major characters weren't mention but it was still a great read!! I'm off to buy book 5!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesomeee....just curious to know when are we getting d next update on this app..? But so far the experience is too good...
0307279189|5.0|My girlfriend got me to read this book, and I didn't know what to expect. To be honest, I wasn't all that interested, but she loved it. I gave it a try and to my surprise, I found it very inspiring, and it got me more motivated to run more than I've had in the past. I was running before, but now I find more joy in it. There's a lot of talk int he book about barefoot running, and fixing your stride, and chia seeds and random things. Take whatever you want out of this book, you don't have to listen to everything it says, this book means different things to different people. For me, it reminds me how lucky it is for me to be able to run, and how natural it feels.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Picked this up while walking through B&N. I couldn't put it down...<br />I did have to put it down however when I went to the rest room. At which point my wife picked up the book.  By the time I returned (which was swiftly) wifey had bought it on her kindle (it was cheaper).<br />Fast forward 27.5 hours and I'm done reading it for the first time. I would strongly recommend. To anyone. Ever.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|Interesting movie.  I saw it on TV and decided to order it because it was interesting and I thought my grandaughter would enjoy it.  A modern day take on Beauty and the Beast.  There is no nudity but it does contain some modern day issues such as drugs and bullying.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use this begrudgingly because many colleagues use it as well. That said, for the kindle, if you make the mistake as I did of opening an app associated with a tv show, it will open a chain of pop ups that will not bring you back to the app itself and will force you to uninstall and reinstall it. Other than that it's okay I guess.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|But I admit I order them and watch them- just for fun and romance I guess!  If you are prone to enjoy sappiness, you will enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and so does my family. Everyone plays it all the time! I love the world tour especially the flamingo hunt! LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I love Sylvia Day and the Crossfire Series as well as many of her other works. This was never identified as a trilogy but instead a series. Entwined With You was a great book with twists, turns and various new plots. The story kept me going and intrigued in where Gideon and Eva are headed. The characters in this series will make you love them one minute, hate them the next and shed a tear for them the very next... you'll find this all in Entwined With You. While I won't spoil anything in the book, I will say that I was very displeased by the sudden way that this book ended. In fact, I flipped the page and said out loud \\"What? Was that the end or did I miss something?\\" and then I went back and re-read the last 5 pages just to make sure that it really was the end of the book. I highly recommend this series and I look forward to the fourth and fifth installments in the series!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I have been waiting for this app ever since it came out on the I pod unfortunately I only have the first gen. I pod so it couldn't get the app. I got it just as the fad ended but its still very fun
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Read all the books and could not wait for the movie.  A good reprsentation of the book,  Looking forward to the next installment.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app has saved me from getting to school hours late! I recommend the bells, that really helps me get up! It is very convenient and doesn't waste battery! I love it!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|AR has been around forever, if you don't know what it is, you are completely new to PDF files. Works well, this is just the Android App version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked the book because it finished the series and gave me the answers to all of my unanswered questions.
1623420148|5.0|Well this book literally made me laugh out loud a million times. Drew, I love you! Not just because your sexy as hell but because you say it like it is!! I only found Drew is be a jackass one time in this book and it wasn’t because he was a womanizer for most of it. Drew did one thing, he was being a copout.<br /><br />I love love love that Drew hates Disney as much as I do!!<br /><br />“For God's sake, don't let her watch Cinderella. What kind of example is that? A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a frigging break!”<br /><br />Drew and Kate are cut from the same cloth. I loved their relationship because they were both very blunt with each other which made the book hilarious!<br />I strongly suggest you read this book!!! But only if you are looking for a feel-good make you laugh out loud kind of book.<br /><br />There is a sequel coming out this year called 'Twisted' but I think it will have a new couple, which is sad because I love Drew and Kate but exciting because Emma Chase is one of my new favorite authors!
0307352145|5.0|Very well researched. Cain did a brilliant job with this book. As someone who has been told to &#34;speak up&#34; countless times in life, I identified strongly with many of Cain's points and observations. I can honestly say that this book has had a positive influence in my life. You will be surprised at what you learn!
B005EY2XFC|5.0|First of all, shipping was quick and efficient.<br />Now the movie itself is my personal favorite.  The genre is action but the feel is almost more of a romance.  Solid performance by Brandon Lee.  If you enjoy an emotional attachment to characters you won't be disappointed here.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read this before I watched the movie. Leaving to get the movie right now!! It was a great book! Reminds you that happiness is essential!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Standard Kindle program, usable with Kindles or Android based OSs to read Ebooks. Works as always, quite well. Read free books. Become literate. Go you.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was 20% in, and I didn't even finish it. When it first starts I felt it doesn't continue from where book 2 ended. I was so disappointed, after months of waiting. BOO!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great classic game to play. Helps calm you after a busy day! Very relaxing not crazy music behind the game to hear.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page and kept me turning l pages until the very end. Kathy Reich's' experience as a forensic anthropologist is visible in every aspect of the story, and makes the book highly entertaining.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|This is a Beta version and needed on a Kindle Fire HD in order to use Flash Player still required by some web sites. It works very well, but hangs on occasion. But being a Beta version, that is to be expected. Overall an easy to use browser.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|While the central mystery (mysteries) were intriguing it was not clear to me why Brennan took the journey to NWT; her presence seemed superfluous.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I have been using File Manager programs starting with Dos 3, so I have some experience. While anyone in the know realizes you cannot just wander through all the intimate files on an Android device or memory card per default, this takes file management to a whole new level. Not only can you access you SD card and move files around at will, but you can open and customize pretty much anything you want, including creating links to folders on your main screen that automatically take you into the ESfe so you can open files using standard programs without having to wander through the directory trees. ie. Ebooks in a folder on your SD card.<br />And trust me, thats just the beginning. Kudos ESfe.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|It's been a crazy ride with this show but it's still holding my attention. Looks great in Blu Ray! Peace.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />Nice, quality braided USB cable.<br />Smooth Glide pads on the bottom for fast movement.<br />Changeable light colors.<br />Switchable DPI.<br />Good button layout, availability.<br />Reprogrammable buttons.<br />Looks sharp.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Hard to dig the weights out of the packaging.<br />Side buttons just out a bit and take some getting used to.<br />I sometimes accidentally trigger the DPI adjustment button.<br /><br />Overall, a great bargain, and not enough &#34;Cons&#34; to justify the loss of a star. Would buy again.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was the first game like this I've tried and I'm a fan forever now! I can't wait to start part two. I do have to say Thanks for the hint button! I never could have finished without it! This was truly a fun and challenging game! I
B00C7NKPPS|1.0|I can't believe that Paul McCartney would allow something with such inferior audio quality to be marketed in 2013.  Little or no effort was made to digitally optimize the live recordings assembled here.  In fact, I consider the performances themselves to be substandard, not worthy of the hype of this release.<br /><br />I would try to sell this in the secondary market, but I don't want to be responsible for unloading it on someone else.  Due to my complete dissatisfaction with this purchase, this will be the last time I buy any Paul McCartney release.  I work too hard for my money to help subsidize a billionaire's lifestyle, or further enrich a global marketing enterprise like Amazon that sells a poor-quality product based on overly-inflated pre-release hype.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a awesome and fun game to play and its challenging to I give it 5stars starts by Angelo awesome!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love the DVD series.  I am waiting on this season's DVD release and the next book in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a super fun game that you get super addicted to. I love this game it is AWESOME!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|good movie, hope they make a sequel. was a bit slow at parts but the story line was good. Wish Emmy Rossum was in it more too, her character fascinated me :)
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I began reading this book because of all of the good things people had to say about it.  It seemed like it took forever to read!!!  Not because it was a bad book, but I just had a hard time staying interested in it.  It read like a bunch of short stories, some were more interesting than others.  So not a bad book, but I was hoping for better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very sad but awesome ending. I didn't think that there were really any unanswered questions so I think the author tied up all the loose ends. It didn't leave me wondering about anything. Great ending to the series.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I was having horrible pains in my hand and arm from computer use. This mouse is not only very comfortable and natural feeling, but the pain has dramtically reduced after using this mouse for almost a year. I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who is thinking about trying it.
B009T1J0HA|5.0|I bought this book and was very happy with my buy. It is for age 8 to infinity. It is a great book. It is almost as good as Roald Dahl books. It is abook that everyone should buy.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I loved this game on my smart phone so downloaded it to my kindle hd. There were so many ads I couldn't play the game.  I deleted the app.
034580404X|5.0|I chose this read for my daughter having read it myself. I passed it along to a friend and she to another!!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I often tell people that Queens of the Stone Age are the best new band to emerge in the 2000s (even though they started slightly before that). Not only that, they are consistently one of the best live shows you are ever gonna see. I know a lot of people refer to Songs for the Deaf as the defining QOTSA album, but for me that would be Lullabies to Paralyze, because it shows the flexibility and versatility of the band and Josh Homme's songwriting and guitarwork. Like Clockwork does this but even better, it is more centered, but still maintains that versatility. I've listened to the CD twice (once on a preview) and once this morning and it is so solid through and through. You have those albums you wait years for and they either are lackluster or just fall completely flat. Like Clockwork is the exact opposite. It grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, even during the soulful piano ballads of \\"Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" and the closing title track. For me the standouts initially are \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\", because it so quintessential Queens, \\"Kalopsia\\" treads the line between piano driven verse and gut-wrenching guitar driven chorus\\" and \\"I Appear Missing\\" is one of the best songs Josh Homme has ever written, it's just devastatingly good. All of the other tracks, either fit right into everything you love about Queens of the Stone Age or explore new territories they dominate from the jump. This is definitely one of the best albums of the year and will remain so when it comes to an end.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Spoiler alert....this is not the end.  She leaves us hanging..<br />This was supposed to be the last of a trilogy....but of course it's not.<br />What is it with these authors?  Clearly it's becoming about the money and at $9.99 it must be good money.<br />Yes the story is hot and sexy...but we get way more questions than answers.<br />Very frustrating....not sure I'm going to be buying anymore ;(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this games is not the bomb but it does kill time when needed I'll always use this game because it can be fun at times
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|gideon is my favorite.  i obsessed over this Â«trilogyÂ». i re read book two yesterday. i was all set for book three today. i jumped on amazon read the reiviews and guess what? im returning my gideon. this is such bs!!! a trilogy means three. not five. it was a s****y thing to do to the loyal and patient readers of this series. im done. gideon, i will miss you but theres no shortage of gazillionaire hotties in smut literature these days.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A good book that is terribly sad at times and laugh out loud funny at others.  It really took me away.  This one will stay with me for a while.
B0067R0APK|1.0|A couple of updates ago the radar quit working. I had this on my phone and kindle fire and no radar on either one. I uninstalled it and went with another product. I hope they fix it because I paid for an app that does not work.....
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good thriller.It moved through the plot well but I was disappointed in the ending. It ended so abruptly that I actually thought it was an error and there were pages missing.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Today's world, not as we might wish it, but as it is. Great and believable characters. Moves like a rocket.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome. I play it everyday. I have just one complaint it takes way to long to get coins. Otherwise good
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|was a touch below the other die hard movies.. obscure violence just put there cause that is theme of all of these movies.  had to watch cause i do love bruce willis and the other movies in the set.. lol glad i did see it but will not buy the dvd in the long run..
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Sylvia Bernstein writes in an easy to follow and understand method that takes you through all the details of aquaponics gardening. This is a must read for anyone serious about aquaponics, I love it and am now reading it for the third time as I set up my system.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink did it again, as always she makes another great album!!!!  Great songs and the item was perfect when received!!  Thank you!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The ending was not what I expected, but I found myself switching who I thought was the hero many times. Definitely worth the read.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|great product I ordered two more! The kids love it.  It also has sound.  Gizmo Hum. I would recommend to any Gremlins fan
1449417051|5.0|The Oatmeal will keep you laughing every month of the year. Most of the comics you can find online, but still funny.

B00004RYZT|5.0|If you are a fan of Rammstein you need this in your collection. Tell a friend and get them hooked.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|if you liked either/both the previous quell games this will not disappoint. this one still has four games per level with each level having it's own theme (turing on lights,  breaking ice, etc. this one also contains a couple of new twists on the game. each puzzle has hidden jewels to find (by breaking solid squares) and at least one game per level has a hidden game inside (look for a bronze ring in the same place you see the &quot;game complete&quot; and &quot;found jewel&quot; icon on each levels main screen). it is physically impossible to find the hidden objects and get a perfect score which makes it even more fun playing each game  at least twice to accomplish both goals. and btw the hidden games have hidden objects (clocks) to find as well.<br /><br />so far I am on level 5 and have found all hidden objects/games and have perfect scores except for two. one I can't seems to find any place for the bronze ring and another where I find no way to get the perfect score (only one off). on the other hand somehow I managed to get a better than perfect score (13/14) on a hidden game but can't exactly figure how I did that one since on replays I am finding it hard enough to get that perfect score (even though my score was better than perfect it did not count as a perfect score for the game stats hence the replay on that one. in all this is a game I highly recommend. I know my 9 yr old niece will be excited to see I have another of one of her favorite games.
0553386794|4.0|I don't poke my nose into fantasy literature very often but, when I do, it's generally a positive experience.  J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books are enchanting, and T. H. White's \\"The Once and Future King\\" gobsmacked me with its brilliant take on the legend of King Arthur.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" isn't quite in the same league as Potter and \\"King,\\" but I admire Martin's ambition.  Creating a huge cast of characters and detailed description (too detailed at times; must we learn the name, lineage, and attire of every knight, peasant, and maiden in the story?), Martin unveils \\"Westeros,\\" a mythical land bearing a strong resemblance to medieval England, and one in which warring clans battle for control of its Seven Kingdoms.  It's a (mostly) believable world, but it never really captivated me the way the Potter series did, and it lacks the charm of \\"The Once and Future King.\\"  It is not, however, short on graphic sex and violence.<br /><br />\\"Thrones\\" is a long book, the first in a planned series of seven volumes.  This might be one of those rare instances where you are better off watching the TV version on HBO, rather than investing weeks, or months, of your life on this massive written opus.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. But I wish you could choose the color, gender, and breed of your first horse. It's still fun though
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A great heart wrenching book that will leave you on the edge of your seat, and its bound to give you chills. I loved the book. It was deeply religion based, and I found myself clenching my shirt in anticipation during the story. However I rated it 4 stars because the story starts out kind of slow, and the middle of the story is kind of confusing, and has many segments or Gore, not the best book for younger kids, but a great one for kids, maybe 10 and up.<br /><br />A Pikmin Review.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is really good it keeps you entertain and is just pure on fun thank you backflip studios for this game
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Loved this movie, pretty good action flick and a nice throwback.  Ryan Gosling is fantastic without saying much (as usual).

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The game was fun and addictive, however very anticlimactic! I know that more games are to come but....! Look forward to more of The Room!!
B00BMBA2CC|5.0|Saw her live in Boston on May 25th , 2013 and I can see why Coldplay had her on tour with them.  As she is pure fresh new talent and has excellent lyrical talent and ability to write.  If you are looking for fresh talent and a good CD to listen to I strongly suggest Charli's debut CD \\"True Romance\\"<br /><br />Buy It and try it...........doubt you will regret the purchase
0062238868|5.0|Well written book.  Describes what war is really like.  If you enjoy reading books based on a true story and war books, you will like this one.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|I bought this for my 9 year old my son who loves Minecraft right now. He has lots of Lego sets big and small.  This is the priciest set I've ever purchased in proportion to size.  I felt I had to buy him more presents because giving this tiny set didn't feel like a full gift for my only kid.<br /><br />He is having fun with it although when he is done assembling it I will fit it in palm of my hand.<br /><br />Buy this for the hardcore Minecraft fans.  Don't buy it for the hardcore Lego fans.  My son is both for now.
B005SGMS0G|1.0|despite having clicked OK to allowing Amazon to reduce the quality of my hi def purchase,(which is already pretty lame)...the video still stopped and buffered several times anyway.  Video was poor quality standard definition for the price of a hi def viewing. Not at all happy.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The beginning was plodding and not in Archers typical great style. Sir Giles personality traits kept shifting and his behavior with Virginia never felt real.  It was only later that the book turned into something resembling the Archer novels I have enjoyed for so long .  The story remained only so so until Sebastian was ready to graduate and then it started reading like a true Archer novel.  Maybe the next one will be more consistent
B004EJUMT2|5.0|This is rock, this is metal, this is pure Satanic rock...........Hail Satan............Hail Metal..........Hail Papa ;)<br />Saw them live on May 10th, 2013 in Boston and Hell I have to say was one of the best shows I've been to in ages!<br /><br />Buy the record!
0425263924|1.0|Looking for the hea disappointed it didn't happen.  Don't think I will buying the next one to many other great authors out there.  I heard this SERIES is being made into a tv series and I believe that is why she added all these new story lines.  In my opinion she should have concluded Gideon and Eva's story and then worked on the tv series.  We waited to long for this hea.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best minecraft game invented it is true mojang games are the best.minecraft to me looks boaring  but really PERFECT
B008EKMB82|3.0|My head still isn't wrapped around this whole thing. I feel like I need to reread it. Very well written going back and forth between two stories.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the Gideon fix in Entwined With You and Yes, I wish we didn't have to wait so long for book 4, but it speaks volumes as to how much we all have connected with Gideon and Eva!  This book was fantastic.  I loved all the time Gideon and Eva spent together and the growth of their relationship.  They are learning love and trust and are moving beyond their pasts.<br /><br />They show us all that love, true love, allows us the opportunity to fashion it to our own needs as a couple and it does not have to fit a certain preordained mold.  Thank you Sylvia Day for that!  We are all individuals and our relationships and lives are individual!<br /><br />I actually like the adding of characters and their storylines.  We do not live in a vacuum.  We all have friends and family who play a part in our lives and decisions.  Looking forward to reading more in the next two books, or however many more are written with Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />I do not think the negative review are fair.  Reviews are to speak to the book not to issues with the number of books in the series, etc.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Maps do no work in the plus version on the Nexus 4.  I can download the free version from the Play store and the maps work fine.  This has been a problem for over 6 months now and they have yet to fix the problem.  I guess it is a case of take your money and run on the paid version....

B008BQ8VOC|2.0|I was not impressed with the profanity and sex.  I like the idea of the show but it needs to be cleaned up.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I installed this on my Kindle. Gotta say I really like it. The free version only lets you save so many cameras. With the full version I can have all my cameras and the sound support is great.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I love her musical styling, voice, and lyrics.  The way she sings a ballad, any ballad, always moves me.  Of the modern female vocalists, she is one of my favorites.

B00BXKOMT6|5.0|From the first page I knew I was in for a great read, this is the kind of story I enjoy ,becoming familiar with the main characters and wanting more from every turn of the page.<br />Anthony Ryan delivered just what I require in a book it's brutal savagery explained in such graphic detail so there is no mistaking what has just taken place on the battle field ,in a snow storm or the training field,awesome read........
B000SEFNMS|4.0|Although there are writers who could have told this story with perhaps a little more literary illustration or even poetry, I feel there was no better candidate than Jon Krakauer. Chris McCandless' tale needed an author who was diligent in his research and discovery, and adventurous enough to bring himself as close to the young man's journey as possible. This allowed him to uncover truth and some understanding of McCandless and why these events took place.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The story was totally engrossing and fascinating.  It was not your run-of-the-mill storyline, but the cinematography alone was worth the purchase.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so looking forward to this book coming out, I pre-ordered.  Boy was I disappointed.  I keep looking at how far into the book I was and thinking there are a lot of loose ends to wrap up before it ends .... and why is she introducing all this stuff now?  I was very disappointed in the fluff and thin story line.  When I found out she is stretching this out to not 4 BUT 5 books, I decided I'm DONE.  I, like so many other readers, thought Trilogy meant three.  I don't like being sold a false bill of goods.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Would like it so much more if I didn't feel like I have to have others to get going where I wish I could go without  help.
0425263924|1.0|I was a big fan of books 1 & 2 but after reading all the terrible reviews I have Decided Not to buy this book.<br />Instead I have desided to purches Release Me & Claim Me because trilogy means 3 and when you spend your hard earned money on a book & wait patiently for a long time for the big finally just to find out that its not the end I feel just like everyone else CHEATED & DISAPPOINTED!!<br />This is not how you should treat your fans Miss Day.<br />I'am now an ex fan and will not buy anymore of her books in the future.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game keeps stopping and pausing. Sometimes it pushes every five seconds and sometimes it just stops. A few times I would do something and the game acted like I didn't do anything.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Loved it before Miami update...did update and it deleted all my content I contacted the company and then they claim they can't restore but they can and just don't want to take blame for their update not being Amazon compatible yet....and if that was the case why even give the option to update..... #Waste of Time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author lets you feel as if you are there.<br />How the characters feel, how they experience and express life.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Although it started off slow at first, the book definitely got good toward the end of part two. A really good read.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Ahhhhhhhhhh this app is crazy freaking amazing I love it and I hope that buy submitting this ill get a bonus
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book a number of years ago and this was my first reread. It always has, and always will have, a very special place in my heart.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|First, to start out, Sylvia Day is an excellent writer.  However, the idea of paying 9.99 for a book that is going to go on and on is ridiculous.<br />Now to Entwined with You.  I thought my eyes were deceiving me about Ava.  Without giving away any spoilers, Ava does not know what she wants and I think Gideon should just walk away from her.  If she is too naive to realize how much he loves her, well, he needs to walk away and maybe the nightmares will end.  I see the same story in each chapter and I feel the entire story could have been finished in this book.<br />I am not sure if I am done with Crossfire series, but I can assure I will not be preordering the books in the future.  I will wait a few months before I buy and read them.
B00003003R|2.0|I had really high expectations for this CD.  I should have read some backround information on it before I purchased it.  Seems David Geffin who owed their record label put this together without ANY input from the band because G&R owed him another album that they didn't deliver.  He certainly didn't pick the best of their live performances.  If you don't alreadly own this I wouldn't waste my money on it.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It is a Minecraft like game. In my opinion momentary is better, but since this is free it is good enough. Also if you want this game you might as well buy the full because this only gives you about 10 minutes of game time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best game on the. Internet. It's entertaining,and frustrating at times but is a great challenge. It has all the things needed for great passing of time.
B009KEN87O|4.0|So simple, yet I have a hard time putting it down. I think they nailed the graphics to give it a great retro feel.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|This album seems to be another attempt from Dave to get on the radio.  It's not a horrible record by any means, but the depth is quite lacking.  I was a big fan of Cryptic Writings, but Risk had me scratching my head....as does Super Collider.  If you loved Risk, you'll probably love this record.  I certainly don't hate it, but I do expect more from them than thrash coated pop metal.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This is such an addictive app. My daughter and I have competitions to see who can create the best model. The app is easy enough for my almost four year old to navigate and she really enjoys it too. My concerns include the ads that continue to pop up even though I purchased the full upgrade and the occasional force closes in the middle of makeup application.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like the majority of people here, I Pre ordered, waited patiently woke up this am and right THERE on my Kindle is the ending for Gideon and Eva only to read reviews to find out it isn't.  Didn't even peek into it...I am seriously done with this formatting of books.  I have some still preordered...this man confessed, and If I were you sequels but I am no longer buying a book one at a time waiting months and months for these books to come out.  I feel like Sally Field holding up the sign in Norma Rae saying Union but what if Amazon gets flooded with returns of this book?  Would that send a message?  So far we have spent $29.97 and there's no end in sight.  So we will have to she'll out another $9.99 and HOPE that's the last book?  Funnily enough, after reading reviews I didn't have any second thoughts about returning this book.  I clicked purchased by mistake as it was a mistake...I thought I was buying the third book in a trilogy.  My inner Norma Rae rejoices
B002BGA7WM|5.0|I've been a big fan of Muse for several years, and I'm not sure why I never bothered to pick up their first album, considering I love all of the other ones.<br /><br />It delighted me to see the evolution of their music! Though the album is very much Muse, it's got a certain rawness and wildness that contrasts with the near ridiculous levels of polish and bombast in their newest entry 2nd Law.<br /><br />Put simply: I like it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great after the update finally came! I love that they have new designs for characters and that it has more colour
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Plain and simple and no regrets. Honest and humble. God bless Chris and thank God mobile him were on our side.
B006XOBFJC|3.0|Sony's 14-disc re-release of Marek Janowski's \\"Ring of the Nibelungen\\" is pretty good throughout but no better.  The cycle was recorded in the early 1980s in East Germany and features a number of important and talented vocalists.  Clocking in at just over 14 hours, I'll make some comments on summary areas, starting with the good.<br /><br />Theo Adam and Rene Kollo::  Theo sings the role of Wotan and Kollo does Siegfried.  They are excellent throughout in what is a taxing and consistently difficult pair of parts.  Kollo has a big range and sings the higher passages with accuracy and a lack of audible effort.  Adam, a baritone who made this recording in the twilight of his career, was well-known for his Wagner interpretations and I think makes the best individual effort on this entire set, an important plus given how central the roles of Wotan and his disguised twin The Wanderer are to the Ring cycle.<br /><br />Marek Janowski: The Ring is a cycle often dominated by the orchestra and so the role of the conductor is key to any performance.  How does Janowski do?  I'd say \\"ok\\" but no better.  The Staatskapelle Dresden plays accurately throughout but Janowski misses many opportunities for beauty.  To take one example, the exciting opening of \\"Siegfried\\" Act III, leading up to a dialogue between The Wanderer and Erda, the spirit of the earth, is played without the intensity we know it can possess.  Likewise, two of the most beautiful orchestral depictions in the Ring, the opening Prelude of \\"Das Rheingold\\" and Siegfried's Funeral Music in the last act of \\"Gotterdammerung\\", are simply not as beautiful and striking as I've heard elsewhere.  I attribute this not to incompetence - the orchestra plays in a technically assured way throughout - but to a simple lack of inspiration and intensity on Janowski's part.  To be fair, I do want to point to one section where the orchestra contributes particularly effectively: the gloomy forest scene initiating Act II of \\"Siegfried\\" is done perfectly, somber and spooky.<br /><br />The sound: This is a problem.  The cycle is an early digital effort done using a slightly different type of recording technology.  I found the midrange to be very good but the bass is boomy and the treble, particularly problematic, is full of hash and lacks clarity.  I don't know whether to attribute this to the original technology or the re-mastering, but whatever the source of the problems, a Ring cycle disadvantaging Wagner's spectacular orchestration - he is for me one of the best orchestrators in history - and making harsh the already difficult higher vocal passages - well... it's a problem.<br /><br />I need to at least mention the performance of Jeannine Altmeyer, in the lead female role of Brunnhilde.  Altmeyer, in the early part of her career, is pretty good, very musical in the passages where she feels comfortable but a bit out of control in the extremely hard ones.<br /><br />This is somewhat harsh commentary on a cycle that won a Grammy when first released.  The three stars reflect the major issues with any Ring cycle featuring a middling orchestral performance and mediocre sound engineering.  Before writing this review, I asked myself whether in the future I'd listen to it when I wanted to hear the Ring, rather than my reference Georg Solti cycle and the answer was a flat - with the exception of that powerful Act II from Siegfried - \\"no way.\\"ne perfectly, somber and spooky.<br /><br />The sound: This is a problem.

B00BB22GQM|4.0|\\"Modern Vampires of The City\\" is what happens when creatures that can never die begin to contemplate the future. Vampire Weekend's third album is a mostly muted affair, whispering maturity from the first gospele-ish harmonies and finger poked piano of \\"Obvious Bicycle.\\" Lead singer Ezra Koenig has put aside most of his quirkiness to concentrate on meaningful lyrical statements. \\"Girl, you and I will die nonbelievers...is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?\\" Granted, he's singing to a girl who is an outsider along with him, but instead of making it a joke (ala \\"Cousins\\" on \\"Contra\\"), he's more concerned about mortality.<br /><br />This newfound sense of seriousness will probably put off some of the indie-heads who can't stomach when their favorite band \\"sells out\\" (\\"Modern Vampires\\" debuted at number one on Billboard) or takes a significant step away from their early sound. While there are a few things I miss, like some louder guitar for one, I don't miss the preciousness of the first album. This is a band that no longer squeals \\"college band\\" at every turn of phrase or overtly and obvious attention grabbing musical stunt. The Vampire Weekend of the debut would probably not be telling you \\"There's a headstone right in front of you\\" (\\"Don't Lie\\"), for example.<br /><br />There are still a few plays for the radio. \\"Diane Young\\" clips along at a kinetic pace and even throws in some auto-tune to mock anyone who wants to call \\"Modern Vampires\\" 'serious music,' all the while playing pun games with \\"Diane Young\\" and 'dying young.' It also contains one of the weirder lyrical choices I've heard on a record this year, Koenig tells Diane she's got \\"the luck of a Kennedy.\\" Yes, they want to be taken seriously with \\"Modern Vampires Of The City\\" taking on life, death, religion and the big bad specter of growing up, but Vampire Weekend has that cake and their quirky, too.

030758836X|1.0|I started reading this book and was instantly engrossed.  It caught my attention and I could not put it down.  Then as I got closer and closer to the end, the book got worse and worse. By the time I finished it I was so mad that I wasted my time and I wished I hadn't read it.  It switches at some point close to the end to become the most ludicrous and unbelievable story ever!!!
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Old Guys Rule!  I enjoyed Eric's songs of the sixties and seventies. He was &#34;edgy&#34; then and he is now.It is very reflective of his life in the twillight of his years. Well done! Very very powerful. I think he is a good now and he was then.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I really enjoyed this addition to the psy-changeling series.  I stayed up all night reading it because it was so good!  So many different pieces are tied together in this book and a lot of secrets are revealed.  This book more so than the last few really focused on the main couple which I personally prefer.  There was also a lot of action.  I highly recommend this book and I'm off to re-read it!!

An unsettling structure to what could have been a good story produces an unsatisfying finish to what could have been a good movie. Not the best performances by these top stars. Wasted talent and poorly used resources.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|As I have read all of the Psy/Changling novels, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this latest one ... Like, no joke I opened my Kindle and started reading at midnight immediately when it came out, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />So... Excuse me while I fan girl out because, oh my god. I loved it. Honestly... I never thought I could like a hero from a book so much. I totally wasn't expecting to LOVE Kaleb like that. But, I mean, really? How could you not? The sheer depth of love that he felt for Sahara was awesome. It has to be exhilarating to know that you are the ONLY person someone that powerful cares for.<br /><br />Anyway, beyond my squeals of excitement over this book (have I mentioned that I love it?).... This is Singh at her best. As always, she builds a world that you just want to immerse yourself in because you're that invested in the characters. However, I was kind of sad to not see much interaction with the changling packs ... Even though I know that wasn't the main purpose of this book, I still mourn not seeing much of them.<br /><br />Beyond that, Singh answers many questions that I have been chomping at the bit to have answered (Regarding Pure Psy and the like).<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy this book. It was awesome. :)

B009EHDU7U|4.0|A really enjoyable book with a very different take. I loved the references to history and the crazy characters Allan met along the way.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it's better than average. I just wish there were more free pictures to choose from. I'm not paying for something that's average.

B007XNAOS0|1.0|why is there so much praise for an album that is an even bigger step backwards than their previous attempt? it seems like this album is trying way to hard to be accepted by a main stream audience. the best thing about this terrible record: it created a new found respect for the red album. that's it.
B00005T30L|4.0|I'm in my mid 40s and never even heard of this movie before, but learned of it by chance when it was mentioned as someone's favorite movie in a blog.  It sounded interesting to me, since the main character reminded me of one of my daughters.  I decided to take a chance on it, and am glad I did.  Anyone that knows someone that doesn't fit in mainstream society or that doesn't care what people think of them for just being themselves, will appreciate this movie.  I really enjoyed it, even though the ending left you wondering what happens next.  I guess you'll just have to watch it for yourself to see what I mean.  ;)
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Megadeth is back with a new album \\"Super Collider\\"! Expectations were sky high for this one, and still it meets them easily. From the opening track \\"Kingmaker\\" to the last track, the album delivers a great variety of new heavy metal classics. Dave Mustaine`s songwriting & unique vocals, combined with some of the greatest guitar playing in heavy metal fit together seamlessly.<br />A different sound & certainly not as brutal as \\"Rust in Peace\\", or any other of the band`s first 4 albums, but still 100% Megadeth! If brutality and speed is not all you want in your metal, \\"Super Collider\\" totally ROCKS!<br />My favourite songs on the album: \\"Kingmaker\\", \\"Dance in the Rain\\" and \\"Forget to Remember\\".<br />5/5 stars. Easily.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I don't know how to begin this comment, but I would first like to commend the author for creating a very popular book and I respect her for completing and publishing a book, which many writers never do.<br /><br />However, I did not care for this book one bit. I did finish it, so my comment immediately holds value, thank you very much.<br /><br />The characters were developed, close to the side of &#34;well developed&#34; but not quite. Travis pissed me off and irritated me so much. He seriously lacked deductive reasoning skills, problem solving skills, and a level head. But, alas, he did have fighting skills, which is probably the reason for all of the five star posts, sexual fantasies, and eyes filled with desire. I, however, don't give a damn about fighting skills or sexy, hot bodies. I would prefer to read a story about a very independent male and a very independent female who come together to be independent together.<br /><br />Travis seemed to always do the wrong thing, and he was never able to make a good decision. To be in college, he lacked common sense that should have been gained during high school, like falling for scams, or getting caught up in the mob, or playing stupid love games that suck, or even buying a damn puppy. It's as if every action he made was made by a five year old. Why would he buy a puppy to keep at his place for an on-again-off-again girlfriend who is also in college and shouldn't have time to care for a puppy? Ugh!<br /><br />In sum, this book lacked maturity. It lacked problem solving. It overfloweth with frustration. The end.
B004M54NWU|5.0|I was very much in love with both characters and the truth they both portray in this love story. The plot was hilarious from beginning to end and had all the great parts you would expect and not-expect at the same time...good good time had. I highly recommend.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|When I read the sample, I wasn't sure if I would like it.  Was I wrong!  I cannot wait for the next one.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Hmmmm,shockingly average.<br />Do you want to listen to a Jerry Cantrell solo album as done by REM?<br />If you do then you'll enjoy this more than I did.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is a great tool for use with Solidworks. I had one for over 5 years (and kind of beat the crap out of it) and when it burned out I instantly ordered another one. This is an essential tool for productivity.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Ordered this watch late Friday and received it on Tuesday and was exactly what I was looking for it is nice and heavy and looks great..  Just looking to see how I can take a link out cause its a little too long other then that I would definitely recommend
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Good app. Great graphics. Something that will hold attention and act as a catalyst to spend time with little ones. Cannot wait to play with the little people in my life.
B00007E7K0|4.0|The actual snap on cap is the non-stock cap with the large pinch areas, not the stock cap indicated in the product images. Works fine and is actually easier to grab but may not suit desired aesthetics necessarily.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited months for this book to release and spent the whole day reading it. Cant believe she ended the book<br />With more questions than answers.  At this point there's so much going on that I cant keep up. Why does she have Eva going after another man and leaving her husband to go see him? Loved the story at first but will not be getting the next book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My second favorite musical of all time.  Doesn't have the impact of the show, and does drag at times, but the music is glorious and the acting very good.  I'll watch this one many times over the years.
1405910275|4.0|Oh how I love me some Gideon.. ♥ Thank god for him. After all the nonsense we've all been through to get to this point of having the book in our hands, I'm pleased to say he made it worth it.<br /><br />Before starting Entwined with You I had spent 3 days re-reading the first two in the series. My heart breaks for Gideon every time I read Reflected in You, the awful things he has been through and is still going through is so sad to witness. By the end, we know what Gideon has done to protect Eva, so going in to book #3 I was scared for him. How was he going to deal with the demons that already plague his daily life as well as gives him nightmares? Add to that, what he has done to protect Eva, I wasn't sure how he would cope.<br /><br />  \\"I can survive anything if I have you.\\"<br /><br />There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that that quote is extremely appropriate for Gideon and Eva. In the short amount of time they have known each other, and bizarrely enough it really is a very short amount of time, they have already been through a life time of ups and downs. But throughout it all their love has never wavered and that's one of the many things I adore about them as a couple.<br /><br />  \\"You're what drives me, Eva. Can you understand that? You're my heart and soul. If something ever happened to you, it would kill me, too.\\"<br /><br />So much goes on in this book and yet at the same time, not a lot at all. Some questions from the first two books are answered but I am also left with a million and one unanswered questions yet again. (view spoiler) I appreciate the fact that there are 2 more books, at least, in the series but I am now back to dreading the wait for them.<br /><br />Once again the steam factor in this book was off the charts. We all know that the physical side of Gideon and Eva's relationship is explosive and that certainly hadn't changed in book #3. I was never bored of the sex scenes, each one was different. They range from being nothing but hot, mind-blowing sex, to the most emotional love making I have ever read.<br /><br />  \\"Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to eff a woman right out of her mind.\\"<br /><br />Overall the book was definitely worth the horrendous book hangover that I am feeling right now but I do have a complaint... or two.<br />I've already gone over the nonsense of having to wait so long for the book and having parts of spoiled thanks to careless readers receiving the book early. I'm over that now but I definitely don't have a lot of faith in this publisher.<br />Secondly, the ending. So disappointing. When I made it to the end I felt like it just fell completely flat. I was trying to turn the page and get to more but there wasn't anymore. The ending was so quick and abrupt that I was sure I was missing some pages. It was just very bizarre. I would definitely say, without hesitation, that this does NOT a cliffhanger. Eva and Gideon are together and doing better than they have in a long time. If anything, we are just left wanting more answers. Surely this can be expected when a series has 2 more books to go? I can't for the life of me understand what people are complaining about.<br /><br />Now on to the months and months of waiting for book #4...<br /><br />  \\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"mind-blowing sex, to the most emotional love making I have ever read.<br /><br />  \\"Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to eff a woman right out of her mind.\\"<br /><br />Overall the book was definitely worth the horrendous book hangover that I am feeling right now but I do have a complaint... or two.<br />I've already gone over the nonsense of having to wait so long for the book and having parts of spoiled thanks to careless readers receiving the book early.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I was sad I couldn't play Minecraft on the computer. ( computer was too slow and old) but then I got minecraft pocket edition and now I can play minecraft on the go like when my family goes on long road trips. Buy this game. IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT. Oh and check out Ihascupquake, slyfoxhound,goodtimeswithscar, and rachelkip on YouTube. They play minecraft.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Job well done again...Holy hell was that a great book.Received so many answers from the last 2 books.Watched them fall in love even more with each other.Yes the story goes on,,,and I for one cant wait to read more.Gideon got even more sexier in this book.Loved every word of every page.
B008220D5K|5.0|I don't know why this doesn't have better rating because this was soo funny. This couple are a riot! Love this movie they are funnier in this than in knocked up.
B001JV5B12|3.0|I am building a set as a gift, I love the underworld movies and at the price, this was a great buy.im sure my husband will enjoy it.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Musicals are rarely big hits in movies, but I believe this is an exception, in large part because of the choice of actors who carry their roles and musical demands well.  The other reason why I like this movie is because the music can't be beat.  There are so many memorable songs that really create the setting needed to appreciate Les Miserables in any form.
