B009YU62H2|4.0|An earlier reviewer said this was closer to Superunknown than Badmotorfinger.  It's somewhere in between.  And it rocks pretty hard.  Highpoints are \\"My Crooked Steps\\" and \\"Bones of Birds\\" but the whole thing is very solid.  Dark and brooding, riff-rocky, spacey, gloomy, this album takes me back to the late 90's and may surpass any of their earlier albums as a total package.

1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan is AMAZING! His writing style really draws you in from the very beginning. Something about it just takes hold of your mind and thoughts and sucks you into the pages. This book was no exception. It was action packed and was a definite page turner. As long as this book is, 608 pages, I flew threw it. I could not put it down! I definitely recommend all his book :) For those of you who love this series, this is a MUST READ!<br /><br />So much happened in this book that blew my mind. So many different factors were taking play and the demigods where on their journey to stop Gaea from waking. In this installment, all seven demigods who are part of the prophecy are finally united and are setting out on their quest to stop Gaea. It was so interesting to see some of our favorite characters working together in the same setting. The pov's of this book switch between Annabeth, Percy, Leo, and Piper. It was so interesting to see into the minds of all four characters. Leo was interesting :) The boy has adhd to the extreme.<br /><br />What I loved most about The Mark of Athena was the action. Once things got going on their journey, it was pages after page of non stop action. So many different things happened and one event always led to another, it takes you mind on a journey as if you were there with the characters. I also liked how you see the love connections still. You would think with so much going on the romance would be non existent, but you do get some romance, but just not a lot.<br /><br />If you love mythology, Rick Riordan's books are definitely for you. Even if you don't care to much for mythology and just want an adventurous, action packed book to read, then give his books a try. I HIGHLY recommend them. If you love this series, this is a MUST READ. I repeat, a MUST READ :) I can't wait for the House of Hades because that ending......
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I am teaching this book in my 5th grade Humanities class. It touches on many issues salient to the 5th grade experience, ie: fitting in, being or feeling 'the other', bullying and how we treat each other. Auggie, a 10 year old boy with facial deformities due to a genetic anomaly is entering a middle school (at an exclusive private school) for the first time. His reaction to his peers and theirs to him brings to light much food for thought and issues to explore. It is written from the perspective of several characters, a technique that is not realized with complete success, and the ending is a bit unrealistic and saccharine, but overall, it poses some big and important questions in an eminently readable and accessible format for it's intended audience: other 5th graders.
B006VA57CY|5.0|This is very good dramatic TV and well worth your while. I have watched many period dramas in my time. And often they are cheeky or just downright dull and lifeless. Downton Abbey is not cheeky, nor is it dull or lifeless. It is true to life, especially in the drama of life. It does not fall short, where, for example, \\"Remains of the Day\\" fell short. It depicts all humanity at its best and worst, during a period of time when two worlds collide, as they try to exist in parallel, the gentry and the servile. Robert Crawley (Lord Grantham) is a man caught between what was and what is coming. He tries to hold on to the old ways, whilst everything is changing all around him. He's married to an American aristocrat, who sees things much differently than he does -- she is more adept at navigating change (typical American). And of course, the servants in Downton Abbey seem more real and less romanticized or perfect -- Mr. Bates being a prime example.

1449410243|4.0|I love The Oatmeal, so if you enjoy the website you will definitely enjoy this book.  This type of humor is not for everyone, but since I like quirky stuff that doesn't take itself too seriously, it works for me.  I've been pleased with my purchase content/humor wise, and think this would make a good gift.  Though I wish the cover was made of slightly firmer paper, the overall quality of ink/paper/printing is very high.

B0091Q82L8|3.0|Did anyone actually buy that super-dooper deluxe issue just to get this show? This is OK, but I cannot believe that they had the nerve to dangle it in front of people and make them pay a bribe of another copy of Live at Leeds (with another live Tommy no less, ugh). The fact that Townsend burned many of his tapes but the bootleggers decided to keep theirs shows these artists can be really out of touch with their own work. I wonder what Townsend would pay for a tape one his own shows?  Or maybe even a copy of one his LPs off the original vinyl or cassette? I wonder when Crimson,Tull, and the Stones(post '70) are going to give up this kind of marketing non-sense and just issue really good sounding CDs of their work...

B0047WNLJO|3.0|Babylon A.D.(released Aug/08)stars Vin Diesel,an almost totally unrecognizable Gerard Depardieu,and others in this futuristic yarn.I was expecting alot more from this film,something closer to or on a par with his Riddick films,but I was sorely disappointed.<br />The plot is all over the map and can be hard to follow,but here is what I gleaned from it.Van Diesel,in 2019,is a mercenary for hire.This is a world that is in utter chaos,with countries fighting countries like never before and people relying on no one but themselves to survive.Vin Diesel,once a U.S. citizen,has been forced to survive in now war torn Russia.The streets are chock full of merchants selling death of every description.The film starts out in the now,but we go back six days to the circumstances that led up to that point.Vin Diesel was hired by a local Russian mobster(Depardieu)to get a young girl raised in a convent to NYC.Even though Van Diesel has no passport,he is given one to get her there.The mobster in turn has been paid by the girl's \\"father\\"/creator to ensure her safety.It seems her \\"father\\" genetically engineered her years before but the woman who paid him to do it,and who now runs a powerful religious sect,the Neolites,wants her back.The \\"father\\" squirreled the girl away in a convent in Russia until the proper time came.The \\"proper time\\" means the girl who Vin Diesel must escort to New York is now pregnant;done so with no outside\\"help\\".This is a \\"miraculous conception\\" the religious leader wants back,to show the world and become ever the more powerful.<br />Vin Diesel escorts the girl and her caretaker with him across Russia.They are dogged all the way by both Neolites and the girl's \\"father's\\"men.They finally make it to the Pacific coastal area where a sub picks them up and they are transported across the Bering strait to Canada.From there they travel by air to NYC.Once there they are awaiting instructions in a hotel room.They learn that the convent back in Russia has been blown up with all killed.Vin Diesel now knows he and her caretaker will also be dispensed with.Once instructions come they escort the girl to a car.The Neolites line one side of the street,while the girl's \\"father's\\" hired people line the other.At the last moment Vin Diesel grabs the girl in an attempt to escape.The girl survives but her caretaker is killed and Vin Diesel himself is shot dead,by none other than the girl herself.She says she wants him alive,as she shoots him.This is the point at which the movie began.<br />Vin Diesel IS brought back to life by the girl's father and bio-mechanically enhanced due to tissue and bone loss.The Neo-lite leader kills the Russian Mobster then turns her attentions towards the girls \\"father\\".Vin Diesel and the girl escape,but she dies and Vin Diesel is left to raise the children on his own.<br />The story,as I said,is all over the place,and the film has its work cut out for itself by trying to tie all the ends together,in the short 95 minutes it has to tell it all.Trouble is I do not know if it totally succeeds,and in the meantime some of the story tends to get lost in the translation,so to speak.I watched both film versions and besides a little extra footage and slight ending alterations,there is nothing significantly different in the two at all.Neither is clearer in execution than the other.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.There are no extras to speak of.This is the one disc two sided edition(so watch out for scuffing and scratching)which contains both the theatrical edition and the uncut editions.There's about a 10 minute difference.<br />All in all a disappointment.I was expecting more from the plot,but it was really an uneven hodge-podge.Possibly the editing could have helped,but there was such a lot of story packed into such a tiny time frame,that all the tweaks in the world may not have been able to help it.2

B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|Surrogates(released Sept/09)stars Bruce Willis as Greer,Radha Mitchell as Peters,Rosamund Pike as Maggie Greer,Jack Noseworthy as Miles Strickland,James Cromwell as Dr. Lionel Canter,Ving Rhames as The Prophet,and others.It is a solid cast working with a very imaginative story that can sometimes be a bit overwhelming with what it has to impart within its' &lt;90 minute time frame.I saw this film in its theatrical debut and that is the first impression I got,but having viewed it again after all this time I was able to digest some of the finer points I missed the first time around.<br />The story has our world in the future and most of the population runs their \\"lives\\" through surrogates,or remote controlled robots.You can be a man controlling a woman,or visa versa,or have a surrogate looking similar to yourself;the possibilities are endless.Of course there are those who do not believe that surrogates are a good thing and they are called Dredds,who live in cordoned off communities.The man who rules over these Dredds is called the Prophet(Rhames),and is quite militant when it comes to his \\"untouched\\" turf.<br />The story begins as the son of the inventor of surrogates is killed by a rogue carrying an awful weapon.The weapon not only fries the brains of the robots but the virus it implants also goes beyond safety protocols and fries the human brain.Greer(Willis)and his partner are FBI agents on the job investigating the crime.They soon discover the perp behind it all and the hunt is on.<br />Greer,in his surrogate,is in a helicopter above their man who is trapped in an alleyway,at the end of which are five cops.The cops are killed by the weapon and Greer's copter pilot also.Greer's surrogate is fried and Greer himself barely escapes getting killed.The copter goes down in Dredd territory and Greer/his surrogate almost gets his man,but is shot by one of the communities members,and gets away.The rogue ends up in the hands of the Prophet,i skilled,and now the Prophet has the deadly weapon to wield as he will.<br />Greer goes to the military telling them of the weapon he is after and they admit to its' previous usage.However they long ago scrapped the weapon because of its' unintended consequences,but obviously someone got a hold of one.The military make a raid on Prophet's compound and takes him and his guards down.We find that Prophet is nothing but a surrogate himself who is being controlled by none other than surrogates inventor,Dr.Cantor.Greer also learns it was his own boss that gave the weapon to the rogue.His boss was being paid by the company that manufactures surrogates,VSI,to take down Dr,Cantor(the reason they killed his son in the beginning of the film,to get to him).Dr Cantor we have already learned left VSI several years earlier because of his opposition to the entire surrogate program.<br />Now Dr Cantor has taken control of Greers partner's surrogate and has entered the main computer control FBI center.The surrogate hooks the weapon into the system and starts a viral download intended to finally end surrogacy and kill the people who operate them;multi-millions.At the same time Greer,in person,has forced his way into Dr Cantors house and has found HIS control facility.Before Greer can stop him,he swallows a cyanide pill and dies.Greer sits in the doctors chair and begins to control his partner's surrogate.With the help of the terminal operator who has been tied up,he manages to buffer the effects of the virus against the human component.Now all he has to do is press yes to kill the virus and save the robot surrogates,or press no and let the virus destroy the surrogates.He waits and waits until a bullet from a storming SWAT-like team member takes the surrogate down.Because of that the surrogates are all destroyed,everywhere,and Dr Cantor's scheme/mission, inadvertently in death,is still carried out;just not with the intended consequence of all the operators dying.The film fades as the news of the surrogate destruction gets splashed over all the TV networks.<br />The film raises some interesting philosophical questions about people and society and where we are headed in this age of computers that run so much of ours lives,even now.Wonder if one day we had no computers?This gadget has taken one on one personal contact and pushed it onto the back burner.The film takes us into the future and now personal contact is even far less than that;so rare in fact that many are unable to function if they're not using their surrogate.To show this the film at one point has Greer walking outside in the mostly surrogate populated streets,and his anxiety level is through the roof.A nice touch.The film has a kind of \\"I,Robot\\" feel to it too,though is not nearly on the same quality level,with even Cromwell in again as a brilliant scientist.<br />The film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is a commentary track.<br />All in all it is a film I found to be much better on a second viewing.First timers will,like myself,find it a bit overwhelming in detail,and there is the point to be made as to why it should take a second viewing to \\"get it\\".However,it is an imaginative script and Willis is on game in this one.The CGI is also top notch.Recommended.3 1/2- 4 stars.splashed over all the TV networks.<br />The

B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I didn't think we'd have much interest in this type of series, but to our sons urgings we checked out Season 1 and 2.  We got really wrapped up in it but needed to watch the first couple episodes of season 3 in order to catch up to the current showings on Sunday evenings.  So we were able to download these from Amazon.  Thankfully!  Now we're all caught up.  Thanks Amazon.

B0098VXBIA|2.0|What to expect-when you're expecting(released May/12)tries to be a hip,on the edge and with-it comedy about couples and their journey to having a baby.The film stars the likes of Jennifer Lopez,Dennis Quaid,Chris Rock,Cameron Diaz and others.Truth be told,this film is as boring and unfunny a film I have seen in a long time.If you liked Bridesmaids(I didn't),then you might like this;and that is a very big might.<br />The story centers around five couples,some married,others not,and their individual stories from just getting pregnant to their ultimate hospital deliveries.Mixed into this is a set of four fathers who wander Central Park(one is Chris Rock),babysitting their children and waxing on about the politically correct manor in which new fatherhood is conducted these days.They have a friend who is a bachelor(who comes and goes)and whom they fondle over,left,right and center,because he represents their lost bachelorhood.One young couple accidentally conceive a child but it is lost within the first trimester.Another couple(Lopez)goes to Ethiopia to adopt.One woman is an authoress on the magic of giving birth and she goes through the most difficult pregnancy of them all.Another is the very young wife of a race car driver(Quaid)and her pregnancy is the easiest of them all.The last lady(Diaz)has a weight loss TV show and her pregnancy is not what one would expect of a woman in her shape.The whole moral of the film is that there is nothing written in stone on how pregnancies in general turn out.Each one is an individual journey.And we had to have a 110 minute yawn-fest of a movie like this to tell us that!? And if there is anyone out there who truly believed that Ben Falcone was the son of Dennis Quaid,raise your hands.I thought so,not one.<br />The film is totally uneven,jumping from one story to another.And all the couples of course have to have some discourse running through their relationships.The discourse,of course,will take time to resolve,but in the end all will be well,and it is.And in between it all,let's play up the moronic and dysfunctional relationship of all the Central Park fathers and make it look like it is all really funny.Oh yes,and don't forget,let's really show how extreme the pregnancies can be,but make sure they are not what the audience would expect from each of them.That will give it more punch and hilarity.This is like Hollywood 101 here,but done sooo poorly.I could do a paper on this subject,but the lack of REAL and funny humour,and what passes for so-called humour,in movies these past few years.Jokes are so shallow and real gags are becoming non existent.\\"Humour these days seems to have been written by a bunch of frat boys high on something or drunk on anything.I don't know who is worse;the ones who write this tripe or the ones who are putting it in their movies THINKING it is funny.This movie,as do many others of their ilk,stand as anathema to what true humour is all about.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes and the trailer.<br />All in all a very big disappointment,involving a good cast with so very little to work with.The majority of the\\" humour\\" falls flat and the pace and unevenness of it has the film working against itself every second that ticks by.be well,and it is.And in between it all,let's play up the moronic and dysfunctional relationship of all the Central Park fathers and make it look like it is all really funny.Oh yes,and don't forget,let's really show how extreme the pregnancies can be,but make sure they are not what the audience would expect from each of them.That will give it more punch and hilarity.This is like Hollywood 101 here,but done sooo poorly.I could do a paper on this subject,but the lack of REAL and funny humour,and what passes for so-called humour,in movies these past few years.Jokes are so shallow and real gags are becoming non existent.\\"Humour these days seems to have been written by a bunch of frat boys high on something or drunk on anything.I don't know who is worse;the ones who write this tripe or the ones who are putting it in their movies THINKING it is funny.This movie,as do many others of their ilk,stand as anathema to what true humour is all about.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes and the trailer.<br />All in all a very big disappointment,involving a good cast with so very little to work with.The majority of the\\" humour\\" falls flat and the pace and unevenness of it has the film working against itself every second that ticks by.

I definitely didn't see the plot twist coming until it was revealed toward the end, which made for a nice surprise.

031618201X|5.0|Travel back in time to Victorian London - though not quite the Victorian London you learn about in your textbook. As well as people, vampires and werewolves are members of society - but the threat are the roves, the individual vampires and werewolves that are not as civilized as the others. Enter Alexia Tarabotti and her deadly parasol - not to mention her touch, one that neutralises supernaturals, all due to the fact that she has no soul. Roves aren't the only concern on Alexia's mind, though: a suspicious new club in town, and the fact that she is still not married! A handsome alpha werewolf, while pulling Alexia out of various reputation-wrecking troubles, could take care of that problem.<br />Beautiful artwork accompanies an engaging story to produce this book - a great read. Victorian fashion comes to life before your eyes with the artwork, and the story keeps you turning the pages.

I liked Lexy and the very cute cop who believed in her. I really liked Lexy's Grandmother and her friends. That's how I like to think I will be when I'm that age. I thought that the author including the recipe for 'Lexy's Famous Cupcake Tops' was a nice addition to the book. All up, very enjoyable read.

037571457X|5.0|Love it this book helped me a lot ans was on good conditions so it was perfect it :) :)
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Love this series and all the special effects, the rawness of the era is believable. Glad to see the way the Blood and Sand series evovled.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Thought this would be another just so Alien Invasion, but was surprised at the well thought out story line. Also, was impressed with the makeup of the Aliens ...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My friends at work were raving about this series. And being the one person that works there without cable I purchased the last two seasons here on Amazon after watching the first season on Netflix.<br />I am always excited to get the email letting me know that the newest episode has been added to my Amazon Library :)<br />Thank you Amazon !
B0077ZNCE2|3.0|The movie seemed to drag on.Yeah the wedding was nice but the rest was a snorefest at least until the wolves went to do what I'm sure almost everyone else has wanted to do by now,kill that dumb broad.The next one should be better and if it's not,at least it will be the last.The whole story was not that bad but just get it over with already,it had way to much build up and kinda just didn't deliver.but that's just my opinion.Maybe part 2 will be better,there.'s suppose to be a big fight,yea! Now I'm really glad I waited to read the books cause that can make the movie seem lame if you read them first and this didn't need any help.
B000FA5STS|5.0|It kept me on my seat. I was wondering what was going happen on every up and coming page. Thank you for the good book.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When we first started to watch this series could not believe how amazing the effects were. Enjoyed the story and could not wait to get more. Have all the series now.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|first season was awesome i was hooked after the first episode and have been watching it ever since I have really enjoyed this show
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's just a collection of new screens a bit harder.  Most defy physics.  Are luck.  Time killer. That's a good thing too.
B005K17RU0|4.0|nice app, works well but has been a bit off lately with the forecasts..Very User friendly however an stays running without glitches.
B009XY97VC|4.0|Okay, so I know most people will give TSFH 5 stars no matter what, but when compared to their other albums, I found this one somewhat disjointed and lacking.  Am I saying, \\"Don't buy it.\\"?  No, don't get me wrong there are some great pieces in here, but when I compare it to Invincible and Archangel, this one is lacking.  My opinion is that the best pieces of the album are:  All Is Hell That Ends Well, Skyworld, Juggernaut, Icarus, and Blizzard.  They seem to have gone a little overboard with the voices in this album.  I don't know where Back to the Earth came from.  That piece does not fit with the album at all.  Here is my review of each specific piece (Star rating scale 1-5):<br /><br />1) All is Hell that Ends Well - excellent piece.  It has a bit of a horror feel that escalates with a nice techno splash at the end - 5 stars<br />2) Titan Dream - I envision riding a horse across long distance to deliver a critical message or to assist friends in battle.  Not crazy about the voice. - 3 stars<br />3) Skyworld - What comes to mind is capitalism, innovation, battle in the business world.  The horns at the end add a good punch. - 5 stars<br />4) El Dorado - definitely some old world sounds, but modernized with some synthesizer.  Swashbuckler adventure. - 4 stars<br />5) The End is the Beginning - What comes to mind is an evil being resurrected.  Not crazy about the voices - 2 stars<br />6) All The Kings Horses - A duel of rapiers.  Nothing exciting at all. - 2 stars<br />7) Realm of Power - King oriented attainment of power.  - 3 stars<br />8) Winterspell - sounds of Carmina Burana at first then shifts to swashbuckling.  - 2 stars<br />9) Blackheart - violin is beautiful.  I don't hear so much a \\"blackheart,\\" but a wrestling though confusion.  Voices at end not bad. - 4 stars<br />10) Juggernaut - Bold start.  Purely epic battle sequence. - 5 stars<br />11) Dark Ages - In my mind hordes of eveil getting into battle formations.  Lightens at the end a bit, with good forces coming in.  - 3 stars<br />12) Our Last Hope - Strange Intro.  Too dark for \\"hope.\\" - 2 stars<br />13) Icarus - the conditioning and training of a hero.  I love the ascending progression.  - 5 stars<br />14) For the Win - Wonderous.  A light hearted struggle or competition. - 4 stars<br />15) Sun & Moon - mood music.  Voices are strange.  Not much musical variety.  - 2 stars<br />16) Big Sky - ancient, possible native american influences.  Decent song.  - 3 stars<br />17) Starfleet - Good music.  Nice sound particularly at the end, but lacks some quality I cannot define.  - 3 stars<br />18) Queen of Crows - in a foreign land.  Very nice music.  Deepening at the end is good. - 4 stars<br />19) Blizzard - a struggle in the trenches.  \\"Blizzard\\" is an appropriate title. - 5 stars<br />20) Breathe - has an \\"Inception\\" sound to it, but in my mind I see heros returning from a battle or quest and smiling at each other.  Voice at end took a star away. - 4 stars<br />21) Back to the Earth - Awful.  What is this song?  VERY BAD!  It has no place on this album! - 1 star<br />22) Ocean Kingdom - official sounding.  I see an emissary being sent to a foreign land.  This song sums up the album in general. - 3 stars<br /><br />I know some will disagree, but that is my $0.02.<br /><br />Update:  I find that I come back to several of these tracks and like them quite a bit.  The ones I come back to are still the ones I highlighted that I liked in the review above, but because I keep coming back to them, I upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This movie was good, it had a lot of action scenes  that followed  the concept of the concept of the movie. Also it had a lot of funny points and great looking men. all in all a good movie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start reading the book, you can't put it down. Once you finish one book, you have to move on to the next one. This is a great read!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book sooo much!!! I can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out!! It's a must have for sure.
0670026182|5.0|I did not know of Katie Quinn Davies's blog before buying this book, I bought it purely off the reviews and the cover shot.<br />Since buying the book I visit her blog regularly and am amazed at the talent Katie has in that she writes the recipes, cooks, styles and photographs the food, simply awesome!<br />I also see that she is a regular contributor to Australian food magazines which is a huge recommendation in itself!<br />As to the food, well I love home cooking and entertaining and \\"What Katie Ate\\" ticks all the boxes for me, the recipes are fantastic, everything<br />I have cooked so far has been a huge hit with friends and family, my 3 favourites so far are the \\"Creamy Macaroni Bake\\" page 155,<br />\\"Pearl Barley Salad with Harissa Spiced Chicken\\" page 85 and \\"Katie's Fish Pie\\" page 188. As to the photography and style of the book, I<br />think the realness of the pictures  is superb they make you want to cook the food straight away and I really like the old feel of he book, like I have had it for years and years.<br />I really hope that this is the first of many cookbooks to come from Katie Quinn Davies.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  At first I thought it was a chick-flick<br />and wouldn't like it but I was wrong.  A great date night movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|Extremely pleased with this purchase.  I love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy!  This is a great purchase.  Highly recommend it to anyone who is a romantic.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Even though I knew the outcome of this incident, before reading the book, it was interesting to see inside the life of the Navy Seals. I would recommend the book to anybody who enjoys an action packed novel with a very good ending.
B005D81W5Q|4.0|good blu ray. funny. i liked it. thank you again.cool thanks good wonderrful good blu ray. funny. i liked it. thank you again.cool thanks good wonderrful
B008BD9SI8|4.0|I am a great fan of Joe Abercrombie and look forward to all his books. I consider his \\"the first law\\" trilogy to be amongst the best fantasy novels ever. Therefore it shouldn't be surprising that all his subsequent books, whilst enjoyable, have left me a little disappointed. He has simply set the bar too high and all his subsequent works suffer in comparison to \\"the first law\\".<br />\\"Red Country\\" is the best of Abercrombies stand-alone novels. The plot is clever, particularly with the 'wild-west meets medieval world setting'. I found it a bit slow to start but it later became a great page turner and by three quarters of the way through it was well on its way to five stars. Then things suddenly changed. Earlier in the narrative there were hints of information about the underlying mythology of these books and their settings, particularly concerning the maker Kanedias. Then all anticipation was swept away in an orgy of blood-letting and destruction. Interesting characters,full of sympathy and potential, were callously dispensed with and what had had me hooked was gone. Gritty realism is all well and good but I genuinely believe he went a bit too far here.<br />Character wise, Abercrombie blends his old formula of bringing in new characters with focusing more on an old favourite. Numerous other characters from previous books populate the supporting roles. For me, it is the supporting characters who stand out, old and new. The main characters are a little bit one dimensional and just don't hit the heights of his previous works.<br />In the end I liked it, but certainly didn't love it. If you've read 'the fist law' this book will probably disappoint. if you haven't it stands alone well, but isn't outstanding. At times the story tantalises but in the end just doesn't deliver.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought it was interesting and enjoyed being able to get the facts first hand from someone who was there.  I do not trust the media in the US to give me the truth and nothing but the truth.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i really enjoy this game alot, i end up getting addicted to it when i start i have to make myself put it down!
B005IEF27O|5.0|Absolutely think this is a fantastic album!  I've been a jazz geek for the last year or so (after almost 40 yrs of rock), and listened to Primus for the first time recently.  This is just about my favorite album these past couple of years!  Love it!!!<br /><br />EDIT - I have now listened to other Primus albums since I loved this one so much.  I have to say I don't understand any review less than a 5*s for this one...  This album, being my first Primus foray, also seems to be the most accomplished and interesting.  Not that I haven't enjoyed the earlier ones (I've listened to 3 others), but this one is outstanding!  In league for best overall album of the year, decade maybe...
B000091F2N|5.0|This is the best work from Warlock. The vinyl is a double lp set, great packaging. If your into metal and vinyl , this is  a must buy.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Very satisfied!!!!! Works as described and it is great to have in case of power outages. Reasonably priced as well
B008D28HYS|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. I even have my 9-yr old daughter playing the easier levels. Need more expert and advanced puzzles though. I have solved them all. Great logic game. Thank you developers!
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I enjoyed the CD but thought it would have been better. Maybe the next one will be much better than this.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|I don't normally read crime fiction, but this appealed. Very enjoyable, especially in the way that the setting cast an inexorable, bleak and yet beautiful quality onto the story. I shall read the next one.
B0036SXQEA|5.0|There are films we watch to forget about life, then there are films we watch to learn about life.  This is the latter.  It is a character journey depicting the interconnectedness and randomness of organized chaos which actually brings everything together as by some divine force.  Coincidence?  Or predestined purpose?  Are we all interrelated?  Who are we?  Why are we hear, and why do we make these terrible mistakes?  Is there some greater purpose to our suffering? Perhaps, we are being led down the path of destiny?  These are all questions posed by the brilliant P.T. Anderson and his incredible cast.<br /><br />Settle in for this one, it is not a short movie, but a modern epic of emotional and dramatic proportions.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is amazingly entertaining for both the young and old alike.  I love it!  I think that anyone would be satisfied with this app!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is addicting and pretty fun! But u only get a certain amount of coins and the gutters should be smaller. But i talked my friends into getting it so i enjoy it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|pretty fun game. so far no need to spend my own loot to enjoy so 5 stars from me!!! sometimes it feels like you'll never get those coins over but the wait for new ones isn't very long.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great way to waste time :-) if you are looking for something to do while waiting in line, this is your game
B008E6I1K8|5.0|Outstanding book. A full good-described reference about the language and framework. If there is a low price update to new editions I will defenetely do it
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition 5.0 is out but not on kindle other than that it's a very good app 5.0 added glowstone to.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I cried from the first page.  My heart broke at times, but as dog lovers know, these fuzzy creatures heal broken hearts.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The second season of Sherlock does not disappoint.  The actors are brilliant.  I am an educator and I have a lesson centered around the \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" where students can compare and contrast Moffat's choices for his modern adaptation.<br /><br />Initially finding out about the series, I was nervous about it being modern.  However, coming from the BBC with their reputation for very much preserving the English classics I tried it out.  I think that it is very true in spirit yet still manages to be original and fresh.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I did a lot of research of a lot of bags before I bought a new book bag. Let me just say I have never been happier with a book bag than I am with this one! It really is beautifully thought out and designed !<br />I use it for both school, and when I fly home to visit family as my carry on, and it truly makes my life easier Andorra<br />Organized !!<br />Every pocket is easily accessible, from the hard case at the too for your cell phone , to my favorite part that pulls out and u can slip a sweatshirt or a paper into. I also love the side pockets for drinks , they are slanted in a way that when u are wearing the bag u can reach back and pull a drink or (umbrella etc ) out easily but still keeps those items secure! The material is great and although I have only had it a few months I feel that is will be around for a while :) !<br /><br />Lastly while reading reviews I saw that some woman said the bag was too large for them and g<br />Felt uncomfortable if you are petite, and I am 5'3&#34; and this is the most comfortable back pack I've ever owned ! It is<br />Padded very well on the back and shoulder pads , but not in a bulky way!<br /><br />I would definitely  buy this again!!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|I love all of Jane Austen's books, and I've read this before. Certainly not her most artistic work, but definitely a super-cute story and full of the wit for which she is known. Sarcasm, intrigue, and more :) Love it!
0525958002|4.0|This was a good read, it brought back memories of my obsession in the 80s of Duran Duran. I would have liked to hear a little more about his current life. There were only a few short chapters but overall I was glad to read it. After reading Andy Taylor's book, it was nice to read John's and I hope more of the band members write a book too.
B007HJ91HU|2.0|I don't understand why this movie was even made.  It's almost an exact word by word, scene by scene, camera shot by camera shot...remake.  Just watch the original, it has much more charm and heart than this one.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it dose not let me do multy player! !!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:( I am going to try one more time but if it dose not work I am going to say : this is a rip of
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I was looking forward this highly rated calculator AP on my new Kindle HD, but have had great difficulty putting it to use.  Due to the sensitivity of the screen, even with a protective film, a number will register if my finger is anywhere close to it.  I don't know if a stylus is the solution, but prefer a calculator AP that I can use without one.
B000000OF6|1.0|Freddy Mercury had the best vocal voice of all time, but he used his talent to drag men's souls to hell with songs like Bohemian Rhapsody. In the song he sings Beelzebub[satan] has a devil set aside for me, for meeeeeee! Well that is only if you haven't found the Truth, Jesus before you die. Life and death is in the power of the tongue and if you sing along that satan has a devil set aside for you what are you confessing. Satan was an angel of music in heaven before he was thrown out. Now he's influencing `Rock' musicians with `excellent' spellbound music in a final onslaught against God before He gets thrown into the lake of fire. Do not be deceived by beautiful lyrics that will lead your soul in rebellion against God, receiving the wages of unrighteousness which is eternal hell fire. Get the DVD's, They Sold their souls for Rock and Roll by Fight the Good Fight Ministries.
0553801473|5.0|Just like his first 4 books in the series, I found his 5th book intriguing & a great read.  However, it seems like another 5 books could be added to tell the \\"Rest of the Story\\", this time with a real ending.  I can only guess what the ending might be now.  I really hated to see Jon Snow get eliminated.  Surly, Mr Martin is going to write some more on these hanging endings of his saga!!
B0086700CM|5.0|First of all this game is awesome and second these people that are saying that you barely get any coins is wrong. When you run you collect the diamond shaped coins or points. Those diamonds are your coins. Just a little hint if you get temple run.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Fair and honest. Not all bad mouthing KISS but just enough to make it interesting. A lot about his personal struggles. Really enjoyed it more than Aces book.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Paranormal Agency is a unique seek-and-find, easily understood but providing many hours of fun.  I will definitely be looking for other games from this company.
B005TZFZMO|1.0|Someone asked,' since when does lousy lyrics plus precanned music become platinum? The answer: Since the illuminati decides who's in and who's out. Artists who can further their NWO agenda are in and those who don't want to play their game their way is out or get killed like Michael Jackson etc. These people are deeply involved in the occult/Satanism so when you listen to their music you will become demonized or demon possessed as well. As the Bible says, `You cannot partake of the table of demons and the table of the Lord'. Decide today whom ye will serve, satan or Jesus, hell or heaven. In the end these people are all puppets of the puppet master, satan [aka Beelzebub, santa, lord of the flies, allah, prince of the power of the air, Lucifer, etc.] who are all hell bound. Flee even the appearance of evil. Yes, there is a highway to hell and there is a narrow road to heaven and few find it. The choice is yours.<br />The Holy Spirit just laid it on my heart to pray this beautiful woman right back into `innocence?' or into the loving arms of Jesus Christ, her maker. It's like one person pointed out, Rihanna was before she met J.C and the Illuminati a neat, descent, lovely person but the illuminati has changed all of that. Let's all stand together that God will turn this woman's heart away from satans devices and stardom towards the praises of God where there is true light. She's going to stand the one moment singing illuminati, morally degrading songs by herself and all of a sudden she's going to start singing songs to Jesus who's going to set her free from demons! Jesus said `where 2 or more agree on something as important as saving someone's soul, He will do it. If you can believe, all things are possible to him who can believe'. God is not a liar. What makes her/songs attractive is her childlike innocence that Jesus gave her, not the devil and the illuminati who messes everything up.  Now for all of you who are against what I say who loves sin and carnality, consider the outcome and fruit of your own worldview. Who made the beautiful mountains, forests, fruit, clean water, sexual purity, lovely food? Who gave Rihanna such a beautiful talent? It wasn't the devil or illuminati because they pollute the rivers, cut down the forests, promote sexual promiscuity, put MSG in your food and fluorite in you water and mercury in your teeth. Now a tree is known by its fruit. A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|It's a nicley designed App, lots of nice filing features and ability to arrange your files in segregated folders and such.  However, it runs very very slow.  Videos, and pictures load up slowly and grainy.  Transition from one pic to the next is slow and frustrating.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|I have always loved this movie...never bought it on DVD though.I am glad I waited.<br />The transfer to blu-ray is remarkable.The picture is as if watching on the \\"silver screen\\"..but the best improvement is in the audio.<br />This is a must buy for any old war flick afficiandos.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|NELSON DEMILLE IS THE MOST TALENTED WRITER EVER, AND HIS CHARACTER, JOHN COREY, IS ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL AND REALLY FUN TO READ.  I HAVE READ ALL OF MR. DEMILLE'S BOOKS, BUT HIS EXCEPTIONAL TALENT OF CREATING JOHN COREY IS TRULY A WONDER.  I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEDAY THEY WILL BRING HIM TO LIFE IN CINEMA.  JUST A TEN STAR BOOK IN MY OPINION.  TRULY LOVED IT.
1609611543|3.0|Great theory, but hard to implement. Worked for a couple of weeks, then hit a 12 pound wall. Stayed on the wheat free, but to no avail.
B0018S6YO4|1.0|This album is about a good girl [Rihanna] who got involved with JC, Beyoncy [The illuminati croud] And who turned from the narrow good way of following Jesus to following satan and the illuminati puppets on the broad road that leads to hell. If you would like this pretty mistress to take you to hell as well, then listen to her music. What are those songs really talking about, like umbrella? Who truly is the rain man, etc? Do your own research on you tube.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Saw it in theaters and just knew that we would buy it and view it again.  It is a long enough movie that you don't feel overwhelmed with the star-studded cast.  They do well to make a good story.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really love this game.  I been looking for roleplay game and found it. wish your earn credits a lot fast.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|great fun and many levels to work through. graphics are fun and engaging. a great way to pass time. very entertaining.
B0043D2L9S|4.0|Amazon by Adorama, I'm happy with the harness for the gear I carried on a shoot. And will be using it on more field work. But, there is always a but. Trying to figure out how this was going to work took a lot of time on Lowepro's site with no help. Worst site I've ever been on. I had seen another \\"Pro\\" working with the Lowepro Vest and after years of wanting to reduce weight, camera stuff, not me. I talked to him about his outfit. It looked good, easy to work from. That's why I bought the harness, belt, lens pouches and card wallets.<br />The two straps shown in the picture are for use with a backpac from Lowepro. But there is nothing to tell you this, believe me I looked. I looked at their Youtube video from Lowepro, in slo-mo and still couldn't see anything to show me what I had.<br />Wrote to Lowepro for help on what goes where. Got no reply. In asking a local dealer, that I've bought from for years, for infor on the gear, it was said that Lowepro was never very helpful. What was said, was \\" they're Never \\" helpful. Poor way to work in a shrinking field. I've been spending on photo-gear for fifty years, I'll soon have enough.<br /><br />I would not worry about Amazon for gear and I've made my share of purchases from Amazon with good feelings. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Blade Runner is quite simply, one of the finest Sci-Fi movies ever made. It is, in my opinion, one of the 100 greatest movies of all time, regardless of genre.<br />Count me as one of the minority who prefere the editions with the voice over narration. Blade Runner is epic, hauntingly beautiful, and truly stands the test of time.<br />There is simply no other film quite like it in movie history. I give it 5 STARS for the versions with narration and 4.5 Stars for the versions without it. Which ever way you prefere, Blade Runner is a classic work of art.<br />CSS
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game I highly entertaining and actually makes you think, unlike a lot of other games out there. I got the app when it was a FAOD, but I think it is well worth paying for. There are new levels added all the time.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|no hassles with this app whatsoever.  the camera that it unlocks on the fire hd has zoom and shading options.  the pictures are easily accesible from photos area of fire.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son has been having fun with this game and at times asks for \\"help\\" with it. No issues with the game not loading properly or anything. Everything seems to work just fine and it's a terrific FREE game. Big thumbs up.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is an intricate tale that spans generations... It's filled with family secrets, suspense, drama, scandal and lots of beautiful landscape. I almost feel like I have been near the ocean after reading this book. You think you know what is going to happen as the story builds and unfolds but you don't. Kate Morton was recommended to me by a friend and I fully intend to read every one of her books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent book! Can't wait for the next one! Was a good series to read after reading fifty shades but both books are totally different!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a great movie for adults and children ... is an amazing movie specially for growing kids losing the magic of Christmas ... You have to believe!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Easy to use  and helpful with reading .Nice material which can be cleaned easily. Putting my Kindle in my bag is safe now.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|Can't write reviews from the app itself, you must go directly to the desktop site to do this. I use it to find places of interest when I'm traveling but can't review the places one I've been there with this app.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Favorite app EVER! on this app u can make all different kinds of food, talk to all different neighbors, plus u can make your restaurant look like how u want it to look I mean sure u cant get some stuff but that's not the end of world :-D trust me u should get this app. besides it costs nothing to download it. and if u really don't like it just delete it. :-D :-)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love tho app! Free yet highly efficient! can't live without it, so easy to use. I love it so much I Just had to leave a comment. try it u won't regret it.
0765357151|5.0|This is a hugely absorbing and very intelligent read. What would happen if the world as you know it ended, and you were the last left alive? It's fascinating and I thoroughly recommend it. What a shame the recent Hollywood movie changed the ending, because it's incredible.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I bought the first book because someone said it was similar to 50 shades but more adult like and the writing style was much better. I gave it a try and FELL in love with Gideon Cross. Really wishing they would make a film about the books. Now the 2nd book just released a month or so ago and I had pre-ordered mine through Amazon for my Kindle and I was NOT disappointed! I stayed up all night reading because I physically could not put the book down (kindle.. same thing). I am SO frustrated that I read it so fast that I have to wait for who knows how long for book 3.<br />I recommend this to ANYONE who liked 50 shades!
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham at his best, very intriguing and amusing, not finished yet and I don´t want to get to the last page.<br />Looking forward for next release.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Good read, kept the interest thru the end.  Would recommend to any Cornwell fans or anyone looking for a good mystery novel
B0009P5YXO|3.0|But I'll tell you what it does do--it's very good at making noises and lighting up!<br /><br />It's a great replica to have on your desk and occasionally wave around and buzz people with, but it does have a few major issues. The screw that holds the emitter in has a tendency to shake loose and fall out, which means you have to tighten it again ant again. The bit at the end with the interchangeable pens is prone to falling off if you're not careful with it.<br /><br />That being said, it makes Doctor Who fans freak out when you pull it out of your jacket and buzz the doors with it while casually leaning on the automatic door opener button. Which makes it quite fun, though it must be used sparingly, due to its embarrassing tendency to fall apart.<br /><br />I gave it three stars for educational value due to the UV light and invisible ink marker. In the hands of a science teacher, the toy could be used as a demonstration of why certain things glow under certain wavelengths of light.
B009B50QOU|1.0|I will admit that I actually quite enjoyed \\"Let Yourself Go\\" when I first heard it.  It was a pretty good callback to Green Day's pop punk roots and was a lot of fun to listen to (despite some of the dumb lyrics).  This album, however, sounds very thin and there's no power in most of these songs.  And don't get me started on \\"Troublemaker\\"...  What an awful song, seriously.  Why in the world did they think THAT was a good idea?  I'll also admit that I wasn't really that fond of \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" either, but at least it sounded like they were trying to make something worthwhile on those albums, even if they weren't necessarily my cup of tea.  On here, it doesn't even sound like they give a crap anymore and are just going through the motions.  There doesn't seem to be any real emotion on most of these songs, save for \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"Rusty James\\", which are the only songs that really have any power in them to be quite honest.  The rest of this record is a freakin' bore.<br /><br />Not recommended, especially for first time listeners - get \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Insomniac\\" if you're just getting into Green Day and not this.
0812993292|5.0|This book has earned a spot on the shelf as one of the most unexpected hits I have read recently.  I thought that  story about a retired gentleman walking 500 miles to \\"save\\" an old friend couldn't have much in the way of plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by the heart and story that surrounded Harold Fry's long journey.<br /><br />The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry centers around the title character, an elderly man who is stuck in a life over which he doesn't feel he has control.  His marriage to Maureen is strained, his relationship with his son David is non-existent, and his life has little in it to distinguish one day from the next.  At breakfast one morning, though, Harold receives a letter from Queenie Hennessy, a former co-worker from his days at the brewery.  She explains that she has cancer and is dying, and wanted to say a last goodbye.  After years of not seeing her or hearing from her, Harold tries to write a letter to send his condolences, but he can't seem to get the words right.  Determined to send it off, he drafts a quick note and hurries out to the postbox.<br /><br />Upon arriving at the first postbox, however, Harold can't send the letter off yet - it just doesn't seem right.  So, he walks to the next postbox, and the next, until, realizing that he is hungry, he stops at a gas station for a snack.  He explains that he just heard of Queenie's cancer, and isn't sure what to do about it.  The young cashier explains that her aunt had cancer and the thing that helped her the most was having faith.  In a moment of insight, Harold comes to believe that if he has faith that Queenie will survive, she will, and he decides to set off for Burwick-upon-Tweed (over 500 miles north) on foot, confident that Queenie will survive until he arrives.<br /><br />With nothing more than a light jacket, his wallet and a pair of deck shoes, Harold sets off to see Queenie.  Phoning home, he announces his mission to Maureen (who in response to his plan declares, \\"I think not\\") and to the nursing home where Queenie is staying. Along his journey, he makes unexpected friends, learns about himself, and comes to better understand his marriage.  Although it is a solitary journey, and Harold doesn't have companions to speak of, I never felt that additional characters were needed.<br /><br />This story is powerful and I enjoyed reflecting upon what is really important in life as Harold overcomes obstacles and tests relationships.  Additionally, Harold's determination was incredibly inspiring (even though he is a fictional character, the power and voice with which he was crafted makes him so real and life-like that I was genuinely concerned for him at times and was unabashedly cheering for him at others).  The ending is completely unexpected and, like the rest of the book, is pitch perfect.  This is a wonderful story - the kind of book that you want to share with all of your friends because it is that good - and I am certain that Harold Fry will stick with me for quite some time.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Was everything I expected and more! Almost full sized head and sooo cool looking! Awesome details! Hope they come out with more for the other seasons
B009VB97EY|5.0|Magic Mike is hot!  Great dance sequences, hot men who can definitely get one hot and bothered, some quirky humor, what more could one ask.
B00133KFGW|5.0|fully enjoyed this emotional musical fantasy, as it draws us in and leads us through several moving experiences. it peaks at the end by uniting your emotions as the two loving parents and orphaned youth are united.
B009YX02T8|4.0|I LIKE moody. I'm not bothered by the absence of more upbeat songs, and was not expecting them either. The movies move along the story pretty quickly, so I don't think they'll spend much time on Bella's first months as a vampire. Even if they do, the Cullens are very preoccupied with and stressed about Renesmee's fast development during that time. Which doesn't leave a lot of opportunity for upbeat music. Since most of the songs are kind of moody...You might be better off just finding a way to get the Greenday song on it's own.<br />I love Fire In The Water, Ghosts, Heart Of Stone, Cover Your Tracks, New For You, and Speak Up. But again...I like moody music. If you don't, these songs probably aren't for you.<br />I like The Antidote, Where I Come From, Bittersweet, Everything And Nothing, and All I've Ever Needed. I'll add them to my iPod, but I probably won't have them on my favorites playlist.<br />The Forgotten by Greenday....I'm ok with this song. I wouldn't change the station if it came on the radio, I might even sing along, but I won't be adding it to my iPod. I don't think it really fit in with the rest of the soundtrack. I can't help but wonder if it's in there just because Greenday is a big name in music. I felt the same way about Bruno Mars being included in the last soundtrack. Did they put in the song because it worked with the movie, or did they just want to include a famous name in the soundtrack?<br />I'm a little miffed by A Thousand Years. I like it, but it's not much different from the original. Did they just want to change it barely enough to be able to include it on another soundtrack? It hasn't changed enough that I would add it to my iPod. I feel like I paid twice for the same song....a song I like, but I still don't want to buy it twice.<br />Carter Burwell is ok. Not my favorite composer though. The song is pretty. It just isn't a powerful enough piece for me...I was more impressed by the song used for the movie's trailer than I am by this song.
B008COD5OO|1.0|This movie was disgusting. The language was so foul I had to turn it off. My husband and I are in our early 20's and it was too much for us. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
B008K7RGA2|2.0|A truly vulgar and repugnant performance of the Romanian diva Angela Gheorghiu. In the first act she gets no applause from the British audience, notwithstanding her beautiful voice, as she was all over her partner with repeated French long kisses as an ordinary slut. In the second act, her breasts almost fell out of her flimsy dress as she bended over. Thanks goodness that with her hand she was able to cover her moving breasts. Yuck!
7799437278|5.0|great Christian themed true life movie; an inspiration to all. this woman reaches beyond tragedy and fulfills her heart desire of winning despite a seeming handicap. her drive and courage are an inspiration to all of us believing we have shortcomings. a reminder that in Christ we can do all things.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Brought this with me on a vacation where I had long bus rides. Kept me occupied and entertained throughout. Great book. I bought the next one and like it so far as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like this book because it's very sexual, and detailed. I hope she makes another book because she is an excellent writer.
0393327345|5.0|I bought this novel for a class that required it and I was not disappointed. The book was in great condition and very much enjoyable to read.
B0086700CM|4.0|its pretty good. I think most people would want it if they have a slow day, and its thoroughly addictive.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Finally, Lego created typical sets for girls. Friends series is very nice, girls have a lot of fun and evrything is very detailed. When your doughter will start with small sets, shortly she will be asking for more - very creative series and good toys to play with for long winter evenings (not only of course). I would says that \\"Friends\\" sets for girls are like Star Wars or Pirates for boys. Perfect for girls in age 7-12 years old.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Let's pretend this was a brand new album from a completely new band.  This album would be completely incomprehensible and mind-blowing to today's generations definition of rock music.  Unfortunately, many people are comparing this new CD to Soundgarden's past work - that is just simply unfair.  This record stands alone - both in today's music world and in Soundgarden's own catalog of music.  If you've only listened to this album once, do yourself a favor and give it a few listens before passing judgment.  Your appreciation will grow with every listen.<br /><br />At 0:20 of the 1st track, Been Away Too Long, the journey begins on this album.  The 1st song reminds me of what I missed about Soundgarden in the 1st place.  A Thousand Days Before would be the standout song for me, though Bones of Birds and Rowing would also be the other standout tracks.  In Bones of Birds, Cornell croons, 'hey, sometimes she won't cry, when the smallest one is drowned, too weak to survive, probably..maybe', and you will find yourself crooning this throughout the day as well.  Halfway There would be the weakest song on the album - it feels more fitting to Chris Cornell's Euphoria Morning.  If you're a Soundgarden fan or a rock/grunge fan in general and you're debating getting this album, get it NOW before you have to jump on the bandwagon after it wins a Grammy.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|I got this book for a book club.  I have never been so disappointed.  Sorry Ms. Moran, your book is just not for me (not my cup of tea...).  I will say that many of the ladies in my book club enjoyed the book and said they laughed alot.  I just couldn't seem to get into it.<br /><br />Happy reading.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|All books have a few pages in the middle that are a little dull.  But mostly this book stays exciting - last part is where you just CANNOT lay it down!  There are some surprises toward the ending that you would never expect.  Any more explanation would take away your enjoyment of this book.  To sum it up I would just say 'Great book and worth buying'!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting perspective, but short on \\"the beef\\" (details about what he learned while in his coma). Worth reading, but I had the feeling he was saving \\"the good stuff\\" for a second book.
0307361012|5.0|I've only listened to The Snowman before this one, but when I was browsing Audible for a mystery and saw Nesbo's name, I quickly decided to try The Bat, not knowing anything about the series.  I haven't even gotten to part two of the reading and here I am at Amazon to order the book.  This is in spite of Nesbo's use of the case - not a particularly interesting one, actually - as a backdrop for characters, setting, and dialogue.  In fact, I really don't care who killed the subject of the investigation.  The Bat far exceeds 99% of other detective novels in the brilliance of Nesbo's writing - and I'm thinking specifically of one by Michael Connelly that I returned to Audible after listening for about ten minutes.  The characters, primary and minor, are presented as people who aren't merely helping the story along, and the way he develops the characters of Harry Hole, Andrew Kensington, and the love interest (can't tell how to spell her name from hearing it) makes me care about and want to know them outside of the book.  I've chuckled several times at the dialog, which isn't cliche and is clever in just the right places. Nesbo's descriptions of settings verge on poetic (in a good way) and he doesn't pile on information about characters' appearances.  (Connelly gave extensive page space for details about what everyone was wearing - in one case it was only \\"she had on a white blouse,\\" for Pete's sake!)  I can \\"see\\" how characters respond to what happens to them and what's going on around them.  To summarize, if you value good writing about a crime investigation, buy this book!  I'm a screenwriter, and listening to The Bat has started me thinking about adapting it for film. (And by the way, if you want a good listen, download the book from Audible.  The narrator is OUTSTANDING and perfect for the story.
0553103547|5.0|The writing style is very unique and keeps readers interest easily. A lot of books out there are written in this time period, but this one is by far the best. No questions, just read it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It begins with deciding to be a Navy Seal, training and experience that leads up to the main mission.  Very informative and 'the rest of the story' that you have wondered about.  I may read again.  Everyone should buy and read this book! (Short and to the point!)
B0000039QA|1.0|this album and his other album are wack he one of the most overrated emcees.<br />in the beef 2Pac owned biggies Ass!
B007SGM084|1.0|I think it was boring, tasteless and in general, a waste of good paper.  You can only read so much trash before it becomes a bore.  I have to admit I skipped the biggest part of the books looking for a storyline.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I love this movie, it is a great family movie to watch. I bought to have more movies at home because we all know nothing is on t.v on Sat and Sun.
B000N2HCM4|3.0|Hard to believe everything as it was written by himself.  Doesn't clear up some questions I had about his birth and what made him eligible to be president.  Didn't explain very well his religious (or lack of it) background.  Wondered where he got money to do all he did and no mention of that.  It you want to read without getting answers to your questions, it is for you.
B00005AQE8|5.0|by far the best album of all time! followed by Makaveli and Me Against The World<br />Best Album and Best Rapper of All Time!

B005LAIGW8|5.0|Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but I loved the first one and cannot wait to see this one. I liked how the seller included a trailer for me to watch before I made the purchase.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|I have played the original version of Uno for a long time, me and my friends usually play Uno as a drinking game, wich is sooo much fun, but the cards get damaged some times when people no longer have control over their motions! When a friend of mine bought these Uno H2O and brought to a party I HAD to get them! No damaged cards and the game can go on and on... If something, especially something sticky, spills on the cards, you can just wash them right away or throw them into the dishwasher!<br />What a grate Invention!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'd never heard of this book before, but gave it a chance due to it's reviews and reasonable price. I wasn't disappointed.<br />It was a great read that takes place in an interesting world.

B008RXYOKY|3.0|I purchased this so I could use a FW800 external drive with my MacBook Air. It's a huge upgrade in speed and performance over a simple USB 2.0 connection, but the connection itself is not reliable. The cable doesn't snap into place or fit snugly, meaning that I've lost the connection from just slightly moving my Air. Certainly not the kind of thing that would fill you with confidence if you were regularly accessing data on that external drive. Hard to justify the cost for such a lack of reliability.
0425263916|5.0|The first book was great and I could not wait to receive the second! Would definitely recommend this item to anyone.

B004DK5CW4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie very much!! It is a great story of a horse with plenty of personality and courage. The actors were excellect. It is one of my favorite movies and from a person who does not buy many movies, I own it.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|They're digital. It doesn't matter that they landed on vinyl, they're digital. So those of you who prefer vinyl because it sounds better, well, it's not better it's just different.<br />Had these been derived from the tapes that might be an argument, and regardless there are some specialty digitization moves that Abbey Road didn't make - these are fairly standard digitizations on solid Pro gear, but nothing exotic.<br />Enjoy the vinyl, but realize that it's a digital recording you are listening to.<br />The fact that the Lacquer sounded warmer oughta be a clue - vinyl is a coloration that some people like, and they like the rounded edges from the limited transient speed of the cutter and the lacquer and the needle...<br />But they're digital.
1439152802|5.0|Morton's The Secret Keeper kept me guessing until the very end. Beautifully layered and deeply characterized, the story moves effortlessly from past to present then back again. If you enjoy contemporary fiction with historical underpinnings, this is a great read.
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|This band came up on my recommended list on Youtube so I checked out their single \\"Hunger\\" and I was...presently surprised. Amaranthe combines pop music with the symphonic metal with a dash of growling death metal and hits the puree button and makes it work. Very impressed. I'll be checking out more from them.
1433524619|5.0|The ESV has shown itselt to be an excellent translation of God's Word. Some passages may be less \\"flowery\\" than other translations and, in my opinion, written at a higher reading level. For example, \\"transient\\" is used in 2 Corinthians 4:18 instead of \\"temporal\\" in the KJV, and \\"temporary\\" in the NKJV and NIV and most others. \\"Transient\\" is more accurate as it means brief and passing away, but may be harder for some readers to understand.<br />The most pleasant part of purchasing this Bible was the free access it granted to the online ESV. This is a superb website that makes searching the Bible quick and easy. There are many free resources here, and more they'd like to sell you.<br />If I had it to do over again, I should have sprung for a larger print version instead of the Personal Size. The foot notes are in very small type and the paper is thin enough as to cause print on the opposite of the page to make reading the footnotes somewhat difficult. Disregard this if you do not need glasses to read.
B000002KKD|4.0|The B 52's-52's B<br />I arrived in London in 1979 for the first time to see Todd Rundgren / Utopia at the Knebworth Festival, and in every street I turned I saw a lot of posters with this bizarre group, which reminded me of the 50s. What a stupid record I thought, and it must suck hard.<br />I wonder why then arrived home, after 6 months I bought B52's and I fell in love, I found them innovative and I fo<br />llowed them in many stages of their careers,still today ............Never say never

B007C7UZIG|5.0|I use steam regularly so to see this app on the amazon market was great. I am synced up to my friends and I can even buy games and remotely install them onto my computer. Enjoy all the amenities of being on steam minus the playing PC games part.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|I really enjoyed the music in Skyfall, and was going to buy the soundtrack until I discovered that the theme song was not included. The theme song is part of the movie's soundtrack, and leaving it off the soundtrack CD is simply a ripoff. It's a great song, and I'll skip the soundtrack CD since it is not included.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this storyline. Much more in depth and the twists and turns are awesome. Really enjoying this season. Sp drawn in by the characters and their stories. A++ for AHS!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a very good game but the zombie mode can be very difficult I could barely get past wave seven. Also Amazon you really need to start putting commas into your devices keyboards.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I liked this latest book but it was not my favorite. It read like a set-up for the next book or an in-between book rather than a good solid Scarpetta novel. Interesting that the \\"getting old\\" theme is also in Skyfall.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|the unfortunate events book number one is about three children who's parents died and is now living with a man named Count Olaf.

B0042XA2U4|4.0|This is a prime example of a very good story that was gotten a hold of by Hollywood and turned upside down. I loved the story and ALL of the characters in this book. They all brought something special to Holly's situation and I think all had a small part in her recovery process. The people in this book are the center to it, you are invested in all of them not just Holly. You get excited that the man-eater is getting married and the other power couple in the group are bringing a little one into the world. That is what I think the movie got wrong, they didn't make it about all of their lives after Gerry died and so you missed what integral parts they all had in helping Holly come to terms. It wasn't depressing either, by the time the movie was over I felt like god if my husband ever dies before me I don't think I'll survive it but in the book seeing how Holly's friends and family rallied around her and how she was able to pick herself back up made me feel like it isn't something you can't survive, it's how you survive and who you have along the way.

B008MM9630|4.0|don't have to be online to play. looks great on kindle fire. very much enjoyable. would like more options without using crystals though.
1452110581|5.0|We have 2 cat lovers in the family so I got them one for their stockings. Great little book. Sounds like a cat.
0316228532|2.0|D grade is also for depressing. I never liked a single character in this book. They were either hopelessly drugged, stupidly silly, grossly featured, brutal mostly weak. The book reads like a page in the news about people you don't really know or care to know because their lives are so squalid. I was very disappointed by the ending which went even further to the depths of depression without any potential resolution except for the memory of one and only seemingly human person that died at the beginning of the book. Give it a miss and hope that J.K. Rowling can cheer up.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Being ex military but not combat arms I found this fascinating. It was a real eye opener in that allowed a real view into the life and the culture of the Seal Team. It portrayed a life of train or fight on an almost continuous basis for ten years. The Osama mission was just icing on the cake. A great read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I've been a Jetpack Joyride Player for about a month and I can't stop playing it! So much fun, and there is always something new to do. Whether or not its another gadget combo, trying to get achievements, leveling up, or just trying to get a new high score, the fun never ends!
B008S847X2|5.0|The recording is just as good as the previous, \\"...One.\\"  I particularly like the melodies (in the slow tunes) he / they play.  Loved the funk(iness) of the last tune and how it ended with the bell-type sound...<br /><br />A great CD from these musicians.
0060507772|5.0|Huge Discworld fan. A little hesitant to try this as I love the novels and was afraid I wouldn't like it, much like one of the book animated movies. However I loved it. Brilliant like almost all of the Discworld books and beautiful art that really captures the beloved characters. A must for any Discworld fan.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Personally, I thought Season 2 did drag on a bit with the &#34;GREAT SOPHIE HUNT !!!&#34;  But as far as the Blu-Ray set is concerned--are you kidding me !?!?!?!?  Can I say F*****G AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's all I have to say !!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game and play it all the time on Facebook and was so excited that I could get it for my Kindle Fire. BUT... its not the full game.  You can't play the tournament and the cities only go up to Cairo.  There do not seem to be any updates for the game.  Since I downloaded it they have added Berlin but it is not there. Rome and Moscow were already available in the Facebook game but are not there in the Fire addition.<br /><br />I love it, but I am a little disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really gets into the pyschology of people when their world is totally turned upside down.  Love the different levels of emotion from all the characters.  So many twists and turns.  So very believable. No one is safe, just like it would be in real life...
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series and can't wait until the second season is available.  Hopefully, there will be more character development in the new season.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes action and suspense.

B0063M22QO|3.0|Just an OK version of the game, I've seen much better apps out there.  Good game (the timed version) for airplane flights.
B0095R64AO|3.0|A great compromise for me and my wife. Jason Segel is always funny, but the rest of the movie isn't bad either.
B008O2T3O0|5.0|I will not pretend to be anything more than I am; unsophisticated, ordinary, but an opera lover for over 50 years.<br />I will not pretend to hear the brand of reed the oboe player used.<br />I will say however, that I have been many times to the old Metropolitan opera house in New York City. I had no money, so I would get in for $2.00 for standing room at the rear of the orchestra level.<br />I have heard Rigoletto many many times... Even with Leonard Warren as Rigoletto (toward the end of his career), followed by the famous Robert Merrill, and so on and so forth...<br />The Duke was sung by Jan Peerce, Richard Tucker, and many Tenors after him.<br />Gilda was Roberta Peters, and Anna Moffo and many more....<br /><br />This is all said by memory, and so it is I remember the music and the voices..<br /><br />I don't ever recall being moved so deeply as by this performance of Rigoletto.  I cried through two handkerchiefs and some tissues my wife supplied.<br />Since the disk does not offer subtitles, I dug into my old keepsakes and found the old Libretto that I bought for 75 cents at the Met, in the early 60s<br />I sat down to the best Rigoletto ever.<br />Everyone was superb. Gilda hit every note on target with passion. Rigoletto made me cry for two hours... A great Duke....<br /><br />The best $9.99 you will ever spend in your life.<br /><br />Buy two copies in case you loan one out and they wont give it back.<br /><br />Thank you for the opportunity to express my feelings.<br /><br />Fred Auerbach
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This was a good movie. Will most likely buy the books because it was so good. It pulled yo in to another world of a possible future.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|So glad I purchased the complete series.  Was a great value price too.  The acting is good, scenery great and stories keep you interested.
B0036EDVS0|3.0|Given the talent, it was disappointing that this movie could not decide if it was scary or comedic -- so it turned out to be neither...
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Why does ALL Angry Bird platforms, including this one, CONSTANTLY force close and restart?  Whenever an ad tries to pop up, it forces the game to restart.  For a company like Rovio, which has their brand EVRYWHERE (and tons of money)...you would think they would prevent s*** like this from happening.  Get your R&D team to this.  WTF?
B005ZUR724|5.0|though there seems to be quite a bit to be desired in the area of direction and training this rpg is truly an epic app for the kindle fire. the difficulty is a bit more than what I expected and unless you team together many of the quest are impossible and leveling up is difficult the evolution that this app will force others to follow is obvious. this app is fun interesting and unending.
044042321X|5.0|I have read the books, watched the tv shows, and now read the comic book. I liked the books the best, but this is a little better than the show. I like how the comics can illustrate the characters closer to Martin's thought on what they SHOULD look like, rather than finding actors to match with the characters.
1451695195|5.0|With a unique clarity of writing and thought, Dr. Alexander tells a story that is both amazing and riveting. Adding to the personal testimony of many who have experienced and written about Near-Death experiences, he now dedicates himself to a sharing of his journey and understanding. A courageous account full of clarity and conviction. Read this.
B009B50QOU|5.0|I thought this album was a great way to start the trilogy. It's a flashback to their 90s days, but still a very mature album. Its perfect

B0052RDHTM|4.0|very interesting saga of several families and the effect of WWI on their lives. I enjoyed learning which events lead to the war and the downfall of tsarist russia
B0016MZFXS|1.0|The clock on R2D2 is extremely small and the one that projects on the wall is both small and blurry. All in all it is not at all useable as a clock. It would be a great toy for my kids except it is extremely expensive and really doesn't do anything but make noise. Overall I wish I didn't buy it.
B0053O89KG|2.0|Well, here's a tough one.  First, Castle four shows are as good as all the other three seasons.  This is one of the best shows on TV.  Now, the bad part.  Each of the five discs always return to the same program watched after you watch it.  Takes an inordinate amount of time and manipulation to get to the next show you want to watch. Unfortunately I didn't read about Amazons policy about returning DVD's so by the time I had finished watching all the shows on season four, my time to return the package to Amazon, for a replacement of the defective package they sent me, is up.  So, I have three seasons of Castle that I can watch with no problem and one season, four, that is defective.  Thanks Amazon. Perhaps you should review and revise your policy on returning defective DVD's, at lease on an individual basis. Guess where I won't be buying season five or anything else from Amazon.<br /><br />Just received contact from Amazon's service representative.  They are accepting my return of this item and will be sending me a new copy.  What a pleasure it is to deal with a company that reviews problems on an individual basis and is not adverse to making wrongs into rights.  I'm certainly back on board with Amazon after this one. What a pleasure it is to deal with a reputable company.  Thank you all.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham did it again.<br /><br />A lot is happening and you want to know what is next. Full of surprises and very well written.<br /><br />I have hardly missed any of John's novels since the first one was was published.<br /><br />This one was the best.<br /><br />John keep writing I can't wait to read your new book.
0375714839|5.0|Persepolis is an interesting comic/book based on a girl's struggle during the Iranian revolution. It is a good read for all ages.
B004EAFQG0|5.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS!  I found this movie fascinating! It's a crazy and chilling story that, in an odd way, kind of has a happy ending. Even though I've never done anything even remotely close to what Angela did to Nev, I still sort of relate to her.  The scene where she describes how her different profiles were bits and pieces of what she used to be and wanted to be, etc., really touched me.  If you've ever been deceived by someone you'll relate to this movie.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|The BEST Zombie Movie of ALL TIME!<br />I Love it & Watch it all the time.<br />I have given away so many copies of this Movie because when I Loan them out, they never come back!
B008458O3S|4.0|Fun, tricky, game. Track can be a little fiddly to lay. Seems that you need to start a square before and swipe through each square.<br /><br />Only major annoyance is that it seems to be broken for nexus 7 with new android 4.2 update. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This story proved to be quite addictive. I finished the entire thing in less than two days; could hardly put it down. The characters were enjoyable. I found myself liking and caring what happened to them before even having finished the first chapter. That's not an easy thing to do, getting a reader invested in characters so early on. The story itself was suspeneful, emotional; just overall a great read. I'd definitely recommend it.<br /><br />My only real issue is that it is not necessary to follow every line of dialog with \\"he says\\", \\"she says\\", etc. That gets monotonous after a while. Its just a pet peeve of mine. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book or anything.
B007THA4FI|3.0|As an \\"ex-Brit\\" I understood the setting for the book. However, I can't imagine it being very interesting to anyone who is not familiar with the UK public housing scene. Although the book 'dragged' you along with the exploits of the various characters, I didn't feel as if it was really going anywhere. The fact that it all ends in a series of tragedies was uninspiring and not the ending I expected. Overall, it was somewhat disappointing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A dark page turner that has readers trying to figure out who did what, with a twisted love story intertwined. The author does a great job of keeping you guessing!

0316017930|5.0|The idea here is that opportunity and circumstance have a lot to do with success.  He has some interesting arguments about this, from the Beatles, to Bill Gates.  The idea is that 10,000 hours of practice is the threshold of mastery of a skill.  He is a very convincing storyteller.  It's also worth looking at [[ASIN:0747528306 Emotional Intelligence]].
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I had no idea it was a cartoon.  Tried watching it anyway.  Canned, hackneyed plot.  Kids five to twelve year olds will love it.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|I was skeptical about seeing a video game movie, honestly, and the advertisements for it were goofy, and not well done, but when you get into this movie you will see why I love it so much. This is the only movie I could actually watch 4 times in one week, and still be driven to feel for these characters in a deeper level every time. I plan to watch it again. It is just that good.<br /><br />The whole game is from the perspective of \\"the bad guy\\" which he tells you up front, but in such a tone, and with such a back story that you can feel the story will move away as its point of departure. Ralph is \\"a wrecker;\\" Every experience from there is nothing more than \\"the bad guy\\" doing everything in his power to do good things, all while struggling with the self-image he desperately wants to shrug off. Every consequence he brings in effort to change who he is affects all the members of the other games he is brought into, upsetting everyone in the process, until the climax of the game faces the destruction of the entire arcade, and reveals a hidden secret about another assumingly long-lost character acting as the antithesis of what Ralph represents. Ralph ends up having to call upon his own destructive abilities of his past that also reveals his true inner strength that gives him enough self-confidence to ultimately embrace the advice he earlier rejected to be--a \\"bad guy\\" who doesn't have to be a \\"bad\\" guy.<br /><br />By the end of the journey, Ralph never shrugs off the \\"wrecker\\" mentality, but he does discover that he can \\"wreck\\" a lot more than buildings: the stereotypes, and labels that are the walls to self-acceptance and self-confidence that open the doors to loving friendship. Ralph walks down a winding road to end up in the same place he started completely changed, and changing everyone else for the better alongside him.<br /><br />Hope that's been helpful, but now I've got to reserve my next ticket to see it again.
B000000I0D|4.0|No, Crises simply cannot stand in the same league as Five Miles Out or anything from the Tubular Bells-Fives Miles Out period, but it's certainly leagues better than that underwhelming Discovery disaster!  Much, much better.  I guess perhaps it's my fault for going into Discovery before Crises.  Not that it matters *that* much, and in fact I guess you can say I saved the better album (this one) for last.<br /><br />Anyway the title song is 20 minutes of... well, perhaps \\"adventure\\" really *is* the only way to describe it even though it should never be placed in the same category as the multi-part masterpieces from previous Oldfield recordings.  No, it's not *quite* as great as the 24-minute masterpiece \\"Taurus II\\" from Five Miles Out, but I wouldn't say it's a huge drop in quality either.  It sounds significantly more mainstream however, which hurts it slightly.  This means had it been shortened into an edited version, it'd fit in with, say, Pink Floyd's A Momentary Lapse of Reason and I wouldn't know the difference.<br /><br />Anyway perhaps my favorite part is when the rhythm picks up around the 4:30 mark.  It resembles the early 80's version of the Moody Blues a little bit, and that can only be a good thing.  Unfortunately all the compliments in the world can't help the fact that the vocal melody is sort of well, not very appealing.  Alright, it's not THAT bad.  I simply prefer my Oldfield experience to not include vocals.  Then again, the vocal melodies on Platinum were pretty awesome but that album added a lot more creative and diverse ideas than this one (added more by *far* in fact).  The mediocre way the lead singer sings \\"Crises, crises, you can't get away\\" is the worst part of the piece, but the next set of vocals (\\"the watcher and the tower, waiting hour by hour\\") is more pleasant.<br /><br />The final 10 minutes is a bunch of really dated 80's instruments that feel soulless and cold by todays standards, but luckily the fact they're melodic saves the day.At least for this album, even though I disagree with Oldfield's choice of arrangements, at least he had the good sense to lay his ideas down as interestingly as can be.  Overall, I'm pleased with \\"Crises\\".  Of course now we have the rest of the album to review...<br /><br />\\"Foreign Affairs\\" is pretty bland though.  Generic pop songs is NOT Mike Oldfield's forte.  At least anyone who's heard his classic stuff should understand this point of view.  Decent female vocals by Maggie Reilly, but certainly nothing that blows me away.  These vocals border on nursery rhyme-like and I'm pretty sure Oldfield's core audience isn't the children!  \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" is not related to Cat Stevens \\"Moonshadow\\" in case anyone is wondering (you're probably not!)  Pleasant, actually highly enjoyable new age folk-ish vocals.  You see it's the instrumental sections that make Mike Oldfield so wonderful.  This?  Well, it's just pleasant pop/rock.  Not fitting for Oldfield's style.<br /><br />\\"In High Places\\" features vocals by the legendary Yes man himself Jon Anderson.  I've never been a fan of his robotic vocals, but he's normally able to make up for that with a decent vocal melody from time to time.  There was actually a 6-album stretch from Time and a Word to Relayer when he was downright awesome in fact.  However 80's Yes is low on my list of favorite rock arists that made the transition from the 70's to the 80's, and a really bare and lackluster song like \\"In High Places\\" is the reason why.  If there's a melody here, it's really hard to make it out.<br /><br />WHAT THE?!?!  Roger Chapman of Family fame sings on \\"Shadow On the Wall!\\"  Alright, his presence alone makes up for any flaws the album may have had, haha.  Sorry, I'm a BIG Family fan and obviously very excited and surprised to hear him perform on a Mike Oldfield album!  By default I love this song the most. :)  No it doesn't *really* make up for the other less than stellar moments.  \\"Taurus 3\\" is a short acoustic instrumental that totally reminds me of picking flowers with Martha Stewart!  Not bad but of course, \\"Taurus II\\" eats this puppy alive.<br /><br />Overall, a decent album.  The flaws are few and far between, but they're noticeable from time to time.
0385535147|5.0|As John Grisham states in his Author's Notes, \\"[THE RACKETEER]is indeed a work of fiction.... Accuracy was not deemed crucial.  Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up facts.\\"  adding his fertile imagination to some ideas from others, he has written a gripping novel that maintains the reader's interest.<br />  A former Marine, Malcolm Bannister was found guilty of being part of a RICO (Racketeer Influlenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) offense.  His role was mininal and he claims he had no knowledge of what was happening.  The judge and jury saw it differently and he is now half-way through serving a ten-year term at a minimal security prison.  As a result of his incarceration, he has lost most of his family, especially his wife and son, his friends, and his law license.  At age 43, things look rather dismal.<br />  Then a federal judge is murdered.  The FBI has no lead to find the killer.  Malcolm has information to identify him and decides to trade that information for his own freedom.  The story tells how he handles that course and has many twists and turns.<br />  Grisham devotes a little space to the RICO Act.  He writes, \\"The Constitution names only three federal offenses:  treason, piracy, and counterfeiting.  Today there over forty five hundred federal crimes, and the number continues to grow as Congress gets tougher on crime and federal prosecutors become more creative in finding ways to apply all their new laws.\\"<br />  The story of this case is an excellent read.

0345803485|1.0|I had to attend a three day conference and forgot to pack my book. I overheard a few women at the conference  chuckling about the book during lunch and so I bought it later that day when I spied it in the bargain bin. After dinner, I curled up in my hotel bed and looked forward to reading such a highly touted erotic novel.<br /><br />I have never, ever read such poorly written drivel. Harlequins read  highbrow in comparison.  When not feeling overwhelmed with disgust that an author of such low talent could reach #1 on the NY Times Bestsellers list, I laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of the dialogue, the plot, the wooden, implausible characters and the general, horrible shittiness of the entire book.<br /><br />It is as if James once read 91/2 weeks and decided she would rip off the entire premise (stripped of all talent, nuance and interest) but tell the story via today's equivalent of a Valley Girl: Seattle Hipster Girl. \\"Laters,baby.\\" Double gag me with a spoon.<br />My inner goddess wants to give EL James's inner goddess a massive swirly, repeatedly.<br /><br />James  also honed in on the single sentence in the terrible, but enormously popular Twilight Series- and plucked out the single phrase that has/had every 13 year old and her \\"living vicariously through my kid\\" mother squirming in their collective estrogen and causing feminists to groan: \\"I feel very protective of you.\\" Ugh.<br /><br />The book has to be the single worst piece of crap I have ever forced myself to finish.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is such an amazing show! Be warned, you will lose countless hours of sleep, because its impossible to turn off!
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Mostly it's a very good adaptation of the graphic novel.<br /><br />I have several problems, and I won't consider them killers but have to note here;<br /><br />The acting is sometimes not as passionate as I'd like.  The dialogue is brushed over, especially the word \\"Rape\\"<br /><br />\\"Assault and mutilation of...\\"<br />\\"Only when they die by our hands... \\" but no \\"See their women Raped...\\"<br />No \\"And I will then take the city's new cop, it's WOMAN cop and I shall\\" - \\"The rest of the Mutant leader's speech was deemed unfit for broadcast\\"<br /><br />Now I won't say don't rent the movie, or to boycott it as some nerdy fanboy who's murdered they murdered his favorite childhood memory...<br />Just overall the adaptation is good but not perfect...<br /><br />I think they should have:<br /><br />1.  Made it dark and gritty.  There's an episode in the animated series \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\" where they did this effect perfectly and that was with I'd bet 1/10 the budget and no computer animation to help with the hard work.<br />2.  No apologies, let it be R rated have Miller's full dialogue...<br />3.  Anachron...what...?  Who cares, let it be Miller's original work of the Batman of the 50s to the 70s coming out of retirement in the 80s with Ray-Gun as prez and the world on the brink of nuclear war and Russians the big baddies in the background.  (the second or third Batman, the original universe started as an adult in the 30s)<br /><br />I think DC made some trade offs for a PG-13 rating and to skip over a dated work.  I'm still for watching it, buying it for most enthusiasts.  Good animation and very entertaining.<br />Some rabid purists might feel betrayed.  Not sure about that, like I would be over the new \\"Conan\\" that's a pointless re-make of the first movie.<br /><br />So 4 stars for something that finally gets turned into a movie, but a little short of what it could and should be.

0345803485|1.0|Best selling books are often a reflection of the society in which we live. Sadly,disturbingly this book and and the whole series both reflect and reinforce the sick,sexist,gender sterotyped,woman-hating pornographic male dominated society we all live in!<br /><br />As another Amazon.com reviewer points out in her review that in her first\\" spanking\\" Christian hits Ana 18 times in her own room and she's crying. Another reviewer said that he hits her so hard that he left marks on her body,but she lies to her friend and says she fell down the stairs,and the reviewer says in (Red Flag!). Another reviewer on Amazon.com UK who reviewed all 3 books,in this review of the last book,Fifty Shades Of Freed,she says that Christian hits her when she's pregnant and she says that this author has a lot to answer for and that her mind is a dark place and she never should have spewed it's contents with the world.She also said that she hopes she never writes another book,and that she needs help.He rapes her too!And Ana saying she's a virgin,and that he says to her I'm going to f*** you hard,(of course just like in the porn videos and Christian has a huge p**is too just like in the porn videos,which makes it even more painful and violent,and women in porn videos are portrayed as loving it too!) and she says he slams into her and rips out her virginity and she feels a pinching pain! How cruel and sadistic! In addtion to loving to beat her with his hands,chains,belts,slap,stalk her and sexually,physically and emotionally abuse her and her being portayed as a submissive masochist who loves this sexist,sick,sadistic,violent woman-hating man,and likes and is sexually turned on by to being brutalized by him.<br /><br />And sadly in the sexist,gender divided,gender stereotyped woman-hating,pornographic male dominated society we live in,many women are socialized to be masochists for men(and many men are socialized to be sadists from a young age),and from the time they are girls they see women and girls presented in ads,mainstream movies and pornography as nothing but sex objects and victims to be used and abused by men,and this is sexualized as it is in this pornographic book!<br /><br />I have read sexist woman-haters(including some women) say on message boards that the popularity of this book with women proves that women want to be sexually dominated and that this male dominance and female submission is natural and that women like to be used and abused. One woman-hater said,the Dice man was right,(he was referring to the once very popular woman-hating  comedian Andrew Dice Clay) treat women as the pigs that they are. And other men agreed with him. The book is also re-enforcing very common sexist gender myths,roles and gender stereotypes,many people are saying things about how \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine\\" are natural and in talking about this horrible damaging book.<br /><br /> There is *Nothing* \\"erotic\\" about men's sexual violence,domination and hatred of women! Only in a sick woman-hating pornographic patriarchy is it  twistedly considered so! It's so disturbing that very few people men and women even recognize this,and say things such as,like it's really surprising that women like sex,or like to read about  erotic literature, so they disturbingly define sex as men sexually using and abusing women,and the woman loving it,and male dominance and female submission.<br /><br />This isn't an erotic book that has an equal loving affectionate relationship between women and men(which is so rare in this society!) that just has graphic sex described.<br /><br />The next phase is going to be men killing women for their sexual pleasure and it will be presented as giving pleasure to women to be killed by men,and then people who object and protest will be called prudes.How totally crazy that this is what some women are saying is enhancing them sexually and what they are sharing with their family and friends?! How totally messed up and disturbing! And he also tells herwhen to eat,what to wear,etc,sleep, as I said beats her with whips, and canes,belts etc etc. It's so unreal that as another poster said in another topic about this terrible book on Hufington Post,that she finds it really disturbing that  many women are saying that reading a book about a man abusing a woman is what is improving their marriages and getting them to want to have sex with their husbands!<br /><br /> And this is insane woman-hatred,cruelty,violence towards women,sexualized,normalized,glamorized,and eroticized!No wonder many women are finding it \\"erotic\\" and \\"sexy\\"!<br /><br />In this novel just like in typical visual pornography,the sadistic,woman-hating,violent man's violence and brutalizing of the woman and the man's dominance and woman's submission,which is the eptiome of sexist gender inequality,is what is sexualized,normalized,eroticized,as the *SEX*!<br /><br /> Brilliant radical feminists like law professor Catherine Mackinnon's great important book of transcribed 1980's speaches ,Feminism Unmodified and acclaimed author John Stoltenberg's 1980's speaches  explain about this in his excellent important acclaimed book,Refusing To Be A Man:Essays On Sex And Justice,he's a pro-feminist man who co-founded Men Against Pornography in New York.<br /><br />And if someone wants to jump off a bridge and kill themselves it's OK because they consented to it right? And if this was a novel about a Black person who \\"willingly\\" \\"consents\\" to being sexually dominated and brutalized by a White man or a Jewish person for a Nazi,I'm sure that the media wouldn't have promoted it this way,and it wouldn't have been so popular with Blacks and Jews,there would be more outrage and not just by the Blacks and the Jews.And if was a novel about a woman sexually dominating and brutalizing a man,(not that this is healthy or right either)the media wouldn't have promoted it as normal and good,and it wouldn't be so popular with women either.<br /><br />Sadly women largely because oftypical visual pornography that has been unjustly mainstreamed for decades,and even more since it was unjustly put on the internet,which sexualizes,normalizes,and eroticizes male domination and female submission which is the epitome of sexist gender inequality,and men's irrational common hatred of women,and men's cruelity and violence just like this novel does,now believe this is what is \\"erotic\\" and \\"sexy\\" and women are still conditioned to identify as the passive submissive objects and victims for men.<br /><br />As far as it being written by a woman,as acclaimed radical feminist psychologist Phyllis Chesler said in her great 1994 book,Patriarchy Notes Of An Expert Witness, most wife beaters,child sex abusers and serial killers of women are addicted to pornography.And she also said that you can find such self-hating and woman-hating behaviors among women everywhere in churches,sororities and families,and she said proclaiming one self a \\"feminist\\" doesn't unfortunately inculcate one from sexist behaviors.<br /><br />In 1985 the FBI in Quantico Virgina did a personality profile on serial killers in the hope of catching them faster. I don't think they were thinking about pornography,but they found that 81% of them are obsessed and addicted to it!<br /><br />Fifty Shades would make a great handbook for rapists,wife beaters and serial killers because it reienforces the dangerous woman-hating myth that women love and deserve to be abused by men!<br /><br />Also,Christie Hefner ran Playboy for many years,and for over 40 years Playboy had tons of cartoons,some pictures,and articles prmoting,normalizing and making jokes about fathers and uncles sexually abusing their daughters and nieces,gang rapes of women and children,sexual murders of women and children including Santa Clause cartoons killing children,articles against women and feminism,and many cartoons of women sexually harassed by their bosses in the work place often on his desk etc,and here was a woman daughter ofa sexist woman-hating pornographer who was running it!<br /><br />The great brilliant feminist Gloria Steinem has always said and written that she's very against pornography,but not equal erotica or nudity,and she has written and spoken that she's against S&M even if it's \\"consensual\\" and the man is in the reverse \\"female\\" role of submissive object and victim!<br /><br />Here is quotes by Gloria on the excellent  informative*feminist* anti-pornography educational activist site,AntiPornography.org and they have a section on Fifty Shades Of Grey Harm and how it normalizes,sexualizes and glamorizes sexual,physical,and emotional abuse and is a form of domestic violence against women and the harms of S&M.<br /><br />Gloria said in 2006,\\"Pornography is a marketing device for sex trafficking:it normalizes degradation and violence as acceptable and even invitable parts of sex,and uses the bodies of real women and children as objects.The difference between pornography and erotica is clear in the roots of the words themselves-porne means female slaves,eros means love-so pornography like rape is about violence and domination not sex.Millions of lives depend on our ability to separate pornography from erotica and to disentangle violence from sexuality.\\"<br /><br />This is everything this horrible Fifty Shades of Sexist,Violent,Dangerous,Damaging,Woman-Hating sexualizes,normalizes and eroticizes!<br /><br />For about 15 years I have had Shere Hite's excellent book,The Hite Report On The Family:Growing Up Under The Patriarchy in which over 1000 girls and women and over 2000 boys and men from countries all over the world,mostly from the US and then Briton, answered question surveys about their experiences growing up in a sexit gender divided,gender stereotyped,woman-hating family and society,and the messages and training they got into \\"feminine\\" and \\"masculine\\" and she addressed how sadomasochism is about confusing \\"love\\" as power and control and aggression and submission and painand this goes back to childhood spankings and how in sadomasochistic pornography i'ts almost always the woman who experiences pain and domination of her body,and how it's a statement about the power relationship between men and women,and as she said sometimes an incitement to men to abuse women.<br /><br />She also mentions child abuse expert Alice Miller and a book,Spare The Child by Phillip Grevin about how childhood spankings get eroticized for adults and that sadomasochistic whippings and beatings by adults stems from this.<br /><br />You know it's also really something that for so many years these sicko pro-pornography people always denied what radical feminists so rightfully pointed out (and totally wrongly claimed they were just exaggerating,and were \\"anti-sex\\",)that there is a lot of men's violence and hatred of women, sexist gender inequality of male dominance and female submission in pornography and heterosexuality sexualized,and eroticized,and here is the further proof,in a huge best selling *pornographic* novel that just like typical visual pornography sexualizes,normalizes, and eroticizes all of these things!<br /><br />About 2 years ago I found an online Salon.com article from 2009 and I forget the title of it and I'd really like to find it again. It was by a woman who said she can tell when one of her male lovers is a pornography user because they have sex in a very detached,unaffectionate mechanical way. And she said her boyfriend was jack hammering away.In this article was a sex educator who contributes to I think an erotic site for women Babeland. And she said that men have been imitating pornography for years.And she said that in 2008 Babeland took a big poll of women and asked them what are the myths pornography teaches men about women and sex.<br /><br />They said,That women get org*sims from pen*tration,that women like to have semen on their faces,that an*l(s***hole!) sex is sexy and that women like very big p**ises. Isn't that something so messed up,that these are *EXACTLY* the damaging lies,myths and distortions that E.L James writes,promotes,normalizes,and reinforces in her horrible sexist,woman-hating,sexualizing,& eroticizing men's violence against women books! I have a feeling that E.L James's husband is or was a big pornography user & then she watched it with him,which research shows is usually because of a male partner,and then she wrote her books from what she saw,and was taught to her as \\"normal\\" and \\"sexy\\". And or she was sexually and physically abused either as a child or as an adult.<br /><br />This all just so terrible and maddeing! What is widely being considered erotic and sexy and women's sexuality and women expressing it as a good thing,is women following the typical sexist,woman-hating,male violence against women,sexist gender inequality of male dominance and female submission that typical male dominated sexist woman-hating pornography teaches,sexualizes,normalizes and eroticizes! So sex is men's cruelty,violence,dominance,and hatred of women!<br /><br />Home<br />Photo Gallery<br />Members<br />Blog<br />Links<br />Contact Us<br />Forums<br />Videos<br /><br />50 Shades is Domestic Abuse<br /><br />Welcome<br />This website has been set up to campaign against the \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" book series.  These books have been portrayed as a erotic fiction and have gained total acceptability throughout popular culture.  As campaigners, workers, women who have experienced domestic abuse and preventers of violence against women, we stand up to say these books are not erotic fiction, but the full reality of domestic abuse.  Putting the series as erotic fiction gives it credibility that it does not deserve.  These books portray sexual, emotional, physical and psychological violence and abuse as not only normal, but as something to aspire to.  As people committed to the eradication of violence against women we reject the normalising of abuse these books are perpetuating and we call you to join us.<br /><br />Join us in fighting back!<br /><br />You can download a book cover here which you can print and place in the shops where you find them.  Please take pictures/videos of books you have covered and post them on twitter and/or facebook and email them to us and we will upload them to our website photo album.<br /><br />We can make a difference and see these books publically becoming unacceptable to read!

B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Game freezes.. accepted a $4.99 coin purchase from me then never worked again.  Only really played it for 10 minutes and never worked again.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I only first watched this program for the first time last December. I was impressed enough to watch a few more episodes and now to watch a whole season of Big Bang Theory.<br /><br />Sheldon, Raj, Leonard, Howard and Penny's relationship continues to evolve in the series, with Sheldon assuming a \\"virtual presence,\\" Howard proposing to Bernadette, Leonard begins a relationship with Raj's sister and Penny realizes that she has lost out on a good thing.<br /><br />The writing for this program is great and the actors do some wonderful characters. I look forward to watching more of these soon!
B009FB3XTA|3.0|before you buy, especially \\" Let's be honest here\\". It's boring and whiny.  I still love all the other soundtracks and have them on my Ipod; not this one because I would fall off the treadmill in a deep sleep. :-) Where is Muse when you need them?<br />Or Perry Farrel or Beck and bat for lashes?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't stop reading!!!! It was incredible! I Had to pick up the next book immediately, you never know what's next!
B0090YHSFC|1.0|can't play while off line because developer is too paranoid about people using the app without giving him his dollar so it checks amazon EVERY LOAD so if you are somewhere without a network then you're screwed
0525951652|5.0|Fall of Giants is an exceptional read, mixing real history with fictional characters in a way that brings significant insight into the politics and social realities of a wide variety of political movements, not least of which are Social Democrats, Conservatives, Nazis, Bolsheviks and much more heading into WWI. Excellent!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Classic, awesome.  Corporate, mental, social &#34;chains&#34; -- you are more than you think ou are.<br /><br />But someone told me this was a love story.  I still can't see that.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I purchased BLS and TSC on the advice of a friend and was really surprised on how the formulas and training routines are simple.  I have had some leg problems and have not started the program yet, but now that my physical therapy is going well, I plan to start after Thanksgiving.  I have downloaded the JEFIT app for my phone and created the exercises as Mike recommends.  I am looking to have my meal plan ready for a quick review by Mike and looking forward to my start.  I have never been one to in the gym or workout, but I am looking forward to this workout as it is very simple and I do not have to devote a lot of time while in the gym.  Take look at these books and you will be surprised.  Good Luck!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is well worth purchasing,stunning cast and an imaginative approach to the subject of aging and life options for those willing to take a risk. Such an experienced cast and their sensitive portayal of each character and their respective challenges, could not fail to impress and provide much food for thought.
0525952926|5.0|I found Winter of the World incredibly engaging. Follett has woven history and fiction together in a beautiful way, giving us insights into beliefs and concerns of citizens trapped in the political realities of Europe, North America, Russia, China and Japan. It's riveting reading and I highly recommend it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is amazing it contains all of my favorite things buliding managing also it uses real time so I earn money while I sleep that is just cool
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|A good buy for any one who jams. Great for when I practice after hours. Also depends on the quality of the headphones.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Yes, the plot is less than stellar. The acting is ok but the men are FABULOUS! Matt Bomer & Joe Manganiello needed much more screen time. Channing & Alex did a fine job with their alotment though.<br /><br />A must see- again :)
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Reasonably priced effective microphone.  Perfect for the beginner who wants a quick, simple and effective way to get started.  I used an adapter and connected it to my iphone no problem.  The battery can be a little tricky to insert, but take your time and it will go.
B007TK77QE|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever  read.  Ms Rowlings should stick to Harry Potter books.  Why is it necessary to use the F word in any  form when writing, Movies etc. It turns a good story into a trash novel or movie.<br />Do you use the F word in every day conversation to your family members. I know I don't and do not see why it is necessary  in any  writings.<br />I gave it NO STARS. It was just TRASH.
B00846TTDG|5.0|For what others do for you that you never get to hear about, very enjoyable and worthy of the rental
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out. My children turned me on to Tim Burton and Beattlejuice  when they were young teens. I bought it recently and think it's even better now. Would recommend it to any age group'
B0026P3G12|4.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  The purchase was as expected and a great value.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This was heaven sent. I needed more room for my photo equipment. I decided a backpack would be the way to go. When I saw the prices of them, I was about to rethink it. Then I saw this one. It's as good as any, at a price anyone who needs a backpack can afford.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game but had to uninstall when it started crashing. fix it and it is awesome!!! so much fun
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Cute fun game with good graphics. Not a timed game which I hate so that is alright for me. Cute little penguins sliding around on different shaped icebergs. You need to cut the ice to fill the drink glass while keeping the penguins together. Different levels have different obstacles added to make it more difficult. Kind of addictive so watch out...LOL All and all a good game to pass the time.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This was a great value and the movie is one you will want to watch over and over.  This was a gift item.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|This was a very good book and wrote very well had a hard time putting it down. Very sad to know that someone could do this to a little girl.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Ridley Scott is a genious! This is a great film. Beautiful cinematography, thrilling action, and a great cast of characters! If you enjoyed the alien franchise, then you will love how uncomfortable and eery this film is ;)
B004KKXMSI|2.0|One of the disks (the movie Jurassic Park) was defective. It froze in the T-Rex scenes. The other two disks were fine. I enjoyed the better definition of Blu-ray.<br />Now I have to buy Jurassic Park again because sending the product back to Amazon is almost as expensive as buying a new movie.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|I enjoyed this book to the fullest Mr. Gaiman, I am sure, would be a very interesting to sit down with. Well worth the time, an easy and very enjoyable read.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is perfect for me. I love listening to radio from all over the world and also finding just about any type of music you could ever want.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's John Grisham.  It twists and it turns.  You can expect a great ride.  Don't overthink it and and don't try to figure it out yourself.  He'll satisfy you soon enough. Just jump on, relax and revel in how well he does what he does.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love whole album, but Demons steal the show. It seems I need a few more word for this review so - Awesome :)
B009329Y30|4.0|As a Hugh fan of Nicholas Sparks' books, I wait for the movies with anticipation. The Lucky One is not only a romance story, there is a genuine look at human relationships and how they shape our our personal beings,our daily interactions, and our responses. They did a good job with this movie.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have read every book written by Patricia Cornwell. I am so excited to start reading when one of her books comes out but the last few have been so disappointing in the direction she has taken us with Lucy, Marino, and Benton. Loved the earlier books - the latest ones not so much!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love everything about this app.  The hourly view is nice to look ahead at the temps overnight.  You'll love it!
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I have been listening to aerosmith since the beginning. For me they are a true classic rock band. They have tried many different styles as a band.<br />When they play rock they are awesome. At this point unfortunatly they make commericial music which means play what ever sells cds.<br />The album start with some good rockers then goes to some hybrid styles then to ballads and by the end runs out of gas.<br />I like the album for the about 4 songs. I agree with the other review, the mixing is really mudding and not very clear.<br />I do believe aerosmith is cable of a really rockin album this just ain't it.<br /><br />Time may not be on there side anymore......major
B008D28HYS|5.0|If I could I would give it a 10 star rating.  I absolutely love this game. If you like logic puzzles you will love this. I haven't had any force closes.  I play on my Kindle Fire, but I also have it on my phone and play at work when I am on lunch.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|This was the best concert that I had ever been to! I recieved the blu ray early from their main site along with the lithograph and I was more than excited to see the disc.It is not just a concert but also a documentary.It is very well arrange as the intermissions are played in between every 3 songs or so.The band talks about their experience with this tour and what they wanted to deliver to the audience.The concert and the intermissions are beautiful.It hits an emotional spot and reminds me why I was sad when there concert ended when I saw them in Dallas.I love the wrist band idea.It really does make the audience feel as if they are a part of the show and giving their own contribution to it.I find Coldplay to be very inspirational and I do hope that they will continue forever, if that were possible.This band has made a big impact on me and has a special place in my life.Be rebellious and get your spray cans everyone!
B003P2WJ6S|4.0|This book was an interesting read even for the non scientific crowd.  I would recommend this book as a heartfelt story that holds the readers attention from many different angles
B002RI9HUM|5.0|What can I say, I have a paperback copy of this book that is getting so tattered, so I invested in an electronic Kindle version. I have read this book at least 5 times, every time I read it I end up with tears of laughter running down my face. If I ever feel down I know I can open this book and it will lift my spirits once more. The character of Rachael is fantastic. Drugs addiction is such a dreadful disease and yet it was so wonderful to see how she came from total denial to realising she was indeed an addict. The journey we took with her was not morbid and depressing, it was funny and so uplifting when she finally got her act together. Marian Keyes has the knack of making all the characters in her books real and three dimentional. Love her books and am always waiting with baited breath for her next one.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Terrible attempt at a Minecraft copy.<br />The demo doesn't work corrrectly on the Fire and I expect the full version is likely the same way.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|How can this new app from Amazon not be compatible with the Kindle Fire HD??? Does not work with my android phone either (Samsung Infuse).
0783229526|4.0|Johnny Depp is excellent and the film is very entertaining. It is crazy and that is what makes it so good. If you enjoy pleasantly entertaining druggies, you will like this film.
B0090YHSFC|1.0|i am telling u guys with kindle fires now do not get this game. there is a lot of glishes
B002SQ364Q|5.0|This movie was way groovy, man. I mean, I just... dude. It was so real, so raw, so rockin'. I would recommend this to like, the man, man. Peace, love and rock'n'roll, dude!
B00973DDN2|5.0|this was a fantastic album and I strongly recommend it to any killers fan out there. When you buy this album you to can be battle born!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you are into games of all kinds you'd love 101 Games.<br />The app is fun for kids of all ages if you know how to move your fingers!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Like it.  Easy to play. Almost like an old version of Sim city. I recommend it for a simple game play.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I bought the movie at a great price and it was still in the packaging! I can definitely say that this was a wonderful movie!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Dolphin is a great Browser. I love the way you find web pages with a gesture. The battery saver that you can get with it is the best I have found for a smart phone.
B001WCBPCW|5.0|I got the CD way faster than expected, because it came before the date given! This is a great album can't stop listening to it!
B004H83IM8|5.0|The kids had been asking for this movie for a while, so I got it for them.  They loved it!  And watch it often!
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|It's hard to describe Del Rey's music. It's a fairy-dusting of harp laid over top a hip-hop cadence. It's lush instrumentals alongside precise vocal transitions from low and jazzy up to high and girlish. Del Rey has called her own music \\"Hawaiian glam metal.\\" Others have called it \\"Hollywood sadcore.\\"<br /><br />Others have described it in less complimentary ways. One reviewer called it a thin bundle of Lolita imprecations and sun-baked poolside sexuality. Another called it the epitome of a faked orgasm.<br /><br />Del Rey's music neither soothes nor satiates, but it captivates. One reviewer nailed it: \\"These are the disturbing movies that you watch because of the intensity behind the storytelling.\\"<br /><br />That's why I think the most accurate description of this music is \\"Lynchian,\\" as in the filmmaker David Lynch. On this EP she performs a deadened rendition of a song from his movie Blue Velvet. In the hands of Del Rey, it's even more Lynchian: twisted and disturbing, the drugged sexuality of a mannequin come halfway to life.<br /><br />Del Rey, like Lynch, is \\"the perfect mirror of our time\\" and \\"the artist we deserved.\\" She neither soothes nor satiates, but she certainly warrants our attention.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you liked Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, Bottle Rocket, The Life Aquatic, and The Darjeeling Limited, then you'll love this movie.  Wes Anderson has a way of taking you into the quirky worlds of his characters.  The plot involves two young people, who decide to run away together, and form their own society.  The rest of the movie involves the parents and other interested parties trying to find them.  The actors who play the young boy and girl, are relative unknowns, but they give great performances for first timers.  Also, strong performances by Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray(always great), and Bruce Willis make this a must see for Wes Anderson fans.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Another top series that should be on a major network but can't be because of its content.  Watched every episode and look forward to each season.
B0024F08RO|5.0|Purchased this DVD set as a gift for my son. He absolutely loved this series and enjoyed adding this 'set' to his library.  The set is of good quality and was well written.  Definitely would purchase this again.  Wish the program was still airing.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. So much more details than the movie. Addicting after you start reading it. A must have.
B007XNAQL0|3.0|Let me start by saying this is a fantastic concert. Very imaginative in its staging and execution, and visually deserves 4 or 5 stars, not the 3 that I gave it. HOWEVER, having owned the dvd since its original release several years ago I was disappointed in how, with the new audio mix, they went for a more &#34;lush&#34; sound that, I feel, sucks all the energy out of the performance. With the old dvd version, the DTS audio gives the bass and drums a &#34;presence&#34; they just don't have in the new mix. Also, even though I had been upset over the exclusion of &#34;Red Rain&#34; from the original release, I now see why they cut it - it's lifeless.<br />The blu-ray, while the footage looks better, was a big let-down. Amazing that you could get so very different impressions from the same concert.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Too difficult.  The angry birds is much better. Levels are top difficult, it isn't the same fun as angry birds.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Well written movie.  Great for watching at home or on a plane trip.  A movie worth watching over and over.  Love it!
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I loved this book and I would recommend  it to everyone  who loves diary of a simply kid I have all the books by Jeff Kinney  I would love to read the next one coming up.
B00122MWBK|5.0|All the favorites, I've been listening to it over and over since I purchased it. I saw them perform this summer, it was a great show.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was great! I waited for it to be released. Good sequel to bared. It was a good choice if you read fifty shades and needed something new! Can't wait for the next book! Leaves you wanting more.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|Easy to follow so much to remember. Hopefully some of it will have sunk in. I now know a little more about what I am supposed to be doing thanks to this publication. Thoroughly recommended read for anyone trying to get to grips with the art of photography.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|This game is suckish-it should be either free or 99cents or $1.99.and it frenquently losses memmory ant tons of times the game is down.DONT BE A FOOL DONT BUY THIS GAME.im not a hater i love spiderman,the movie the books the games but this is nothing but a ripoff.
B002RVEIAI|5.0|Really you got to ask. Bah bah is this fifteen words yet? Nope bah bah three two one and done.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Really liked this movie. Kenneth B directing gave it almost a Shakespeare temperature. The special effects were great  but the development of the relationships of the people was terrific. Chris Hemsworth is a beautiful &#34;bod&#34; but so much more. Love his voice and he's a good actor. There's something that coemes from him as a person. Feel like you could discuss politics or feelings with him. Life on the outback and his parents definitely centered both him and Liam.His wife's a lukcy woman.<br />Casting was perfect. Loved all of them but Loki is my favorite -  a tough role to project an increasingly bad guy image but still be at least a little likeable.
B004VB3V0K|4.0|There are a few really good haskell books.  This is my favorite.  Metaphors for complicated categorical objects are kept light and limited.  They are seldom stretched to their breaking point.<br /><br />I wish there were more coverage of topics like Arrows which are becoming more common in the Haskell programming community.<br />Also, more &#34;cookbook&#34; would be nice... But &#34;Real World Haskell&#34; works well to fill this gap.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This program runs smoothly and is fun to play.  I like the options the game offers.  I highly recommend this program.
1439110123|5.0|THE PRIZE by Daniel Yergin is an 884 page history book about the oil industry.  High points include the discoveries of oil in Pennsylvania, Texas, Baku, Sumatra, Iran, and in off-shore locations.  (Baku was an independent duchy that was taken by Russia in 1813, by way of the Treaty of Gulistan.  But now, Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan.)  High points of this book also include info on collaborations between companies, e.g., Standard Oil of California, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Texaco, Socony, Gulf, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (see page 503).  The book avoids chemistry, and avoid disclosing innovations relating to the detection, drilling, and refinement of oil.  The book is mainly about politics.  For me, the most exciting part of the book was about oil supplies for the Allies and Axis countries during WWII.  For example, we read that U.S. General Carl Spaatz, under Eisenhower, led an attack on May 12, 1944 of 935 bombers against Germany's I.G.Farben synthetic oil factory in Leuna, Germany (page 346), and on May 28th attacked Germany's oil facilities located  in Rumania.  The book is essential reading for anyone interested in WWII, in the Middle East, or in how the world is put together.  The book is abundantly readable, and can be understood in its entirety by any intelligent high school student.  Difficult words rarely occur, and they make their appearance on only a dozen or so pages in the entire book.  For example, we find imbroglio (page 477), condottiere (page 501), disquisition (page 521), nostrum (page 570), and hegemony (page 638).  That's about it for the difficult words in this book!<br /><br />PHOTOGRAPHS.  The book contains 32 pages of glossy B & W photos showing, e.g., an oil well in Pennsylvania (1859), an oil field of 15 oil wells in Pennsylvania (1865), George Bissell, John Galey, Spindletop oil well (1901), Marcus Samuel, oil well in Sumatra (1885), Calouste Gulbankian, King Ibn Saud, Germany's synthetic fuels plant before and after being bombed, Mossadegh, George McGhee, etc.  The following (below) outlines some of the highlights of this book.<br /><br />JAPAN IN WWII.  In entering WWII, Japan believed that it had enough oil to last for two years, and that afterwards it could get oil form the East Indies (Borneo, Balikpapan in Borneo, Sumatra).  In fact, the Japanese were able to capture enough East Indies territory to provide 50 million barrels/year, sufficient for the Japanese fleet.  Japan discovered a huge oil field in Sumatra, called THE MINAS STRUCTURE.  However, a problem was that Japan did not bother to provide convoys to protect their oil tankers.  Eventually, Japan provided convoys, but the US used the radio signals from the convoys as homing devices.  US submarines, by early 1945, cut off 100% of Japan's oil supply.  In desperation, Japan tried using tug boats pulling rubber bags filled with oil, but the oil dissolved the rubber.  Also, Japan decided to build coal-burning ships, but these sailed slowly.  Also, Japan turned to pine roots, which were dug up and distilled in thousands of small stills, producing 75,00 barrels of oil/month (pages 73-75, 318, 350-364).<br /><br />RED LINE AGREEMENT.  This concerns Mesopotamia and interest by Anglo-Persian Oil Co., and by Turkish Petroleum Co.  Turkish Petroleum Co. was assembled by CALOUSE GULBENKIAN, son of a wealthy Armenian who imported Russian kerosene into Turkey.  In 1917-1918, that is, at the close of WWI, England realized that it would need oil for any future wars, and thus decided to invest in Mesopotamia and Persia.  Three groups, (1) Anglo-Persian, (2) Royal Dutch, and (3) American companies, in 1925 sent expedition to Iraq, and on October 15, 1927 at BABA GURGUR discovered a huge source of oil (page 204).  A contract was then signed, giving Royal Dutch/Shell (24%), Anglo-Persian (24%), French (24%), Near Eastern Development Co. (24%), and Calouse Gulbenkian (5%) the indicated percentages.  Thecontract included a map with a red line circling Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Iraq (but not circling Persia or Kuwait) (page 204-205).  The RED LINE AGREEMENT provided that participants in the Iraq Petroleum Co. (IPC) could not operate independently within the red boundaries.  They were required to act in unison or not at all (page 282).  After WWII, American companies (Jersey and Socony) argued that the RED LINE AGREEMENT was no longer valid, but France and Mr. Gulbenkian argued that it was still valid (pages 413-414).  France needed the RED LINE AGREEMENT to be intact, because without it, France would have no access to middle eastern oil.  Gulbenkian wanted it to remain intact, because IPC and its predecessor (Turkish Petroleum Co.) was his life's work.  The book then details the formation of ARAMCO, a company that was totally American, with the concurrent dissolution of the RED LINE AGREEMENT (page 419).  The book discloses the plan of STANDARD OIL OF NEW JERSEY and SACONY to merge with STANDARD OIL OF CALIFORNIA and TEXACO, in order to form ARAMCO.  This merger agreement was signed on March 12, 1947.  Aramco means, \\"Arabian-American Oil Co.\\"  Initially, Aramco was only Standard Oil of California and Texaco (p. 410), but later it consisted of the above four companies.  The book highlights one aspect of the Aramco merger, namely, the opinion of KING IBN SAUD.  King Saud was interested in only one thing, namely, assurance that none of these four companies was controlled by the British.  In particular, he was worried about Jersey and Sacony being controlled by the British.  But as it was, Aramco was 100% American.<br /><br />CRITICISM.  A failure of this book is that it does not explain the practical consequences of dissolving the RED LINE AGREEMENT, and the expansion of Aramco into four companies.  In other words, the reader is not told if Gulbenkian's access to particular oil fields, or if his fees and profits were changed.  Also, we are not told if Aramco'saccess to particular oil fields, or if its fees or profits were changed by dissolving the RED LINE AGREEMENT.  Please note the following general criticism of this book.  If you ask a person who was \\"really there,\\" and who experienced first hand the events in history that are disclosed in this book, it is possible that you will learn that some of the narratives in THE PRIZE are not accurate.  But type of shortcoming typical of many newspaper reports, and it might also be expected to result in a book that is based on newspaper reports. It is thus the case, that THE PRIZE is mainly trustable as starting point -- good for initial orientation --  should one be possessed to embark on a career relating to the oil industry.<br /><br />SPINDLETOP.  Patillo Higgins, a 1-armed mechanic and lumber merchant, noticed gas bubbling through springs at a hill called SPINDLETOP, near Beaumont, Texas.  In 1892, he organized Gladys City Oil Co., but geologists investigating the area called it nonsense.  Higgins found a partner (Anthony Lucas), and Lucas went to Pittsburgh, PA to attract the interest of wildcatters (John Galey and James Guffey).  Galey was a geologist.  Guffey was a politician and promoter who dressed as Buffalo Bill.  On January 10, 1901, Higgins' team struck oil at 880 feet deep, and oil flowed at 75,000 barrels per day.  Land that previously sold for $10/acre now went for $900,000/acre (page 85).  The result  of SPINDLETOP was that the focus of America's oil production moved from Pennsylvania to Texas and Oklahoma.  Shell Oil. Co, located in London, and run by MARCUS SAMUEL, took an interest and signed a 20-year contract with Guffey for marketing oil from SPINDLETOP.<br /><br />REZA PAHLAVI  and MOSSADEGH.  At the halfway point in this book we find an account of goings-on in Iran.  This part of the book is fairly dense, and so provide the status of things by way of these bullet points:<br />(1) Reza Pahlavi (the father) (1878-1944) was pro-Germany.  He died in exilein South Africa.<br />(2) Reza's son, also Reza Pahlavi (1919-1980) became king at age 21.<br />(3) Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Kashani hates all foreigners, and hates the fact that Reza allowed women to not wear veils.<br />(4) Bribery is the rule among all politicians in Iran.<br />(5) In Iran, it was almost universal to hate foreigners, especially the British.<br />(6) Elevated hatred was directed against Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., a British company.<br />(7) United States, represented by George McGhee, Asst. Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, was afraid of Soviet's taking control of Iran, and in order to fend off the Communists, the US told Anglo-Iranian Oil. Co. to increase royalties to Iran.  The result was a hike in royalties in the year 1949, paid by Anglo-Iranian to Iran.<br />(8) US urged British government to pressure Anglo-Iranian to make Iran a bigger offer.  But William Fraser (1888-1970), head of Anglo-Iranian (later named British Petroleum), had from experience realized that Iranian attitude was one of \\"ingratitude, deception, backbiting, and new demands.\\"  (page 420).<br />(9) Fraser was aware that other oil producing companies were winning 50/50 agreements, and at that point (autumn 1950), decided to give more money to Iran.<br />(10) Mossadegh became prime minister of Iran in April 1951, and nationalized Iran's oil, and declared that Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. to be abolished.<br />(11) Britain made plans to attack Iran, but to limit its attack to the capture of ABADAN island.  The US was against this, since this might inspire the Soviets to attack Iran from the north.<br />(12) But Britain countered that if it did not attack, all middle eastern countries would begin to nationalize the work-product of foreign investments, e.g., Suez Canal (pae 458).<br />(13) In July 1951, AVERELL HARRIMEN arrived in Tehran to act as a broker.  Harrimen stayed in a mirrored room in Shah's palace.  Harrimen tried to make Mossadegh understand the expenses entailed by Anglo-Iranian in marketing the oil, e.g., expenses for wharves, storage tanks, pumps, roads, rail tanks, and a fleet of tankers (page 462).  But Mossadegh refused to allow Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. to resume business in Iran.<br />(14) On Sept. 25, 1951, every last British employee of Anglo-Iranian escaped from Iran.<br />(15) The British set up an oil embargo, preventing all Iranian oil exports, and within a few weeks, Iranian oil production dropped from 666,000 barrels/day to only 20,000 barrels/day.<br />(16) George McGhee tried to persuade Mossadegh to allow ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL (not a British company) to operate what was formerly Anglo-Iranian (page 466).<br />(17) At this point in time (1943), rule under Mossadegh involved murder, chaos, and poverty.<br />(18) On August 18, 1953, Reza Pahlavi ordered Mossadegh out of power (details on this accomplishment not explained by this book), and Reza Pahlavi became extremely popular in Iran (for reasons not explained by this book).<br />(19) On October 29, 1954, Reza Pahlavi agreed to let a consortium operate in Iran (page 476).  This consortium consisted of *Anglo-Iranian, *Standard Oil of New Jersey, * Socony, * Texaco, *Standard Oil of California, *Gulf, *Shell, and *CFP (a French company).

B007V5CF5K|5.0|While this program is a little more difficult than other programs of this type, I enjoyed the challenge.  The story line runs smoothly.

1616960922|5.0|Love the conservation of detail, and love the many nods to Elantris.  Great world building, as always.<br /><br />Also find myself liking that there are so few action scenes (Contrast: Mistborn.  But that book may as well star Jackie Chan).
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A different approach with historical information not seen before,and a good lesson on how opposites can work together to accomplish what is good for both sides.
B001HN6922|5.0|Nice deal on a second go around for this movie! My grandson wore out the his first Cars 2 DVD and I didn't want to pay full price to replace it. I received it in great condition and he watches it several times a week. Very happy with this purchase!
B008133DO8|5.0|The design and filming of Sherlock is inventive and engaging. Benedict Cumberbatch's acting (as well as Steven Mofatt) is amazing -- he is the epitome of modern-day Sherlock Holmes. Loved the use of technology in this series! I actually started to appreciate London while watching the show (I visited the city a few years ago, wasn't impressed).

B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I'm loving the game but here's the rub...other reviews state they paid 2.99 to unlock the game. I just had to pay 4.99. what's the deal G5?
B0072440OE|5.0|A very haunting examination of unfaithfulness...definitely a story we've all heard before.  However, Jones's honesty combined with Burton's excellent arrangements is what makes this one stand out from all the rest.  The album is a bit different from her previous work (i.e., adult contemporary piano/vocals) but you will not be displeased; that is unless you are the person she is talking about on this album.  It will be difficult for Jones to top this one, but hopefully her collaboration with Burton will continue.<br /><br />I would advise getting the vinyl version, which also comes with a digital download.  The album has that sound which, although good on CD, is best brought out by a record player.
0307277887|5.0|Dexter is a serial killer with a certain kind of lycanthropy. Every full moon, he must sate an urge to slaughter someone. But unlike your run-of-the-mill thrill-seeking psychopath, Dexter carefully adheres to a code - only the scum of society, those who kill without remorse and are beyond redemption or rehabilitation become his targets.<br /><br />That being said, I must mention that I saw the first season of the TV series prior to reading the novel. As such, I was slightly disappointed by the brevity of the content. It was, essentially, about Dexter himself, and one moon's revolution in his life. Other characters are given brief descriptions and glimpses into their pasts, but this is more than sufficient to generate interest and understand their motivations. They will no doubt be fleshed out further in this series. There's LaGuerta, the conniving inspector who rose through the police ranks with assets other than elbow grease, Sergeant Doakes, an African American officer who sees Dexter for what he is (apparently, one of very few who actually can pull off such an incredible feat). Vince Masuoka is my personal favourite, as the foul-mouthed forensics analyst who works alongside Dexter and his blood spatter deductions.<br /><br />Dexter's foster father, Harry, and his stepsister Deborah are given more character development commensurate with their importance in Dexter's life, and while Dexter cannot feel love or affection (keeping pets always ended in tragedy), he does thoroughly understand familial obligations.<br /><br />The politics of the police system is given a hard, cold, cynical look. The vivid watercolors that Lindsay uses to paint the scenes and dirty behind-the-scenes goings-on will elicit more than a few chuckles, several disappointed head-droops, and countless facepalms.<br /><br />Dexter's lucid dreams and slides into insanity are written with a realism that few can match. Tension is retained until close to the climax, which is monumentally shocking. Though it can be spotted a few dozen pages away, the impact will remain with you just as it has with Dexter.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I loved it. The layers of story just keep going deeper, the characters more complex, and the show just keeps getting better.

Another thing I love is it has the % percent sign so because I can check my discounts to see if the sale is even worth it Black Friday is coming and it comes in very handy.

B0085RQLXK|2.0|I love Aerosmith, let me make that clear.  I am happy that they have released this new cd because I would rather have a poor cd to listen to occassionally than nothing from the band, and yes I personally find this to be a poor cd.  Unlike other reviewers I do not expect them to \\"go back\\" to their \\"Rocks\\" days, just as I do not expect the Stones to release a new \\"Exile,\\" but I remember a time where after a string of no or mediocre cd's they released \\"Pump\\" and got something new and vibrant on the market.  Alas, this does not fall into that category.  They are still immersed in the type of music they have released on their last two albums worth of new music (Just Push Play and Get a Grip) both of which I no longer own (I stream a lot of my music now from a service).  I will not be purchasing this cd, and I will listen to it occassionally where it will eventually be relegated to the bargain basement of my non collection.<br />  As a whole, for them this is just too \\"plain.\\"  Even with familiarity with the cd's I mention, there is not much here that pops.  There are good songs, good vocals, good playing, but after listening to it throughout the week it comes out as a \\"vanilla\\" listen.  Good and tasty, but sub par as a whole.  Ultimate fans will want this for their collection, but others can skip this and not miss much in my humble opinion (and if it differs than yours, just remember...it is my opinion, it does not make me right, but it is how I feel).  Hopefully this will be the stepping stone that Permanent Vacation was for Pump!  Regardless about how I feel about this cd (and I do not hate it), I hope they produce more new music!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My almost eight-year-old daughter loves the Disney Fairies movies and we have all of the DVDs including this latest title. \\"Secret of the Wings\\" is our favorite of the series (followed by the first, third, and finally the second in the series) so far. It is a beautiful movie bringing to vivid life the world of the warm fairies and the winter fairies. The storyline is the best in the series so far, in my humble opinion. Tinker Bell makes a startling discovery in this story - she has a sister named Periwinkle. Trouble is, Periwinkle is a winter/frost fairy and the siblings can never be together because they come from different worlds and will face difficulties in each other's world.<br /><br />I loved the creative twists in the plot as Tinker tries her best to find a way to spend time with her newly-found sister. Tinker gets plenty of help from her ever sympathetic friends such as Rosetta, Iridessa, Silver Mist, and even fast-flying fairy Vidia, who used to be so mean to Tinker in the past. The theme of sisterly love, the strong bonds of family and friendship, and self-sacrifice is beautifully woven into the plot, making this an engaging watch for both young and old alike. I usually watch the movies with my daughter and found myself particularly captivated by this story. The sneak peek on the DVD indicates there's another Tinker movie coming next year and we wait in anticipation. Meanwhile, this DVD is going to get plenty of repeat viewings by my little one!
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I'm about halfway through watching Boardwalk Empire on my Kindle.  Great show - scads of characters and storylines I'm interested in and what a setting.  Can't wait to see Margaret develop more!  I love all the Atlantic City sets and there are some fabulous interiors, too. This is a show that it's extremely easy for my 17 year old daughter and I to enjoy together.
B0034G4P80|5.0|What can I say but Oh MY.  Chris Hemsworth is so gorgeous.  Just to watch him is worth the movie.  The movie is action packed and has a good plot and theme.  Lots of adventure and excitement.  Great color but sometimes to dark.  All in all a good movie.

B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love this show! I've been watching it since season one and so I was excited for this season as well. I missed an episode but thankfully it was on Amazon and allowed me to catch up. So far this season has been crazy and we're not even near the end yet.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved this book.  I just stumbled upon it while trying to find something to read on the Kindle.  I was thrilled from the very beginning because it is very, very funny and entertaining.  Things keep happening that you don't expect and the ending is very clever.  I highly recommend it!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Great game for short gaming sessions.  Not at the mercy of bad physics, only your own abilities.  Doesn't test your patience with difficult &quot;3 star&quot; situations.  If looking for extreme difficulty, this isn't your game.
1442419814|4.0|So I'd seen this book around for ages and decided to pick it up on one of my book-buying shopping sprees, and I'm glad I did.  It ended up being better than I expected.<br /><br />Uglies is about a girl who is set to have surgery to become 'pretty' which is what all the Uglies with to be.  They dream about the day they become 'Pretty' and Talia is no exception.  Things go awry for Talia when she meets Shay, a girl who was willing to do anything, but become pretty.  She runs away leaving Talia to deal with 'Special Circumstances' which is the equivalent for the law in this dystopian world.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that the pace of the story was all that quick, in fact, in some ways it was kind of dull, but when it did speed up, it became quite a good book.  I liked the world Scott Westerfeld made, but at the same time I hated it.  The people in this world forgot that personality counted for something, and they had real self-image problems.<br /><br />Talia was like this as well at the start.  What I liked was that I saw her grow from someone who had issues with a way a person looked, including herself, to someone who had a sense of self-worth.  She was incredibly brave, but at the same time incredibly stupid.  And there was no denying that at the end, she was incredibly loyal.  I liked her.  I had to wonder about her parents though. Kids in this world left their parent when they were around twelve.  I had to wonder what kind of relationship she had had with her parents beforehand.  There was no back story.<br /><br />David was adorable.  He was the kind of person who befriended everyone.  Despite the dangerous life he led, he trusted people.  But, I don't think it was a mindless trust.  He had been raised to survive. And, his faith in people was hard to shake.  He accepted a lot of thing, like people leaving 'the Smoke' to become Pretty.  I guess he had a sense of naivete about him.  I like that he grew up with his family and I got to know a bit about them.<br /><br/>And I have to mention Shay, because she was the one who started Talia's adventure.  She was a character I really liked as well.  Mainly because she made Talia believe that there were different options out there for her.  She was the one who believed the most in Talia, until Talia did something she didn't like - even if it wasn't Talia's fault.  Even towards the very end, she stood up for what she believed in.<br /><br />The story line for this book was okay.  And, I'm really impressed that for a book that was published seven years ago, it stills hold that edge that good dystopian books do.  I won't say it's as good as some I've read, but it wasn't the worst either.  And I definitely liked some of the world-building behind it.  It could have been expanded more, but at least I knew the theory behind them becoming a Uglies/Pretties society.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dystopian novels and who doesn't mind the pace being a bit slow at the start.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read this book a few months ago and thought it was incredible and when I got my kindle this was exactly the first book I looked up.<br /> when I read the book it was kind of hard at first because it had a lot of western talk if you know what I mean. another thing is that this book inspired me to read about huckleberry finn

0399157565|1.0|I have read all of her books, but the last 4-5 have taken a weird disturbing, not fun to read course. Maybe she is going the way of Cussler as she get's really old and is relying on ghost writers. In this case and a few previous, the ghost writer is a really weird, sadistic, homophobe, who feels old blonde women  are still hot, even if their attributes have sagged. Any hope for the future? Or more of the same trash?

1594484805|5.0|Daniel Pink takes the science of motivation and explains it in a way that is understandable and usable.  These concepts are important for anyone who works with people.  Schools and businesses would profit from organizing their motivational systems around these ideas.  He explains the limits of contingent, if-then positive reinforcement techniques.  Pink's treatise also helps one understand how to foster people's own intrinsic motivation.

B008458O3S|5.0|My first review ever for any android anything ever. It's that good. I was hooked immediately. Couldn't put it down. No hitches or glitches at all. Only one minor quip. Wish it would override the screen off timer. But as I said minor.

0763619795|5.0|I have this book and it is one of the most enjoyable children's book I have read in a long time.I love that it comes with it's own stuffed toy bear.The stuffed bear is a good size bear for your child to cuddle while you read this enchanting book to him or her about hunting for a bear.It will bring it more to life for your child while you read the book together.The illustrations in this book are fun and enjoyable to look at.This is a must to add to your child/children's library.I give it a thumbs up and 5 stars our of 5 stars.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Have been a long time fan of J.K. Rowling's writing and I must say I'm a bit shocked by the use of the \\"C\\" word. Every time I read the word I cringe. I found the story to be real oppressive and slow moving. I have yet to finish it, while with her other books I couldn't put down. It's disappointing.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Awesome to finally have all the columbia CDs remastered. Every Fan needs this set. I will admit I was a little bit afraid that the CD sleeves would be thinner as I have bought other Sony sets and the sleevs were almost paper thin and flimsy. Very happy these sleeves are thicker and pretty easy to remove the CD as well.<br /><br />Each album sounds great and it is wonderful that they are not all compressed and extra loud like alot of CDs now days. These were done right<br /><br />Imaginos sounds better too though there is still the volume going down and then up on \\"I Am the One You Warned Me Of\\" that was present on the original release in 88. I always wondered how this was missed or let go open original release?<br /><br />Since this set is selling so well along with them doing the reunion show with original members that maybe it will give them the desire to do another album and maby a bigger lable to sign them.... maybe even Columbia to re sign them?  :)

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Again the sex scenes aren't my thing but the story was so addicting I was able to get past them.  I was really happy to have an actual ending instead of a cliffhanger.  Great way to end the series.

0670026182|5.0|This book is absolutely gorgeous, the people who wrote otherwise must be nuts. The imagery is rich, vibrant and moody. Katie has set the stage for many food photographers out there. Not to mention the recipes are great, well rounded and easy to prepare. I've been following Katie's blog for years and have and will remain one of her biggest fans. There is nothing else on the market like it, her use of typography and photography are unique and solely hers. This cookbook is a hit, simply put.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|What can I say, it's Led Zeppelin! I love anything from the band! They, as well as Yes were me favorite bands growing up in the 70's. It doesn't get better then this. I have the vinyl, but I'm trying to replace all of them with digital.

B005HNG1S0|5.0|Helene Grimaud brings her usual drama to two Mozart piano concertos, lifting them above the ordinary.  A real gem in the recording is the lovely aria by Mojca Erdmann, a rising young German soprano.  Highly recommended for both artists.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Everyone who likes this short enought to buy the dvd knows this was a project payed entirely by Whedon, with little exterior help. And the DVD really passed that image, in a 'non-pathetic-two-bucks-crappy-disc' way. The disc is a DVD-R, purple and everything. It doesn't make it less durable or changes the quality, it will last as long as any other pressed disc you have, but it makes the indie thing sounds way more visible.<br />The extras are the same as always: interviews, behind the scenes, one or two easter eggs, and the commentary. The Commentary, by the way, is a Musical with little to no relation with the movie whatsoever. The musical is about itself, \\"breaking the ninth wall\\" as they say at some point of it.<br />I recommend buying it for the fans, and, since it's cheap, maybe for introducing others into the show
B000PA9Q6E|2.0|If &#34;Hard again&#34; is one of your favorites, and if you think this will be more of the same.......Sorry!<br />It simply is not!  It may be that these are cuts from the same sessions, but there is a real good<br />reason they didn't make it on the prime CDs......they are sub-standard quality....they are the<br />culls......It was very disappointing........This is somebody trying to hustle a buck on the reputation<br />of some really fine music, which this isn't......sorry, but that's the truth.
0525953728|5.0|THis is an excellent effort by one of the SEALs involved in the mission to kill or capture Bin Laden.  The authors have done a fantastic job of making the reader feel he is on the ground with the SEAL elements who conducted the operation.  Very even-handed in its depiction of what happened on operations before the mission, the political decision making and the training leading up to the actual event, readers will appreciate the real story about one of the most important missions in SEAL histroy.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Standing Ovation is Susan Boyle's tribute to musical theater.  Beautifully accompanied by the London Philharmonic, Boyle's<br />song interpretations are memorable.  However, after four albums, it would be nice to hear her sing something that is a little more up tempo once in awhile.  She does an admirable job singing a duet with Michael Crawford.  Although Donny Osmond is apparently one of Boyle's lifelong idols, he is a poor choice for the other two duets on the album.  He does not have a big enough voice to take on Broadway musicals. Nonetheless, the album is a very enjoyable rendition of some of the stage's most enduring classics, and Boyle's voice has never been better.
0316228532|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book(narrated by Tom Hollander.)  It is a masterpiece that propels JK Rowling into another dimension of artistry.  I am a huge fan of her Harry Potter series and was aware that this novel was a deviation from children's lit into a more mature direction.  It is gritty, realistic, profane, sadistic, deeply disturbing in parts.  It challenges the reader to understand the characters motives and not judge them only on their actions.  At it's core, it is a character study that totally engages the reader and makes you care about the outcome for each character.  This book inspires comparison to some of my other favorite authors, Roddy Doyle and even Barbara Vine (minus the mystery).  Tom Hollander's narration was perfect in every way.  His vocal gymnastics portrayed each character with it's own voice and personality.  I have contemplated some of the negative reviews on this site and wonder if these reviewers would have been so harsh had the author not had another book series that had such an impact as HP.  Some reviewers seem almost angry that Rowling would deign to \\"turn over the rock\\" of the human experience and explore the ugliest aspects of life.  However, after reading this book, one comes away with a deeper compassion for others who we may have judged unfairly.  One sees her profound respect for the teenage trial --the terror and humilation of the teenage years that as adults we slowly forget.  Rowling allows her characters to adapt and to change for the better or worse. This book has inspired me to be more compassionate toward others and less judgemental.

It has pathos, tragedy, but most of all, life.  I listened to the audio version, and the reader is superb.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so addictive that when I got it I played for and hour and a half and still love it! its so much fun to try and figure it out
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My favorite Grisham book ever with a surprise ending! Every character will draw you in and you literally will not be able to put it down, a great read!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I've never watched the original series to this movie, but as a first timer I'll have to say I really enjoyed this movie! It has a dark and definitely shadowy underpinning, but it was fun to watch and the comedic overtone was very well integrated. Depp's acting always seems to totally display the various aspects of the character he's playing, and didn't disappoint in this movie.
0307888908|5.0|Reid is right on in teaching how to have an attitude of working for yourself, rather than a typical  \\"employee\\" attitude. His philosophy of approaching work as your own company, \\"YOU,\\" will go a long way in helping people looking for work or those who are dissatisfied with their career.  It is really up to us to take the situation in control and manage our own lives, including work!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Spectacular movie, no matter where I watch it or with whom, it always seems to please everyone all around.  Make sure to buy it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm not in the target market for the shirtless-Fabio-by-the-mansion-on-the-cliff-overlooking-the-stormy-sea novel. That needed to be said in all fairness, and because the converse would be pretty embarrassing. This was an off-the-cuff kindle order inspired by the sheer number of women that I've come into contact with who are talking about this book, although they don't say very much before turning beet red and changing the subject. That, in itself, is intriguing.<br /><br />The basic plot involves a pretty college coed who interviews a handsome young CEO (not the usual kind of CEO, but it's a novel) for the school paper, and is gradually drawn into a sado-masochistic/bondage-domination relationship. There isn't any coercion involved. In fact, the CEO actually provides a written (though non-binding) \\"contract\\" defining the parameters of the proposed relationship for the coed to review and accept before they proceed. She is under no preassure either way, and is fully aware of what she's getting involved with. There is even a negotiation phase prior to the final agreement being reached. It's pretty obviously not a \\"romance novel\\" in the usual sense; No burning-love-at-first-sight kind of stuff.<br /><br />No more details, lest I spoil something for those who are afraid that this kind of thing can actually be spoiled, but I'll offer an observation; In contrast with guy-porn, wherein the coed would meet the CEO, engage in a few minutes of flirtatious small talk, rapidly proceeded by boinking on the desktop, the fax machine, the paper shredder, the rug, the desk again... and so on and so fourth; Chick Porn (if this book is representative of the genre) is just as graphic in it's description of the sex itself, however, suffers the reader to endure endless ruminating about what she's thinking, which is mostly trying to figure out what he's thinking, and if he's thinking about what she's thinking about, and if he's thinking that she's thinking that he's thinking...(ouch, yes,men find this painfull) until one wonders how the human species survived this long.

0316228532|2.0|I read the whole book, it is about the dislocation of the lives of others when the one good person in the community dies. Barry (the dead guy) is the about the only person in the book who is not trashed. There are far too many characters, you must make a list. The book is also about class and politics in a small town but the focus wanders. Because the book takes place in England it is loaded with vulgar English slang, I think many Americans would not understand some of it. Like many others I kept giving the author the benefit of the doubt because I had so enjoyed the Harry Potter series; I think the book is a waste of time and money.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Very enjoyable and addictive.  Can't finish for the continuous updates.  Good job to the creators.  Great game for quick timeoyt.

B004MYF4SS|5.0|This was a gripping read from start to finish. Main characters were well developed, complex, yet realistic. The story line flipped effortlessly between past and present with lots of unexpected twists and turns. Loved the detail of life on Lewis, past and present. May's description of the landscape painted a vivid picture and I'm now planning a visit to these islands next spring. The gugga hunt was a wonderful piece of social history. A great read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Although I enjoy Grisham's style, this book did not meet his usual standards of high suspense and twisting curves I have become to expect.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|If I had to choose only 5 movies (of any genre) to last a lifetime, this would be one of them. The incredible scenery and musical score alone make this a movie to treasure. The opening 5 minutes of the film are unforgettably brilliant.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Got this game and can't stop playing until all puzzles are done. I love it and stay up into all hours of the night finishing the newest releases!
1423165691|5.0|Just love it.  I have enjoyed watching the transformation and it really is a very nice coffe table type book.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|The book was great! The movie did not express the same excitement as the book did and it strayed from the book. The movie was pretty far flung at the end with the legions of vampires fighting union soldiers and the silver bullets being hauled in the train.
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|The premise is thin, the action hits hard and fast, and it's completely popcornworthy. That said, I found it odd that accomplished actors like Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe appeared in this flick, but I guess everyone has bills to pay or a few days that you just don't want to take seriously.<br /><br />So, here's the story. It's classical China. A shipment of gold is being sent to the hinterlands (cue the spaghetti western music). The Lion Clan, who mostly seem to have haircuts like Jareth from [[ASIN:B00000K3D4 Labyrinth]], have an internal power shift and decide the gold is theirs. A brave few stand against the bullies and (no suprise here) win the day. Throw in some wildly improbable weapons, remarkable gymnastics, and a pocketful of anachronisms, and you've pretty much got it. (Were those cuties of negotiable affection really wearing fishnets and hotpants in classical China?)<br /><br />Given the general inanity, it shouldn't have annoyed me the three non-Asians in the flick had three of the four leading roles - of course, Liu filled that out. As in so many movies from [[ASIN:B001ELDYOI Shangri-La]] on, and even before that, the Asian majority consisted largely of spear-carriers (figuratively or not), and even Liu wasn't really one of the good guys. Well, at least there was one black among non-Asians: RZA who (incidentally) not only starred but wrote and directed as well.<br /><br />Don't get your hopes up, and it's sure to exceed them.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1119962846|1.0|This book isn't worth the money because it does't offer anything that isn't already available on the Internt for free. It's a waste of paper.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It had everything I like in a mystery..I couldn't figure out what was going to happen next. It's hard to say what I'd like to about this book without giving away the end..but I recommend this highly!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Such a disappointment after the initial book.  Storyline is difficult to follow and the character names added to the confustion

0984725113|2.0|The authors do an excellent job of diagnosing our current dilemmas of automation, low wages and other elements of the great recession.<br /><br />However they make the mistake of proposing solutions to these dilemmas.  I was flabbergasted at how truly rediculous many of their \\"solutions\\" are.  In one example, they assert that in order to improve the capabilities of the US workforce we should increase immigration of mid-level workers! As important as new talent is to this country, how in heaven does that help our existing workforce?  (I kid you not, this is what they propose)  On the educational front they state that children in K-12 should be allowed to choose their own curriculum!  Would choosing your own curriculum in, say, the 5th grade have improved your preparation for working in the modern world?<br /><br />Then they assert that education for the new high tech world should place more emphasis on the Arts!  (Don't get me wrong, I like art)  To pretend that training in the arts will give students a leg up when they enter the workforce (which is exactly what they say) is ludicrous.<br /><br />I have to ask, who are these people that they think they have anything serious to say how to create a viable future?  They need to focus on analysis and stay away from policy making.
1603427244|5.0|\\"Cast On Bind Off\\" has 54 methods for casting on and binding off. The booklet starts with Cast Ons and ends with Bind Offs.  This is a great little addition to a knitter's library and I like the small size as it fits comfortably in my knitting bag for Knit Nights without weighing me down.  Yesterday, I used it to learn the 3 needle bind off and I found the directions and illustration easy to follow.<br /><br />The book contains 33 cast ons and 21 bind offs.  Each is clearly illustrated with pictures so that you can follow the steps. The cast ons are divided into basic, stretchy, decorative, double-sided, circular, multi-color, provisional, tubular and mobius. The bind offs are also helpfully divided into basic, stretchy, decorative and sewn. All are clearly illustrated and easy to follow. I quickly found the 3 needle bind off in the book and followed the directions and illustration with excellent results.<br /><br />As a fairly novice knitter, I feel the illustrations and directions are easy for me to follow and understand. This book is well worth the investment.

B00846REIS|5.0|I'll start by saying that if you're offended by a dominant man, this story is not for you.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is a strong man, he's had to be given his history, it may not be how you might have coped, or even I would have coped, but I get it. He is broken and he is damaged but he is carrying on the best he know how.<br /><br />Enter Eva Tramell, messing with his very well organized life. These 2 are in essence a clash of titans, they're both wealthy, attractive young people with more issues than the National Geographic, and the clash is hot, painful, messy, sweet, and disturbing. Once I picked this book up, I couldn't and didn't put it down for anything!<br /><br />I think suspension of disbelief is important to any book, and as long as you can do that this story has fabulous characters, hot sex galore, and an interesting storyline.
B002JIEYLC|5.0|I already knew the album was great, it's over 30 years old and considered a classic, so I must comment on the shopping experience. The quality of the product, the price, the packaging, and the delivery were all great.

B007EW9ISM|4.0|I have tried about 5 different types of stylus for my Ipad in the past year and my conclusion is that the best two stylus out there are the followings:<br />- this one, Cosmonaut which has the best feeling when you hold it....it is really a pleasure to write with this pen...the only improvement I would suggest is the tip.  The tips is probably the best rubber tip I have tried yet...much harder than the standard rubber and it seems indestructible...but it is rubber!..which means that it gives some sort of resistance when writing.  Instead I would recommend a metal fabric tip like the New Trent Limir<br /><br />- The New Trent Limir:  this pen has the fastest and smoothest tip of any stylus I have tried.  Very fast writing.  The stylus is kind of short and thin, so there is a little bit of discomfort when holding it...the Cosmonaut is the master in comfort<br /><br />I use both stylus described above.  The New Trent Limir is good for fast note taking.  Cosmonaut more for sketching.<br /><br />So in conclusion,...if Cosmonaut replaces its tip with a metal fabric, it would look less cool, but it would be just perfect....or the New Trent can just get as bold and comfortable as the Cosmonaut.
1608862801|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. This volume includes the first 4 comics in the series. It is way more colorful and art driven then I was expecting. The pages look and feel more like a high quality magazine then a comic. This is a perfect purchase for people who like the show, or to introduce young readers to comics.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great book, I was not disappointed, John Grisham is one of  my favorite author and I am already  looking forward to reading his next book.
0385535147|2.0|......as the book progressed I changed my thoughts substantially. No one in the book is likeable! Period! The victim is on the take, the murderer is scum, the FBI stupid, the &#34;hero&#34;, his girlfriend and her brother are all despicable people and in the end just plain thieves. That's all I'll say about them without being a complete spoiler! To believe this book you have to suspend your believability in time and space as it rushes past and the probability of all the things that happen working out is very unbelievable and the FBI, having (a little spoiler here) having been conned and made fools of by the  &#34;hero&#34; should have been on high alert for either of his 2 passports, or his girlfriends, showing up at customs when he comes back to the US to get his ill gotten gains! Overall, a disappointing book that shows that unfortunately Grisham's &#34;best days&#34; are far behind him! His classics like &#34;The Firm&#34;, &#34;The Runaway Jury&#34;, and my personal favourite , &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; are but sad memories for all of his fans!

B0089BSM70|5.0|This particular film in the Halloween doesn't seem to get the credit it deserves and often instead seems to get dismissed as being just another terrible sequel in the franchise. While there are a lot of bad sequels in the series, Rick Rosenthal's Halloween 2 is not one of them. Its true that it doesn't compare to the quality of John Carpenter's original but it stands on its own enough to be a legitimate and entertaining sequel.<br /><br />The film picks up immediately where Carpenter's film ended. Loomis goes out onto the balcony to find Michael's body....gone. He immediately runs out into the front yard and continues his pursuit of Michael while the paramedics arrive and take Laurie to the hospital.<br /><br />The film has some great bonus features including featuring both the theatrical version and the extended television version of the movie. It also has a commentary track from Rick Rosenthal and Leo Rossi (he played Bud the ambulance driver) and a detailed making of Halloween 2 featurette that goes into great detail describing the process that it took to get Halloween 2 to the screen including some very blunt interviews from the cast, crew and producers.<br /><br />Its a must have for a Halloween or horror fan.

1619691884|5.0|This audio recording of Christopher Hitchens' cancer diary, written for Vanity Fair, is excellent.  It's also very, very tough to hear.  Reading what Hitch wrote at my own pace, in monthly doses so to speak, as it was published originally, was relatively easy - sad content written brilliantly.  Hearing an actor's presentation kicks things up a notch, driving harder.  If you have a loved one undergoing treatment for cancer, this will both expand your understanding of the situation and break your heart.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I was surprised of how much fun this game was. i wasnt expecting much but i play this game almost every day, becuase it is very addictive.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Now out of all the movies that came out this year i was really shocked to see that this one was much better than I thought. I had low expectations for this movie but it turned out to be really good. Will was funny in it actually much better than that lame ass last sequel. Tommy Lee wasn't in this one as much but Josh Brolin really did his thing to play a young Tommy Lee. Him and Will definitely made the movie worth while. I will pick this one up on blu ray upon its release.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I enjoyed reading The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. It made a long car ride go much faster. The characters were created in a quirky manner--some more believable than others. The premise of the book seemed far fetched at first but after a while you could see why Harold Fry was making the journey and accepted that fact. The main twist in the book was a surprise which I did not see coming and I liked the happy ending.
B005LAII1C|4.0|This movie was pretty funny I can't lie. Ted talks straight shit and it is vulgar but hilarious. Mark Whalberg was actually kinda funny as well and they made the movie work well together. I might consider purchasing this maybe on regular dvd though but we will see.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Seller and Amazon provided a great buying experience. The product itself is easily adjustable and fits comfortably. Keep in mind that the mag carriers are built in (as advertised) so you cannot move them. They are placed exactly as I want them, though, so this was a good buy for me.<br /><br />I run 6 mil-spec STANAG magazines for my primary along with 4 Springfield XDM 9mm 19-round magazines for secondary, a first aid kit in MOLLE pouch on right of the mags, two silencer pouches and a 1-liter water bottle carrier on the left. The pistol mag pouch straps are attached via velcro, so you can adjust them to fit a variety length pistol magazines.<br /><br />Keep in mind, the pouches are intended to keep your gear secure, not to provide speed loads. Getting the STANAG mags out of the kangaroo pouches isn't bad. Putting one back in can be a challenge, especially under stress. If you want to retain all your mags, you will probably either need a dump pouch or a lot of practice (always a good idea anyway).<br /><br />The straps nicely padded so a full load is comfortable, while fitting snugly enough to not rattle around. There is no obvious means of attaching this to a belt so your lower back may feel the strain if you load heavily and wear long-term, but the trade-off is much greater freedom of movement in your torso than with a tight tactical vest.<br /><br />You may find that the carrier rides higher on your midsection than you expected, which you can adjust if you like, but keep in mind you may need that clearance to be comfortable sitting and to not interfere with any belt you may choose to wear along with it.<br /><br />I have not had the chance to torture test this carrier yet, so a few months of use and abuse will tell if it holds up. So far, I'm quite pleased with it. Just keep in mind how you want to run your gear. If the magazine/pistol pouches aren't where you want them, look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's a pretty good deal.
B005LAII80|5.0|Incredible movie nothing at all like the wack 1995 Stallone version. Straight up raw movie with a great character developing story and lots of BLOODY action which is what I love! I will definitely get this when it comes out on blu ray. This movie should have made well over 100 million what the hell is wrong with America? Go see this now!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Boring. Too many people to follow, no flow.  She should stick to what she did best and leave the adult world to itself.
B009MO5960|4.0|After seeing Afterlife I thought this would definitely be wack but this one actually turned out to be better than Afterlife. The story is still the same ol that we are use to which is not much. The Resident Evil Movies have never been great story tellers but they have always been entertaining... well at least the first three. This one really made up for the last one so if you were disappointed like I was by the last one then check this one out. By the way this is really 3 and half stars not four.
B004LCF9RW|3.0|So this is not what I thought it would be, for 2 reasons: one) I must have missed that this particular DVD version only has French in the spoken version, with Spanish subtitles! While this does not bother me, since I master both, it did, however, not help my husband, who only speaks American English, lol.  Second, if you saw the original Emmanuelle, you might find that this E-2 lacks the freshness of the story line E-1 is displaying. As with many 2nds and 3rds, etc..., the story line suffers and becomes \\"flat\\" or repetitive, and in this case, both. There is not much interaction on the level of the couple, as in the E-1, they meet, have some sex, and go their merry ways with separate adventures. Also, the husband is not the same actor this time (Umberto Orsini) as in 1. While in the first one, it is all about the definition of the \\"erotic education\\" of Emmanuelle, in this one, she is just going from one little adventure to the next. And frankly, one wonders what should be the specific reason for these haphazardly encounters. Eroticism: yes, some  -  but the spirit of the \\"Emmanuelle\\" line of eroticism, not so much! But, on the up-side: the story stays within the realm of what is referred to as \\"soft porn\\" in this country: no explicit shots.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|SO the Dark Knight Rises had high expectations and to be honest it was a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong it was a good movie just not great. The character development was not nearly as good as the first two films and it wasn't quite as innovative. Bane's character was not as interesting as lets say the Dark Knight or The Scarecrow. This movie was still entertaining regardless and the story was well put together. The reason it gets a four star instead of five is because it did disappoint a lil bit IMO. Still a good movie so check it out!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is addicting. only thing is, I never have enough coins, and I will not buy them with real money. so I have to wait till they regenerate which takes a whole night....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft on the computer and the XBOX_360 but the pocket edition does need some work so here's why. First and for most, in this version, redstone practically has no meaning so what Mojang needs to do is give redstone its meaning. Second, Mojang needs to keep the pocket edition up to date with the computer and XBOX version. Third, villages, mobs, and even the portals in Minecraft for example, the Nether and Ender portals. Fourth and finally, a more expansive variety of weapons and tools would be nice. This is what I think of Minecraft PE and I hope some people agree. Even though there are definitely some weak spots in this app, I know this app certainly had potential
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok until you have to pay to keep playing. but I like looking for objects. just wish it was really free though out the whole game.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|Look, I read the book and it was just ok.  The movie was just terrible.  The writing, acting but worst of all the editing.  It was o choppy and disjointed.  Also the make up o age people just a joke.  Skip it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is totally awesome!It gives you a great challenge.If you're bored and don't know anything to for fun-thid game will relieve that and name you play it all the time!Sooooooo adicting! Love it so much!!!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Johnny Depp is a great and talented actor. they did well to pick him to play Barnabas Collins. what really helps this movie is the supporting cast. Altogether, they bring a new undead life to the set.<br />Helping is the setting of 1972 with all the props and language.<br />I highly recommend this to one and all
B0071T4BVC|5.0|We all know that Sir Paul's voice isn't as good as it used to be but it is perfect for the type of songs on this album.<br />Absolutely love it!
B0037471TE|4.0|Thought it would be like the film just a bit different but it's nothing like the film and so much better.

B009HEJXFS|5.0|Wrote this before watching the movie....<br />I loved the two previous movies so i will buy this movie because of the sentimental<br />Value. Hope to see the english bulldog roughed up again, i was howling with laughter<br />:)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game for all ages. My nine yr old has it on his phone let me play. I had to get it for mine. I let my 14yr old try it and she downloaded it. We are all totally junkies now.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome. i have had this game for very long and had no problems with it....overall great game
B000002LAC|5.0|What an amazing job of blending their voices. Sounds as if they have sung together forever. Many great song choices. Track #6 with Linda R. leading is fabulous and the lyrics to Dolly Parton's &#34;Wildflowers&#34; are touching and still relevant even tho this was put together in the mid-1980&#34;s. Great women's music.
B000031WBV|3.0|I love Chopin music and am still learning all the pieces of music that he wrote.  This cd was just a little boring for me.  Not any fault of Arthur Rubinstein.  Just like other Chopin cd's.  Thanks again!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I ordered The Secret of the Wings to give as a birthday gift for my 12 year old granddaughter.  I had been a bit concerned that this movie might be too young for her but she and her friends love this movie.  I had ordered it less than two weeks before her birthday and the movie arrived with more than a week to spare.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Another great movie that you had for me to order!  I hope you keep having these great movies.  Thanks so much!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This book is just as gripping as the hunger games. As a must read, it will please all ages, however I would not recommend it to people who are easily scared or have nightmares about gory books...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is one of the most convenient I had. it gives me an excuse to use my Kindle Fire during math when there's something to do with calculators. I 100% recommend this under all expectations you might have.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|I like this app because it takes strategy.It works really well for kindles and kindle fires.It is fun but it gets hard.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This is my favorite show of all time.  I was disappointed by season 5.  Season 6 made me a believer again.  Seriously disturbed fun with all the twists and turns I expect from Dexter.
0307592731|1.0|This summer, I started my hike at Walker Pass, where I left off last year. Even before I got on the PCT, I'd heard about this woman who'd written a book about her experience on the trail, who'd been a heroin junkie and gotten herself straightened out. As my friends and I met dayhikers on the trail, they would excitedly ask, \\"Have you read that book by Cheryl Strayed? And now, here we are on the P-C-T, JUST like her!!\\" A thru-hiker who was slightly ahead of me, Mother Goose, was accosted by one such woman, and after they parted ways, Mother Goose caught up to me and spat out, \\"If I hear another word about that Strayed woman, I'm gonna strangle 'em!\\" By the time I got off the trail in Ashland, I, too, was sick of hearing about this book - even my co-workers back home had read it. When one of them offered to let me borrow \\"Wild,\\" a few weeks ago, I thought that maybe reading the book would ease my longing for the trail.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that transports you to a long-distance trail, look elsewhere - so far, my favorite has been the Barefoot Sisters' two books. Even though Bill Bryson's book, \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" is also a lame attempt to describe a long-distance hike, he has a sense of humor and pokes a LOT of fun at everything. It is not a whine-fest.<br /><br />Strayed complains CONSTANTLY about blisters and pack sores and the weight of her pack and her missing toenails. EVERYTHING reminds her of her mother, so the reader is forced to re-hash her miserable life, a perfect graveyard of broken hopes. I know that everyone has to start somewhere - certainly my pack was too heavy the first time I went out...and it was still too heavy when I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail. Nearly everyone gets blisters on these long-distance hikes - but complaining about them incessantly is obnoxious. I often hike solo - I am a female - and many times, I wanted to simply throttle Strayed.<br /><br />Her details about the trail are so sketchy that it makes me wonder whether she actually hiked more than a half dozen short sections. It is obvious that she did a LOT of yellow-blazing (a somewhat derogatory term in the hiking community for hitchhiking up the trail, rather than actually walking it). I wanted her to meet the hikers on the trail and give them personalities and I *really* wanted her to learn from them. I wanted to read about the towns and the places she went to (and be able to say, \\"I WAS THERE!!!\\") I wanted her to describe sunsets and views and remind me of how it was to walk up out of Seiad Valley and the effort it took to avoid the poison oak down into Belden Town and what it was like to swim in the Middle Fork of the Feather River and to be back at the great campsite with an unobstructed view of Mt. Shasta, feeling the gravel pressing into my hips and shoulder blades through my groundcloth because I'd given up my leaking therm-a-rest - except I wanted HER stories about her hike, not more reasons for which I felt like I needed to give her ANOTHER dope slap - and I could have used a lot LESS of the shock-value bits: the horse, the swearing, the sex scene on the beach.<br /><br />She could have easily had this entire experience in rehab - it did not have to be on the PCT. She could have wallowed in her self-pity and lack of preparation in a matter of ten pages and realized her mother crossed the bridge in another two and that would have been plenty. I know now WHY so many hikers this summer disdained Cheryl Strayed and her \\"hike.\\" If it was the TRAIL that changed her, she would still be more connected to it than just by throwing money at the PCTA every year - she would be back out there every chance she got. This book is just further proof that it is sex, drugs & rock 'n' roll that sells. If it had ACTUALLY been about the PCT, Oprah never would have read it.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|ok the thing is on my kindell it disinter work well its hard and I love it I don't like thebsneek mode its is hard to make work
B008NABUU8|5.0|I like playing this game against my 6-year old.  He's doing a lot better than I am.  For a game with some engineering concepts as part of the challenge, it really made me wonder what does this tell me about him.  Fun game for all to at least try.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|i have been wanting this for a long time and so glad i bought it . it was refeshing and truley  worth the investmet that i made .i would highly recomond it to any diana ross fan

B0090YHSFC|5.0|This is a very fun &amp; addictive game/app... Lots of levels &amp; obstacles, too. Great way to waste time...once you start, you won't. stop! Best played with a stylus...the penguins are fast! Enjoy!
0446580848|3.0|So good that he paired up Paul Brenner (who stars in a few Nelson's books) with John Corey. I got annoyed at the one thing I like best about the Corey novels; excessive sarcasm. Others reviews have stated that there wasn't enough action. I actually enjoyed learning about Yemen and the preface of the \\"mission.\\" The ending sucked but leaves a wide berth for another novel to tie up loose ends between Corey, Brenner, and the CIA spooks, Chet and Buck. Stay tuned! I certainly will to see John and Paul extract vengence with the CIA who wronged them BIG TIME.
B005MW6IRU|4.0|Heavy Metal, mixed with Pink Floyd, Mixed with Steve Miller Band. Great songs, great production. I would definitely reccomend this album.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Well, when Oprah recommends a book, there is a very good chance that it's a good book, worth reading.  But I have to admit that as I read the beginning chapters, I found myself thinking \\"Oprah, have you lost your mind?\\"  I decided to try to finish it.  I'm glad I did.  It got better, but I've read much better hiking-the-outdoors-treking-in-the-wilderness books.  This story is more a tale of one young imature woman's amazing self-redemption after extended wallowing in grief for years after her mother died, all the while indulging in self-destructive behavior and then hitting bottom. My favorite parts of the book centered around reading the descriptions of the PCT and the kindness of the people she met along the way.
1469984202|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year. Does what good sci fi should, sets up good what if's, compelling characters.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|Corey is an idiot.<br />He continually spoils this book with his smart ass remarks that would probably best suit teenagers ( not smart ones ).<br />The author has spoiled a good story in my estimation
B009SQOGZ2|1.0|Flee from evil.<br /><br />More lies produced to inculcate our children, from the father of lies. The Bible tells us that when we \\"speak to the dead\\" we actually talk to demons/fallen angels. Don't be deceived. Leviticus 19:31 is but one of many instructions against necromancy. \\"Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.\\"
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor does not disappoint. Fun and upbeat songs along with emotional slow songs. I only skip one or two songs and loved them the first time I heard them.
B009D5VNLS|2.0|Brave did not surprise me, good or bad. The animated movie was cute but not deep enough to warrant admiration. The animation was good, but not great. It was ok for my wife and I to spend a couple hours of light entertainment. Good movie for elementary school age children.
B008KTA64S|4.0|I love almost every song in this album.<br />too hard to pick which, to love more.<br />(i like all but sliver, it's why i gave it 4 instead of 5)

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Finally a book that I just could not put down! I enjoyed it immensely. The plot just kept getting more and more intriguing. I was not disappointed with any of it.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I bought the book based on a friend's recommendation. It is like many books of this type - a story told by an amature like he was sitting at a bar swapping war stories with his buddies. I deeply appreciate what the author has been through and I am thankful America has men so dedicated; however, I wish the author had used some professional writer to help tell the story.
0375507256|1.0|This book was painful to read. The first page was ok but after that it was downright awful. Almost gave up midway through chapter one, again in chapter 2, again in chapter 5 but forced my way through. Not a good book, how it got 4 stars overall is beyond me. I think people give it high ratings because they think it makes them sound smart.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I bought and was charged for more credits to buy bingo cards and they never showed up on the game.  I will scrap this game, it doesn't make since to purchase a game and then have to continue to pay to use it and then not get what I paid for to continue.  Contacted the game and heard nothng back.  I will not purchase another game that I will have to pay to continue playing at some point.  So many available to purchase with a one time fee and you're done.
B00006AFF5|4.0|I'm not going to rate this movie on anything other than the actual content in the movies. This review is NOT for VHS/DVD/Blu Ray bonus content, video quality, make-up, music (although if you're interested in the music, I have a review for the soundtrack as well!), or the chosen actors. If you're here for that, go elsewhere, because I'm not offering it!<br />This movie tells the story of a poor soul that everybody is scared of and that nobody really \\"likes.\\" The character is portrayed as a moderately evil (Dr. Seuss style) character that is misunderstood and has a dark past, which is why he hates Christmas.<br />Having said that, this movie is basically saying that anybody can be a dark and misunderstood person that nobody \\"likes,\\" but it's the inside that counts. This sort of thing is told over the course of the film, in a rather drug-out way. However, the film is touching and a wonderful Christmas movie!<br />I will watch this every year with my family!
B00541ML4S|4.0|It's a lens cap.  Fit just fine.  I was happy with this purchase.  Probably could use a way to attach to the lens.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I'd watch anything with Judy Dench in it, but she's in really good company in this movie.  The cast is exceptional, and it's a well-written script, with a lot of humor, warmth and excellent character development.  You'll leave it with warm fuzzies. Highly recommended!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|This is a book about the power of Rebus. His return is spectacular, and Rankin uses it as a stage to set his tale of old verses new in policing - the personal/networking/booze-soaked/rule-bending Rebus verses the clean, internet-powered world of modernity. Seeing Rebus share the pages with other favorites - Cafferty, Fox and Clarke is great fun. The story features some fantastic set-piece moments, such as Sharon's interrogation technique, Rebus' meeting in Glasgow and a star-turn by a small dog. The tale reads like a greatest hits of past novels too - right back to Knots and Crosses. Edinburgh is too small to hold this one and 'Rebus' is too small a word for it - this is real liquid engineering.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|No matter what religious view you bring with you when you read this story, you will be impressed with the detail, the sincerity, and the intellectual honesty of the author.<br />He has no axe to grind, and nowhere is a sense that the author has 'found the truth'.<br />He is searching for the truth, and this story reveals the journey that brought him to the edge of life and back.<br />This is a man who understands how the brain works, so he understands and probably opined at some point about the hard wired 'light at the end of the tunnel' theory.<br />And yet, here is a true believer, not in dogma, but in a greater world in which we play a role, from where we come and to where we go.<br />It is comforting, ultimately comforting.<br />Then, cynics, do your worst.<br />I love this book.<br />Thank you, sir, for certainly suffering the criticism of your peers, and thank you mostly for knowing this was an important book to write, and a document from which to learn.<br />Love. Life. Experience.  You can do no wrong.<br />Why not?

0525953728|2.0|Skip the first 75% of this book, it's Owen's grandiose combat history. For HIS redacted version of the \\"killing of Bin Laden, read last par from where they are about to embark on the mission. His ignorant, snotty cheap shots at his president made me I'll! I. e, \\"p193<br />\\"And we'll get Obama  re-elected for sure,\\" Walt said.<br />\\"We had seen it before when he took credit for the Captain Phillips rescue. Although we applauded the decision-making in this case, there was no doubt in anybody's mind that he would take all the political credit for this too.\\"<br />None of us were big fans of Obama. We respected him as the commander in chief of the military and for giving us the green light on the mission.\\"<br />Owen, p275<br />\\"We were tools in their toolbox and when things go well they promote it. They inflate their roles.\\"<br />on VP Biden: Biden, \\". . .

(Obama had invited the whole team to his residence for a beer. p282)<br />Walt's smirk was back.<br />\\"You believed that shit,\\" he said. \\"I bet you voted for change too, sucker.\\"<br />I'm unsure what Owen wants or expects. He is angry at the story being leaked (for Obama's political advancement he thinks) yet he really is mad that he and the team were ignored. Fortunately he's retired now.<br />Read Mark Bowden's book \\"The Finish\\" instead, it's better researched and written.<br />Owen was a better SEAL than he is a writer. Save your money and read it for free at a library!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Although I haven't finished the book yet I am totally engulfed in it. This book is one of the better military type books I have read. If you loved the recent \\"No Easy Day\\" you'll love this book. It's a must read!!!
B00884GR0W|1.0|I decided to give this a try.  I have rarely disliked a game so much so quickly.  the controls are awkward and clumsy, the crafting is an exercise in tedium, and after about ten minutes of trying to do anything that vaguely resembles fun - with no luck whatsoever - I have given up on this completely.

0316286850|2.0|I received the book and it was large. Larger than I was expecting so I was excited expecting to see lots of nice pictures and details. In a way I did get that. However I found a lot of the pictures to be kind of dull and chalky. There were pictures of women that looked plain. Even with the make up. They didn't look pretty to me. The colors were bland and the skin very pale. Just a covering of paleness on the skin. Add lipgloss nicely done hair and that's basically this book picture for picture. Also it told you obvious things like using concealer and lipgloss and mascara erm...der. :/ I don't know I was looking for maybe a collection of colors that would go great for certain eyes and skin types and different looks with those colors. Also it doesn't name anything specific. Like what kind of concealer?? What color are you using on the woman's skin?? How much is it?? Honestly a girl's magazine is better and will tell you more than this book.

B004W1GCQO|5.0|Great first season of Upstairs Downstairs - can't to see all of the next season.  Easy to use download onto my Ipad too!
B004LWZWGA|4.0|4 Stars. This was pretty damn good but it definitely had its problems. Bane's voice was almost impossible to make out most of the time. The addition of Catwoman was okay but nothing really extraordinary. There was very little screen time for Bale which he probably wasn't happy about so this really came off more like 'Bane and Robin' rather than 'Batman and Robin'. The biggest problem though is the first act.<br /><br />It really drags and they could have lost about 10 or 15 minutes to tighten up the pace. Once the second act kicks in though, that's when the whole story becomes really engaging. It's awesome how Bane unintentionally 'recreates' Batman without knowing it. There is definitely some repetition of ideas from the first two which is probably why this is the last one but overall it is probably the darkest of the three. This is definitely better than the latest Spiderman.<br /><br />The criticism about this third chapter not fitting in with the whole series could not be further from the truth. This one really represents the bookending of the entire series. In the first chapter Batman does NOT exist until he escapes from the League of Shadows and the same is true when he escapes from the prison in this one. The great irony of both these movies is that the antagonist in each case actually creates Batman, the only person that can stop them. This is why the first fight with Bane is dismal. It is not because of a lack of physical conditioning, it is because this is not Batman fighting Bane but Bane fighting Bruce Wayne doing the best he can. So in reality it is the second chapter that does 'fit' because Batman already exists from start to finish.<br /><br />This is really the genius of Nolan in full effect. If you can overlook the flaws in directing you will be in a perfect position to see the brilliant story arc and also the spirit of Kane's creation represented accurately in all three films. In other words, Batman is not a suit or gadgets or cars and bikes etc.,but a belief and mindset. When Alfred tries to explain this to Bruce, that he has not been 'Batman' for years, it does not register. No amount of physical training or gadgetry would give him the mindset of the Batman.<br /><br />If you keep this in perspective that Batman is an internal mindset when watching all 3 chapters and not about discrepancies between page and screen that are really the external details, you can see that the essence of Batman has been presented here perfectly.

B0041KVW2K|2.0|I was actually going to save my box set sealed as a collectable.  Based on negative feedback I decided to open it and test the vinyl. I only opened one LP - Abbey Road - and this is a horrible vinyl pressing with some crazy distortion.  It just sounds terrible.  I thought maybe it was my sound system or stylus or whatever so I brought out two other copies of the LP (an original pressing and the blue box pressing) - both played great with no distortion.<br /><br />Too bad I wanted this box set to be great but the vinyl pressing is poor.

0316228532|1.0|Luckily my copy is from the Library. The beginning chapters were boring and I read less and less each night, wondering how many mean spirited people is she going to throw at the reader. Not only mean spirited but totally UNINTERESTING! How truly boring the same lines became, chapter after yet another 'opening' chapter.  I read on trying to find the story.  As this is  JKR, I kept at it, wondering how many nights will I continue until I find something to capture the imagination. After a week,  I admit to speed reading whole chapters finding them sordid and not conducive to late night reading. Not that all books have to be uplifting, but the banality of the characters gave no insights, no compassion is evoked by the miserable lot of them. I tried to pick up later in the book, looking for a crumb that would inspire thoughtfulness and inspire me to quit this skimming.  ( I was already well into the book before this search for meaning, I finally read the last 3 chapters) Today I discovered that Amazon reviews, in the majority, agree with One Star, and I can quit plodding through trying to find the \\"There\\" there in story. Being a fan of Dostoyevsky I can take multiple characters and depressing subject matter. But not this book's drivel. Don't waste your money! Check it out of the library first.... you could disagree, but just in case.

B004EPYZU8|1.0|I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start on a high note. Visually, it's great. Very nice visuals, lots of stuff I would normally like, swords, samurai, dragons, robots, steampunk nazis. It all sounds great right? Well the greatness ends there. Everything else about this movie is terrible. The acting, if you want to call it that, is atrocious. The plot is kind of like Inception if a far less intelligent individual wrote it with multiple layers of reality and whatnot. I was really excited to see this movie because even though it looked crazy, I thought, \\"Snyder will pull it all together to make an awesome movie!\\". NOPE! It's a huge almost incoherent mess. There's just enough there to keep the story intact.<br /><br />Short version,<br />Pros: Nice visuals, kind of original<br />Cons: Everything else

B00926J3K6|5.0|To most rock music aficionados King Crimson is best known for their early work, with grand melodic pieces like `In the Court of the Crimson King' and `In the Wake of Poseidon' characterized by Peter Sinfield's slightly pretentious-sounding lyrics belted out faultlessly by singer Greg Lake over orchestral-sounding mellotrons.<br /><br />However, Crimson was Robert Fripp's band and he was never a man to allow the grass to grow under his feet. The band changed and developed under Fripp's direction through at least three incarnations into a very different animal. LTIA was the first demonstration that the 1972-reinvented King Crimson (following the departure of Sinfield and the demise of the `Islands' line-up in April that year) was something special: the herald of great things to come from a new core trio of Fripp, drummer Bill Bruford - who quit a lucrative career with Yes to join - and Fripp's old friend, bass player John Wetton. Violinist/keyboard player David Cross and multi-percussionist Jamie Muir completed the party to give this album a unique line-up. Muir left shortly after the release of LTIA but his compositional talent brings a distinctive flavour here missing from the new band's subsequent outings like `Starless and Bible Black' and `Red' - great though they are in their own right.<br /><br />The music of LTIA is new, the only exception being `Exiles' whose anthem-style reprises the sound of the first-generation Crimson. The band is tight, musically inventive, bursts with energy and is underpinned with the defining characteristic of true professionals: a marked degree of discipline and restraint. Powerful instrumental pieces outnumber `songs' though we find songs here too, like `Easy Money' and the smooth ballad `Book of Saturday'. The album has a `dark' flavour in the same way Miles Davis' music from this period is often described, i.e. non-frivolous, full of power, earnest-bordering-obsessive and with minor keys dominant: not `easy listening' or `ambient', no sir. There is however compositional brilliance, musical light and shade with great loud/quiet dynamics and surprises throughout; you never know what's coming next and the more you listen, the more you appreciate its hidden depths. If you like great, adventurous music and especially what might loosely be described as the jazz-rock fusion style, the best advice is: just listen to this and prepare to be blown away.<br /><br />On the 2012 40th Anniversary re-issue, sound wizard Steven Wilson has performed some kind of miracle: probably the most remarkable improvement in sound ever achieved from original analogue recording tapes, bringing out the dynamics of the different instruments - especially the bass and percussion - to such effect you almost feel the band is playing live in the room with you. The result puts previous releases of LTIA, good though they were, in the shade so if in doubt about which to buy, Wilson's outstanding 2012 remix is the only contender. The offering also contains extra material and fine alternate versions of some of the core numbers.<br /><br />The DVD in the package is worth having too, with some live footage of the band in action in 1973 as one of the `extras' and some sharp 5.1 remixes on the sound-only part of the DVD.<br /><br />BTW the album's title caused some puzzlement in the music press on its 1973 release. Larks' tongues in aspic is one of the rarest, most exotic and peculiar dishes in the gastronomic world, appreciated by only a few connoisseurs who seek out its unique and delectable combination of flavours. Larks are the birds reputed to sing the sweetest, their tongues endowed with special qualities. Get it?, no sir.

0425263916|2.0|But that's not saying much. Again, it's just a modified 50 Shades book. At least the 2nd book in the series has some character development (which is why I gave it 2 stars over the 1 of the first book).

The &#34;x-ray&#34; like view of exactly how the bad guys die, what bones broken and organs destroyed is a unique touch and adds a slightly clinical element to the action.

B00926J3K6|5.0|NOTE: THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE NOVEMBER 2012 15-DISC 40th ANNIVERSARY BOXED SET OF LARKS' TONGUES IN ASPIC<br /><br />I was skeptical at first about buying this 15-disc set, and at this writing I'm still working my way through it, having surprised myself by purchasing it at a local retailer who was wise (or foolhardy?) enough to order it as a stock item. LARKS' TONGUES IN ASPIC was an important King Crimson recording, and not just for the band itself, but it just misses being as iconic as the original group's debut, IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING (and I did, indeed, buy that gargantuan box, and was eminently satisfied with it). But this set does do right by the album and the music, just the same, even if it doesn't demand quite the same degree of fixation for as many people (Note: IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING was a stunner of a record in the summer and fall of 1969, and for years after -- as one can attest from experience, if it really got to the listener without scaring them off, it left one kind of \\"whited out\\" mentally, the equivalent to what happens to astronaut Dave Bowman's eyes at the end of the \\"star-gate sequence\\" in 2001: A Space Odyssey -- getting back to the topic at hand, LARKS' TONGUES IN ASPIC has similar impact, and is even more daring and ambitious, but it also came out in a different environment, a little later and with a lot more competition in the field and, most importantly, AFTER Robert Fripp and King Crimson and everything they'd helped kick-start in 1969 had already taken place [including several fine, if not as bold or well-focused Crimson albums], though it was, indeed, head-and-shoulders above most of it. Hence, my initial resistance to its obvious allure, and skepticism).<br /><br />The remasterings/remixes of the studio material are awe-inspiring in their clarity, no argument there -- but most of the key parts of that are available on the more modest two-disc anniversary edition. What makes this box stand out, apart from the handsome packaging, is the inclusion of all of the live material of this version of the band from 1972/73 -- mostly from bootleg sources (and much, if not all of it, previously available as separate CDs from Robert Fripp's own on-line outlet) -- this is total immersion, or as total as it's ever likely to be, in this version of King Crimson. And then there are the studio rehearsals and early run-throughs which, for true fans of this record and this band, all combine to tell a story of how a record and a sound were built, as well as the construction of the foundation for what became the STARLESS AND BIBLE BLACK album that followed LARKS' TONGUES. In other words, this is roughly the equivalent, in terms of this version of King Crimson, what the super-deluxe IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING was for that edition of the band.<br /><br />And this reviewer found the list of shows on the box, holding it there in my hand, quite overpowering -- it was like that scene in The Manchurian Candidate where Sinatra starts to trigger Laurence Harvey's post-hypnotic programming using individual red queens in a game of solitaire and then confronts him with a whole deck, 52 red queens. . . .  Anyway, the restoration work on the live material makes it all worthwhile in this listener's book -- despite some harshness and imperfections, it's all more listenable than it seemed back in the 1970s when these tapes were first circulated. And one can hear, from their very first public performance, just how substantial and inventive a band this was, and how they worked out the finer points of the repertory that became the album at hand. The concert material is not state-of-the-art sound or anywhere near it, but it gives us what we need to hear, and no one is going to feel cheated -- there are a lot of lesser bands that one wishes would assemble chronicles of their sound like this.<br /><br />Recommendation to all fans who can afford it: Plunge in -- head first -- and see how long you can stay under. You'll love it -- moment by moment all of these beautiful musical nuances just appear, spontaneously, off the stage and out of the five personalities, and we get to hear how this version of the band evolved virtually from day-one. Every album of significance should only get this kind of treatment.
B007THA4FI|1.0|i read 4 chapters and wonder why i spent 14.99. it has alot of f--- word and taking our Lords name in vain. also i think you should be a  professor to read it, i enjoy reading but this is a no no.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|After listening to this record, it's her  most safest work she has ever done by far. I wasn't too fascinated. In fact, I felt bored with most of the songs. Many of its uptempos didn't kept me on my feet like the ones on Bionic apart from Your Body, Shut Up, and Around The World. It felt like the fun and excitement were missing. I would say that Blank Page and Sing For Me easily outshine most of the tracks on Lotus.  I would place Lotus behind B2B, Bionic, and Stripped because I feel that it does sound a bit generic compared to the more experimental sounds on the predecessors.<br /><br />Do I think that Lotus is an improvement on Bionic? Heck no..not really.  I like how Bionic was less commercialized, very artistic, and experimental. Bionic sounded at least more distinctive and more inviting in sound. Sonically, it's far more interesting and fun than Lotus. It had alot more variety in sounds while Lotus sounds like something that could easily be done by Rihanna, Katy, or Britney. People think Lotus is better than Bionic. If generic music is their kind of thing, then ok. But people who have been following her since Stripped and with REAL musical tastes knows she could have done a LOT better than this and not playing it safe. I can't really say that Lotus is more cohesive because most of the tracks left me more to be desired. I wanted to get into the songs, but the beats just didn't feel all that mind blowing to me. None of the songs truly gave me that wow factor like her older albums. None of the songs even compare to AMAZING, stellar songs like Monday Morning or Bobblehead. Bobblehead is one of those tracks that make me want to do hopscotch or double dutch. Christina needs to leave that generic mess to the younger crowd and return to the formula that made her stand APART from the rest. It feels like Christina's input and vision have been considerably absent on this one. It feels it's been greatly compromised for the sake of staying relevant and current.  it's really sad that people would rather praise her most generic work (Lotus) than the more artistic, riskier one (Bionic) that sets itself apart from the rest. Of course, commercialism always sell more and gets more rave reviews.  I find it so ridiculous that it's even got a higher score on Stripped on metacritic. The reviewers were spot on that people would like the mix and style of Stripped and Bionic won't be turning heards with this one. I couldn't believe that Lotus actually got a higher score than Stripped and Bionic. Lotus is by far her most safest, generic work and it gets more praised. I find it to be her weakest effort. It really frustrates me how Bionic never got the success it deserves and less praises. It's her most riskiest work ever and nobody wants to salute her for that. For being unique and different.Love u, Xtina. But your creativity is slipping. I want Riskytina BACK! The one who was not afraid to experiment. Show me that freak side like you did on Bionic! And I miss her interludes. It made her stand out more from the rest. Like this person said, \\"Say what you want about Bionic, the album had a powerful theme and overall vision both in her artwork and music, there was a connection and overall vibe. That is really missing from Lotus. It's like her artistry has been toned down by her people to help her sell but its just made it lacking.There's no interludes on this album which is classic Christina musically, there's no REAL or strong sense of musical themes because her label must have requested she go back to a safe formulas to sell. It's a random mix that does not work for me. There's no change of genre or change of image. I expected a very sensual and spiritual album, like the cover suggests \\"  Team Bionic ALL THE WAY!<br /><br />I know I am being very critical and harsh, but I strongly feel that Christina is WAAAY better than this. She doesn't need to resort to this. I'm an Aquarius. I can't help it if I like something more unique and different from the rest. I know her self-worth and the wonderful, great artist that she's truly is. I am feel really disappointed with this era. It's a total setback from the true artist she had aspired to be from Stripped. Like another reviewer had mentioned, she promised her fans that would never do safe/mainstream music. My...have the tables have turned. Hopefully, she makes it up to her devoted fans that were fans of her earlier work and returns to her OLD self. Because honestly this does not feel like a Christina album. The REAL Christina wouldn't resort to generic dance music and work with used up producers.  Overall, I would give Lotus 4/5. I still think it's worth listening, just not worth remembering. Even though I haven't felt compelled to put this album on repeat like her earlier ones, I will still get Lotus though...just to support Christina and her sales. I have to admit that the cover and images in the booklet are very beautiful and subtle. It had some nice themes like self defense and keeping positive vibes, just wish the music itself live up to my expectations. I guess this is her own \\"Charmbracelet\\".<br /><br />1. Lotus- Probably the most experimental and unique track on the entire album.  One person mentioned that her vocals on this track are soft and heavenly and, like the Lotus Flower, this song slowing grows and eventually blooms. I couldn't agree more. Best intro since Stripped!  5/5<br /><br />2. Army of Me- Wasn't really that crazy about this song at first. The sound is a little bland for my taste,  but it may be a nice follow up to Your Body. She makes references from her older song Fighter. \\"One of me is wiser, one of me is stronger, one of me is a fighter\\"  This song may grow on you.  4/5<br /><br />3. Red Hot Kinda Love- Sounds like a reject from Bionic. It's good, but I would probably have put this as a bonus track. 4/5<br /><br />4.  Make The World Move- I was really disappointed with this one when I heard it initially. I was ready to dismiss it as her weakest track on here, but it grew on me the more I listen to it. It can be a bit bland at times. Their other collaboration \\"Nasty\\" would have been a better choice for this album.  4.5/5<br /><br />5. Your Body- Honestly, it starts to get better with this. Perhaps, the most strongest, catchiest one on this album.  I love her body, just not this album. The lyrics will make you want to hit that repeat button each time!  5/5<br /><br />6. Let There Be Love- My mind screamed \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" as the song begins to start. Very generic, but it sounds radio friendly. 4/5<br /><br />7. Sing For Me- The first ballad on the album.  Now she is really starting to grab my attention here.Things start to get mellow.Pretty empowering song. Love the 80s throwback.  This would make a nice single choice.  5/5<br /><br />8. Blank Page- feels like You Lost Me pt. 2 with more strength. I could imagine this song being used on So You Think You Can Dance or being sung on shows like American Idol or The X Factor. 5/5<br /><br />9. Cease Fire- The drum beats are the only ones that give this song its own saving grace, other than that it can feel boring at times. She sounds bored.  People say this song reminds them of Rihanna, but I don't hear it. 4/5<br /><br />10. Around the World- I can picture Rihanna doing this song as well. Those were my immediate thoughts. This would also make a good single choice. If only they were more uptempos on this record that could sound this good as this one, but unfortunately only this song and Your Body caught my ears.  5/5<br /><br />11. Circles-The fiestiest track of them all. It clearly goes out to her haters that won't back off.  5/5<br /><br />12. Best Of Me- Have some good moments, but wish it could have been better. 4/5<br /><br />13. Just A Fool-the only non-generic song on the album. Nice to see Christina dabbling into country. This will comfort any doubters who were a bit hesitant of her doing this kind of thing. I love how Christina can pull off any genre. 5/5<br /><br />14. Light Up The Sky-Not my favorite, but it sounds very pleasant. 4/5<br /><br />15. Empty Words- Decent song. Like it better than Light Up the Sky. 4/5<br /><br />16. Shut Up-My favorite bonus track. I would add this song to the standard edition to spice things up cuz honestly this album feels boring. 5/5<br /><br />I won't bother giving the remix a rating.listen to it. It can be a bit bland at times. Their other collaboration \\"Nasty\\" would have been a better choice for this album.  4.5/5    5. Your Body- Honestly, it starts to get better with this. Perhaps, the most strongest, catchiest one on this album.  I love her body, just not this album. The lyrics will make you want to hit that repeat button each time!  5/5    6. Let There Be Love- My mind screamed \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" as the song begins to start. Very generic, but it sounds radio friendly. 4/5    7. Sing For Me- The first ballad on the album.  Now she is really starting to grab my attention here.Things start to get mellow.Pretty empowering song. Love the 80s throwback.  This would make a nice single choice.  5/5    8. Blank Page- feels like You Lost Me pt. 2 with more strength. I could imagine this song being used on So You Think You Can Dance or being sung on shows like American Idol or The X Factor. 5/5    9. Cease Fire- The drum beats are the only ones that give this song its own saving grace, other than that it can feel boring at times. She sounds bored.  People say this song reminds them of Rihanna, but I don't hear it. 4/5    10. Around the World- I can picture Rihanna doing this song as well. Those were my immediate thoughts. This would also make a good single choice. If only they were more uptempos on this record that could sound this good as this one, but unfortunately only this song and Your Body caught my ears.  5/5    11. Circles-The fiestiest track of them all. It clearly goes out to her haters that won't back off.  5/5    12. Best Of Me- Have some good moments, but wish it could have been better. 4/5    13. Just A Fool-the only non-generic song on the album. Nice to see Christina dabbling into country. This will comfort any doubters who were a bit hesitant of her doing this kind of thing. I love how Christina can pull off any genre. 5/5    14. Light Up The Sky-Not my favorite, but it sounds very pleasant. 4/5    15. Empty Words- Decent song. Like itbetter than Light Up the Sky. 4/5    16. Shut Up-My favorite bonus track. I would add this song to the standard edition to spice things up cuz honestly this album feels boring. 5/5    I won't bother giving the remix a rating.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I highly recommend this series. I was a true skeptic with all the mainstream hype surrounding these novels. The truth is, I truly enjoyed them.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was very detailed and at times a bit redundant. The fact is that this was written by a SEAL and not a full time author. Loved that the record was finally set straight from someone on the ground and not told by a politically driven view.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone interested in knowing more about the mission or SEALs overall.
B0090YHSFC|2.0|Lots of waiting for the critters to group together,  early power up to slow things down is of no help if during the slow period they still don't move to where making a slice makes sense.  Permissions not awful,  and given what they are today,  I don't see how the invasive adware activity described in another review could have happened.<br />But proper permissions is not something to rave over - -  it's to be expected.  Bad perms send a great game to the 1 star bin,  but ok perms do not make a boring game worth playing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book as I did the 1st and 3rd books. I have not read any romance novels in a long time, but my curiosity got the best of me due to the book's promotional ads.<br />It was totally unexpected but I was addicted and had to read all three.<br />I hope e.l.james writes another.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I feel strengthened after listening to this album.  The music leads you emotionally through the ups and downs of life, while giving so much inspiration and encouragement.  The last two songs perfectly cap it off, knowing you are not alone and feeling victorious on this journey of life.  The selection of songs and their sequence is perfect, making it a complete and uplifting experience.  Susan sings beautifully through each track and has amazing duets with both Crawford and Osmond.  This is her best album to date, in my opinion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so fun if you do not like easy levels then you can go on a harder level
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Always there when i need it. I just wish that it wouldn't make me update it all of the time.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I really wanted to love \\"Lincoln.\\" I was hoping for a biopic that would be both intimate and spectacular. I wanted the film to sweep me away and bring me close to an historical figure in the way that \\"A Man for All Seasons\\" allowed audiences to feel close to Sir Thomas More, or \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" created an unforgettable impression of T. E. Lawrence. I was hoping at least for a film as good as John Ford's \\"Young Mr. Lincoln.\\"<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" felt more like an educational docudrama than a gripping feature film. Daniel Day-Lewis, though, gives a commanding performance as Lincoln. You should see the film. It is good. It's just not anywhere near good enough.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that Steven Spielberg, one of the most successful and influential Hollywood directors of all time, could have made a film so plodding and wooden. Scriptwriter Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer-prize winner. I would have to guess that Mr. Kushner did not win that prize for crafting gripping, dramatic scripts charged with dramatic tension and driven by character-revealing plot.<br /><br />The film is entitled \\"Lincoln\\" but it would be more aptly titled \\"The Passing of the 13th Amendment Outlawing Slavery.\\" This shift of focus may have been done to make the film \\"relevant.\\"<br /><br />It's a high school English class truism that the main character of a story is the one who changes. Abraham Lincoln does not change in this film. In many scenes, he feels like a statue in the corner. Lincoln deputizes WN Bilbo (James Spader) to hustle up the necessary votes. Spader is terrific as Bilbo, and he almost steals the movie. It's Bilbo who is moving and shaking. Lincoln just hangs back and comes out with a quip or bon mot or folksy, homespun tale or spooky prophetic dream every now and then. Heck, the animatronic Lincoln at Disneyland could do everything that Spielberg and Kushner allow their Lincoln to do.<br /><br />Sally Field is too old to play Mary Todd Lincoln, who was in her forties at the time, with a young son. In her every scene, all I kept thinking was, \\"So, how is Sally Field doing as Mary Todd Lincoln?\\" I was never able to forget that it was Field I was looking at, never able to escape the fact that I was watching a film rather than being immersed in a story.<br /><br />Many of the actors seem to have a hard time delivering Kushner's lengthy sentences. There is a scene where Mary Todd Lincoln is, in a long-winded manner, telling off Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) at a formal dinner, and it is so stiff it feels like a high school production. Daniel Day-Lewis never has this problem with the dialogue.<br /><br />David Strathairn is terrific as William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state. He and DDL are utterly convincing in their scenes together. You really get a sense that these are two political partners with differing styles who are struggling as best they can toward a common goal - ending slavery. At one point Lincoln grievously disappoints Seward, and he dismisses Seward by remarking, \\"Time is a great thickener of things.\\" Seward's response is priceless. The movie comes to life at that moment. It is depicting a vital but trouble relationship, how that relationship vents its anger, how it heals its wounds, how it struggles onward toward a hoped-for goal. If more time had been devoted to Lincoln and Seward's relationship, \\"Lincoln\\" would have been a better film.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones delivers the biting insults of Thaddeus Stevens, Pennsylvania congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. Stevens' insults, and his ridiculous wig, and Tommy Lee Jones' persona and voice, are so striking that Stevens almost becomes a caricature. He bellows that another house member is a reptile too low to step upon. The film doesn't get beyond that. It doesn't bring us into the mind of a white man courageous enough to battle slavery. There is a great, brave, brief scene where Lincoln and Stevens speak face-to-face andone-on-one. Stevens talks about his contempt for the common man. How could such a contemptuous person fight for human dignity? It's a conundrum the film doesn't plumb. Lincoln responds to Stevens with a terrific metaphor about compasses and swamps. Again, if there had been more of this kind of intelligent, challenging, and focused dialogue, this would have been a better film.<br /><br />My major disappointment with this film is that it didn't bring me any closer to Lincoln. There is something about Lincoln that defies the limitations of his time and place, and, therefore, understanding of him. He is truly larger than life. In the many photos of him, we see a compelling but inaccessible man. His features, with their marked facial asymmetry, grip and confound us - they invite, and resist, intimacy. He married a woman rumored to be mad. He was rumored to be a homosexual. He was martyred on Good Friday and it is said he haunts the White House. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance made me feel close to Lincoln, but the plot and direction didn't support that. I left disappointed.<br /><br />The production values are lavish. Scenes are chock-a-block with authentic, accurate, books, costumes, boot buckles, mustache combs, clay jugs, corsets, wallpaper. You almost get a whiff of the stale air of a museum. I look forward to watching the extra-feature-packed DVD that will include a chart with little arrows pointing to each object and offering its provenance, age, and construction materials.one-on-one.

B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game.  My 4 year old son is addicted too.  It's similar to the &#34;Where's My Water&#34; app.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|love it.  The color and price were exactly what  I was looking for.  I would recommend to anyone who needs a cover.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix from the Sing-off is amazing in this album. I usually don't listen to Christmas music, but this album blew my Christmas socks off. Each of the members of the group are truly talented! This is a must buy for the collection! don't even hesitate

1469984202|5.0|This Wool series has captured me at the start.  I was anxious to read something new, different and unpredictable for a change.  I was not disappointed!  Each new book in the series I am counting the days to be able to purchase, clear my schedule for reading and absorb myself in the story.<br /><br />If you are tired of the same ole same ole, this is it.  I do not want to go into detail because I wouldn't want to slip any spoilers and ruin it for you.<br /><br />Trust me, you won't regret purchasing this book.  This series has my attention to take the time to place a review.  The author has done a wonderful, creative writing with his Wool series.  If I could give 10 stars, I would easily.<br />[[ASIN:1469984202 Wool - Omnibus Edition]]

B006AZZPCM|5.0|tube mate just works! I combine this with shazam to get all the latest music on the radio! definitely worth downloading
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I think this book was a great read and couldn't put it down! The author is an amazing writer and always keeps you guessing and always makes it suspenseful. what i really like about this book is the fact that the ending isn't obvious and you're never really sure whats going to happen next.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This is the most shallow poorly written book and I think it is not Grishams work. Now if it is his then it is time for him to quit, I have read all his previous books and have always enjoyed them but this is crap, he must know how sub-standard this is<br />and I feel that I have been ripped off, come on now who wrote this piece of garbage ? and is he going to refund my money ?

0812993292|4.0|I was interested in this book, because I have been one some pilgrimages myself, in Spain and France. I must admid that these have been more of the secular sort. I expected this book to be a pilgrimage in Britain, and with stories of what Harold Fry met on his walk.  The book contains such stories as well as a story of HF's life, and the story of his somewhat miserable life together with his wife, Maureen. However, the story is not miserable all together, it also contains humoristic parts. His pilgrimage is definetely secular, but the strory is both touching and very well written. And for me, a foreigner, and English not my mother tongue, it is very British!  I loved reading it, and have already lent it to a friend, who has also been in my group on pilgrimages.

B006C67NP6|5.0|This app has already proved useful for Jazz rehearsals and individual practice. The built in band with different style options and tempos is extremely convenient for practicing soloing. The chord sheet style view shows up very well on my HTC 1. The forums are great for tech support and hold a wealth of CHORD sheets to thousands of familiar songs. A day has not gone by that I have not used this app in some shape or form. Just finished a Christmas music rehearsal with it too. Great Product. Thanks

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had the original Kindle and loved it from the time I bought it.  I could take my books (plural) with me when just about anywhere.  Then, THEN, the Kindle for Android app came out.  It's, as I said in the title, simply the best thing to ever happen to reading.  I gave my Kindle to my another avid reader.  I just loooooove the Kindle for Android!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I won't say it's a lot of fun. It's just strangely addictive. I played all the way through to being level 100 befoe I had to delete it for wasting so much of my time. Look up Skinner Boxes if you want to understand why it's so catchy.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Seldom have I laughed that hard while watching a film (yeah - a movie). Perfect illusions; bombastic story; exactly what we need in these dire days.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|One of the best movies there is!. Has lots of good behind the scenes in this Blue-Ray/DVD set. Would recommend.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Overwhelming viewing experience; idiotic story; nice action; has not much to do with the Nordish sagas, but was fun to watch (only once, and now the DVD is in my file cabinet.)
1936608618|5.0|This book is a very comprehensive source for endurance athletes that want to train efficiently. Brian has included so many pictures and details in a very clear presentation. I recommend that all endurance athletes have this in their library as a great reference for technique and conditioning. This book has much to offer athletes at every level.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app.  It's great for just sitting at home and wanting to try a few ideas that are cute and creative.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I'm not thrilled that I spent $5 to get about a third of what I paid $1 for a few months ago (AB Seasons) ... but the game is pretty decent. It's Angry Birds and Star Wars, and the mix is done VERY well.<br /><br />What I like: The new birds and sound effects are fantastic.<br /><br />Dont like: Price. Hopefully I've bought the FULL game now (paid for the Jedi levels), and they won't try to sock me for more money when extra levels are released. And I don't think I'm a fan of the HD high resolution. I like seeing where my birds are going, so zoom out to view the entire screen, which makes things very very tiny even on my 7\\" tablet. This wasn't much of a problem in the first three Angry Birds games, but started to be prevalent in the AB Space version.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series is fascinating!  His books are well written.  They follow along from one to the other very cohesively. If you like to escape into a good book these are the best!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you liked the first two books in the series, you will like this one.  The story concluded nicely and tied up all loose ends.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is Minecraft. Except I can take it with me. This app is great. I have found more diamonds in this than I have in PC edition. Great game!
1576875776|5.0|This book is amazing! The size is perfect, the photos are well printed. When you discover Vivian Maier's work, yo are gonna fall in love with her. I recommend!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this for my six year old grandson, the world's greatest Avengers fan.  He was more than delighted.  According to his mother, he couldn't wait for &#34;movie night&#34; (in his house that's every Friday) to begin.  He has already watched the movie a dozen times.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game! I like how you can get prizes and get the coins. It is hard to ware until you get more coins.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed this story.  Incredible photographs turned into a delightful read.  I hope the author considers writing a second book to continue the journey.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is an excellent battery monitoring app! I love that it gives you an estimated amount of time that the battery will last for different functions of my kindle fire.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not a Stephan King reader but  saw this in the best sellers and was recommended to me in an email,  I read the review and went for it.  It hooked me from the start.  Great story and very well told!

B007HACDLK|5.0|Another excellent book from Vince Flynn. Loved it. Read it in one day. Cannot wait for the next one. Flynn can be counted on to keep me turning the pages.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I was very pleased with the limited permissions this app requires. This is a great developer! The game itself is a fun variation on area capture games. The sound is a bit annoying, buy that's my only complaint. Don't feel it's worth $2 but great FAOTD!
B004QHR5GA|5.0|Listening to Alex Turner is like sipping champaign on the beach while watching the sun go down.  A must have if you are fan of the Arctic Monkeys.
B007L24T52|4.0|Unput downable book from start to finish. Baldacci is the master story teller. This could happen to any person what a finish.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not fond of gruesome stories that involve children killing each other, but this was a good read. I might read the rest of them.
0525953728|5.0|I loved this book.  It tell the truth about the death and all the things that happened to prepare for the mission.  How the SEALs handled the whole thing how the president failed them in allowing the press to see inside the situation as he WANTED it seen.
B001Q2ZHZE|5.0|This movie is amazing.  Watch the director's cut if you want to do it justice.  Scary on a horrifying metaphysical level, incredibly romantic, heartbreakingly sad, and did I MENTION underrated?  It's completely unfair to Ashton Kutchner that no one gives him credit for this--though the actor who plays his younger self really carries the movie.  Director's cut!  That's absolutely vital--the theatrical release is positively castrated, and that's exactly the word for it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I'm still reading and think it's very good - much more detail that the TV Series ( which I also enjoyed ). I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read set in medieval times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end could be no other way. An intense amount of emotions come out in this book. I recommend this and the other two books in the trilogy to everyone who likes to read well written books with memorable characters.
B0086700CM|4.0|Good overall product. A lot of fun and very addicting. Can be a little glitchy sometimes and isn't convenient to play all the time. For example, if you are in a moving vehicle or just want to play for a few minutes.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Based on this I am now transforming my presentations. It is amasing way of doing it and helps a lot.
1451695195|5.0|\\"Proof of Heaven\\" is a fascinating account of an experience by a highly trained and experienced neurosurgeon , following an extremely serious near-death experience. The author's detailed account of his own medical condition provides highly significant support to his account. The description of the after-life experiences may be at variance with the beliefs of many but they are still well worth consideratiion and I highly recommend Dr Alexander's account for all readers!
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I loved this book so much. It is easily now one of my favorite books of all time. Patti smiths retelling of how she met Robert Mapplethorpe and their time at the chelsea hotel was inspiring and made me want to create art.

B004EWFUQY|5.0|It's easy reading. I am post op breast cancer reconstruction by 2 days and a mastectomy 1 year ago. These meal plans and phases are great. I also have  Celiacs disease and its great for that also, for its no or low carbs. Great meal planner & It's a diet plan any one can stick to. The recipe's are great and easy to follow too. thank you so much Dr. Dukan for releasing your book to the States and of course in English lol.
1400109841|5.0|You hear so much about NK and most of it has some type of political slant to it.  Much of it is sensationalized also.  This book really does give you a good idea what these people go through on a daily basis.  Also to note, it spans many many years of these people's lives, from the time they are young until they finally get out and even after showing how they had to adjust to their new found freedoms.  It's far more than just a snapshot.
B00884GR0W|5.0|At first I didn't like it, but then I thought to myself : THIS ISNT MINECRAFT! So then I played for days and months!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It began a little slower in my opinion, however if you like the first one, you have to read the whole series. It's amazing!
0385535147|2.0|As with most of Grisham's books, this one started out very nicely.  And then came the middle. And mercifully then came the end.  I was disappointed with the book because it plodded and it was very unrealistic.  I realize it's fiction, but I didn't know it was science fiction.  Overall, this was just not very good.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The different points of views that are given in this book are amazing. All of the characters have different life styles, but they're all connected by one thing. Time.
B007704HO6|5.0|Brilliant read heart warming goes to show how important cats are in life and hoe loyal and clever they really are.
B0058O84G0|4.0|this book takes you to journey of period 1911 to 1919 .<br />the social condition and behaviour of rich and poor during that period.<br />fast pace story and well packed incidents with world war-i in reference helps you understand the demography of that period.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|You may like the story line or not but what shines about this 3D video is the imagination of those who crafted it. Avatar is entertaining on so many levels that it is hard to miss by purchasing this one.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Hands down great movie. One of Anderson's best. Would recommend it to anyone, including a family night movie. Everyone will enjoy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this app! it does take up a good deal of space on my kindle however. It's a good source of entertainment if you are bored. I just wish the timers filled up faster.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very entertaining and challenging!!  I would recommend this game for anyone who needs a new game to entertain them!
0865479410|5.0|I read a lot of books.  I really like books and since I choose them fairly carefully I generally enjoy to some degree most of the books I read.  This book is really well done.  The longer I read it the more I liked it.  There is no guide to happiness to be found in this book as much as a lot of thoughtful analysis of what is wrong with the approach most people take and some very good discussion on what might be a better approach.<br /><br />The author is an engaging writer and doesn't take himself too seriously, but he approaches the subject seriously.  The main idea is that embracing negative thoughts, uncertainty, insecurity, etc. is a better approach to happiness than positive thinking.  The author doesn't really define happiness but you get the point.<br /><br />This is not a light and breezy read but it is not difficult either.  You will benefit to the extent you think deeply while reading it.  I loved it.<br /><br />You can see the chapters and preview text by taking advantage of Amazon's \\"Search Inside\\" feature which this book has.  I highly recommend this thoughtful and well-written work.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Brilliant buy as complete edition two in one book 5.<br />George RR Martin has captured the excellence of written imagery as the characters of the seven kingdoms fight it out its a cant put down edition full of twists and turns and excitement as they play to win cant wait for The Winds of Winter

B004T4KQJS|5.0|His treatise opens a whole new idea of our strange universe. \\"Nothing is unstable\\" says it all. The Dark Matter and Dark energy is a mystery we still need to unravel.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Lift this blade and feel the heft, look upon the broad back, full tang, hardy grips, and know this is a formidable blade, of modest length, designed to meet any contingency exceedingly well, whatever comes along. OTB, it comes sharp, and ready to cut, with a secure scabbard it will be there waiting to be called upon, a companion worthy to ride on our sides into the realm of discovery and adventure. This is gear that provides great Bang for the buck. The BK-2; a quality knife. I strongly recommend this knife to other purveyor's of the blade.
B005GET448|5.0|This book should be considered by everyone.it really made me think about what we are not getting right and that we all need to work in a different way.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|I was eager to read another story with John Cory and Kate Mayfield.  They  are great characters.  I hate to say,  the storyline was pretty predictable<br />and I wouldn't rate the story as highly as The Lion or Plum Island, to name two. Perhaps I was expecting too much of Demille.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|It's good to study Japanese with this and. if your hand hurt it can be comfortable so Give it a shot
B000YT3KEA|3.0|I was looking for storybooks with wonderful illustrations for my 4 year old, who happily listens to chapter books but wants to examine pictures while listening. The Narnia books were one of my favorite series growing up, so I thought I'd give this one a try. The pictures are definitely great. However, the text is horrible. The way the story is adapted makes it disjointed and makes the characters all sound, frankly, stupid. What I have done is to read my actual unabridged version to my son and have him look at the pictures in this book. I would recommend this if you're just looking for great pictures, but not otherwise.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Don't look for anything exciting, just simple, addictive fun that's good for all ages. Also good for teaching the concepts of physics, if not with complete accuracy.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Enjoying the book a lot. Wish I read years ago.Some parts I can actually feel I am there . Never attempted to read,because I felt it would be boring and hard to read
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Season 5 is no exception. Mad Men is one big momentum of our time.<br />Something we can't say about world distribution.<br />So season 5 is not broadcasted in France at this time, and no Blu-ray on sight.<br />Ordering it from the US is the only option to stay legit. Still we have to pay the hard price. Customs did stop this small package ( this is a really slim box with its 3 discs) and delayed the delivery for their almost usual racket of so called taxes. Something we did pay included in the US price tag, right ? And, Amazon, this package was some old yellow too soft envelop and not your usual standard small hardbox. The Blu-ray set arrived  unarmed but that was pure luck. And something in this bright yellow envelop did something to attract the unwelcomed customs people. Anyway, still waiting for a global official distribution of films around the world AT THE SAME TIME !

B004UID2LC|3.0|This product is interesting.  My only criticism is that the popup ads are tiresome and useless to me. This is a revision of my first review because my first review failed to meet Amazon standards for product reviews.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I purchased this \\"K\\" version of the Core i5 not because of its overclocking capabilities, but because of its integrated HD4000 graphics.  The graphics capabilities of this processor obviate the need for a seperate graphics card in the new computer I am building as my main \\"at home\\" computer.  It even handles video files well, including converting from one video file format to another to be displayed on different devices (transcoding).<br /><br />The performance of the HD4000 graphics depends on the CPU and memory which is why I chose the i5-3570K over the i3-3225 which also has HD4000 and costs a hundred dollars less. The Windows Experience Index for the 3D and gaming graphics of the i5-3570K in my system is 6.5, identical to the score of my old GeForce 8600 GTS video card.  The \\"desktop graphics\\" score is 5.9 (the lowest WEI score in my Windows 8 system).  These scores are for the Core i5-3570K used with a pair of 8 GB sticks of DDR23-1333 memory (I decided to go with the lowest-speed memory supported with my motherboard).  Faster memory would improve the performance of the processor's integrated graphics.<br /><br />I used the stock cooler that came with the it, but first I removed the thermal compound from it (wiping it off with 91 per cent isopropyl alcohol) and applied a centered rice-grain like drop of Arctic Cooling MX-4.<br /><br />When I installed Windows on my new computer the processor was at first terribly slow.  Investigating the problem I turned down the TV and restarted the computer and heard the familiar rat-a-tat-tat sound of a dangling cable touching the CPU fan in spite of the fact that my cables were organized carefully.  During final assembly of the Intel stock cooler the fan cable is wrapped around the fan by threading it through little clips built into the periphery of the fan; someone on the assemble line apparently missed and had some of the wires running around the inside of the fan (in contact with the blades).  I pulled the cable back to the outside of the fan where it belongs and then everything was fine.<br /><br />When you follow the instructions to mount the cooler over the CPU on the motherboard, it is important to press down on the four corner \\"buttons\\" so that the four black posts and their white holders all correctly protrude through the bottom of the motherboard.  In my case the computer case has a rectangular hole so that you can view the bottom of the motherboard to see the four places where the cooler is attached.  If one of the four posts has not been pressed down correctly then when you turn on the computer and check the temperature in the BIOS Setup you will see the temperature rise over a period of about five minutes to ninety-five degrees Celsius which is close to the boiling point of water (I tried it), but mounted properly the Core i5-3570K will more likely top out at around thirty-five degrees Celsius which is below human body temperature.<br /><br />If I was to play intensive video games I would probably have to replace the stock cooler with a third-party one and add a graphics card or two.  Otherwise, the Intel Core i5 3570K with its built-in HD4000 graphics has the features and performance that I need for a multiple-purpose computer that can work with various devices in the home and across the internet.<br /><br />A motherboard with an Intel 7-series chipset (Z77 or Q77, for example) is needed to take advantage of some features of this 3rd-generation processor including the integrated graphics.the outside of the fan where it belongs and then everything was fine.<br /><br />When you follow the instructions to mount the cooler over the CPU on the motherboard, it is important to press down on the four corner \\"buttons\\" so that the four black posts and their white holders all correctly protrude through the bottom of the motherboard.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has a reputation for taking historical situations, with real and fictional characters, (see Pillars of the Earth for example), and creating a fascinating and entertaining story. His books are educational, and a darn good read at the same time. Winter of the World is no exception. My only disappointment is that I have to wait until late 2013 for the third edition.
B008ENA74E|2.0|His writing skills are very average. Half of this book is explaining what derivitaves are and how they are figured. Very basic information, nothing juicy at all. He thinks very highly of himself and I would recommend many other books over this one. I regret purchasing it and might not even finish it
B009YU62H2|5.0|As a someone who was a teenager during the mid and late 90's Soundgarden's music was standard issue for me.  Chris Cornell's vocals voiced a frustration and sometimes sorrowful lament about the strange and confusing times that I was living in.  As a group Soundgarden was like a force of nature, the equivalent of a massive storm in intensity, more human than human and a force that refuses to be ignored.  I had Soundgarden in my pumping through my Sony Walkman getting me through Middle School and High School and then they were gone.  I followed Chris Cornell's solo career with enthusiasm and saw an incredible singer evolve from notable to exceptional.  But Soundgarden together is some more special than they are apart.  After 16 long years Soundgarden has come back to fill a place of prominence that I have kept vacant just in the hope that their return might one day come.  As I listened to \\"King Animal\\" I realized that Soundgarden must have always held on to the thread that binds them together, because it feels like there was no absence and that they kept evolving together even though they were apart.  The lyrics strike a deep chord just as they always have and the echoing guitars and deep booming bass and drums are still the perfect foil for Cornell's soulful and rich voice.  I listened to this album with a stupid grin on my face; it is the look of a person that believed in something and whose faith was proven to be justified.  As a teen I couldn't get through the day without the rhythmic guidance of Soundgarden and now I find them these many years later still moving me and guiding me.  A triumphant and long overdue return for a band that has meant so much to me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Highly recommend. Could not stop reading. I can't wait to see if a movie is made and who would play the characters
1450400957|5.0|I've been a gym rat for over 20yrs...most information out there is just repeated over & over in different ways & I find myself just using new books or magazines as a reminder or to keep my motivation up.  However, I keep looking back at the pages of this book because there is so much valuable information.  Even if you think you know it all, want to have a better game plan when you hit the gym, want to hear some real reason to what you've always heard was the right way & didn't know why or better yet, you need improvement (doesn't EVERYONE) please check this book out.  I found many little things I've been doing I was doing wrong or just a bit off but the information given in this book has helped me pull out of my plateau. My workouts have changed so has my body--all in a very short time & I owe it to this book.  It's great for men & women & a must for new & experienced strength training enthusiasts.
159420411X|4.0|First, this is the material that is missing from undergraduate stats textbooks: a critical analysis of the applications of statistics. While you do not need to know statistics to read this book, you should if you really want to walk away with new knowledge.<br /><br />The real point of this book is Silver contrasts Bayesian ideology with Frequentists approaches to forecasting. Bayes is not very well covered in undergrad stats texts. I remember the textbook I used in stats basically stuffed it in the conditional probability section as a few pages with little fanfare. And most books on Bayes seem targeted for the graduate level and don't offer a novice disscussion.<br /><br />The issues I have with this book are mostly directed at style of writing.  I found Silver's style hard to read at times. It read more like an academic paper translated afterward to be a mass market book for general readership.  Also the structure did not really work for me. Each concept goes from overview to specific to more specific to detailed.  well that is how it read to me personally, and it seemed redundant. Again this is my personal view on it, you may find the flow intuitive and easy to read.<br /><br />Overall a well researched book written by a brilliant person.
1451695187|5.0|Intriguing. Like to read peoples real life experience of the afterlife and beyond. This comes from a doctor and a former skeptic so more interesting to read and soak in as true accounts.
B002HWUU2C|5.0|This record is one of my all time favorites, but I bought it again for the bonus cd of the live music. The Swell Season are amazing live, and I highly recommend picking up the deluxe version. Haven't been able to watch the dvd yet, but I'm sure it's stellar as well.

1451627297|5.0|This is one of the best novel I have read in a long time. I'm even sad I finished it. This book is good from beginning to end. The end was beautiful written.<br /><br />So if you are looking for some action, thriller, sci-fi, romance and a bunch of drama ... this is your book. Stephen king does it again.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|The first obvious comment to make is that this film must inevitably be compared not only to the Le Carre novel but the television miniseries which preceded it by decades. As others have pointed out, the film suffers the inevitable disadvantage of trying to tell a complex, textured story in just two hours, while Le Carre had the relative luxury of hundreds of pages and the miniseries had six hours of narrative to work with. Be that as it may, the film succeeds in its story telling far better than one might have expected. The viewer's got to work for it, and I'm sure I had a huge advantage in having already read the book and watched the miniseries; still, it's pretty much all there, but in the cramming several elements were lost or distorted. The mission on which Jim Prideaux is wounded is changed significantly, probably for the sake of streamlining the plot, but so is the manner of the final revenge. That alteration at the end does provide for some effective counterpoint and again the saving of several minutes, but it's a less plausible payback than in the book and in its own way rather less satisfying to me. Other changes are less explicable -- why, for instance, the character of Peter Guillam was made gay in the film is beyond me. As for casting, I believe that Gary Oldman is marvelous. I don't think he's any better or worse than Alec Guinness was in the miniseries as George Smiley, just different. And his kind of different works exceptionally well. Other supporting players are quite well cast, but my main problem is with Colin Firth as Bill Haydon. To my mind, Ian Richardson patented that role in the miniseries, and Firth -- though an exceptional actor -- doesn't portray Haydon as well as the detached, ascetic Richardson did. Production values in this film are absolutely first-rate -- the sets capture the dingy workaday world of The Circus and its spies, operatives and bureaucrats, and John Hurt almost steals the film from Oldman in his short appearances as Control. But it remains Oldman's vehicle, and his version of Smiley controls this two hours with the same silent grip that Guinness' character had on the miniseries. Perhaps more so, actually. I'd love to give this film five stars, but the changes and distortions that I mentioned earlier, perhaps so necessary to cram this thing into two hours, make it less than perfect, and so I give it four. But be advised: If you haven't read the book or viewed the miniseries, I'm giving it three stars for you -- I suspect that a lot will be confusing your first time through. Be prepared to watch it several times; it might grow on you. Maybe.
0316228532|3.0|After reading \\"Harry Potter\\" I was disappointed in this \\"adult\\" book.  It was somewhat confusing and hard to keep all the characters in order.<br />I received it in very good condition.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|I have no reservations classifying this as a masterpiece.  Deftones have totally blown me away with this cd.  Absolutely brilliant mix of songs.  The compositions, lyrics, musicianship, and vocals all continue to progress, and have gelled into something that can stand up against any music created in the last quarter of a century.<br /><br />This is by far the most underrated band in existence today.....and they have produced a work of art that deserves critical acclaim on all levels.
1250004349|1.0|I desperately needed a book to read on a plane and fell for the gushing reviews of 'Sarah's Key'. The only redeeming factor of this drivel is the fascinating subject of the 'Vel d'Hiv Roundup,\\" and I'm interested in pursuing that topic further with a good non-fiction book. The writing, however, is laughable, and makes me sad to think that readers will, not only settle for, but praise this level of mediocrity. The story is formulaic and utterly predictable. The characters are so stock and one-dimensional they could be on a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch: The devastatingly handsome but emotionally distant, ever-so-French husband; the cold, snooty, ever-so-French family; the gay best friends; the bold, smart-ass sister. The protagonist of the modern day portion of this book is utterly dull and her obsession with Sarah is unpersuasive. I literally laughed out loud at some of the lines. There must be other authors who examine this subject matter without embarrassing themselves or the slavish reading public. Pick up something by David Mitchell, for example, and you'll see what real writing is.
B009FB3XTA|3.0|Ok, I admit it. I'm one of THOSE moms who really like the Twilight series. I am also a mom who has been really into music for the last 30 years, so the draw for all the Twilight soundtracks, for me, is more about the music than the Twilight phenomena. That being said, I really enjoyed all the other discs more than this one. I found myself wishing for a few more upbeat songs. There's a few on this disc that I have really enjoyed, most notable being the track with Paul McDonald and Nikki Reed (All I've Ever Needed). I also really like Iko's \\"Heart of Stone\\" and the remake of the \\"Thousand Years\\" by Christina Perri. Maybe the other songs will grow on me, but they certainly did not reach out and grab me like the previous discs have. AND my husband heard the Greenday song playing in the car and commented on how terrible it was. (And we really like people with unusual voices such as Tom Waites, Chuck Brodsky etc.)<br /><br />All in all I think it is worth it for the songs I really like, just wish it had been a stronger addition to the collection.
B007XH6BPG|4.0|i just wanted to clear some guys out here, i was just reading interview with the guys and they clearly say there its more of a rock album then prog album, so don't take it as a prog album and give it bad reviews just because it isnt the progfest you espected because its these two guys, good of them to do something different then everyone expects, gonna check this album out and then write a review here

The two main characters: Will and Lake worked so well together, and you can sense their chemistry from the moment they meet.<br />The use of the poetry within the book was an excellent way to know the characters.  The story was well written, and all the characters in the book are well developed. I just love this book!!!

B002A97IJ0|4.0|When I plugged this very thin fan in for the first time, it started a tornado in my room with all the dust before I could put my filter on.<br /><br />Just kidding, but this fan has incredibly great airflow for such a tiny thing. At 2000 RPM, it will whine pretty loudly, but it pushes more air than the 120x25 mm fans in my case at high speeds.<br />At first I plugged it into a voltage-regulated fan port (the only one on the motherboard) and it stayed at 2000 RPM until I plugged it into a PWM fan port. At that point it went down to 1200 RPM and got silent.<br />Ever since then it hasn't turned up at all and I can't even hear it.<br /><br />If you don't care about sound, I would get this 2000 RPM version. I would get it even if you don't for the sheer experience ever once in a while of turning it up.<br /><br />If you never want to hear a sound, get the 1200 RPM version and you'll be satisfied.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Non spoiler general review:<br /><br />I was taught in writing classes that there are 3 elements to any story; the character(s), the plot, and the place. In a short story, you can get away with sacrificing one of the 3, as you don't have time to flesh them all out. That's fine for a short story, but doesn't work in a 900+ page novel, let alone a series. But that's exactly what this book feels like, a criticism I see echoed in other reviews here. This is just a collection of short stories without a binding theme to hold them all together.<br /><br />Song of Ice and Fire has great characters, a lovely world, good writing....and no plot. There isn't even a main character. (Ask three people and you'll get three answers as to who the book is about) The writer's forward states this book is supposed to be taking place simultaneously with the events in [[ASIN:B007CK0Q6E A Feast for Crows]], but that's just a poor excuse for re-hashing the same crap with no direction. He fills in the gaps with tedious descriptions of women's breasts (the last book it was women's genitals, so I suppose that's an improvement), and casual but pointless violence. 1000 pages, and I think it covered about 24 hours worth of time. At the rate he's going, the HBO series (which is FAR better than the books) will have caught up to him and be delayed while he screws around inventing more minor characters while leaving the main players to hand out in limbo.<br /><br />Spoilers below:<br /><br />Sansa and Littlefinger do not appear anywhere. Bran has two chapters, and now he's a tree. Scratch another Stark off the list. Rickon is awol from the last book and this one. Who knows, are we even caring any longer? Cersei gets two lame chapters, and has been completely destroyed as a believable antagonist. Come to think of it, all the women suffer about 50 points of lost IQ, but at least I know what all their cup sizes and the colors of their nipples are. Jon, previously a candidate for main character, gets stabbed 4 times at the end of the book - IRL or a decent book he'd be a goner, but since Martin magically brought another Targaryen back to life as well as inventing a new subplot involving Varys, I'm not counting him out yet. Arya gets a measly 2-3 chapters. The rest of the book? New minor characters. Like 15 new characters.<br /><br />Do NOT waste your money on this garbage. Check it out from a library like I did.bed 4 times at the end of the book - IRL or a decent book he'd be a goner, but since Martin magically brought another Targaryen back to life as well as inventing a new subplot involving Varys, I'm not counting him out yet.

B005PV81MS|5.0|Gangbangers vs. aliens, with a British accent.  Pity the aliens.  Well-handled, well-acted chiller with London being pelted by fiery spaceballs that unfurl into black, furry creatures with huge, light blue, flouresecent teeth and a bad disposition.  The lightly armed gangbangers defend their housing project building, The Block, against a relentless attack.  For once, the ride is definitely worth the expense.  Buy the DVD; it's a keeper.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|There is no question that Angry Birds has honestly been the best game to download for every handheld device. Now, Angry Birds is trying their hands at Star Wars with the Angry Birds Star Wars. The game definitely handles well with the graphics, and the control is just as simple to play as the past Angry Birds games. Nevertheless, it doesn't tire down from the fun of the past Angry Birds games. While I did find Angry Birds Space to be a better game, it still delivers in on the fun. This is a definite must have for your handheld devices, Kindle Fire, and smartphones. If you have never even played an Angry Birds game, or are a huge fan of Star Wars, than this would be a absolutely nice place to start.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Control: B+<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
0486275590|4.0|I read this classic for book club and although the book club really didn't like it I found it kept my attention and was a nice short read.  I thought the dialogue was pretty impressive as compared with what a person would find in modern fiction.  Wish I had read it when I was younger since it would have caught more of my imaginations.  I wouldn't hesitate to give this to a young reader.
0345803493|5.0|This is the best erotic romance set I have read.  It was the fisrt erotic romance I had purchased.  After purchasing about a dozen erotic romance books after purchasing FSoG I feel this is the best on the market out of the ones I have read.  The story line is very believable, the book held my interest, the scenes were well described.  I can say that some of the scenes seemed repetitive though.  I definitely recommend this book/trilogy.

I have purchased 6 books of this kind since reading this trilogy and so far none of them compared.  This (for me) is the best erotic romance book I have read yet.<br />Update - After reading about a dozen more books of this type I still find Fifty Shades of Gray the best of them all.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|The writers are killing off all the original actors so fast before their characters are fully developed. Some of these zombies need to start starving off or rotting away. Fewer but faster and deadly walking dead that have tactics & work as a team in wolf pack instead of mass slow herds.

B004TTMYQG|2.0|This is a great calender app for phones and but not so good if you need to use it on a tablet while away from an internet connection. That's because it stores your calendar on the Amazon cloud and if you aren't connected and logged into the app store it won't run. I understand the reason, they do it so that you can share calendars between devices but it's a poor choice. The right way to do it would be to store the calendar locally and sync it with a cloud based calendar when connected. That's the right way to do it and if they start doing that I'll start using it again. In the meantime I'm removing it from my Nexus 7.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a good read.  I wasn't happy with the ending. I had to make my own.  I would recommend it though.
B005LAII94|3.0|I will say upfront that I have not read the book that this movie is based on. In fact, I only learned it was based on a book after I watched it. So my review is just about the movie. The movie was entertaining, and I enjoyed watching it, until the ending (I will get to that later, and I will give a SPOILER ALERT before I give anything away). I just am a little bit mystified about what this movie was trying to be. I should also mention that I am a philosophy student, and I tend to interpret everything from that standpoint. I am always looking for the philosophy in everything. If you are uninterested in that kind of thing, I would recommend skipping my review. If you are interested in that kind of thing, well then, buckle up, because you are in for the ride of your life! (did I oversell it?)<br /><br />Other people have already described the plot, so I am just going to jump right into the thematic material. This movie seems to me to have a lot of material for a good movie, I am just not sure it makes that material into anything. There is the title for example. \\"Savages\\". The movie revolves around a conflict between relatively peace loving pot growers from California, and a violent Mexican drug cartel, and at various points in the movie each side refers to the other as \\"savages\\". Clearly the filmmakers are attempting to make a point here, I am just not sure what it is. That we are all savages at heart? That terms like \\"civilized\\", \\"cultured\\", and \\"savage\\" are relative? These are interesting ideas, and the exploration of those questions would make for a good movie, but as far as I can tell, this movie does not even attempt to explore those questions in any meaningful way. Which does not make it a bad movie, it just leaves me a bit perplexed.<br /><br />The tale is pretty straight forward. The pot growers are relatively decent human beings, and the Mexican cartel comes in and threatens to torture and kill someone they love, and so they retaliate. In other words, a plot you have seen many times before, which does not make it bad, I tend to enjoy good formulaic plots, but I feel like the title of the movie, and the throw away comments about \\"savages\\", sets up a kind of expectation that never really gets fulfilled. There is the expectation that something is going to be said on the theme of \\"savagery\\", and I just do not think that the film delivers. It would be like an announcement in the paper \\"Lecture on Savages\\" by Oliver Stone, Wednesday 7pm-8pm. Then you get there and he does not show up.<br /><br />The closest the film gets to saying anything explicit about \\"savagery\\" is at the end of the movie, during the last voiceover, where O. literally reads the dictionary definition of \\"savage\\". Um, really? That is where the movie went for its profound insight into savagery? Webster's? Like I said, none of this makes this a bad movie. It is not necessary for movies to provide deep insights into concepts like \\"savagery\\" to be good, but if you are hoping for some insight into the concept of \\"savagery\\" that you could not get from breaking out the dictionary, I think you will be disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />I think the best scene in the movie is the dinner with Elena (Selma Hayek) and O. (Blake Lively). That seems to me to be one scene where people claim to see some moral complexity in the film, because we get a little peek into the motivations behind Elena's assumption of the throne, and something rare happens: we feel sorry for the head of a drug cartel, even when she seems to be entirely in control, and at the height of her power. That is not entirely true since she is being driven out of Mexico by rival cartels, but we do get a peek into the violence and death that come along with her particular job. It is not an enviable life, and it is a mystery to me why any human being on earth would ever have ambition to become the head of a drug cartel. This, I think, is one of the achievements of the film. I cannot think of any other movie that portrays the head of a drug cartel in that way. Usually those kinds of villains are just caricatures. On the one hand, they represent our own desires for wealth, power, women, or to be free from moral constraints, etc., and on the other, they are empty place holders for all of our hate and fear, so that at the end of the movie, when they get their comeuppance, we all leave the theater feeling like we have experienced some kind of catharsis. All the terror we feel in our everyday lives has been turned back on the people who are responsible for that terror. And it feels good, for a little while anyways. That is the role that heads of drug cartels usually play in movies. This movie deserves credit for \\"complexifying\\" the picture a bit (that's right, I just made up a word, I warned you things might get crazy).<br /><br />One of the achievements of this movie is that it actually makes the audience sympathetic with the vicious head of a drug cartel who is holding an innocent woman captive. The problem is, again, I am not really sure what the point is. What is the film trying to say? That the heads of drug cartels are really sad, lonely, and misunderstood? I also do not think that this is really \\"moral complexity\\". It is \\"character complexity\\". The makers of the film created an interesting character, and they deserve credit, but there is no moral complexity there. Her actions are heinous. We do not leave the cinema with any deep questions about what is right or wrong.<br /><br />The same can be said in relation to the pot growers. Their dilemma does not really raise any deep moral questions. They are just in a bad situation, but that is what movies do. They put people in bad situations. My review is sort of  turning into a response to some other reviews I read, which is not what I intended. I just do not agree with the claim that this movie explores \\"moral complexity\\" any more deeply than any other movie that puts characters in situations where they have to make difficult decisions. Movies set these kinds of dilemmas up all the time, not because they are exploring moral themes, but because it creates tension. Is the good character going to let the person they love die, or are they going to commit a morally reprehensible act and lose their soul? So I do not think this movie is really saying anything very interesting about morality either.<br /><br />The last theme I will mention is the theme of our modern pot culture. It seems to me that Oliver Stone is taking some shots at that California culture (and I live in California by the way), particularly in the dinner scene, where O. is explaining her decision to leave community college to the person who is holding her captive and threatening to cut off her head if her \\"boyfriends\\" do not do as she says. That was, as I said before, a good scene. But I have to ask again, what is the point? What is Oliver Stone saying about our culture? It is possible that he is saying that it has a dark side that people do not pay attention to. That is an interesting idea! And it is the one idea that I think the film really does develop to some degree. There is, on the one hand, the sunny California beaches, and the friendly neighborhood pot stores, and then, there are the dark cells where people have their heads cut off by chain saws. People certainly have a tendency to ignore the dark side of things. Actually, what I should say is, people fail to see that the light and dark sides are often two sides of the same coin. You cannot have one without the other (in some cases, at least). In the case that this movie explores, you cannot have the the pot filled California lifestyle without the dark cells and decapitated bodies. Of course, one could certainly argue that the two sides only go together because marijuana is still illegal, and who knows, perhaps Oliver Stone meant the movie to be a giant \\"legalize marijuana\\" commercial.<br /><br />It is possible that I am searching too hard for this movie's \\"message\\" since it is, after all, an Oliver Stone picture, and we expect a message when Oliver Stone is involved. I read conflicting reviews of this movie. Some reviewers claimed that it was refreshing to see an Oliver Stone picture without a message, that was just good, not-so-wholesome entertainment. Other reviewers claimed that this movie represents Oliver Stone's triumphant return to the soap box. I am not sure it is a good thing that people are having such conflicting responses. I tend to think the movie is probably trying to say something, I just am not really sure what that is.<br /><br />From what I have said so far, it probably sounds like I really hated the movie, but I actually found it to be compulsively watchable. It works as an \\"action\\" movie, with interesting characters, and an interesting plot. I am just not sure that people should be trying to make more out of it than that. There were times when I had some complaints with the writing. A number of lines that seemed like they were meant to be profound fell flat for me. Especially in the voice-overs that open and close the movie. The acting was pretty good for the most part. No surprise that I thought Benicio del Toro, Selma Hayek, and John Travolta were the highlights in that regard. I could watch Benicio del Toro play a sociopath for hours on end.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say something about the ending, so here is my SPOILER ALERT. I am just not sure what to make of the ending. Unlike most movies this movie had two endings, and to be honest, I found them both unsatisfying. The first ending is unsatisfying because all the good guys die, the second is unsatisfying because it is basically a farce and anti-climactic. I have to say, I felt a brief moment of relief when the movie decided to rewind and replay the ending, because I did find the first ending unsatisfying, but it was sort of a slap in the face to be presented with another, almost equally unsatisfying ending, to replace the first. Not only did I find both endings to the movie unsatisfying, but I found the fact that there were two endings in the first place to be unsatisfying, and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why Stone decided to do that. It does not seem to me to serve any purpose. Neither ending seems to me to be making a point, or serve any artistic purpose. There is a \\"feel bad\\" ending where all the good guys die, and a \\"feel good\\" ending where everyone lives, and all the good guys move to a tropical island and live happily ever after (that might be an exaggeration). I am someone who firmly believes that art does not exist to fulfill our \\"human all too human desires\\". The short stories of Anton Chekhov, for example, are beautiful stories, but they almost always leave the reader unsatisfied. They are also great works of art, and the dissatisfaction felt by the reader is part of the artistic message. So I am fine, in principle, with unsatisfying endings, if they serve some artistic purpose. I just cannot figure out why Stone decided to have not one, but two, unsatisfying endings?<br /><br />It seems to me that you have two choices in regard to ending a movie: you can provide the satisfying ending, or you can decide to send a message with the ending. Since it does not seem to me that this movie was sending any very clear message with the ending, why not accept your status as an \\"action\\" flick, and just give the audience the satisfying ending they are craving, where the good guys triumph in a climactic gun battle, Lado (Benicio del Toro), who is the real villain of the film, gets what is coming to him, and everyone lives happily ever after. If you decide not to go either route, if you decide to provide an unsatisfying ending without sending any message, at least have the decency to give us ONE ending instead of TWO.<br /><br />If it were not for the ending, I would not hesitate to recommend this film, as a compellingly watchable film. It does not, in my opinion, deal with deep themes (like [[ASIN:B000HL093A Natural Born Killers]] or [[ASIN:B00005AUJQ Platoon (Special Edition)]]), but it is a good, entertaining, watchable movie. With the ending I am not sure what to recommend. Why can't you people just make up your own minds? Why does everything always have to be my fault?age\\" since it is, after all, an Oliver Stone picture, and we expect a message when Oliver Stone is involved. I read conflicting reviews of this movie.

0307720950|5.0|Every new technology and trend requires a champion and a voice to extol its virtues and to enthusiastically claim that the world will never be the same. That's exactly what Chris Anderson delivers in Makers. Whether the \\"maker movement\\" will indeed become the \\"third industrial revolution\\" only time will tell, but without a doubt, it will leave a large and lasting imprint on how and what we manufacture. For this reason alone, this is a book worth reading.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with technologies and services such as 3D printing, CNC machines and laser cutters, Arduino, Kickstarter and crowd-funding, then this book offers a great overview of the growing DIY manufacturing market, as well as its economics and some early (success) case studies.<br /><br />Well written, engaging read, and a topic that definitely deserves attention.

B00005T7I1|4.0|Dick Tracy is a literal and stylized adaptation of the beloved Chester Gould comic strip, Dick Tracy.  Directed masterfully by and starring Warren Beatty, this retro-styled film gives its target audience exactly what it wants: action, adventure, intrigue and even a little romance. The plot is minimalist storytelling, just like the old strips were, and involves all of the colorful, over-the-top gangsters who confront the intrepid detective. It's like an old Warner Bros. gangster movie on acid. This film has an all-star cast with Beatty as an everyman Dick Tracy, Al Pacino as the overdone villain Big Boy Caprice, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles, Paul Sorvino as Lips Manless and Madonna as the aggressive blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney.<br /><br />The production design delivers some serious eye candy with its exaggerated 1930's style world done only in primary colors. It is clear that Beatty took his cue from the source material and concentrated on the relationships of these people, whether strained, romantic, or hateful; making the film seem like it could really take place in the real world that was 1930's urban America.<br /><br />The score is impressive as well and is done by Danny Elfman, who, around the time of the film's release, had made a name for himself scoring comic book related films, such as Batman, Darkman and The Flash TV series.<br /><br />Great fun for the kids or the young at heart comic book fans.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Outstanding movie for size of budget and limitations that were thrown at the production company.  Nice job guys.  I would highly recommend this movie if you like comedy and great special effects.

055338466X|3.0|Being an avid science reader, I have been following Dr. Hawking's work for over a decade and enjoyed his earlier books including Universe in a nutshell, Theory of Everything and a Brief history of time. I started reading Grand design with great expectations and enjoyed Hawking's typical style of building up the explanations, progression towards a particular discovery and the occasional, witty scientific humor. The book does a fine job in explaining, for a scientifically minded reader, the key principles and ideas behind quantum physics, model-dependent realism, Feynman's sum over histories, the thought process behind string theory and its respective shortcomings as well as the ultimate lead-in to M-Theory. However, I was relatively disenchanted by the shielding Gott ist tot theme of the manuscript.<br /><br />It's fairly evident that Dr. Hawking has outdone everyone including Carl Sagan and Brain Greene in explaining our scientific legacy on the shoulders of giants. His succinct and clear explanation of Einstein's outrageous legacy of is marvelous. Unfortunately, it is disappointing to see that the grand design does not follow the same knowledge-driven paradigm as seen in Hawking's earlier writings; rather than keeping the emphasis on scientific process and elucidation of ever so elusive M-theory, the book starts engaging into philosophical first cause arguments, fine-tuning quandaries and meta-physical squabbles without providing sufficient background or scientific justification to whichever. This theme is evident throughout the book where impertinent mythological allegories are repeatedly used as slighting argument; naturally resulting in discourteous hand waving which is a blatant digression from etiquette of great scientific minds. Dr. Lennox's response to Grand Design [[ASIN:0745955495 God and Stephen Hawking: Whose Design Is It Anyway?]] is definitely worth reading to further discover these facets of discourse.<br /><br />Another challenge which defied the authors of Grand Design was how to stop regurgitating information which has been discussed in the earlier books as prefaces and keep repetition to a minimum. A significant amount of conversation in the Grand Design leading up to theory of unification was already preamble in Hawking's earlier writings. Nevertheless the book is a noteworthy reading in modern physics with clarity and defining illustrations. I probably would have enjoyed it more if instead of making broader disparaging claims like \\"philosophy is dead\\", the grand design would have surfaced as an exemplar of how scientific process is alive and well.hors of Grand Design was how to stop regurgitating information which has been discussed in the earlier books as prefaces and keep repetition to a minimum.

B008G3N71W|4.0|Just finished this novel, the first I've read of Chloe Thurlow's novels. I have to take this as a surreal read, because the things Greta May character ends up doing with unknown people and with no mention of safety just sends out the wrong message for anyone copying in real life, and some younger people do! Not safe. Yet, there are times when young I have done what I now consider stupid and dangerous to life, limb and health!!!<br /><br />Greta, a dramatist through and through taking all life throws at her as a role to be played come what may, apt for her surname. Richard, manipulative, sees and aims to get what he wants. From sexually experiencing all sorts of untried activities, some I personally found nauseating, but then I have a thing about cleanliness and Greta doesn't!<br />She ends up ultimately being trained as a pony girl, which I don't really understand the allure of. Richard's main aim for her isn't ever made clear in words but is unravelled through action and activities.<br /><br />Ultimately there is no relationship and I guess I like my characters to have some care even as Dom/Sadist for submissive/slave, but this doesn't occur. Supposedly it all leads to her finding herself, very theatrical and as I said strangely surreal. Bertold Brecht would have loved it.<br />I read it as Book of the Month for my BDSM reading group and it's set in the UK, which I enjoyed as I could relate to all the places, whether people from other countries understand things like the tube as London's Underground rail system, or Camden Market, famous for clothing, fashion for non mainstream like Goths, fetish, etc. As opposed to food markets, I'm not so sure.<br /><br />However, it is quite well written, some very erotic naughty scenes before training, a couple sickening which I disliked<br />and were beyond my comfort zone...and I find I obviously have one!<br />Overall I give it 4 stars for quality, content and I enjoyed much of it too. I have bought another of Chloe's books too.<br />flag

B008R9QAY6|5.0|There are already highly complimentary reviews of this recording here on Amazon - all 5-star so far as I write. So I would just like to support the others and say that this is a terrific baroque opera in a brilliant performance. Of course five countertenors are a lot; but they are good, and to my ear their stratospheric tones are nicely balanced by the rich, colourful orchestration, directed here with superb pace and panache by Diego Fasolis, one of the most stylish baroque directors around.<br /><br />There's a lot of recitative in this score but it's all moved along at a very lively pace and hardly ever gets tedious. In any case, all this negotiation, discussion and revelation of the latest events and rumours is very much a part of the plot in what is essentially a political drama set in ancient Persia. So, apart from the usual love triangles and unrequited passions characteristic of baroque opera, we have power struggles, deception, intrigue, cruelty, false accusations, guilty secrets, snobbery, treachery and rebellion. How different are the politics of today - now we have all this plus elections!<br /><br />Back to the music, though, Jaroussky, Cencic and the other singers are terrific and so is the Concerto Köln orchestra. If you want to hear a few samples - which, at the time of writing, you can do by checking out the MP3 version on UK, French or German Amazon sites - try any of the three sections of the opening Sinfonia, or the final aria of Act I, 'Vo solcando un mar crudele' (I am adrift on a cruel sea), which apparently blew away Roman audiences in 1730. But in truth Vinci's music is full of invention and there are numerous fine arias; altogether this is an enterprising and outstanding recording of a work little known in recent times, and it's bound to appeal to just about all baroque opera fans.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|you will at least like it. It tells  you how much of your Battery life is left i am telling  you try it.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|A book you didn't want to put down, what happens next? Clever twist to the story with your emotions, loyalty  and opinions of the characters constantly changing.  The ending however left me really annoyed, although a clever ending, I guess I wanted a happy ever after ending, which probably was neither realistic or possible.  However thouroughly enjoyed the read.
B003T0G9XU|5.0|Nothing is as melancholy as finishing a good book. Having finished this book, I feel just such melancholy. I will have to find another now.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is by far Susan's best CD to date.  Every song is a real show-stopper and every song is so well suited to her magnificent voice.  Having Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond as duet partners are the best choices ever.  I highly recommend this CD to all lovers of good music.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|The latest Reached book does not disappoint. I've read them all now and recommend you give them a try.  Jack Reached is one bad ass good guy who always finds a way to win.  I like the action and the drama/suspense.

B007L6VR12|5.0|If you say that men and women cannot understand each other, fair enough, i have never been a woman, i have never had a period. how on earth am i supposed to know right?(>.>)<br /><br />but if you say that adults cannot understand kids, this is outrageous at best.<br /><br />my name is from Lyra and Will, if u read his dark materials you will know, I am a child supremist. Everything in the movies that describes naiveness of children are true, except for the fact that they assume that childrens are the weak minority.<br /><br />Childrens are not weak minorities, as much as I am not banned to write what I think after I watched one of the best movie I have watched on boy and girl affection and its social and spiritual context.<br /><br />Adults should not lose their children's heart either. I am 20, so what?<br /><br />After the movie at Marquee, I climbed the wall on the side to the patio where I walked my bike in, I assume that the people waiting in line to get out from the main exits must think I am childish, hopefully in a good way or they sat here 2 hours watchin this movie for nothing.<br /><br />When I enter the Marquee, there was only one girl from WUD film outside in charge, she was goingn to stamp me but then she didn't eventually, she just smiled and held the door for me. I was waiting for her to say bikes aren't allowed, but guess what, she did not even stare at my bike, all she did was implying me that she appreciate that I come for a good movie. And isn't it good? I barely read any review, I only read about Wes Anderson and stuff.<br /><br />We all have a rebel in us. Rebellious makes us creative, free, and organically naturally beautiful.<br /><br />I hope with all my soul that you have your own haven of heart. If you don't, you never will go for one in real life, you just won't ever have the chance to, and even if you are given the chance, you won't enjoy it cus it means nothing to you. (inspired by Bridge to Terabithia and many more)<br /><br />The answer is in the attemp, the value is in the effort, the happiness is in the journy, the reward is in the process. (again, inspired by Before Sunrise, and many other essays I read about life, and again, I do not care if you quote it without my discretion, because I do not consider high of myself, nor do i think those artists consider high of themselves, as much as they deserved to be considered highly, because in life, giving instead of having is the source of happiness)<br /><br />Me, Lyrill, hereby encourage all of you to start here, start ourselves, start right now, to rebel. Do something with heart, do something with a child in you, do something creative. Do something, that makes you happy, if it could be leaving some witty comments that makes me grin and touch my head.

B007EECSFA|4.0|The setup for The Secret Keeper begins in the prologue where Kate Morton deftly sets up the story to reel you in and keep you turning the pages. As a child born in the 1960's I am always interested in stories during that era and with this one set in England, where I hope to visit someday, I was all in. Laurel, at sixteen, lives a normal, happy life with her loving mother, father, three sisters and brother in their country home until it all change. Laurel, hidden in the tree house, watches as a stranger accosts her mother outside their home and sees something that it will take her years to understand fully. However, even at that age and beyond, Laurel knows their lives have been changed irrevocably.<br /><br />In present day, the children are called back to Greenacres Farm in Dorothy's 90th year due to her failing health. Laurel decides that in her mother's final days, she should seize the opportunity to find out from her mother what happened on that day more than fifty years ago.<br /><br />Morton is a pro at using past and present narratives to tell a story, and she does this admirably with Dorothy's story. In 1941 she was known as Dolly, an outgoing seventeen year old with a great lust for life, even in a time of war in England. I was completely fascinated with Dolly--just eating up all the details of her life when the narrative moves us back to 2011.<br /><br />Laurel becomes an amateur sleuth using things her mother says in present day to piece together the truth of that fateful day. Upon the discovery of an old attic trunk, she and her brother take it upon themselves to illuminate the past. As a reader, we know more, because we are able to follow Dolly back to the 1940's and the events that culminate on that day outside the farmhouse.<br /><br />Dorothy/Dolly is a contrast in opposites, which has one wondering which woman is the true Dorothy. As a third narrative from the past weaves into the last part of the book, it ramps up the suspense so thoroughly; you will be hard-pressed to put it down until the final satisfying twist.<br />Morton's writing is deft, lyrical and she paints a thorough picture of setting which makes you feel as if you're right there with her characters. The story reveals itself in layers, giving you just enough to keep you turning the page, and with it rounding out at 450 pages, this is no small feat.<br />I received this book from Atria as a ReadNow galley, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Kate Morton's The Secret Keeper is a riveting story you won't want to miss. Can you say bestseller?
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I loved this movie.  Any Batman fan would be proud to add this to his/her collection.  It was a unique twist to the Batman legend, and I would love to see more of the same.  Batman is the same, but he wears many faces.

B009ERK1T0|4.0|In my opinion Diamond Eyes is a perfect album. I can listen to it from beginning to end love every song. This is not the case with the new album.<br /><br /> Right off the bat, the first track is only so-so. Romantic dreams is pretty solid, but the album doesn't really start cooking until Leathers which is an awesome song. Poltergeist is cool, but then comes my favorite song on the album Entombed, which gives me chills. Graphic nature goes no where and feels like filler, but then we are right back to quality with Tempest which is a very cool song. Gauze is fine, with highs and lows right in the song. Rosemary is fantastic and is my 2nd favorite song on the album. Goon squad is just whatever and What happened to you is a pretty decent finish to the album.<br /><br />So overall, this is a disjointed and inconsistent album, with highs and lows. Its doesn't just flow from beginning to end, which is where Diamond Eyes was successful. Regardless, if you are a Deftones fan, its still a great addition to the collection and I would recommend it.
159420411X|5.0|I ignored this book for a while as it appeared among my Amazon recommendations.  I thought that it would be just a watered down version of Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" or Mlodinow's \\"The Drunkard's Walk\\" which I enjoyed so much.  Then I read a positive review in The Economist and checked it out.  I'm so glad I did.  This book is awesome!  Not only did I learn a lot about the Baysean approach to prediction and prediction revision but I learned so much from Silver's insights into so many important topics of the day.  Silver ranges from political punditry to baseball, poker, hurricanes, earthquakes, terrorism and the climate with the same insight, humor and excellent story-telling.  With his \\"come let us reason together\\" approach to complex and sometimes controversial topics, Silver elevates the debate and makes us all wiser.  This book should be required reading for all high school students everywhere.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|I saw this in theaters after being told that \\"not knowing about what happens in the movie makes it better.\\" This was apparently a common thing critics said. Well, it turns out that they were right. Not knowing about this movie would make it better. Walk away now, before you waste even a moment of your life on this poorly plotted, predictable, anti-thrill ride of a non-adventure.<br /><br />Edit: I know you're probably thinking \\"wow, that guy's review didn't tell me anything about the movie.\\" So here's a bit more detail: You know that guy who keeps emailing you about wiring $10,000,000 from his family's fortunes? Do you think he is who he says he is? Congratulations. You've just discovered an analogy for the plot of the film: people aren't who they claim to be on the internet. SHOCKER.
B009YU62H2|3.0|This is a really good return album for Soundgarden with a good mix of songs that represent their sound and style. There are songs on King Animal are great and some that are not so great (but not unlistenable, just not that interesting to me). A couple of the songs on the album have become instant all time Soundgarden favorites of mine upon first listen. I feel the album starts off lackluster with Been Away Too Long (one of my least favorite tracks on this album) starts to get a bit better with Non-State Actor, picks up from there with By Crooked Stars, then gets awesome with A Thousand Days Before (not quite my least favorite song) and Blood on The Valley Floor (second favorite). The album levels out some with Bones of Birds and Taree, then suddenly goes bad with Attrition (my least favorite song on the album, I just don't care for this song much at all hehe). Thankfully things manage to recover from the earache that is Attrition with the decent tunes Black Saturday, Halfway There and Worse Dreams. Eyelid's Mouth brings it back with a good grooving hard rocker with good guitar interplay between Cornell and Thayil and then ends rather eclectically with Rowing.<br /><br />Overall King Animal sounds like a blending of Superunknown and Down on the Upside; it sounds like familiar Soundgarden which is not a bad thing. Subtracted 2 stars because I feel there are a couple great songs, a few really good ones and the other half of the songs are a mix of decent, not so great and bad (I'm talking about you Attrition) and for such a long awaited return album many of the songs just feel too short, as if they could have done an extra minute or two on some of them. Still a solid return album for Soundgarden after being gone for so long.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, Grisham spins another wonderful yarn - difficult to put down.  Well written with good character development.  My only drawback - I was able to figure out the ending a little over half-way through the story.
B004SIP8SY|4.0|Same as Kill Bill 1.  Love these movies.  Better deal on Amazon. Not much extra for the Blu.  Inside doesn't look as pretty as combo pack, but better separately, than paying $25 each.

B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book! I was hook by the story from page 1.... I just finished reading the second book, I couldn´t stop reading!! I was a fan od the Fifty Trilogy, but this one is WAY better that Fifty Shades. The story is more complicated and the main characters are more real.<br /><br />The only thing that I´m not happy with, is that the third book is released next year!!!<br /><br />Hope you like it as much as I did.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella books. Her humor makes me laugh out loud. I literally had tears of laughter rolling down my face when Lara was on her first date with Ed. But what I really loved about this book was how it reminded me of how special our elderly friends and family are in our lives. Learn from them. Listen to them. And enjoy the time you have with them.

B005KN5AES|5.0|Wow, this is a great cd, bought it over three months ago and can't stop listening to it. The music is hard and heavy, the vocals are great the musicianship is just fantastic, its also easy to follow because of the melodies. Their is not one dud on this cd, its not the same as Fire Down Under which did not have one dud on it either. Like I wrote , all the tracks are fantastic but my favorites are Riot, Crawling, Fall Before Me, Sins of the Father, Immortal Soul, Insanity, and Whiskey Man. Just plain superb.<br />The music is very catchy. Again just listen to the pipes on this guy!<br /><br />On a very very sad note Mark Reale ( Riot's great founder guitarist ) passed away, he will be missed. I have to say he went out with a bang.<br /><br />Whatever the price, get this cd, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />C'mon people buy this cd, it is one of a kind. It plain rocks and all the tracks are fantastic. Update 1-9-14.<br /><br />O.K. O.K O.K. and the final decision is....this is my #1 cd of my top five, 3-5-14, I still cannot stop listening to it.

B000K7VHPU|5.0|The Illusionist is a beautiful and engrossing film set in turn-of-the-century Vienna.  Equal parts supernatural mystery, political thriller and love story, the film is about a magician, a prince, a princess, a policeman and illusion versus reality. The main protagonist is Eisenheim (Edward Norton), the illusionist who draws huge audiences with his amazing feats.  He uses his magic to reunite with his childhood sweetheart from whom he had been separated by class differences.  I liked this film very much.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Oh my word, I love this! This is a fabulous production.  I watch it again and again.  It complements my experience of reading the book.  This gives so much more.

You will have the rich joy of these women in Pride and Prejudice.
B004SIP98S|5.0|The Queen pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Most of the scenes take place inside Buckingham Palace and at the queen's Scottish estate Balmoral.  This docudrama begins just days before Diana's fatal car crash in 1997.  The princess is seen only in television news clips and photographs as the film remains fixed on Elizabeth and her relationship with the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair.  Helen Mirren's performance as Elizabeth is so subtle and fine it is easy to overlook its greatness.  The film`s best quality is that it tells this bit of familiar history in such a way as to present no villains or victims.  Instead we are given a greater understanding of each person involved.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is fun. I really like the way it starts out easy and progress to difficult/hard. I think it would be great for children to play with. I'd get it again.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I like and own the first Christmas CD, and i was happy to see this one for such a good deal.  Just as good
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Very lovely (at times) and odd. Beautiful cinematography. Um, strange story and well - okay, pretty strange everything. Nothing makes any sense at all, so don't bother using your brain. I think the kids could watch, I don't remember anything too violent, sexy, etc. Just saw it with my husband & we thought it could have been edited - to about 15/20 minutes. Actors did their best to hold this mediocre script aloft. Little resemblance to the fairy tale you remember, this is sadly very forgettable.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I highly recommend the Piano Guys! They are a fun bunch of guys who really enjoy making their music (You can tell when you watch their vidoes!)<br /><br />We love that they take the current hits and put their own sound to them. Totally amazing!

B0063IH60K|5.0|A great place for a quick game while waiting for a phone call, something to cook or waiting for someone to come to pick me up to go out for the evening.  Also Amazon's Solitaire on Kindle is always available at hand instead of hunting for a pack of cards.
B009SMW9IW|5.0|Tinsel and Lights is a perfect companion for the season at hand. Tracey's smooth and familiar vocals provide both the comfort, joy and bittersweet element that some of the most memorable classics conjure up. I would be hard pressed to come up with a list of favorites as the entire album is perfect. \\"River\\", \\"Hard Candy Christmas\\" and \\"Maybe This Christmas\\" could be my top 3. Seriously, don't think about it just buy it if you ever liked Tracey or Everything But The Girl. You will not regret it.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I just finished watching the VHS BBC 200 Aniversary Edition I bought at Goodwill! I am convinced that VHS still rocks! Case in point is to watch a VHS copy of Jesus Christ Superstar and then compare it to the DVD edition! The sound track in the digital version sucks! I have various VHS incarnations of JCS and they are different but soooo far exceeds the digital soundtrack on the DVD version! At anyrate this movie on VHS is amazing and as other reviewers suggests the colors on this analog version just look great granted the sharpness of a DVD or Blue-ray is lacking, however, there is still something to be treasured in the original VHS format! I am a musician and still record on analog tape so the sound quality of a movie to me is more than 50% of my enjoyment especially with soundtracks like this one! However, I would love to see the Blue-ray version as the cinematography is so excellent! Someone needs to design a mix digital video/analog sound format! LOL!!! All in all this is a great movie! The reason I thought this (I just figured out) is that it is \\"very\\" linguistly advanced! Also, it exposed all the false people in your life that can perhaps get your attention and even admiration until truth eventually gets exposed. But it is the researcher mind here in Lizzie that eventually figures it all out even when she finds here earlier assumptions were false and based on her screwy family upbringing especially her crazy mother who tries to manipulate the world around her constantly and a passive intellectual father who fortunsately does sometime see through the veil! Such an excellent flick! Got to get this one on Blue-ray though to see if the excellent cinematography surpasses my VHS copy and if sound quality passable! Lastly, There is a very elequent way here of telling people frankly what you think without having to couch anything or hold it all inside! So in this time you are allowed complete truth and honesty in your expression and if those you speak to are not evolved enough to get what you actual just said you still get to amuse those around you that do! Love it! Would love to receive comments!

Did I mention that I liked it?

B002ZG997C|5.0|This is Mad Max,meets Indiana Jones at the end of civilization.<br />If you like Denzel Washington, you will see him as you've never<br />seen him before. If you like mindless evil and a plot that keeps<br />you wondering what it all about and a mind-blowing surprise ending<br />that you never saw coming you will like this movie. If you like<br />If you like the song that Al Green and the BEE GEES have in common,<br />you'll love this movie.  If you like heroines,you'll really love<br />this movie. If you hate all of that,but like action and adventure,<br />you might just like this movie.<br /><br />Warning:It has an R rating due to generous doses of profanity and violence,<br />so keep it away from young children. But if you like that,you'll love this.<br />This movie does have a message, but if you don't get it don't worry.<br />It does not beat you over the head.<br />Knowledge is power.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I've loved Crossme color. I've had hours of fun with it and have solved almost all of the puzzles. I have been really sick lately and Crossme color has given me hours of enjoyment. The only thing I would love to see is the option for hints since some of the puzzles have been too hard for me to figure out (but maybe it's just me?). I plan to buy the other version of this when I'm done with this one.
1582403589|5.0|I watched season 1 & 2 before I read the graphic novel, so I came in with expectations. It really exceeded all of them. Great artwork! Great story!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I haven't finished the book, but, so far I like it a lot, like I do most all of Grisham's books. His novels are easy to read, and keep your attention. He is my favorite author.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This app loads well, Performs well. My only problems is navigation  between note books. I think this should be smoother. Over all it is a functional app.

030758836X|1.0|I got this book because people were raving about it.  I am totally perplexed by what made it such a great  book.  It was boring, the premise was not believable from the very beginning, there was nothing about the characters that made me want to learn more about them. If you want suspense give me a Linwood Barclay book any day over this author.
B008476HBM|5.0|Wonderful read! Ms. Austen's characters are so alive in her writing. Much to the chagrin of everyone around me, I couldn't put it down until it was done!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful movie with great stars of film and theatre. The concept is appealing, who wouldn't want to live in a colorful country and experience another culture?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good book but aside from the fact that Christian is rich and has radical sex habits, it's the classic story of a guy falling in love.  Nothing original about the book.
B007N0AEWY|5.0|Great music from a unique individual. Clean straightforward tunes with lyrics to match. 50's - early 60's guitar stylings that sound fresh and new. For a real treat, catch Nick Waterhouse on \\"Live From Daryl's House\\" on the web. You'll be hooked. Can't wait for the next album. Thanks Amazon.
B004SBX112|1.0|Will not function on my device, most of the new birds updates have stoped working.  They all worked fine before this new round of updates, and the new star wars version never worked.  My device is running ice cream sandwich 4.0
B008Q0AZVK|5.0|Must be too many youngsters rating this movie? Solid story and great acting. Rather classy and erotic, also. America directors need to lean from the experts; as usual, the British. They are the champions and will remain the champions til the end of time, I guess? American movies..are the pits, generally speaking.
B009CPRYG2|1.0|What a rip off. Amazon should look into better describing some of there items. The price was ridiculously high. I watched it since I paid for it, very disappointing and a waste of money and time.
B000FC1192|5.0|I am like many of you, I saw the movie WAY before reading the book [Which BTW is not a good lullaby movie;)]. I recentley checked it out from the library. I got to the part with her other mother and quit cuz I knew I would have nightmares---Its that good. but enough about me, this is Coraline's story. C. has moved into the middle flat with her parents. They dont have time for her so she went exploring. she found a door that wouldnt open. she found the key and came apon her other parents who are bitter sweet. ill let you read the rest. P.S. the rats wanted me to tell you, we are small and we are many. we are many we are small. we were here before you rose. we will be here when you fall. [rats are cryptic huh;)]

B000KX0IOA|5.0|\\"Gandhi\\" begins with a voice stating that: \\"No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man.\\" The assassination of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's as by Nathuram Godse is the pivotal first scene and the move then segues into his funeral which was attended by people from around the world. The next scene is a flashback to South Africa when Gandhi, then in his twenties, is thrown from a train because he is \\"colored\\". This begins his first experience with racism and prejudice against Indians and he starts a campaign for the civil rights of his people which successfully ends with the implementation of a few civil rights.<br />Because of his success in South Africa, Gandhi is asked to return to India to aid in the fight against British imperialism. He chooses a tactic called non-violence and non-cooperation and recruits most of India. His efforts are met with violence and jail but also gain worldwide attention and a spotlight on India. Because of Gandhi's genius Great Britain is forced to grant independence to India.<br />After gaining independence India has a civil war between Muslims and Hindus and Gandhi goes on a hunger strike to convince the two groups to stop fighting. The war ends but India becomes divided into two separate factions and a new country called Pakistan is formed. This division takes place despite the objections of Gandhi and his willingness to share power with the Muslim.<br />Although his efforts are unsuccessful most of Gandhi's life is spent as a peace maker between the Hindus and the Muslims. He gains enemies on both sides and is eventually killed by one. The scene at the end shows Gandhi's cremation and his remains float down the Ganges River and Gandhi's voiceover saying: \\"There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for some time they can seem invincible, but in the end the will always fall. Think of it. Always.\\"<br />This movie relates to World Religions because it highlights two major religions: Islam and Hinduism. The two faiths have more in common than not because they both have monotheistic beliefs: although Hinduism cites many gods they all lead to one Supreme Being and Allah has 99 attributes; Hindus and Muslims rely on the power of prayer; both groups believe that doing right deeds will bring blessings; both believe in the end of the world and the salvation of deserving believers.<br /><br />  Works Cited<br />Fisher, Mary Pat.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|First I got the regular version after seeing it On Demand on U Verse. I loved this movie so much I got the non Bl-ray 3 disc set. Later I bought the best version of the LG 3D I could find which is awesome I might add. Having the means but not the player, I got the matching LG Bl-ray 3D player. The first movie I bought was Resident Evil Afterlife and was blown away by my first Blu-ray movie which was also my first 3D movie. Fast forward a couple of months and Avatar Blu-ray 3D is released and I had to have it. I got the 2 disc version that has the 2D and 3D both HD on one disc and the regular original version disc. I WAS BLOWN AWAY watching one of my all time favorite movies in HD 3D! If you have not experienced Avatar in 3D you are missing out on a whole new experience! It is like watching all again for the first time. I was totally pulled in and felt like I was part of the action. If you are thinking of getting a 3D setup and are a die hard Avatar fan, go for it and you will not be disappointed! The days of just looking at a movie are passing and being part of the movie will be the norm.<br />TV - LG G2 With Google Chrome Browser [[ASIN:B0074WVYNO LG 55G2 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Google TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses]]<br />Player - [[ASIN:B00793MIGK LG BP620 3D Blu-Ray Player with Built-In Wi-Fi - Black]]
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its very addicting but it needs to have more coins. it also has to be faster and improved quality...good game so far..
B008G33NFC|5.0|Fabulous, just Fabulous.  Waiting for my DVD version and have been sampling this new concert and must say a chilling performance.  The entire production is first rate and can't wait to hear it on my HT.  Huge caveat:  Do not buy the Blu Ray.  Local players are not recognizing the discs for whatever reason.  Amazon however was very responsive and took care of my issue in two hours.  If they (Amazon) read these reviews; please, stop distributing the Blu Ray until a resolution is in place.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i love the hunger games so much i always think books are better than movies it tells you more about it!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is vintage Grisham, with enough twists and surprises to make it a compelling read. It also makes quite a statement about our justice system. Whether it is totally accurate in that regard is arguable but you can't help but be drawn to the main character.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Speedy delivery and works just fine. The best movie I've ever seen, hands-down. Brilliant soundtrack, brilliant acting, brilliant story, and it gives you loads to think about afterwards.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We ordered the Avengers 4 Disc combo... and we do have a 3D television.  The graphics on the tv at home even rivaled the movie theater!  This combo is perfect for those who watch in different venues, as we watched on regular and 3D, but love being able to have the Digital copy to have on the iPad as well to watch whenever we are on a trip too.  Great value for the $$.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I was unable to see this at the theater, so I rented via Amazon online rental.  To be honest I thought the movie was great.  Captain America was well the same guy in the comic books, a strong man with black and white convictions.  Iron Man was as good if not better than his solo movies, the Hulk seems to be gaining some of the cross intellect from Bruce that shows up in the later comic books and Thor is well Thor from the legends an immortal who loves Earth and is willing to protect it.  Loki is the trickster and again the bad guy, you know the plot and most of the characters and yet knowing what might happen just pulls you into the show.  It is a great action adventure with a touch of fantasy the whole family can enjoy, assuming your family has children whom can tell the difference between a movie and the real world.  In short I say watch it the special effects are great the storyline is good and the acting is well real.
B009YU62H2|4.0|So like many others viewing this page and buying this album \\"THIS IS THE ALBUM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO FOR THE LAST 10+ YEARS\\".<br /><br />How does it stand up?<br /><br />Before doing this review, I listened to \\"Badmotofinger\\", \\"Superunknown\\", and \\"Down on the Upside\\" to get a feel of what I needed to say.<br /><br />I'll safely say that the first three songs are the most thunderous on the album and probably worth the entire price on Amazon. It's great to hear Chris Cornell finally teamed back up with Soundgarden. There's more talent in Kim Thayil's shit than there is in the entire leftovers of Audioslave and he still shows it. Gone are the days of Tom Morello doing solos that sound like he's trying to jumpstart a Volkswagon Thing with the testicles of a horny dying cow. Somehow on some other planet those times qualified as \\"guitar solos\\", even being a Rage fan, I still don't know why or how. Matt Cameron can play circles around Brad Wilk. There were so many times I was left saying \\"WTF\\" how is he able to pull this off and the song stay together, when listening to Matt and the odd beats signatures on \\"No State Actor\\". Timmy C is nothing compared to Ben Shepard. This isn't to say Audioslave was bad.. I liked them. But real fans of Soundgarden would admit, Audioslave was Soundgarden Lite.<br /><br />When it gets to the forth song \\"Thousand days before\\", things start breaking down a bit. I couldn't help but think that the song sounded like a Janes Addicition rehash. I couldn't put my finger on it the first time through, but then I started thinking that Perry Farell could sing this song and it could fit perfectly on the B-Side of \\"Ritual de lo Habitual\\". Being that I'm not much of a Janes fan anymore, I normally skip this song.<br /><br />The 5th song, \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" is OK..<br /><br />I normally skip 6,7, and 8, mostly because I don't really dig them all that much. Nothing new that grips me and shakes me. Bones of Birds is OK at best and there's nothing new and exciting on Taree and Atrition. They don't really grip me all that much.<br /><br />Where I get back into the album is the song \\"Black Saturday\\". It's not on the same level of depth as songs like \\"The day I tried to live\\" or \\"Fell on black days\\", but it's still really good and a song that was needed on the album. Something slower and darker but really listen-able at the same time.<br /><br />The next song, I have no idea why it ended up on a Soundgarden album. \\"Halfway there\\" sounds like Kim, Matt, and Ben were locked out of the studio and Chris Cornell invited Weezer to take guitar, bass and drum duties. It does not fit on the album whatsoever and with ANY of Soundgarden's catalog. I hope Chris leaves this kind of stuff for albums where it actually fits, like another solo album that doesn't feature Timberland. ;-)<br /><br />The remaining three songs are good, nothing really noteworthy to write home to mother about, but they're still good.<br /><br />All in all, I will say it's probably the best rock album of the year thus far. It brings one back to the time when music was music, a time when Justin Beiber's parents still had the opportunity to abort him! I hope Soundgarden continues to make really good music and helps bring back the Alternative Rock/Metal/\\"whatever the heck Soundgarden qualifies as\\" genre.<br /><br />One last thing, someone on here was complaining about the lack of depth to the lyrics on this album compared to other albums.. To you, remember that \\"Kickstand\\" was a song that Chris wrote about his male appendage and \\"Full on Kevin's Mom\\" was well.. about a friend of Chris's sleeping with another friend's mom. Get over it.<br /><br />Thanks, I hope this helps others out there!<br /><br />For a band just dusting itself off from a long slumber, I give it an A-.<br />The album itself if held to other Soundgarden, Audioslave, Black Sabbath, and Led Zepplin albums.. I'd give it a solid B.<br /><br />Thanks!
1579129129|5.0|My husband, a microbiologist, asked be to order this for him and he seems very happy with it.  Condition was great<br />and delivery rapid.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Just as I expected  and when, due to the correct description. Good timing, and I'm now enjoying my DVDs. Thanks again!
B008G8SFGO|3.0|To begin with, I must say I've enjoyed Monster a lot more than Sonic Boom. I think the band is less contrived, taking more chances and definitely doing more right than wrong, musically speaking. Tommy and Eric have been allowed a lot more freedom this time and it shows.<br /><br />My problem with it is that it got me hooked up until The Devil Is Me but then it's a bit downhill from there. I just lose interest.<br /><br />Now, while I'm not very enthusiastic about Tommy's or Eric's input, I have enough respect for Gene and Paul to keep following Kiss, so it came as no surprise the fact that Outta This World and All For The Love Of Rock And Roll just got in the way. Those two songs are in no way on par with Paul's or Gene's. Outta this World, for instance, is bland as hell and the lyrics are also weak compared to the rest of the album. \\"You and me, we're like TNT\\"? That's lifted from Danger Us, to begin with. And \\"If you're ready to rock, I'm ready to roll\\"? Ultra convincing stuff. How original!!! I just can't get past those.... And somehow Take Me Down Below and Last Chance are not good enough to restore the album's momentum. Regarding its format then, I've been wondering whether a Kiss album really needs to come out like Sonic Boom or Monster did where there's apparently a genuine need for songs sung by Tommy and Eric as if they REALLY were Ace and Peter. Go figure...<br /><br />Overall, a good enough album for the Kiss of 2013. The mastering job is WAY too loud, by the way.
B00914JWSW|5.0|bought it for my wife and she loves it, need I say more I enjoy Barbara but not my favorite
B00914JWSW|5.0|This is by far one of the best!  I can't stop playing it's so classic Barbra.  A voice that will never be duplicated.<br />I've been a fan from the start.  Thank you Barbra I hope you do a release me 2
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I just bought it because it came up in things I might need to consider and needed to reach $25.00 for free shipping. I did not know there Diana had this album out. Boy am I glad this is one of the best disk I have purchased in several years. Wake up to it most every morning.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I thought great I want this app I was uaing facebook to take picture. It great for thw first couple time I used it. Then it won't open and made my kindle fire hd freeze up. Its not so good and not worth a penny.

B000XUBFE2|2.0|I went in to the book knowing it was a YA novel. Enjoyed reading the first half then just didn't care enough to finish it!<br />Read some reviews of the ending and was glad I didn't waste anymore time on it.

B0004Z33G4|5.0|Most people who order this have probably seen it before.  However, it is a good action packed story that ends well.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Love this CD, as always, Barbra's voice is spectacular. Love the song choices and so glad she released this one.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|Works great for basic printing with my Eepson Artesian 835. Remember to pay attention to what this free version does versus the paid version.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have not finished the book but there is no doubt that I will.  I love KF&#34;s books and this one is no different.  It is an interesting and satisfying read.  When I put it down--I can't wait to get back.
B009LRE040|5.0|This is the best movie in the trilogy. The stakes are higher, the story is better, and the villain's the best. I loved the first two movies and i'm not saying that heath ledger didn't do a great job as the joker but tom hardy's bane is better. in this one you actually feel as though batman's really in trouble. That aside there were two serious problems with this movie, one the voice over at the beginning is horrible so thank you to everyone who cried that they couldn't understand bane talk, thanks to you they added a shitty voice over which is my only real problem with the movie. my other problem is that catwoman saves batman from having his head blown off at the end. as usual the good guy defeats the bad guy and saves the day. are they ever going to change it up.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven is another in a number of books out on \\"near death\\" experiences.  I generally love these kinds of books and think they are especially pertinent to this time on earth when there are so many changes and challenges facing humanity.  What is somewhat different about this book is the technical medical information provided by the author, a highly respected neurosurgeon with a wealth of knowledge about the brain and how he discounts any possibility that his near death experience could be anything but real.  This book should be read  especially by scientifically oriented individuals in the medical profession who tend to try to come up with explanations of how such an experience might occur as a sort of hallucination.  It is especially pertinent for people in the medical profession who are around people who are considered to be terminal or who have survived a serious illness and talk about their experiences.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I found each of the books interesting. I read the Hunger Games and had to continue with the series. The description of the characters in the games and the activities that they found themselves in was exciting. As soon as I finished reading Catching Fire I began the third book \\"Mockingjay\\". They make you think about our world and that this could be our country in the future.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|Once again Michael Crichton makes fascinating a future technology.  I wonder if the story might have been a little different if he had the chance to finish this novel, but the description and imagination of the technology is pure Crichton.  It reminded me of Timeline a little bit.  If you like Sci-fi/tech-fi it's a fun, quick read.
081297381X|1.0|This book focused way to much on the author and his extremely high opinion of himself.  He also never gives an explanation for how the concept of the Black Swan is new.  This is nothing more than a 'fat tail' event, and these are well-known and studied.  It seems like he is trying to get his name attached to the concept ('fat tail') by coming up with a catchier title ('Black Swan'), though I don't think he has contributed anything to the field.  I tried reading the whole book, but the writing is just insufferable, so I eventually gave up.<br /><br />I can't recommend that anyone read this.  It is just terrible.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|It's no wonder this movie didn't last long in the theater, it's just plain horrible.  I actually turned it off and I paid for the rental!!

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a lot of game for your money. Good story and fun puzzles. Looking forward to the next one!
0316212377|5.0|Another must read for Culture fans.  One gets a little closer look at what it means to Sublime! Lastly, more insight into the Minds and their own \\"emotional\\" inner workings. Another great book from Iain M. Banks.
B006UHZ7OQ|4.0|I carry two cameras with this vest with the 70-300 mm lens in the front and the wide angle on the hip.  The vest distributed weight of cameras reasonably well.  The only complaint is that the hip carrier is in the position that when you sit down, the camera body may rotate to the angle which can slide out.  This happened to me many times when I ride the tour bus.  When the camera came out, the sling clip saved the drop.  But there was one time that I failed to hook the clip and the camera dropped on the floor!!!  I wish there were a lock mechanism that the camera would never come out.<br /><br />The set also came with a mounting plate as tripod adapter.  But for tripods with an adapter mount head, this mounting plate is useless because the tripod mounting head will interfere with the vest adapter.  So I had to unscrew the vest adapter every time that I use the tripod.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|Deftones' seventh studio album comes at a time when the band find themselves crossing a bridge in their retrospective careers, only added to the fact that Deftones are still without longtime bassist Chi Cheng due to obvious reasons.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan (roughly translated to &#34;premonition of love&#34; or &#34;anticipation of love&#34;) is the follow-up to the very successful Diamond Eyes which was released in 2010, and marks the second album with stand-in bassist Sergio Vega.<br /><br />A Deftones album is always something special to me as I always anticipate the months ahead of listening and re-listening, looking through the album artwork and lyrics, then retracing the Deftones' steps by listening to their discography.<br /><br />Diamond Eyes with its white owl on the front cover was, in more ways than one, Deftones' rebirth are troubling times with the accident of their longtime bassist Chi, who is slowly but surely making his recovery. [...]<br /><br />There is a great amount of depth on this album as well some amazing musicianship, only added to the fact that Deftones have been around a while ever since release their debut ablum 'Adrenaline'. Since then they have evolved and gain an extra musician on the keyboards to add more depth and variety to the music; the tragic accident which left bassist Chi Cheng immediately threw a massive question over their collective heads, and this subsequently shelved their unreleased album 'Eros', only to recruit the assistance of Sergio Vega and then release their phenomenal album 'Diamond Eyes'.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan is a record that has depth, focus and plenty of heaviness and softness that I'm sure will please all generations of Deftones fans, whether you love the old or newer stuff. This album has plenty of riffage between all the atmospheric bliss and soft tones, provided by Stephen Carpenter; whilst Abe Cunningham is Deftones pivotal member providing solid drumming through every album; Chino Moreno not only does vocals but as well he plays guitar on some of this album, giving the guitar that extra bite in some places, and his vocal is unique as ever - giving less screams throughout this album; Sergio Vega is a man and musician I really have to give my hand to, for stepping into Deftones delicate position in such a tragic time, but he has performed brilliantly in the studio and live; Stephen Carter, the junior member of Deftones adds variety and depth to this album as well as adding some cool effects.<br /><br />The album flows extremely well from one track to another in progression of the album's sequencing, and the only questioning remains for me now: What next?<br /><br />Overall, Koi No Yokan is an extremely dense album that reaffirms Deftones world-renowned status as a top band studio wise and even more so in the live stage, only added to the fact that they have never made a bad album. Each album is different from the last and completely sits alone where can people can enjoy it at their own pleasure, but it can become addictive over time. The album opens extremely well with 'Swerve City' and ends brilliantly with the closer 'What Happened To You?'; this is an album that is surely to be enjoyed...at least I know I am. In short: a fantastic album by the Deftones, and Koi No Yokan merely adds another milestone to many others.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan is the seventh album by American metal band Deftones, and was released on November 12, 2012 in the UK and then on November 13, 2012 in the States via Reprise Records. It marks the second album with stand-in bassist Sergio Vega; it is 10 tracks long and clocks in at 42 minutes in total length.<br /><br />RATING: 5 / 5.

B007I1QUYE|2.0|Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Toby is nerdy and homely to the point of neurosis. Andrew's Spidey is bookish, but also skateboards in his high school's halls. Agressive, bold and self-assured. Taller, leaner, way better looking; Andrew's reboot of the franchise makes these 3 earlier McGuyre Spider-Man films suffer by comparison

1849025975|4.0|Orwell's experience of two simultaneous wars is chronicled in the pages of this book: one by the forces of the Left against the attempt (ultimately successful) of General Francisco Franco to take over the government during the Spanish Civil War, and the other within the Left itself as, by Orwell's account, the Communists attempted in 1937 to seize both the military and the propaganda advantage.  The book contains Orwell's usual fine writing and dry wit, as well as his political conviction in support of workers.  Beyond the politics, however, much of the appeal of the book lies in its description of Orwell's nearly four months at the Aragon front--a short time, to be sure, but one suspects that any time spent at a battle front is long enough to allow authoritative retelling beyond the ability of the non-combatant to imagine.  (And in this regard, it was a good decision to move the two Appendices to the end of the book, rather than to leave them in their original location, as their detailed discussion of the political infighting would only have disrupted the narrative.)<br /><br />For the short time Orwell was at the front, the enemy was really boredom, vermin, and cold.  The Fascists were hardly a factor, though on the rare occasions when he was in a firefight the danger was real enough.  And his time at the front was long enough, and the danger real enough, for Orwell to get shot through the throat in May 1937, leading to one of several moments of understated humor in the book.  He writes that during treatment and recovery, \\"no one I met . . . failed to assure me that a man who is hit through the neck and survives is the luckiest creature alive.  I could not help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.\\"  What Orwell is most impressed with is the vision of equality held by--and for a time, in the militias, realized by--the Spanish fighters of the Left with whom he served.  And despite the degradation in the war itself and a degree of personal disillusionment, Orwell never ceases to be impressed by the character of Spaniards, even when he sometimes throws up his arms in despair at Spain itself.  When a train he was on after being wounded was rerouted from Barcelona (where Orwell's wife was, to whom he had sent a wire informing her that he was on his way) to Tarragona with no notice, Orwell writes: \\"I suppose the engine-driver had changes his mind.  `Just like Spain!' I thought.  But it was very Spanish, too, that they agreed to hold up the train while I sent another wire, and more Spanish still that the wire never got there.\\"  He writes elsewhere of the \\"flashes of magnanimity that you get from Spaniards in the worst of circumstances.  I have the most evil memories of Spain, but I have very few bad memories of Spaniards.\\"<br /><br />Orwell went to Spain to fight Fascism, but he became dismayed by the infighting among the various anti-Fascist forces.  Despite their ostensible unity against the Fascists, Spain's Communists, Anarchists, and various anti-Soviet Marxists (the group Orwell joined, though as much by circumstance as by conscious choice) were not able to forge a lasting unified front.  The infighting, particularly in Barcelona, and the suppression of the group to which Orwell had become attached, meant that he had to leave or face likely arrest.  He reserves some of his most severe criticism not for any of the various groups in Spain, but for journalists and politicians of other countries (notably his own) who, out of fear of a truly revolutionary workers' uprising, threw the weight of their opinions and their propaganda behind the Communists, in the process overlooking the real complexity of the situation and painting at least some other members of the Left as a pro-Fascist fifth column.  Orwell disputes this claim, based on his own experience and his conversations with other eyewitnesses.  Whatever the truth of the various claims about who was supporting whom, however, the larger truth seems to bea reaffirmation of the adage that truth is the first casualty in war.  While Orwell's account of his time in Spain leaves the reader with a very readable account of the experiences of an expatriate idealistically fighting against tyranny, his analysis of the politics of the situation leaves us with a lesson that is as true today as it was 75 years ago.  \\"The only hope is to keep political controversy on a plane where exhaustive discussion is possible.\\"

B008G59IKO|5.0|Since someone else did the grade rating, I think I'll do one too.<br /><br />B -See You Tonight - The intro threw me off a bit but if you keep listening, the song gets better.<br /><br />B -F$%& Time -  Very upbeat and something you can even dance too. (if you're really drunk) It's a silly song with a good amount of humor.<br /><br />A -Stop When The Red Lights Flash - Very catchy chorus and good beats throughout the song.<br /><br />A+ - Lazy Bones - The melody of this song is amazing. The lyrics are what you'd expect from Green Day, genius. Like the other reviewer said, one of the best.<br /><br />B+ -Wild One - Another gem in this album. If you liked songs like \\"She's a rebel\\" this is for you.<br /><br />C+ -Makeout Party - Upbeat,Catchy and punk. Guitar sounds great throughout. But there's just something with the lyrics that I think sounds off.<br /><br />A- -Stray Heart - One of the best songs, the rhythm of this song will want you to hit the \\"Replay\\" button all day.<br /><br />F-  -Ashley - Absolutely hated this track. The worse out of UNO and DOS.<br /><br />B- -Baby Eyes - Starts off good but the rhythm stays the same almost throughout, Makes you doze off a bit.<br /><br />B+ -Lady Cobra - Great song, But could be better, Lyrics are good but the melody of the song stays the same.<br /><br />A- -Nightlife - I liked this one. There is a lot of talk about this song and I think it's nice to have something different. It's not the typical Green Day and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />A -Wow! That's Loud - The intro is an instant attention catcher. Listen to it a few times and you'll be singing it all day.<br /><br />A+ -Amy - My favorite of all. This will easily become a classic. It's a beautifully written song, and if your name is Amy, Lucky you.

In this story as in his others, he is addressing an issue, which makes it more meaningful.  Good read.

B0085RQLXK|2.0|It's been eleven years since the last Aerosmith studio album, 2001's Just Push Play (and there's also been the 2004 covers album Honkin' On Bobo) which was really a product of its time with the band collaborating with producers that gave them a clean modern pop sound. This time around they brought back producer Jack Douglas who worked on some of the band's best albums in the 1970's. With the inner problems in the band and the near breakup, Steven Tyler doing American Idol fans were beginning to wonder if there was any recording going. It took a long time but Aerosmith's 15th studio album, Music From Another Dimension is here. Initially the band said it would be a throwback to Toys in the Attics (1975) and Rocks (1976) and there are glimpses of that, but there's also glimpses of the 80's and 90's Aerosmith too and a LOT of ballads. It's as if all eras of the band are blended in one album and that's their sound in 2012.  I got to hand it to them, for a band of men in their 60's there's some pretty rocking material here, and I find that the band does vocals harmonies quite a lot this time around(actually they sound like they wouldn't be out of place on a Def Leppard album). There's some good but to me it's an overall underwhelming Aerosmith album.<br /><br />The ups with MFAD are the strong rock track. In fact the album starts off rather with a string of three solid rock songs. \\"LUV XXX\\" starts out with a spoken intro before kicking it into high gear, I wish the entire album was like this, it's genuinely one of the best Aerosmith songs that's been done since the 1970's. It has that vibe from Toys/Rock era and it's fantastic. \\"Beautiful\\" is commercial Aerosmith at its best, it's catchy, the vocal harmonies are excellent and the songs is very likeable as a whole. \\" Legendary Cild\\"  is a Grip a Grip era song that never saw the light of day. I was intrigued at first and when I listened to it I thought to myself \\"this could work\\", and it does it rocks and it's catchy enough I really like this one. \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" with Carrie Underwood is puzzling, having her on an Aerosmith album is obviously not going to well with some of the fans and it's just not that good of a duet. \\"This Could Have Been Love\\" was chosen as the single and no surprise, it's a ballad.  I actually like this one, even if it's a 1990's Aero ballad rehash sounding or cheesy or sappy, I can acknowledge all of this but it still works for what is. \\"Street Jesus\\" has more of a classic rock edge to it, with even some jamming parts and the result is a longer, more vintage sounding track that works fairly well, it's one of those the hardcore fans will enjoy the most. The Joe Perry sung track \\"Freedom Fighter\\" is one of the best songs on this album for me, it's got a good Perry riff and even thought his voice isn't particularly great the song manages to rocks. \\"Another Last Goodbye\\" is a fitting ballad to end the album, it's a good one but it's overshadowed by the fact that there are too many ballads on MFAD to truly stand out.<br /><br />The first half of the album, I have generally good things to say about and it sounds promising and it makes you think that yes, maybe Aerosmith has some of the old rock sound we love back and it's going to be an entire album like this. Then there's the second side, filled with ballads and it really breaks the album's flow. A big part of the problem is that the album suffers from the too much ballads syndrome that was present on albums like Get A Grip, and they sound mostly like 1990's Aerosmith ballads. Six/seven (depending on who you ask) ballads on an album is just too much, and I like ballads but these are for the most part just sappy and rehashed songs that they've already done, except not as good or passionate. There's just no overlooking that many ballads is overkill. The worst part is a duet with Carrie Underwood, no offense but what's she doing on an Aerosmith album? Especially one which was reported as \\"back to their roots\\".I found some of the lyrics here to be the band's most juvenile yet, which is rather humorous coming from men in their sixties. Then again the album has 15 tracks, maybe a little too much and if they removed some of the ballads and Diane Warren songs (still using outside writers it seems) it would have come across as a tighter effort, it comes across as a modern version of Get A Grip (some good rock songs, plenty of ballads and it has over 14 songs and an outtake from that album as well) . Most of those ballads sound like they're trying to be part II of \\"Amazing\\", \\"Crying\\" or \\"Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\\". 15 songs may just be a little too much, if they cut some of it down it would have made for a shorter, tighter more Rock album, that's my take on it.<br /><br />Like many fans, it's hard for me to hide my disappointment. Still better than Just Push Play that's for sure, but I expected more from the hype Aerosmith had around this release. There are things to like but there's some that bring down the experience ultimately. I listened to it a few times by now and I can honestly say my rating is a 2 ½ out of 5. Some of the Rock tracks are reminiscent of classic Aerosmith and energy charged tunes but overall it comes off as an album that didn't know what direction it wanted to take. There have been some great releases by Classic bands this year, but sadly Aerosmith's is not one of them I'm afraid.I found some of the lyrics here to be the band's most juvenile yet, which is rather humorous coming from men in their sixties.

B0041KVZ1S|5.0|\\"Let It Be' may be most raw, genuine Beatles album in their catalog.  For me it has some of their most moving, emotional songs. These songs convey their great love for the band and each other, even as they were suffering inner turmoil and splintering apart.  \\"Let It Be\\" while beautifully recorded is not a studio masterpeice like \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt Pepper\\".  Having said that, this Vinyl remaster is a beautiful revelation.<br /><br />I have read the unfortunate Box Set reviews, reporting the many pressing issues customers have encountered.  While \\"Let It Be\\" is not the most pristine pressing I would have hoped for, sonically it is very impressive.  The main issue with my pressing is on one song, \\"Two Of Us\\", where there is an obvious blurt of distortion, followed by some of other strange blurt near a quiet bit near the end of the song, which REALLY SUCKS!!!  I can actually see the 'string of pearls' pattern on the vinyl in that spot.  Other than that, the album is generally quiet, with very little discernable surface noise.<br /><br />I really don't have anything to compare it to, other than the 1980's CD's and the tracks that appear on my 'Blue Album' vinyl.  I have a fairly descent turntable, a REGA P1, with a Sumiko Blue Point cartridge.  It was quite moving to hear \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" in all it's gorgeous analog beauty.  To my ears, it sounds warmer, richer and more natural than any other version of 'Let It Be' Ive ever heard.  I love it!!  It's almost like hearing the album for the first time.<br /><br />Judging from the Box Set reviews, I feel the pressing plant generally dropped the ball on this first batch of records.  What a shame, after all the hype and expectation.  Hopefully there will be subsequent pressings that improve on the quality control.  I also have Rubber Soul and Magical Mystery Tour.  My pressing of Rubber Soul is flawless and pristine.  MMT has very slight surface noise, mostly heard between tracks.  The music on both are dynamic and wonderful.  \\"Stawberry Feilds\\" blew me away!<br /><br />Hopefully the backlash, bad reviews and thousands of returned vinyls will prompt these pressing plants to bring their 'A' game when pressing the next round of Beatle records.  The music is THERE, they just need to put a little more love, attention and detail into getting the records as good as they can be.  It can be done.

B0041KW076|5.0|The Beatles on their early albums sound like they were having a lot of fun!  This album conveys that raw, energetic vibe, while giving us a virtual greatest hits playlist of classic Beatle tracks.  I've heard this album countless times, but never have I heard these songs come alive like they do on this excellent vinyl remaster.  What a great recording!!<br /><br />I have bought 4 of the new vinyls so far, and this is by far the best sounding of the 4.  There seems to be no issue with the actual pressing and surface noise is minimal and only heard between tracks.  I have read the many unfortunate (Box Set) reviews of pressing issues with the various vinyls.  I have a few minor issues with 2 of the albums I bought (MMT and Let It Be).  These albums are not as good as they could have been, and definitely didn't live up to the lengthy article posted on Amazon, touting the meticulous and painstaking process they went through to produce them. Hopefully the pressing plant will correct these mistakes on the 2nd run.  However, it sounds like I got lucky with this one.  This is the Beatles in all their brilliant analog glory, the way it was meant to be heard!<br /><br />This album benefits from just the perfect amount of reverb and atmosphere. That approach was later replaced by a punchier, drier sound on records like 'Rubber Soul' and 'Revolver'.  To hear this album on vinyl for the first time (only having the 1980's CD's to compare) is a revelation!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|My geek-gasms were many and my nerd-spurts profuse as I lost sleep and immensely enjoyed Cline's homage to 80's geek culture which many of us immersed ourselves in as a means of avoiding the bullies and forgetting our 70's wracked childhoods.<br /><br />Sure, there's the few reviewers who simply couldn't suspend their disbelief and enjoy this enthralling original concoction of a well explored genre which easily trumped any slight sense of an obvious ending. An ending I wouldn't have any other way. Indeed there are, perhaps, tired tropes involved yet I remained on the edge of my seat, bereft of jaded skepticism and ego charged snide criticism as I was fueled by Cline's infectious passion. I cared about the characters. I reveled in the journey. I savored the adventure and smiled a LOT. The story came to life in my mind's eye and I felt connected to it. Even better was the instances of, what to me seemed to be, some very original ideas which I will not spoil here.<br /><br />As Gaiman displayed when Morpheus challenged Choronzon to regain his lost helm, Hope trumped destruction and the ending had me smiling warmly as I wished it had been twice as long.<br /><br />Thanks Ernie!

B0053O89XI|5.0|I love Big Bang Theory Season 5 , the show is very, very funny. Everyone should buy it and watch it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|An incredibly moving novel which will be enjoyed by adults and teens. I was sorry to finish it and look forward to reading more from Gayle Forman.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|his simple little game is addicting but so fun as well you can fly through the levels pretty quick. Good thing they had quit a few to go through.
0525953728|5.0|I couldn't put it down. What can I say. This is a very good read and the first book I've ever read in 1 day. As a former grunt, it was very interesting as to how special these guys are and the equipment they have.
0385344333|5.0|Just because I see some negative reviews, I have to say I thought this was the best Reacher book Lee Child has done in a while.<br />  There's little left to add to existing reviews, other than my vote for being a fantastic read. Child gets special praise, tho, for his depiction of the  bleak landscape, all without obvious adjectives and description.<br />  The action, of course, was nonstop. Even in the car, there as enough going on to hold my interest, and that's saying a lot.<br />  Someone complained Reacher \\"threatened\\" a child. What a stretch! What he did would hardly count as a threat, and the comment was well-deserved---and worked.<br />  I did find it a little confusing---regarding which side various characters were on near the end-- for a bit, and had to go back for some closer reading, but that was more a factor of my speeding through, as I tend to do with these books.<br />  The biggest stretch, IMHO, was the communication system with the blinking. But hey, we all know Reacher is Superman in disguise, so if anyone can figure it out, he can.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|my 4 year old grandson loves bad piggies.  It allows him to try and build a machine that will carry piggie to the end of his course.  He is so proud when piggie crosses the finish line.  As an adult, thumbs down.  Not for me.  I just want to fling the birds across the screen, not build things!
B00000DGRX|5.0|Esta compra a sido increible, deep purple me encanta y en este disco esta plasmado uno de sus mejores trabajos, es una muy buena y valiosa compra.<br /><br />Saludos from peru
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|The Bottom Line:  Anyone saying this is as good as the debut album is nuts.  Here are the pluses of this album:  The music is top-notch!  The band is as musically talented as they've ever been.  The music is great!  The volcals are still very good.  Wetton doesn't sound like an old, washed out Steve Walsh from Kansas.  He sounds great.  My hang up with this album is the lyrics.  Most of the songs are down-right depressing, atheist, and negative.  It's like there was some kind of anti-God agenda with writing the songs on this album.  It makes it hard to appreciate everything else.
B008458O3S|4.0|I downloaded this because of the little guy in my life who looooves trains. He will be over the moon about it, I'm sure. I tried it out to make sure it isn't lame, and actually, I've been having fun with it. It's very easy to draw and erase track. It's great that you can slow down or speed up the trains. The tutorial is great. So far it's pretty easy but a lot of games are deceptively so at the beginning. Maybe the difficulty will raise to an adult level, not sure. Another cool detail the developers thought of is the ability to change players. I was going to delete my progress so said little guy could start fresh, but kinda didn't want to. Nice that they thought of that. :)
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is a great visual movie.  I had a friend of mine call it Dances with Wolves in Blue.  Even though the storyline is similar, the visual effects are outstanding here.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" features a complicated plot, multiple story lines that intersect, and is epic in scope and size. This could be a joy to behold for some, or a confused mess for others and as such, audiences were unsure if \\"Cloud Atlas\\" was worth the time, money or effort to watch.<br /><br />The failure of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" and its reported $100 million budget, could mean other studios to be wary of other challenging big budget sci-fi movies that, while rewarding, may be a dud at the box office. For studios who want to make money, that might mean taking less risks or hedging their bets and producing challenging movies but with much smaller budgets.<br /><br />Could some of Cloud Atlas's near-three-hour running time have been cut? Probably. Might a few of the more tangential storylines been trimmed? Sure. But the filmmakers clearly approached this project with the feeling that more is more: in the same way that a single poppy, though beautiful and perfect in its own right, cannot compare to the overwhelming beauty of an entire field, the telling of the same story in six different ways amplifies its nuances. I was never bored, and for the most part I was throroughly engaged, be it in a Streets of San Francisco-style car chase and shootout, a campy Great Escape-style breakout staged by pensioners, or a futuristic nightmare where all of society willingly lives within a CGI fantasy. Themes of cannibalism (both pysical and intellectual) and corporate greed are balanced by moments of healing, generosity, and kindness.<br /><br />Like the passengers on Adam Ewing's ship home, the sprawling cast of characters constantly struggles to find its footing as the deck pitches beneath them. Some do better than others, but each tale brims with hope for a kinder present and a better future. Whether you love Cloud Atlas or hate it (I suspect most viewers will land somewhere between \\"frustrated\\" and \\"impressed\\"), I think there are far worse ways to spend your three hours than considering the same.<br /><br />Some will find \\"Cloud Atlas\\" mentally exhausting, slow, or just plain distracting with its use and reuse of the same actors across the centuries. Since the bulk of the cast, led by Tom Hanks and Halle Berry (featuring Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon, Jim Sturgess, and Jim Broadbent), appear as different characters through the span of the movie, undoubtedly, people will find themselves playing \\"find the celebrity\\". But, the film is packed with more than just great production values, character design, costumes and prosthetic make-up awesomeness. The film's underlying threads of consequence, human kindness and cruelty are timeless and speak to even larger themes about the meaning of life.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price of admission, don't wait to see \\"Cloud Atlas\\" until it releases on DVD and Blu Ray. A story this large deserves to be seen on the big screen. Anyhow I hope Warner Bros. will put out a Blu-Ray release to rival Lawrence of Arabia.
6305212112|5.0|As a woman who grew up in the south (Atlanta) in the 1960's and 1970's, this movie's female characters could have just been the neighbors when I was growing up. They felt that familiar to me. I have a habit of watching anything Jessica Tandy was in and it was fun seeing her here. Kathy Bates was just perfect for her role and I cheered when she smashed that car after those young fools stole her space. Her character's personal growth throughout was beautifully done and paralleled the growth of Mary-Louise Parker's role and Mary Stuart Masterson's role as well. The movie is full of warmth, personal growth, and truth about life. There are rough and ugly things- hunger, racism, domestic violence, sexism, death, and a child losing an arm-but they are handled in such sensitive ways. There is a lot of humor to season the story and above all, it is a story about women in the South, women everywhere, and the connections we make with one another, with family, friends, children, and our communities. I recommend this movie to everyone.<br /><br />An added bonus is the extra scenes. These scenes were filmed as part of the movie but deleted when shown in the theater due to time constraints. They are now restored to the movie where they belong and viewers can see the movie as it was meant to be. Some people apparently don't understand that these scenes were part of the movie and it was only time limits that lopped part of the movie off. Be glad you can see the real movie as it was intended. You get more Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker- and that is a very good thing!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Money was a little tight for me so I opted to not attend the show. I had attended several of her other concerts over the years though. Sticky & Sweet is an incredible show. It's really hard to compare this to her other concert tours as each one has something different representing a different point in time of her career.<br /><br />The DVD is incredibly well-shot offering a near-perfect view of the show. The audio is very good too. It seems some of the audio has been corrected in the studio to give a more even feel (perhaps to correct any off notes or something of that nature). It's almost as good as being there, though nothing compares to the magic of the actual experience of being there.<br /><br />\\"Vogue\\", \\"She's Not Me\\", \\"Music 2008\\", \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", the two Evita songs, and \\"Like A Prayer\\" are some of my favorite performances even though I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />The accompanying CD is a nice addition featuring just some of the songs as they appear in the DVD.<br /><br />This is a must-have for any Madonna concert enthusiasts.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good read. Not sure what all the<br />hassel is about secrets being revealed,have read other books that tell the same stuff. I liked the book, at least now I have an idea what probably really happened.Sounds like we could have taken him down sooner, but had to wait. Will be interesting to see how it compares to the movie backed by the WH in December.
0307730697|5.0|Our friend is 72 was a Marine.  After hearing the Author talk about the Book, we knew he would like it.  We were right, he really enjoyed the box, finished it in 3 days.  He said it was an uplifting book.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Great album I am a new maroon 5 fan and wow i was missing out all this year.. i love every single song from beginning to end
B008MG1E4A|3.0|More of a narrative, than a written account of the event.  A good read to understand the danger our troops endure and the dedication with which they serve. As good of a story as any novel.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I do quite a bit of editing; text, photo and video. Old computers could handle text with adequate speed, but photo editing takes time and videos mega-time. This processor is fast with the photos and handles videos well. It is nice to have the integrated, video &#34;board&#34; in the processor. I plugged in a PNY video board that I like, the integrated video shut down and the PNY seemed slower, so I removed the PNY.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This was a birthday gift for a very, very difficult to buy for husband.  He loved it!  The movie arrived quickly and was packaged well.  No problems at all.
0553386794|5.0|Such an amazing book!!!!!!! I just got sucked into the world of Westeros and fascinated with all the characters. I would recommend it to anyone that loves Fantasy-Fiction books!!!! 5/5
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I like this book. It is very entertaining. I do have to say that the repetitive words/phrases the author uses gets annoying. That's really my only complaint. But I'll definitely check out the next book.
B008NW67E0|5.0|i cannot stop listening to this very lyrical, thoughtful, precise and melodic piece of music.  Each song begs for a closer listen....with each listen a new discovery.  OUTSTANDING!  Even better than the first cd.
B0061S073A|4.0|I and my 3 year old love this. The only thing that I wish were different is that I could put her children's books that are on my Kindle into Kids Place for her to look at.
B007L24T52|4.0|Another great read by Baldacci. Keeps you in suspense throughout the whole book. How is Robie involved? Why is Robie  involved? Who is the real target? Smashing good read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. I get so many project ideas for the house. I love being able to see variations in everybody else's ideas. This is an amazing site and I'm glad my friend shared it with me.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|we'll honestly I love help Kitty she is too cuute .the game is really fun just a little challenging. I recommend it for you.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is amazing its so fun I play it so much I cant put it down that what I think about it
0316187216|5.0|Nobody chews tobacco, quotes the Bible (except obliquely), or packs a Colt Dragoon, but otherwise there is a really sweet Western snuggled in this latest installment of Abercrombie's fantasy series.  His wry, ironic dialog would not be out of place in a conventional cowboys-and-indians tale, and it would be a lot better than most, besides.  And it is wonderful to see our favorite nine-fingered berserker back in the saddle, so to speak.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Outstanding raw energy in this. Each musician gave a full-tilt display of really great musiciansip. The operatic style really enhanced it too. I saw this CD promoted a while & I finally bought it & boy, I'm glad I did!
0316044695|3.0|I looked fwd to this book. Unfortunately the writing is sub par despite the heroic story. I felt that WAR and Matterhorn were superb 5 star books by comparison.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|In my opinion this movie was wonderful.  The music, the artwork, and the characters were lovely.  The storyline was fluid and shows just what hasty decisions can do to the person and the people around them.  The girl was \\"brave\\" in many aspects and I liked how strong in heart she was. I can not think of one thing I did not like about this movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is a gripping read! The characters and plot are so well laid out and there are so many twists in the story that I just could not put this book down. I haven't read a John Grisham book in a long time but this one is a must!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game! it is so fun and totally addictive! easy to play and fun for all ages. highly recommend
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|Its difficult to describe this show. I usually don't like \\"Horror\\"-Shows/Movies but it wasn't so much Horror as I expected. Of course, it contains any shockers but the show is more a Drama packed with/about Ghosts and a few horror elements.<br /><br />Its a interesting Show with very good actors: Dylan McDermott, Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Evan Peters and as guests we see Matt Ross, Lily Rabe,  Zachary Quinto, Teddy Sears, Christine Estabrook, Frances Conroy, Dennis O'Hare and as uncredited part as the \\"Rubberman\\" Riley Schmidt.<br /><br />Yes, the show its a bit different of others and a bit disturbing but interesting and very well made.<br /><br />The BLU-RAY (Regional CODE: A) : CONTAINS VERY GOOD PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND.<br /><br />The Show contains english subtitles but not the bonus-features which are interesting.<br /><br />P.S: the second season has the same actors (Zachary Quinto gets a leading part) but tells a another/different story.
B003Y059EK|1.0|Watched it with my children.  Freaked out even my teenagers.  Younger kids were sitting there with freaked out looks on there faces.  I was thinking why are we still watching this \\"Disney\\" movie.  Waste!
B0086700CM|4.0|Very fun. I played Temple Run on my friends Kindle but I cant download it for some reason. Really irritating.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it is ok it doesn't have parentheses but for the math I am doing (8th grade) it works besides if you really need the parentheses to do your math and you cant put it in order yourself you are in the wrong math class (Ps it does have a &radic; button
B008D28HYS|5.0|My husband says this takes up too much of my time...  I started playing the original one and then noticed it was available in color!!  OMG I can't put it down. I finished them all and now I check everyday to see if there are more puzzles added.  I love it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great story. May be a little familiar but definitely worth the read,  it's a trilogy also. Buy second book and third comes out in 2013!!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|this book is just like the other books rick has writen. i love this book! i read this book tell it was way past my bedtime.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! Susan did a fabulous job on this album! I especially love \\"Memory\\" and \\"Bring Him Home\\"!
0525953728|5.0|I purchased this book, &#34;No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden,&#34; as a gift for a friend. He very much enjoyed this book.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|This is my go-to music for cleaning and working out.  She get's more amazing over time.  Simply a must have.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This music cd was way better than what we anticipated ! Great mix of Cash songs. If you are a Johnny Cash lover...this cd is a must have.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Best books ever. Just wish there was more on the new life of ana and Christian with the children. So good.
B006OAB2XO|4.0|Wikipedia quotes a description of Claire Boucher, the creator behind Grimes, as being the \\"love child of Aphex Twin and ABBA,\\" and that sounds about right to me. Grimes' new album, Visions, is pure electronic froth -- but it is most delightful froth! Song after song pulsates with interesting rhythms and odd melodies. Boucher's falsetto alternates between angelically eerie and 60s girl-group, and the lyrics can be difficult to delineate at times. But it hardly matters. These are dance tracks for Tim Burton. Best tracks are \\"Circumambient\\" and \\"Be a Body,\\" as well as the anime-sounding \\"Genesis,\\" and sinuously gorgeous \\"Skin.\\" (Note: Official YouTube videos of Grimes songs, on this and other albums, are fascinating to watch.)
B009NOVCTM|5.0|what can you say about the stones that hasn't already been said? They are the greatest, most influential band ever. Zeppelin, the who,queen, even the beatles have learned from them. And these songs each iconic in their own way show why. Long live mick, keith, charlie and ronnie!!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|First of all, if you are a Dylan fan, then you are going to love Tempest. There is plenty of material here reminding your brain why you like the cool, intellectual, Dylan. There are not any screaming guitars; but the music does have a slow rhythm, the lyrics paint a picture and have a purpose. Among the offerings of Tempest, there is a 12 minute song about the sinking Titanic, and a tribute song to John Lennon. A Dylan fan will love it!
0061547832|3.0|real bullhead! not really interesing... does not get my interest up.... sorry... he is into himself big time. too bullish
