B000JMKTLO|4.0|It's hard to beat 'GoneGirl'. This was very easy to get into and hard to put down.  It just wasn't as shocking or thought provoking as' Gone Girl.'
B001L83PLQ|5.0|The families in this story go through the wrenching changes of survival in a troubled time when many do not survive the bombs, shootings, starvation, diseases.  There is romance and family honor woven through, with tension between those who have made it into the upper crust world designed by the British, and close family members in the remote villages living the old way without plumbing, electric, vehicles but sharing all that they have to help each other survive.  Beautifully written, sad and heart warming.  I feel I know these people and think of them still wondering how they are doing now.
1476733953|5.0|I'd never heard of this book until I read the reviews here on Amazon, but I'm so glad I took a chance on it. This is science fiction done right, with intriguing ideas, compelling characters and enough tension and action to keep you reading late into the night. An excellent book and a mesmerizing read that'll stay with you for days after you finish it. I hope there's more to the story some day. Highly recommended.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I can see why this should be read and discussed with others. I am looking forward to further evaluations with friends. Has my mind wonder about families, would recommend to others
1781162646|5.0|... Will wonders never cease?<br />&#34;Joyland&#34; is a mix of scary stuff and crime stuff, all wrapped around a coming of age story set in a 1970s amusement park. It's a fast read and an enjoyable one. And it's fun to be able to finish a King novel in two days or less. :)
B00AR83PN4|1.0|The controls left something wanting, and the game lost it's appeal quickly. I would be best used on a tablet and not a phone (as was my case).
0061122416|3.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but after reading so many glowing reviews I thought maybe it would be transcendent. Instead, it's a less effective, Christianized version of &#34;The Little Prince&#34; or &#34;Jonathan Livingston Seagull.&#34; I kept waiting for the moments of wonder that are inspired by Little Prince, but they never came.<br />It's not a bad book. It just wasn't the life-changing read I expected. I can't really recommend it except to people who've never experienced truly transcendent works.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've already bought this as gifts for friends. Get it. Read it. Use it. Recommend it. Give it. Read it again!
098478280X|1.0|I like first and the forth edition more than this edition.<br />1. Most of the programs are solved in Java. Would love to have C++ implementation for same.<br />2. It is difficult to use the book, would prefer to have ecopy of the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Enjoy following the family through their everyday lives and how history has its impact on their outlook on the world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!! I haven't played it in a while because when I do it's hard for me to stop!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Excellent read, well paced, kept me totally engrossed from beginning to end.  Recommend to all who have enjoyed Rebus in previous novels.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Well done with fab costuming.  Well directed, very solid talent and acting.  Scenery is out of this world.  Cant wait for the 3rd season!
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|definitely a great approach from a classic  movie , the effects are great !!!! a must to have if you are a collector
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As a lover of soaps this fills the bill for me with one exception we need close captioning ..other than that I am very pleased.  It makes being a Prime member something special
B00B935SUY|5.0|Love Dave Grohl. Love this movie. Very interesting and flows well, unlike other music documentaries I have watched. Only wish they had been able to interview RHCP too!
0553801473|5.0|I waited and waited and waited for this book, only to discover that there will be another!<br />A great series by George R Martin with some very non-traditional twists, turns and subplots - very well done!
B00B23Z2IE|5.0|CD arrived promptly and I love it.  I wasn't familiar with Charles Bradley but heard this CD on a radio and ordered it.  Then I ordered one for my old man.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Easy to put on and attach, but I'd like a more secure way to attach it than the loop - if I'm in shallow water I don't need it and would worry about it floating away.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The love story is so deep! I love how Gideon and Eva help to heal each other. Can't wait to see when book 4 comes out.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|This greatly improves the functionality of the GP3 by allowing you to see what you're shooting, but it a huge battery hog!
0316077046|2.0|I had a really hard time with Beautiful Darkness. The writing is still lovely, but some other things really got in the way for me. The big one is the relationship. I know that Lena and Ethan are supposed to be eternal loves, but they are so bad for each other! I volunteer with youth and one thing I try to tell them is teenagerhood is for learning about yourself. If your romantic relationships are that stressful you need to walk away. It's hard, but it's worth it. The whole time I just wanted to go to Ethan and Lena and say something like this: \\"I know you love each other. That love is absolutely real. The problem is that you aren't ready for the pressure that your relationship is putting you through. If you really love each other you should step back a bit until Lena has worked through her crap and Ethan has learned to deal with a few things too.\\" Obviously that's not going to happen and they're going to continue to overcome amazing odds to be together, which is fine. It's that kind of book, and it's good at what it's trying to do. I'm going to try out the next one and hopefully I'll be able to put my grown up self aside.
B0000025JT|4.0|Used to have the vinyl but there was an ownership dispute, my sis said it was her's. Oh well, can't play vinyl anymore anyway my player bit the dust awhile ago. Would have given 5 stars if the lyrics were included, okay so I'm spoiled, too happy right now I have it again, I'm somebody else, lol.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Well written, very easy to get into & stay with the story line! I'm a western history fan. This is the first of Craigs books I've read, & if ya like a touch old cowboy & Indian belief, then this is the book for you!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This should be a required read if you have ever wondered \\"Who am I and why am I here?\\"  The only limits we have are the ones we pile upon ourselves.  Great read and thought provoking.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|The season was great! Don't really like the ending because it means the season is over! But I loved it!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|first season was awesome!! This one, not sure of yet. Only viewed episode 1 and 2.  Not great story line. Pretty horrible images though. Guess that works!!
B007885IJU|5.0|I liked this record and it is something anybody could easily enjoy. Even my mother liked it and she is picky!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This series, my first exposure, caught my interest immediately.  The plot development and character shaping was surprising and unexpected.  The political intrigue tempered by the power of money and sex were at the fore.  The more you see, the more you want to know.  I am left hoping the greater good will be served at this high level of governing... but, the very struggle between right and wrong and strength vs. power keeps this story exciting.  I know how I hope this should resolve, but I also know I should expect to be completely shocked.  Excellent.
B009VTAGD2|5.0|I absolutely positively adore this album. My favorite songs are Love Hurts and Dig. The entire record is phenomenal and having it in vinyl makes it tangible.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Great classic movie to have even as an adult. This is a great extended edition to have to any movie collection!
0694003611|5.0|I just didn't know why so many people loved this book, until I started reading it to my 16 months old girl ,she just love it ,and can't sleep without it ..she loves the old lady whispering hush and says hush ..it's just great and a must have ,but now she is 19 month she still love it but it doesn't have the same effect like she would just go back to sleep when I say good night moon ...maybe she bcuz she doesn't have many books ,but still do love n I'm too :D
B008XM3NZQ|5.0|Worth bung re mastered copy on blu ray! Seems like they re shot every scene with clean shots. Just wish I got digital copy that was suppose to be in order.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Good build, charges very fast comparing to charging via usb port. Easy attach and detach. No damage to cable or ports if device is accidentally moved when being charged. Excellent accessory. Highly recommended.
B00466HN72|5.0|Great movie to have even for an adult. Has humor that adults get, not kids may not. A must have.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I  loved it can't wait for the next  season to start. Couldn't stop watching it  I was drawn into it
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I liked tris as far as zombie movies go. It had a strong plot and made some philosophical points. Zombies can change and feel love, is there still hope for us?
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love this game it is so much fun l loves it a lot it is not a rip off  if it was l would not be doing this game review<br />Minecraft rules
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I have played Mahjong on the computer for years, but this I really like.  It has many different puzzles to choose from and the time just flies by while I am playing this game.  I would recommend it for anyone who like Mahjong.
1451695195|5.0|I would highly recommend this book - especially if you have lost someone close, as I have recently lost my beautiful young husband. It offers a sense of peace and hope that your loved one is in God's home where there is no more pain or sorrow.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|I really like that this gives you an hour by hour forecast and so far it has been right on the mark.  It is very easy to understand and read.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased this because we were going on a cruise and wanted to be able to offload each day's photos from our cameras to the iPad that we left on the ship. We took the memory cards out each day and loaded them into this and the pictures saved to the iPad just fine!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Not sure what this app is suppose to do because each time I use it I get a message that says I need to activate the speaking device.  That is not really what I wanted.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Seriously.......not much to say...................it works and lets me charge while wking on the computer<br /><br />I keep it by the computer and never have to chase down a plug in a hurry, just plug and go
B00BKBCF38|5.0|....If not better. I was skeptical of this album at first after reading some scathing reviews, but I tried it anyways, and I'm glad to say that I was wrong with any assumptions that may have been made when reading said reviews.<br /><br />At first, it starts out with a short instrumental intro, with the usual organs and various synthesizer's that is to be expected from Ghost. Not a bad beginning, but nothing spectacular. Then comes the next track; \\"Per Aspera Ad Inferni\\", and it starts off with a heavy guitar riff, and then picks up to a mild vocal part. The best part by far, however is the chorus, which includes the singer chanting the song title, along with other members of the band. Definitely a catchy way to end a song.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite song on the album starts next; \\"Secular Haze.\\" I don't care if it has a damn carnival organ in it; it's Ghost. They can do whatever they want to make it sound that much more awesome. Again, the singer, (Papa Emeritus II, same guy as before, just with a different stage name,) really shines through his parts. Normally, I'm not a big fan of cleaner vocals when it comes to music, but he really adds a haunting, yet beautiful voice at the same time to the songs.<br /><br />The first half, (give or take) of the album is absolutely killer. Towards the end of it, however, it doesn't have as strong tracks. But the first tracks are just so great that I don't care. Even the latter tracks are still good; they're just not AS good. (With maybe, the exception of the final track, Monstrance Clock.) Monstrance Clock has one of the most Haunting, awesome, epic endings I've heard in a long time. It's such a simple melody, yet it sounds like so much more. I can't emphasis on how awesome it really is. The two added bonus tracks, \\"La Mantra Mori\\" and \\"I'm a Marionette\\", (An ABBA cover,) are great as well.<br /><br />All in all, an absolute GREAT addition to the Ghost collection. With only two albums out, I cannot WAIT to see what else they have up their sleeves, (Or rather, their robes.)<br /><br />Oh, and....<br /><br />♫ Come together<br /> Together as One<br /> Come Together<br /> For Lucifer's son ♫
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|It's like Bruce isn't even trying. You can almost hear him between takes asking &#34;Hey, can I have my money now?&#34; The last one was bad, this one was even worse. Don't waste your time.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Loved the movies and can't get enough of this game,  you'll get  hooked right away and won't be able to turn it off. Get lost in the game imagining your real life Jurassic park builder.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Was a bit disappointed that the Amazon version has not been updated to include the Zen Garden like the recent Google Playstore update. Also noticed lagging with typing and other programs on my phone after I installed it and the Amazon App Store application. Don't know which is to blame, but will uninstall both if I continue to experience problems. Once it is updated and other issues with my phone are resolved, I may give it 5 stars.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Loved this movie; great characters; great story; suspense.  A movie that will really hold your attention.  If you like Ben Affleck -- don't pass on this one.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Really well done, honest portrayal of the greatest band of all times! Full of wonderful music, interviews, etc. Definitely a must-see if you like the Eagles!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a pretty good game for kids!  Not too challenging early on in gameplay and cute graphics make it fun!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A brilliant new emotionally compelling story from Gaiman.  It's easy to empathize with the narrator of the novel, and though you will know the basic outcome from the start of book, the suspense will make you want to finish it in one sitting.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|just a lame movie altogether,,,I would have preferred to have a root canal than watch this again,, so,, have fun
B0011XBLUS|5.0|My son watched the movie and fell in love with the music.  This sound track is authentic to the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I LOVE Gideon and fell even further for him in this book! I cannot wait for the remaining two books and would be thrilled if there were 10 more!! I do have to admit though that this was my least favorite of the three.... Every time I thought I knew where the book was heading ...the story never developed. Hoping the next two have the suspense and excitement that I know Gideon and Eva bring to the books ...along with some tremendous passion as well!!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|What can I say?  It's Castle.  I enjoy this series because it reminds me of romantic mystery series like McMillan and Wife and Hart to Hart.  Castle has an up-to-date modern edge to it and a fun roll reversal. What's not to like?
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I didn't realize that the Miyazaki movie was based inn a book until I saw this in the kindle store. The story has all the charm you would expect, plus some, a truly charming little read.<br /><br />This is definitely the next bedtime story for me and my son.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I really like it,but it's about tree weeks old and the stand is already weak so I don't know how long it's going to last it has calapsted already two times.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love accessing my shared files from my PC while on WiFi.  Its easy, and haven't had encountered any bugs whatsoever.
B000H5U832|1.0|When I got my DVD it was so scratched it wouldn't play it said like new condition but it was in horrible condition
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|A lot to do plenty to keep u busy for a long time ppl. Are real nice and helpful plus a couple maps to try plus lots of upgrades
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started this drama reluctantly because I wasn't sure about the first 2 episodes.  I hung in there and fell in love with the characters and am so glad Amazon offered Season 3.  It was captivating and I love the story line but am sad to lose 2 excellent actors/characters.  Yes, I recommend it highly.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love this group and their work.  The songs are easy to sing along with and the melodies are simple.  The words tell a real story that is probably true.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy seeing the various animals and the different kinds of habitats that are available.  I only wish the expansions didn't &#34;cost&#34; so many coins.
B00499NHLC|5.0|How could anybody not love anything with the beautiful Benedict in it.  Good story lines and plots don't hurt either.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I ordered this app for my granddaughter.  She has so much fun, designing the hairstyles and doing the coloring.  I am glad I could get it for her to enjoy when she comes to visit.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very interesting story lines.  It keeps you in suspense during the entire program.  I wish I had watched the series when it was on weekly but it's not too late now to see it all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I chose that I love this product, but I'm not happy that they killed off Matthew.  I wonder what the story is going to be now!!
B006X08FDA|5.0|I have always liked some bluegrass but this is great.  It has a lot of blues notes mixed with soul and ragtime.  I would love to see this group in person.
1400069289|5.0|This is a very interesting book.  It talks about several companies and gives insight into them.<br />What a great insight into the mind.
0061714402|5.0|i couldnt put this book down, i read the whole book in 1 night. It takes you in the head of dave mustaine and his incredible journey with metallica and his rockstar lifestyle. Great read
B00127RAJY|5.0|I admit that I hate working out. I've never, until now, really found a class or DVD series I actually kind of like to do. The 30-day Shred is fast paced and varied enough to keep me engaged and interested without growing bored of any one set of reps. I think the constant switching between upright and floor movements really helps. It's a butt-kicking workout. You are constantly moving - and before you know it, you're done! Highly recommended - even to those who hate working out. :-)
B003HOXLE8|5.0|This is my first book for Adobe and it was absolutely a easy book to pick up and go. There was no extra fluff in the chapters and the exercises are straight to the point  without being overly complicated. Wish I purchased this in college. I will definitely be purchasing another Adobe Class in a Book title soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting all the different villains are so funny and it funny what they say when they show up and when you beat them
B004QBWU02|4.0|This is a great movie.  The music was wonderful, & it was like going back in time.  My first comment that I entered was not so hot, since the copy played so dark that we couldn't see it.  However, when I called the supplier (Movie Mars, Inc.) they couldn't have been nicer.  Not only did they provide me with a mailing label to return it at no charge, they provided a new copy which was just fine.  it was also delivered before the promised date of delivery.!
B000I186FW|1.0|The main character speaks through a mask that they do not bother to dub through, making him very hard to understand. The story does not flow, with sequences added seemingly just to do so. Whole sections could be removed and the same story could be told. The action is ridiculous, the cinematography was Matrix leftovers and what dialogue you can hear was as if a junior high school child was writing it.<br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie would be to make sure not to make the mistake of watching such a pile of dung ever again. Sort of like smoking a whole pack of cigarettes to break you of wanting them ever again.<br /><br />Avoid with prejudice.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Every song is great, a good &#34;listen all the way through&#34; cd.  I especially loved the fact that this is a collaboration with other artists, so there are some new twists to some old favorites.
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|The blocks that came in the set are great, typical for Duplo. The animals are the SAME SIZE as the animals in the &#34;My First Zoo&#34; set, which is not what I expected as this set is called &#34;Baby Zoo&#34;... I expected baby animals, smaller than the My First Zoo set. They were the same. The animals have a seam through the middle, which isn't that bad and what do we really expect from small plastic block animals, but the seam is pretty noticeable and I worry it will get weak with use.
B001ED7C58|4.0|The case was cracked a little, but I had no intensions of keeping it in the first place. The CD itself was in great condition no scratches or scuffs of any kind. This was to complete my collection and so it did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some what challenging scenes but easy enough not to give you headache trying to figure out. Got harder the higher you go.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love the way it looks. I love the way it's set up. I just love it. So much better than my stock S3 keyboard.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|Yes it is a new album,sounds too much like digital instruments and hardly any good guitar solos I think I like one song.
B00A6CT012|4.0|There were really thoughtful ideas on how to slim down a home.  If a person were to employ all the ideas mentioned it would be a full time job.  Interesting read and a worthy goal to aim for.
B007N3206E|5.0|&#34;You see that saw were gonna start using it&#34;Tell your mf friends too.Nothing like getting beaten alive with some baseball bats.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun, especially if you have friends to share pieces with. Achievable goals that gradually become more difficult is also a great draw.
B001A5HBAG|4.0|All in all,  I really enjoyed this.  First few eisodes are a bit slow as character development takes place,  but really picks up about half way through ending with a wow!  Can't wait to start season two.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|&#34;Still Alice&#34; is a moving tale about the devastating  affect Alzheimer's has on its victims and their families.<br />The rapid decline of Alice's condition is heart-breaking and alarming. I found my self crying at time. The repetition  seems necessarily to explain what was going with Alice.  I highly recommend that book.
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|Sigur Rós have always been creators of large expansive soundscapes. Their albums are places to explore, discovering new Icelandic islets and inlets with each listen. Kveikur though seems a much more immediate listen, especially the excellent opener Brennisteinn which is more distorted and dark than I was expecting, the title track is a belter too. I think Kveikur is a step forward for the band and I find my appetite is whetted for coming albums.<br /><br />Now, I always like to leave readers with a recommendation of a little gem they might not otherwise find. If you're a fan of Sigur Rós then you have to listen to a band called Takeda, trust me;)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a cool game .its like having a real horse. and all kinds of horses u could get.u get to make its food.feed him treats.groom it.and get things for it.
B005FITILO|5.0|Charlize Theron is one of the best actors working today. If you want to see someone at the top of their craft look no further that this movie. This is a very brave part for an actor because there is no redeeming solution. Director Ivan Reitman let the movie flow organically, some of it must be improvised. He uses the same deft hand that he used on Juno. Anothert great actor working today is Patton Oswalt. If you have not seen his work you are missing something. He continues to amaze. I have been lucky enough to follow the career of Diablo Cody from her writing here in Minneapolis to her Academy Award for Juno. She is a great talent and I can hardly wait for her next script. I know that this film was a hard sell, in that the main person is such a jerk, but don't miss it.<br />  &#34;That girl you hated in high school is 37&#34;
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Beautiful story.  I love my lab Leah and I do believe she understands  a lot more than I gave her credit for.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great Show, Great Season!  The writers and actors were able to keep this show great!  I can't wait till the next season is available!
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I first heard Jonathan & Charlotte on Youtube from their performances on Britain's Got Talent. Their audition of The Prayer was jaw dropping. It reminded me of The Prayer that was performed by Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion. They are absolutely amazing.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Riveting, exciting, and a nail-biting series.  I highly recommend it.  Season Two is great too!  The casting is excellent and quality acting!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Liked the movie, the action was good, the story line was easy to follow, but suggest children under 10 years not view it the witches were seen and viewed in a very evil way, the images would be to scary for children.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great with my Kindle fire.  I really like the longer cord too.  Great to have if you have a kindle fire.
B005R4KUZE|5.0|Love it. A great way to improve tactics, vision, and calculations skills. I wish I could enter my own blunders to use them as drills.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I downloaded this for my niece (she loves puzzles), &amp; it's awesome!  I know that she's going to LOVE it just as much as I do....
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie - at home with popcorn and ice cream.  Husband enjoyed the movie better than I did since he read the book.
1401322786|5.0|Amazing story about the man who followed by time to find two people who needed to understand the meaning of TIME.<br />I was impressed by the book i usually read about a week.But this book i finished in no time.<br />love it love it<br />i read every single  line and enjoyed the author's style. If someone would ask me is that true?i ll agree. Time rules:)and Rules of time rule us:)<br />paradox but life is what we call living.<br />i recommend the book
B004W1GCNC|4.0|While this is most certainly not Downton Abby, Upstairs Downstairs was a classic all in itself. I would recommend this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is a really good brainteaser. It has a fresh way of making you think your way out of problems and is interesting enough to completely absorb your attention. There are a few features that need to be added/changed for this app to be five star quality, however. There were several times I was completely stumped, and there is no hint button. There is also no game save, so if you start a level and exit the app be prepared to restart the level upon your return. Overall, this game is an excellent free addition to a game collection.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very addictive.  I like to try to make patterns with the suits....black red black red ....red red. black black .. it adds a degree of difficulty.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was a good book, but very hard to follow. Time frame skipped back and forth and it was difficult remembering relationships of the characters, especially on an e-reader. I would recommend having a pencil and paper handy to make a few notes of reference for anyone reading the book this way.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  After watching this movie, (at the theater) I was inspired to read the book, it fact, I read the whole Millennium series by Stieg Larsson and then ordered the DVD.  Great story line.
B00C061I3K|1.0|I cannot write a review because i'm still waiting for this cd. It was my last order to amazon.Because i'm not satisfied. I need the cd next w-e.So i have a problem.Thanks for nothing
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|This movie destroyed a beautiful movie.  The Scarecow, tinman and the Lion must be hoping the wicked witch will burn this film.  If you want to see monkeys go see Tarzan!!!
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Great kids movie with a good theme.  My nieces and nephews thoroughly enjoyed this movie - they are huge fans of Bridget Mendler.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I am still getting use to it. The display is great. I have not figured out how to connect the music.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I have to be truthful, i dont like this new version as i did the older one, please bring back the older version of amazon mobile
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of watching movies with killing, blowing stuff up, car chases and crashes. Especially when every other word beginners with an F.<br />This movie was a refreshing respite from all that type of entertainment. The actors were great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun I love despicable me. I had this on an iPhone and iPad and freaked out when it became available for Kindle!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Got a Blu ray player for my birthday and this was my first purchase! Absolutely love! I was given the British version which if you don't know, the sorcer's stone is actually called the philosopher's stone.  I was a little thrown off at first until i read the letter from the seller.  Getting the British version meant 3 discs of added features! Plus it's cooler because that's where the movies were made so it's more authentic.  The seller even said if you weren't happy with it he would exchange.  Love these!!!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|If you love the movie, or are a Cher and Christine fan, this is a great CD. It shows off their talents which are outstanding, and is fun if you are familiar with the movie and can remember the dance or staging scenes. It is certainly an enjoyable listen. I would definitely recommend
B00AAU7AI0|3.0|Content as expected. Easy to read, and shows a very positive view on life and makes the individual sole responsible for your owm life.  but not realy convinsing.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Is always and will always be my best old school of all times.i love this move and the sound tracks.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I am a fan of John LeCarre'.  He writes very well about real people, flawed people who happen to be spies of one sort or another.<br />In this case he examines the bureaucracy of the spy game from those unwittingly drawn in to those who always maintain plausible deniability, from those who operate in the shadows to those at the tip of the spear.<br />You don't put this book down feeling good or bad but you do feel you've been on an interesting journey through a part of life you'll likely never see first hand.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|True love are hard to defined, this move said it all. When you are in love trust me you are in love. It says it all , it will always be in my library forever .

B00C27LB20|4.0|Really enjoying this album! Sounds like it comes straight out of the 60s :) Pretty much every song is worth listening to over and over!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I seen the movie before reading the book and loved it. But as always, the book is much better. So much left out in the movie. They could have done so much more with it. I'm a little disappointed but movies never beat books.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Billy Connolly, Tom Courtenay, and  Pauline Collins turn in tour de force performances in Quartet. Quartet is a Masterpiece Theater type comedy with music. It takes place in a retirement home for musicians. Dustin Hoffman makes a fine debut as director and his commentary  track  is insightful.Ronald Harwood masterfully opened up his play to fit the silver screen.This is an original 2012 film ,not to be confused with either the Merchant Ivory  (1981) or the Maugham  (1948) films. Recommended!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The movies are great and now that they are on blu ray that makes them even better. I am enjoying them. Thanks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  It was hard enough to get you thinking but not so hard that it got excessively frustrating.  I wish there were more levels.  On the negative side, as others have stated, it doesn't save what you've already done on a level - if you close it out, you will have tos tart over at whatever level you were on (it remembers what level you were on, just not where you were in that level).
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This book is a very good dictionary for experienced and beginning readers/writers. The definitions are clear and very descriptive. I recommend this for all ages above seven years of age at least.
B00BEIYM42|4.0|What a joy it is to see consummate actors of the calibre of Vanessa Redgrave and Terence Stamp on the big screen. And while they may not be the youthful handsome and beautiful actors we remember from \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\" and \\"Camelot,\\" they remind us that, yes, there is still a beauty in old age. (Watching this film, I was reminded that the great photographer Imogene Cunningham published near the end of her life-- I believe she was at least 90-- beautiful photographs of old people.)<br /><br />Stamp as Arthur and Redgrave as his wife Marion play two characters in the twilight of their lives and are in a word, brilliant. But Gemma Arterton as Elizabeth, the music teacher, and Christopher Eccleston as Arthur and Marion's son James give outstanding performances as well. (The tension between Arthur and his son James is palpable. And the friendship that develops between the old Arthur and the young Elizabeth is one of the pluses of the film.) The plot is simple and could have been washed out to the British sea by a lesser director (Paul Andrew Williams directs) and less than stellar acting as the actors carry the film. (Elizabeth gets a group of seniors ready to perform heavy metal music for a contest.)<br /><br />I went to see this movie with some trepidation since the rumors I had heard were that it was a tearjerker and I had heard the words \\"too sentimental\\" bandied about. I worried in vain. Of course there are sad moments in this movie-- to experience Terence Stamp singing Billy Joel's \\"Llullabye (Goodnight, my Angel)\\" will make you tear up and is worth the price of admission to the movie-- but there are scenes that will make your smile as well. According to the MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY, the definition of \\"sentimental\\" is (a)\\"marked or governed by feeling\\" and (b) \\"resulting from feeling rather than reason.\\" Isn't this why we weep at funerals and feel overwhelming sadness when sons and daughters go off to fight in foreign lands? It is all about being human. Or as the late Celestine Sibley, a columnist for the ATLANTA CONSTITUTION once said, sometimes life will make you cry.Or as the late Celestine Sibley, a columnist for the ATLANTA CONSTITUTION once said, sometimes life will make you cry.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a wonderful conclusion to these stories. I was hooked ans I have absolutely no complaints for this book whatsoever.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I didn't expect this story's turns. I was intrigued and shocked at the experiences of the little boy in the orphanage (who calls a child by a number?) but heartened by the development of the relationships in the story. Fabulous delivery of the local accent, too.....not so easy to accomplish, I imagine. I ordered McKenna' s memoir next.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I'm obsessed. I find myself continually going back and trying to get 3 stars on all the levels. Graphics are nice and clear. Best time waster of the bunch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|keeps your attention, exciting and entertaining, would tell anyone to see this series. cant wait to see season four. when will I get to see it?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Extremely cute game with much more variety then similar games. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoyed the movies. Seems to run fine on my kindle fire 7.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game! Fun way to pass the time. I got my family addicted to it too. Fun for all ages!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A very relaxing game.  Good coordination needed to play the game -  both hands and your eyes. Try it you will like it.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|This book just wowed me and kept me wanting to read more and more. Great book!!! Get it right now
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|We saw this movie at the theater three times so we had to have it on video. I loaned it to everyone that I knew would like it.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Great book and I think everybody should read. Pretty short but to the point and sales cure all. Mark is right on point and has worked hard to get where he is which is awesome. It isn't easy but you can always fall back on sales to keep you moving. Quick read but no BS.
0062127241|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my son who has loved the Who for 30 years. He really liked it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie and it sets up for the next one. It has action like always but it is funny as well. This movie is better than the second with DC but not as good as Casino Royale.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I pretty much like anything Joss Whedon does and this movie is no exception.  Good action and special effects. Of course, the superheros are cool!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie, was sad and hopeful. I get upset watch underdogs get beaten down but happy when they come out on top.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I came late to this party.  It's a shame, too.  I wish I had seen it on a big screen.  This is a terrific film.  But it isn't for everyone.  You will need to be well rested, (it's nearly 3 hours long) and you will need to bring a few things with you.  One is your brain.  Yes, Virginia, you will have to think to comprehend this movie.  You will need to pay attention, listen carefully and think.<br />As one reviewer suggested, bring a Buddhist with you to explain some of the metaphysical aspects of the film.  You don't have to be a Buddhist to get it, but you should be familiar with the ideas reincarnation and karma.  That said, the film is not austere in any sense of the word.  It is fast-paced, and by turns, moving, thrilling and mesmerizing.<br />Watching for the principal actors in each time-frame is entertaining in a \\"Where's Waldo?\\" kind of way.  The effects are sumptuous, the story is meaty, and the transitions are deft. \\"What's not to like?\\" you may ask.  It's simple.  If you want a movie laid out in one or two straight plot-lines, cookie-cutter characters, some jiggling boobs, and a few sight-gags and pratfalls thrown in for good measure, you had better go dig out an old \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" VHS tape and crack open a Bud.  You will be out of your depth with \\"Cloud Atlas.\\"
B003Y5H54W|4.0|I enjoy being a little scared and intrigued and this movie kept you guessing all the way through to the end.
B0009VPFSW|5.0|I use this card to hold all my designs. Very user friendly and will buy more since I have hundreds of designs.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|My girls love this movie and it is worth getting for your collection.  My girls love stitch and it is kid friendly.

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|saw and ad on tv for this cd. need to have it as i have a lot of rod stewart. very happy with the purchase.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|That was a DVD movie that you have never seen since about in a movie theater in November 11, 2011
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Another glourious movie from Tarantino.  We had to see it again, after recently watching Django Unchained.  We are still debating which one we like the best.  They are good enough to keep watching over and over until we figure it out!
B0018BB20W|5.0|Ah, Moody Blues. I used to have a record of these (or maybe that was one of the friend's records) and I loved that.  I'm so glad that Amazon had this--takes me back to better times.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|All I can say is that at the end of this series, I wanted a dragon! This is an awesome show and worth the purchase.
B00002469S|5.0|Great songs from the past and easy listening music--one that I wish I had much earlier. I usually wait to get the &#34;Best of ______&#34; CDs and this what I remember as my favorites.
159420411X|5.0|A great read. It was like having a conversation with a wise tribal elder. It is hard to believe that Nate Silver is so young. His writing conveys the patient wisdom of a person who has spent a lifetime studying uncertainty.<br /><br />The book contains many interesting anecdotes and lots of examples of what works and what does not. There is a lot of inspirational stuff for people who work or play with uncertain outcomes.<br /><br />I can not help but compare it to a certain popular science book about randomness and poultry of a certain colour where the author is on long-winded self-indulgent psychotic rave and acheives nothing. &#34;The Signal and the Noise&#34; is not like that. Nate Silver knows his stuff and has the very public achievements to prove it.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|Very cool to take a trip back into the 60's for &#34;a night&#34; with Frank Sinatra at The Sands. The band is tight, Sinatra's singing is great and his monologue is funny and right-on. It must've been a fine night to be in the audience for this show.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|I thought that this will be a flimpsy one but it turned out to be durable, very attractive design for the price.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|Awesome book! Five star for a reason, it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Awesome!
B008602KQI|5.0|The acting and production were outstanding. It was a very seamless product. I would recommend parents and young teens watch together.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an awesome game as it wasn't too complicated but neither was it too easy either.  Definitely worth the two bucks in my opinion!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game looked like it would be a lot of fun.  The first floor was.  But the second floor either froze on me or I wasn't giving the correct answer.  After several tries, I looked for some help, but there was none.  Now I have a game that I really wanted to play, but can't.  There should be some help along the way.
0811879542|5.0|I purchased this book for my friend's 1-year old son.  He loves it!  I can see this book growing with a child.  It is full of &#34;instructions&#34; of things to do.  For example, the first page says &#34;Press the yellow dot&#34; and has only one dot.  The second page has two dots and says &#34;Press the left dot.&#34;  Right now my friend's boy is just listening and observing while she does the actions or she helps him do them.  As he gets older, he will be able to follow the directions and as he gets even older, he will be able to ready it and instruct others how to follow the directions.  It also works on color recognition, directional identification, and other important skills.  This is not a board book, but the paper pages are very thick.  Great book!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Very Simple to install, perfect for gaming with super overclocking capabilities<br /><br />Stock heat sink snapped into the MB with ease, so far so good!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The visuals were cool... Special effects were terrible... Had the quality of an ABC movie.  It was chock full of bad acting (James Franco, what happened to you?!), awkward timing, a poor soundtrack, and stupid jokes that weren't stupid enough to be funny.  Darn.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wonderful fun!!!! Mind challenging! Exciting way to make you really use your brain!<br />Fun to try and figure out all the clues and how to use them to make it to the next level!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My husband and I both have it on our phones, we are currently doing one of the plans.  We love it and the reminder keeps us in check.  We look forward to it each day. Keeps us close to God.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Julian Fellowes did a fantastic job, as always, with the script and development of the characters. Definitely worth the wait!!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Doesn't' anyone validate the software before releasing it anymore.<br />Major screw up.<br />I sure hope this gets resolved soon!  I've wasted too many hours out of my life to get stopped at only level 38.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Quite a few twists and turns but pretty unbelievable, I managed to finish it but more from stubborness than being enthralled..
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This timer app works great. I use it just about everyday. I wasn't sure if I would ever really use it, but it's easy to use and consistently works well.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|In a time when so many bands are TRYING to cop this sound/vibe, leave it to those who OWN this sound to return, and not a moment too soon to reclaim their crown. As someone who saw DP so MANY times in their glory days, and recently as well, these cats are a true TREASURE, so IF you get the chance to see them, PLEASE do so, bands of this caliber are few and far between, and regardless of what younger fans think, these bands ARE not going to be replaced by the current DRECK coming out, this is the result of DECADES of chops being brought to bear, and truly world class production by BOB EZRIN, listen to the new SABBATH CD to hear what a DIFFERENCE a great production job makes, whereby an outside hand guides a great band to dig down DEEP(pun intended!) and challenge themselves to meet their legacy head on, and surpass it, as DP has done here, this is a record that could, and DOES stand with the best of their career, as the Sabbath boys have done as well, and to have BOTH bands of titans come back with records of this caliber in the SAME year is truly fantastic, so in a time when so many heap undeserved praise on lameness, it IS indeed a pleasure to  salute the KINGS, DEEP PURPLE. Now, as EDDIE TRUNK so often points out, WHEN are DP going to the R and R Hall of Fame(SHAME!!)? I'm 60 this year, saw ALL the greats in their ultimate prime, and folks, I'm talkin' JIMI, DOORS, CREAM,JANIS, ZEP, WHO, simply ANYBODY you could POSSIBLY name, and NOTHING beats DEEP PURPLE at LONG BEACH ARENA in 1971, and I DO mean nothing, and they were just as good in a different way just two years ago in Vegas, so sit back, adjust your attitude, and slip this platter on, it's life affirming, thanks guys, PLEASE just keep on SPACE TRUCKIN' for all of us just as long as is possible, all fans of true great music love you and need you, and we thank you for so much joy for so many years!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love it. its really fun and cool to play. i downloaded it because i love the movie and its really like it. i recommend it.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this for my son. His pre-K teacher and Kindergarten teacher have signed it so far. I plan to get every teacher to write him a note and when he graduates high school I will give it to him. I love this book!
B00AVFO41K|5.0|With all the bad reviews, I almost didn't get CSG-Crazy Ball, but figured if everyone thought it was a no-win situation \\"game\\", it must be a challenge and I love a good challenge.  There is too much \\"let everyone win no matter how bad they are\\" attitude.  There is no time limit, except for removing the balls faster than the software can place more balls.  You have time to choose a spot anywhere on the board where the ball can move left, right, up, or down before more balls are placed.  Take the challenge.  Three levels, start with easy.  Come on, people, it is a FAOTD, give it a chance.  Give your brain a good workout along with your reflexes!!
1400052181|4.0|I really enjoyed the history behind the book. How surprising to find out such a thing about your mother/wife. However as a Southern Woman myself I did not enjoy the fact that it appears most of the family just want money. If someone came to me and told me &#34;Can I have a sample of your cells? It may change the world and cure diseases.&#34; I would not hesitate. (Yes I understand that the family claims they didn't ask. However she did receive free medical care and sign a waiver.) It wouldn't cost me a thing and I would not ask for anything in return. If I had a chance to save other lives then it's all worth it. I believe she would have felt the same way. I do not think at all she would be okay with trying to sue everyone involved. I don't know many eat least southern women who wouldn't feel the same. Think of it this way. She has saved countless lives and the science world will never be the same. Perhaps they couldn't save her which is truly sad. As a mother myself it's heartbreaking to imagine but what they learn from her cells they may cure it all one day. No other children losing their mother's or mother's losing their children. I'm glad I read it but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone else. Not because of the author but because of the constant &#34;entitlement&#34; her family feels they deserve. It makes it tough.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game, I just wish we had more chances/lives and it would be nice if the timer was shorter.
1594746036|5.0|I love all the interesting pictures and was really impressed to find out he based his story around them because they were so neat. I read it quickly and my only disappointment was when I found out the second book won't be out until next year. I can't wait! It was nice to have a book with such a strange story. I usually can figure out the whole book within the first few chapters. Not this one, it kept me wondering!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved remembering a simpler time with the great tasting root beer, without all the cell phones, when kids were allowed to play in the streets and neighborhoods without constant adult supervision, and the history of the country at that time.  Definitely kept my interest with all the twists and turns!  Thought it would take 2-3 months to get through 850 pages, but finished within 1 month.  Didn't want to put down and didn't want it to end!
1781162646|2.0|I am an avid Stephen King fan and I pre-ordered this book. Bit disgruntled to see that it has already dropped in price but that's the risk you take and I was really excited to be receiving this as soon as it was available. I know that Mr King deviated a little from his usual genre with this being a crime story. I still expected it to be as interesting and compelling as most of his other books-I was disappointed. Not only did it fail to raise the goosebumps and eerie fascination of his other work but I felt it also failed to succeed as a crime/mystery story as well.<br />There was a limited amount of characters so it was very easy to guess who the murderer was and even the investigation of the murder was laid out as a \\"fait accompli\\" rather than allowing the reader to investigate and gradually learn the facts of the case at the same time as one of the characters (which would have been more stimulating and intriguing). I also never really gelled with Devin, the main character. He was supposed to be suffering from a broken heart but, as a reader, I felt like, instead of being allowed to sense this and relive the emotions with Devin, this fact was instead battered over my head and constantly referred to. Saying he had a broken heart felt the same as saying he had blue eyes for all the empathy it aroused in me.<br />Despite this not being a horror novel, the theme and fairground aspect of the novel did give King a marvellous opportunity to introduce an element of the macabre into the book. However, the ghost was as lacklustre as the rest of it.<br />I did like the character of the little boy, Mike and this aspect of the book was quite poignant. I also quite liked the description of fairground life/work and some of the language. I would have given this book 3 stars normally but I expect a higher standard from Stephen King so I only gave it 2. He should definitely stick to writing horror/psychological thrillers. I think he never even got into second gear with this and I expect much better from Doctor Sleep when it is available (I won't be pre-ordering again though!)
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I love the mysterious questions that come up when a new problem is close. I would like to read the rest of the series.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is a bad-ass album.  I find every track to be near perfection, sonically and lyrically.  I love the contrast between a song like \\"Smooth Sailing\\", a \\"stoner-metal-blues-funk\\" song, and the title track, which reaches Floyd/Sabbath-like emotional depths.  A must-have for fans of... well, good music.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Graphics are excellent, the beginning with the minion of the week award is a riot. All in all just like the movie.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I like Enya, so this was a nice addition to my song collection. I like this type of music for easy listening while I'm at work.
B0007GAEGC|3.0|The songs that I was looking for weren't there.  I did like most of the songs.  I would buy another album of the group.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King was one of my favorite artists back when I was in high school. She actually has a lot of song lyrics credited to her.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This guide to building your book for Kindle was excellent technical help for getting the Word documents of my books into shape so that they could be converted into e-book format and published for the Kindle. It was indispensable. It's not too long, rather it's sort of a help file in e-book format.
B00000K2W1|5.0|This is yet another one of the artists who made my high school years full of music fun to listen to. Great collection of her songs in this album.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The Twitter for Kindle app is very functional and enjoyable to use. I recommend it if you use Twitter and have a Kindle Fire.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|one of the best mystery book i`ve ever read. read this or the murderer might get you. better hurry up.
0307341550|4.0|I picked this up after reading Gone Girl and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />It was fairly creepy throughout, tense in places, and at times the idea of the characters lives was quite uncomfortable.  The main character is highly flawed, and that added to her role in the book.<br /><br />I had a good idea of what I thought had happened, but what I enjoyed was the very realistic coming together of these ideas as the book drew to a close.  There were some nice elements that left me feelilng satisfied by the conclusions.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Works very well once installed. Be patient after you click install it will appear to fail but will eventually load. The first time launching takes time as well. When it is running it has no lag and all effects work. Ai is quick also. Not sure why wizards doesnt support the note 2 on the play store.
030758836X|5.0|This book changed my opinion of 1st person POV. Part one took me in one direction, and then immediately in part two the rug was whipped out from under my feet. I am now reading her other novel, sharp objects.<br /><br />There is a reason this has lingered on the best sellers lists for so long. Read it.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|This game is very simple to play, and also incredibly dull.  I don't feel like there is any incentive to keep playing. There are no levels or anything to change up the game in any way, or any type of competition. Just more balls. The game is just very, very boring.
1594488886|5.0|This story was amazing! It completely paralleled  the work the author did in The Kite Runner! I'm excited to read his next book! Plus, the book arrived in really great shape and in a timely manner!

B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Excellent movie, well-done on all counts, possibly difficult to watch.  Moves slowly in places and doesn't have a prominent \\"plot\\".  The ending leaves you wanting more, which is painful, but really that's what a good ending should do.<br /><br />Quell (the true believer) is a loose cannon, unpredictable and possibly detrimental to \\"The Cause\\" (an obvious stand-in for Scientology).  So why does Dodd (The Master) keep him around?  It would seem that, although Dodd is a charlatan, part of him truly wants to believe in what he's doing.  That part of him needs the love and reassurance only a true believer can provide.  Without that, he would have to face himself as a cynical defrauder of people.  Within the charlatan you may find the heart of a true believer.<br /><br />The more difficult part to accept -- at least for me -- is how badly Quell needs Dodd.  I've spent some time reading about Scientology, and have every impression it's a slick con designed to separate damaged people from their money.  However, look at Quell.  Dude is a total mess.  Nobody cares for him.  Can't hold down a job.  Drinks paint thinner, for chrissakes.  Even if The Cause is a dangerous cult, you can't help but think it may actually be good for him.  It gives his life structure, and at least for a time, he's surrounded by people who care about him.  However, he ultimately spurns The Cause; although he desperately needs a support structure, he just can't convince himself to buy Dodd's fictions.  Within the true believer, you may find the mind of a cynic.<br /><br />You would hope someone like Quell could find solace in something less evil, like AA or some organized religion.  And who knows, maybe he will. But it's just as likely he'll wind up like any number of drunken, half-crazed homeless men you see on the street.  The ending is a downer because it really could go either way for him.  In real life, lost souls don't always find wholesome, caring people; sometimes, the crazy-ass cults get to them first.

B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye West is the GREATEST OF ALL TIME. This album redefines the parameters of Hip Hop and breaks all of the \\"radio\\" rules. This album is not for the casual listener; it is not for those looking for that hit single to blare in the club. This is MUSIC. Music is an expression of self. Ye made this album exactly how he wanted.<br /><br />For any Kanye Stans out there, you can find subtle similarities to Late Registration with the track \\"Bound 2\\". You can see 808's in the track \\"Blood on the Leaves\\".<br />Hip Hop is an evolution of all genres of music, and that's exactly what this is. \\"Black Skinhead\\" being a more rock-type of song. Reggae influences on \\"I'm in it\\".<br />You either love this album, or you absolutely hate it, there is no in between.
B000MV8ABS|1.0|Everything about this movie had me and my friends written all over it when it was released. There wasn't a horror flick we wouldn't give at least the time of day. We went to watch almost every one of them, and this one came out our first, party saturated year out of high school, and part of an outdoor double feature at that! We were primed, pumped and ready for a great flick. We left within a half an hour. They talk about how groundsetting this flick was. To us, another way to put this was totally preposterous. We laughed, and \\"Oh brothered\\" our way as far as we could into this flick, until we just couldn't stand the absurdity any longer. Some say this movie broke the rules. That's not necessarily a good thing. We found the entire premise of this movie ridiculous in the extent it went to try to scare us. If I were thrust in the middle of this movie I wouldn't have been any less frightened. If you wanna buy into the product descriptin or Amazon review, go for it. I've bought into those sales pitches for movies I also thought were good, only to regret it later. Even when it came out on video and we gave this movie a second chance, which we rarely ever did with movies that didn't past our muster initially, we still couldn't get past a mere peak before laughter overtook us until we put something in more scary, like a Porky Pig cartoon. This movie ranks not only as one of my all time worst horror movies ever seen, but time in my life I'll never get back after wasting it. This movie stinks. The fact if had sequels proves the P.T. Barnum quote of, \\"there's a sucker born every minute.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|What's not to like about this move. I purchased it because every time I would come across this on cable I would end up watching it and sitting through the commercials. This has happened more than once because, really, who can resist this movie lol. Now when I'm in the mood for a little Grease Lighting I can pull out the DVD.
B000002KDO|5.0|Yes, their first, self-titled album introduced the world to Sabbath's dark themes. And yes, \\"Paranoid\\" gave them even more depth by diplaying more of a political voice. But \\"Master of Reality\\" was somewhat of a synopsis of them both. Lyrics will never again be as vivid, nor animated. Doom, destruction, isolation, pollution... an album that screams about the common fears in the early 70s. This album was the basis for heavy metal's origins. Outrage, rebellion, anger and to some extent, fear. And like any great horror movie, Sabbath wraps those themes in music that is telltale of the albums contents. Every band member shows great strength throughout the album. Geezer Butler is a clinic with trademark basslines in every song, particulary worth noting during Iommi's solo in \\"Sweet Leaf\\". Iommi demonstrates what a classic metal guitar riff should be from start to finish. And Ozzy has never sounded more sinister. Metal was meant to be about the themes found in \\"Master of Reality\\". It's a shame that so many Sabbath influenced bands in the 80s didn't have such a background to grow into. They could only sit at a drawing board to come up with the very themes that lay before Sabbath's eye, ripe for the taking. Only Iron Maiden would come close, and only for a short, short spell. But if one wants to know how metal's evolved and wants to learn the most successful recipe in the genre's history, then \\"Master of Reality\\" is a must. Laced with so many crunching, powerful guitar riffs, ala \\"After Forever\\" (my favorite Sabbath tune), \\"Into the Void\\", and \\"Children of the Grave\\" and head turning lyrics (especially for their time) like \\"would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope, do you think he's a fool?\\" from \\"After Forever\\" and Sweet Leaf's \\"you introduced me to my mind, and left me wanting you and your kind\\" in reference to one man's experience with marijuana. One has to believe that Nixon had the feds following these fellas around when touring the USA. If he considered Mc Govern a threat to the country, what do you think the privacy invading Nixon felt about the likes of theses Brits? \\"Master of Reality\\" is what rock and roll was meant to be. Raw, controversial, crude but with direction, and alarming to the adults at the time. I can still see the faces on many a parent when hearing the opening of \\"Sweet Leaf\\". A little knowledge about the early 70s might help one understand the album a little better, though it's not necessary to appreciate the richness of the this band's musical onslaught. But it took such an era to launch a band with the voice and anger of Black Sabbath. Future metal bands will show the Sabbath ifluence, with better production providing more polished sounds. But a lack of similar environment will be missing, depriving them of the most necessary ingredient to harbor such authentic pain.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Like many of the Ghibli films, this is a true gift of creativity.  Easy enough for children 3+ to watch and being a Westerner very intriguing how the East side of the world is so vastly different.  With a strong voice cast and beautifully drawn backdrops I recommend this to anyone who is willing to embark on a voyage of magic and love.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I am addicted to the game. Glad I have all summer to play. Reminds me of when I was a kid.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|So I needed another charging cable for my legend.  I ordered one and this as well.  It's great!  Only time I will ever need to charge the Bluetooth midday is in case of airport travel and lots of calls and this is 100% perfect for that.  Also enables me to charge with a familiar micro USB cable and have something I probably won't lose.  It says it will charge the Bluetooth twice; but I have been able to squeeze about 3 out of it.
0525478817|5.0|I highly recommend this book! With it's snappy dialogue and heart-wrenching characters, this is one book that everyone should read!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was riveted to this book and couldn't put it down and was really looking forward to how it was going to be wrapped up.  The book was excellent and very well written, but........the ending?? not so much.  I loved the book anyway.  Give it a read, you won't be sorry.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|One of the more complicated but yet satisfying games I've experienced in a long time. Keep up the good work. Thanx!!
B003MXEUYO|5.0|Believe it or not, I think this is the best of all the Die Hard's. Bruce Willis ages well and keeps the story moving well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this game woulda gave 5 stars but it likes to freeze up. I love hidden object games keeps you on your toes
B006VFLIYK|3.0|This is the first Baldacci novel that I've read. Historical fiction is my usual genre, so I may not be the best to evaluate the writing and plot. However, while it may not have been exquisite writing,  I must say that it definitely kept my interest from beginning to end. It's a great summer read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and entertaining game where you search for clues and solve puzzles.  this game requires good memory,  logic,  and patience
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This movie was very Van Helsing-esque but still very entertaining.  I like the headlining actors a lot so that helped me overlook the lacking storyline.  The ending was so quickly wrapped up that the it felt incomplete and rushed.  Overall, pretty entertaining and action-packed.
1577314808|4.0|Doubtful my hard core Christian friends would like this as it relies a lot on Eastern philosophy and tradition. On the other hand, the suggestions and insights are right on.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I hadn't read anything about this movie before seeing it.  Didn't know it was about witches/warlocks.  I thought the storyline was decent, as with the acting.  The boy and girl are unknown actors to me - their chemistry was just ok.  The relationship between them was a little unbelievable.  Interesting scenes/settings, interesting storyline.  Overall, pretty entertaining.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|I was skeptical after the first episode but episode two and beyond is brilliant. I watched the whole season in a day.
B000EXZI14|5.0|It's funny how well received the BeeGees music was as part of &#34;Saturday Night Fever&#34;and ,yet how badly Disco dancing was slammed. I like all kinds of music and watching good dancers.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This review contains no spoilers, but if you really know Sookie as a character, this is the perfect conclusion for who she really is.  Masterful end to a fantastic series.  I will miss Sookie!
B00847KFDS|4.0|I liked him then in my 50's (?) and I like him now @ 74. glad he continues to make music.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app has amazed young and old alike.  My son and Grand kids have tried the app and are dazzled by how quickly it answers their requests. This is one of my favorite apps.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was SO good! I found myself cheering for Mariam and Laila; feeling their grief, their pain, and their joy. I would definitely recommend this book, especially to those who enjoyed Kite Runner.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Even though this story starts at the accident, the author writes in such a way that you fall in love with her life, her family, the relationship she has with her parents and brother, her best friend. You even fall in love when she falls in love with her boyfriend. If you could reminisce about your life. If you could see the loss your future would hold. Would you stay?
B004LX0D36|5.0|In the 18th century, you would think when rules and standards & morals were available & applied to help a lady find her proper place in society.  But life is not perfect for Elinor & Marianne, two sisters struggling to find their way to happiness.  Their story deals with the exception in life.  The main characters, Elinor & Marianne, are faced with an economic change in their lifestyle and each deals with the situation differently.  One with common sense, the other with romance.  Neither one seems to be able to solve their problems, until they learn to grow, learn, and change.  One sister almost dies from a broken heart: and the other doesn't believe she cannot survive life's disappointments.. A very entertaining book and more interesting than the movie.  A must read for those trying to figure out the human condition.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|Dealing with the aftermath of the accident and Mia's decision, Adam's life is out of control.<br />I like that the book is in Adam's perspective and you can see the pain and frustration of losing someone you love is doing to him. You also get to see the weight being lifted off his shoulders as a new chapter in his life begins.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy it as much as the first, but I'm happy that the story didn't end with Mia in If I Stay. I'm glad I got to see the journey after.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun! I had it on my phone know its on my kindle yea!!!! everyone needs to buy thus
B005U9QJY2|5.0|I remember watching this on cable when I was around 9 or 10, home from school with the flu.  It was a cable special for the week coincidentally.  The film is very imaginative and good.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Quentin rarely disappoints nor does Jamie Foxx.  The message is clear with hoops and challenges clearly illustrated.  Enjoyable movie for the open minded.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Had this on my PC...glad to see they came out with an App for it...play it on my Kindle Fire. Love the game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game in the world!!!!! I love this game it's the best! I love this game you should to!!:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is reallly fun u can connect wit ur freinds to.it amazing. And awesome.plus its free you get coins
B003VANOFY|5.0|Excellent product. There was no problem of compatibility, no strange noises and, really, the sound is high quality.<br /><br />A little low expectation of battery life, but man ... it really is because I keep using them.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can be a little picky when it comes to books, but I did think this was an easy to get addicted to series.  ;-)
B004SCN2F6|4.0|The only thing I could ask is a little more variety in combat text, otherwise a fantastic game. Worth the money for the elite edition.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera has always been one of my favorite movies. Even as a young girl, I found the original movie so very romantic. I love the 2004 remake, the costumes were just beautiful & the music ,of course, was magnificent.  This is a must see.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My great-grand-daughter and I really enjoyed this movie. It is just plain fun. We will  definitely watch it again next time she is here.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|great book, I love this series, it keeps you on your toes and can hardly wait for the next one
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is fun and challenging!!I first started playing alone but before I got thru the second level--not only were my children wanting to solve levels but so were the grandkids!!!!This app has become the center of attention around here!!!most entertaining!!!
B00AVFO41K|4.0|[UPDATE 2013/07/21: Due to the extraordinary responsiveness of the developer, and his very hard work in improving this app, I've reevaluated the game and changed my review to cover the new version.]<br /><br />Star Trek fans will understand what Kobayashi Maru means.  For those of you unfamiliar with the term, it is an exercise in futility; the \\"No Win\\" scenario.  In the Star Trek universe, it is a test that academy seniors endure to test how they would handle a \\"no win\\" situation.<br /><br />In this game, you try to keep up with the computer to prolong your game and increase your score.  You do this by getting five (or more) of the same color pieces in a line - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  You are aided by special pieces with bombs and arrows, which will destroy pieces in neighboring squares or along the line in which it points, respectively.  There are also multicolored pieces, also sometimes with a special inside, which can be added to a line to replace the needed color.<br /><br />The game now is easier to play since the FAOTD release, at least on the \\"easy\\" level.  I played for over a half-hour on easy, and was slowly losing; however, it felt that I *might* have a chance which greatly added to the pleasure of playing the game.  Now it feels fun instead of frustrating; kudos to the developer for that!  Be forewarned that occasionally the game doesn't understand that you want to use the piece to eliminate a line if it is placed at the end against another multicolored piece (in other words, three colors and two multicolors don't necessarily trigger the line's destruction).  Also, there is still a movement bug where a piece would occasionally not move despite it being a legal move, but hopefully that's on the list of things to do for the developer.<br /><br />The scoring is simple.  Too simple, as in my opinion you should get a higher score for getting more than 5 pieces in a row.  But, you simply get 10 points per piece, whether it is matched or destroyed.  The graphics and sound are decent, and there is no background music.  This game could use some sort of background music; I nominate Darth Vader's March to go with the overall theme of impending failure.<br /><br />The developer added a leaderboard, and it appears something of his own creation, or at least an unknown leaderboard that doesn't (yet) seem as evil as previous well-known leaderboards.<br /><br />One last thing: the developer's native language is NOT English, so there are spelling and grammatical errors.  Please don't disparage the developer for that, as he really is trying.  He's responsive and eager to please.<br /><br />Here is a promising developer with a decent game that's now fun.  I am comfortable giving four stars to the game for the enjoyment and for the deserving efforts of the developer.oyed.  The graphics and sound are decent, and there is no background music.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Beautiful story.  I'd love to give a more substantial review, but I would just be pretending to have the words that could do this book any justice.  I'll just say I'm in love.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love ﻿the story as it keeps getting better. Hate that ﻿the story is not over yet. But it still keeps you guessing.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I am totally hooked on this series, I love Carol, played by Melissa McBride, she is a really great actress, when she was in the church praying for God to watch over her little girl, it was so real it made me cry.  I also love Darrell, and I hope that Carol and Darrell will get together, I think it is working toward that.  I can't wait for season four.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|My kids and I loved this movie. It was really worth watching. We are hoping there will be a number 2!
0425263924|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book-however, did not like to have to wait 3 months after reading the 2nd book to read this one.  I am hoping Sylvia Day will write another one since things were left &#34;hanging&#34; at the end of book 3.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a great game. hoping for more rooms soon. great job! the rooms are a lot of fun to go thrum as well. no problems on my kindle fire.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've always used this as my email  I really haven't had any problems with using this program will continue to use it
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Issacson's research left no stone unturned. In reading this you not only see how Steve saw himself but also how those closest saw him. I could hardly put the book down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great program to use for social networking love to  keep in touch with friends and family  access to pictures things that m mean the most to me
B000AQJPQE|5.0|What an awesome light for a kids room, looks and works great! My son loves, it never seen one like it in any lighting stores i have been to.
B002EULANU|5.0|If your a max lover.. u should already know.. he is awesome.. nothing but excellence from my booskie.. I'm in love.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I almost wanted to walk to the PCT after reading it but then I instantly realized how crazy that was :) . It was a great story about finding oneself and moving forward.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is about the best free app out there. Jetpack Joyride is completely legit in every way, and is highly fun, addicting, and even quite challenging at times. This game never gets old. I also love how customizable it is. Between the gadgets, outfits and jetpacks, there are infinite possibilites.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I LOVED this book! It was an instant page turner and several months after reading it, I am still thinking about the story.  I loved the way the story was told from past to the present.  I wished I would have kept the flower dictionary that was at the end for future reference.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game let's you play online with other people but also a mission giver to not get bored I love the gameplay and the fact that it's like call of duty on the road
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was at times very challenging.  I loved it,some games are just to simple this was just right. I Look forward to more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really fun and great game and it have a lot of good pictures and graphics and its really fun when u have to beat victor and I think it's just a really great game for anyone who want to get it or like despicable me game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a little slow getting started and stays a bit like that unless you want to pay to speed things up. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun with really great looking graphics. I wish you had more control over the direction your horse goes on course, too. But besides those little deets it's awesome :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you escape is a really fun game. The last couple of levels are kind of challenging, but there are only 10 levels.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A must see especially for anyone who has read the book! I had to read it clear back in 9th grade which was in the 60's. it was probably one of the first classic novels that I finished.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love it keeps the mind active  got my mom playing as well she tries to beat my scores thanks  Love love it  so looking forward to the higher levels
B00ANT2FHO|5.0|I bought this CD because my brother recommended it. It far exceeded my expectations. I like or love every song. Track 7 \\"You Don't Have To\\" is my absolute favorite! Definitely get this album!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a really fun game. You get to do a lot before you have to decide whether to buy the full game. The price is very reasonable for all the work that obviously went into creating the game. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was very interesting for those curious about the legal and prison system, but incredibly interesting for those who focus on a good plot.  The book was enjoyable on many levels.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My 5 year old loves this movie! It actually has helped him to think that 'monsters' are funny! Its such a cute and funny little movie, I love it as well!
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|I'd heard so many good things about this movie, yet I'd never felt quite in the mood to sit down and watch it. Then one day, as I was getting over a migraine, I turned it on. About a quarter way in, my roommates came in and joined me.<br /><br />Traditionally, my roommates aren't big fans of fight movies, but the story, more than the fights is what is emphasized here. In this heyday of big budget, high action, little-to-no-plot films, the entirety of the action of this movie only serves to focus in on the pains and trials that one family undergoes as it works towards harmony and acceptance.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Still not a conclusion..Good read but you definitely have to read the first two..<br />Cant wait for the next one
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely loved this game on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Stunning graphics and a not too difficult game, enjoyed it thoroughly.
0920236162|3.0|The story is so short and clearly meant to deliver the point that it isn't that engaging. I'm fully for making princess stories that refute the frilly, helpless, beauty-is-my-identity princess thing, but they have got to stand up to the standard fair in terms of quality of writing and engaging story, or the kids will choose the Disney versions every time. It gets three stars only because the idea was good and the illustrations are good.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Really like the storyline. It keeps you wanting to watch more. Great series would recommend it as a must watch.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Title says it all sucks like crap If you don't believe me waste your money and try it out this game sucks
B00AVFO41K|4.0|The object of this game is NOT to clear the board. Yes. Its difficult. That's the point. Sorry babies, if hard stuff isn't for you than don't play. It requires more than 4 brain cells and you must be able to logically make the best move to get rid of the balls. There's special balls which help a lot. This isn't a clear it out game, this is a how far can you take this style game. Its great.The controls are not even close to being difficult to figure out, my niece picked up my phone and started playing instantly, even not knowing the point she started to line up pieces in the corner according to color and figured it out omg her own. If a 6 year old can figure this out there is absolutely no reason a grown adult cannot. That's just absurd. This is challenging on all levels and very interesting, the random balls popping up add an element of surprise. If you like to be lazy, if you NEED to &quot;win&quot;, if you cannot figure out simple tap then tap again controls, if you do not like surprises, if you cannot handle challenges (majority of the people using amazon for free apps because they're too cheap to buy them) then do not bother with this game. Especially if you're just going to post a whiny review of how &quot;hard&quot; it is and how you can't &quot;win&quot;.<br /><br />Controls are extremely simple.<br />Love the challenge factor.<br />Great time waster.<br />Easy on the eyes and is great for my niece and nephew to play.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Downloaded this app for home use but came in really handy for planning my vacation.<br />Used it on the road to plan activities.<br />Wouldn't be without it.
1583334386|3.0|While the things in the book were generally steadfast, I didn't get much out of it. Maybe I didn't read it properly, or maybe it wasn't written as well as it could have been.
1590710487|5.0|\\"Belushi: A Biography\\" is probably the best all-around book on who John Belushi was.<br />It's an oral history, not prose-driven hyperbole on one aspect or another of Belushi's personality. They're all there--all the aspects and almost every human that ever knew him.<br />On one hand, you have the incredibly charming and irresistible sweetheart who no human being was immune to. Belushi successfully talked his way--without ID--into Canada and the White House, both of which are impossible, no matter who you are. He was also able to get a marriage license without ID. (Did I mention he never carried ID on him? After 1975, he didn't need to.)<br />On the other, you have the self-destructive, insecure.....ah, you know the rest.<br />One of the most surprising details that comes out, mentioned by more than a few people, was that Belushi was \\"the most professional\\" actor many people had ever worked with. There was no chaos or drugs or refusals unless he was very unhappy with what was going on (as in the filming of \\"Neighbors\\"). Otherwise, he was on time and ready to work and he expected everyone else to be as well.<br />Perhaps one of his problems was not really his own. Sometimes, he didn't seem best served by the people around him when it came to business. Even in the short time removed from the 1980s, stars of his level now have even more power to dictate what and who they want to work with. This could have kept him away from some very self-destructive behavior.<br />Belushi had a whole team of people pulling for him personally, in things that weren't business related. His wife, family, friends. When you know what's coming, it's very sad.<br />Judy Belushi has put together a very fine collection of memories. His life should have gone on much longer. Perhaps the best thing about the book is the hundreds of photographs, on virtually every page. It only adds to the bittersweet feeling this will leave you with.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I can just state a name (or two) and I think it should explain all: Dame Maggie Smith! Oh, and in the 3rd season we get a treat - Shirley MacLaine in a two episode arc! Must watch.
096798467X|4.0|Gives plenty of ideas. Some basic how-tos, but essentially says experiement, create, learn as you go, and do it again! Have fun along the way. Not bad things to say. Builds confidence perhaps. Will help a bit in trouble shooting. I much enjoyed the read.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Seriously, Love this movie. Beyonce takes on Ali and its the ultimate girl fight. Great plot, disk arrived super fast and was in great condition.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you want to read something close to 50 Shades of Grey, this is the series of books to do that.  I an just picture what Gideon looks like in my minds eye.  Sylvia Day has made him yummy!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This isn't a typical escape the room game. It's centralized around a contraption through each chapter. You must solve puzzles to open the contraption to discover another set of puzzles enclosed within. This definitely exercises your mind and I only had to look up a cheat only once. The puzzles are reasonable without being boring. The graphics are amazing and it never glitched. I hope they make a sequel soon!
B004AGI2L4|4.0|Another good solid Roman movie. Lot's of good fighting and battles. Better than the movie the Eagle. I wish they would make some more movies about htis topic.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, great app, easy for the kids.  So easy to use, wife thinks its a great app as well.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Super fun and a nice challenge. Love it! More please... the characters are adorable and so silly. Good stuff! I hope New levels are created soon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a really good game that is not like PC VERSION they will up date it  but it doesn't have caves or emeralds,villagers,  and lots of other stuff so if you want minecraft with all that stuff  go buy PC version if you cant by it this is a good place to start  also heres a good seed (0.4.0) by the way build your house near where you start :-)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|While Downton may not be everyone's cup of tea I find the intersection of commoners and lords at a time of such great change to be enthralling! The acting is top notch and while some of the characters seem to be bastards with no more reason than just to be bastards and the drama can get a little soap opera-y over all Downton is an amazing series.
B0015RDGD0|1.0|I didn't know that I could see it with the purchase of the dvd , so I didn't use it!
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I watched Cloud Atlas last weekend, half expecting an ambitious but overcomplicated mess. Instead I came away thoroughly impressed by a thoughtful film with a clear thematic arc and a message relayed by stories that interweave in complex -- but not overcomplicated -- ways. It's rich enough to reward multiple viewings, but I felt that I understood it after only one. It's paced more deliberately than many modern films, but never boring. Not for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. I hope it finds the success as a cult favorite that eluded it in theaters.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|Bought this for a friend that had hers stolen.  Not one of my favorites, but is an OK story that parallels the corporate VS human entities of this world.
B0026PA05M|5.0|This CD is awesome! Their music is great and this CD definitely shows that. Just listen to the clips and I'm sure that you'll love it, too.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Watch this movie; you'll not be disappointed, unless you just don't like mafia movies in general. Excellent sound tracks also.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love him, great CD of course from Michael, If you like him hey just get all of his CD'S  HE'S THE BEST !!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|good show, good quality keep bringing those guys, they make me happy. can you bring the new season of the good wife...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|First of all the beginning of the game show what the minion named Dave doing and it lets you play right away instead of waiting and the animation is amazing.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|Don't download this game. It has a virus. My kindle started running so slow after I downloaded it. Please just do not download!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun game but the multiple downloaded are annoying. Requires you to agree to licensing terms but offers no option to view terms prior to agreeing.  Shady.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love the game its great and all but really why does it need to be to be a lot of money for the ponies I wanted to get more money but really buying and wasting I want it to be less money for buying the ponies
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very well written screen version with very good acting by the main characters.  I would recommend this movie to friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun take on the Temple Run concept.  Nice to play this type of game in another setting.  Can't go wrong getting this one.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|One of the best shows EVER. Great characters, interesting, but not overlydone plots, gorgeous fashion, fun to watch. Favorite character--Louis Litt.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good entertainment. It won't change your views on life or bring you enlightenment, but it was fun to watch! It made me want to watch the Ironman series!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The are by far the most Awesome books I have ever read even the second time around!  Love E.L. James!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I thought it was a simple drawing app but in fact, it gives you different options that makes the strokes realistic. &#60;3
1781162646|5.0|Another great book by Stephen King!!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Stephen King or loves whodunnuit books.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The Avengers film is comic book fun plus Joss Whedon clever plus Robert Downey, Jr snark. This combo equals awesome.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This app ordered things on my Acct that I did not order. Charging things to my credit card that I did not confirm or order....... Sufis Sufis Sufis.
B000HKYN74|4.0|The best TV series of the Star Trek franchise.  Good theme song, mostly good plots, Vulcan eye candy, a good ol' boy engineer, interesting aliens, a dose of time travel, and lots of action.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a fun game to keep me busy while waiting for something. if you get it I'm sure you'll love it
B0095P31L6|4.0|It was a cute, albeit somewhat weird, movie -- some really clever lines and parts and, frankly, one of Johnny Depp's best and fully-realized roles.  I definitely recommend it!
0385336950|5.0|This was a gift for my son-in-law and he was quite pleased with it. He used it that very week.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book picked up exactly where the second one left off. Hard to believe the whole series spans just a few weeks. It's hot and steamy and swept me in right away. Great writing as all of Sylvia Day's books are.<br />Can't wait for the next one, as there are SO MANY loose ends that just have to be tied up! (no pun intended!)
B00A83075M|5.0|The movie and its format are great entertainment for the kids.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a movie for their 5+ y.o.
B0083SBJXS|2.0|Maybe I expected too much, but I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 & 2. Thor and Captain America were okay. This combo just didn't do it for me.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The quality of the BlueRay is great - too bad the movie is slightly disappointing - boring in parts actually.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is fun, although there aren't quite enough levels. I wonder if future levels will be free or if they will be paid.
B005LAIH2C|1.0|I eagerly anticipated this movie for months, and now that I've finally seen it, I'm left sitting here going: What? Are you kidding me? The dialogue, story, effects . . . all of it was incredibly bad. The only thing keeping this movie afloat is the stellar cast. I really hope they don't do a sequel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|wonderful show of the early 1900's and the changes around the world that impacts this family and community.  wonderful story line and characters.
B009R659L8|5.0|This tantalizing tale kept me on toe until the very end.  Absolutely loved it and immediately looked for another future release from Mrs. Clark.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Ok!! so whens the last book coming out!! Need to know the ending to this story!! Does Cross get away with murder!! Hmmmmm
B005FVNIW6|2.0|Disappointed in this as I thought there would be something good having seen the hype. Extremly boring predictable and unbelievable for me.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Loved the first series and this one did not disappoint either.<br />I love the time period for many reasons: the acting, story, costumes scenery, buildings...<br />and it is just easy enjoyment all around.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It wakes me up and helps me out with like when I need to do stuff  like working out and stuff love it its awesome u should get it
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|Awesome family fun. My kids look forward to watching this movies everytime I rent it. Well done. I loved this movie so much I bought the sound track.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Awesome series. I've never been so in love with a story and its characters! Hopefully this one is renewed for many more seasons.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Drives my wife crazy that my 6 yr. old can play this game and she can't hahaha. Awesome game LOVE it
B004WCTLNY|4.0|With some gimmicks, a pretty good love story well played by the Stars and a good cast of supporting players. The simple story is dressed up with touches reminiscent of various films of the past; these end up not carrying much weight relative to the basic Boy Loves Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl classical Hollywood pattern. The Fate vs. Freewill business can easily be ignored since is just part of the &#34;different kind of love story&#34; and matters not a bit to the basic plot. If the stars are not to your taste, then the movie will fall flat; otherwise, a good film to while away a couple of hours in the evening.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like historical fiction, the world of the peerage and the intrigues that develop out of human interactions, you'll love this series.  A good mixture of seriousness and humor, joys and pain which after all mirrors life.  It is also an insightful look at class systems in society and how people can be conditioned to accept their place in it without question.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This is a great app and works flawlessly I would recommend this app for storage of photos to prevent loss of your photo collection
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is a must have but you must have part 1 to get part 2. The all star cast was great and the action was good.
0141194073|4.0|F. Scott at his near best. This has to be my 2nd favorite book of his after The Great Gatsby. Would recommend this!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Ben was real good in this story i really enjoyed it. The action was good and the speed and timing where also good.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Great graphics! The game is short. The point is to keep playing over and over to improve your high score. If you don't like to do that then this isn't the game for you.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|It was good but a little slow at times.I found myself looking away at times while it was slow paced. There is no need for a part 2.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I like a larger screen for my games I guess.......I like my desktop to do that and will pretty much stick to it in that respect
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Better then Subway surfers,Temple run,and temple run 2.I highly recommend this game. You should get this. It's awesome. Please get this game you won't regret it.
0783116934|4.0|This good movie encompasses three themes: (1) a serial killer who victimizes mostly children, (2) a police forensic analyst driven to capture the killer at all costs, and (3) a stodgy soviet bureaucracy more concerned with ideological factors than with solving the crimes. With these three opposing forces the movie develops excellent tension, although slow at times, and medium speed at others. That's right, this is not action, it is a crime thriller/drama (if that genre exists) not concerned so much with the progress that the detective makes in fingering the killer, but rather with the dramatic tension between the detective and the ruling committee overseeing his investigation into the crimes. Jeffrey DeMunn is excellent as the meek, insecure, but brutal sex killer who prefers children, although the movie wisely does not show the brutality up close. Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, and Max Von Sydow produce stellar performances to provide complementary counterweights in the overall scheme of things.  In my opinion, this film concentrates primarily on the internal politicking of the old soviet machine to serve the needs of the party first, then everything else. Secondly, there is the efforts by Stephen Rae as the detective bent on finding the culprit. Thirdly, we have the killer and his method of finding, apprehending, and killing his victims. I did not give this film 5 stars because it seemed a bit slow to me.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|If you like boring games then this is the game for you if it does not put you to sleep first.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Just a dumb movie .. Longest car chase ever just stupid . Bruce Willis should be embarrassed but money rules \\"actors\\" lives I guess
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is one of the better weather apps I have tried. It has a great layout, easy to navigate, interactive map, informative forecast, and all the measurements and tools about current weather.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun and it is for all ages it downloaded easily and it is very much like subway surfers but I like this a lot better.
B001I10ABE|1.0|this record skips every time on all the albums even after i got a brand new needle very very sad
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions from dispicable me and dispicable me 2 and this is a great game it just freezes a little bit but besides that it's a great game:)
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Went along with the movie scene perfectly. Pharrell always makes great music and this one really was impressive. I would recommend it to anybody.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|The is really just a web client which opens the Gmail web experience. No offline support. Slightly shady promotional material makes me question the safety of entering my password through this app.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book is amazing and that is my opinion!<br />It will give you an idea of the surprise in the end!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be my favorite go to app for weather. the new update causes it to freeze constantly and the layout is not simple and useful as it once was. I miss the pollen forecast, maps take forever to load and everything is confusing. uninstalling and will be finding a new weather app!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game I love the little tiny minions and when your minion becomes big and you get extra minion coins
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|Best album,  start to finish by ANY band in years.  This album proves rock is not dead. Thanks so much QOTSA.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Terrible acting.  Non-compelling story.  Cheesy visual effects.  Previews left me feeling like this was going to be a great family movie with plenty for the adults and kids.  In the end it's nothing more than a cheesy kids movie.  I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest so I had to get the app. This is a very easy app to use. It's set up very much like the site itself. One thing though, when just scrolling through everything the posts can seem small and you might have to actually click on them to read them but, that just has something to do with screen size. I have this app on my Kindle and my smartphone. I can see fine on the Kindle but on my phone (Samsung Transform Ultra) it can be a bit small and my phone screen isn't tiny by any means.
1932735410|1.0|My dept was required to pass the PMP exam this year, so each of us purchased this book to study. After a couple months of studying this book, we went to a PMP Exam boot camp and learned that the core identity of the PMI Project process, the Process Chart, was incorrect in the book. Rita created her own chart, which is much more complicated than that in the PMBOK. Even our teacher told us not to use the book, that it was all wrong.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My 2.5 year old daughter just adores the movie Ponyo. The movie as a whole is very cute and sweet, since it was made for children around 5 years old. There's no real &#34;lesson&#34; behind this movie other than love comes in many forms but, if your children are like mine, they don't care about that, they just care that it's an awesome cartoon full of funny cuteness. Definitely a good movie to add to the collection!
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Had not seen this move before catching it on amazon. It was a great pop corn movie. I had very modest expectations and was pleasantly surprised, great special effects, moved quickly, and as a fan of marvel comics it stayed true to the Thor myth per Stan lee
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a bad game but don't like to have to wait for new levels to come available. Will wait for a short time but then may delete
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie was great! It tied in so many aspects of the marvel universe and opens the door to a ton of possible sequels. I am a huge Stan lee fan and this movie represented his genius for characters and superheroes!
B00003CX9W|1.0|It was a shame what they did with one of the greatest production from Walt Disney's Studios. I will not wast my time point out the inumerable mistakes errors and misconceptions in this new version of Fantasia. I sincerely hope that someday people is allowed to see the \\"real Fantasia\\", the way that Walt Disney made it.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|The case does all it's intended purposes well. The kickstand is a very useful feature and it's nice to hold. There are some build quality flaws though. I solved one of them which was the case not completely closing, all I did was just crease the cover flap and stayed completely closed. The other two comes in terms of build quality. The first problem is the edges around the top cover, it's starting to peel after about a month of use. This tells me it won't last as long as a basic plastic case. The other is the molding on the back that goes on top of the camera. The back cover portion doesn't &#34;fit&#34; perfectly around that molding, which causes a gap in between the molding and the &#34;leather&#34; back.<br /><br />I would expect a bit more refinement from an OEM, but it still does it's purpose well.
B00CZF87TY|5.0|Many fun tunes from the new movie!  Highly recommend!  Pharrell rocks!  Can't go wrong with this fun soundtrack and sequel!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Mr. & Mrs. Bates are a great couple to watch. Mary and Matthew are a wonderful couple too. Unrealistic consequences of the gay valet, he would have been fired and maybe given a reference. You are applying todays liberal reactions to a time long ago. It's just not realistic.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is really entertaining. I flew through these pages because it was hard to put down. It's definitely worth the read.
B00AG297GK|4.0|As with other Sacha Baron Cohen movies, I was expecting dark and silly comedy and this movie delivered it! Not the best comedy movie but if you enjoy dark humor you will be entertained till it ends.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|It's a very sad but INTENSE book. I don't know how the author could come up with something so harsh!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's very nice, but I don't like how when you run again, it loads all over again.  It's just taking more time.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. There are some things about it--rewards, etc. that are not explained and I do not yet understand what they are for, but if you like bingo-this one is fun!
B00756GRUE|2.0|The watch is ok. But the &#34;pearl&#34; on the top of the bezel is too small and has a gap on the side of it. (If you google this you'll find pictures with this problem on &#34;watchuseek&#34;.) Seiko apparently has high quality products but in my opinion, that is a very low quality flaw.  I am going to return this one and order another one.  Hopefully the next one doesn't have anything wrong with it.
145210655X|5.0|I have to admit I'm loving reading this books to my self ;) Can't wait to read them to future generations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is a lot of fun to play and i love doing the missions and getting new characters ro play with.
B00ARAO6R6|5.0|Some people did not like this film and I can see it's not for everyone but me, I eat this shit up. Matthew M is amazing in this role and all the performers really dig into the material. A perfect slice of trailer park trash ...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a very exciting game. It reminds me of  other games that are similar to this. Th  characters are funny and so adorable. It is easy yo play and spend time so you won't get bored. You should play it. It can be fun at any age
B00992CF6W|3.0|The concept of minecraft is an awesome, totally addicting game. I would give it five stars. But the reason I only gave it three is because:<br /><br />1. I took off half a star because I have a Kindle Fire 2nd gen and I cannot host a server. I can join my friends' worlds but the can't join mine. Please fix this Amazon/Mojang - whoever's fault it is.<br />2. I took off another half star because of all the glitches. Whenever  I play multiplayer with my friends we have to be really careful when we use the talking thing cause my kindle freezes up the crashes and I<br /> have to restart it. Also when we play on survival mode sometimes my kindle doesn't let me collect anything and all the people but me freeze and then suddenly they zoom around doing everything they were doing when my kindle was frozen extra fast. And it's really annoying when my kindle crashes in the middle of a game because sometimes we lose really important stuff like what we were holding. Please fix this as well.<br />3. I took off a whole star because of Amazon's slow updates. Iwaited until Monday for an update that came out on Thursday for Apple and  Android products. Now I'm angry again because a new update for 0.7.2 just came out and my friend with an Apple iPod got it but I didn't. I can still play with her unlike with the last devastatingly slow update but it is not the same. Kindle users are not receiving the service they deserve. Major issues like this a bound to drive users to Apple and Google play instead. Fix this issue now.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|I've only had this mouse for a few days ago and I'm already in love.

B0089XH38M|5.0|So far - security works great. I would recommend to all. Cant beat the free apps security download.I also have VG for my home computer too.
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|VEry touching story or middle age couple coming to terms with love and relationship. Tommy Lee delivers his role as salty husband set in his ways, while Merryl is determined to change their love life.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It wont let me wouch videos. It sucks it is the threed worst app every. You won't like it. it won't let you play videos.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Excellent book. This series is even better than the first Percy Jackson series. My daughter and I read them all and we both loved them.
B009949RKC|3.0|It is ok.  I am not so overwhelmed.  There were a few times when I grabbed my husband's arms and there was some interesting and original camerawork.  There were a few surprises and twists and the mom was very creepy. Overall entertaining and worth watching especially as a &#34;classic&#34;.
B001NXDIMK|4.0|Different and edgy. The characters all have an agenda. Sometimes you like Patty and then other times you can't stand her.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|The movie was great! I didn't have any buffering problems or anything. The video quality was great also. Very convenient! Loved it!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|My daughter uses an older tablet (Coby Kyros, running Android 2.1).  Until yesterday, she was able to read all her kindle books on this device.<br /><br />Yesterday she wanted to open the Amazon App Store to look for new applications.  The App Store would not work (apparently there had been \\"updates\\" since she used it last) so we had to re-download it from the web and reinstall it.  Two things happened: 1-several of her apps stopped working, with no updates available, and 2-the Kindle eReader now reports \\"The application Amazon Kindle (process com.amazon.kindle) has stopped unexpectedly.  Please try again.\\"  This happens every time we open it (version 3.8.x.x).<br /><br />We went out to the app store to try to update the eReader, but could not find it in the app store.  Weird, so we went to the website, and found it there.  When we tried to download it, we received a message that it is not compatible with the device (so the reason we couldn't find it in the app store is amazon was hiding it from our device).<br /><br />What amazon has done is drop support for older devices for the kindle eReader, AND made the old version of the app stop working with the App Store update.  All of my daughter's books are unavailable to her now, unless she gets a new device.  I'm sure Amazon is expecting that the new device will be a Kindle.<br /><br />Such stupidity should not go unpunished.  We will get her a new device - and it will be a Nook.  She can get the Kindle app for it to read the books she's already purchased (B&N allows it!), and buy new books from B&N.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|For a long time I've been using \\"The Weather Channel\\" on my Fire and Fire HD; then yesterday, they changed it to a totally new version.  The original version was very useable.  This new one is very hard to use and it has the trashy ads at the bottom which it never had before.  The one thing I really dislike is that they changed what was on my Kindle without asking me.
B007PKDW44|2.0|I got this because I heard Heaven Nor Hell and thought it was a cool tune.  I then listened to the CD and after 1000 \\"Whooaaaaaa's\\" at the end of every verse line I just couldn't take it.  It seems like this vocalist took the James Hetfield style a little too far.  So far that I just can listen to this anymore without being annoyed at the end of each line he sings.  Just not my thing.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I do love this app but I wish there was more variety in the objectives and challenges. After a point the objectives become very monotonous. The challenges should also correlate to how much they are worth. That being said, this is an excellent game.
B00304RMFE|4.0|Never played the game but like animation. Watched this and Halo 4: Forward unto Dawn and was totally pulled in. If MS decides to make more animations and/or live action I'll be first in  line.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed the book but there was too much jumping from one tragedy or bad happenings and no joy so to speak.
B0094K20FK|5.0|I am a old and faithful  Trekie and was glad to see this full length film with all the main character from the TV  series that I grew up with as a youth. Any one who likes Mr. Spock will be glad to hear his logical answers to their problems.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow, what can I say that hasn't already been said?! This is a very strange story and  the scary part is that there are people out there just like her!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like the game because it's fun but you also have to concentrated on the game so yeah really fun
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't stop watching...in a way I'm glad there are only a small numbers of.episodes a season; otherwise I'd never get any sleep!
1476733953|1.0|boring twenty times over,nothing happens,nothing happens,boring ,boring.<br />It's a long book about nothing,could not relate to the charaters ,could not relate to nothing
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Never got a chance to watch it when it was on.  Prime allowed me to catch up on a great series
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I recommend this novel to everyone looking to escape the humdrum of his/her daily routine through an exciting and memorable adventure. I always acquire so much knowledge about the world and its technological and scientific breakthroughs via James Rollins' books.<br />Bravo, James. You did it again!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|This is a great app.  I can pinpoint which posts the people respond to more and which ones created no interest.  Very important for my business
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|The DVD arrived as expected, no complaints<br />However, the disc was secured too tightly to the plastic case and in trying to remove the DVD broke in two....busted. Wasn't able to view :(
B007VDPE32|5.0|The songs are written well, catchy, yet pensive in ways.  He seems meditative and playful at the same time.<br />His voice is one that demands my attention, has such quality and is smartly sensuous and mood inspiring. &#34;Song of You&#34; is so beautiful in parts, it takes you away... like a kiss.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Great movie, good for repeat viewing.  Sweetly and completely told, with &#34;bad guys&#34; who redeem themselves, which is important for your young viewers.  We were reading the book, too, and it followed well enough to not be upsetting to my young listener.  It's pretty too look at and magical.  It's a keeper!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game!! Keeps you wanting to go back for more. Would recommend to anyone. 7 year old likes it too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it and completed all levels of it and am waiting for the update I just loved it hope the update comes soon
B004KPX4W2|2.0|With a cast like this, this movie should be wonderful! It's a pile of so many of my favorite actors. But it was simply boring. The plot made little sense, the relationships were barely developed, even the action sequences were less-than-active (except for a couple, and those were so fiercely violent and not in keeping with the movie they weren't fun.) We suffered through the whole thing, but knew after about the first half-hour we should really have moved on.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Look, calculators are meant to make life easier especially for math-challenged folk. This app delivers on all accounts. Great layout, simple buttons, what else is there to ask of a calculator other than a correct result? The best part? It's free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching and I love this show!!. Watched all three seasons and I wish there were more!!its worth watching!!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This is a good game for hand-eye coordination.  You have to focus on your target to send the bubble flying and tilting the device to drop the games is great.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|truly HD movie, me and my friends enjoy watching it. I connected my laptop using HDMI to my 55&#34; tv and the picture is still crystal clear, we love it
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|You can only cut so much hair with this app. It's not that interesting - but it keeps the kids busy
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game surly make you think and is very fun to play it took me a minute to get the hang of it but I did and very much like it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superbly written and performed by a stellar cast, each episode is a jewel.  I can't wait for each season to be released.
3836538725|4.0|The book deserved a better paper, at least the same material as used in Workers. In a humid environment the book will sooner or later curled due to the thin paper used. I have no other complain apart from that as the photographs and quality of print worth every penny I spent.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, much like all the rest, I am always amazed at the facts presented thru the book.  Keep them coming
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I like all of the Harry Potter movies they are suspenful, holds the attention of the viewer and is not at all what some religious persons would like viewers to believe.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I looked forward to going back to reading it.  The only thing was that some of the descriptions got a little too long.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Like that I can combine different sounds that are still soothing & allow me to rest or just fall asleep.
B005KB0SU6|3.0|La historia- aunque mucho muy distinta a la de La Sombra del Viento-- Tambien logra atraparte y se vuelve sumamente intrigante sobre todo en los ultimos capitulos. Fue una sorpresa descubrir que de cierto modo El Juego del Angel es una especie de precuela. Asi mismo tengo que admitir que el final me dejó con ciertas dudas.... Sería a caso por el exceso de \\"ciencia ficción\\"?  O por el escepticismo inherente al tema de la inmortalidad que te enseña la religion Católica???
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love being able to get the definition and synonym of a word at the drop of a hat.  I have this app on my phone as well.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This is really a hard game to play on my Kindle fire.  I don't like the way you have to try and more and then he doesn't even more the way you turn him.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I did not anticipate things to unfold as they did. However, I was pleased.  Matt and Marisa are great.  I don't care much for Ryan, but he got the job done.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Modern Vampires is different than the first two albums but definitely worth a listen.  It’s refreshing that a group doesn’t stick to the same formula on each record.  Dianne Young and Obvious bicycle are very catchy.  The first record is still my favorite but this one is still one to add to the collection.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Characters, Plot, Rivalries, Affairs, Corporate crimes and the Law, all fit in seamlessly. I didnt expect but found myself glued to the TV for hours until I finished the season.
0307352153|5.0|The author was really thorough with her research and included several real life examples when supporting her opinions about introverts and extroverts. As an introvert, there was a lot I could relate to. I'd like to hear an extrovert's opinion on this too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is filled with action, Katniss's conflicting emotions on who she loves and other things. If you liked the first book, definitely read this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a must see! But I warn you, if you begin reading the series, you won't be able to stop!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked the book once I was about 1/3 in. Then I really enjoyed how all the characters were intertwined. Very graphic and makes you think about poverty, drugs, family and belonging.
0684824906|5.0|Loved this book.  It took me a long time to read, but I really enjoyed the in-depth analysis of Lincoln's relationships and how he maximized each one for the country's advantage.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Item came slow maybe it was my anticipation for it. setting aside a item to watch it after re-watching the series.
0374203032|3.0|Good read, but not as insightful as I was hoping after reading Justice.  Didn't get the overall conclusion I was hoping he would expand upon.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Setting aside time to re-watch this now that I own it. Love me some Nathan Fillion and love that name too!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I love me some Kanye.  He is NOT afraid to step OUT OF THE BOX, name one other artist who does that. I see a lot of hater reviews on here but why? Cuz he's not cookie cutter? Cuz he doesn't REPEAT his success from the past? He is ALWAYS trying new things and no two CD's will probably ever be the same.  I like this about him.  I like the CD too.  I don't skip any songs.  Open your mind.  This CD is hot.
B00632HWOG|5.0|If you want to learn more about theology this book is for you. I've enjoyed taking my time in reading this book. I love the fact that it stimulates your thinking. Great book for a small bible study.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|as a fan of BBC dramas, I was ecstatic to see this series make multiple seasons and I hope it continues to for many years to come.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I liked this book. It's original and filled with imagination! The books I write are good, but I'm not an author yet.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|I'm about to stereotype myself ALL OVER this review.<br /><br />I loved the book because I thought it demonstrated the positive aspects of religion and spirituality, without implying that anyone has any idea of what may or may not be happening beyond the observable world.  For me, the defining characteristic of Pi in the book was his unflinching sense of wonder and his unbridled determination to enjoy his life.  He enjoyed spirituality, so he explored it.  He enjoyed biology, so he explored it.  Importantly however, the tone of his narration emphasized the wonder of exploring many world views, rather than the superiority of any one world-view.<br /><br />&#60;rant&#62;<br /><br />I thought the movie really gutted that message.  Pi's atheist teacher from the book was completely removed, and his pursuit of Islam was downplayed to the point that many viewers probably didn't even notice it.  There were also many lines that I felt implied that he favored his new-found Christianity over the Hinduism of his childhood.  I only read the book once and watched the movie once, but I don't remember the book having these dramatic moments where Pi shouts &#34;I surrender&#34; to god (singular).  The movie wreaked to me of pandering to an American, WASP, Disney-loving audience who wanted to see this young brown savage find salvation in their god.<br /><br />Yes, I was raised by American, WASP, Disney-loving people, and yes, who I am is very much a reaction to the negative aspects of that culture.  Take my review as you will.  I just think this movie is a disappointingly pale shadow of the book, and that it fails to capture even the spirit.<br /><br />It also wasn't nearly as pretty as I'd expected from the reviews.  Richard Parker was impressive, as were most of the animals.  On the other hand, endless standing water has to be one of the easiest things to accomplish with CGI.  There were several moments when I suspected that the producers assumed the audience would be awe-struck byan endless expanse, and would need a moment to take in the scene.  Instead, I quickly became bored and began contemplating just how lazy the shot was, and how much better it could have been if they'd played with the perspective and/or field of view.  The movement of the boat in the waves during the storms was also completely unrealistic.  I've seen video games with better in-game physics.<br /><br />I really thought that this movie was not worth the money or time.<br /><br />&#60;/rant&#62;
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Trying to explain it would sort of ruin it...it's how the story is told as much as what the story is that makes it so unforgettable and engrossing. Seriously, don't even peek at any Amazon reviews. Trust me on this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good season with some surprises. I was very upset the way the season ended, but I guess that is partly why I like the show. It isn't predictable.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very addicting game, but you don't get to play long before your cut right off and have to purchase the full game in order to continue.I wish they would release a full game that is totally free!<br />Or better yet somebody make a Zelda clone!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's better than temple run and subway surfers. It's so cute and very addicting. I like the different levels and that they don't start you from the beginning when u lose.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Has been long time I last read a novel that was so hard putting on the table. Really entertaining and surprising
B0011ZYIZQ|5.0|no one sweeter,has a voice worthy of an Angel. love everything she sings and buy everything she sings. the best love songs by a complete Artist
B000QCS8TW|5.0|While its a decent sized book, it does not fail to keep you engaged.  It emerges you into westeros in a way that the show can hardly scratch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it was very addicting and challenging at the same time. I can't wait for more levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game. It was hard enough to hold your interest without being all consuming. I will look for more from them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has quickly become one of my favorite shows. Lots of action humor and the sting of unrequited love and romance. This show has it all. The unforgetable characters have stuck with me. Great show great seller. thanks!
B00AVFO41K|4.0|Between the dreadful grammar in the product description and the high number of negative reviews, I was expecting much worse.  But, really, it's not all that bad.  No, there are no instructions.  That's not really a problem, though, as it took me one run through to get the idea.  There are balls of various colors, line up five to get points.  If you line up five, the row clears and no more balls pop up in that turn.  If you don't complete a row, more balls pop up.  There are power-up balls.  The bombs clear out big sections.  The ones with arrows clear out everything between them and the edge of the board in the direction the arrow is pointing.  The multicolor balls are like wild cards, they can be anything.  It's a very simple concept.  The objective is to earn as many points as possible before the board fills up with balls.  Once it does, the game is over.  One design flaw is that, if you have four balls lined up and the game puts a ball needed to complete the line in the correct spot, the line won't clear as it should.  That needs to be fixed in a future version.  All in all, it's not a bad time waster.  A solid 4/5 for me.
1616550414|5.0|I loved everything about it. Even a few family members that didn't like Zelda enjoyed this book. This book was spectacular.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Complete rooms to use as clues for your escape not just a small 2D space in frontof an elevator. Interesting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You must read before you watch the movie.  What a great love story. If you like Nicholas Sparks this book will not let you down.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Fractions adding and subtracting?  This app makes it so much faster and easier to do this.  I recommend for everyone.  BUT!!!  You should learn how to do manually too.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I received my copy of this movie from Netflix.  This review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />The fairy tale Hansel and Gretel was the worst case scenario straight from a kid's handbook on survival: You're out in the woods and discover a delicious house made out of candy and sweets.  It's like you died and went to heaven.  Then, you encounter the cannibal witch who lives inside.  And suddenly, you wish you'd stumbled upon a nice apple tree instead.  This witch has a thing for roasted kindergarteners, and right now you and your sibling are looking real tasty.  What do you do?<br /><br />The brother and sister duo serve up a little comeuppance in the opening scene of Hansel and Gretel:Witch Hunters.  From there, they answer a calling that includes hunting and destroying some really nasty looking ladies.  These magical wielding creatures make Bellatrix Lestrange, the Voldemort serving witch from Harry Potter, look like a very nice and pretty lady.  A trail of missing children always leads Hansel and Gretel to the guilty offender.  So, when a town begins noticing an unusually high number of child abductions, the mayor contacts Hansel and Gretel to solve the mysterious disappearances.<br /><br />But of course, there's a hater.  I mean, there's always a hater.  In this case, the local Sheriff is none too pleased to have the sister and brother butt-kicking team in his town.  He attempts to undermine their investigation at every opportunity.  Typical hater behavior.<br /><br />As Hansel and Gretel dig deeper into the cause of the kidnappings, they learn more and more about the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of their parents long ago.  Which up until this point, they've been a little bitter about.  I guess you would too if you were left behind in the woods with a witch who likes to ingest rug rats.  The two witch hunters manage to unravel the truth all while looking smoking hot in black leather.<br /><br />I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film with the negative reviews it received from critics.  Metacritic gave it an average score of 21 (out of 100), while Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 14% (out of 100%).  After watching the movie, I think the lower ranking scores are a little unfair.  I enjoyed Hansel and Gretel:Witch Hunters.  I appreciated the more action-packed approach they took to an old fairy tale.  There has been an emergence of modern fairy tales over the last few years on TV and in movies.  If you like shows like Grimm or Once Upon a Time, you should enjoy Hansel and Gretel.  I thought it was a much better adaptation than Red Riding Hood with Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman.<br /><br />The movie isn't bad.  The plot is a little predictable, and the focus is definitely on the action sequences.  But, it's like watching Expendables 2 and expecting an Oscar award winning performance from the cast.  Who does that?  You want explosions, barely audible one liners from Sylvester Stallone, and Jason Statham round housing villains in the forehead, right?<br /><br />Hansel, played by Jeremy Renner (Avengers, Hurt Locker) had great sibling chemistry with Gretel, played by Gemma Arterton (Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia:Sands of Time).  There were also good supporting performances from other actors.  The haterade Sheriff was none other than Peter Stormare, who tends to always play \\"that Russian guy\\" or some other form of Eastern European/Scandinavian character.  In fact, he was the Russian astronaut in Armageddon.  I had a hard time seeing the sexy Famke Janssen play an ugly witch.  But, the talented actress pulls it off, and pretty much makes you want to punch her in the face.  A lot.<br /><br />The movie is definitely full of blood and gore.  Be warned if you're squeamish.  While the film takes place in a medieval-like setting, the society has gadgets and weapons with modern ingenuity that were very tongue in cheek.  I'm still trying to figure out where Gretel got those hot leather pants.  I say this so you're not sitting there like, \\"C'mon! Where did Gretel get hot leather pants?\\"  Don't take this move too seriously.  Sit back, relax, eat your microwave movie butter popcorn, turkey dogs, and Rotel nacho dip, and enjoy.

B004KA9MQO|5.0|good good love this cd love it the track about the ole man is good and the wedding song song
B002ZG9968|5.0|To begin with I like both actors in the movie. It was refreshing to see a movie without a lot of sex and violence. Just a good story about 2 people who meet and in spite of the circumstances get it all worked out.
B00204AA0O|4.0|I can listen to the album straight through over and over. Not a bad track on the album.  I definitely need to get more of her albums.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Decent action movie, but it has a rather uninspired storyline and makes a complete hash of the old Norse myths. The spinning dome at the base of the bridge was meant to look impressive, but seemed to exist solely to show off CGI effects.
B00000IZOR|1.0|The makers of this toy NEVER tested it with an actual toddler...it's evident. Although I understand the safety reason for the short blue cord to the actual handheld receiver- a child doesn't. I bought this for my grandson and he has hit himself in the head over and over. I finally just threw it away. The base is very heavy, as soon as he picked up the receiver CLONK! then the cries. I guess it was marketed to Toddlerz with a &#34;z&#34; not an &#34;s&#34; ...not sure how old those lil' critters are or what they look like but my family hated this product.
B005HYNCTA|4.0|First of all, I would mean as \\"uneven\\" some choices from this box:  It would be possible to place into the last disc something Hungarian else than rehersals. For God`s sake, CD5 has just 28 minutes for Nutcracker Suite, when there were many options. Should it be Tchaikovsky, why not Manfred?  Well, may be Celi has never recorded it, as he did not Bruckner ´s and Tchaikovsky`s symphonies  1 and 2. However, by no means Nutcracker Suite alone is an intelligent alternative, even for ancient ages.<br />  All French music, despite tiresome Ravel Bolero, are welcome and well played.<br /><br /> Prokofiev `s  5th is gorgeous.<br />  Yes, we know Celi is the king of idiosyncrasy, meanwhile some people say he makes everything in the same shape,\\"as does Karajan\\". Well, this could be a \\"quality standard matter\\"...<br /><br />  One could ask why are there Shostakovitch symphonies 1 and 9 instead of other symphony by Dmitry... more suitable to Celi sluggish grandeur. May be there are no recordings whatsoever.<br /><br />Tchaikovsky last symphonies: The Fourth is obviously slow in first movement, sensitive, despite abrasive at Fate´S fanfarre and fast at Coda. Last movement seemed to me more vulgar than usually, due to \\"staccato\\" evidence for the folk theme.<br /> The Fifth is good, very thoughtful in the less important 1st mov; Slow movement is correct, though it made me recall Stravinsky ´s statement \\"How can we like so a popular work as Beethoven`s 5th?\\".<br />The valse is unimportant. Finale has proper solemnity in Celi`s slow path.<br /> As for \\"Pathetique\\", we have a very long and dramatic 1st mov, touching, moving, thrilling, as well as the final adagio is not as slow as Bernstein`s, yet properly underlined as \\"Tchai`s Requiem\\".<br />  Meaning there are 11 CDs,nevertheless they could be 9, it is a very economic and impressive  option even if you have already some items elsewhere.<br /><br />Flávio José Morsch<br />Santa Cruz do Sul, Brasil
B000SLP4SE|4.0|I like the pace of the movie and the story. The action was good and it makes you wonder if it mirrors real life situations.
B0074FEMA8|5.0|any fan of dune will want to read this book.<br />Ominus makes agent smith in the matrix look like a toy
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A funny, interesting quick read.  If you like Tina Fey on SNL or 30 Rock, you will enjoy this book.  Lots of Tinaisms as well as some interesting behind the scenes glances into the above mentioned shows.  Good read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's really cool. The graphics are amazing, and I like how it twists and turns and goes up and down. One thing I would suggest though is making the pause menu like the first one, where you can see your objectives because otherwise you have to die to see them. Great app though!!!

B009G41CG2|5.0|I love this version of Mahjong. ONe of the big things is the many possible variations of the layouts. I've found one that I can win about eighty percent of the time, which makes it a lot more fun than losing all the time. I play this on a new Kindle fire I got for Father's Day, and I am still struggling to get the right &#34;touch&#34; for moving things around. However, I m getting there, and this is a fun game. AND FREE! Get it!
B004G7UTXG|4.0|This film was recommended to me by a history professor. It is a great film and was very entertaining. I rate it four stars.
B003XDXVXO|4.0|worth the time to watch.  you will enjoy it and has great parts in it - take the time to watch
B00B7Y0206|2.0|At first I loved the app. It was a great easy way to watch videos; I was able to login to my account. One day I accidentally logged out and it hasn't played a video since. Although right before the login catastrophe it was taking forever to play videos.
161655164X|5.0|I always enjoy going into the minds of the artists who helped flesh out the look of a great game. This books is just gorgeous.
0739366408|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to these audiobooks on my daily commute. They are well acted & the material provides an interesting insight into what would happen in the case of a global pandemic.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Besides the fact that both my wife and I loved this movie it was a little annoying with the constant dialog.  Then why the 5 star review?  Two reasons... 1.  Once one just accepts the constant chatting and just buys into what is going on and let it be, it is wonderful.  2. It reminds me of my own relationship  and how it started (a lot of chatting) and then you add the first movie (Before Sunrise) and the current release (Before Midnight) by same team we really see how relationships can grow (or not).  Bottom line - loved them all.
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|I personally didn't care for this movie. The acting was great, but I didn't like the story. With this said, I DID get super fast shipping and it arrived as described.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Like action figure toys, your favorite movie heroes are back for another go around. While half the Bulgarian cast is wiped out, they hardly suffer a scratch. Mindless entertainment, but the action is relentless. They must have drawn straws for this, and this time, Jean Claude Van Damme gets to be the villain and does a great job. Great for popcorn movie night!

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game it's so addictive. It has great features. It was definitely worth the five bucks. But if you don't your kid with violence games I wouldn't recommend this game

B00AVTMB4I|5.0|it follows the book very well and I recommend the book it is also a great read and good to share with friends who are goin threw a hard time (:
B000002IPZ|5.0|Despite the band and other negative reviews this is actually my favorite Testament record. I think it's better than most if not everything else. Chuck's vocals are amazing and the guitar work is phenomenal. The songs are catchy and heavy. It's never been a bad day to own Souls Of Black.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Like the free app but needs to let you play longer or find a way to earn extra playing<br />time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Since I got this game I've been happy it actually was the first game I got everyone that's thinking about buying this game should.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's just like the Xbox 360. The graphics are awesome the game is awesome. Give me  one good reason it's bad and if you do all I have to say to you is What the juice is wrong with you!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|It was probably the best book I have ever read and will read. I couldn't put it down. It's so realistic. I love all the characters and how it ends. I defiantly advise getting this book.
1451626657|2.0|This is certainly no ordinary book. It must have been hilarious for many people as I read in lots of reviews and in the back cover that says \\"one of the funniest books ever written\\". To tell you the truth, it was very hard for me to find the fun or even a fake smile. During some paragraphs, the story of Yossarian (a pilot in WW2 trying to escape the horror of war) became interesting but most of the time I felt an inner struggle on whether to put down the book or not. Incredibly, I forced myself to read it completely so I could give an opinion. And here I am, after 452 pages, sharing my complete indifference for Heller's bestseller. My early thoughts were confirmed, unfortunately.
B00821OX98|2.0|The vampire and monster fans might even yawn through this show. This show is so formulaic it's as if you've seen it before -- a thousand times. If you like soap opera relationships and cookie cutter characters having their &#34;actor moments&#34; repeatedly, then you'll like it. Don't look for action, because they're ain't much. Hoaky, silly, with awful directing and writing. Geez, did they just steal scripts from Lost in Space?
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This &#34;sport(fans) romance&#34; gets a bit crude in spots, but has a few surprise twists and a feel-good outcome. Good acting all the way around, especially DeNiro, who manages to allow the character to outshine the actor...excellent performance.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a great game! if you like puzzles, you'll like this one.  works great on my Kindle.  can't wait for the next one!
B002MU4NL8|1.0|Besides the prices?  (Currently $9 v $24).<br /><br />I looked at the images of the back of the package on both, and they both list the same special features.<br /><br />Also, the movie isn't 25 years old -- so how can they have a 25th anniversary edition?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- I love this movie and am buying a copy (of the $9 version); I'm just trying to warn people off spending an extra $15 unnecessarily.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|everyone have this game because it is awesome and it as grate graphics. and it shows younthe dinosaurs. that you to be on this earth
0316044938|4.0|SPOILER ALERT*** Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is not an easy read, not in the least. I felt that the rape and murder of the main character was grueling to get through. Even worse, I found the ending, with the mother abandoning the family because she couldn't handle the pain of it all was just awful. I understand what Sebold is trying to do here: paint the issues realistically, and show how much the loss of a child can rip the fabric of a family apart. Fine--I get it. But I found it dispiriting and difficult to believe.<br /><br />All those things aside, this is a very solid work of literary fiction. The characters are well-drawn and complicated. The scenes in heaven were beautiful and thought-provoking. The hell of rape is true, and one I know well.<br /><br />Gah! Four stars seems a bit low for this book, but I just couldn't click five.<br /><br />E.L. Farris<br />Author of Ripple
B005LAIH2C|3.0|I didn't go in expecting too much so I wasn't disappointed.  I went in for the entertainment factor and the &#34;fairy tale&#34; background.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Damian Stevenson's \\"Solstice\\" is an edge-of-your-seat psychological suspense tale.  It's the story of Dana Barnes, a troubled young woman who we first meet just as she's leaving \\"Expedition House\\" - a rehab/psychological treatment center.<br /><br />She checks into a motel with her boyfriend, who she argues with, and then who's nowhere to be found in the morning.  But it's a small town, and there's no buses or trains for him to get away on; his car is still there; even his wallet is still in the room.  Where could he have gone?  Dana goes to the local authorities, who conduct a search for him with no luck, and, worse, no proof that there ever even was a boyfriend.  Dana ends up at the nearby \\"Rainbow\\" community - a commune where her sister Zoe is living, and which takes her in while helping her to search for her boyfriend.  And then the trouble really starts...<br /><br />The book is suspenseful from beginning to end.  The author creates a believably troubled heroine, who isn't necessarily the most reliable narrator, adding to the tension.  The commune is believable as well; it rings true from stories of such places in real life.  And the psychological elements - questions of Dana's sanity and her reactions to what's going on around her - are very well handled.  The writing is crisp and clear; there's well-done action and compelling character moments as well.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book (but unless you'd like nightmares of your own, I'd recommend reading it in a well-lighted room with other people nearby!)
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have always loved this game been playing it for years and now I get to play on my brand new kindle, and I can see all the tiles and the color is great I Will keep this one!

B008JFUQZ2|5.0|If you ever watched a Godzilla movie, or any other giant monster movie, and wanted to see what it might look like with today's special effects, grab your popcorn and check out Guillermo del Toro's \\"Pacific Rim.\\"<br /><br />In the near future, Earth faces invasion from giant monsters (Kaiju), who emerge from the ocean and wreak havoc on coastal cities.  The humans create giant robot Jaegers to fight them.  For a while this works, but the monsters grow stronger and once again overwhelm the humans.  Pacific Rim follows a former robot jockey who is called back to duty as the human defenses dwindle.....<br /><br />I've looked forward to this movie for a long time, as I loved the giant monster movies of my youth.  This didn't disappoint.  Interesting and intimidating Kaiju, unique and powerful Jaegers, well choreographed fight scenes, and awesome special effects combine to make this a fantastic summer movie.  There were several scenes which had the audience cheering and applauding.<br /><br />I've rated this 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a deep character-driven film, this might not be for you.  I would question why you are going to a giant monster vs. giant robot movie for that.  If you want to see utter destruction and great fight scenes, you really cant' go wrong with Pacific Rim.<br /><br />I saw this in the theater in 3D, and while the 3D was prevalent and pretty good, it faltered when the scenes called for 3D and subtitles.  Nevertheless, it is highly worthy not only of seeing in a theater (the scenes will not play as well on a smaller screen) but it is also worth paying the extra price for 3D (something I don't say often).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I really love this game. The graphics, th  interface, everything! It's very similar to Black ops an  I love that you play online with different people
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love the show!  no more babies, will edith find love at last, can't wait to see how next season turns out...
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Visually it is a beautiful movie that is fast paced throughout. The transition from &#34;home&#34; to Oz is well done and fun.
B005FITIF0|5.0|Great Movie. I have been looking for this movie not realizing I could find it on Amazon. When I heard of it in 2011 I could not find it in a movie theater. This movie was not widely released.  Gerald Butler is fabulous as the preacher. This is a attention grabber.  From one selfish man to one who gives his life to saving children. He would move hell and high water if he could to save every child no matter the cost. Worth every dollar spent. I have shared this movie with many friends they were all entranced could not take their eyes off the film no bathroom breaks with this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just started playing this game, and it's already my favorite! It has great graphics, and you can ride your horse; unlike Howrse.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I downloaded this game and quickly was addicted I  however could not merge with my Facebook since I  deleted it. After using a  great deal of my free time and spending a good deal of money all of my progress was lost due to a game update.Most disappointing experience with any app
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a casual user of Pinterest - but I like using it on my tablets more than my computer.  I can see why people love Pinterest.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Finished this book in a day and a half, and I'm anxiously waiting to read the next one.<br />Parts in the book were hilarious.  Loved the interaction between the robot and Cinder.<br />Great story and you don't need to be a fan of the fairy tales to enjoy the book.<br />Problems:<br />1. This is very petty, but the book seems to be located in China, but there are aspects of other Asian cultures especially concerning the imperial family.  I'm just not a big fan when books, movies, etc., try to integrate them altogether.  I would rather people did their research.  But again, this is fantasy so I try and let it go.<br />2. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters when death was involved.  To be honest, I felt more sad for myself because that character wouldn't be in any conversations anymore.  But I never felt the other characters deserved my sympathy.<br />3. There were times that I either had to shut the book or yell at it, because I was annoyed at Cinder, and how incapable she thought she was.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|A beautiful body of work by Tom on his first Solo Album, he has written a lot of the songs with his Wife, who also sings on the album.<br /><br />If you did the bluesier work of Cinderella, then you will absolutely love this Album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the calculator because the numbers are large, easy to use if you have large hands, and easy to conduct mathematical calculations.
B00ABJWQXO|2.0|This case came free with my Nexus 4 phone. It is a great case except for one fatal flaw. The earphone jack cutout is too small for the audio cable I use in my car. I can probably buy a cable with a thinner jack, but why? But what other things that I will plug into the earphone jack won't fit? The case fit great, the buttons worked like it was naked, but now I have to get a new Audio cable or a new case. I am giving it a 2, but if the earphone cutout is not an issue for you, its a 5
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game. I would like to see a silver coin to gold coin conversion option though.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Try it for three episodes, it should be easy for you to judge if the show is for you... enjoy
0937381888|5.0|This was the first book I read when I decided I wanted to make real beer (not the cheap-kit-with-a-plastic-keg-looking-fermenter that will not be named).  The book is easy to understand for a beginner, but the later sections got a lot more technical, which I went back and read later as I learned.  When I decided to go from extract to all-grain brewing this was again my go-to book.  10 years of non-stop brewing and I still use this book as a reference with almost every batch.  I recommend this book to any of my friends that talk about or do take up brewing.<br /><br />You can read the 1st edition of his book for free on his website, which is where I started.  I ended up using his site so much I decided at one point that I owed it to him to buy the book.  I didn't realize there was a lot more in the printed version than on the site or I would have bought it long ago.  I would recommend checking out his site, it will definitely get you going on brewing.  If you like his style of writing, the book is worth more than the cost.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun.The only thing is I can never defeat Vector because I either don't pay attention or his bomb robot comes up behind me and I don't move quick enough.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Just like the first two seasons, this one delivers. Worth the price, looks amazing. CBS digitals conversion was probably the best i've seen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I live this game-- but I sat down and finished all of the rooms in less than an hour! please add more rooms!!!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Best Disney movie I've seen in a while.(Coming from an adults point of view.) Beautiful costumes, set, and graphics. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00CS65QGW|4.0|Its a nice tune, but I just it doesn't suffer for over exposure.  I hope people in the media/Entertainment realize its a song by Daft Punk, featuring Parrell, not the other way around!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Saw the play and wanted the CD.  This is original broadway cast.  Love the music.  Delivered fast so I could enjoy it sooner.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|When I the learn function and teach the wand a command, it gives me not 1 but 2 big pulses. Then when I for instance, tap the wand to channel up, it goes up 2 channels. Tap the side for channel down? Goes down 2. Flick up for volume up? Goes up 2 lines. Flick down? Down two lines.<br /><br />Everything is happening twice. Anyone encounter this? Am I doing something wrong or do I need a new wand?
B003MS7V8G|4.0|I watched the movie because I've been listening to the soundtrack from it for years.  If you're looking for chill background music, I highly recommend it for its Brazilian jazz.  The story line borders on lame but it kept my attention.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|What could I possibly say about this book that has not already been said? I can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading it.<br /><br />Apparently I cannot tell you anything about it though.<br />See rule 1 and 2.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|No fun at all. No music no instruction no logic no quality control no effort in game development no reason to download
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was told I HAD to read this book, that it was GREAT! However, I found it to be not very good. If you want to read about two people having sex every second of the day then this is the book for you. Then the end of it is so abrupt that you are left like huh? I'm not even going to bother with the trilogy...
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was very good.  It continued the story from BOOk one perfectly. There were surprises, happy and sad.  I  think anyone who liked book 1 will like this. Going to start book 3 next.
0345529057|5.0|So far I have found that the books are interesting and fun to read. Shipping worked well regardless of my remote location and the books were in pristine condition on arival. The case is surpisingly useful for makeshift housing of the books.
B001MYKZ6C|1.0|Do not buy from this seller. The DVD didn't even work. Luckily I only paid a few bucks for the DVD so it didn't hurt in the end. But I will never purchase from them again
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is seriously so addictively fun, it's hard to stop playing haha. I love it and you won't be able to not love it too!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Crashes my entire phone very time I run it.  Over a year and no updates that fix it.  Milestone x2 w/ gingerbread.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|I am glad this was the free app of the day as I would be mad if spent money on it. There is no tutorial and no apparent rules. You open it and.... bang....the game starts. If I understood it better it may be more fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yaaaa finally it on Kindle Fire I'm so happy that they finally put it on there I have it on my phone and I was waiting for them to put Despicable Me :Minion Rush Haas thank you thank you lol
B000066NW0|5.0|A truly great musical performer. This musical disk shows how wonderfully varied Avril's abilities really are. The songs are NOT cookie-cutter duplications - each has it's own distinct flavor.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great action movie, great sound, great animation, fair plot.  Overall ... movie to enjoy at least twice.  Not Bad at all.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Good to hear it on  Sat. morning.  I did see the movie, and listening to it makes one sad to think that Rodriguez had all this talent and went nowhere.  It is kind of dated, but it's kind of like listening to old Bob Dylan records, there is no statute of limitations.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as did my husband. Julianne Hough did a very good job. Though sort of predictable, it was a story worth watching.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Th book is lovely. Slow paced, with language that is so beautiful I found myself 're-reading sentences just to feel them better. If you enjoy bittersweet deep character studies, you will like this book.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I adored this novel. Eleanor & Park seemed like they could truly be two of my high school students. I liked that they were written with obvious strengths and flaws, and with true teenage angst.<br /><br />I felt cut off at the end, but I can understand why it was written that way. We can kind of finish the story in our own way.<br /><br />5 stars
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a good idea to get this game. The game is free. Good job on making it. It's a good game
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|I have a 5 year old daughter, and she loves it.. It makes cute noises and graphics as well.  I think it also increases the amount of fruits and veggies that need to be grown.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun but it seems a lot like dragonvale,also,those adds keep popping up at the beginning should have an option to be switched off.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I felt the book was good, I felt I was there sometimes in that era. It was very sad to know that people actually died from those sicknesses.
B007STBUIW|5.0|A great movie at a good price. Where would I be without that heart pounding, gut wrenching musical score for Jaws.
B007MDK4XQ|4.0|Going through the same experience with my husband who has esophogeal cancer , I found the book to be truthful and accurate...no sugar coating but not depressing.
193700788X|3.0|Given the second to last book, I had a horrible feeling what was coming. Which is why I chose to wait to read the book until was I was ready--several weeks after actually buying it.  As are most fans, I am disappointed with her HEA choice. In the end Sam is more of a brother than anything else so the 'love' scene was just 'ick'. Might as well have been Claude.  I think it would have been more realistic to have her end up w/no HEA--open to the future and who it might hold.  I too have no idea what happened to Eric of most of the series--the final book castrates him. In the end though, it was just a bizarre way to deal with the HEA portion of the storyline--I am honestly confused by the last 20 pages of the book.<br />If you want a great series w/a great ending-not necessarily a HEA ending but an awesome ending, stick to the Fae Fever series by Moning. THERE is a way to end a series with a heorine who has evolved into a strong woman.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Pretty good album.  I feel like it's not fully complete and a few songs were meh, but overall it's great music and worth having.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|my husband loves hem has wacthed them at least 4 or 5 times already can't wait for the third season
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is becoming my absolute favorite. Plus they don't bombard us with commercials like other shows. I would highly recommend it.
B000UX6THK|5.0|For anyone who had a fondness for twin peaks from the 90s I highly recommend  this for your collection or even as a killer gift. Being reminded of how charming, quirky, twisted and beautiful this series was in yesteryear has bought me much fulfilment. I simply love this show and I forgot how much. I'm inspired to collect and read all the diaries and the prequel fire walk with me after I finish the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging with out being impossible.  My only complaint is the lack of levels. Hate when apps come out and only have a few levels available and just say wait.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am loving these books. The imagery lets my mind create the pictures as the words dance along the page. The story line is easy to follow and is not always predictable. Favorite characters are just as likely to get killed as your favorite villains. Full of old English type words this book is not only stimulating my imagination but expanding my vocabulary. I love it and will seek out other books by the same author when I've finished these 4.
1844488748|5.0|All of the pictures are wonderful.  Quite frankly I just like to look at them.  The instructions are reasonable, although reading them through several times seems necessary.  There are many pictures to help achieve the desired results.  Quite frankly they stand so far proud of the fabric that I haven't decided where I can use them, but if you love silk flower embroidery you'll probably think of something.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Interesting story line providing good clean light entertainment.  Great for a relaxing evening yet leaves you wanting to see the next show.
B008602KQI|5.0|Outside of being a great movie, it was easy and smooth to watch via streaming to my Mac in private.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|What an awesome study Bible! The amazing amount of information on here has educated me a great deal about the bible.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|I played this soundtrack over and over; I never get tired of it! This cd is mixed perfectly. I love the game and just to hear some of the songs without the explosions and sound effects were awesome. I do not have a favorite track. They are all my favorite. Especially, &#34;Collective Consciousness.&#34; Awesome lines and awesome delivery would be get for anyone who likes video game soundtracks.
B008KE3960|5.0|He figured out how to map routes (5yrs old 2day) Battles and wins with his routes. So Im saying great game like the last one. (Sonic)<br />He plays it forever like sonic.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Did not get a chance to see this when it was at the theater but wanted to see it before Red 2 came out.  Amazon Instant Video was a great way to catch up.  This is a classic spy spoof with just enough action to make it an action movie and just enough comedy to make it fun.
B008K8U13K|5.0|Got this on my tablet for my 5 yr old grandson who loves it and plays it for hours. He is above average in games on line. So when something like this keeps him playing for along time it has to be good.
1427215006|5.0|This book flew by, my husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  We have now ordered &#34;Scarlet&#34; the 2nd Lunar book and cant wait to see what happens next.  All of my 5 married daughters have read it and they loved it too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Extremely easy to use.  I love the way it bookmarks where you are, even when you switch from phone to computer.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This is the second hair salon game I got on my kindle, I got it just to compare. and this one is by far worse. it has very had controls compared with the other app, toca hair salon 2, which I LOVE. the graphics are very poor also compared with toca hair salon 2. and on this app, it takes forever to switch from one gauget to the next. on the second app, many were included on one page, that were alleasy to navigate from since there is only 6. and one the other app, you can wash their hair, and YOU DONT HAVE TO UNLOCK ANYTHING!!! the only downside to the other app is it costs money to get it, but this one is free, but u can spend money IN the app. so my conclusion is.... don't waste time on this poorly made app, toca hair salon 2 ismuch better in lots of ways.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is amazing. I don't know why everyone isn't watching it....really!<br />The writing is smart and funny. It has heart, but isn't cheesy.  Every character on this show is richly written and acted. Can't wait for season three!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|omg my dad and everyone in my fam  loves this game they always take my ipod to play this game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very adventurous. It's a whole new world. Definitely hard to put down once you start reading it. I will be reading more from this author.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Always been a big fan of Jane Austen books, so I'm glad to be able to have all of them for free on my Kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome fun and cool i have so many coins and people!!!! Thanks for the game!!!!!!!!!! I play it all the time!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Once you start , You will not stop reading till the end. Excitement in every page. Will recommend to friends who are into this kind of novel.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellant book. I'm not bug on fiction fantasy stories but this book grabbed my attention in just a few pages. I can't wait to finish.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|With each new Rollins novel I am reminded why he is my favorite writer. Every book is absolutely spellbinding and  filled with so many interesting facts. I always find myself looking up so many cool places and phenomena while reading his books. Thanks for another winner!
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot Lee Child writes so well you cant stop reading and i am sure we all have the perfect image of Jack<br />Reacher in our own imagination and he is the ultimate hero cant wait for the next read Mr Childs dont you dare kill him off.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I love the series and will buy all of them.  Tom Selleck is a great actor in any movie he is in.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's been a fun game so far I think I'll try some of their other games I heard of a game called doomsday preppers wish they put out on here so I can get. It
B001CEE1YE|5.0|I'm a Matrix fanatic so I had to get this trilogy. The collection was a great deal because the picture and sound quality that it delivered was so much better than the other Matrix DVDs that I purchased in the past. If you're a Matrix fan, you won't be disappointed in this trilogy.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Don't get for a kindle Fire doesn't have a microphone so won't talk back. Good for potions and anything else.
B00C6B8TB8|5.0|If you're a Marvel HULK fanatic, then this steelbook is for you.The Incredible Hulk is my favorite Marvel character and I was happy to see him in live-action. I'm thankful to add this steelbook to my blue ray collection. The movie was incredible indeed, with such intense action and I like the fact that it went with the comics. But I wasn't very fond of the new cast members. Unlike the regular hulk blue ray movie, this steelbook gives you the ability to see the film on your phone, computer, tv and even online with Ultraviolet. So it was definitely worth buying.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|please bring back older version!  this update is awful!  where is the &quot;in season&quot; pollen report??  I have uninstalled.  is there a way to get the older version??
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I've seen this on big screens many times and suffered through it on broadcast TV with commercial breaks. Watching in HD with a scotch in hand was a great way to spend an evening. Ilsa is stunning. If you have never seen this without commercial breaks you owe it to your self to find two quiet hours to enjoy it.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I really like the ease of playing this game. It is one of my favorites! I recommend it to my friends and family
B007HYV56U|5.0|This movie has a great blend of racing action and off track storyline. Jessica Walter in an early role is a treat.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After the first two books I had high expectations for this one.  It was okay.  I will read the 4th as well, but this one wasn't as good as the first 2.
B0092SQ5EG|1.0|watched 2 minutes of it, I want my 2 minutes back; THATS how horrible this crap is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also the movie seems to be so dully made, the ending is probably the best part.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book! I have told everyone I know to read this. Such a heart warming tale of love, loss and life.<br />A great perspective from the silent observer. This book was an excellent mix of funny and emotional. Don't want to give away the plot but really is a must read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it doesn't have any glitches and the animation runs smoothly. my kid loves this game and so do I !
B00973DDN2|4.0|Good album, not their best work but it's solid. Coming off Brandon Flowers solo album and Day & Age, its a VERY slight let down but would recommend to all Killers fans
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Before I purchased born sinner I knew that I liked the small amount of j. Cole that I had already heard previously. . So I decided to go ahead and purchase this album... best decision ever :)<br />J cole is a great lyricist, he is clever, uncensored, and real... not to mention that he's a talented producer as well.<br />All I have been listening to is this album, its addicting and so easy to relate to. I definitely recommend it!!
B0056FMNYA|5.0|This is simply the best product out on the market. I've tried most of them!<br />Pro's include that it is light, VERY sturdy, works with nearly any belt, is a pick pocket deterrent while travelling, and has never dropped my camera even when I'm using my Canon 5D Mark III with a 70-200mm L series lens. Yes, it can hold that much weight even while I lean on the camera and walk around!<br /><br />Con's include that it isn't cheap, but you do get what you pay for. It only comes in black.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|my favorite movie of all time.  a wonderful story about acceptance and community, love and family.  Cinematography of just superb
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I didn't set high expectation for this usb dac/amp as I bought this to solve the audio issue with my laptop. My company laptop, dell E6400, takes for ever to boot up due many installed security software so I normally put it in hibernate mode and the audio stops working unless I reboot it.<br />I used to have a little usb dac which gets so many positive reviews but I was disappointed, see my review if you are curious what I bought, so I learned the lesson.<br />I did researches on usb dac + headphone models and found the E17 stays on top:<br /><br />- good price especially I got a deal on ebay<br />- powered headphone amp<br />- multiple input formats<br />- good usb dac 24/96<br />- bass/treble control<br />- digital volume control<br />- nice brushed aluminum case<br />- good reviews<br /><br />I have been using the amp for a week and I decided to write a little review sooner as I am very happy with the purchase.<br />I admitted that I was skeptical about my choice since it has both usb-dac+ headphone amp for such affordable price. I wasn't looking for a \\"wow\\" but I don't want to compromise the sound quality with decent headphones: ATH-A900X and ATH-M50S. I know people will question about the credibility of my review as I am happy with the sound from the dell E6400. Who would believe a guy who likes that sound from a laptop?<br />I really hesitate to say this but the E17 does improve the sound quality a bit. It's not night and day but I was able to tell from a certain songs. The sound is cleaner, sound stage is wider, vocal is fuller. The high frequency is not rolling off early and the bass is very solid and punchy. I think the internal battery does make a different especially the bass.<br />I can verify the USB dac supports 24bit audio stream when I enable it in windows 7 thanks to the LED screen.<br />I wasn't looking to use the stand alone headphone amp but I did a quick test to compare with the Sansa view. At the same volum,. I can feel the Sansa works really hard to drive my headphones while the E17 works with ease and fuller.<br />I don't have the correct adapter to get the line out from my iphone or the Sansa to test E17 amp w/o being amplified in previous stage.<br />One of the reviewer mentioned that he couldn't use the usb dac unless it's fully charge but it's not true. The E17 battery was empty when I got it and I was able to use it after charging it for 5 minutes.<br />I would say I am happy with the E17 for the same money with more features and sound quality when compared to the other similar models out there.<br /><br />Do I believe those people who couldn't tell the difference? Yes, I believe so. I had to sit in a very quiet room, switch back and forth so many times in order to hear the difference so I doesn't make much different when it's in noisy environment and busy doing something else.<br /><br />Update 7/12/2013<br />Last night I switch back and forth between the E17 and the Dell E6400(with IDT chip) and I found the the music from E17 is better, I hesitate to say \\"much better\\".<br />And today I spent several hours listening to the music at work with ATH-M50s w.o feeling tired. I couldn't do the same with my E6400 internal sound card, my ears really want to tell me to stop after 1-2 hours. When working, I don't pay attention much to the music as when doing the testing but the sound is smooth and clear so that I don't need to take it off.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really cute especially minions but it's really challenging to the part when your suppose to defeat vector but other then that I like it
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Nowhere as bad as the reviews led me to expect. Yes, it's not as clever as the first ones, but there is a good twist or two in it.<br /><br />The estranged-father-son banter gets tiring fast, especially the one where his son is wounded and needs a bullet removed. That was poorly written and annoying. The whole father-son thing was not too believable anyway.<br /><br />There's some strange stuff - (minor spoiler) I'm not clear on how John's tiny vehicle causes a huge vehicle to go out of control.<br /><br />But it was entertaining enough.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is an amazing game and that it is perfect for horse lovers and people who like a good fun challenge!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good fun very fun to play a y always able to keep.playing very addicting  my favorite game ever  I wish they would. Make a movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run it is a really fun game I like the old temple run but I like the temple run 2 it have one HUGE monkey a zipline it is so cool I recommend this to everyone!!!!!!!!!!
B0038UNNBM|5.0|This was perfect for my patio as it has a blow up bubbly bottom. It's not huge, but that's what I was looking for. The sun shelter is great as a nice patch of sun still hits the front. It was easy to get the water out of in order to clean (I didn't find a plug, just pushed the side down with my foot). I am very happy.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Book is funny and sincere, I could actually hear Tina Fey speak while reading. Even though some parts are culture specific to US, it still is hilarious.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Preview:<br /><br />Mia seems to have lost everything, including herself, in the blink of an eye. A horrifying car accident leaves her mother with immediate cardiac arrest and her father's brain across the pavement. Mia finds herself living as somewhat of a ghost, watching her own bloodied, broken body, and which is in a coma, and the people around her through a one-way mirror. When her peculiar, but compassionate nurse tells her grandparents that the medical talk doesn't matter, and that in the end it is Mia who decides, Mia realizes that it is she who must make the ultimate choice: To wake from her coma and continue life with a crater in her heart, or join her family? To live with her friends, or die along with her parents and brother? To stay, or to go?<br /><br />After all, dyeing is easy; living is hard.<br /><br />In the end, Mia must choose between her families: To stay, with her grandparents, best friend, and boyfriend; or to go, with her kind-hearted father, fiery mother, and a little brother who is more of a son than a sibling.<br /><br />Is it no man left behind?<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />This book touches on a disturbing subject with gentle fingers. There is just enough hard truth to be raw, without being brutal. Mia had many flashbacks and encounters with old memories throughout the story, which Gayle Forman managed to keep clean and cut, to avoid confusion with the present and the now. Description in this story was quite beautiful as well, with eloquent word choice and overall quality writing. This book was thought-provoking and emotional. I highly suggest you read it, because you won't be able to put it down
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I gave it 5stars because its super fun and I love it.I hope you guys like it when you play it. bye
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have a kindle fire and I was just looking for a simple calculator app for when I need it for my online school for math. I came across this app and it was exactly what I needed. There is a reason this app is ★★★★★. It is totally worth the download. I would pay $10,000,000 for it if it was that much because it is totally worth it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had a good read with this book. Am very glad that l have this classic finished. Now the movie.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game and I had to pay 2.99 for it and that is the only bad thing about it so I think its worth the price because I absolutely love it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a truly great book.  I tore through it and was sorry to finish.  Looking forward to more of his work.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Not quick enough for this game. Die too fast. Maybe if I could slow it without getting killed  so fast I would enjoy it more.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Will buy the next season.  First saw it on TV, the 5th season, so we started buying the back seasons and have been enjoying every season
B00D41H2PS|1.0|Can't get pass the first room. Can't rate what I can't play. Needs better hints so one can proceed further. Cannot rate this game
1444723537|1.0|Not all versions of this book contain the story \\"Rage\\".  I wish the individual sellers would indicate this. I now have a book with all of the stories I've already read, except the one I wanted.
1781162646|5.0|Not the typical story you expect to read when you see its authored by Stephen King, but sucks you in just the same.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A book you won't be able to stop reading and one that fills in the gaps that tv is unable to show because of time limits. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Plan to buy more in the future.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I liked the old version.  My kindle updated this app this week and it is a useless weather app.  It now features all kinds of video and flashy ads.  I wanted a weather app to get forecasts not to see videos of aliens in New Mexico.  I have switched.  Good bye!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Wow what a great series! I was one of those skeptical people who dragged their feet to watch. Now I watch and read the books at the same time. Any complaints people have try to remember that a movie can only be so long and a book can go for however long the writers imagination will take them. Lighten up and enjoy some good entertainment!
1905113161|5.0|I love this book!  FABULOUS and well worth the $96 I paid.  I paid more than that over 20 years ago for some college textbooks, so I was very satisfied with what I got for what I paid.  If you are interested in buying it, it really isn't worth the high prices asked for it buy some amazon sellers (unless it is signed by Eddie himself).  This book can be bought brand new for less than $100 USD (shipping included!)if you do enough searching on the net.  Check out Squires Kitchen.  Keep in mind it is a British publication, and it is £35 plus shipping (about £25).  Price in USD will fluctuate depending on the currency exchange.  Your credit card company will take cake of the exchange.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|Kindle fire won't charge. This is a huge problem throughout the owners of what could be a great product. I have usually raved about all my amazon purchases. But this one being one of the MOST EXPENSIVE PIECES OF JUNK I have ever purchased. I have tried countless chargers that work only of a day or two and then stop, leaving me with a nice paper weight of electronic trash. Amazon should recall all of these broken Kindle Fire's and either fix or replace them. Leave the customer with a positive reaction instead of disappointment. Their marketing team should know that word of mouth is the fastest and most reliable way individuals research future purchases. Right now thousands of unhappy (and rightfully so) customers are telling friends and family to steer clear of the Kindle fire because it costs almost as much to buy chargers as it would to buy another brand that actually does what it says. Double tip here: Kindle fire - great concept but only for about a month of service and Charging: once your machine stops charging (and it will) save money on buying chargers and just buy a brand from someone else.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nothing beats good old Solitaire. Fun and easy to play where ever you are. Great game for the whole family.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Wow what a great series! I was one of those skeptical people who dragged their feet to watch. Now I watch and read the books at the same time. Any complaints people have try to remember that a movie can only be so long and a book can go for however long the writers imagination will take them. Lighten up and enjoy some good entertainment!
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is a great way for me to check my e-mail while on the go. Easy to access my account.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Oh myyy! Where to begin.....Oh yeah, This is my favorite SciFi tv show of all time. When I thought nothing could ever top Star Trek The Next Generation. Sorry my fellow Trekies, but my alligance is to Atlantis now. I will forever be a Star Trek fan, but this series is just soooo good. Everything about it is done to perfection. The sounds, story lines, everything! I started to watch the series well after its cancelation. I did not know about it. I was on the fence if I should really watch it. Only because so many other SciFi shows have really been boring for me. Well things changed right after the first episode. Thats all it took. I would highly recommend this series for anyone who enjoys really good action without the Rated R stuff. This show is very family friendly. No sex stuff, nothing that you could not watch with kids around. Its very good like that. I could write forever about how good this series is, I think its time for you to watch it and post a another 5 star review. Enjoy!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game has different settings letting you make it as challenging or easy as you like. Great entertainment for everyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It keeps you involved the whole way through and wanting to see more.  The characters are ones that you make a connection with and that to me is what a series needs. If you don't care about the characters, you are not going to want to see what happens to them. Characters you love and hate of course, that's important, but the humor and the intrigue of the outcome is to me the best part.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the entire series... this TRIED to stick to it pretty much and it was a good rendition.  In my opinion the books are always better than the movies, but then in books you can &#34;see&#34; the characters' thoughts .
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Not sure about this show either cut love the actress. I'll have to go back& re-watch it again to see if I really like it.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I love J. Cole and I love this album. This album is 10 items better than the sideline story and it's worth the 14.99.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The season was awesome despite its horrid ending. Keeps me on my toes though for the next one. I also miss Cybil :(
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Cavill, I mean!  He is terrific as Duke of Suffolk outshining Henry VIII in every way.  It is wonderful storytelling, making terrible history accessible and illuminating.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|It's got the basic game functionality, but if you've played it on an apple device you're going to be sorely disappointed with this version.  There's not much replayability after you beat it once.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It didn't hold my attention like the previous books and just dragged on. Also, I felt that some of it was too monotonous. I was very disappointed with the ending, thought it was just going to be a trilogy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Play this game<br /><br />It is the greatest game ever I love it I think everybody should buy this game seriously
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great movie, full of adventure and suspense. Was interesting to get some history of 007. Never really remembered much from previous movies.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The music was fantastic.  I could envision each scene of the movie in my mind, but was able to focus more on the meaning of the words & the music.  Very talented group of people!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book answered a lot of questions that the previous books in this series had raised. It was a good stand- alone but also it fit well into the previous set of stories.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|This was a good solid Disney movie.  Nice ending to mesh with the other movie. No problem letting the family see it
B007URVZJ6|2.0|The information about formatting is good and easy to follow, but otherwise I am left with a lot of unanswered questions.<br /><br />How do you select a live day? What other steps would you suggest after loading? Marketing helps? How or when should you notify people the book will be live?
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is so funny and wonderful! The book carries more charm of Ellen than her talk show. I love this book.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I would have never guessed that I would like this as much!!  It is amazing!  It's got romance, mystery, smartness, Humor all in one.<br /><br />I just cannot believe that I have been swept off my feet by a serial killer!!!<br /><br />Watch and see for yourself...
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This portable version of Uno is great!  I play it for hours.  I also like the challenging options but the instructions need to be a little clearer.<br />The one minor complaint is selection of a card when you have a large deck-it sometimes picks the card next to the one you want.  I guess I need to avoid the larger decks.  lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I totally loved this game...even got my 11 year old to download after helping me play, although some levels were really challenging. Wish there were more than 10 levels!
B004LQI0HE|4.0|I won't give it away however but did feel unnerved and sickened by it. Several controversial issues were explored which I think made this movie worth watching as well as the acting. We live in a time where science can substantially improve our lives but nothing takes the place of our humanity and nothing gives us the right to take the place of God.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Amazing what a 'big budget' film and talented crew could accomplish in the 1950's.  Other ScFi films of the times are decades behind.  FP has Star Trek phasers and scenes resembling the interior of the Star Wars 'Death Star' . . . amazing.  Not a bad story line either.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A compelling story of the tragic life of a child in foster care and how it impacted her adult life.  A reminder of how one person can change a life with a little love.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this is one of the coolest games i have played.  addictive an awesome I have it on every aneroid device I have owned I can never get enough. not as fun as the first one though I will say, only because u cant b the zombies on this one. but all an all great game keep it up glu games.
0446573027|5.0|Without repeating too much of what the other positive reviewers have written, this story is engaging from the first page, as the character development happens very quickly and smoothly.  John Puller, a retired Army CID is nearly thrown into this mysterious crime in order to investigate and bring the suspect(s) to justice.  Coming from a military family, he is very straight-laced, focused, purposeful, only says what he needs (less is more), and does not like to waste time with fillers and sensationalism.  He meets the local police sargeant, Samantha Cole, and together, they take off into this investigation and lead to places and information that neither could have predicted.<br /><br />I have not yet read the Lee Child \\"Reacher\\" series (just started Killing Floor, because now I'm curious), and therefore my unbiased opinion of this book is that I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in fictional military/government/political crime suspsene thrillers.  Though I have never been to West Virginia, I liked how Baldacci painted a fantastic imagery of not only the physical, but the social and cultural elements of it as well - and never over-doing it to the point of creating boredom or excess and unnecessary verbiage.  Accurate or not, I felt that he conducted a lot of research in order to provide us with vivid intricacies to help support the plot, characters, and reasoning.<br /><br />Your attention will be balanced as you read through this story.  No boring or slow spots.  No outrageous or unbelieveable circumstances.  Clear to follow.  Short chapters, too.<br /><br />I'll be picking up more Baldacci, soon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have this game on my iPod touch and my mom's phone and I have played it for a while and I think this game is one of the besties!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Love this game.  Very addicting.  I can't stop playing.  Sound effects are great too. Watch out for attacks from other sea creatures
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing, I loved it so much. It's so much better than the movie. And I can't wait to read the second book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great game. You cant go wrong its free.The game is fun the first couple times you play it but after a while it becomes a little boring.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Excellent read, now working on getting the rest of the trilogy read. Very well written, would recommend it to anyone!
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|Why is the Blu-ray/DVD release of the \\"Vikings\\" season 1 mini series taking so long to be available?  I missed some early episodes due to fierce competition from other channels at the time it was aired on the History Channel and was dubious about the program when it was first being advertised.  I mistakenly thought it was another \\"Spartacus\\" comic book styled pseudo history that glorifies extreme violence and hyper-sexuality.  That may still be up for discussion, but the visual detail of the programs won me over and I slowly began to enjoy the characterizations and the story line.  While the series does contain a large helping of visual and emotional violence, it is kept in what could be described as a historically accurate context.  I would not go so far as to say it represents a totally accurate representation, as it is a fictional account of a Viking clan's progression.  The acting is very good overall and it took me awhile to recognize Gabriel Byrne as the tribal chieftain, who it the principle foil to the designated hero, Ragnar a farmer/warrior with a lot of ambition, portrayed by Australian actor Travis Fimmel.  I particularly enjoyed the characterizations of Ragnar's family and the women in this series are given better than average screen time and depth.  While Ragnar is no saint, prone to excessive violence and at times malicious cunning, he is clearly a product of his social environment and has a deep love for his family, his people, and his religion in a time of change.  Not unlike our own times in that sense.  But unlike these times, Ragnar uses his abilities to be a ruthless warrior, with little mercy for his opponents/victims.  But the Vikings, historically, were not known for being kind or merciful to their foes and victims of their incursions into the Christendom of the Middle Ages.  In that sense the series triumphs, as we see Ragnar and his crew attack villages and towns along the coasts of modern day Britain and the Benelux/France region.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys historical drama in the days of old.  Hurry up!
0345803485|1.0|It's for Twilighters... I found it too basic.  Even when it is supposed to be sexual, I think it's written at a teenagers level.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the graphics which are good and clear. The game play reminds me of the old \\"Space Station Oblivion\\"  on the old Commodore 64. The background music is OK and mostly unobtrusive.
1612930832|5.0|This book is very useful.  It has exercises to train your mind and make you a new person.  If you use it correctly, your life will be abundant!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Entertaining action film. Characters were likable and funny. Good movie for relaxing and distracting. Looking forward to a sequel soon.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this thing because my dad made everyone get it. me and my sister were sad because we couldn't get it and know we do!!!!!!!!!!  It is a very addicting app!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Another well conceived plot with great character development. Once again John Corey plays a humorist version of the James Bond.
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|I never write reviews but I thought this book deserved one from me. From the moment I opened it I couldn't stop reading. I absolutely love the way Jordan describes things and his warped view. I can't wait to start reading the second book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so much fun. its very fast pase and fun. the choses of costumes and powerups. there is A very wide veradey. I liked the faces the minions made hilarious!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Vonnegut casually writes a story of the life of Billy pilgrim. The main point is the bombing in Dresden during WWII, but it is constantly switching between different points in bullets life. It is not confusing at all and is actually very easy to follow. Overall, this is a great read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the most awesome Trilogy i have ever read. If you haven't read this book then your missing out big time! Read this whole trilogy in just 3 days.....could not put this book down for nothing....talk about having an imagination to an intense love story. Gotta get me a Christian Grey ;)
B003MXAOVM|5.0|Fantastic movie about William Wilberforce and the fight to abolish slavery.  should be required in all classrooms so students will understand how much difference one man can make if he decides to follow God's plan for his life.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the most awesome Trilogy i have ever read. If you have'nt read this book then your missing out big time! Read this whole trilogy in just 3 days.....could not put this book down for nothing....talk about having an imagination to an intense love story. Gotta get me a Christian Grey ;)
0345529057|5.0|I decided to read the Game of Thrones books after finishing season 3 of the series on HBO.  HUGE fan of the show, so far the books are really good and the show seems to have followed the plot pretty closely.  This set is a good value for anyone who doesn't need the collector's set.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this Novel! There are no words to explain and i would most definitely recommend this book to all readers!!!!!!!!!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Cheesy lines (still funny), endless action scenes. Less of a plot then the first one. Chuck Norris comes in. Worth seeing for free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the most awesome Trilogy i have ever read. If you haven't read this book then your missing out big time! Read this whole trilogy in just 3 days.....could not put this book down for nothing....talk about having an imagination to an intense love story. Gotta get me a Christian Grey ;)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh boy!!!! This is just the game I have been waiting for. I just watched Despicable Me 2 and find these minions so adorable. Thank you Amazon for having this available on my Kindle HD. The game is fun. Good for kids and adults alike.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This Novel is off the hook! No way i could put this book down......awesome, awesome, Awesome! You gotta read this book!
B001RJTFP4|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie. Looking forward to seeing the next two Blade movies. If you enjoy vampire movies, watch it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put this book down if my life depended on it....Stayed up to wee hours of the morning! I had to know what was next.....definitely recommend you to read this Novel.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The third season was as funny as the first two seasons. We love all of the charactors. Sheldon never fails to make us laugh.
B007N8RULO|2.0|This game is really too small to be comfortable playing. Okay in a pinch but prefer something that takes up most of the space.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. It is like floors, but you get to use the whole room. Lots of fun. Even my kids love it.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|great movie LOVE the minons would highly recommend to any want a wholesome family movie. I have found I am just a kid at heart when it comes to movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey weaves a saga of souls bound in a confining world as a result of the demented desires of an earlier generation. The strength, creative genius and resilience of one woman begins the first hopeful steps toward freeing an entire enslaved society. The world is clearly built in the reader's mind, with heroic characters arising from unexpected quarters. This is great read!
B005J4TLN4|5.0|So many of my friends and family loved this movie after I had them watch it!  It truly shows what can be done with wonderful actors that are unfamiliar, a low budget imaginatively used, a well written script with a great ear for local dialogue, and the respect for your audience to offer social commentary without cramming it down anybody's throat.  By being it's own delightful self it contrasts dramatically with how bloated, mindless & shallow so many mainstream Hollywood movies have become.
0062255657|2.0|Except for one specific page that was quite adult, which in my opinion was absolutely not necessary at all, this book is a young adult book. I bought the audio version on Audible to keep a very long car ride from becoming dull. After the story was over, I really had to wonder why there are so many glowing reviews. The characterizations, descriptions, and language were all extremely good (perhaps this is where all the hype is from). The author paints excellent pictures. But I was somewhat unimpressed in the development and the lacking back story of the antagonist. I never did really understand the motivation there. It almost seemed as if I'd missed a prequel somewhere or had missed out on a prior book series. I was also exceptionally disappointed in the plot conclusion. It did seem that good triumphed over bad (albeit ambiguously) and there were some interesting concepts on the removal of time and the elimination of the existence of things interspersed, but overall I was uninspired. Had I had another audio book to enjoy on my trip, I would have preferred it instead. I'm (gasp) not a fan of the Potter series or the Twilight series or similar genres; if you are into those, you'll probably think it's okay. For me, it was just \\"meh\\".
B000QELMF2|5.0|I ordered Eyela to be my Queen Tara, from the movie &#34;Epic&#34;. I have recreated a miniature woodland hideaway throughout one of my shade gardens, all based from characters in the movie. The Schleich figures I have ordered to be a part of this world have not disappointed. Being made of plastic they will withstand being in the outdoors!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Spacious. Love that I can fit most of my accessories. Sturdy, good for outdoors. Price is good, and quality comparable to higher priced backpacks.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I found this kindle ebook very suspenseful and entertaining. I have it only 4 stars because I couldn't imagine Kaye thinking about fooling around with someone else. I found this very out of character for her.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a good SLOW game. I am always waiting for goals & sometimes as I am working on goals they disappear.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|this movie is a a must see.  Definitely makes you think about things in life and how this can actually be a reality.  Great movie!
B004QXJZXA|5.0|You are not a true racing fan until you've seen this film.  If you've seen this film before, then the Blu-ray is worth the money.  If you haven't, but have seen a 24 Hours of Le Mans race, then get this Blu-ray NOW!  If you don't know what the 24 Hours of Le Mans is, but consider yourself a race fan, then you still need to get this Blu-ray.  It doesn't matter if you watch F1, Indycar, or NASCAR, you will want to see this film.<br /><br />My only complaint about the Blu-ray transfer is that it is quite obvious that the first reel of the transfer had to be spliced together from several different prints.  That's not uncommon with older films, but once you get past the first reel, the transfer is flawless.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for.  I am a list maker and this app is perfect for keeping all of my lists organized.  At work I have  post-it notes everywhere so I thought this might have the functionality I wanted.  You can make lots of named lists and quickly bring up and edit and sort each list.  Using it on my kindle fire is perfect since I can carry it with me.  Now I put my shopping lists and all of my to-do lists on it and just make sure I bring my kindle with me.  When I think of something for a list I pull out my kindle now instead of my post-its or some random list I made.  I will never spend time searching for &#34;that list I made&#34; again!
B00CLD65X0|1.0|soooo boring, and it distracted my wife way too much. I wanted to watch something good but I couldn't because my wife watched it like a chain smoker smokes cigarettes. so as a straight man I feel it necessary to warn other straight men not to let your wives get started on this crap. However I'll have to admit that it must have been very entertaining for my wife; she would have given it 5 stars. but the account is in my name so I get to review it HAA!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great game for all ages. and it defiantly keeps you occupied for long as you need quiet time.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|Acting is very good, costumes and sets are superb.  I enjoy watching historical reenactments, although I know that the facts are &#34;played with&#34; a bit.  Still, this is enjoyable.
B006P96PAO|5.0|A movie about strong men with strong family values. A wonderful movie to watch with your son or for guys to watch together.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|We have a 10 year old son that we watched this with. All three of us were so bored we turned it off after 45 minutes. Very dark and ugly feel to this movie.
B0010KHOS0|5.0|My son had to twist my arm a little bit for me to watch this movie with him. I am using not attracted to addiction oriented movies.  Turns out this is an exceptional movie, with superb acting, a realistic plot illustrating real life challenges, and a love story about undeniable attraction that eventually triumphs despite conservative societal opinion. Reese Witherspoon was adorable in &#34;Legally Blond&#34;-captivating in this role.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching and memorable. Don't miss an opportunity to see it.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Having friends in the film, now I get to see more of the scenes they were in, I was quite pleased to see all of the extras as well!
B009YG2ND8|1.0|Waste of money! If this is the future of tablet gaming, I'm going back to board games. Meh. Don't buy it!
B0055D3EFU|4.0|great movie great quality. purchased online and launched using Amazon app in my tv. The whole experience was simple and quick.
037571457X|4.0|I was totally surprised by this book. My book group chose it, or I wouldn't have read a graphic novel. It was a very quick read, but very moving, and I have found myself thinking about it several weeks later. I also bought the second in the series, Persepolis 2. I preferred the first one, but I had to find out what happened to her in Europe.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Start with season one and watch every episode of Star Trek on Amazon. Classic is where real television started, the 60's tv shows are still some of the best.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Amazingly done, DC Universe is stepping their game up.  I was never big on Batman but after watching this I'm looking forward to the next release.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I could no open the game in my son kindle tablet. It said an internal error ocurred and that was all.  he can play.
0553582038|4.0|A lot of people dislike this book - but I liked it.  It is different, not as action packed as the others however this is due to the storyline.  Too many people are hooked on instant gratification and 30 second sound bites.  There are huge changes in some characters personality due to their previous experiences - there is also an outside world that is moving their respective chess pieces due to the war and the instability that resulted (new characters and plot lines).<br /><br />The book seems to take its time because things don't happen immediately, no cell phone or airplanes here.  Dragons take time to grow,  it takes time to cross the ocean to fight, or assemble an army, or to rebuild a kingdom.  This book is about moving/pushing pawns (if you are a chess player you understand the analogy) for the end-game.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I would give this game 5 stars because its very fun and also very hard. Its a nice game to play when u have much time on your hands. It also is a way to relax.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Simply entertaining...refreshing and realistic characters and well-written!!!  I was very impressed with the relationships and all of the nuances added. Especially McKenzie...and that swear jar! It captivated me and worth every hour I spent reading it. Would love to read more of Emma Chase!!! :))) I will be watching for new stories!!!
B004R1Q296|5.0|THE BEST BOOK ON MEDIEVAL SOCIETY EVER WRITTEN. EXCELLENTLY DOCUMENTED, AND THE NARRATIVE IS SUPERB. IT MAKES YOU TRAVEL TRHROYGH TIME AS IF YOU WERE THERE, BETTER THAN IN A FICTION BOOK. THE ACHIEVEMENT ON ALL OF MRS. TUCHMAN BOOK'S IS GRANDIOSE, BUT THIS ONE IS HER BEST.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I just started the second book, but it is so good that I have trouble putting it down to do other things.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It takes a certain kind of person to do the things Mr. Kyle<br />Did in the military,  and I commend him for it.<br />May the rest of his life be a healthy one.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|It was awesome! I enjoyed it thoroughly. I would recommend this movie for anybody. The picture quality was amazing and it has a lot of good action scenes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very strategic and awesome. I learned a lot of codes and strengthened my knowledge. My favorite level was level 8, my opinion.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It was good until the update I had to get rid of this game and download it again I lost all my progress I had just started the under water but your stupid game would not update
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I loooooooooooove mythic book very much. It was the relatability of the way it was written. The boy Charlie is so cute and when he was sad I was so into the book that I too became sad. I was glad that he had a not so typical happy ending and finally became content with himself I think we can all learn from the protagonist and his experiences, I believe that the preteen people and people in their mid-teens would take more from this book and understand it better. The title was well thought out and extremely clever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very funny and fun. Like a mix of temple run and subway surfers. Worth the time it takes to download.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|What a fun and challenging game this is. It has a variety of mini games in addition<br />to HO areas. It offers a quickly refillable hint button and a map showing areas of action. But, be forewarned that the free version only permits you to play through approx. 1/4 of the complete game. To finish out, you must purchase it for $5.99; I have read other reviews jn which the player was able to get it at a discount, based on prior purchases. While I gladly paid that sum, I realize that I must be discerning regarding reviewing new games, the better to wisely spend my limited resources.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I downloaded this app for my 6 year old daughter to play with. She has had lots of fun as well as her two older sisters. We even shared it with our neighbor's daughter.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo bitz is just up my alley. I love to play bingo anyway.great game.One of my favorite games to play.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|It doesn't let me literally do anything but stare at it and I can't type I something and have it show up like this app says it can
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Fun game my son even like it .challenging,cool and exciting.It really keeps you on edge trying not to flip over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think just about every little kid will love this game I love it soooo much. It is a lot of fun.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Someone used to tell me is the best lie has some truth to it, which is what makes this book brilliant and fun to read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it love it but they should make a 2 one and I would play that love it but needs more stud kk kk<br /> hfsghfff gzgh
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|it is a very good game and I like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they should make more games get it already!!!!! did you
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the features and the different minions that u can get but I don't like how u have to bye the mom and dad and the nanny with s<br />Token things
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I can use it with or without Wi-Fi. I am a big post it fan and still enjoy writing my notes but this is a great second choice. I like the colors I can change to and go from pad to checklist. Great for kindle fire.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Families tend to revolve around their sickest member, in this case Kevin, a very bright but difficult child from an early age: cynical, cold, uncaring and baffling to his mother who is unable to bond with him or to get her husband (his father) to understand that something is terribly, terribly wrong with Kevin. The book is in the form of letters to the father trying to sort out and explain the mother's frustrations and guilt about Kevin and the effects his behaviors have had on their family. This is a painful book to read so &#34;love it&#34; probably is not the right term for my feelings, but it is very well done and thought-provoking, a book that I probably will never forget.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I tried to watch the preview and it did not come through.  I love the series and would like to see it or at least get a sampling of what was yet to come.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; so perhaps my expectations were too high. Each of the individual sections was excellent, but somehow this book did not seem to come together. I had trouble understanding how some of characters related to others and to the story as a whole. Still, there are some good stories within the book and some interesting insights about ex-patriot Afghan people living in the US and Europe.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining game. Slow to load on my Kindle but very worth the wait. Cool sound track, good graphics and entertaining game play.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is a delight! Tina Fey is brilliantly funny, insightful, warm, candid, and engaging in this romp through her life. Her cultural references are spot on, and often hilarious.  I recommend the book to any woman or modern man who would like to laugh and relate.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Fast moving......lots of action, stunts and improbabilities, which I like. The plot was just the typical evil guy wants to destroy the worlds civilization in order to save mankind.  Cruise did a good job in killing this plot......we are safe again!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Great characters, lovely story, excellent acting.<br />What more do you want?<br />To be the directing debut for Dustin Hoffman, is amazing.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Better than Google Reader. It's able to present news in a much better format. Feedly also organizes the articles better.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Interesting read. Especially so as I had visited Oak Park<br />and seen some of his houses.  Dramatic, intense,<br />informative read.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|At 55 ohms impedance, these headphones do benefit from having an amp---unless you don't mind having to crank up the volume on your laptop (I have used them with two Thinkpads and one Asus).  With my MP3 player ([[ASIN:B005C3GYE6 Cowon C2-16BS 16 GB Video Player, Black with Silver]]) I have to have the volume at 35 or higher (40 is max) though it sounds fine without an amp.  Anyway, I have a [[ASIN:B00A9LHLQ6 FiiO E07K Andes Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier, Black]] on the way, so will update this review when it gets here...am expecting/hoping it will be the icing on the cake.<br /><br />My Grado SR80s at 32 ohms do much better without an amp, but they are physically much less comfortable: the AKGs' earpads sit AROUND my ears rather than on top of them unlike the Grados, so aside from them getting a little warm (I might have to spring for the velour earpads sometime) I can happily wear them for hours and hours without my earlobes getting sore.  Also I can listen to music for hours and hours on them because they are so non-fatiguing: marvelously balanced and even have a slight treble roll-off, which is fine for someone getting on in years like me who's probably already lost a bit of the higher frequency hearing (above 15KHz).  The Grados on the other hand are impressive when you first plug them in because they are rather \\"hot\\"---the highest and lowest frequencies seem to be accentuated, which makes them kind of \\"fun\\" headphones especially if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy and/or high-tempo pop/dance or hard rock type music.<br /><br />The AKGs are particularly exquisite if you are into midrange-dominant music like jazz, classical, or vocal music: instruments and voices come across with remarkable realism in tonality and timbre, and quickly become very addictive.  Whereas on the Grados the midrange seemed rather thin and recessed, and overshadowed by the treble and bass.<br /><br />So really, it all depends on your preferences.  The physical comfort of the AKGs is less subjective, however: they are easily the most comfortable over-the-ear phones I've ever tried.  This is a HUGE factor worth considering.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 stars: 1/2 star deduction for the vinyl-covered earpads heating up my head, but I probably should've ordered the K240 Mk 2 version which come swith the velour earpads instead...kind of wish they had come with more breathable foam earpads like the Grados instead, but I imagine AKG chose not to because these insulate the sound better and form a better seal which allows for more bass.<br /><br />Speaking of which, you'd have to be a total BASS-HEAD to say that these babies don't put out enough bass...I find them to have MORE than adequate bass, and it's nice tight accurate bass not the sloppy boomy kind that teenagers are generally used to and have blaring out of their cheesy car subwoofers.<br /><br />Last point: sound leakage with this \\"semi-open\\" design was far less than anticipated.  You can only hear the music if blasting it; at casual/comfortable listening levels they were fine...I tried it out in a public library.  Certainly far less leakage than the Grados.  Haven't tried them out in a noisy environment yet to see how their sound isolation compares to my in-ear headphones, but that's not a fair fight anyway...I probably wouldn't recommend taking these with you on a flight!is less subjective, however: they are easily the most comfortable over-the-ear phones I've ever tried.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loves Tinker Bell and this story is even more perfect now that we are preparing her to receive her little sister. What I like most about Tinker's stories is that she portraits a feminine character that differently from all the Disney princesses, has a temper, mskes mistakes and learns from those mistakes. And she has enginering skills, uses critical thinking and creativity to solve puzzles. Overall a realistic figure and good role model for little girls.
B00005JM0B|3.0|let me start off by saying this movie was ok but i rank it 4 behind terminator salvation, the special features are ok you arent bombarted with specials, i still dont like that the antagonist was a female nothing against females and she actually did a really good job i just personally would have rather seen a dude but thats neither here or there. overall its still a good movie i would buy it again if this one got damaged or anything. and if youre terminator fan then a definite must.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It is a great tool for any phone. I love being able to preview and purchasr songs at a great price anytime. It is great with Shazam.
0307744434|5.0|This book was so enjoyable.  interesting characters and an even more interesting story.  Can't wait for more from this talented new author.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i love this game and its a combination of temple run, subway surfers, nyan cat, and mega jump but it closes on my kindle
B0035JGYZS|3.0|When I think of ST:TNG, substance & character development are 2 PHRASES that come to mind. They are also 2 phrases that do not apply to this movie. 2 WORDS that do apply; however, are action & adventure, which this movie has, in spades. Which is fine if action & adventure are ALL you're looking for. That's about all you're gonna get with this GIGANTIC step backwards with such a beloved franchise. You will also get, as an unrequested bonus, a lame story about Picard's youth & a Big Bang of an ending that everyone should've seen coming. I'm kind-of upset that I didn't the first time I saw it! Almost Everyone seems super-impressed w/ J.J. Abrams vision of Star Trek. This is essentialy the same thing. It's just missing his name & a few of his bells-and-whistles. What's also missing is storyline continuity. Worf, by this time, is on the Klingon High Council; but, who knows? Maybe he got bored? And as for Wesley Crusher's all-too-brief appearance? He's been traveling with The Traveler & would have no interest in rejoining Starfleet. For any reason. I know that it's a lot of episodes to go through; but, really guys you could've tried just a little harder to get acquainted with the characters you're writing about. It's also a little sad that one of you has been playing one of those characters for fifteen years at the time of this movie's release! Still, it did introduce this filmgoer to Tom Hardy which is not all together a bad thing! And good acting can really save a bad movie. In this case, we have about fifteen really solid, if not really Great Actors! So, I would say watch this one at least once. You might just like it. You might not. It doesn't keep Trek from being great. It just wasn't their best work. It Definitely wasn't their worst. That honor probably goes to Star Trek: Insurrection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun me and my brothers love it we play it all the time it gives a thrilling feeling its awesome
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i loved the game but there are so many glitches that it would not load after i  downloaded it. what i could play of it i liked.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great app for the boring moments and for going to the toilet and have so much fun with this little minion
B007N85ZXY|3.0|I bought this and it's not bad, but I really have to be in the mood to listen to it. I prefer Harvest etc to this album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This wasn't the type of book I normally read, and I loved every bit of it. The hard to talk about subjects and helping Sky finally feel and love were put together perfectly, the beginning had me guessing the whole book as to what it was that set her off. Love the timeline!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|megadeth is really giving the fans new music all the time..unlike  other big name thrash bands... super collider favorite song on new album so far
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|The 5-2 diet is so easy to do and result - weight loss - very little effort to maintain. Yeah.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I know all the critics have already gushed over this album, which initially made me wary of liking it, but I couldn't help but fall in love with it. I feel as if I've known it for years.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I love this game but it's kind of hard to get the cards to move within such a small space.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|BONES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS AND I CAN WATCH RERUNS AS OFTERN AS I WANT.  I LOVE IT.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I completed this within a few days. It is an easy and entertaining read and the plot as such is very intriguing. The science is absolutely flawed. The heroes escape from great peril in the most unlikely way in situations where adversaries get eliminated easily.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I've never seen such a thorough Sudoku game. The variations on the game add interest and keep me playing.  I also like that I can adjust the difficulty level for whatever mood I'm in.  I'm no where near testing if it truly goes on forever, but it has enough to qualify for me.  I didn't give it 5 because I'm finding some of the options confusing.  I've had particular difficulty with the pencil in options where all of a sudden it put them all in and I couldn't find a simple way to take them out, or vice versa. It seems this part of the interface may need some clarification or clean up.  But this is not enough to keep me from playing.
1475143389|5.0|This book breaks the mold on working out. Mike Matthews does not follow the trend that a lot of personal trainers do and all those workout magazines that seem to tell the new secrets on a monthly basis. If you want a nice easy to read and comprehend book that explains everything from basic nutrition, when to eat, how much to eat, and what exercises to do to gain the most, this book is for you. It literally walks you from point A to Z. Plus, if you ever have questions, just e-mail Mike, he really seems to be a really nice guy that actually cares and he will respond to your e-mails. I highly recommend this book. There are very few books on fitness out there that I can honestly say are a joy to read and are an eye opener on working out/health in general.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I enjoy being able to set a mood by adjusting all the variations of sounds.  If either my daughter or I are having trouble sleeping, this app always helps.
1936891026|5.0|If you want to get past your creative blocks, then this book is a must to have . . .and you will win the battle.<br />It is well-written.<br />Learn why you have those blocks by reading this book. Learn how to define who you are and validate yourself. Learn how to reach that higher realm. Learn how to believe in yourself and your work.  Do you know that self-doubt can be an ally?  Do you know that being paralyzed with fear can be a good thing also.  Read about self-doubt and fear in the book and how it helps you to use your creativeness in a positive way.<br />It is a wonder of a book. So glad I bought it.  So glad Steven Pressfield wrote it.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I really appreciate that whenever I have a few minutes I can do a quick routine.  There is such a variety available that I can work as much or as little as I choose.  It is very simple to use so I don't have to spend a lot of time learning, I just click and go. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was since there is no audio clue that an exercise is nearing completion I have to keep my eye on the screen while I'm working out which detracts somewhat.  A simple tone or countdown for the last five seconds would solve this.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|The movie is very stimulating and exciting without much of the &#34;bedroom&#34; scenes, which I can do without all the time.
B008XGW1CI|4.0|Although starting a little slow, I grew to really enjoy this book.  The characters started out all the same, but became distinct characters in themselves.  Makes you really think about the class distinctions in your life.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|while i enjoy the movie, for some reason part of the movie was omitted, i know because i had seen the movie previously, i should have  returned it, but  it wasn't worth the time and trouble, so yes i was disappointed, will buy another copy from some else
1439102732|5.0|LOVE IT! GREAT STORY LINE! I got it on time, and it is such an amazing book! :D Thanks Jodi Picoult!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|It's a great book to understand why some nations try, try and do not achieve a good level of greatness.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Yentl was a fine movie with just enough singing from Babs!  I liked the storyline and it's message about life.
B005DZMNHA|5.0|I think this is Chris's best album.  I Love this man and his music, his voice, his romantic lyrics.  I listen to him all the time.  I am hooked.  I have his movies, all current CDs.  He is mind candy to me.  His music has really helped to de-stress me.  This album however, ROCKS.  It's a good one to take with you on a walk to keep you moving.  I'm only sad that I did not know of him till 2 years ago.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Ok, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed watching Life Of Pi in 3D.  Which is why I bought the book (like so many others?). I had seen the book for sale when it was new, but I was not tempted to buy it.  However, reading it after seeing the movie gave more dimension to the movie, and it amazes that such a simple story is so complex (ok, I guess that's an oxymoron).  Anyway, I loved both.
B005ADOQTI|5.0|I Love the video that comes with this music CD.  I love Chris Rea period.  He is so cool and to see how he makes his music and how he does his shows, it's very satisfying to a fan.  I am never disappointed in anything Chris Rea.
B009VA1FN6|3.0|The mystery unfolded in a surprising way, but failed somehow to be convincing in it's reality. I felt disappointed in the ending - it seemed abrupt, as though it had to be quickly wrapped up.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|I purchased this accidentally, but I though wth, it's a dollar. Anyway, I stopped playing when I came across the picture of the lady cooking wearing what I assume was meant to be black face. Just tasteless.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book even though at times it was predictable. I enjoyed the unfolding of two stories with alternating chapters although the story interrupted this flow occasionally. The characters were realistic and played well with the progression of the story. I enjoyed the development of relationships that the main character goes through and the development of her learning to trust others. I thought this was a good story, an enjoyable book.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|To be completely honest,the first time I heard of a John Green book was when I was on tumblr. I had pretty high expectations for this book. Not only did this book reach my expectations, business actually a better book than I thought it would be. Thanks Mr. Green for an amazing journey. Lindsey would beyond approve your writing.<br />Thanks,<br />Alex
B00821OX98|4.0|I usually don't like stuff with big green monsters. I thought it would be fake looking and unreal. However I am hooked! The story lines are good, the acting is good & it is actually pretty good show to watch!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a AMAZING game it I saw addicting if you have WiFi you can connect and play with friendship should get it 5 STARS!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game wish it was longer.  Will definetely be looking for the next one.  Very easy to follow and challenging
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Like many others on here I had message that my version was out of date. Update went through without a problem, however I can only open one park. Would like to know what Amazon is going to do to fix this problem.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Despicable me is such a great movie, when  I saw this was in the Apple and google play store I couldn't wait for it to come to the amazon market, it's such an addicting game, it's been working fine for me all  week until this morning, all it needs is an update to fix a bug, everyone just keep submitting reviews saying it keeps crashing and I'm sure gameloft will fix it asap
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We really are hooked on this program.  Love the history of how the families lived regardless of their having to &#34;find&#34; money.  Obviously felt they were above actually working and disdained any family member who thought something different.  I am not overly fond of the series three ending which will remain undescribed for those who have not watched it yet.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I absolutely loved it.  Rosamund Lupton outdid herself.  From the minute I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down.
1439153663|5.0|Oh my gosh, you guys, go buy (or borrow...or steal...) this book right now. I'm serious. Don't even read the rest of this - just get yourself this book, find yourself a comfy seat, hunker down for a few hours and get yourself ready for a terrific read.<br /><br />What are you still doing here? Go!!!<br /><br />Ok, I'm done. But as you can tell...this book was SO GOOD!!! It's been a while since I read something that truly grabbed at my emotions as much as this did. I honestly could not put this book down - I loved every bit of it. Every character was strong, regardless of how big or small a role they played, and each character played a very integral part in the story. It was one of those stories in which the bad guys were so vile that you wanted to reach through the pages and slap them, and the heroes (mostly heroines in this case) were the perfect combination of delightful and sorrowful.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I'll save you my ramblings. I will say that one of my absolute favorite touches of the novel was that the main character Lavinia was dubbed \\"Abinia\\" by her new \\"family\\". It was so simple an addition to the book, but it managed to be one of the most powerful parts.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Have had no problems with bugs or glitches. Always feels like I am progressing in some way instead of waiting for days on end to get the money to buy something new or have something I bought actually start being a relevant item. It also rewards you with the currency that you are able to purchase with real money, maybe not as often as I would prefer, but enough to where you are able to get some of the more exclusive items in the game.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Read straight through. A beautiful fairy tale for all ages. Lovely and haunting left me wanting more. 3 more words.
B001EBV0NU|3.0|Not my choice to watch but everyone else wanted to see it. Interesting all the well known stars that had parts.
B0089LOG02|4.0|\\"Orphan Train\\" does a great job of comparing one generation to another.  We all know how  different the generations are, and yet in \\"Orphan Train\\", the author also shows the ways those generations are alike and how they can help one another grow.  My book club is reading this book and I am anxious to hear what they thought.
B009BK67PW|5.0|This show is just so easy to follow and brilliantly written with an even better cast to deliver every character. Love this show & can't wait for more & more!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love this series.  Like a soap opera I was disappointed by the ending of the season's loss of a character I grew to like.<br />But life goes on.  Can't wait to watch next season.
B002361MLA|5.0|took me around 9 months to read it, worth all the while!<br />&#34;don´t fight anything&#34; and &#34;surrendering&#34; are my favorite lessons
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have read many of Neil Gaiman's books and have enjoyed everyone of them. I love the way he incorporates magic, suspense wonder and children in his stories and still makes them appealing to adults. If you have never read one of his stories, now is the time to start!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a fun addicting little game. I absolutely love it! It is a bejeweled style game but with a twist. Instead of linking three or more of the same item, you slide each row and column to create links. Each item gives your little character some sort of buff or attack while he travels through the dungeon. I was addicted to this game for like a week before I finally finished it. I highly recommend giving this one a try.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It's free, and that's a plus. But after level ten, progression slows to a halt. And if you are a cheapskate, there are some things that would take years to obtain without actual money. That sucks.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|This game was fun. I only played it for a few minutes and grew bored quickly. It is a nice game to kill some time with, but I would not invest a whole lot of time with it.
B00AO3K01C|5.0|This was a great surprise. I got it on a whim and was delighted from the start.  Sad, and filled with hope and promises.  I beautiful read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I didn't really understand what Pinterest was when I tried to use the web version, but everything became clear with the app. I absolutely love searching new pins that interest me. The only drawback to the whole system however is if a link from a pin becomes dead (i.e. the location got changed on the linked website or is no longer available). Other than that, I use it everyday.
0547848412|1.0|I detested this book. The first half is pedantic, pseudo-religioso tripe. I assume at some point the journey begins and there is a boat, a tiger, et al, but I sure couldn't make it through the drivel to get to the adventure. I have rarely, rarely, rarely left a book unfinished, much less, half-finished, but this bit of quasi-intellectual mush left me colder than cold.
B008D37J6O|4.0|Unfortunately the Kindle Fire does not support playing wmv. video files. With this app I was able to watch my wmv. videos files with no problems. This is a keeper.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Ridiculously chill and catchy music from the duo of french geniuses. Dont go into this expecting classic daft punk, go into this expecting something awesome in an altogether different way.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best dramas that I've seen.<br />The characters are well play, story lines are always interesting and Julianna Margulies is perfect for her role and nails it!
B0052AC8C6|3.0|i couldn't stay awake through the whole show. cute animation. very dramatic humanizing of animals. would have stayed awake longer if i had watched with someone.
1781162646|2.0|Picked this up to be a nice, scary detective story.  Instead, it's a coming of age tale that (and I'm not kidding here) doesn't have a single scary or horror scene to it.  No horror, nothing scary, not even a little detective story here.  Shame, really.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son loves this game he could play it for hours none stop but it's hard when the runner catches speed but Ira great entertainment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed it immensely. The characters are so complex - you laugh and cry right along with them. I live for remarks from the Dowager (the matriarch of the family). A lot of hurt in season 3 however. Ready for Edith and Mary to get along. And for Edith to be happy. Can't wait for season 4.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|If you like the walking dead tv show, you're going to be shocked of how how much more graphic and better these comics are
B004OR199G|5.0|CSD is written simply and with a healthy spoon of humor.  Kris Carr gets straight to the point and is very understandable. You don't have to be a full on vegetarian to appreciate this book and it's points.  I've started incorporating green smoothies and more vegetables into my diet and I feel like I have more energy and less sugar crashes. If you haven't seen her movie or blog check them out as well.
B002IXA5KW|5.0|I love this movie. I believe it is one of the most underrated movies of all time. The style, the characters, and the plot were fantastic. I have watched this movie multiple times and it hasn't become old as of now. I highly recommend watching this film.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|The book is wonderful.  What a way to spend a couple of long hot summer days with the temperature above 100 degrees.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app could be better, such as lag, graphics, etc. But it's still good. It's something to do when I'm not bored.
B00178JDCK|5.0|This inexpensive pedal kicks ass, provides everything from subtle spring reverb to VAST cathedral-like reverb. The 'Space' setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note, providing a strange harmony. Some people pick on Behreinger because they're stuff is (still) cheap. I admit that two of their pedals (of the 10 that I have bought) underwhelmed me. This one is a keeper!
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|It takes up way more than 1.85GB I'm deleting everything from my kindle and it still say not enough space if you want this game think twice about if this is the only thing you can get on your kindle
B001TOIW5G|5.0|I just wish I could have been in a pub when this band was rockin'! Some of the best proto-punk you'll ever find. Classic!
B0000024YL|5.0|I have these in vinal and don't listen anymore. Now I can listen at home and in the car. I loved them years ago and still like them.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|This product comes as all 4 books clumped into one file. Kind of a minor issue, I know, but I like seeing my %progression through the book, and when all 4 are in the same file, 1% is like 30 pages, so like 60 kindle pages.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|As an old fart who grew up playing actual pinball tables I have been having a wonderful time with this app. It is easy to play and easy to improve your ability. Graphics are impressive and smooth. This one may finally encourage me to spend money on similar apps.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was one if the better Sookie books that came out later in the series.  It seemed to me that Charlaine put her love back into this series for this final book.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Finally someone explains in plain english what happens Inside our bodiies when we eat carbs, and why we should avoid them. I've Lost 40 pounds recently, and the only way I could do it was by using Atkins. But there was always someone to tell me That I would die of a heart attack. No More!, now I no better!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was not as easy as I thought it would be.  Wish there were more levels.  Just  10 levels, didnt take much to finish once I got going.  I could be addicted but there weren't enough levels.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I have played Carcassonne the tile laying game for years and was happy to see the game for the Kindle. It is addicting. The River II add on is part of this game and adds to the fun. My only co
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Did not see the show when it was on TV but wished I di was sorry the season had to end I love every show in all of 5 seasons
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I discovered Rodriguez, as did many others, in the documentary, &#34;Searching for Sugarman.&#34;  Great movie, greater music.  Why he wasn't a big star in the 70s is a mystery to me.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I really enjoyed the character development through the seasons.  I was hooked after watching a only a few episodes in Season 1.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|If you like the Moody Blues you will like this one, since Hayward wrote most of their classic hit music.
B00355L2TU|4.0|This will definitely give you the intense workout you're looking for. I usually put it on silent after a while and put on music instead - Jillian can get a little irritating. The reason I knocked it down a star it because I have knee issues from being a tennis player and this left me with pretty sore knees. You might have to modify the workout to suit you if this is the case.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|I bought McCartney's CD, &#34;Kisses on the Bottom,&#34; which I loved, since I also grew up with those old songs before rock and roll took over my life.  So, naturally, when the Blue Ray came out, I had to have it.  My only complaint with this is &#34;The Inch Worm,&#34; which is on the CD, was not included here.  That was the only song that I had never heard of, besides his new original &#34;My Valentine.&#34;
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Love this movie!!!  Although, it was a little scary for my 3 1/2 year old the first time we watched it.
B00847KFDS|4.0|A good album, but if you were there when the originals came out, you know what an impact they had then.  This is a good album, but not that original in its sound.  Brad Paisley's guitar was a treat.  Liked the two new songs.
0345803493|5.0|I loved that the book actually had a plot and sub-plots. The sex scenes may bother some readers but I enjoy Sylvia Days book. She writes through all times
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This documentary tells the story of Rodriguez, who made two rock albums in the U.S. in 1970 and '71.  They went nowhere here, but in South Africa became a bootleg sensation.  The quest to find where he is now, or even if he was alive, is told here. Fascinating story, and really great music.  How we missed this great artist then is a mystery to me.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|You should get this app because awesomeness to the driving and it is a little hard but the most important thing is doing the tricks sumtimes I do that at school !!! THATS COOL
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I won't be like many and rave that this is another classic from Dylan.  It is very good, but that is all.  Not classic.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|A nice game.  Many variations and easy on the eyes.  I have trouble with the colors of some blocks (snakes), but that may be particular to me.  Otherwise, I enjoy the game a lot.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I discovered Rodriguez, as did many others, earlier this year in the documentary, &#34;Searching For Sugarman.&#34;  The movie was great, the music better.  This is one artist who somehow wasn't a star in the 70s.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this game.  It is easy to see the blocks, and the game is easy on the eyes.  Many variations/patterns keep the game interesting and challenging.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The pebble in the ocean being the Afghan war, this story and many like it have rippled out and formed the experience of the Afghan diaspora. It may be a novel, but there is painful truth here...
B008I43DYU|5.0|I was looking for a good calculator when I came upon this one.  I use it a lot and find it very easy to use and very handy.  It suits my purpose for simple calculations, but it really can do many computations.  It should fit the needs of anyone needing a calculator.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love period pieces and the English do it the best. There is enough romance, villans and innocents to make watching and re-watching this series rewarding. I have just finished watching Season 3 and am devastated. I feel as if I am cut off from &#34;the family&#34; when they may need me the most.Casting has been spot on. The locations and costuming breathtaking -- I wouln't be surprised if some of the fashions reappear in current times. I can't wait for Season 4 and beyond.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|itss fun trying to figure out what you need to find.  i really enjoy this game. fun for a puzzler.
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|I had such High hopes for this release, Upon hearing Bound for glory.. That song is Great, and really Pegged the Thin Lizzy Feel. Everything else on the disk is a flat line, with only a few shinning moments. Had I the choice again, and Now I can actually hear ALL the songs before I were to buy, I'd ONLY bought the FEW songs worth while, and NOT.. have wasted the 15.00 on the deluxe version release. Try before you buy.. I am a LONG TIME LIZZY FAN.. I know.. THIS IS NOT THIN LIZZY, BUT... the way the band is marketing and Promoting it, as a strong similar vein, I will concede, there cant help but be some parallels, due to Scott's influence,BUT.. Its just NOT a strong release..<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />It's been a few months since i purchased this disk, and have listened to it many times.. I want to like it. But.. It just isnt that good..Some disks I purchase.. are surprisingly good, and I can't seem to STOP listening to them.. but this one is NOT one of those.SOme of the songs have grown on me.. and If you think of the release in those terms. You will be happy with your purchase. It is a GOOD CD.. But nothing stellar.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I love it, the results I get are unbelievable.  I highly recommend it to other artists, and anyone else who loves to draw.
0740748475|5.0|There have been a lot of truly great comic strips over the years. But Calvin and Hobbes stands out as one the immortal classics of our time. I remember reading these strips when they first appeared in the local paper many years ago. I have even bought a few of the trades when they first came out as well, so I have read many of the strips once maybe even twice before. But as soon as I saw this handsome edition, I knew I had to have it! It was exactly how I wanted to treasure these wonderful koans of my childhood.<br /><br />But then I read some reviews that gave me pause. There were some complaints about poor quality. So I waited. Then a couple of years ago I couldn't wait any longer and I decided to gift this to myself for Father's Day. It was a great gift! I savor them, I read them in small batches at a time and I treat the books like the priceless treasures they're meant to be. In that regard I can say, they are superbly made but then I don't abuse them; I treat them with utmost care. They are truly a joy and a pleasure and I fully intend to savor every moment in my slow crawl through these pages. And, they are even more of a delight now than when I first read them because now I am a dad and I'm finding whole new ways to relate!<br /><br />Much thanks to Bill Watterson for crafting one of the true immortal works of the 20th century; these strips will forever have a special place in my heart. I feel that with this work, Mr Watterson captures something quite marvelous, in perhaps a Jungian kind of way but I think also in ways that have yet to have someone's name associated with them. And of course, it is also hysterically funny...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game hour and hour of fun for me and the kids.  Wish more items came faster but all in a great game.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|I was swept away from my mundane existence to beautiful Tuscany and a warm summer's night - such wonderful music
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I love anything  to do with the minions and when I saw this app it was a great app and wanted to try. I played  I  do  long periods of time then one day I started the app but it would not start it kicked me off. I restarts  the device an  it still did not work. I was very angry and sad because  I liked it. It is a great game do  most devices however the kindle fire hd is not one of them.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Of course nearly everyone over the age of 35 or 40 has seen this true American classic. It tells the tale of a small American town when everyone knew everyone else - when you didn't have to lock and bolt your doors. When having a alarm system wasn't in 3/4 of every new home built. And you could ride your bike everywhere without fear of being ran over.<br /><br />I grew up in such a town. I didn't realize it until much later but my grandfather and 2 of his brothers owned about 50% of the town that I grew up in central Indiana. My grandfather, for example, owned 14 houses, the post office building, his auto repair place and a small strip mall. It seemed that at least 1/2 of the town was related to me in some matter.<br /><br />But enough of that - this movie will stir feelings in anyone who grew up in a small town environment. It is very well done and has a good acting job by Ron Howard, who even sings, well, more like lisps, 'Gary, Indiana'. And, of course, who hasn't heard 'the song, '76 Trombones'. I only wish one of our Librarians looked like Shirley Jones. This is a great story that quite simply could NOT get funding to be made today - nothing is blown up and no one get killed. The ending is great even through it's a very predictable Hollywood ending.<br /><br />I get a kick that ANYONE could believe they can be taught to simply THINK about playing a musical instrument and be able to do so.<br /><br />It's interesting that this movie beat 'West Side Story' for the Tony in 1962.<br /><br />BTW - one of my relatives, Forrest Tucker, had played the lead role on the stage and, according to my mom, lobbied hard to get the movie role. But It's hard to imagine anyone other than Robert Preston playing Professor Harold Hill.<br /><br />This picture is top notch as is the overall acting and direction. The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!<br /><br />I would rate this a 9.25 to 9.75 out of 10.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game...finding the clues is challenging, but not so much that the player becomes frustrated...looking forward to the next level.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It'd the most important thing to be able the team Utrecht to be able to be to be aGreat app
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game but in the harder levels you get frustrated but come back and pass the level and its so much fun to see how far you can get
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The story is wonderful, Bradley Cooper should have won Best Actor- he just captures the character so well. It has become one of my all time favorites.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was really good and I can't wait to read the next book. I would definitely repaid it again. Please read this book
0385523912|5.0|I can't stop telling people about this book. I knew North Korea was problematic but this is far more insightful than the news
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I'm addicted to this game and got my sister addicted as well. It's fantastic! I'm constantly playing or updating my park. Who hasn't wanted to own as dinosaur or underwater extinct critter? Plus, the new glacier region is mighty cool, too.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Great cast . It delivers. Good John Wayne vehicle.Lots of colorful, memorable supporting characters. Successful remake or recycling of Rio Bravo.
B004KKX80A|5.0|This is the second Cosmic (Big Bang) Pegasus F:D I have bought. Once from a different seller. The first ones metal core and PC frame were loose, the metal was dull, as was the energy ring. IDK why, but this Pegasus shines brilliant, stays together steady and smooth, and the Right Rubber Flat is breaking in excellent. I have done business with this company and have had all rave reviews. If you want a quality product, I would have to say this is the seller to buy from, hands down!
B001EC0OMM|5.0|You can tell this was made from a good play. Top notch cast and performances by all. Stewart definitely deserved an Oscar.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|just downloaded it and i already love it because i like simple things and this was really easy to use  i like it i hope you do too
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|this app is so cool and scary! have to deal with so many zombies and trying to survive! hope I can go farther and survive longer! the app is also scary, yet satisfying! I enjoy this app because it's so challenging! give this app five star! keep up the good work!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Very boring app!  Don't waste your time getting this app because its not worth it.  There has to be better apps out there than this!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|What a disappointment ...this version 2.0? is filled with extras not needed for what this app was intended. Graphics. and background scences distracting. Bring back the original! I want to know my local weather, not watch videos. Who's idea was this? Gotta delete.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fantastically, awesome app!  A must have for every Pinterest lover!  Well worth the time it takes to download!  Get it immediately!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I have been listening to Donald Fagan and Steely Dan since the 70's and he still sounds great, never disapointed.
B009ZM74F8|1.0|This is a weak entry into the genre. It mostly copies some aspects of other, more successful movies: black vinyl trench coats - check; Big Brother screens playing in the background - check; etc etc. The premise is completely ridiculous: feeling is outlawed and controlled with a drug (aah, sure). If buy that, then the next problem is that the supposedly feeling-free enforces are constantly displaying feelings of anger, glee and whatnot. I don't even want to get deeper into this, because there is basically no logic or even an attempt at explaining any of it.<br />The events also don't make much sense and really there is not much to recommend about this movie. The \\"fighting\\" scenes are over the top nonsense that is a complete waste of screen time. Skip it.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|Chilled out and relaxed, upbeat tempo. I love Sara Bareillas and I only just discovered her through Pandora. Album is great and so is she!
B00457X7XQ|2.0|I had a lot of respect for Mark R's technical skills, and expected to learn more about cyber crime from his novel.  Actually, the technical content was pretty good, except I can't recommend it because of the unnecessary sex scenes.
0307165485|5.0|I have given this to most of my son's 4-6 yr old friends over the past year and EVERYBODY loves it.  I remember reading it well past age 6 but English is my second language so older English-speaking children may find it babyish.  The combination of stories, rhymes, vocabulary and pictures is fantastic.
1781162646|5.0|I couldn't put this book down !  Another great story by the great author Stephen King !  I would LOVE to meet this man.
1426308469|3.0|I bought this as a gift for a 4 year old. Probably better for age 6 or 7.  There is too much info on the pages and it gets confusing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I am a fan. Have been since Good Omens. Yet I continue to be stunned by Neil Gaiman's imagination and narrative magic. Was actually sad when it was over.<br />Oh well, on to Neverwhere and Make Good Art.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the books these two authors write together, especially the books with Special Agent Pendergast in them. They always keep his character constant, he doesn't change from book to book, and I love that. I fear that this may be the last Pendergast book, but I truly hope not.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If I could, I'd rate this one off the charts!  I was hooked from season one.  And have never been disappointed.  The characters are interesting.  The storyline is captivating and never boring.  However, I do recommend that you watch all three seasons consecutively to enmesh yourself into the trials and tribulations of Downton Abbey.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I never thought this book would ever come out and I loved it I couldnt put it down. Just like the last 2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is awesome!  I especially like the video, it is hilarious!!  I saw the movies and I loved them but this is my first time playing the app.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It's  a very good book. Asf and the series of v for the higher education and the series but it
B0091REZMW|1.0|It's not that I hate it it just would not download. If it had loaded I'm pretty sure I would have loved it.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Fun for all in the family, this movie presents children with the alternative to traditional love coming solely from their biological family. It opens up the possibility that sometimes, life susrprises you with a source of love, understanding and happinness that was not available within your blood relations. This movie is full of magic and excitement... Great to watch with the kids!
B004S7VQT0|5.0|Hamid's novel is in many respects reminiscent of [[ASIN:0679723161 Lolita, 50th Anniversary Edition]] - the narrator is engaged in a conversation with the reader over a meal in Lahore.  As the story progresses, the narrator, Changez, details his life in America in which he lives the \\"American Dream\\" - admittance to Princeton, landing a very well-paying job with a prestigous and selective finance firm in which he is successful.  He falls in love with an American girl , Erica, from the Upper East side - life couldn't be better.  And then there were the September 11th attacks, which change not only New York and America, but also Changez's relationships - with Erica, with his firm, with the United States.<br /><br />As Changez describes it, the change is gradual - as Hamid writes it, \\"I had always thought of America as a nation that looked forward; for the first time I was struck by its determination to look *back*.  Living in New York was suddenly like living in a film about the Second World War; I, a foreigner, found myself staring out at a set that ought to be viewed not in Technicolor but in grainy black and white.\\"  It was not only the United States that changed, but Changez himself.  The consequences of the changes are tragic for all characters concerned, the similarities to Lolita continue, as one begins to wonder how reliable a narrator Changez is, and what precisely the nature of the American with whom Changez is speaking becomes more sinister.<br /><br />It is a marvelous story, and it is brilliantly written.  Hamid provides perspective on America before and after September 11 through the eyes of a Pakistani, as well as a sense of who Pakistanis are in the midst of larger geo-political events.  Thought-provoking with an open-ended conclusion, it is easily the best book I've read this year.  Highest recommendations.
B000065V42|4.0|If you are a fan of science fiction and family movies, this is it.  Great acting, always entertaining and addecuate for all ages. It is a plus is you are a fan of miniaturization.....
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The movie starts out really slow, and doesn't pick up until well into the second hour.  In the end it frustrates you to find out that three hours does not complete this movie, and now you'll have to wait for the next installment.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is an intensely emotional story of an extended family, wiith all the drama, history and heartbreak that accompanies living in the present day.  If you want to feel Kabul during the Soviet occupation and later, if you want to enjoy knowing this one Afghan family and what happens to each member, if you want to see Afghanistan from the viewpoint of a foreign volunteer who comes to help the Afghan people, this is your book.  If you love a good read and like to shed a few tears, this is your book.  If you enjoy current history, this is your book.  It has it all.  Enjoy it.
B000021YQV|2.0|but the case was cracked and broken. The CD works great though. I definitely would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the case.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love the music and story line.  It was a good message about finding your way along with staying true to your dream.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|kept the story  line moving and held my interest.<br />Kept my attention so much i ordered several more of his books.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I loved this second CD even better than the first one - and I thought that one was pretty great! They do a rendition of &#34;Nearer MY God to Thee&#34; that is almost haunting.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Is there a better movie to define Christmas? Maybe but this one is my favorite. Must watch every season for good tidings!
B008XX6J4C|4.0|These folks are so creative. They bring a modern touch to classical music that gets you addicted in a hurry.
B001NP8PQW|3.0|I thought It was going to include all the hits. I´ll continue buying this kind of concerts. they are great.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like Google for searches and this doesn't disapoint. Had Bing as default on my kindle but found the program invasive with pop ups that wanted to get my opinion blocking my searches til i answered the surveys.
B00846REIS|5.0|Immediately hooked! I could not put this book down! Can't wait to find out what is next for Eva & Gideon!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Well scripted, fast moving, and intense.  Love it.  Wish it was in widescreen format though.  Kind of wierd watching it on a widescreen in that format.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I absolutely love how Dan Brown writes.  You can help but become immersed in the story.  I felt every emotion of every character and could not put the book down.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|So where do I find the rest of the stories!  The story line is great, I really enjoyed reading this one.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|This book had really intense characters, a great plot and kept you wondering right until the end.  I would recommend this book.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This book is great! It's so interesting to follow this main character's thinking and changes throughout the book. This book is thought provoking and I would read it again.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Well shot. Good acting. Funto watch.  Although not particularly inspireing like Forever Young was for me.  Manybpeople would find itmboring.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Did not disappoint.  Normal Grisham standard - aims to engross without taxing the brain too much.  Good holiday read.  I found it very amusing, much more amusing than his novels normally are.  Enjoyed it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was a replacement as my original cord would no longer plug in. No questions asked, I received another one a day later at no charge and I love the customer service I have received from Amazon.
B007HJ96NO|1.0|The original is an all time favorite. Try to find the well edited original and avoid the elongated directors cut at all costs. So sad to mess with the academy award winning original.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This game is great is fun to play when your bored and it works out your brain. Sometimes it's difficult but you figure it out later but don't get to angry
B003ASLJRW|5.0|I have been watching the actor eastwood from the days of rawride.<br />Pale Rider is one of his best efforts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Start of this book pulls you right in, I could not put this book down. The story and how these characters meet and the path this story takes is different from most books I have read, I genuinely loved it and would 100% say this is a must read for anyone.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|its great on my kindle fire. I can look through videos just like on my computer and share them with friends on line.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love the work week and weekend features!  I also like the alarm starting out softer and slowly getting louder to pull me out of my nap!
B0012YYZYK|4.0|Needed it on Blue-ray and the quality is fine. I'm glad some of these older gigs are now in higher quality.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Well written.<br />For all law lovers.<br />As good as the innocent man<br />David here makes lawyers look very good.<br />Slow to warm but gets fast early.
B00AJLHUWQ|3.0|This is Riversides 5 LP. I heard a quote stat said, &#34;most modern bands are only good for their first three albums. It seems to be the case with Shrines of New Generation Slaves. It's not a bad album but it can't even be compared it to their first three albums. The keyboards feel every Emerson, Lake and Palmer and the ambient and samples are very Pink Floyd like. I like to own the actual CD's from my favorite artists but I wish I had just downloaded the MP3's. I will still listen to this new material but it doesn't catch me emotionally. This still sounds better than most ProgRock/Metal bands in the U.S.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app alot you can really see whats going on very simply  Thanks for making it easy to use  5 stars from me
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Lots of good memories for a fair price. Look for lots of the Beatles music on Amazon.com. I'll be back for more.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|They updated the app and made it more like a cartoon for kids with points you can earn.  it is not a game I just want the weather!  I am removing this app and finding a real weather app.

B008RA3X5E|2.0|It's ok. But I wouldn't pay for this app. A little complicated.  Nice clock faces nice graphics but not worth paying for.
B0087XBUS8|5.0|THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD I ALMOST DIED. NOW BUT REALLY ITS REALLY FREAKING GOOD. SO BUY IT AND READ IT.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is a bargain and a life-saver for gamers like myself.<br /><br />One of the unfortunate problems with older gaming systems like the Nintendo Gamecube is that once newer systems come out and manufacturing slows and stops, the prices skyrocket.  So when my Gamecube controller was destroyed in a flood, I was pretty much out of luck.  Used video-game controllers are very hit and miss (I've bought several that just flat-out didn't work), and new controllers for the Gamecube cost anywhere from $60-$200 here in the US because they aren't manufactured anymore. (That's the price for official controllers, I don't mess with crummy third-party controllers)  I was genuinely sad, because some of my favorite games of all time were released on the very underrated Gamecube, and I was doomed to be unable to play them anymore.<br /><br />Thankfully, I stumbled onto this and ordered one, and it was a tremendous find and a great purchase, mainly because it is very affordable, only costing about $40 or so with shipping, saving the buyer a significant amount of money.<br /><br />Even though it's imported from Japan, this official Gamecube controller will work on American Gamecube and Wii systems, so don't worry.  It features a very nice white colorscheme that matches the Wii, and has a 10' cord (a few feet longer than the controller's regular cord) which allows the player to sit back a bit more even though they are still corded to the system.<br /><br />The controller feels good in the hands and is very sturdy.  The only slight complaint I have is that the shoulder buttons feel a bit \\"hollow\\" and light, but it's nothing to worry about, it's a very minor complaint.<br /><br />Honestly, if you need a new Gamecube controller, this is the way to go.  Don't waste money on the pathetically expensive controllers here in the US...  buy one of these, it's the same thing and costs a lot less.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I've read all of Joe Abercrombie's works and I have to say this one is my favorite. Epic Fantasy meets Wild West.

B001B83M9Q|5.0|This one is different from their others. Most of their early material is just as good, but these tracks appeal to me because of the wild attitude in the photos, guitars and vocals. Their other albums have a variety of songs and are more staged while Jack simply rips it up on this CD. One of my favorites.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|My antivirus program, Avast, has a feature where it detects Virus like behavior from a program.  I have used it for years on my pc and over a year on my android device and this is the first time it has been set off.  I think Baloons Tower of defence 5 is a great game but I'm concerned about it getting flagged.  It means some thing like statistics collection is questionable.  I suspect the company is reputable enough but they should take the timem to work with the anti virus companies to insure they are not getting flagged. This is something they should fix if they want to be trusted.

0425263924|3.0|I thought this would give us the ending to our long journey but no, we're left hanging. Considering how long we were left hanging last time I'm thinking by late fall 2014 we might see a forth book to this trilogy. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't a trilogy 3? What's it called when there's a 4th book? Milking the reading public. Wonder why so many people are getting away from books?<br /><br />I had to budget my already to the penny budget just to buy this series.<br /><br />The story, characters and the mystery kept me coming back as well as the romance. Sex too. Nuff said.<br /><br />Needless to say I'll be using my imagination to finish this book.
B00455IVHU|5.0|It is a Good movie  to see and watch over again with two people who know and like in the movies they cute together they  oldtime who recall in thier like Lurean Bacall is and the other is who play bond in golden Eye!

B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This movie was very slow to develop, not very funny, fairly boring. It ended good, but that's all I can say for it.
0062255657|5.0|Extended review on Mina's Bookshelf<br />It's official. I have developed a 'literary crush' on Neil Gaiman. He had me at Coraline. After reading The Ocean At The End Of The Lane, I am spellbound for eternity. He is a wizard storyteller and, like in The Pied Piper Of Hamelin, I follow at his heels to the sound of his voice, mesmerized by the lyrical quality of his effortless prose, entranced by the intimate perspective and mournful tones of a bookish and nameless seven-year-old narrator.<br /><br />In occasion of a funeral service, a middle-aged man returns to his childhood hometown in Sussex. Nothing in the English countryside looks like he remembered - his old house long gone. But as he drives down the narrow lane that connects his childhood home to a farmhouse at the end of the road, faded memories come back to him: an unlikely family of three kind women (the eleven-year-old Lettie, her mother Ginnie, and her grandmother Old Mrs. Hempstock) living on that farm, the duck pond his 'strange' friend Lettie claimed was an ocean that stretched from forever to forever and yet small enough to fit in a bucket, and the bizarre and incomprehensible events that unfolded forty years earlier on the edge of that land \\"where the barriers between life and death were thin\\".<br /><br />Part dark fairy tale, part myth, Gaiman's narrative texture appeals to our primal self, our unstructured and buried 'child soul'. His highly imaginative tale is a powerful and moving metaphor of the distance existing between two different dimensions, two separate worlds: childhood and adulthood. Self-absorbed and distracted, grown-ups are deaf to their children's fears and insecurities, oblivious to the undeniable fact that while outside they are big, powerful and thoughtless, \\"inside they are really children wrapped in adult bodies, like children's books hidden in the middle of dull, long adult books, the kind with no pictures or conversations.\\" As in Coraline, Gaiman's popular fantasy novella published in 2002 and adapted into a stop-motion picture (Focus Features 2009), in The Ocean At The End Of The Lane adults seem to be, once again, unhelpful and clueless, blind to the hidden and true essence of reality, completely unable to empathize with their kids' uneasiness and struggles. \\"Adults follow paths. Children explores\\", our nameless young narrator (Gaiman's alter-ego or Everyman of a morality play, intentionally devoid, by the author, of any mark of individuality) acutely observes. While choosing to never step off the beaten path, grown-ups miss all the patterns, the gates, and the backways hiding beyond the real. To a child's heart, instead, with its refined sensitivity and innate curiosity, this big and complicated world becomes simple and easy to grasp,  enjoyable in its small joys even when greater things crumble down.<br />Of those 'greater things', hidden and sinister truths, our protagonist will become fully aware under the wise guidance and selfless protection of the Hampstock women, wonderful and timeless creatures, Maiden, Mother, and Crone (triple deity common to several pagan traditions), archetype of maternal warmth and symbol of an ancient matriarchal society.<br />My verdict: brilliant and enchanting. An absolute gem. 5 stars plus the moon and the ocean.hed in 2002 and adapted into a stop-motion picture (Focus Features 2009), in The Ocean At The End Of The Lane adults seem to be, once again, unhelpful and clueless, blind to the hidden and true essence of reality, completely unable to empathize with their kids' uneasiness and struggles. \\"Adults follow paths.

B00D37UP4S|4.0|Wonderful movie... Although deviation from the book was present, the movie did a fine job at picking the correct stuff to cut. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Riverside has been my favorite band since I discovered them about 8 years ago. Every release had been great and this is no exception.<br />  It's hard to pick favorites but Depths of Self Delusion, We Got Used to US, and Feel Like Falling stand out for me. Mariusz's voice is my favorite of contemporary prog rock and they're all solid instrumentalists but I'm most impressed with Michał's Hammond organ on this album. He plays like a demon straight out of the 1970s, especially on Celebrity Touch.<br />  I can't recommend this, or any of their work, enough.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|More in the line of beach reading but overall a good read.  The jumps from time to time make it a bit difficult to follow, and the need to  reprise the previous edition takes up more space than is truly needed.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be any good, but it actually was quite good, held my attention all the way through, and if you knew me, I don't make it through about 90% of movies, as they just are to boring, but the characters in this are interesting, the premise is interesting, and that's all I need, but almost all movies are predictable in every regard these days.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like hidden object/puzzle games you'll love this one. Pretty challenging at the end and can't wait for new levels.
B001EBV0IA|4.0|You can't go wrong, fills humanities need to see violence, and also for that violence to be met with violence with a facade of righteousness wrapping it, to make us feel better about our blood lust.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Summary, the series had me gripped until this point. He has a gift for narration, description, and plotting (at least at the micro level), as well as has crafted a comprehensive and complex world to set his epic series.<br /><br />However, not going to spoil anything but, essentially, this is the book in the series where it becomes clear that Martin doesn't like (or doesn't know how) to bring a story together. Instead, his story lines keep forking like the branches of a tree as opposed to an arc that brings to a satisfying conclusion. Branches can only get pruned, they don't ever join back to the trunk.<br /><br />The other frustrating aspect of this book is that it is only half the story in that he follows only some of the characters in this book and saves the other characters stories in the same time window for the next book, &#34;Dance with Dragons.&#34; This experiment of his, I believe, is a failed one. The fate of some of some characters that aren't followed in this book are disclosed so portions of the fifth book are spoiled. Furthermore, the fate of characters you are invested in that aren't discussed in the 5th book makes it for a weird and frustrating read.<br /><br />Though I'm half way through the next one at this point, the whole series has started to sour for me, becoming more of a running soap opera. I realize at this point what motivated me through the first four books was desire to see how the overall story would resolve. After finishing this one and starting the next, I realize that it isn't going to resolve so just reading about random twists and turns isn't enough for me. I don't have the need to read it like I once had.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. it is incredibly well made and the actors are extremely talented. The raw talent in this film alone would have made it good, but the writing was masterfully done and the result was an incredible movie. I heavily recommend this movie.

B0090P98Z4|4.0|I think that it is a good game but it is to easy to get some the weapons and to level up
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hats off to Zimmer on this score...  From 10 sets of drummers in the caliber of Jason Bonham, Vinnie Colaiuta and the like, to broad sonic spectrum of sound...  The melodic and rhythmic structure of the score is perfect! While watching the movie (seen it three times) the score truly is part of the visual and audible performance...  Listening to the score separately one can see why...  It really does tell the store...  Well done!
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|I liked this movie.  I thought it was a very original, clever plot and story line.  Of course it's full of holes, but most movies like this are; its entertaining nonetheless.
B006215P8I|5.0|Lost continues to be the best television series to date...  Nothing prior or since has yet equaled it on many levels...
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I was skeptical about this product and the safety of having a program that could &#34;reach&#34; into my main computer to send the information to me remotely. I started using it with the thought I would get rid of it after a couple of failed attempts. I was wrong! It's a great tool and seemingly safe! Pretty easy to set up and use as well. I don't need it all the time but when I do it comes in extremely ndy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Title says it all. This book was  wonderfully crafted from the first sentence of page 1. Must read! For anyone.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|I can't wait for the next Jack Reacher book to be published, it's already on my wish list. Lee Child is an incredible writer and he knows how to keep me captivated.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun! It's a subway surfers/temple run type game, but the developers really made it their own. It's unique and challenging, and funny if you're a fan of the movies. A lot of movie based games are just spewed out for cheap promotion, but this game has obviously been developed with care and its for free. thanks for the good game!
B007H9B8FS|4.0|for an album so much maligned, it ratings make it look like a successful CD.....1 one star; 6 two stars; and split the difference on 3 stars -5 stars and you get a whopping 12 negative vs. 134 positive reviews.....hmmmm
B002ONV5E6|5.0|Another Bourne Movie which won't let you down in action! I could watch it over and over again and not be disappointed!
B002UTKSBK|5.0|This is one of the best films I have seen. All of the LOTR movies are so well made and have beautiful effects. It's hard to find a film these days that are clean enough to let children watch, but J.R.R. Tolkien would have been proud of Peter Jackson's take on his books. I never get tired of watching these! If you've never given them a shot, I suggest you find a slow weekend or make it a family affair with snacks, pizza, etc as all 3 are long. You will have the best time together!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Quirky, fantastical, mystical.......very good read.  Didn't want the book to end....Made you want to know more.  Such a creative imagination.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game was fun at first but after a while it gets boring.but overall it is okay.I would not buy it if I had to
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have read this book twice and both times it was one I could not put down. I can't wait for the third book.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|I can't go along with so many of the good reviews that this movie has received. For me it was pointless exploitation of the audience. I didn't feel it was well acted, DeNiro's part was so blase it nearly put me to sleep. The plot deteriorated to the point that I nearly left. I wondered to myself why I wasted the time and money to see this film, especially when there are many better choices to pick from. To each his own.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Very disappointed in this app.  Freezes up my kindle fire and enjoyed removing it from my device more than i did playing it!!  Don't waste your time on this one
B000003JBJ|5.0|Well, lets talk about the service was wonderful I did not have not one inch of trouble in this area.Amazon was there in making sure that this was the right cd I ordered. Every time I what a certain kind of music I want Amazon always there to make sure the music I want I get. Amazon & the merchants together makes magic in bring the best music or goods possible. I been with Amazon for a long time and will not go with any other supplier than Amazon. Thanks for everything. CMPack
B001BANK32|5.0|A classic by the horror master. Love re-reading this. So much more... More creepy, more story, more...<br />Cannot wait for the next book to see how he's grown up.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I love Daft Punk and although it took a few passes before the album grew on me I love it.  It has a very 70's/80's vibe and though its different its still true to their roots.
B008602KQI|5.0|I Love the Hunger Games. Such an interesting story and they made the movie as close to the book as I think they could.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Works very well! It's comfortable and responsive. Changing settings is a breeze. Every bottom is easy to reach. Just the right amount of buttons for me. For the price and the quality, if you are on the fence, I highly recommend this mouse!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very fun reminds of old game SIM city gains money and points even while not playing great game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game, not to difficult, keeps you interested and entertained.  Highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to while away their time.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|my daughter saw the movie which is awesome and i wanted the music..we both can listen to it and enjoy together
B000001E3V|4.0|I'm generally not a huge fan of live music, but I think this was worth it.  I love Clapton, who doesn't? But not as good as the studio version of the same songs.  If I was going to pick one disc to listen to, it would definitely be Layla, but the is still pretty good.
B00000JXVK|5.0|This movie is just amazing!  If you ever ridden a motorcycle or ever wanted to ride.. Then this movie is a must see!  I watch this movie a couple times a year.  I love everything about it!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Tried it for  the  first time on vacation to the northwest in our hotel seems to work great will keep using it on this trip
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|I was rally looking forward to seeing this movie.. Only to be completely let down!  It was super slow and anti-climactic!  This movie had so much potential and fails!  I have no idea why every 14 year old girl loves it.  The fight scenes are nonexistent.  Seriously, I thought this movie was a total let down!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|hi this game is not good<br />it froze up on me and takes forever to load<br />I don't reccommend this app
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This new version of Upstairs Downstairs was not as good as the original series from the 70's. It's also not as enjoyable as Downtown Abbey. I liked it, but if something better is available to watch, this will sit in the queue until there's nothing else.
B00CKQ1092|4.0|I really enjoy listening to this album. It is such a great eclectic group of songs in one album. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes harder rock.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very emotional film. Loved it! Great to watch with the family but it will move you to tears. Highly recommend it.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|This a great dress watch, and definitely feels like a quality time-piece. The dial is nice and large, and the white dial is tastefully and elegantly done. Usually white dials are difficult to pull-off and end up looking tacky and cheap. But this watch does it with a lot of class. Of course, it's not a Rolex or a Breitling, but it looks, feels and performs (so far) like a very high-quality dress watch!<br /><br />That being said, the last watch I bought from Invicta (Amazon) came defective. Invicta never replied to my emails, but Amazon offered to issue a replacement, which I will rate and review once I get it. I don't know if that purchase was an isolated incident, or if Invicta's quality control is always hit-n-miss, but their customer service always leaves a lot to be desired. Even when they do provide service you will have to pay for the shipping both ways. Amazon, on the other hand, was rather prompt with their response. Also, like I said, the second watch has performed flawlessly up until now!
B007X4ECMI|3.0|This is a mostly failed attempt to make a good action film in space and barely a couple of weeks after watching it I already forgot most of the \\"plot\\" - still, it has some elements that make it possible to watch. Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Year of Grace 2079. A CIA agent called Snow (Guy Pearce) is arrested for... well, something, it doesn't really matter. For reasons unknown, it is the Secret Service director Scott Langral (Peter Stormare) who is in charge of Snow's arrest, interrogation, torture and future incarceration in (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now).<br /><br />But lucky for him, in the same time Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), daughter of President of United States, arrives at (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now), for some kind of bull%£$t mission necessary to explain her presence there. Just a little moment after she arrives psychiatrically challenged quasi-neanderthalian inmates break out and seize control of the (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now), as easily as if they were stealing lollipops from kindergarten children!<br /><br />Immediately after Snow receives an offer from Langral (gosh, it seems that Secret Service director is the REAL guy in charge of USA) - he will inflitrate (deep breath here!) absolutely most maximal maximum ultra-modern high-security top-level sophisticated super space super-penitentiary MS One (you can expire now), save the girl (to hell with other hostages...) and bring her back to safety. In exchange he will receive full amnesty... And then the film continues, mostly along the lines of \\"Escape from New York\\"...<br /><br />This is not a good film and you can fast forward some fragments - and you interrupt the watching and returns it, you will not lose much... For a moment I pondered the possibility to give it two stars, but then I found some elements which allowed me to give a third one:<br /><br />- Maggie Grace, a very pleasant vision (but regretfully always with her clothes on...)<br /><br />- Peter Stormare and especially his character, ultimately less stereotyped and stupid than suggested at the beginning of the film<br /><br />- some good lines, mostly during the exchanges between Snow and Emilie<br /><br />- couple of good jokes<br /><br />- Snow's first name<br /><br />- one action twist, somehow less predictable than the rest of the film<br /><br />- a message of hope for guys all around the world: you can verbally abuse a girl, hit her in the face, shove her around, brutally cut her hair, cover her head in dirty smelling grease and even throw her in the void from great heights - and she still will want to have sex with you. There is just a catch - you must look like Guy Pearce...<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a barely average film, borrowing enormously from better movies, with a ridiculous scenario (and especially a completely laughable space battle) and an extremely predictable ending - but nevertheless still in the limits of watchable. My advice, RENT instead of buying, as it is really a thing to see once.<br /><br />Fully functional brain is not necessary to watch it. Also, the intake of a minimum of three good beers just before or in the early watching stages certainly will help enjoying \\"Lock out\\".br /><br />This is not a good film and you can fast forward some fragments - and you interrupt the watching and returns it, you will not lose much... For a moment I pondered the possibility to give it two stars, but then I found some elements which allowed me to give a third one:<br /><br />- Maggie Grace, a very pleasant vision (but regretfully always with her clothes on...)<br /><br />- Peter Stormare and especially his character, ultimately less stereotyped and stupid than suggested at the beginning of the film<br /><br />- some good lines, mostly during the exchanges between Snow and Emilie<br /><br />- couple of good jokes<br /><br />- Snow's first name<br /><br />- one action twist, somehow less predictable than the rest of the film<br /><br />- a message of hope for guys all around the world: you can verbally abuse a girl, hit her in the face, shove her around, brutally cut her hair, cover her head in dirty smelling grease and even throw her in the void from great heights - and she still will want to have sex with you. There is just a catch - you must look like Guy Pearce...<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a barely average film, borrowing enormously from better movies, with a ridiculous scenario (and especially a completely laughable space battle) and an extremely predictable ending - but nevertheless still in the limits of watchable.

B005544TRQ|5.0|I never really liked shows about lawyers but this one is the best thing on TV!  I can't recommend enough.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|Joe, I have always been in love with your music since BlackStreet days. You never disappoint me with your music. Keep on doing what you're doing.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I loved this movie, after renting it twice from Redbox I had to own it.<br />It's a great story with incredible actors, Bradley Cooper is great in his role but it is Jennifer Lawrence who steals the show, her academy award for this was well deserved.<br />Beautiful, well written, inspirational story. I would recommend it to everyone.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is not quite Pixar quality of story, but the girls are cute and the minions are funny.  I liked it.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I'd say, the first two episodes were good, or interesting, then there was a drop for 2-3 shows where they struggled with identity (Did they want to be Dr. Who(ish) or not?) Then, everything settled down and the show took a wonderful turn for the better and established a reasonably unique identity they can be proud of that is more Alfred Hitchcock meets The Twilight Zone in nature than the comic strip sci-fi of Dr. Who.<br /><br />By the 9th show of the season Torchwood took off on a sprint.  They tossed off any likeness to US produced shows like &#34;Fringe&#34; or &#34;The X-Files&#34; and embraced the odd, sci-fi human drama that I remember from the black and white TV days of the Twilight Zone where Burgess Merideth played the last man on earth, finally having all the time in the world to read any book he wanted...before he broke his glasses and could not read with out them. I'd say that they were more like Alfred Hitchcock Presents except with a returning cast, setting and characters.<br /><br />I would not say that these shows are &#34;like&#34; the twilight zone&#34; only that, in the same way that the &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; could air an episode one week that is more Action Adventure and Science Fantasy (as John Wyndham of Triffods Fame might call it), the next week the show would be a dark, quirky human story about how &#34;one should be careful about what one wishes for.&#34;  This isn't slip shod and peace meal either, as one might think from what I've said so far.  Like most modern suspence/thriller/sci-fi shows, there is a multi-layered plot at work keeping the entire plot organized and effecitve and various sub-plots to work out that keep things interesting that last for 2-3 episodes before working themselves out in an entertaining and interesting way.<br /><br />This is GOOD STUFF.<br /><br />And when it gets to episodes 8, 9 and 10, make sure you bring a box of tissues.  If this show had been in the US, it would have been a challenger for Best Full Length Show at the Academy Awards.gth Show at the Academy Awards.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love playing cooking dash deluxe. It's a great way to pass time, and my 4 year old daughter loves playing it, too. I find myself going back and replaying the levels that I didn't get three stars on :)
B000LXH0AE|4.0|SPOILER (and forgive this somewhat convoluted analysis, but try and stay with me...): Loved this near perfect and wonderfully executed script, a very lovely crafted conclusion that perfectly illustrates all of the tale's concepts... the original, underlying book being written would have been a masterpiece of literature<br />if he died, totally flipping the overlying story, making it both a tragedy (the tragedy is the author's masterpiece of literature suffered) and (moreover) a beautiful tale of redemption and a brilliant look at<br />mortality, illustrating BOTH the main character's self-awareness, humanity and<br />coesistent free will and fate (\\"I had no choice,\\" he states when Maggie Gyllenhaal's character asks him what happened in the hospital, which to Maggie merely illustrates his humanity but to the viewer represents both the fatalism of his awareness that he did not control his fate and of course Hoffman's earlier comment \\"you don't control your fate\\" but Hoffman's later comment \\"live your life\\" and Harold Crick's choice to do so, representing the marriage of his fate and free-will, that which is a universal truth we all live in)<br />and perhaps more importantly the altogether different self-awareness, humanity and<br />coesistent free will and fate of the author who is unable to bring herself to write her masterpiece as originally intended, valuing reality over fiction and life over art/literature - as she says, \\"that's the<br />kind of person you want to keep alive, isn't it?\\" this is what makes the entire<br />blanketed story so beautiful - thus stranger than fiction, thus complementing the predictable<br />but beautiful twist,  Added to the fact that it was the (profoundly chosen) shard of glass from his<br />watch that saved him (the watch, that which was a multilayered, poignant metaphor throughout the film for the<br />way in which we value and perceive and thus live our lives, the relativity of time as it relates to mortality, our over-awareness of the passage of time which ironically is what often obstructs our happiness, further relating to coesistent free-will and fate)... mortality being the<br />biggest theme in literature, of which the film is simultaneously a wonderful study of in itself.the passage of time which ironically is what often obstructs our happiness, further relating to coesistent free-will and fate)... mortality being the<br />biggest theme in literature, of which the film is simultaneously a wonderful study of in itself.
6305428050|5.0|This movie is a great family movie. Very cute. Elizabeth Shue is excellent as a frazzled babysitter who is trying to help out a friend but winds up getting mixed up in an adventure. I definitely recommend for those with children. I think kids will enjoy this movie. Adults will also enjoy it. It is a lovely change from today's violence and sex.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|This is an amazing concert, musically and video.  The video quality is HD which is so clear.  The first band to show their concert in a theatre in 3D.  It's amazing for video artists to watch and learn from.  I highlly recommend this to everyone that appreciates great music and video.

B006LSZECO|4.0|book concept is intriguing.  Author surprised me more than once with the twists and turns of the storyline. Well written characters. Made me wonder what will happen to the characters.
B001AG52AG|5.0|I first saw this movie on television and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD because I wanted my children to see it. I found it to be an exciting movie with a great story line that my whole family could enjoy. I really hope there's a sequel as the ending suggests.  Two thumbs up!

B001EC3JME|5.0|This holster is universal enough to work with several of my flashlights. The clip attaches to my belt very well and the rotating clip is very handy as well. I give it 5 stars simply because it does what it says it is suppose to do!

With many side effects fasting is the answer to many of the problems created from our current lifestyles. That's if you can handle the worst side effect -that of weight loss!
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Every now and then, I get the urge to watch a simple, uncomplicated story-line movie,and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" fits the bill. I have watched it, or listened to it, several times, as I sew or draw, or work in my little home-office. Although the subject matter is very painful at times, to watch or to listen to,(I get angry all over again; as I did the first time I watched the movie, especially listening to the court proceedings), I tend to get a strange sense of understanding, as I watch the story play out. The father figure, Gregory Peck, teaches his children, in very well chosen, thought out, loving words about the ugliness, as well as the beauty that this world can bring.  The first time I watched the movie, and found out the fate of the victim on trial, I was horrified, but being the type of person that tends to want to \\"see things through\\" I continued to watch it, and I'm glad I did. The characters are real, the children so innocent. It is just too bad that ,still, in this day and time, our children's innocence can be changed, in a heart beat, by cruel, insensitive people, and or situations. However, in the end, there is so much that we can learn from this movie, regarding our behavior and or our feelings, towards people in our lives, who are \\"different\\", than we are. Whether the difference be race, color, gender, poverty, wealth, religious choice, being over weight, being under weight, being \\"just too sensitive\\" (in our opinions) to situations, or most especially,our tendencies of \\"indifference, intolerance, and or inconsideration\\", regarding the mentally or physically challenged people of this world, we \\"will\\" be made to stand accountable for our choices, after it is all said and done. This movie teaches us that we are all in this game of life together, and that we should learn to \\"play fair\\", respect and appreciate each other, for our diversities.  At the end of the day, that's all that counts.  To me, life would be so boring if everyone thought, looked, acted or even felt, \\"just as I do\\" about things. Sometimes I just get tired of myself. Please remember that this world does not revolve around \\"us\\" as individuals.  Sorry,(not really)to get preachy, but this movie gives us lots of food for thought. \\"God bless us, one and all\\"(thanks Tiny Tim).ed or even felt, \\"just as I do\\" about things.

1416549447|3.0|I haven't read this book yet so I can't say anything regarding content.<br /><br />When I received it, the book was bound upside down and backwards.  It's not too big of a deal, because it is still the same book.  I'll just have to remember to turn the book upside down and that the back cover is the front cover.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This movie had a good plot and started out pretty good, but in typical Hollywood fashion, they prolong fight scenes to extremes that make no sense.  Could have been pretty good but I get tired of the absurdity.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a great game!  It's small enough that you can take it almost anywhere! Another good thing about it is that it is easy to teach others how to play!
B008HK3XOU|1.0|I was very disappointed to get my case and find that it does not fit.  It says for Kindle HD 7 inch but is obviously not or someone was not very careful in picking out my case.  Sending it back.

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I was looking at pintrest, &  saw some clever uses of wine bottles...the ones with the bottoms removed and used for hurricanes over candles esp. caught my interest. I called the local glass cutting shop, and was told to remove the bottom of a wine bottle would cost from $25 to $40 dollars. The price was outrageous to me. So I got on line started doing some reseach. There are many methods out there, some kind of crazy and the results were disappointing ....leaving jagged, uneven edges and such. Then I watched the video for the glass cutter, hot and cold water method. It looked so simple and almost too good to be true, but I decided to order the Generation Green bottle cutter....and it works great. Just as easy as the man said, and I have no regrets about getting it, and am telling all my friends how cool and easy it is. Thanks for a better easier way to cut glass bottles. PS. The blue bottomless wine bottles looked great on my 4th of July, red, white and blue table.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I will deeply miss my favorite character in books as well as the amazing man who crafted him.  I did not know Vince but feel like I do through his writing. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. Maybe he can come back as a real Mitch rapp.  God knows we need one!
