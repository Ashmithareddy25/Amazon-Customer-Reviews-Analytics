B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|It takes forever to download and takes up  ton of space which ruined my kindle, now it says i have no more storage but i have erased everything on it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very addictive, and has great graphics. It lasts a long time, so you don't beat it in 2 days and get bored. You can connect through Facebook, and it doesn't have annoying pop up adds.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I like using logic to solve problems.  This one uses a lot of logical thinking.  I also like the graphics.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It requires quick work.  I don't like to spend a lot of time on this one since the higher levels have more difficult solutions.
B009CCBCU4|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this because it stated that there was research done on the culture of the Aztecs.  I didn't get it.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|I was looking forward to downloading pine forest sounds. The site won't load. Please help fix this for me. twenty.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Much to the dismay of some who loved &#34;Catching Fire&#34; I find this first film in the trilogy that will be made into four films to be superior.  Although I don't think, as some do, that Katniss Everdeen is a kick-butt heroine, Jennifer Lawrence is an actress worthy to follow.  The best actors don't have to say a word to get a point across sometimes, and at her relatively young age, I think Lawrence is close to mastering that technique.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are great but my favourite is the gorgeous pictures.  Day response time.  I like the fact that I can only see the complete puzzle three times.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book tugged at my heart and my brain...Though I am far from being a teen, I wish I had been a teen reading this book, and I understand why there is such a following. John Green is a god of empathy; I felt like I was living and breathing this beautiful story, and the range of emotions I felt was startling. Only conflict now is whether I want to see the movie or not...
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Why? Jessica Lange. She is at her best. The other actors are well chosen and the plotlines were very good.
0385523394|2.0|Boring! Needs editing! Everyone in our book group agreed. Really didn't care at all about the author and her experiences. She seemed to have little remorse for her bad choices that brought her to prison, and the writing was listless.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|It was great to see the first season. After viewing the second one, I went back and watched the first one over again. Clever.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Brian Head is back. This is the first Korn album since Take a Look in the Mirror that Brian Head has been back on guitar. It's noticeable. The guitars are heavy, but could be heavier. If you're looking for that classic Korn sound, you will not find it here. You will find a good sound though. No song stands out as that one killer song. The low point of the album, however, is Never Never. The song is just too &#34;poppy&#34;. I was hoping for Korn IV, but with the way they named the album...you could tell it wasn't going to be that classic Korn type of album. The album is good. The vocals are great. There are some good guitar parts. It's just an okay album, but still worth owning. I give it a 3.5.....out of 5. Not a 3, since it gives an effort. But...not a 4 because there aren't any stand out songs, not as much of a guitar crazy album, and a little too mellow and serious. The DVD included is great and worth the extra money.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|David Garrett's violin is so sweet.  It is a real pleasure to listen to his music.  I don't really care for the last piece, but the rest is great.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga is back, and she's back with even better music. This album is noticeably better than Born This Way and goes back to a more modern version of the old school Gaga sound. Pretty much every song is good. The beats are good and you can really get into them. Any Gaga fan is going to love this CD. I recommend you buy the deluxe version because the iTunes event was actually a pretty good performance. Jewels N' Drugs is a surprisingly great song that you will want to listen to many times. The album moves from space psychedelic to just plain crazy, and it's refreshing. And, if you buy the album right away..you might get a holographic cd cover. That's only the first 600,000 prints though.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|A James Bond story true to the classical style of Ian Fleming's character.  It is safe to say Daniel Craig has now truly walked a mile in the shoes of Sean Connery.  His Bond cleverly shys away from cliche' while standing straight and proud in the tradition of the Bonds of Dr. No, Goldfinger and others.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|I did not care much for this book.  Jumping into bed with a perfect stranger is a bit over the top and does not reflect, I hope, how decent girls act.  The story line was very improbable and I didn't like it that a small child was abused.  I know it happens but I don't need to read about it.  Glad I did not have to pay anything for this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book makes you realise how short and important life is. It is beautifully written and I definitely suggest it to anyone.
0762449306|5.0|I'm a lifelong fan of Doctor Who and wanted a small Tardis to sit on my desk at home, (I'm an ex-pat Brit who has watched the show since Tom Baker's 4th Doctor was just starting to save the universe.) At just 3&#34; tall - to the top of the light, this Tardis is great. I was surprised by the level of detail for such a small model, and the fact it lights up is a nice touch too. At under ten bucks I'm very glad I bought this.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is an easy enjoyable game. I'ts bright and colorful. It is also soothing. There is nothing complicated about this game.It is just lots of fun.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|would not work on my Kindle.  Very disappointed.  A first in downloading games for my Kindle. Tried numerous times and it seemed to be frozen.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read.  Fun, entertaining, and written from a very unique perspective.  The take on the Red Shirts meme, and the twists along the way.<br /><br />It is not often I think &#34;wow, thats awesome&#34; when I read a novel, but that happened several times while reading this.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The game was fun overall, but it made my kindle fire crash constantly. If you can overlook the fact it crashes a bunch, it is definitely worth checking out.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|This trilogy was quite sultry with an intriguing plot.  I can't wait for the fourth novel, I'm sure, it'll be just as sultry!
B00EZ50R04|5.0|This is a great movie. Way scarier than the first one and the first one was pretty scary<br />The most terrifying film I ever saw.if your a fan of the conjuring or insidious 1 than you will obsolutely love this movie
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This story was too good to put down even to watch Thanksgiving football!  Grisham gives believable human warmth to his characters while holding our interest to see what unexpected event is around the next page.  He goes through the mechanics of a trial and as a reader, you will relate to someone's response whether it is a juror, witness or spectator.  I hope we see more of Jake and his efforts to be a &#34;good lawyer&#34; really helping people.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Showing an ad at the start of every hand is horrible and annoying. Visually it looked amateurish and outdated. I deleted it after finding 247 Solitaire app.
B00CN3R2DK|5.0|I loved it! She is a  gorgeous doll perfect to my collection...A must have for any Barbie collector. Looks exactly like Audrey!
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I like twitter in general, but the original ap is so limited compared to its competitors (hootsuite, etc). The app itself works fine I just wish it had more features. Its my only option with windows phone, so....
B001VNB54A|5.0|If you are a history buff, particularly in this area... For this price you really need to buy it! If I was to sit down and watch it from end to end it would be DAYS before I could finish it! (Not to mention my wifey would leave me)
B007N8RULO|2.0|Ad placement were annoying, didnt like the layout. I Downloaded 247 solitare instead and deleted this app within five minutes.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Only keyboard I will ever use for Android. So much more efficient and better laid out than so many others. Looks much cleaner and works so much better! Will never go with the stock keyboard again!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I REALLY wanted to love this book, and halfway through, I wrote to a friend and told him he must get a copy and read it. Then, as the story went along I became more and more disenchanted with the main character, and less and less tolerant of  his self-destructive behavior and his annoying self-pity. On the other hand, Boris was an absolute revelation: spontaneous, gregarious, forgiving, generous...simply a wonderful characterization, even though he had enormous faults which brought troubles to so many people.<br /><br />Here is for me the key to the novel: in answer to the cliched advice,  \\"Be yourself. Follow your heart.\\" the author simply says the following: \\"What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that cannot be trusted?\\" That is the essence of Theo, and he has to live for many years and over 700 pages to figure it out...and we, the readers, have to endure his unappealing character for that long too.<br /><br />Having said all that, I must state that I cannot recall a book with such vibrant descriptive language, such poetic phrases, such wildly unpredictable situations and characters. I read all the time, and this novel kept me awake many, many nights. I just wish that I liked Theo more, and if I had I would have enjoyed the book more.
B00DMEQP46|4.0|Very good, consistent album by MGMT. Nice full sound on a good stereo. This release should make the Flaming Lips jealous they didn't get to it first. Highlights for me include: Cool Song #2, Mystery Disease, Astro-Mancy
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|For an artist, its terribly difficult to top a previous genius album. Brilliant albums are wonderful, but there is always the looming thought of &#34;how do you top that?&#34; Some can, some can't. Lady Gaga thankfully falls into the former, proving so in her third full album &#34;Artpop.&#34; Even more difficult than topping her previous album is living up to the hype of this album, which she also does. Throughout fourteen tracks, Gaga delivers some of the most genius lyrics and spectacular sounds in the music industry today.<br />The opener, &#34;Aura,&#34; perfectly sets the tones for the album, exploring all the themes of sex, attention, and empowerment throughout three and a half minutes. All the tracks are absolutely wonderful, but some standouts include &#34;Aura,&#34; &#34;MANiCURE,&#34; &#34;Dope,&#34; and &#34;Donatella.&#34; When really listened to, &#34;Donatella&#34; is a brilliant, sardonic, and witty song, similar to the majority of the songs in the album. It's fantastic to know that an artist like Lady Gaga remains as dynamic and talented as she was when she first burst out onto the scene.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It works ok, and it was a free download, but it's so basic, I wonder why it didn't come preloaded.
B00F2HW220|5.0|Whoever criticizes anything about this album is crazy.  This is another Masterpiece. Ayreon has once again pulled in a cast of vocalists and musicians that are amazing. I would give this 100 stars if Amazon allowed it.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nice game,but too much time to build,but i love the game,hoping the time would be shorten when building and some buildings are to expnsive.....
B00782O7IY|5.0|Wow!  A black & white silent film being made in the 21st century, and it's really, really good!  If you've seen the Oscars, you know it's won several prizes.  Jean Dujardin mostly plays comedy roles in French movies now, one of which was OSS 177: Cairo Nest of Spies directed by the same director as The Artist and with the same main actress whose first name I forget but whose last name is Bujo.  She and the director are married.  As the movie is silent, it doesn't matter that Dujardin's English is atrocious.
B00BC254I8|1.0|Pissed to have to review a book I have not been allowed to read even though I purchased it!!!  Crap
B0037QGS0A|4.0|This is an American remake of a French film, Natalie.  In both, a jealous wife hires a prostitute to test the fidelity of her husband.  Here, Juliane Moore plays the wife and Amanda Seyfried plays the prostitute.  Both of them get naked together, and Amanda gets naked with other people too.  (In the original, Fanny Ardent as the wife didn't get naked but Emmanuelle Béart did.)  I liked the French version better even though Seyfriend hasn't had surgery and Béart has, because I like the way the original French version ended better.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app! It helped me so much! thank you deoidveda! It works wonderfully on my kindle fire. I would recommend it to anyone who loves notebooks as much as me!
B00007L4OM|3.0|This is an action flick starring Jean Reno as a hardassed cop in Paris.  His boss wants him to take time off, but Reno doesn't want to take it.  A call from Japan sends him to Tokyo for the reading of the will of the only woman Reno's ever really loved.  It turns out that they had a daughter who is almost of age.  Reno has to protect his daughter for a few days until she comes of age from the yakuza (Japanese mafia).  The mother was working for Japanese security and had infiltrated the yakuza.  The story was interesting with lots of action.  I enjoyed the scene where Reno went to a gaming parlor with his daughter, but he can't dance or do most of the games his daughter's friends like.  Just before he's invited to play a shoot-em-up game, the yakuza arrive, and Reno shoots them all.  He apologizes to the friends for having to run out and not play the game.  All those guns in Japan is not quite believable. Oh!  Wasabi is the name of a very hot condiment that Reno likes.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I enjoyed the game a lot. From start to finish. No freezing, no glitches or bad graphics. Nice for all ages. It seems Fire Maple Games has found the recipe for my kind of games. Its not their first game I have played. Their games have good graphics and are quiet engaging. However I could have liked to see all those magical people that I save appear in town. Going about their business. I will be buying all their games in the for see able future
B009NF54ZE|2.0|Gave it 2 stars for the graphics.  Tired of seeing &#34;loading . . . &#34; all the time between just about everything.  Also get so far and if you can't get past an area no way that I can find of skipping and going on.  Also don't like how when you finish an area up pops a box so you can tweet, face or whatever that info to others...for me that's a &#34;who cares&#34; type of thing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this app. The rooms were challenging but not frustrating. I look forward to more rooms in the future.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I have to hurry and give copies of this book to my friends before they get their own and I miss the opportunity to be the one to introduce them to it. Because then they'll give a copy to me and I'll be like, \\"No - I discovered her first!\\"
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|I cannot agree more with the 5-star reviewers here. I have just started to collect seasonal music. After a typical search for \\"autumn\\", I came across several very pleasant instrumental CDs that I play regularly. I have close to 20 that range from piano to vocal jazz to orchestral (all with a autumn-leaf cover setting). Then, somehow, I stumbled across this elegant CD by Einaudi who I had never heard of. I have a small collection of typical Italian CDs but nothing in this genre.<br /><br />After listening to some samples and reading the mostly positive and in-depth reviews, I decided to give it a shot. (OK... the design on the cover was also calling to jump into my \\"autumn\\" pile).  As soon as it arrived and I played it once, I was totally amazed! The collection is just stunning and relaxing - perfect for those times when you need to decompress from a tough day at the office (or, maybe an argument with a girlfriend).This is perfect background accompaniment for wistful thinking over a cigar and bourbon, reading your favorite book, or heck, just lounging around the house doing nothing...<br /><br />I will check out some of his other CDs and appreciate all the up-front, positive, reviews that helped me purchase this gem to add to my collection!<br /><br />BTW, for a laugh, check out this review by James Manheim at AllMusic:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />There's no truth to the rumor that he was \\"in a time lapse\\" when he wrote it!!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I am so excited for this game to finally be on kindle! I love the swipe based combat system. I think I might even like this more than the consle version.
B00E9A656K|2.0|Pros<br />+Menu music<br />+Sounds/audio of the cars<br />+... That`s just about it for the good, besides that it`s free.<br />+It had pretty, nice graphics.<br />Just because it`s free, it doesn't mean it's good.<br /><br />Cons<br />+I got really, REALLY frustrated after tier 4, because I had no money by having  the Nissan Altima. And because of this, I had to keep upgrading the stupid thing because of harder rivals.<br />+I ended up having to BUY a Viper with my MONEY, and that cost me seven dollars.<br />+I don't want to leave out the fact that the gameplay itself was HORRID.<br />+Every time I tried to do a perfect shift, the game would lag, but not lag. I mean LAG.<br />+This one game takes up 1.53 GigaBytes on a kindle? Don't you have anything better to download than this?<br /><br />I am great at these kind of games, and you heard this from me.&quot;This isn't a time waster; a money waster.
B00F2362IE|3.0|Booyakasha! Great game....but having issues with constant &quot;not responding&quot; my daughter loves Mikey and was over the moon about this game. Over frustrating that it isn't working as expected.  Have tried reinstalled to no avail.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn made well written and thought out spy novels.  This story show a transition in Mitch's life and could have been the beginning of a new role for Mitch in counter-terrorism.
B00FY2N81W|5.0|Absolutely love the series, This movie is action packed and full of crazy stunts I wish I could try! It is a MUST HAVE!
0143038419|5.0|Very well written.  Loved the travel experiences.  The areas of life explored were thought provoking and enlightening.  Will read more of Ms. Gilbert's writings.
B009F1DIOK|5.0|The middle movie to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, you cannot go wrong with getting the Extended Edition! ENJOY!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|An exciting ride through the dark side of computer power. Gives you a window view into the hacker's world and leaves the reader with a real fear that our increasingly wired world is a very vulnerable one.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is fun and great for Bronte and kids, but there are plenty of complaints I have:<br />1. DOESN'T LOAD<br />For many times, my little pony, friendship is magic, has  not  loaded, and sometimes crashes my kindle fire HD. I couldn't finish a temporary sale because of it &gt;:(<br />2. Outrageous costs for gems and stuff<br />It drives me mad how much money u need to complete the game. For one of the main characters, u need more than 10,000 shards or hearts for ONE MAIN CHARACTER. I wouldn't share this game with a kid or someone who will pay for anything.<br />Hopefully, u understand, and think twice before u enjoy it. Other than that, great game!!!!!!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I had a lot of fun for hours great app. Very entertaining. Great for all ages and helps with eye and hand coordination ..just get it and endless fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive game. Frustrating at times. Played the same levels many times over trying to perfect. Hate it, yet love it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Good relaxing puzzle game.  The sounds are very satisfying and the puzzles increase in challenge over time.  It works well for relaxing at the end of the night and letting the mind go for the evening.
B005HED11Y|5.0|A great old series..  Something different to watch. It is fun to watch the interaction of Kirk, Spock and McCoy in the series.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Horrible Bosses is a funny movie and Jason Bateman is the best!  I wish he could make more movies because they are entertaining and usually clean and funny.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I could not put this book down. I have not cared for his books the last few years but this book he is back
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|No support for anything useful. I bought this thinking it would be superior to a Roku. I should have purchased the damn Roku.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual, John Grisham writes another really good read. This is one book I will want to read more than once
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great read. Well written. Not the hunger games. But not far from it.<br /><br />Thought books got worse as they went.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So full of love, and bravely. I could not put this book down! You will cry and you will laugh but most of all you will enjoy.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|The most hilarious Christmas movie ever.  Wonderful that National Lampoon brought all it's comic brilliance to bear on the subject of Christmas.  God bless the Griswalds every one!
B008602KQI|4.0|I always feel the movies aren't as good as the book but it was still a great movie. Kept me interested the whole time.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It was fun<br />WWE game should be . Made that good would be kilo loves games too me is my friend but he says bad words,
B0090SI582|3.0|I really wanted to love this film, but I couldn't. With that said, I liked it quite a bit, and it's a vast improvement over X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The first two thirds of the movie were very good and grounded the movie in a more dark and realistic world, a nice departure from previous forays into the X-Men universe. The last act was kind of curve ball that embraced more generic superhero movies and was what really hurt the film. The director and star, Mangold and Jackman, cite Claremont and Miller's Japanese sage as inspiration for the film and it definitely is, but if they stuck closer to it and avoided over the top villains and comic book cliches, they could have made a real special movie. Instead, they've created a solid action movie that will satisfy most fans, but not knock their socks off. There's talk of a sequel being made, and I hope Mangold and Jackman have learned from The Wolverine and will be able to make an even more entertaining and satisfying film the next time.
B00C0233A0|5.0|This is awesome! It didn't come with the ultraviolet, but I wasn't planning on using that anyway. 3D is great!
B008JFUP0I|4.0|It's hard to believe how entertaining and fun this franchise has become. To me FF6 is a little but of a guilty pleasure because a series revolving around a group of criminals who stop terrorists by driving cars shouldn't be this good. Honestly, if you tried explaining the plot to the movie to anyone who wasn't familiar with the series, they'd think you were ridiculous for enjoying it. It honestly seems like a soap opera or something, characters coming back from the dead and suffering from amnesia, traitorous friends, dying to save loved ones. It's all so stupid and silly, but it works here and FF6 does what every good sequel should do, it ups the ante and takes what its predecessor's done and kicks it up. FF6 isn't known for its great plots or dialogue, so what it focuses on improving on is bigger and more exciting set pieces. It does a great job of making each piece original and unique, and as a result the movie has 3 or 4 great action scenes and none of them feels like a retread. It's this freshness coupled with the movie's ability to not take itself too seriously that makes it truly entertaining. As a result of all this, I find myself excited to see what the upcoming sequel has in store and am even excited by the rumors that they plan on making parts 8 and 9 too. No series should be able to do this, and yet somehow the Fast and Furious franchise defies the odds much like the driving in the movies defies all sense of physics and gravity.
B001OQCV6K|2.0|I purchased this because for some reason I had the sequel in my movie collection but not the first. I just took it out of the mailer and the case has 'RENTAL' printed in big letters on the cover of it under the artwork. It also has 'RENTAL' printed neatly on the actual disc.<br /><br />I guess I don't care, as I will probably never watch it. It's just that to me 'used' is not the same as a 'rental'. Thankfully there are no scratches on the disc. I have not yet tried it in the player.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This movie totally caught me off guard, it's a great balance of drama, sports, and action. This is a movie that slipped under everyone's radar, it was before Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton became recognizable names, and it's a shame that so many people missed out on this in theaters. I'm not an MMA fan, but the movie makes it easy to engage and follow the sport, and the plot is interesting enough that regardless your thoughts on MMA you'll want to keep watching. It's an intense movie, the action is intense and the characters are complex, and the movie's resolution is satisfying. There's enough in here for anyone to enjoy this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|FANTASTIC BOOK!  The master, Stephen King, has created a plot full of surprises, but with the familiar character of Dan Torrance holding the reins.
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|Superman is a hard character to adapt into a movie, but I think Man of Steel did a good job. It isn't the best movie, it doesn't compare to Batman in the Nolan films, but it's beautiful to look at and entertaining. Hands down better than Singer's Superman Returns. The action is pretty exciting, Snyder definitely knows how to make an action film, but it does get a little over the top at times. Some reviews have mentioned destruction porn, and I do have to admit that the 3rd act is filled with buildings collapsing and Superman going through buildings. The scope of the action and destruction helps make a big film, but it might be the same things that make it a bit of a turn off for some people. It's funny, but now that I think about it, Man of Steel has more destruction than Pacific Rim and that movie is about 20 story tall robots fighting giant monsters in cities.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book!  John Grisham did an excellent job of bringing back Jake Brigance's character in a new way, but as the same character we all loved in A Time To Kill.  Amazing plot that kept me guessing until the end.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Pacific Rim isn't for everyone, but simply put it's exactly what it looks like. It's a big, stupid fun, summer big special effects movie. The dialogue is cheesy and the acting is a little campy, especially Max Martini's Australian accent, but it delivers on the robot vs monster concept. The movie does a great job of creating this sci-fi world, I appreciated how del Toro creates a whole world for the movie to take place in. But like any movie that has a concept like this, if you over think it, it'll fall apart. If you can simply enjoy what's on the screen you'll have a good time, but too much thought and the movie stops being a fun action movie and starts to be a study in movie cliches. Pacific Rim has all sorts of formulaic characters, but balances it out with actors who seem to being having fun and a couple of great action sequences. If you're looking for something that you can turn off your brain and just have fun with, this is a great movie to watch. It's especially good to watch in 3D, the movie has a lot of layers visually and the 3D works well with it (it probably doesn't hurt that much of the action is CG).<br /><br />For those of you who understand this statement, Pacific Rim at its core is a live action anime movie. If you wondered what Voltron or one of those other Japanimations would be like in live action, this is it.
B00GLX0Z8C|3.0|Love Jennifer Anison.  Movie went too far on shock factor and scene with Mexican police office asking for bribe.  Movie had it's moments but could have been much better.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This franchise keeps getting worse and worse. I enjoy stupid action movies, but this one is about as dumb as it gets. The action is bland and the plot is so ridiculous that I was rolling my eyes every 10 minutes. Have you ever heard of a spray that destroys radiation, it's in here. It's sad that a lot of younger folks will watch this and never see the first Die Hard, this is a sad entry into what was once a good franchise. I'm curious, but a little terrified, what Die Hard 6 will be like if they end up making it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I am still thinking about the ending...it was so good! It was too short though. I wanted to read much more, but it was perfect as it was. If you want mystery, adventure, and supernatural, here it is!
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|First I need to say, I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. It's a solid summer action movie, but I'd be lying if I said it was anything more than that. It looks good and moves at a brisk pace, but it lacks any depth or any real surprises. The previous Star Trek had characters that were interesting and were complex, but in this one they're all very one note and flat. Kirk is simply the impulsive captain, Spock the logical alien, and their relationship is simply what you'd expect given those character types and a little witty banter. Even Cumberbatch's character is an under written disappointment, he's definitely the most interesting character in the movie, but given who he is there's so much potential that's wasted. The movie is a fun piece of forgettable sci-fi fun, but nothing more.
B0046A9MRW|4.0|Agatha Christie's One of the best detective novels.  Kindle edition is eminently readable; felt like I was reading the print edition.
B00GTO6X0W|4.0|It's important to begin by saying that this is not the kind of film that everyone will love, it absolutely is the kind of film that will leave most people either surprised and blown away or annoyed that they spent almost 2 hours watching. The movie is more of an experience than a story, so you don't get to know Redford's unnamed character or anything about it, rather you get to experience with him the struggles he goes through to survive. Think of the 2nd act of Castaway, if you took away the first act of that film you wouldn't have connected with Tom Hank's character and would be left watching a man trying to survive. That's exactly what this film does, and it does a great job of not just giving the audience something to watch but really pulls you in. This is in no small part due to the director and Redford's strong performance.<br /><br />If you can handle watching a movie that is more about the experience, and not about a story, this might be a film you'll love. Others might find it boring, as the character doesn't say anything for the most part and at times seems to be doing mundane things. It's this side of the experience that might make people see All is Lost as a slow and pointless film. Personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I know a number of my friends would not like it, and I'm not surprised by it at all.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game its so fun I love how you can choose what to do whenever and I love ho  it's an open world game!!!!!!!
B0056BU3I2|4.0|This is a little bit of a guilty pleasure for me. The best way for me to describe Fast Five is as the spiritual successor to all those great 80's action movies, it's over the top, the heroes can do no wrong, and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. What separates it from a lot of other big action movies is that it knows it's just about being fun, and as a result is able to deliver on being big and dumb and entertaining.<br /><br />Part of what made this movie such a success was the introduction of the Rock's character Hobbs. This was the movie that really cemented the Rock as a big time action hero and franchise saver. If you enjoyed his other movies, like G.I.Joe Retaliation, this is the definitive Rock action movie, even though he isn't the lead. If you're like me, you'll probably be a little embarrassed by how much you'll like the movie, but it's so much fun it's hard not to enjoy it.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is not what I was expecting. IT STOUINKS WHY DO YOU NOT BE ABLE TO SEARCH IT IS SO ANNOYING!!
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|The Piano Guys, bring music to life. Another can't miss album, if you long for music that will carry you away. The only thing better is seeing them in person. My children have a loved seeing them.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Like a good red wine, Rebus just keeps getting better with age.<br />Rankin's &#34;hero&#34; never matures he just grows older.
B00GQ8MZDU|5.0|The question that hangs over the entire series is whether Dexter might have been different if his adoptive father had tried to stem his murderous urges instead of re-directing them.  Instead of don't get caught, suppose Harry had tried to teach Dexter not to kill in the first place?  Was he destined always to be a psychopath?  It seems we are watching in the final installment a Dexter who has evolved.  It's not all about him and getting away with it.<br /><br />This final rendition is less about the thrill of the chase and more about risks and consequences than any other season has been.  That's fitting since this is the end game, and Dexter must ante up his final payment.  How much is he willing to do, and what is the prize he seeks?  His own skin vs. love. Each episode resonates with family themes as Dexter finds his \\"spiritual\\" mother and begins to see at the same time what his existence meant to this father. His battle with his sister who is offering him a most unsisterly love can only grow more fierce when the one woman with whom Dexter is obsessed reenters the picture.  Family--can't live without them, can you kill them?  Even his angelic son manages to take actions that put Dexter severely at risk -- what is a father to do? Dexter is wonderful with Harrison and his patience an object lesson for every parent who has screamed at his or her child in the supermarket.<br /><br />I felt the ending was fulfilling while also being open enough that more story-telling could be appended.  At some point, I hope they come back with even another series or perhaps a movie or two.  But if this is the final, final end, then so be it.  It's works as is.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|It is the type of novel you cannot stop reading. The author plays with time , present and past and you can´t help been trapped by curiosity: what next?
B00AB7HESI|2.0|This is a great game with one exception.  Every time they put out a software update for the Kindle Fire, all game progress is wiped out and reset.  It gets tiresome to continually have to replay the same levels over and over again.  If they had a way for you to save and reload the game when this happens, I would rate this 5 stars.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Ken Follet is Ken Follet, good plot, breathtaking, full of information and interesting details. Worth reading to those who like suspense.
1881273156|5.0|Great insightful book on the differences in how each person relates to the world.  So true that we are all different and if we can relate to those we love in a manner that clicks with them, what a great improvement in relationships.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Great game for people who Love shooting pool and can't  really get away from home , you have a few minutes of time you can relax with a short game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Still waiting for this on my windows phone but at least I have it on my kindle!  It's fun and addicting :)
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I love this game but on my kindle fire it won't let me update it there is two new updates for it and I can't get them and they look like so much fun but I can't get the update and I a not happy about it. The updates have been out for about two weeks and I still can't get the updates. But at the same time this game is really fun with or without the updates.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|Excellent concert by one of the greatest rock bands ever!  I think the guys in their 60s are perhaps even better than they were - maybe since their bad habits are a thing of the past.  Jason is a great drummer but he can't be Bonzo who was unique and in a class by himself.  A must buy!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I can't shut off a video. I close out and the video keeps playing. What the crap! In fact it is still playing from this morning!
B0040UAYI4|1.0|It worked great for 6 months and then started not working for no reason. I contacted penguin United to help me fix it. They said ok they will send me a replacement for it. Now for the last 3 months I've been waiting. I've send so many mails to Devin who was the contact person. They said they have sent it but the tracking number could not be found by the South African postal service. I am very disappointed by their service and making me wait for so long. I even said I will pay for the new ones shipment. Still today I haven't received my eagle eye from them. I recommend you make sure you live in the USA to buy this. Or else you won't receive any service.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|I love this movie great deal came quickly and still in the wrapper I wish I would have gotten full screen instead of wide screen but non the less still a great movie
B009AMANBA|2.0|I had to watch this movie twice! Not because I love it so much! Is because I fell asleep during half time of the movie! Lincoln is a story about the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln and the civil war in America! Lincoln goes thru so many challenges on fighting a war, giving slaves their freedom, getting congressman people to signed his freedom of rights laws, and trying to stop his only son from trying to join the US Army and fight the civil war! Lincoln has a great story to tell to America! But America is not ready to accept Lincoln's story during his time and that was the struggles Lincoln has as President of the United States! There is just to much drama and talks about politics and not enough action! This is why I'm giving this movie two stars! But if you are a student, in High School or in College, and you have to do a History report, I strongly recommend for you to get this movie!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like the way it kept you second guessing. Very neatly twisted. Keeps you turning the pages and your loyalties.
0767817710|5.0|I live in Texas 20 plus years! And in Texas, we still love cowboy movies! The Quick and The Dead is a classic movie and well made cowboy story! The story tells you, how a woman enter into a quick draw gun fight contest, not to win the $100, 000 dollars Wells Fargo price money, but to get revenge on the governor of the town for killing his father, who was the sheriff of the town, whenever she was just a little girl! But the governor was so evil that made a Christian priest enter into the gun fight contest and fight against the woman who wanted nothing but revenge for the murder of his father! This is a must I love to own type of movie! Get it! You won't regret it!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Great and nostalgic.  Not often do I see movies from my childhood that I come back to and say, this is just as good as when I saw it back then but I still love it.
6304711905|5.0|I have lived in Texas 20 plus years! And in Texas, we still love cowboy movies! Tombstone is the all time and best cowboy movie ever made in history! No cowboy movie can ever match or beat this movie! Not even the cowboy movie Young Guns! The story tells you, how three brothers move into a new town, as retired sheriff from Kansas, and trying to start a new life again as regular civilians! But trouble started whenever the leader of the cowboy gang murder the sheriff in town, and no witness to the crime! That's when the three brothers took the job as the new sheriff of town and made the no guns in town laws! The cowboy gang kill one of the brothers and injured the second brother! Leaving one brother left as the sheriff of town! And than, that's when Kurt Russell became a US Marshall who joined forces with Val Kilmer as, &#34;Doc Holiday,&#34; and started hunting down and killing every cowboy gang member who wore a red scarf! This is a must I love to own type of movie! Get it! You won't regret it!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|i love this movie i love the story the ending the effects its def a must watch a moving story as well
B00CE03UOC|5.0|AWSOME NEON FLOW!!!!  This app or you could say game is rated 5 stars because, it is NOT FLOW Free! Flow Free is just plane old but just GREAT! It is just Neon colored AWSOME mazes!!
B005G4TJUC|1.0|I only bought this because I love Transformers. But this movie sucks. Michael Bay sucks. Don't even blame this one on Megan Fox. This is a failure of writing and computer character designers who want to prove to the world that they went to college. I hate this movie. The Autobots show up here and there, but most of the movie is about teenager college kids. Michael Bay is an idiot.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The book is a beautiful account of faith and healing. It is a book you will go back to and reread again.<br />the story is inspiring and the themes life affirming.
1476733953|5.0|A captivating read.  The story moves at a good pace and reveals many layers as you go.  As things are revealed, you realize everyone is doing what they think is best for the community.  It is difficult to discuss the intricacies in any detail without spoiling some of the components of the story, but I found the psychological aspects of their particular scenario fascinating, and it was possible to find yourself empathizing with all the characters, both good and \\"bad\\".  There is a well done blend of action, suspense, and psychological drama in Wool.  This is truly a fascinating world that the author has created.  The last 200+ pages simply fly by.  I felt the climax at the end of the book almost moved too quickly, but the events that unfolded felt true to the characters.  If you like dystopian stories, you should read this book.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Excellent movie had the intensity throughout the whole movie from beginning to end kept you somewhat on the edge of seat throughout very good
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging and addictive!  Hate the wait between the levels but a fun game to play.  Recommend highly...hard to put down.
B008JFUPZI|4.0|It was entertaining, far fetched but entertaining, somewhat interesting plot again far fetched, pretty close to what we have today in Washington DC.<br />Don't blame me you are the one who wanted a long sentence of what I thought of the movie.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I love this series!!!! It looks amazing on Blu-ray and on a HD TV. It has so many different creatures  in it and the camera work is awesome!!! My nephews can sit and watch this all day!! Well worth the buy!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Really fun action movie. Don't expect intellectual revelations just hold on and have a great ride.<br />The combination of actors as well as this story just make this very enjoyable to watch.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not the usual Grisham I have enjoyed in the past.  Not completely finished with it and in no hurry to do so.  It drags a little and gets too wordy.  Looking for to his new one.  Maybe will be better.
B00GNL96H8|2.0|While I had high hopes for this movie based on the story line as well as trailer it sunk well below expectations.<br />I'm sorry to say that this movie is an all over the place fantasy love story which incorporates a great deal of propaganda as opposed to an understanding of Ip Man's Life.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Incredibly thought provoking. Spielberg is a master. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are unbelievable as always. A movie of its own class.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Tougher than some of the other escape game.  Like that, nice challenge, but end of game too soon. Would like to keep on playing.
0767919408|5.0|This will be a favorite of mine, highly recommended!  Very readable and enjoyable history, packaged with Bill Bryson's one-of-a kind style.  When reading Bryson I always feel like he's bewildered, amazed and thrilled all at the same time, and he allows me to share his emotions.  In this case, he makes me want to go back to a time I never knew, the 20's that I see in my parents' photos, where they are forever young and keen on life.  This is his best since Walk in the Woods.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|This is a great book with many insights into how Amazon came to be and how it is operated.  Bezos is an unusual individual and you get a feel for how his mind works.  It is a very worthwhile read.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Aside from Chanum Tatum being one of the finest men out there this movie was brilliant.  Suspenseful with lots of twist and turns that you would not ever suspect.  It definitely kept me on my toes from the beginning to the end.
B00C49GQD0|5.0|Seriously good.  The lead actress plays at least 4 major characters.  Her brother is comedy relief, especially when he makes fun of suburbia.  The boyfriend is great to look at.  But the thing about Clone Club is that you can't tell anyone about it.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This movie was great! Definitely had lots of laughs.  Not very realistic but absolutely entertaining!  The cast was perfect and right on!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Pretty dang crappy adaptation of the book. It should've just been released as a standalone movie. There wasn't anything here to make it rely on being tied to the book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I believe this is one of best works. The theme (JFK Assassination) was well researched and King's writing (as always) is very entertaining and hooks you from the first ten pages. This would make a great movie. I would recommend to all of my reading friends.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Was laughing to tears when I attempted to play this game! I personally didn't get very far because I was cracking up too much. The kids I babysit for LOVED the game and got to levels I can't begin to get to! I let them install it on their device at home and they are having s ball with it. Am hoping to sit down and be composed enough to learn the game myself.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It is entertaining! The Time it takes for some item takes to long. But it does help pass the time if your waiting for a few mins at a time.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Good game that takes me back to my youth. Difficult to operate the control without a good old fashioned joystick.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Such a good app my cousins enjoy talking to him and punching him such a good app for children I recommend this for everyone
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Best Dr. Who I have seen in a long time. Well worth the purchase price. This episode explains a lot!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and how everyone of the characters where somehow intertwined.  I stayed up way past my bedtime for several nights because I couldn't wait to read what would be revealed next.  I will definitely recommend this book to my friends and book buddies!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Good story and well written.  Interesting narrator kept the plot moving.
B00EDX5QNG|5.0|My favourite album of 2013 is Psychic by Darkside.  It's electro-dream-sound scape rock with enough ProSounds twiddles, blips and hiss to make it psychedelia. It's also just a good place to escape: electro-trance that, one expects, is played at an after-, after-party in the Balearics or Goa or wherever else rich people go to dance their headaches off.<br /><br />Like all good albums it's made up from a patchwork of influences that add up to something bright and new.  Bits of Psychic are like Can's Future Days dissembled by XX or Young Marble Giants.  The guitar parts float in from P-Funk's magnificent Maggot Brain while most of it is re-imagined `90s and `00s rock-tronica (think Underworld, Aphex Twin and Portishead rather than Moby or Norman Cook).<br /><br />A few of the tracks can only really be described as odd (Greek Light and Sitra) but when the album gets going and back to the beat it really rocks.  For me there's been nothing quite as interesting, musically, this year.<br /><br />IMHO, Psychic and particularly the key tracks Golden Arrow, Paper Trails and Freak, Go Home are the latest entrants into the pantheon of space-rock.  Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is the obvious reference here and Psychic builds on that some 40 years later.  While the mechanics, the instruments and the voices are different the album art and the fragmentation suggest space, disconnection and disorientation.  Like Floyd, Darkside's sound scapes are either otherworldly and ethereal or homely, comfortable and numb.  But, unlike Floyd, Psychic seems to offer closure and, through that, satisfaction and contentment.  If all rock music is about release the perfect audience for this album are moon-miners, home exhausted but happy after a hard day scrabbling for meteors.
B001AQO400|1.0|This movie should have been &#34;lost&#34; well before any &#34;translation&#34; of it was available to the viewing public!  I made my decision to add this film to my collection based, in part, on the reviews it was receiving at the time.  How I wish I'd only rented this aimless, boring, monstrosity!<br /><br />Pass this one up.  You won't be sorry!!
B00AGYM0DU|5.0|had to keep going, just like Ruth in the story, I needed to know what would happen. fascinating insight into modern Japanese culture and the old and new.
0061950726|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I couldn't put it down nor did I want it to end. It is a book to be treasured!!! I even cried at the end of the book!!!!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I love this app so much! You feel like you're driving a real car and it reminds me a lot of a video game rather than just a free app. It doesn't freeze up at all, and its not too difficult. Overall a GREAT app!
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|I haven't used this regularly, but it seems to do a reasonable job of making pdf's into an audio media. Not bad for listening to on the way to work.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I do not like planes, so some of the scenes were disturbing and the storyline a bit depressing, however, it also had moments that would make you laugh. An engaging and thought-provoking movie. The acting of Denzel, John Goodman and Don Cheedle was great.  An unexpected ending.  I loved this movie.  As a fan of Denzel's movies I would have to say this was probably his best.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Really enjoyed the way the book describes the relationship and dependencies between the lines of business and IT.<br />Also very helpful for anyone trying to sell to IT, as it helps to understand how budget is related to business objectives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting! You won't be able to stop playing. Many of my friends are addicted too! LOL :-)
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This application is a ok I haven't really seen what it does so I can't really say to much about the application
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|If you ever carve out the time to find the documentary, Breathing Lessons, that contains interviews with Mark O'Brien, the courageous man on whose life the movie, The Sessions, is based.  I hope you will remain as touched and inspired as I was by this man who tried to live a full life in spite of the most difficult hand dealt him.  The movie, The Sessions, as most Hollywood movies are prone to do, glamorizes his life, suggests a perpetual sunny disposition and a facility with charming woman.  The real Mark O'Brien in the documentary spoke of passing many hours alone, dealing with a roach-infested apartment, and women perpetually keeping him at arm's length.  There's a bit of a disconnect there, but in spite of the Hollywood-applied fairytale veneer, there is much to celebrate in this movie.  It is hard to come away from this movie and not feel profoundly inspired by Mark O'Brien.  In spite of being imprisoned by his body and tethered to an iron lung, Mark O'Brien seemed to seek out ways to still experience the journey of life as best he could.  One can't help but revel in both his spirit and his sharp mind.<br /><br />In addition, what makes this movie a very worthy watch and one to own is the virtuoso performances turned in by the two leads, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.  Both inhabited their characters with such grace and beauty.  I was particularly amazed by John Hawkes.  Playing Mark O'Brien is light years' away from the the dark figure Mr. Hawkes plays in Winter's Bone.  What versatility! It is a great shame that he was overlooked for an Oscar nomination. He was most deserving.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written!  One of those books that are painful to read and yet hard to put down.  Inside the story of Germans during WW2.
B0091QS88K|1.0|Every time I click on it, it goes back  to home so if you have a kindle fire do not get this app.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It is a simple game and it looks great and keeps the brain occupied.  Kids and adults will love it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love these guys' music--fabulous! They make great music, they love what they do, and it shows! Great music for me.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like the way the gameplay is designed its fun and more involved than a plant harvest sell repeat. The crafting items to use on quests is a nice change of pace especially when you can finish things without the necessity of friends.
B0015FWRHS|5.0|Very solid album. These guys found something here, great trio and I recommend you check them out on YouTube as we'll.
B008JFURII|5.0|Drama, Intrigue, Suspense & Humor.  It packs it all in.  We loved this movie. RED-Retired extremely dangerous has it all.  As good as Red 1.
B002WHQAGC|3.0|Like all compilations this one is certainly missing some of her best, or maybe some of her best that I like.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Though flight premise was a stretch, the alcohol addiction was well depicted.  Goodman's portrayal of drug supplier was way out<br />and funny.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I just saw them in concert (again) this past November and had to get this for my husband. It was delivered to us quickly and is WONDERFUL!!! I've got to buy a couple more for Christmas gifts... Yes it's THAT good that it needs to be shared.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|This game is good!! U should totally get this app! But they should add more weapons and heroes. But u should totally get this app no matter how boring other people think this is. There should be many other apps like this.<br />GTA now means GET THIS APP!!!<br />G= Get<br />T= This<br />A= App!!!!!!
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|The detail of his journey is amazing!<br />I am in awe of their will to survive.<br />This book gives me hope in my own life.
B00004WNNW|5.0|I got into Tom Waits with his album &#34;Big Time&#34; many many years ago. Its only recently that I have gone back to his old stuff. This has to be my favorite album. I almost listen to it daily.
B00GLP47UM|5.0|My daughters and I have listened to this everyday since it came out, we love the movie and the songs are so much fun. Tangled was terrible, and Brave fell short, but Disney finally got back on track with this one.
1595828753|5.0|Good book I liked it then when I was done reading it I returned it and got a refund to buy the next one
0736430512|5.0|I don't know how you condense an hour and 40 min. movie into a Little Golden Book but it was done very well. My daughters saw the movie and loved it so much that I picked this up for them. It is written very well. Of course some of the details had to be left out but I've read this at least twice a day since it came in.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I like good positive coming of age stories.<br />They could do a follow on show ten years later with the same crew saving the day when the aliens return.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|Classic!<br />Really enjoyed viewing classic with the whole family able to watch the movie .All I can say is good, good, good.
B0086449YA|3.0|I have really enjoyed Mark Knopfler's solo work. I appreciate his songcraft and increasingly subtle guitar work. This collection is not without those attributes; however, the songs just didn't connect with me this time. Too much blues- not enough melody.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Well, I must admit I miss Portnoy a little, but sentiment aside Mangini's a fine replacement. Some people complained about the mix but I think it sounds fine on my system (unlike Rush's latest). The show & production are on a par with Budokan. My only nitpick is the few &#34;artsy visuals&#34;  they throw into show.I want to watch the band, not gorillas & godzillas. Very fortunately they are few & far between or I'd be knocking stars off left & right. Not my thing at all. Over all a good show, well captured, & worthy of watching multiple times.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I am totally enjoying the new version.  I do wish I could start over.  also the upgrades are somewhat confusing on how to change what you want.
B006UIUJ2A|2.0|Although the North Korean reality is well described the story is difficult to follow due to a constant mixture of themes and persons. At the end of the book I had the feeling that The Pulitzer award was not really deserved due to a lack of any writing and fiction intensity and novelty. All in all a pretty deceiving book!
0385349947|4.0|This is a great book.  It confirmed so many things I have been feeling at work and wondering if it was all me - turns out its mostly because I am a female.<br /><br />I dont think this book provides answers - but just bringing the problem of women and power out in the open is a huge step forward
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of missle comand of course, and that's what I love. I got as a free app of the day years ago, and still love it.
1936608898|4.0|This book has helped me change my eating habits and is moving me in a direction of healthy living.  The book is clear and offers a lot of information and shows you where to find even more information and recipes
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple to start but builds in difficulty. ONLY game to still my high intellect/high energy granddaughter. I am not a gamer but I find this game kind of soothing....great for slightly obsessive compulsive.
B000J4OYRW|5.0|Really nice plush, well made and with good touch. Funny, your kids (or maybe you) would love it. Don't forget partner Crocodile Gena.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game absolutely blew my mind away and every battle is a heart pounding moment that will keep you playing for a long time and besides it is worth the long download.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Ever since I saw this movie on VHS I wished they'd sell a higher definition version as the special effects and detail were pretty cool. After finding out that all the effects were non-computer generated I found it all the more interesting and special. This is a great piece of history and one of Harrison Ford's best performances in my opinion.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|This is definitely one of the more fun time management games around! You won't be disappointed if you download this game
B008JFUS8M|2.0|I really enjoyed the movie until the end. The ending was one of the worse I've ever seen. Why? Simply because there was no ending! It was like watching a movie that breaks at Intermission. Unfortunately it was not the Intermission but the end of the movie. I am not against sequels & quite enjoy them, but all movie goers deserve a proper ending ... without having to wait 2 years for the movie to continue ... my opinion, without any criticism whatsoever of the actors ...
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I had 3 dollars left over in my account and wanted to spend the and I was searching random things that can relate to my iPhone and I looked up tripods for my iphone and got this tripod and it's alright. Just expected for the tripod to be a little bit more taller<br /><br />It's up to you if you want to buy a tripod for your iphone or camera or whatever you have.
1609611543|5.0|I read the book from cover to cover and use it as a reference very often.  I suffered from painful plantar fasciitis for years and took medicines, injections, special shoes and orthotics.  I also had arthritis pain in my hands and hips and it never occurred to me that it may be all the wheat I was eating.  I stopped all wheat, which was not easy to put it mildly, this stuff seems to be in everything.  I'm German and I'm married to an Italian, we love pasta & bread.  Well, after two weeks of cravings and headaches, I suddenly had relief.  The carb cravings went away and so did the pain in my feet.  I can walk barefoot again, something that was impossible for 7 years.  I walk my dogs every day now.  I take no more meds or special shoes.  I have less heart burn, less gas & bloating, less headaches, more energy and the arthritis pain is all gone.  This book is truly an eye-opener and it has changed my life.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|It is a decent game for passing time, but can be a challenge when facing overpowered computer opponents that outmatch your health and card number
B009LDCXNY|4.0|It would be a sad day should discs become no more. The thought of being totally web dependent is sad beyond words. As things evolve we come to enjoy series such as Supernatural. Series are going to have formulas and after a season or two you have the one for the series you are watching. The question of when are they going to Jump the Shark comes to play like with Smallville. Supernatural isn't quite there but close enough that one really doesn't need to wait a week or even hope to find it On Demand. Wait for those times when homebound like when illness strikes or snowbound. Have a Supernatural Party and go through the season. Works well also for most HBO shows like True Blood. With in ten minutes, if a fan you will remember, where you left off come up to speed and be well into the season. At the end of the last disc you won't feel rushed to see the sequel as you can smile confident that next year there will be another snow storm or some other house binding event and you will all have something to look forward to. True all have to live tell then, but should this not be you may find that Supernatural isn't Science Fiction.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|This is a complete serie full of feelings and emotions<br />There is a lot of problems that the team had to resolve and this<br />make the serie more interesting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Captivating and Intriguing.  Such a heart-wrenching story of fate and love.  This book should come with a warning that you will not be getting any sleep until you finish this book.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Colleeen Hoover doesn't disappoint.  She is an amazing author that uses her stories to make you think and hug your loved ones a little tighter that night.
B0053O89KG|5.0|We were expecting that this two talk about the feelings they had for each other<br />I realy enjoy this season and i hope the next season be better
007174889X|5.0|Good reference and resource. Only turn afew pages. I use more on the online form. Recommend it. Good to keep at home. Not convenient to carry it along. I usually use it for presentations.
B009G41CG2|5.0|This is a fun game to play... It is one of the games I play the most when I'm on.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used and tested many keyboards for android phones and tablets and for the phone I would say this is by far my favorite and what I consider to be the best.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Amazing analysis of what's wrong at the core of our obsession with technology.  We trust in the infallibility of others, even in the workings of weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />This book should be a must read for any technologist, and especially for any one who wants to learn about the most frightening facts of the recent history of the USA.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Actually syncs with your Facebook and it's an great game to play and Dustin is so wrong so is my cousin. You should get this game.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|The best series I've seen since Heroes.  Outstanding acting, interesting characters, adequate special effects, great story. Watched marathon style on Amazon Prime instant video because I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is fantastic, the game is super addicting! I absolutely love it and it is a must have for EVERYONE!!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|The best series I've seen since Heroes.  Outstanding acting, interesting characters, adequate special effects, great story. Watched marathon style on Amazon Prime instant video because I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game took for ever to come out on the kindle but it is finally here. This game does not disappoint.

B005IQZB14|3.0|I probably would not have elected to read this book had it not been chosen by my book group.  Still I found Miss Strayed's adventures on the trail interesting.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|The best series I've seen since Heroes.  Outstanding acting, interesting characters, adequate special effects, great story. Watched marathon style on Amazon Prime instant video because I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Because the book was awesome and it told about Spanish German and  other kinds of stuff like French and English
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Wonderful, true love story. Not the fairy tale ending I am used to, but this is true life and hard choices that real people make all the time.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I find what I am looking for easily and Google assist me even when I am not sure I gave it a four because there is always room for improvements
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I did not like the book.  I truly don't want to read about this kind of world. It's getting too close to reality
B004P9MRLM|5.0|Idris as a conflicted, imperfect detective savant. Great stuff. Be advised: Pretty dark.<br />Caveat: Season 3 wrapped last summer, and that's apparently all there is or will be. So there may already be a &#34;complete set&#34; edition now; haven't looked.<br />Our only complaint: We want more Luther!<br />An aside: One of our best tech purchases (for under $100) ever was a no-region DVD player. About 90-percent of the sets we've purchased have been UK series not widely available, or available at all, in US format.<br />Even for those boxed sets that have a US format counterpart, the lower price of the UK sets has already paid for our player several times over.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|The offshoot from the Cars franchise is Planes. Although it looks the part, it just simply doesn't have the &#34;heart&#34; that the original Cars film had, but it will hold a child's attention fine enough. It uses much of the original Cars plot lines and character development to tell a similar story.<br /><br />When viewing animated features, I base my opinion on whether or not the voice actors brought excitement and range to their characters. This film was awful in that department. The only characters with any sort of inflection and emotion in their voices was Chug (Brad Garrett) and El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui). Everyone else was flat and uninspired.<br /><br />Bottom line: It certainly &#34;looks&#34; like a Pixar film, but it lacks that &#34;it&#34; factor that usually makes Pixar films special.
014312336X|5.0|This was an excellent book -  A murder mystery, sociological study and history of Peking at the end of the Western dominance of this city.  While telling the story of the murder of Pamela Werner, Paul French gives one a trenchant view of Chinese and Western life immediately preceding the Japanese military occupation of Peking at the end of the 1930's.  What a wonderful book!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Awesome introduction for me into the world of bodyweight training. Covers everthing you need to know to get a great workout anywhere without equipment and no gym needed
B000YHC9WQ|5.0|American History X is a brilliant film.  Norton Should have won the Oscar.  Supporting cast has often been criticized for being one dimensional.  I find this criticism unfounded.  The little brother has a complete worldview, albeit skewed by his upbringing.  Some of the &#34;gangster&#34; types (both skinhead and black) are rather simple, but this fits with there characters.  They aren't intended to portray criminal masterminds.  They reflect the reality of the average &#34;member.&#34;  People with better options usually find one.  Those who lack the brains to lead or strike out on their own path, follow.  e.g. Our large friend really IS pretty dumb.  Being an exterminator is probably the most complicated job he can manage (I suspect he's either not very good at it, or only knows what he absolutely needs to know.  He probably only works for the real exterminator).  Anyway, the debate about the supporting cast, aside, Norton's performance would carry the movie even if you acceded to the supporting cast issue.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I very good complicated story, kept you interested and wanting to know how it would end. The conclusion was a surprise, but a fitting end.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This film is VERY well done.  Reasonably good plot, VERY good acting, and strongly written dialogue for the actor's to work with.
6305508550|5.0|JUST ASK LUMBERGH THIS MOVIE IS GREAT AND YOU DONT NEED TO FILL OUT A TPS REPORT TO GET IT
B0052RCX0G|5.0|This is a world history like no other.  It provides a context for the history that is awesome.  The objects chosen where not chosen because they were famous, but because they illustrated the civilization they were from, in a way that makes the civilization real to you.  It's no longer how primitive they were, but how advanced they were.  .
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Not as good as the first, better than the second. It was exactly what I expected it to be. Kept me entertained on a long flight.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It works very well on my android phone. I have the new Samsung Note III and Kindle for android works quite well with it.
B00F3VOL38|3.0|While completely worth having, I don't find this as exciting as Vol 1 was when it was originally released. Vol 1 had so many previously unreleased songs that it was staggering. Vol 2 contains different versions of some of the same songs as Vol 1 with very little music that isn't available anyplace else. Beautiful Dreamer? Sure, they are different versions but for a casual listen they don't sound that different. Then 1/3rd of the album is interviews which on the vinyl version make up 1 entire disk. The vinyl version was expensive & I would have preferred to have just the music and radio dialogue. Since the cd is pretty reasonably priced it isn't a problem with that version but after you've heard the interviews once it's enough. As I said this is very much worth having but is not the revelation of Vol 1. If you don't already have vol 1 the box with both volumes is really great. I keep hoping for a legit release of the Christmas Collection, maybe next year?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Definitely a great game. My only complaint is that you have to connect to Facebook to do the ship and if course encourages you to get your friends involved. But besides that, I'm enjoying the game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Engrossing story of young girl during WW two in Germany. Make sure you have tissues. Brings to light the suffering of local German people during Hitler's reign.
B00992CF6W|1.0|My update is messed up<br />I mean really messed up I need to change it back I demand a refund
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|It was fun and challenging . I am looking forward to the sequel. You were not sure how it was going to end
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I loved this game .. its was nice and everything but I did seem to short I was expicting to having to kill the witch another way then just popping the bubbles???? this game only took me 1 day to finish it yet it was still one of the best :) &lt;3
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A lot of fun but very aggravating at the same time. I'm not a true gamer but spend a lot of hours with this one. I like the pace!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and it is free this is the best game ever this is in my top 5 favorite games
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like this game. So far so good. :) I'm already addicted and I just started playing. LOL I hope it stays that way.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm on facebook several times a day. I keep in touch with relatives and friends. I also play a few of the games.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest ever! I can never get enough of Elf. I'm just so surprised that there isn't a book that goes along with the movie (like the one that is created in the movie itself!)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|The best part of this book is how the speaker sees through all of the deception and brings the truth, however painful it my be.  Someone give Ender a break though, hasn't he suffered enough?
B00EAZTONU|5.0|The bonus features make it worth it and the weta sculpture was very cool as well. Considering most of there sculptures are $100+ by themselves it was a great deal
B000LC3ICY|5.0|I haven't seen a series of movies like this since I don't know when,  keeps me on the edge of my seat.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Nice to keep in touch with the family and friends. Keeping in the know. Pictures are clear. Facebook on my kindle! YES
B001AQTWF2|5.0|A collectors item.  I have all of her music and this is great after a long time away from music
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I would like to see the champion of each episode posted, otherwise so glad it's on my kindle! I am adicted!!!
B001P3SA94|5.0|Excellent movie that I will look at many times over.  I love music and movies with music and a message are great
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Gregory Porter is  a powerful talent. Once you hear him you will be searching for more cd's by him. He is excellent as a live performer too. If you like soulful music with a combination of jazz and positive words you will love him. This one you can play in the car with your kids.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is a fun and exciting game for all. I highly recommend this game to anybody. this game also has probibly the best graphics I have ever seen GLU have on any of their games.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Maple Fire does it right again! excellent game play.  good thinking puzzles. great graphics, it's all here!  the first two games were fun too.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I loved the whole setting and tone of these books. First off its a world that can easily be our fate.  And the lies people are told mirrors the world of today as well. Initially I was a little turned off by what seemed to be a recurring theme that the good guys are doomed but then Hugh offers us realistic hope.  I will read everything Hugh Howey has written, he receives far to little compensation for his work.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Re-watching this series and loving it more than ever!  There is so much more information when you know where the story is going.
B008602KQI|5.0|Fantastic. I was truly surprised at how good this movie is. I immediately started reading the book! I can't wait for the next movie to come out....lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well done. Story keeps the reader k. The edge of their seat with it's plot and delivery. You will be cheering the Victors on yourself.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm so in love with this set of books. Not only are they extremely sexy, but the love story is so true to life! I'm going to miss these characters so much! Hoping this is not the end?
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good read. Classic Grisham. As usual he doesn't disappoint... The ending is unexpected, as usual, and leaves you smiling. If you like Grisham, you will like this book.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The writing took me right into the story and kept me there. I did not find it prediciible, that kept my interest. Good character development.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|All iterations of this game are enjoyable and a good way to fill in idle time. Everybody in my home enjoys it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Gritty, real, heartbreaking and completely engaging. This book is so far from the simple entertainment of the Harry Potter books that I wouldn't have believed it was the same author.
014241543X|5.0|Mia and her family stay home one winter day.  Mia is a part of a musical family. Her parents were big musicians and now do things on the side while Mia is a major violin player. Mia is amazingly talented that gets accepted to Julliard. Besides music, Mia also loves her boyfriend Adam, they are just perfect for each other. In the book Mia and her family decided to take a trip to her grandparents, while on the way they get into a major car accident that kills them all except for Mia. Mia now lives at the hospital in a comma, with little possibility of waking up or healing from her injuries. As the book goes on Mia does begin to heal and with Adam by her side she is able to wake up at the end of the book. I give this book 5 stars.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Kind of dated and very preachy in spots, but Henry Fonda and the rest of the cast does a fine job telling the sad story of Okie migrant workers during the Depression. How true it is to reality is hard to say. Often literature and movies sway our thinking into believing things were as depicted in a work of fiction, while maybe in reality it was not generally that way. It is not like someone is going to write a book or make a movie touting how great the agricultural interests were in exploiting the poor Okies. It would not make for much of a book or much of a movie<br /><br />I have not read the book so do not know how well it follows the book.<br /><br />The movie does seem to turn into a bit of a propaganda piece for federal government run migrant camps at the end. I believed the story as it went along until it got to that point. For some reason the kindly older man running the government migrant camp just annoyed me. I think he looked too much like FDR. But, that was a small part of an otherwise powerful movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found this book fast moving, a page turner. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to other readers, now I am going to read the first two.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Extremely witty show with excellent cast.  Good balance of drama and humor that makes show entertaining. Cannot wait for new episodes.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|One of the better Glu games.  You have to grind if you don't want to pay but it is doable.  Multiplayer can be fun and it is a good way to get levels and elements. My whole family played it so it is fun to play together.  Only wish multiplayer had more than two people at a time.
B003KVKQB4|4.0|One of the best books I have read lately.  The author does a great job of explaining what happens when economics and world politics collide.  I would have given the book 5 stars if the author did not dedicate so much of the book to one area (South America).
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I can't really put into words how much I loved this book. I too have a Don in my life. He may be weird to others, but he is amazing to me.
0224087444|5.0|The book provides a depiction of Cixi in a different light than she has previously been seen.  Cixi here is an important historical figure who shaped modern China, rather than a ruthless, selfish, moniacle leader.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished reading this for the second time and couldn't put it down!  Definitely one of the best books (series) I've read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it and usually I'm picky when it comes to books. I have no words it's just that amazing
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just loved the era and the acting was great.  Almost everything about it was good.  Costumes, sets, you name it.  The story is also very believable, I liked the way it changed with each season making the clothing more up to date for the era.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Psychosexual describes this show pretty spot on. So many great twists, it's a little twisted in the head, and it can be very very sexy. Gotta love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read it several times and still can't put it down. Great characters and good writing. The entire series is amazing.
B0026S1XD2|5.0|The reason for THIS rating is that Mike Oldfield is quite a GREAT MUSICIAN!  THIS required QUITE A LOT OF TIME to compose~~Not to mention  PUT IT TOGETHER IN THE STUDIO!!!!!!!  In the EARLY 70s, it was/had to be done the 'OLD FASHIONED WAY&#34;!  For LACK OF A BETTER TERM!  Sure there WAS TECHNOLOGY THEN~~Though NOT EVERYTHING was simply &#34;PUSHING A BUTTON&#34; to make it happen!!!!!!!  It was A BIT MORE INVOLVED!!!!!!!  LOTS OF REEL TO REEL TAPE!  Timing was NOT IMPORTANT~~IT WAS EVERYTHING!!!!!!!  Pots of COFFEE?  YOU BET!!!!!!!  Sleepless Nights?  DON'T EVEN ASK!!!!!!!  However, when you heard the FINISHED PRODUCT~~Was WORTH IT ALL & THEN SOME!!!!!!!  I suppose THAT's why I appreciate THIS ALBUM AS I DO!  I know SOME of WHAT WENT INTO MAKING IT HAPPEN!!!!!!!
0060853972|3.0|After reading &#34;American Gods&#34; by Gaiman, I can see where his influence and writings come into play in this book. I haven't fully read anything by Terry Pratchett so I'm sure that hurt me in seeing where his influence came in. Overall, this was a fun and quick read. There were several characters I enjoyed reading like the angel, Aziraphale, and demon, Crowley, and there were some I didn't as much enjoy. I thought Adam was rather boring for being the antichrist even though the story called him to be a bit more subdued. Pulsifer was very uninteresting but his character was suppose to be quirky and bland. Really, Aziraphale and Crowley were the best written and I believe it's the characters we most get to know. Everyone else feels like underdeveloped side characters which is odd after reading &#34;American Gods&#34; where it seems like everyone is flushed out in detail.<br /><br />Quite frankly, that's my biggest complaint about this book. At just under 400 pages it does seem really disjointed. There are plot points that pop up rather quickly and jarred me. It doesn't seem as if there is enough detail that really gave me a clear picture of all that was happening. For example, UFOs and aliens just appear and it goes from affecting one of the main characters to just being mentioned that it's happening around the world. Where they come from is hinted at and while it's nice that not everything is clearly spelled out (a staple of all things I've read of Giaman's) it seemed a bit unnecessary when it happens again and again.<br /><br />That being said, it is a quick read and rather fun. There are some homages to movies like &#34;The Omen&#34; and &#34;The Exorcist&#34; and other media like that. The interactions between the good and bad guys were comical and the most interesting. The ending is a bit of a let down with the very, very end being a nice smiling &#34;ohhhhh, I get it&#34; moment.<br /><br />A quick read, a few entertaining characters, a story that doesn't NEED to spell out everything, and some subdued comedy makes for a good read. Final Grade - B-EED to spell out everything, and some subdued comedy makes for a good read. Final Grade - B-
B0053B347M|5.0|It does everything I expected it to... Light my keyboard.<br /><br />Ignore this bit, Amazon requires more words in the review.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book.  The author has such talent for bringing characters to life.  The &#34;misremembered man&#34; will be remembered for a very long time, with both smiles and tears.  It's one of the books that you wish would not end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|High quality graphics, and fun story line, what more could you ask for? Definitely a top notch game! Personally I love it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love the console version and now I can get bonuses for both versions! Couldn't be happier! great game and free at that
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I first played it on my brothers tablet and just had to get it! It's so addictive and challenging too.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|Pollan is a good story teller. I enjoyed reading the book. I do wish he had used some simple recipes in the last section. The ones he used were just too complicated. They certainly were not for someone wanting to start cooking with the family for the first time.
0385537131|5.0|The book was like new. I was very pleased and will order the used books again.Din't know what you mean by headline but everything was fine.
B007XZYTVG|5.0|best record by journey i ever heard and it plays and looks like new cover art looks awesome no rips a tears in cover and no scratches in record and it arrived on time the packaging was great and keep the record neat
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Loving my new watch, only just today got it in the mail and was really impressed by the quality. Couldn't be happier. I'll let y'all know if I have any problems in the future.  Edit: Its been nearly three years since I purchased this watch and its still going strong, I cant believe the quality for the price. Still my edc three years later!
1878424319|5.0|Loved the book, one to keep around to remind you from time to time how to live everyday and how to decode ourselves and to unload baggage from the past!
0399159347|5.0|Good book, kept my attention throughout; surprise ending.  I recommend it for anyone who loves a good story.  Read it straight through.
1442362537|5.0|The story gave me what I expected from Stephen King.  It was interesting to see how Danny chose to deal with his experiences from his childhood.  I also appreciated the fact that this was available as an audio CD I could listen to when I was driving in my car.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this show completely; can't wait for Season 4!  My whole family watches it together, even my husband and my cats.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played. the first day I got the game my family and I got over one thousand fish.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|Protects the kindle nicely, but is awkward to use in practice.  Must remove the Kindle to use, but for inexpensive travel protection it works...
B00881VLCE|4.0|This app allows for hours upon hours of puzzle fun!  Not only divided into different categories, animals, nature, etc, but also allows you to customize how many pieces you want the puzzle divided into. Great puzzle fun for the whole family!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is a lot of fun and zinc is spend  a lot of time in waiting rooms, an interesting time killer.
0061122416|2.0|I know Paulo Coelho has a big group of admirers, and when I was a teenager I was one of them. However, I re-read this book now, in my forties, and although I still like the basic story, now I notice that the author tries too hard to teach his readers. All pages of the book are lessons filled with spiritual wisdom. The problem is that it's too much. You can notice the effort the author is making, and it spoils the effect.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just started playing it today and can t put it down. Would be 5 star rating if it didn't keep trying to get me to buy stuff.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|I read the reviews before I got the game.  Not so hot on the reviews. BUT, I'm a big fpr fan, so I went for it anyway. And I gotta say, IT'S WORTH IT!  Stay with it to get passed the issues, (inverted screen, game freeze, lag......)  and it's THE best fpr (first person racer) I've played on the kindle fire hd. Oh btw, if ya wanna win, you'll need a lot of money.  Cold hard cash. But hey, nothing free right?  Front or all wheel drive is really fun, only got one rwd so far, and it's like the e-break is stuck on.  Kinda bs.  But all that aside, good time/ money waster, lmao.  Go getcha some!
B0026IUXME|5.0|Excellent acting by Adrien Brody. Suggest not for kids. Should have had a little more music based on the title of the movie
B005NKIQ26|5.0|Showed up in original packing and undamaged. Don't know how the sound quality is as it's intended as a gift and hasn't been used yet.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Get this if you have any interest in jazz.<br />Mingus' best album, IMO.  his best known album, and also one if his best.  It's a great album all the way through.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|love these types of games, they're fun to play &amp;a great time killer. easy to pick up but does get challenging the bigger the boards.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I watched this series in advance of the 50th Anniversary and I don't regret it.  Donna Noble is one of the greatest companions of all time.  I started the series thinking I would hate her, but she delivers on every level.  Of course, the whole series isn't about her, but certainly there will be some people who are hesitant because of the switch in companions.  If you're one of those, just know that the series is even better because the Doctor finally has a real FRIEND.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This was a excellent game I am very please with the g<br /><br /> ameplay the powerhouse are  a little ridiculous though
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well minecraft is a fun game but it gets boring because  they don't have the  other monsters and you can't update but otherwise okay :-)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is very challenging but it is a problem solving puzzle so you have to think. I highly recommend this app
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Loved it. Waiting for the next one.  There isn't anyone like Rebus.  He is one of a kind . thanks to author Ian Rankin
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's time consuming and grabs your attention. The game is the best when wanting to do a puzzling game. I am going to go play it now.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I love to play this game! They have completely fallen in love with the minions and their costumes.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent examples of passion for perfection. Illustrates the advantages of concentrating on a few projects and that results, not effort count. AND that the person had flaws like other folks.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Downloaded this as it was free. Did not expect too much from it but I've found this game really very addictive.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is really good I have it on xbox too and they are both good even the controls are easy on here! I just wish more people played online.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Highly entertaining ! I wish is more season, they should continue Firefly some how, any way was a good science fiction series.
B00BJ7G1VK|4.0|Good book for cooking instructions and helpful advice. Way too many pictures of the author in cute Paris scenes, she is very pretty, but I would have rather seen more pictures of food. The recipes I have made were great, the lavender chicken was my favorite.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Performance meets my expectation. I have an 2012 Mac Air and it works flawlessly. Can't go wrong with an accessories straight from Apple
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Simple fun! 7 year old loves this game. Great on my kindle fire. Simple to under stand. Download and enjoy.
0393327345|5.0|Great book. There's a reason they made it into a movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big enough for seeing without glasses.  Buttons are just right for big hands and half blind husbands.  Great for little folks too.
0062238868|1.0|The language was very foul.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I didn't really like this game it kept freezing up and was hard to play on my kindle I didn't like how you had to buy the worlds
B00632HWOG|3.0|It would be great if the tabs were available and sorting mail is not made simple must always use search to sort mail
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The ads drive me bonkers and waiting for your next scratch, but otherwise wicked awesome game to play! A must download.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Love this game,but since the first update my fire has been running slowly and won't fun this game at all now. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. No luck though. Plus my fire is still running slow even after uninstalling it again.
0316067598|5.0|It is a well written and a solid story of the struggles our heroes endure that should be shared.  A must read for young adults and all others needing a reminder of why America is exceptional.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I have wanted an app too take videos with for a LONG time..and I finaly got one.So my thoughts on it...Pretty good..but sometimes when I go to take a video ..it stops and says..CAMERA HAS STOPPED.Overall its a good app..takes good pictures..and is great if you have a kindle and want to be able to take videos. :)
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I love this documentary. So glad I bought it. I don't usually buy dvds but I will be watching this with different people to share the story. Orca whales are so fascinating to me.
B0083B3KOQ|1.0|I downloaded this app specifically to convert .epub files to .mobi so I could read my existing books, but the app failed each time to do this. I want my money back
076780421X|4.0|Scratched on one side but there are two sides of the disc (full screen/wide screen) so it's ok. I don't have a preference on which side to watch it on.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Worked seamlessly so far. Easy to use. Both USB ports very functional. I charge a Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S4 simultaneously and it was a breeze. Both charged quite quickly. Haven't tried charging an Apple product though.  Great so far.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I love Denzel Washington who is a superb actor. The beginning of the movie was a &#34;sit on the edge of the chair, nail biter&#34; but then it kind of went downhill.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I don't like it because it freezes don't update doesn't show anything<br />then when you go to other people's farms it pretends to have it mine
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never get tired of reading this, it's one of my favorite stories.  I'm definitely team Peeta, Lol, such an imaginative story, love both book one and two.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Ok... so I read a lot of apocalyptic novels, series, etc. That includes many different books/series on zombies. I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead. I have also read World War Z over a year ago, before the movie.<br /><br />This movie is NOT the book. This movie is not your typical zombie flick. This movie is not what you might expect after reading World War Z.<br /><br />Leave your expectations at the intro of this movie. Enjoy it on it's own merits. It is not the greatest movie of all time, but if you look at  all movies on the zombie genre, you would be lying if you say this isn't the best battle-oriented, action-packed effort on fighting zombies.<br /><br />I am very hard on movies. I am not a huge Brad Pitt fan, but I gave it the benefit of my doubt.. and I am glad I did. It was an intense, and exciting movie, with a complex plot.<br /><br />I hope it earned enough $ for Hollywood that we'll get to see more apocalyptic books brought to the big screen or even the smaller screen (TV).<br /><br />If anyone in Hollywood is listening... you could do worse than to use the &#34;Renewal&#34; series on Kindle or &#34;The Remaining&#34; series on Kindle. Both would make $ on TV or the big screen.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|One of my top 10 favorite musical journeys of all time.  Paul Simon was a leader in our generation, seeking out new music and new influences, resulting in the enrichment of us all.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this game! We play it weekly with our 9 and 8 year old daughters, who also love it. Great game!!!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Fun!<br />The imagination is certainly stretched with this program.  Really am enjoying it and am happy to get to watch it now.  I wouldn't have been able to wait each week to see what has happened!
B006LSZECO|4.0|While most loved this book until the ending--I loved the whole thing. The ending was anything but predictable. Did it end the way most want? No--but that's what makes it so great!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am really enjoying this series.  Just wonderful.!!  The characters are beautifully played and the stories are very, very good.
B004856SQ8|5.0|Quite possibly one of my most fave movies! It's just fun, entertaining, and great chemistry with the cast! Must buy!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Basically ok. But I work at a big tech company and, well, really unrealistic that peeps would be so excited about their employers' initiatives or that the leaders would be so dogmatic.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love it just don't like when it freezes (low WiFi) and then throws 10 balls at you and 31 bingos go to zero in 1second
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love the game. I just wish it was a little more clear on what to do with the inventory you collect. I also hate waiting to continue when my energy is low.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is GREAT! I LOVE it so much. Great movie kinda intense and sad to but really really really good. I definitely recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game very entertaining<br />Really enjoyed is game makes you use your brain race against a friend see who escapes first
1476727651|5.0|I have been a King follower since the beginning, as a lot of people are.  Saying that, some of his books have started slow and built up the suspense.  This one grabbed me from the start.  The hardest part was putting it down but at 528 pages, I had to take some breaks.  I will never look at those land boats the same again.<br />Only correction I would make to it is the dog's name was \\"spot\\"
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great quality--quick shipping--secure packaging--satisfied with my purchase! Was bought as a gift.  Will be buying other like products in the future.
B00116GHMM|5.0|I am very happy with the album as expected.  The vinyl press us very good.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I saw my sister playing this and soon downloaded it. I had to go on a plane trip of four hours, and at least half of that was spent on this game. Totally worth it.
B00BC5FN2C|4.0|House of Cards is like The West Wing except that characters in House of Cards lack any and all forms of morality. This series is based on the British series of the same name which is in turn based on Shakespeare's Richard III. The story follows Frank Underwood, House Majority Whip, and his quest for power. He is supported by his wife who is just as power hungry as he is. Together they make backroom deals, manipulate the innocent and guilty, and kill people to achieve the end that they want.<br /><br />The show starts of quickly but quickly gets mired in minutia and starts to drag through the second half of the season.The show is easy to binge watch the first couple of episodes, but as the show moves later into the season and it slows down it becomes harder to watch.<br /><br />The blu-ray set contains no additional content. There are no special features, making of..., or cast interviews. This limits the market for the blu-ray set to the people who are huge fans of the show. So, unless you don't subscribe to Netflix or you're a huge fan of the show there is no reason to buy the set over just watching it on Netflix.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I like playing this game because it's a casual game...bit too hard at times but definitely worth playing ...I love seek and finds and pirates ..so it's doubly awesome
147676459X|5.0|I was very much looking forward to this book, ever since I found out she was going to write it. Well, Allie Brosh did not disappoint. What a thoroughly excellent piece of work, amusing, entertaining, laugh out loud funny, and yet there are serious elements that showed great courage on her part to share. It might be helpful to have been exposed to her blog, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary. The work stands on it's own, in this medium. Well done, Allie Brosh. Very well done!
B0015AARJI|1.0|I received a knock-off controller from a 3rd party seller in China. Aside from the tell-tale funky S on the controller, and typos in the fine print on the box, it couldn't hold a charge. I reported to Amazon with no response. When the L3 (click joystick) stopped working, I took it apart and used one of the pieces to fix my original controller.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|This works great as long as you never visit a secure site. You can forget about Facebook, banking or anything else that's encrypted. There's no way to set it to exclude secure domains. Needs work.
0143123173|2.0|I was thrilled when our book club chose this book set in Wyoming. Also, a member suggested that a made for television series portrays Walt Longmire. I started reading the book, and felt that maybe if I watched one of the episodes, I would better understand the book. The series is terrible. The portrayal of Vic, one of the deputies, is miserable. In the novel, Vic is a street-smart cop from Philadelphia. In the television series, Vic is a bumbling idiot. Johnson goes to great lengths to show his literature intelligence by inserting various forgotten authors in Walt Longmire's musings. I felt that Walt is too wordy, and his thoughts too rambling. For a mystery written for Wyoming, the action is tepid and scant. The ending was a surprise, but the rest of the novel dragged.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Very fun for a free app. Works really good and the graphics are great. It keeps me interested for a long time.
0316069485|3.0|I enjoy Connelly, especially the Harry Bosch series. Bosch has a minor part in this novel, the major character being Mickey Haller, Bosch's half brother. Haller is a lawyer and Bosch is a police detective. The story is written in first person, and the narrative becomes confusing, at times. Both Harry and Mickey have a teenage daughter, but Bosch seems the better father. After reading the brilliant Anatomy of a Murder, the courtroom scenes in this novel are tame. Connelly does a good job explaining discovery and courtroom procedure. I am amazed that someone that has been convicted and sent to prison could possibly have the verdict &#34;reversed&#34; and then be set free. Connelly delves into what must be done for the new trial, and hints that our judicial system reigns supreme, but has flaws. An exciting treat to read Connelly, but still prefer Bosch.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|This is the best book ever and will be a great movie.I am definitely going to go see it in theatre!
0316069353|3.0|This is Connelly's Mickey Haller series and I prefer the Harry Bosch series. The two characters are half brothers that work in California: one as a lawyer and one as a police detective. After seeing the movie, The Lincoln Lawyer with Matthew McConaughey, I could imagine Matthew presenting the dialogue in his unique style. The same impression I had with the book and movie, The Anatomy of a Murder with Jimmy Stewart. I am unsure if this reaction is good or bad when the actor becomes the book's character. Connelly presents a vivid accounting of the trial, much like Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent and Robert Traver's Anatomy of a Murder. All three writers expose the tricks of the lawyer to save his client. All three writers end on that cliché of &#34;it's not over until the fat lady sings.&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't want to spoil anything but once you get to the end you'll know. I love this book so much I cried so much at the end
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very very addictive. At this time my complaint is sometimes it stutters then I have to take the battery out in order to do anything on the phone. The stutters also looses that life.
0399226907|4.0|Excellent book for the price, it had a little juice stains on it but cant complain.. I bought it for my kids.
0312330855|5.0|I recently bought these books again after having read them many years ago.  Still loved them...  But I had forgotten how much swearing they contain!  That's the only caveat.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|never played a game like this one on the kindle one of the best games ever and hope more people enjoy the game like me
B00EB9Z9Z2|1.0|I thought it was more clear, not so bad but for me The secret, The power and The magic are more simple to follow.  It was not what I expected.  It doesn't follow the same page as the others books.  I thought it was going to be like the Magic book ..,
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was wrapped up in the story of Will and Louisa. Heartbreaking ending, but overall, very well-written, witty, and humorous novel. You really get a sense of life for quadriplegics and their care takers.
B0036TGT2A|2.0|Did not include the digital copy as advertised or as described on the package.  I am returning for a replacement.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love this game!! It is very addictive. I would play it all the time if I could get out of doing everything else. This game is a must.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I enjoy this game and don't need my glasses to see it :-) also the dragons are adorable and the tilt function is an added bonus. Will definitely be a go to game fir me
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I have a 2.5 yr old son. He loves puzzles and he loves trains and I love having something I can hand him to do if he gets fussy or bored while we are out.  He has no trouble with the early puzzles and it took a little time but he has now mastered all of the puzzles. I even downloaded he app to my kindle fire bc he wanted my phone all the time to play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book!!! I couldn't put it down lol and it look me less than a week to read. Highly recommended this book and can't wait to start the second one.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I loved the first book. The second was still pretty good. This book was just disappointing. The ending was terrible.
B00EOFIYZA|4.0|Love her voice, sounds like it has an Irish lilt. The music is magical, for lack of a better description. Only thing I don't like is her tendency to repeat phrases a bit too much for my taste.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Tris always feels like she has to fix or do something, which is usually to her detriment, very much like her mother. And then the beautiful relationship between her and Tobias. There were some beautiful things going on towards the end of the book, like Tobias reconciliation with his mother; Tris trying to re-conciliate with Caleb, but then the last tenth part of the book is just beyond sad, starting with Uriah's coma, and then I just lost it! I could not believe Tris was dead, and like Christina was hoping there was a mistake. I cried, sobbed and cried again and sobbed again. I wanted Tris to be alive, what an emotional ending. I never realize how much  in love I have been with this character, Tris, until accepting that she has died. This is the very best of the series. Tris was smart, perceptive, beautiful, compassionate, loving character.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is so much fun. Hunting,  upgrading and shooting all wrapped in one game. I can spend hours playing and not have to clean any game! This game rocks. Thank you for such a great free game.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|It states HD but it did not look like HD. I cannot use my stereo receiver. If there is a way to use my stereo I want to know how,
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This is a great book from a different venue than I usually choose to read.  It is a little disconnected and sometimes hard to follow but very heartrending.  There are some happy moments but mostly a sad reality of a very difficult period of time.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|watched part one and wanted to see part 2 when it came out and it was worth the wait. great
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Never play this game at night it's creepy and i love the game you will love it to they give you what to do you battle a sorceress with a ring there are puzzles even  it's the best
B007HIEBV2|5.0|Amazing album.  Great musicianship and killer energy.  I recommend this to anyone who likes swing, rockabilly and the like.  Also great for dancing
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Excellent CD that expands the range we have heard from Jonathan and Charlotte.  For the few who don't know this cross-over duo, view their original audition with Britain's Got Talent on Youtube.  One site has 42 million hits and there other sites showing it too.<br /><br />Less operatic than their first CD &#34;Together&#34; except for two solos by Jonathan who demonstrates he would be right at home on the operatic stage.  His wonderful tenor voice must be one of the very best in the world right now.<br />Charlotte continues to improve.  Rather to my surprise her solo rendition of &#34;Wishing you were somehow home again&#34; turned out to be one of my favorites on the disc.  I compares well with the famous version by Sarah Brightman.  I like the purity and unstrained sound of her non operatic voice on the high notes.<br /><br />They are most magical when singing together though.  They bring a beautiful new approach to &#34;Endless Love,&#34; &#34;You've got the love&#34; and of course &#34;Arms of an angel.&#34;  Marvelous duets well worth the price of the CD alone.
B000SE0OYA|4.0|Changed this and it definitely increased the print quality.  If you are getting streaks on your pages, I'd recommend changing this out.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown is the M. Night Shymalan of books. Started great, then tried to rehash the same storytelling and setting repeatedly and blindly clearly with the intention of milking his Italian research and initial storytelling novelty. I have read almost all his books with decreasing interest, and finally with Lost Symbol, I couldn't bring myself to get through half the book, and ended up wikiing the trainwreck of a storyline.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I enjoy this game. Fun game play. Excellent free app of the day. Thanks app store. I have a similar game that I paid
1476727651|5.0|King has written another brilliant book in the following installment of “The Shining.”  Doctor Sleep intertwines three stories. First, Danny Terrance coming to grips of his situation after the tragic events of the hotel while battling his demons.  Second, Abra who is a young girl and she has an even greater use of the shining. Third, we are introduced to the True Know. They are semi-immortal beings who prey on children who possess the shining. They torture to capture their “steam” and they are able to live a long time.<br /><br />In this book, it was great to see King developing Danny’s gift and his struggles. I could relate to the ever consuming desire to drink and Danny becoming sober due to things he did to suppress his gift. Danny goes through some terrible times but we see him growing into a mature individual who helps dying individuals go to the other side.<br /><br />Another element that I enjoyed was the shining used by the characters. It is described as premonitions, mind-reading, and the ability to be inside a person’s mind. I loved the struggle Abra and Dan had with the Rosie the Hat. I also liked the traps that Abra set and her, even though a young girl, being developed by Dan just like he was mentored.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, I recommend this page turner for anybody.<br /><br />9.85 / 10
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This game is just like all the other flow games out there. It's fun, simple, and a pretty decent way to pass time. Although I hope the  levels get harder.. I beat the first 21 levels in like 10 minutes. Lol  I give it 4/5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game ever. graphics are amazing. I love this game so much. I made a mistake deleting it from my kindle but then I got it back cause its so good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|hi, I love this game, it is very fun and it loads fast too! I would recommend this game for sure!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Sweet game wish it was easy to get better characters u want an event characters other than its pretty nice good graphics
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app it keeps me up to date on my exact power level, so I don't have to guess!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I have this for my Ipod and it is updated more so can you update Hill Climb Racing it has the hover craft and the roller coaster it also has beach and roller coaster.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game I'm hooked for life!I wake up out of my sleep to play. Hooked on this like a crack head
B008M721MS|3.0|It usually works very well for me, but sometimes the video quality is very poor an Skype always stops. I have to delete it then download it again. It's a pain.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome. I play with my friends and its a great time waster for those days where you are bored out of your mind
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book really touched my heart.<br />Katniss is brave as always.<br />The twist ending was good too!<br /> I really enjoyed and loved this book.
B004HMNQQM|5.0|great classic great cast great concept because it could really happen Jodi and Richard were great together what else is there
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I play this game I love it. But my game is glitch out and its not on tract. But it's awesome.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|loved this move never gets old could watch it over and over and never get tired of it still laugh and cry
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Movie was better than I had expected, I enjoyed every moment of it. Ready for the next installment of the Avengers.
B000NDMRDW|5.0|loved it one of my fav movies never get tired of watching it have watched it at least a hundred times
B00000IMTH|5.0|Classic Rainbow, it does not get much better than this for classic rock n roll. I listen to this often.
B00F91H666|5.0|loved it what a concept ! make u wonder what if? you know some chemical turning us into zombies wow!
8866137979|5.0|How could anything be less than perfect given HOBBIT, lovely brown color, Smaug the dragon and... well, you get the idea. Moleskine has done it again with a tremendous special edition... I think I have them all now!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|who don't like iron man hes great and I want a suit like that not for me but for my man and I love Robert Downey jr
B00GII9UCW|5.0|I knew I had to get this album from the moment I heard the first cut on Norah's website, even though I thought it was an odd team-up. If you've heard the Everly Brothers &#34;Songs our Daddy Taught Us&#34;, then you already are familiar with this album. Billy Joe and Norah don't stray far from the source material. Hearing the two of them harmonizing on these twos gives a different vibe from the original that is very enjoyable.
0780622650|5.0|love it because i use to watch this when i was little in 1999 and i like it and it was in good condition
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|It was a realistic depiction of a person in denial about himself.  Well acted.  Good script.  Worth watching unless you have a fear of flying.
B00B52F278|5.0|This entire show and absolutely everything about it is perfect. Spartacus is absolutely, hand down, the most wonderful show that has ever aired on any network. Period. Although the blood and sex is intense, it has a deeper story with characters you grow to love and feel for. This is an epic season because Liam McIntyre proves he is not just 2nd best to our beloved Andy Whitfield, but he IS Spartacus.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love playing this with my five year old granddaughter in the evenings. Sometimes she finds items faster than I can. Can't wait to play. Love it!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Attractive, nice features. Simple interface. But there's no way to STOP it from running constantly once it's installed! Might be nice app for human life, but it doesn't play nice with your battery life.  I'd return it if I could for one simple reason: IT KILLS YOUR BATTERY LIFE!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game. It is cool. You can run and hop from train to train. It's kinda like temple run!!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Given the backstory of this album, it's really quite good. I usually only listen to Christian music, there's some junk lyrics on here, but the music is good enough I think it's still good enough to really enjoy.
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|Reasonable game compared to Real Racing 3 where the in-app purchases are a little overboard. GT Racing 2 still has a ton on in-app purchases but don't seem nearly as onerous. Technically this is a gorgeous game on my Kindle FIre HDX. Graphics are amazing for what can be done on a tablet these days.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|An excellent, well written history of President Lincoln and his cabinet.  I discovered many news facts of their day-to-day lives during the Civil War I did not know.  Their strengths and humanity I now understand.  Well worth your time to read.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It is what it is. I don't like the app or the company. I do however love my friends across multiple continents and enjoy being able to keep in touch with them.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Love this classic Christmas story. Cannot go wrong buying this to watch during the holiday season. May be a little scary for little ones, but my 3.5 year old loves it, overall.
0545265355|4.0|My niece got these as a gift and enjoyed each one very much<br />I guess its good reading<br />glad to have gotten it for her
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Terrible playback - sound cut out every 30 seconds. I love Amazon but I think this one is on them... wish I had my money back vs. watching a movie that skips every few seconds... guess I'll buy from cable provider in the future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun. Sometimes it gets frustrating, but I still keep playing! Definitely a kid and adult friendly game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great free app. Good way to unwind and keep my mind exercised. easy to use and I win often enough to keep my interest.
1616550414|5.0|Finally a book that showcases all that the Zelda franchise has ever been, and it's been compiled neatly in one beautiful hard bound embossed book.  You get all the facts on each major game as well as the chronology of said games, something that has always been debated.  And while some might argue that it ruins and limits the series to do so, it's great to finally see how Nintendo and Miyamoto had envisioned this great series to unfold.  A must have for every Zelda fan out there, and a great companion piece to the Prima Games strategy guide Collector's box set.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book was easy to read and I love the way the author writes.  It was a very good story.
B00000K3D4|5.0|One of my absolute, all-time favorite childhood movies -- it's an instant classic -- David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly are absolutely amazing and it's such a great tale of adventure and childhood. Sarah is instantly sympathetic as the misunderstood teenager, and David Bowie is dangerous and delicious in his uber tight pants. The music is amazing thanks to Bowie's too-beautiful-for-words-to-describe voice, and Jim Henson's imagination and puppets are absolutely perfect. I could watch this movie over and over again, and I absolutely intend to indoctrinate any children I may have with this movie. I LOVE this movie!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The story was very interesting  and easy to read. I would love to read more books by this author.  Love it
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Kindle fire HD 7&#34;<br />Played it right away.<br />Nice graphics. Nice interface. Hints if you want them.<br />Many puzzles. You won't get caught in a dead end if you make mistakes.<br />The up side is it's great fun, and well done all around.<br />The down side is that it goes quickly.<br />One person at a time, then reset for the next player.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|Very good story, love the way the author writes.  Also read the Book Thief and enjoyed that book as well.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Dvd came promptly and in great condition. Saw this movie when it first came out and loved it! Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did not disappoint as usual, and the fact that Johnny can really sing in this is refreshing. But my favorite star was newcomer Jamie Campbell Bower, whose rendition of Anthony was sweet and heartfelt, just as it should be.
020530902X|1.0|I despise this book. It was written by Strunk near the beginning of the 20th century, then revised and expanded by his former student, White, starting in mid-century. It has probably led to more grammatical errors by writers at all levels of literary skill, from the most admired masters to the most rudimentary hacks, than any other language guide has or possibly could. It is the devil's work.<br /><br />But how can this be? Everyone knows that Strunk & White is the ultimate authority on the (extremely) limited number of grammar and style issues that it addresses. The fact is that Strunk & White is the Kim Kardashian of language manuals: It is famous because it is famous. Also, E.B. White wrote Charlotte's Web. Who doesn't love Charlotte's Web?<br /><br />The advice in Strunk & White is delivered with a supercilious sneer. The language is stiff, and the rules espoused are often incomprehensible and just as often plain wrong. Yet my college sociology professor assigned the book in 1980 as the gold-standard language reference when writing papers for his class. Twenty years later, Stephen King just as emphatically recommended the book in his guide on writing.<br /><br />A few years ago, on the 50th anniversary of the publication of Strunk & White, the New York Times asked five grammarians their opinion of the book. The clear consensus was that for broad stylistic questions, Strunk & White was an adequate authority: Use the active voice, employ strong verbs, etc. But as a grammar text, nah, it was useless; worse, dangerous. Neither Strunk nor White were authorities, and their book perfectly reflects their lack of expertise. [...]<br /><br />Still, who doesn't love Charlotte's Web?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Getting tired of the dystopian romances.. This particular story is extremely violent as well. I liked the first book, but lost my taste for EVERYONE getting killed by the second.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Just the best production of Les Miz ever!  I saw it at movies and came straight home to buy the CD so I can watch whenever I want.  Everyone in cast is splendid except Russel Crowe is lacking as a singer but an excellent actor.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love this series.  The stories are well written, the characters are interesting and the acting is great.  A great way to just relax and enjoy away from all the stresses of life.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Game is really fun to play on my Kindle fire. Great graphics and controls. Thank you for a great game.
B00000J2PH|5.0|A classic and still a favorite.  This is a replacement for my original album, which is worn out from so much play time.
B00338QELU|5.0|I love Henning Mankell's writing. I have read several of his books and have enjoyed them all. I tend to compare all other writers to him and not many can come up to his standards, in my opinion. I love his books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|reread the book again after close to 15 years. Even better to an older more mature mind. Absolutely no criticism. There is a reason why this book is so revered.
0679809015|5.0|My daughter received two of these books at her first birthday party. I'm glad I kept both because it looks like we will be wearing the flaps out of the first one very soon. My daughter brings this book to me several times a day to read with her. It is so fun making the animal sounds with her and she squeals in delight when she finds the animal behind the flap. This book is a perfect size for small hands and I recommend it for babies/toddlers.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Great film.  Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorites and shows why.  Thor is an excellent fantasy adventure movie that remained within the realm of my imagination!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Really fascinating. Unlike anything else. The modern totalitarian regime and its mechanics of death, described vividly enough, but with a touch of magic realism in the story to make it go down a bit easier.  Four stars instead of five because it's a bit padded and lacks some central drama. Well worth reading. But ultimately depressing. How can the people who gave this a Pulitzer continue to support Obama and his statist policies...is one question the book raised chez moi.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good book all-in-all but is slow in the middle. Strong finish. Would recommend to all Grisham lovers. As with all Grisham novels, the book flows very well and is an easy read.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|I think it was ok but after you play it for about ten minutes it feted really boating so I insist you don't get it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I downloaded after seeing my friend play it and it is a Great game!!! Enjoying playing it during my free time and I enjoy the battles with the heroes and villains
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love these kind of games. I like the challenge in the searches. Sometimes its a bit hard to find items.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|this movie changes everything I thought I knew about SeaWorld and the &#34;bond&#34; between whale and trainer. I can't believe the curtain that SeaWorld has pulled over all of our eyes. this is a must see for anyone who cares about these extremely intelligent animals. Keeping them in a tank is barbaric.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This story is perfection, it is terrifying, and unyielding at times but heartwarming and smile inducing, at others. Unlike Big Bill and his friends I'm sure you will never forget It.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I'm not even able to download this! Y U NO WURK!!!!<br />I MEAN SERIOUSLY! DONT BOTHER TO DOWNLOAD IT! OH CRAP WHY IS CAPS LOCK ON
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|An awesome book full of 80s pop culture references.  A great book for science fiction and fantasy lovers.  Highly recommended.
B00E4A830G|5.0|In this latest Harry Bosch story, Harry is still working in the unsolved cold case unit. He is assigned to investigate  the death of a young Danish journalist who died 20 years earlier during the LA riots. He has very little to go on but with great detective skills comes to an answer. Once again he has internal investigations on his heels so must be careful.<br />As with all this series by Michael Connelly the characters are real. The story is totally absorbing and in places very scarey. A book that's hard to put down and I loved it
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I have wore out a lot of games on my kindle this one is new too me and to be ho.best it's a lot of fun wish I could have more tries though<br />..good job though add me people blah blah blah
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|I have always loved Billie Joe, and I enjoy Norah Jones. I knew they would be good together. But I didn't expect it to be this great.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I had low expectations for this series going in, but I have thoroughly enjoyed it. The story has similarities to both Harry Potter and Twilight, but it's original at the same time. Very entertaining.
B000FC1D0O|5.0|Timeless wisdom from ancient Rome useful for the post-modern world, this is a great evening read or end of the work day book to clear the mind & refresh the senses.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Made me laugh out loud as well as appreciate the work and dedication of Tina Fey as someone who really did it &#34;her way&#34;!!!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Classic American literature from an American icon in literature, great from middle school to middle age. The story of these two friends and their challenging predicaments offer an enduring moral lesson.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is a great time waster. I only wish I didn't have to ask for Facebook help or pay for extra moves.  Paid the .99 and felt like it wasn't worth it.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|This is a very good headset it sounds great very clear and good the headset it self is very well built but the receiver that you hook up to the optical port on the ps4 seams  a little bit lite a and cheap but it works and it works well.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Love,love,LOVE this album!!! Just about all of my fav songs from the show (john the revelator has got to be one of the best songs ever)! Could not have had a better Vol 1 song compilation for an AWESOME show! I will defenitly be buying all the rest of the song comps!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For me, one of the best Stephen King novels, second only to &#34;The Stand&#34;, and I've read all of his books and short stories.  Honestly, there isn't anything about this book I can pick on.  Just read it... you won't be sorry!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesome app that allows you to challenge your thinking. Some rooms are a bit more challenging than others but keep clicking around to figure out what you need to get done
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I own all three Fire Maple point and click adventures.  Each has built on the success of the on going before it.  The puzzles are fun and not ridiculous.  The stories piece together well.  The map and hint system is well done.<br />While not as in depth or long as a Myst game, fans of Myst will really enjoy the adventure in Mosaika.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A little confusing but free so its not that big of a deal.  I'm doing this for free gems.  I wish you could choose your first horse.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought my first Lego's in 1978.  They are still in perfect shape waiting on my son to be old enough to play with.  In the mean time,my middle daughter has taken up Lego Friends.  These block are as durable as the ones I remember.  This set took about 1 hours for my 9 year old to put together and has enough other suggested configurations that she is still experimenting with ways to integrate with her other Lego's.<br />Remember Lego's are as much as investment as they are fun, because they will be there for your grandchildren and their children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever really you should get this game it's AWESOME<br />I could play this all day
0762777931|5.0|This excellent book should have been called Nutition 101. It's not another diet book. It truly is a guide for how to live and eat the rest of your life. The information is presented in a memorable way. There are lots of pictures. The layout resembles a magazine almost. This is a staple for any health conscious individual. If you want to live and eat cleaner you will be thankful for this book.
B003V1WTMM|1.0|Repetitive description to the point of idiotic,  after a few chapters my only thought  was &#34;who cares&#34;.  I was lent this book and will gladly give it back unfinished.  Plan to pass on this author.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This book was like an emotional roller coaster and I couldn't put the book down. I love the ending and I especially love how Apollo kept his promise!! I guess my favorite thing about this book or series are the characters. They were so alive and  full of unique personalities. I just love Alex's snarkiness and smart comments. The ending was  perfect. Aiden and Alex belong together.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! I didnt know what it was until I decided to give it a chance and I'm hocked!!!!
B00270WH3Y|4.0|A great selection of many of their long-time hits. Only wish it had more live concerts so we could re-live the memories.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Great game for the times when you just need to have a few quiet moments to chill. Each grid can be played very quickly so you can choose how much time you want to spend. It's an easy game to pick up or put down.  As a free ap, it's a no-brainer! I have the Neon Free as well.  Colors are better in that version but you can choose different grid sizes, etc in this one so it balances out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was very sad to read the end of this series, but Suzanne Collins did not disappoint!  I will have a massive book hangover after finishing this!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Gameloft is the best game company it has all the good games. But this game is the best out of all of them. You should get this game!
1400096936|2.0|This book is alright but I do not find it as great as others do. I thought it went from one cliché character to another.There is a lot better research he could have done that would give his story a lot more credence. Starting with even the Spanish slang used in the northern part of Mexico. For 50 bucks someone could have corrected it. Also the events in History...I mean if he is trying to have his novel be as real as possible. The historical facts on the events he mentions are wrong. I did not find the style of writing great either.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm so in love with this trilogy!  I wish it didn't have to end.  I read all three books twice and it never gets boring!  I just wish there was more of Christian's voice in the book.  Anyways I love the books so much and I'm so excited for the movie!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Would be a five-star game if it didn't need money for all the bonuses.  I would gladly pay for the game instead of giving nickels and dimes every time I reach a new level.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I've read it a few times now & love it more every time. Characters that take you back in time & keep you turning pages until the alarm clock goes off in the morning!
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin has always been one of my favorite Disney movies!  I am happy to say that it is now one of my daughter's favorites as well.  It is a classic!  Disney at its best.  I recommend it without reservation.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|I rented this for my grandchildren. It was entertaining and had good animation! As a creationist the story line was expected but annoying. Children would miss many of the allusions while some adults (unlike myself) would applaud them. My true rating would be two and a half stars, but I tend to round up.
0385335989|5.0|I have read almost all of her books. I like the historical detail, and I love the strength and integrity of her main characters, especially Claire. All the historically based adventure and the interlinking love stories make a very satisfying read. Not quick reads, the books are huge, but they leave me wanting more and dreading the end of the last book.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|DVDs arrived quickly, in excellent condition. I am very pleased! The series is addicting because it is so well written and performed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is more than a good read-- it is a challenge to the preconceptions of the human mind. What is true humanity and does it mean anything in the broadest spectrum? Is there a place for religion in a world defined by continuous scientific advance? Is manipulation of weaker minds necessary for the survival and success of the human race? Card asks questions the rest are afraid to. Excellent in every way. Read with your mind open and enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's about time this is available for the Kindle, however it's a little too late as my obsession with this game is dwindling!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|You've played this game before a thousand times. But, at least it works without any glitches or things like that. 3 stars for being more of the same without being broken.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|really informative and interesting regarding training of seals. very inspirational story of survival. easy to read and riveting. would love to read more by the same author.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Is this for children? looks like a cute little furry animal, however it is disgusting.  I deleted it right after I tried it out.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Have read all the hunger games series and loved them both. Seen both movies and can't wait for the final
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game it is fun great to kill time,it is realist and a good time I love it and will keep playing it
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I didn't realize that I had to buy coins everytime this game was play. So it hasn't been played. I thought it would give them something to do while they were here on vacation.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Very believable.  As always, Mr. Washington shine in the role.  Not overly long.  The action parts where well done. I would watch again.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|One heck of a funny movie and is a great addition if you love comedies. Definitely a must have !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OH MY GOD! I don't know how to explain this book. It is so amazing. I literally cried I didn't want it to end. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|I enjoy DC Comics as well as Marvel superheroes and this was one that didn't disappoint. If you like Superman it will be nice for your superhero movie collection.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing. Every single season of this show is a masterpiece. I could go on and on and talk about every detail of the show but its best if you just experience it yourself. Watch the show, you will not regret it. (unless you don't like getting scared)
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Kind of a comedic version of Glee, but just funnier. Another nice addition to a comedy collection if you enjoy music.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its about time.  Been waiting for this game.  Amazon thank you for this game.  Love it!  Be prepared you will be addicted.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Really enjoy horror movies and this ranks up there on my best list. It will most likely make you jump!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well written.  Excellent acting.  Wonderful sets.  I am glad I finally took the time to watch it while my son was in the hospital!
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I love Duolingo! It is the best app ever for learning other languages. After just a few hours on Duolingo, I already knew so many new Spanish words! Someone said something in Spanish in the restraunt I was eating in, and I understood! And I've only had Duolingo for a few days! I would have given it 5 stars but when I was learning verbs, it assumed I knew a word but i didn't so I kept missing it. That is why I subracted 1 star. But other than that, this app is amazing. Keep up the good work Duolingo! &iexcl;Adios!
039916409X|5.0|I've already started reading this book and have already started making shifts and having plenty of &#34;Ah-ha!&#34; moments! Thank you!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game offers great entertainment and fun for the whole family! Also a great learning tool for objects in every day life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It has been a long time since I've read a book that I did not want to end. The character development and intertwined story lines kept me captivated through the entire book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing it.  I do not like running out of lives.  There should be a longer time limit to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's like Blitz but better! You go to each level and it gets harder and that's good because if it's easy then I would get bored. Now get off the reviews and buy Candy Crush Saga!  Love it!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This app is great! Really makes you use your brain fun and does not need intent so much fun not a waist of 99 cents
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game! It has new robots that are super cool. You can change the color of your robot. I love the game and the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome! Hope there's more! Looking forward to the next room and puzzles! Reminds me a bit about the old Must game on the PC.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game is awesome! It has pretty good graphics. This game has alot of stages so this game can last forever. The only thing that I don't like is that you have to wait a while to load. other than that its a good game.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A bestseller in my opinion but it is very deep for some! Great 3D graphics and great different sided stories!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Candy crush sucks 4 adults great 4 kids the time limit is just what they need but 4adults , it blows.<br />Make an adult version greatest game on the planet however it is not 4adults
1250006341|5.0|Downton Abbey! An all time favorite and a great item to pass on to loved ones! I already preordered next one!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This author is good at constructing contexts that allow readers to construct a more complex and integrated picture of Jesus than the usual stick figure, virtually, again crucified, and laboring under some latter day, fatuous theological construct, lost in some hell hole that Dante provided, in anticipation, and resurrecting many years hence himself. Further, Aslan provide a convenient and useful time capsule of the time, a summary that puts Jesus in a more flesh and blood situ than those accumulated dust dirty stale politico-theo mendacities, stretching from J's time to ours, do. And Aslan manages to do this with brisk page turning aplomb .  I like that Aslan seems to expose the the &#34;Christifers&#34; of J as switch-and-bait artists trading on a historically protracted and transcultural &#34;illiteracy&#34; problem of highly literate readers who have big reading problems.  A similar book probably could be written on the theo reconstruction of Islam's prophet.
B002TKFEZK|5.0|Best book describing what's in store for the U.S, and all other countries following the big debt trail.  A classic
B008JFUO72|4.0|The story line is a bit of an old one used many times but the action is good and the special affects amazing and since we love this series.  Hopefully on the next one they'll use a little more imagination on the story line.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Jennifer Aniston is still so HOT ! ! Not as good as Anchoman & Wedding Crashers which are funny every time I see them. I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching. Overall, very funny and very much worth seeing a few times at least. I give it a B+.
B00F880BWG|5.0|An amazing series that captures the horror of 'what if'. The earlier years are better. Some episodes are much like soap operas, but it still gets to me. The special effects are excellent and the characters are well-developed.
B003VCD58I|5.0|I like Maria Gadu very much and this CD is excellent. Great songs and I would recommend all Gadu's CDs.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|By virtue of chance that I had been in search of a book to read that not only kept me wanting more, but also delved into my personal love for things legendary and mythical, a friend who I was on vacation with recommended the series to me. After reading this first book I cannot wait to read the other books and plan to purchase them as soon as I finish this review.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Seriously, as a Shakespeare lover and a sci-fi geek, how could it get any better, Josh Whedon and the bard?!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros:<br />Makes it easy to view youtube and music on the TV<br />responsive<br />high definition<br />can control it from every device<br />Price (compared to a WiDi adapter or a Roku Box)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slow desktop casting
B000GOWNPU|4.0|Gripping intense storyline of four teens sent to a reformatory and the abuse that they endured while there. Years later the abuse was avenged.
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|Way cheaper then in local stores! My son has been obsessed with what he calls &#34;real life&#34; Star Wars. They want like 80+$ for this at local stores. Was so happy I found this on amazon! Going to have a happy little boy on Christmas Day!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great Product. Only thing lacking right now is apps that will work with chromecast, however more should be coming in December according to the latest reports I have read. You tube works great and streaming movies are no problem.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This was great movie watching...my husband enjoyed watching this action packed thriller..would watch it again ....even my great-grandson (4) loved it was glued to the movie...
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play it all the time and like it because because it is challenging and fun to play, and it was free.
B008602KQI|5.0|Fantastic! The rich storyline is thought provoking and entertaining. The movie brings brings the book to life in a way that transcends the darkness of the plot.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love your games enjoy finding all the pieces just neednto earn more energy in the games other than that great for your mind searching for things
B0000062FJ|4.0|Not as polished as its follow-up 'Abraxas', I had it in my vinyl collection but did not rate it as highly as later albums (up to 'Caravanasari'). But I recently bought the CD (flea market) and again admired the cover-the snarling man-lion in black and white, glazed eyes-must have just heard 'Evil Ways' for the first time. And that is the rub with this album, it is good with 'Evil Ways' and 'Soul Sacrifice' the atnd outs. Still powerful, writhing songs with the ability to engage; demonstrating how unique and talented this emerging band was. But it also has a dud in 'You Just Don't Care' and some space filler 'Jin-Go-Lo-Ba' for example that is listenable but it is not consistent. Yes, this is the material driving the Woodstock appaearance and it was rock cross-over (latino and psychadelic rock and a seriously good guitarist in one Carlos Santana. I was pleased to be re-acquainted with it after forty years.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can you upgrade creative mode like make Tnt explode and chest open to put stuff in it.Also make it were u can change creative into the other mode just like the minevraft on the computer.
B000025RHI|4.0|This is a reggae milestone album. The 1977 album was a favourite of many reggae fans on release and like much of the roots/dub material on release from then it requires a fat sound system to get the full feel. So the CD release on VP Records suffers from the transition to this form of recording. It does sound flatter, which given the material is a minus for sound quality. Muting the likes of Ernest Raglin (guitar) , Sly Dunbar on drums and Boris Gardener on bass is going to lessen the impact and does. To make matters worse where is Keith Sterling's piano-buried so deep as to be hard to engage. However, listening to the tracks they retain their individuality, and the loss of the backing only serves to showcase Cedric Myton and Roy Johnson's vocals. And these make the Congos sound unique from other reggae of the times. Sweet as the melodians but with more edge and experimentation (thank you Scratch Perry!) It will do me fine until I can track a better recording or find a vinyl copy to replace the one which was lost so long ago.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very good hunting game but be frugal with your money and gold you will need it for better weapons. Can be addictive though!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I enjoy Death as the narrator. Some humor, irony, etc. on a very difficult topic. Well written .  Great character. You can see them.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a cute game, easy for any age. Little time consuming. The crowns aren't hard to come by either.
1594746036|5.0|epic read absolutely love this book!! I would say that everyone should read this novel, you'll be hooked from the first page
B004IYISSK|5.0|loved everything about this story and it was even better than the movie definitely a must read already downloaded more of her books
0767805712|4.0|The movie was dark. Had you on the edge of your seat a lot of the times. Great plot line! Character development was perfect. Had a great twist at the end of the movie.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Not that great. I bought this product to try and assimilate the Xbox 360 controller on the PS3 and to make the transition from XBOX to Playstation easier. But in the end I just preferred the PS3 controller to this and I got used to using the PS3 controller. I didn't like the analog sticks and the buttons felt cheap. I don't use this controller anymore and it was a waste of money.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This case rules. Plain and simple. Cover is solid, base is solid, hinge point has taken trucker style abuse without fail. Saves wear and tear on the headset itself. We used to accidentally tear the ear buds off in pockets and other places. Buy this and then throw out the mag charge connector that comes with the headset.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book helps to positively discipline your thinking! My sisters and I have been reading the chapters together and applying the exercises. This is an easy read and you'll enjoy the writing style!
081099741X|5.0|I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan so it was a no-brainer for me to pick this book up. I don't think I could have hoped for a more detailed and beautiful book than this. It's big and hefty, but it's full of great photography and behind the scenes. The only downside to this book is the binding is a little wonky and makes it sit uneven. That's not enough to deter me and shouldn't deter anyone else from getting this. Fans and casual readers alike will love this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Perfect way to improve your touch screen skills while being totally amused.  fun yet simple with increasing levels of skill required.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Fun game. No problems so far with software. Love that I can play without having to wait for &quot;lives&quot; to be earned.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It starts out simple and gets more challenging with each level. I enjoy solving the different puzzles they keep it fun.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Love anything by Loreena McKennitt.  The songs are mystical and so is her voice.  A very talented lady.  Buy it@
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|I love scary movies but feel in recent years there has not been a good one.There is no original story lines and every scary movie in recent years looks the same.I cant remember the last time I have had a good scary movie keep me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />All I heard is how this is not only one of the scariest movies of all time but maybe the best since the Exorcist.I heard from my friends and read reviews on how this is one of the scariest movies of all time.<br /><br />Well people need to get out of the house more often.I have seen way scarier movies then these piece of garbage and I get more scared on things like Ghost Adventures.I heard the first 30 minutes of the movie is the scariest.<br /><br />Whatever.Took like almost a hour to even to get a somewhat of a scary scene.<br /><br />I dont how even anybody can compare this movie as good as the Exorcist.Not even on the same planet.I am glad I got to see this movie for free thru my cable company.This is by far the worst scary movie of all time.The only thing scary about this movie is if they even consider a part 2.<br /><br />This is the most overrated and overhyped movie of all time.Not one time did I jump out of my seat or get goosebumps.Normally after I watch a good scary movie,I am the type of person that will look around the house and corners and kinda watch things at the corner of my eye.Not one time on this movie.<br /><br />This movie might have had a shot if they did it years ago like around the time of the Exorcist or even it the 90's.But after all these years with movies like The Ring,Exorcism of Emily Rose,The Shining,It,etc.,there was really no point.Especially after the Ring.All of the scary movies over the past decade have been pretty much the same story line.<br /><br />And if you like a good slasher movie,this is not it(which is funny.I have heard so many complaints that it is not a slasher movie.I did not get that feeling from the previews).<br /><br />I just cant believe that this moviehas gotten so many positive reviews and everyone talking about how scary it is.I have gotten more scares out of American Horror Story then this crap.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Another beautiful cd by Loreena McKennitt.  She is so talented and her voice is magical.  My favourite song is The Parting Glass.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This is great.  I don't play, but this helps for choir rehearsals and getting the correct notes.  The labeled keys are a much needed feature!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Love Robert Duvall.  Loved this story and the book as well as the movie.  Beautiful country.  Superb acting.  Buy it!
0316055433|5.0|This is a new author for me, but I couldn't put this book down. It is so well written, I would recommend it to anyone or group who appreciates good literature. I didn't want the novel to end; I learned a lot from this book because it had characters who revealed a reality that I was not at all familiar with. None the less the protagonist was amazing throughout the novel.
072325804X|5.0|Bought this for my niece who is expecting a baby girl in Febuary.  The illustrations are beautiful and I think that she will enjoy it for many years to come!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I think that the cool part about this game is that you can choose your mode you want to play in. Easy,normal,etc. Another thing I lake about this game that makes it so good is the graphics, the creators make it seem like your in the game!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Wonderful story about righting wrongs. Hint of Mystery, intrigue & honor. Loved it! Fantastic read !yada yada yada yada. Fantastic
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|Bought it at Wal-Mart, wont even charge. What a piece of junk. If I could even get it to charge it would probably destroy my thumbs in the process.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great Movie, pricing, packings from Amazon.  Super fast shipping with Amazon Prime.  Watched it when it was released in theaters.  Bought it for my movie collection to watch it on my own big screen movie room.  Blu Ray with extra features are awesome for fans like me!!
B0068RHGJM|5.0|This album is amazing! The range of style, the depth of the music, it is amoung some of Nightwish's best work. The album is heavy metal, certainly, but there is also a bluesy track, a folksy track, and middle eastern inspired elements to their work. I could seriously listen to the album for days without growing bored.<br /><br />If you like Nightwish and enjoy when artists evolve their sound, you'll definitely love this album.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The acting is superb; the plot is intriguing; it is very entertaining and I love that I can stream it, without commercials.  Definitely portrays the legal system and the temptations of working in it quite well.  Love the descriptions of the wealthy wives.
B00BC254I8|5.0|This book is great never has anyone looked so deep inside of themselves and revealed such inner dark feelings. The stories are highly entertaining and the insight of the life a international celebrity is priceless.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This series is very entertaining, juxtaposing a cowboy mentality with space travel hundreds of years from now.  The good guys are good, and at least one bad guy gains redemption...
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I saw the video on there it is cool game well not that much as I play it  the game it's cool game on earth I play it when I sleep at 2:00 in the morning  and 1:00 in the morning even 5:00 in the morning too!!
B004D23BRU|4.0|Kids loved it.  Watched it over and over.  A little more dark and &#34;Russian&#34; than I was expecting.  Music was familiar, but abbreviated. Lot of artistic license from original.  I had to watch a couple times to catch the subtleties.  Watch with your kids because they will have lots of questions.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Downey does a great job re-doing the classic Sherlock in a movie - bought to go with the other movie Game of Shadow
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The Goldfinch/ good writing gone astray<br /><br />Beginning is excellent, but it becomes far too repetitious, particularly in the drug scenes, which recur with some constancy.  Too bad, though, since you never understand why such a sensitive boy/man with a mother who obviously had a great influence on him could become such a rotter.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|did not solve problem. kindle keyboard will still not power on. amber light goes off at 5-10sec.nothing works ,still locked up
B0064W63D6|5.0|Neil Gaimen is an awesome writer of fantasy worlds and the world we think we live in. Read anything by him. Even if its a grocery list. You won't be disappointed.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book is really well written.  I wish it would have ended differently, but still enjoyable. I will read other novels by this author.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Just do.Easy and reliable and hard working. Makes you feel safe and not have to worry too much about the device
B0090SI582|3.0|I have to admit it, after reflection I was a little disappointed in 'The Wolverine'. Oh, it's nicely done and with some great special effects and action sequences, and I certainly don't expect a multi-layered, Oscar-worthy script with heavy character development when going into a film like this one. And yet, I've enjoyed past 'X-Men' films for this reason; that I grew to know and like the main characters, even if the bad guys sometimes came off as cartoonish.<br /><br />Here, it's all sort of cartoonish. A good film, but Wolverine - who spends a great deal of the film mourning (and dreaming about) the loss of his beloved Jean Grey, is brooding and dark and fairly depressing throughout. And the plot - Wolverine, a recluse living in the woods after all that is happened, is summoned to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend he saved during the Nagasaki bombing in World War II - is a bit both superficial and artificial, with a subplot involving the friend's granddaughter that gets Wolverine into all kinds of mess with both the Yakuza and a serpent-tongued (literally) mutant who has found a way to render Wolvering all but mortal.<br /><br />NOT a bad film ... but with little substance, many cartoon characters for characters, a script that needed a couple more rewrites, and an unnecessary romantic subplot for Wolverine that goes nowhere. On the plus side, it has Hugh Jackman, great visuals, a pretty wicked \\"final battle\\" ending, Will Yun Lee, and the film's best asset beyond Jackman - Rila Fukushima, who is totally kick-ass as Yukio (also the fight/chase scene that starts at the funeral and ends on a bullet train - that, and Fukushima, are worth seeing the film for ALONE).
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story provides a continUous opportunity for stretching one's imagination and yet the whole tale has a quality of beliEvability
B008JFUN6E|3.0|ELYSIUM takes place in the year 2154, on an Earth that has all but died out due to war, disease, overpopulation, etc. - when the film opens, the entire planet looks like Beirut on a really, really bad day. By now there are only two classes of people on the planet: the super-rich, who long ago were ferried off Earth to the space station Elysium, where they can breathe clean air and continue to live in luxury ... and everyone else, still stuck back on Earth.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Max, an ex-con just trying to go straight, who works a factory job helping to build the nuclear-powered robots that serve as the police force now. It's a tough as hell life on Earth, where you are guilty until proven innocent (especially if you have a record) and any attempts to fly an unauthorized ship to Elysium to escape this life might get you shot out of the sky - but after a horrible accident exposes Max to radiation poisoning, giving him only days to live, he throws convention and the law away, getting in touch with his old criminal cronies to find any way he can to Elysium - where medical pods exist, in abundance, that can cure any and all illness in the human body (again, a privilege ONLY now for the rich, in 2154).<br /><br />But on Elysium, the minister of defense, Delacourt (a blonde Jodie Foster, complete with an unidentifiable accent that is so ridiculous, it's distracting) has her own plans. Secretly planning to get the president of Elysium out of office so she can take over in a well-planned coup, those plans are thwarted when some badly-needed information she needs instead ends up with Max ... who, in turn, ends up with Delacourt's whacked-out, insane hired assassin Kruger (Sharlto Copley, as vicious as it gets here) after him.<br /><br />'Elysium' is a good film, I really liked it, but it does suffer a bit from predictability. You'll recognize bits here and there from other science fiction and action films, and again every time Jodie Foster speaks with that obviously-fake accent I just wanted to yell, \\"STOP THAT!\\". But even with standard plot devices and a couple of cartoonish characters, maybe because of Damon the film is still enjoyable to watch, and has some nice suspense that will have you rooting for Max and those he cares about. If you like Damon you should see this, and I even kind of like Jodie as a platinum blonde ... icy as it makes her look.ake accent I just wanted to yell, \\"STOP THAT!\\".

B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love these type of puzzle games and even tho the lower levels are super simple they help me warm up for the difficult boards.  This one is worth downloading and works great on my Fire!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Simply put, EPIC FUN! A must for anyone. Don't delay, get it now. If you don't have it yet, you're missing out.
B009NY43NY|2.0|What was the point in even having this book. Don't waste your time. Very boring and no plot. Just another pitiful attempt to make a good story to sell more books. Should have stopped writing 4  books ago
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is awesome It is  very addictive. If you like games were you have to dodge things then you will like it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Best book I've read in my entire life definitely worth your time and money. Keeps you on the edge of your seat romance mom problems marriage problems and murder problems
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Always great, and getting even better.  The characters and stories continue to grow in interest as we learn more about them.

B008FYZIVY|3.0|I love the story, but the first DVD is very jerky and weird.  I even returned the first copy thinking it was defective, but since the second was the same I assume they are all like this.  Not sure why the visual quality would be so bad.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I found it to be too easy which bored me to no end!! There is just no challenge to it, don't expect to be entertained.
B003QSMC18|1.0|This was so disappointing. I've historically loved Disney movies, but this one was a total waste of time and money. I really wanted to love this story but it had no redeeming points. The prince was a jerk throughout the entire movie, even to the end. The racial stereotypes are sad and exaggerated, as if having an african american princess makes the rest ok. Then there's the voodoo. Magic is one thing, but the extent of voodoo and dark spirituality used was disturbing - certainly not something suitable for children. Don't waste your time or money, you're not missing anything.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I haved enjoyed playing Spider Solitaire for a few years now. It was nice to find the app that works on the Kindle Fire. I seem to have good luck with MobilityWare apps.
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|I love this story, didn't love this version. As others have said, the &#34;digital remastering&#34; left much to be desired. The picture was very dark and made it difficult to see what was going on. As for the story itself, I was disappointed that they left SO much out - most notably much of the witty tête-à-tête between Jane and Rochester. Their conversations in this version lacked much of the interest that was supposed to have made them fall in love. The last scene in particular was extremely disappointing. There are so many better versions of this story, watch one of those... or better yet, read the book.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|Very good for toddlers to learn their abc's. There a several steps to be completed per letter, only thing that is wrong with it is it doesn't use phonics in pronunciation of the words. Buy it if you want to go past the letter D! 22learn, LLC makes good apps.
B002X6PTH8|5.0|Absolutely wonderful, terrific entertainment. Jim Carrey outdoes himself. The special effects are amazing, especially the speed of the Mask character. Finally a happy ending, the good guy wins.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Makes facebook harder rather than easier to manuver around on. Very frustrating, I don't have need for it as fb itself without an app is just as good enough.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Out of all the avengers separate movies, Iron Man is the best. Intense action and some great laughing scenes to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was an absolute amazing finish to the trilogy. The only bad thing I would have to say about this book is that I was sad it ended and the series was over!
B005FISC52|5.0|Such a sad season because it is the last. It's a great show though about growing up in life and moving on. To watch this you need all of their seasons!
0307474712|4.0|I enjoyed the book (and the film) but I found the basis of the book (meetings on the same day at various yearly intervals) a little forced.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this series so so much and can't wait till the next book! The wait is killing me. Great job!
B008Y7FQ6E|3.0|Good movie but not great !! Plot dragged but the scenery and characters brought the folklore to life in this movie. The acting was outstanding.  Tommy Lee Jones and the supporting cast brought credibility to the film.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great companion to the show.  shows fact vs fiction and makes you really think about the 'm legal and prison systems in america
0812417755|5.0|great read, great book.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  I just wanted to give it fie stars, not be required to write a minimum word essay.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It's a great game to pass time. It's not hard at all, have fun and be creative by making the reef all your own.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|AWESOME, high precision mouse at a VERY reasonable price.  It includes a weight set to add some weight to the unit other wise it just glides across the desk like a feather ( i like that feel).  It works great on my macbook pro just fine, however i ony have use of 3 botton on the top of the mouse plus the whee.  The side buttons dont work on a mac but are fantastic when i use the mouse on my windows/linux machines.
0307719774|5.0|Growing up I've always been one to keep a diary. I fell out of this habit as I got older and didn't have the time to painstakingly detail my everyday. Enter the 5-year journal. Everyday you fill out a few lines in this book (probably takes 2 minutes, max) and voila, you're done. I'm nearing the end of my first year now and sometimes when I'm bored I'll go back and re-read my entries from earlier in the year. It's a great way to record your memories in written word. I loved it so much I bought one for my best friend for her birthday.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game has great graphics its basically 3dm. also it has local and global multiplayer.this a great game all in all
0470449764|4.0|Ahh the GMAT. A necessary evil for those of us who want to go to business school. This book is straight from the horse's mouth - the official guide from the GMAC. It's not particularly helpful and doesn't really help and teach you how to do the problems - I highly recommend the Manhattan GMAT books for that, but it definitely was helpful in gauging how difficult the actual test was and how much I needed to prepare.
0618918248|4.0|Really good book, very valid and strong points, the evolution and other and counterpoints to creationist theories are well put together, and explain throughly. The only two things keeping me from giving it five stars are, how repetitive it became after just a few chapters, and the second be in more of a let down on the quality of writing I was expecting...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I use to play this game on moms kindle now I have one she bought it about 4 months ago for 1.00<br />but now its free I'm so happy<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game<br />also try angry birds space 2<br /><br />sincerely<br />a 12 year old
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A favorite of our family.<br />We like the twists,the humor and the thrill!<br />Awesome project.<br />You guys must see the Part 2 also.<br />They put the right actors together<br />for this film.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Contains a lot of information about the life and times of Jesus. It's an evidence based approach to the extraordinary claims made by Christians which uses what is known about first century Palestine, Jewish and Roman history and biblical texts themselves to create a logical examination of the life and teachings of Jesus.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Professor Dawkins really does a brilliant job in this book of explaining how modern science reveals truly astonishing and difficult to understand ideas about nature.  His discussion is wide ranging and so easy to understand.  I'm a huge fan of Carl Sagan and modern science writing, but this book really stands out by the way Dawkins distills down so many wonderful ideas in such a clear and succinct fashion.  It's an easy and enjoyable read.  Science literacy is a massive and critical challenge for the world, and this book is a big step forward in helping the public understand and appreciate what science has to offer.  I would personally like it to be mandatory reading for all middle or high school students.

0345525558|3.0|Review: The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh<br /><br />I can’t tell a daisy from a daffodil, and before I read The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh I didn’t know they could speak. I recall, in my youth, that florists had this motto, “Say it with flowers” but I never gave it much thought except that any old flowers you bought from them ought to be good enough to say: “Looky, I just spent all this dough on you, so it means I care.” So reading this novel has the upside for trolls like me of a take away. I learned something that just might serve me beyond a score in Trivial Pursuits.<br /><br />The author’s story is one of very damaged characters who have severe emotional problems that make it difficult for them to communicate verbally but each of them has compensated for this disability by being keenly aware of the emotions attributed to specific flowers and uses them as a substitute for verbalizing their feelings. Diffenbaugh tells her story with workmanlike prose that does not overshadow a clever, and at times brilliantly compelling plot. She offers an engaging narrative that is a quick read and that, for her, is fortunate because if given time to stop and think about the plot points and the character development one would be forced to conclude that at many spots along the way, the narrative would be thin on credulity.<br /><br />Victoria, the heroine is extremely damaged goods and is unable to communicate with others, much less engage in a normal relationship, so her story of establishing a successful floral business is quite a stretch. Her foster parent, Elizabeth, is equally troubled and tormented, and her nephew, Grant, seems to lack the full range of emotions one might expect from someone with his upbringing. Throughout the book, I wondered where his anger went, finding him the least believable. Ultimately, I was forced to conclude that Diffenbaugh’s flowers had a broader range of emotions than her characters.<br /><br />I found The Language of Flowers a fun read and consumed it in three modest sittings, I’d say it’s worth your entertainment bucks but it is not fine literature. Were it not for the knowledge to be gained from learning about the language of flowers, it would not have gotten my recommendation.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|I thought the movie was entertaining but not as humorous as the first one.  I would recommend the movie just don't expect as much situations as RED1.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I don't know who would consider this movie a piece of art or even interesting.  It is just another dark, pathetic story about searching for yourself on your old self.  It's been done too many times and it's frankly not interesting.  I think we all go through periods like that in our life times and it's different for everyone.  However, you have to be in the same depressive mood to find this movie inspiring and interesting.  Otherwise, you'll find it boring and pathetic like I did.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Enjoying this game greatly, I'm just confused about the daily quests that the iOS has. I haven't been able to find them in the Android version.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved everything in the book from the first page to the last word. If you've read the first two books, you'll love the City of Glass most.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|This movie is very funny; it is why I give it 2 stars. It also is just stupid humor which is why it was only given 2 stars out of a possible 5. The movie also centers its humor around a juvenile interpretation of funny. It also caters to an audience that not only finds a spider bite on the genital area hilarious but in addition somehow believes displaying the genitals affected by the bite (not once but 3 times in the movie) is even more hilarious to its viewing audience? If you find slapstick humor accompanied with a twist of perversion makes you laugh then I recommend this movie for you. Also, if you find viewing a teenage boy's penis with a grotesquely swollen spider-bit testicle hilariously funny and entertaining than this movie is definitely for you to go see!  Clearly the focus was not on exploiting the sexy appeal of the drop-dead-gorgeous adult body of Jennifer Anniston and was more on borderline child pornography given that the movie seemed to focus more viewing time on a teenage boy's genitals adversely affected by a spider bite!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My 5  year old son is loving this game.  He loves zoos and animals.  My other son is whining because he wants to play also.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|I am a Gerontologist and have recommended this book to many people.  It is so enlightening to 'get inside the head' of someone with Alzheimer's Disease.  Right up there with Richard Taylor's real life description of his experiences.
B002RKSZKI|3.0|I tried to give Austen a chance, but it doesn't seem to be my cup of tea (no pun intended). I love the free books Amazon offers. I hope others enjoy this book more than I do.
B00F2362IE|1.0|I'm actually quite upset that a game that charges $4 for it only has 1 character unlocked at the start of the game. I played for a LONG time to earn enough coins for my son so he could unlock the next turtle. Now he's crying because he doesn't understand that I can't just unlock them all for him. I'm not paying even more money to unlock the rest of the characters. I expect this from a free game. Shame on the app developer for being extra greedy.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|i didn't realize there were so many REM songs that i was not privy to until i purchased this set. great selection of their hits and some not so big hits..
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The Reek chapters are some of Martin's best writing yet. I'll grant you more could have happened in Tyrion's story, but the stage has been set for &#34;The Winds of Winter&#34; very well.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i did enjoy this book, even though some people feel that it is nasty i just think it's a good escape from reality. it's not the best written book by far but who cares? I certainly didn't expect a stellar plot or composition.
B00F1W1S1M|4.0|Amazing concert! No doubt that Dream Theater on their second half of their career. New drummer Mike Mangini is awestanding! No need to look back. Some of the cameras are not HD thus you will see some degradation on image quality during some scenes.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I normally try out most any free Amazon app of the day but end up removing it after trying the app a couple of times. I installed this one while drinking my morning coffee in bed one Saturday morning and only stopped playing 3 hours later because I had an appointment! I thought about the game all day and couldn't wait to get back to it! I finished the game during Sunday morning coffee and was sad to have it end! Some games like candy crush get so difficult at the end they are impossible to finish unless you start purchasing extras and I hate that in a game. This one had no ads and if I got really stuck there was a hint option.  I plan on purchasing additional games like this from this vendor and that is something I very rarely do.<br />The only drawback is I may never get out of bed!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This story was so captivating and brought emotion out of me at every turn. I was so sad when the last book ended because there was no more to read.

B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Lost over $100.00  buying coins &amp;  crowns.  Kept getting an error message.  The game locks up often. I would rather play the original game on Facebook.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|This one of the best interactive books I have seen. At first I thought my 4 and 6  year olds would be afraid because of the Whine character . But they loved it please make more books it's worth every penny. There is so much to do.
0316228583|3.0|The first 3/4 of the book was laying the groundwork and was tedious to say the lease.  It picked up speed near the end and neatly tied up all the loose ends
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was very pleased with this game even tho I initially balked at spending $5 on an app game. I was so impressed with the story and graphics...I'm thinking these games will be my payday treat till I play them all!

0399230033|5.0|Far beyond my expectations!!! This is a beautiful book!  The colors are bright and cheerful. The story is hilarious, yet easy to understand for a small child. I bought the board book edition for my 18 month grandson. I'm sure he will love it!  I think the lack of text is a real plus! Only a few words are necessary. The rest is up to the child and the story teller. I highly recommend this book!
0804137501|4.0|I found that the book explained the benefits to managing a largely remote team. It also explained some of the pitfalls when trying to have a remote workforce. While it's a good read, I wouldn't use it as a holy bible on the subject. Take their experiences and shape them in to something that works for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|after a hard day of work I like to play this to relax...even if I have trouble clearing all the jelly!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|It does not work with all Kindle Fires.  Just another way to try to make us spend more money.  Why should I upgrade when mine is working just fine.  Don't say it works for Kindle Fire when it does not work with all.  VERY UNHAPPY
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It is very simple but does exactly what you want it to do, entertain!  It's addictive and fun.  The time passes quickly while playing and doesn't eat up a lot of battery.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Martin always does a great job with 'twists,' and nobody does better dialogue, but his character development isn't questionable, it's non-existent.  Everyone just dies.  Hopefully in the next book he finds a way to 'resurrect' some characters, or maybe we're just supposed to *think* they're dead...
B00G7QPYX4|4.0|Whatever the strengths and weaknesses of Allen's yearly offerings, you have to admire a man that<br />is in his 70s, has made 44 movies, and yet seems to keep trying to stretch his wings, and style,<br />while still retaining a very recognizable film-making technique. Allen's films are always clearly<br />his, yet the tone, feel and structure of the films almost always has something a little new. In<br />this case, Allen is going for straight drama, (yes there are a few amusing moments, but in general<br />this is pretty serious stuff) something he hasn't done since \\"Match Point\\". But \\"Match Point\\" also<br />had the structure of being a mystery/thriller, whereas \\"Blue Jasmine\\" is a character study, pure<br />and simple. And in that it's not quite like anything Allen has done in his many, many films. The<br />earlier dramas like \\"Interiors\\" or \\"Another Woman\\" were both more stylized and weren't really<br />about dissecting a single fatally flawed character as if under a microscope.<br /><br />This grew on me on a second viewing. Some of my problems remained; a lot of the supporting characters<br />are stereotypes, in spite of being played by wonderful actors, doing all they can to bring them life. But<br />the great Cate Blanchett, who seems incapable of being less than amazing, somehow manages to bring<br />reality, humanity and sometimes even pathos to this self-involved borderline crazy and theatrical mess<br />of a human being.<br /><br />Whatever the quibbles, this is intelligent, grown up film-making, trying to grapple with big questions of<br />morality and personal responsibility, and unafraid of being a study of a largely unlikable woman. Allen is<br />still among the braver and least compromised of U.S.  directors, and continues to be worth watching<br />and supporting.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After seeing the movie, I had to read the book to see if I missed anything. Even though I enjoyed the movie,  the book, as usual, is better than the movie. can't wait to read the last installation.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a fun program for a student studying a language. It helps build vocabulary thru reading, writing, hearing, and speaking the target language. It starts at a beginner level but gradually moves towards higher levels.<br />Each lesson is completed painlessly in a few minutes. I have already recommended it to several friends.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! One of the best books I've ever read! It's on the same level as the Hunger Games and Harry Potter, which in my books is the best of the best.
B00DJYKFXG|4.0|There have been quite a few splendid reviews already that I mostly agree with so I will keep this brief.  If you are a fan of the Band, but don't worship them, I'm not sure the additional material in this box is worth it if you already own the 2 CD version of Rock of Ages.  But since this is probably my all time favorite live album from one of my favorite bands, I knew I would eventually pick this up.<br /><br />The mixes are different for both sets and add a great new element for those of us used to the previous versions.  As much as I worship Allen Toussaint and think the horn playing on these shows are outrageously soulful, I rather like having the option of hearing the Band be the focus here.  (I'll always have the originals).<br /><br />What keeps this from being five stars is the repeat performances.  If you're going to randomly alter the set list from the first two discs and remix the sound anyway, why not give us alternate performances from nights other than the December 31st show?  There's no need to have the same two versions of 13 of the songs.  Frustrating decision making.  Wouldn't it be great if we could experience alternate versions of songs like King Harvest, The Shape I'm In, W.S. Walcott etc.. instead of hearing slightly different mixes of the same performance?<br /><br />That critique aside, this has been playing non stop in my house for two weeks straight now.  I am eternally grateful these moments with Rick, Richard, Levon, Garth and Robbie at the height of their craft were captured on tape.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|Wonderful - Great story, wonderful costumes and the acting was superb! I would definitely recommend it.  Using Prime was easy!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Classic Frankie Valley! I bought two of these CD's, one for a friend and one for myself and I am so glad I got one for myself. I enjoy listening to Frankie Valley but this CD is clear sounding. It has many classic Frankie Valley songs which I enjoy so much.
B00AW57L96|5.0|The synopsis of the story has been well described in other reviews.  Suffice to say that &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; has interwoven the story of three characters.  However, I t is not a novel the reader can just skim as one is introduced to many characters which can be a bit confusing at times.  However, it is worth the effort to learn to get to know the characters associated with the three heroines.<br />From the time I picked up this story, I was enthralled and needed to keep reading. Not only did I want to know the secret of what was in the letter written by John-Paul to his wife, Cecilia fifteen years before just after the birth of their daughter, Isabel, but I became involved with the stories of the lives of the other heroines, Tess and Rachel. The different perspectives of the characters was made more interesting as they were all at various ages: Rachel was 70 while Cecilia was 42 and the reader wonders why and how the three characters are related.<br />I was totally enthralled with &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; and did not work out what the secret was (which is unusual for me).<br /><br />I have not read any prior books of Liane Moriarty's but will certainly look them up as I believe this is her fifth book.<br />I would strongly recommend this book  as it holds the interest of the reader throughout
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game. much improved on my kindle now. I play more on my phone but am pleased with this app.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great, fast reading Grisham thriller!  This book is the sequal to &#34;a time to kill&#34; and follows pretty much the same characters through another racially charged &#34;Old South&#34; scenario.  In his usual style, Grisham brings the characters to life and makes you feel the situation as it unfolds.  This book is hard to put down.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I know they have a minimum number of words required for rating a product. Not much to say however than the product works! It was purchased at a terrific price. I am satisfied with the purchase!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|IT IS NOT COOL<br />It is  not normal cookbook I ok I I. I'm I ANGENT if I had I. I'm
145210655X|5.0|What an awesomely cute story for father and son! My son loves to have it read to him. It's not much of a story, but rather one comic per page. We have to improvise a bit on the pages w/o words but our 3 year old loves it. This is a perfect gift for a Star Wars nerd to pass on to his son!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great app that has you addicted at every turn. It's a lot of fun. It is awesome exciting game
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Loved this ! What a great story arc! What a great way to start the new 52! The Court of Owls are such a classic batman villain and just fitted so well with the batman universe and it is a must read!!!!
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|Honestly, she's the type of person I'd probably want to punch if I had to be in the same room with her obnoxious ass. HOWEVER. She nailed it. Thank God someone has the feballs to step out of the, &#34;I'm a Disney puppet, and I have to pretend like I'm a perfect role model for kids for the rest of my g-rated little life&#34; ideal. Ew, please. She's annoying, but she's grown. Get over it, moms. If you want a role model for your kids, keep them on current Disney, not past Disney.
B004GYOQ6A|4.0|This is a fun game and great for killing time. It has dozens and dozens of mazes to play and the ability to make your own mazes, but as of this time I have not tried making my own. The only thing<br />I had a problem with was inverting the X,Y,Z for the tilting. When<br />I set it to work in the calibration it tilted different in game play so<br />I just had to try another combination then it worked just fine.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I chose this book because it's a movie.  little did I know how truly beautiful a story this is.  I very rarely am affected by what I read but this book is an exception.  I was brought to tears a few times at the sincerity and simplicity of the people during this horrendous period in our human history.  A must read......
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a page turner.... I want more and I look forward to purchasing the next book really soon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids age 6 and 9 both love this game. I even like to play with them! Make sure you have a password set. It is really really easy for them to buy stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game , but hate when I have to wait to go to the next level because I didn 't get thu it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is alot of fun, it makes you really think about the moves before you actually  make the move..It was a free app that is very nice.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It's not too easy, and not frustratingly hard. Definitely a thinking man's game.<br /><br />At this price you owe it to yourself to give it a try!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|While story was well paced and entertaining, the ending felt rather predictable. The parts where the author attempted to include detail of certain technologies annoyed me, while commendable, is incorrect and would not have affected the story if excluded. But that seems like nit picking.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|Fun game with challenging puzzles and sequences. It does have quite a few HOS.  I'm not a huge fan of those, but they really don't take away from the game.  Cool story line too. Worth the cash overall.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Subtle, sophisticated understanding of our social-media-crazy world. Eggers does not necessarily have the most complex writing style, but that makes the story even more easy to grasp. I devoured the book and it made me think twice about going to Facebook. Should be mandatory reading for all these college kids glued to their devices.
B00280LYHS|5.0|EpicepicepicepicepicepicepicepicpeicepiepicepicepicepcepicepicepiclyepicNess book of total of  freaking awesomeness the book was so cool I wish I had the exact same life as percy Jackson
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Well written and paced. Made me want to keep turning the pages. Also made me think that we probably all have a secret or two best kept secret.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the most interesting games I have played.  Great graphics. I can't wait to get to the next piece of the puzzle.  Makes me think.  I have to pay attention.  One of the best.  Five stars all day!
B00G5G7FL0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. Frozen is excellent family entertainment. It is not, however, the return to form that so many people seem to be trumpeting it to be. If you're looking for a family friendly movie that you and your kids will love, look no further. The characters are fun, quick, and utterly charming. The visuals are nothing short of gorgeous. The musical numbers are outstanding and the cast handles them wonderfully. The film delivers on the promise of a strong, likeable female lead that many people feel [[ASIN:B005LAIHZY Brave (Three-Disc Collector's Edition: Blu-ray / DVD)]] was unable to fulfill.That Frozen is a good movie is not in question, and if all you're looking for is a great family film, you can ignore everything that follows this paragraph. Go see it, pre-order it, and enjoy. If you're looking for a return to the true Disney magic however, you may be disappointed.<br /><br />Again, I enjoyed Frozen, but the writing is just not up to \\"Golden Age Disney\\" quality. The main conflict of the movie could have been easily avoided by a little more TLC and a little less \\"cutting your child off from the world\\". The plot, too often, depends on misunderstandings of epic proportions. The \\"villain\\" of the story has little to no actual impact on the film as a whole, and the final solution to Elsa's problem is far too convenient and rather lazy. None of these things will effect the enjoyment of a very young child, the target audience, but the shame of it is that what made Disney great in their hey day was that ALL AGES could easily enjoy their films. The writing in Beauty and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty, Mulan, Aladdin, Tarzan, The Aristocats, The Rescuers, ect was excellent, managing to entertain children while at the same time engaging adults, and it is that last part that Frozen doesn't quite manage to get right.<br /><br />This minor issue aside though Frozen is an excellent movie, that any family will love. It is well worth your time and money, but it doesn't' quite reach the heights of its predecessors. A definite see and, upon its release, a buy.
0307913147|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this (audio) book.  The futuristic story entails a hugely immersive video game with a similarly huge reward for whoever wins the game.  I felt the story kept moving at a good pace, I cared about the clever good guys and the bad guys were frustratingly clever as well.  And, just as important, the plotline was not like any I had read before.<br /><br />I believe the book will especially resonant with people who, like me, grew up at the dawn of the video game age, that is, back when shopping malls had game rooms with many different stand alone video machines such as Galaga, Pac Man, Asteroids and Battle Zone.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's account of his time in heaven rings true for me in part because it was so hard for him to describe.  Yet, he finds words that convince me he was there.  The fact this near death experience happened to a neurosurgeon made this story all the more understandable and believable.  God doesn't make mistakes.
0767847431|5.0|Fascinating and full of great special effects. Loved it. I have since ordered the sequels/prequels. Love them all, great addition to my movie collection.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is the best ever, I have it on my wii u and I've been waiting for it to come to the Amazon app store and now its here
B005LAII4E|4.0|Well made but only moderately well written and acted.  Good action sequences and decent special effects.  Not quite as good as the first GI Joe movie
B004LROUW2|4.0|We might all have one book in us but certainly not this book. Incredibly imaginative but very long. It says 3 books but they are not stand alone, more like 3 parts.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|We truly loved this movie.  It is very well written and acted, with an intriguing and sometimes creepy concept.  We have really enjoyed the last few movies Tom Cruise has been in, and this continues that trend.  There are a few action sequences, but those are not the main point of the movie.  WAYYYYY better than After Earth!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Relaxing  game.  Fun for  all ages. Great way to spend down time. Whether I am home or waiting for an appointment.<br />Good for travel time.
B00C2PO09I|5.0|This is another movie that I give 5 stars for the intriguing and beautifully executed idea, but my wife would give 4 stars because the story was a bit slow and predictable at times.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this on pure potential, youtube streaming now is a bonus. This device has soo much potential the things that it does now is in beta but works seamlessly.<br /><br />Con: no streaming youtube directly from the web browser on ios.<br />no streaming of videos on websites such as watchdub
B0090SI4OC|5.0|My wife absolutely loved this movie so I gave it 5 stars, personally I would only give it 4.  It is a well made but often predictable rethink of the body snatchers idea
B00F0AI9Y4|2.0|Tim..Tim...Tim... This album isn't even worth the $2 I spent on it. Get Le7els or something other than this album because it is a experimental album. Not TRUE EDM, the only two songs I actually wanted weren't included in this version, Long Road to Hell and EDOM. Highly recommend Burns-Lies (Otto Knows remix) than this entire album.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie overall and definitely give it five stars, I can overlook the cheesy backstory because the main story was so darn fun.  My wife would give it 4 stars though; she felt it was too similar to the old Japanese Godzilla movies.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome book.  So many good life lessons it . Great for any age and brilliantly written. I saw the movie and it made me want to read the book. I bought the series and love them.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|The best Arnie movie in a long time.  Not overly original, but good action and humor throughout, along with an enjoyable supporting cast
B002BWP49C|5.0|Great story...I think I enjoyed this Director the most.  The first one was so green tinted that it seemed like it was cheaply made....the next ones just get better and better!
B00BEWF5IK|5.0|\\"Extraordinary Rendition\\" is a violation of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT), because suspects are taken to countries where torture during interrogation remains common, thus circumventing the protections the captives would enjoy in the United States or other nations who abide by the terms of UNCAT. Its legality remains highly controversial, as the United States outlaws the use of torture, and the U.S. Constitution guarantees due process. Rendered suspects are denied due process because they are arrested without charges, deprived of legal counsel, and illegally transferred to a third world country with the intent and purpose of facilitating torture and other interrogation measures which would be illegal in the USA.<br />But the U.S. decided it needed a program under the Clinton Administration to \\"debrief\\" terrorist \\"suspects,\\" and this was born.<br />This movie puts you as close to the blood and torture as you can get without getting the blood on you, just as it does the American C.I.A. agent played by Jake Gyllenhaat, running the interrogation. The whole point is no Americans are directly involved, that's why it happens in a foreign country-he is told not to even speak directly to the suspect but to voice his concerns through the local, that way the U.S. has complete deniability. There are so many twists and turns, plots within subplots you stay on the edge of your seat trying to figure out what comes next. Meanwhile Terrorism 101 is running unmitigated in the streets. I will not give the story away except to say the unthinkable is being directed from the highest level of the U.S. government; a cold blooded serpent played by Meryl Streep, which acts with complete impunity against anyone that is Arabic. I don't know who's the most vicious, Streep's character, or the man doing the actual torture. But strangely enough, a low level C.I.A. agent, finds he has a conscience, and has to decide whether his duty is to the agency he works for, or the ideal he believes in, called America.<br />You will not be bored, you will not forget, and its happening right now. Think of \\"Rendition\\" as \\"Body of Lies\\" on steroids.or the ideal he believes in, called America.<br />You will not be bored, you will not forget, and its happening right now. Think of \\"Rendition\\" as \\"Body of Lies\\" on steroids.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Great way to tell the age old story of Sleepy Hollow.  This movie will immediately have you interested!  Great acting!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book reminds me why I enjoyed John Grisham books.  I am glad to see him back to his original style.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|First season was amazing.  New stars, new stories, really enjoy the &#34;sweet love story&#34; that the director presents to the audience!
B008OOYALE|2.0|I played this game on my galaxy s ii phone and on my kindle fire. I had to reset both my phone and my kindle. My acct on my phone recovered right away no lag at all. However, my acct on my kindle is not recovering and it wants me to start a more acct from the beginning. I miss my neighbors and friends on the kindle acct.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|One of Depps best!  The balance between musical and easy to watch movie is fantastic.  Will watch again and again!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Riveting and exciting.  Didn't want to put the book down.  All the characters were intensely described and you felt like you knew them quite well.
B00G9QLP9Y|4.0|Having the ability to check locations is helpful but I would really like to be able to get directions with it. I will need another app for that.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A classic sweet movie, with great actors, great scenery and a wholesome engaging storyline. The movie takes us through a year in the life of a family highlighted by holidays. It is a wonderful, timeless story of love and family togetherness. The music in it is amazing! You can't help but sing along and wish you'd been born in that era.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|All the functionality of the full website with the portability of the mobile app. Makes keeping up with my contacts and posting my own content easy when I'm on the go.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I have read every Stephen King book and I although some are better than others, this one is just awful. There is way too much time devoted to 12 step philosophy. I believe in the power of aa but I don't want to read about it in a work of fiction. I wonder if Mr. King is trying to leave a spiritual legacy. Keep it in the meeting rooms and out of your books though. No way this is on par with the shining. Worst of all...it was NOT scary!  Not in the slightest and I'm an easy scare.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are smooth and it's easy to advance in the game. Fun for horse lovers of all ages! Definitely worth downloading.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I saw my brother in law playing this game and had to see if it was available on the kindle. gameplay is fun graphics are pretty good. you can waste alot of time playing this one be careful.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Didn't care for this game.  Not sure what all the rage is.  After playing a bit, I deleted it from my phone.
006202406X|1.0|Don't waste your time! Unless you enjoy reading a waste of a good story!<br />I loved the first two books of the series.<br />I bought the hard covers.<br />I told everyone about these wonderful books.<br />I pre-ordered Allegiant.<br />I waited and waited for it for weeks.<br />I tracked my UPS package every 10 minutes.<br />And when I read Allegiant I read a poorly written book with an extremely bad ending! An extremely, unnecessarily bad ending. The whole idea of true self sacrifice could have been achieved without the bad ending. As a whole nothing really happened in this dystopian world other than learning about it. The world remained the same with no change. What was the point of the story then? What a waste of a good story!!! I will never read a Veronica Roth book again because now I know how she thanks the fans who pay her bills.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I got the record brand new, just like I had picked it up in a record store. Sounds amazing! Shipping was faster than expected. Thank you very much!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|challenging game! have to play a couple rounds to see exactly what you need to to to beat the level. it is not as mindless as some people think!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game to play very additive. can't stop playing. I have been playing this game for a while now and had gotten suck on some of the levels but once you get thru it it is so much fun.
B003GX5CWY|5.0|this is my favorite Arnold flick.. the only thing better than this would be Chuck Norris in any Vietnam type flick. Chuck rules!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I have to say that when I odered this product I did not think that it would get to me this fast. I am very impressed with they services.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I haven't really enjoyed any of the star trek spin off's. The original series and movies were the best. You aren't going to get a better than you had with the original cast....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and I hope she ends up with Peeta. It made me feel so much for the character and I wish she would just follow her feelings from time to time.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Usually, follow up type movies aren't that good; they tend to disappoint. Not so with this one! I think Red 2 was just as good as Red.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game goes on and on can't put it down the thrill when you almost got it and time runs out.  You got to love this game
B001EC2IV2|3.0|I like the basic plot (it sounds so like what I expect from bureaucrats) but I can only give it three stars because, well... the whole thing with Arnold has gotten pretty overdone.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is very easy.  Make sure you have at least 5 friends it helps with game.  Truth be told it's an alright game.
B0044WSF5M|5.0|classic! this flick is really great not only for it's nostalgia, but the humor and awesome cars in it. This is also an early Harrison Ford appearance, if you care about that...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game to play. Never boring, each level is different &amp; very unique. You'd only play during pass time, but next thing u know, ur hooked :).
B004UPANAI|4.0|pretty good flick. Hugh Jackman will probably be forever remembered as 'the wolverine'. I enjoyed this, but I really don't think I can stomach any more x-men movies. PLEASE MAKE A FEATURE MOVIE ABOUT THE 'FLASH'!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is so much fun. it is the beast shooting game ever. this game has everything that person who likes shooting game wants.
B000I9U8VO|4.0|it's ok... but I'm glad I don't own it; it's one of those kind of movies that you're glad to watch one time. Frankly, the whole 'X' thing is pretty old.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|That is not the only thing we have can be used in the morning of but September I and don't want forget the name is.
B001AMNL2Q|3.0|This is my rifle, this is my gun....this one's for fighting, this ones for fun! The first half of the movie is pretty good, until 'joker' actually gets to 'nam; then it's boring.
0399161287|5.0|I had not planned on reading this book, but after hearing the excellent reviews for the book on the Opie and Anthony radio program, I decided to see for myself and I am glad that I did.  I would like to compare this to the recent autobiography of Tom Sizemore because what both these books have in common is a brutal honesty about how drugs and booze destroyed two very promising careers.  Tyson was one of the best boxers ever at one point and Sizemore was and should have been one of the biggest actors in hollywood.  This book is not easy to read in that it is raw and honest.  From Tyson's brutal childhood in Brownsville Brooklyn to his recent one man show and appearances in the Hangover, this book tells it all.  For all the stuff in the book about growing up in Brownsville, boxing, Don King, drugs, booze, women, the thing that I found most interesting is that Iron Mike has a soft spot for fellow Brooklyner Barbara Streisand!  This is not a typical celeb bio, this book is really raw and honest.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I love country music. Gwyneth Paltrow did a great job in this movie.<br />Thank you,<br />Linda
0307341577|5.0|What can I say other than I both love and hate Gillian Flynn's books...BUT, her stories keep me reading and reading and reading!
B00005JMCW|5.0|I just love this movie. It is so funny. I had seen it years ago and decided to order it.<br />Thank you,<br />Linda
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Enjoyed from beginning to end. Fast moving, great bunch of characters, sucks you right in to the story. Another book I ended up staying up late reading to see what was going to happen next.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I had bought 3 stylus prior to this one I spent anywhere from $30 on 1 to $10 on another but once I found this one all the others got tossed in the junk drawer! This works great in my IPhone 4 and my kindle fire I use it mainly in the IPhone on the draw with friends 2 game....
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly  enjoyed this book!! Parts were difficult to read because of violence, but I knew it was coming. I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one stood up to his high standards!! I highly recommend it!! But if you haven't read &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;, please read it before you read &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;!!
B00CM03H4C|5.0|This exceeded my expectations! I listen to it almost non-stop and love the mix of moods I experience when I listen to it. I still haven't seen the movie (Baz Luhrmann's version), but I can hardly wait to do so!
1593275080|5.0|Two words: simply stunning. When I first saw this book being announced, I knew I had to have it.  It's filled with breathtakingly sharp colour images of models that will blow you away. Think of this book as a catalogue of some of the world's most amazingly creative models and dioramas. The complexity ranges from entire mountain-side models of a Sci-Fi world to stunning mech models to super minimalistic caricatures.  My favourites from this book are the derelict houses, the almost photo realistic bird models and the space ship models.  There are so many models in this book by so many different creators, that there is bound to be something in here for everyone. I'm actually running out of adjectives and superlatives to adequately describe this book.<br />This book would make a great gift for anyone who likes LEGO or simply appreciates art and creativity.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Saw the movie first (well done as adaptations go) and after reading the book love the story even more.  I especially enjoyed the gentle treatment of religion, almost respectful even.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B005PK57IK|5.0|It's a great drama. Great acting  with unique & interesting characters with excellent writing! You become involved with the characters !
B007JMW46U|5.0|You just gotta love Sherlock! It's been many years since I've read this book, so I decided to read it again. It is just as good the second time.<br /><br />A neighbor of mine has Aspergers, and he is just like Sherlock! So while reading it this second time I could totally see my neighbor acting the part of Sherlock. Amazing that Arthur Doyle nailed it, especially since I don't know if Aspergers was even diagnosed as a medical condition at the time.<br /><br />Now onto the next Sherlock book!

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|In this text Aslan purports Biblical texts to be inaccurate on the basis of having been written by those too biased to relate reality. He has researched the ancient culture of Palestine to a great extent. He relies upon other historical texts e.g. Josephus and Tacitus giving them great latitude regarding the messages and recordings which they posit. It is my sense that Aslan is speaking from the academic perspective and approach of the 20th century and applying this perspective to the times of Jesus of Nazareth. It is not necessarily unreasonable for him to do this. That approach, however, brings to the conversation other biases which would surely rival the religious biases the first century followers of Jesus would have had. The difference for Aslan in comparison to the writers of the first century is that those writers almost universally were executed for what they wrote, and I do not think Aslan faces the same risk. Humanity, in general, does not pursue fictional events to the point of execution.<br /><br />I find Aslan to report a section of the Bible and then reject it out of hand. I do not find him supporting his perspective well enough  to find it convincing. I find that upon investigating squabbles around me one person seems to be right until the alternate party is questioned. Bits of truth and reality are determined by looking at both sides of a situation. I find Aslan rejects the things which he finds less plausible than he deems necessary according to the criteria and conclusions he has drawn from those who have tried to investigate these things many years after the facts. I found this type of thing to be recurring to the point where I lost faith in his objectivity.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Awesome book kept me hooked from the very first chapter I cannot wait to read the next.  I LOST my self in the macgil kingdom following Thor on his adventure.
0743270754|5.0|Excellent biography of four important leaders that forged the republican party in the crucible of the civil war. The book revealed to me Lincolns ability to use others and his own personal sacrifices in the pursuit of a valuable ideals. I also found Sewards story remarkable. Would one of our leaders today put aside his own ambitions and truly follow another?

B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I was so disappointed. Having Scarpetta go to Sandy Hook was a red herring. There was no mystery in those deaths, just the deepest pain for our world. The first half of the book contained so much description of furnishings that I thought I was reading Better Homes without the illustrations (I know, hyperbole). Between too much description of furnishings, and Benton  Marino's  grooming habits, I missed some of the most important causal relationships, if they were actually written in.<br /><br />The book was so scattered that one might hope that its her last and she's tying up all her loose ends, ending with Christmas in Miami with the family and a nice homeless guy who just happened to be a character witness?

B00BMKDTNC|1.0|When Brandon Sanderson took over to finish out the series I was overjoyed and high hopes, as I am a huge fan of his Mistborn and Stormlight Archive series' and the first two of his continuation kept that hope alive. Then this came along and felt so horribly wrong, so terribly forced, it was like reading someone's bad fan-fiction. Out of all the &#34;main&#34; characters maybe 1/3rd of them ended in a way that felt at all true to their characters. The final resolution was completely hallow and flew in the face of the entire series up to this point.<br /><br />I honestly did not see it coming that it would be ended this wrongly based on how the build up had been progressing.<br />People acted out of character, established mechanics were thrown out the window, more or less new characters thrown in to do heroic bits of craziness and so many holes left in story lines and unexplored avenues. I am bitterly disappointed on the level of having thrown this book out mentally and chosen my own ending for everyone from where book 13 left off.<br /><br />I can only conclude there was just too much left to do and a publisher who wanted this to be the end, so we got a haphazard bastardization of a finale just for the sake of being done, because I find it hard to believe this was how Robert Jordan would've ended it, or that this is how Brandon Sanderson would've truly wrapped things up had he had the time and space.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|The first part of the book is excellent. A very interesting and mysterious concept.<br />The second part loses some of the interest. Just a Run and Escape part with not so much interest. This is the reason for only 4 stars.<br />A very surprising ending.

B004B8DH98|5.0|Like a few of the best films of the 70's some of which were set in Italy and France, some of them American, some Italian, and some French, this Italian and American production of \\"The American\\" is perfectly paced, and the tone and cadences evoke emotional subtleties that keep the audience poised between the film's orchestrated mixture of genres--suspense, intrigue, romance, and espionage. Feeling and thought are centered by this film, which sets out primarily to serve those two ideals, much more so than merely to entertain, as do, say, any one of Tom Clancy's numbingly action packed over the top espionage novels, books which lend themselves to translation into numbingly action packed 'movies'. Writer Martin Booth, author of \\"A Very Private Gentleman\\"' the novel upon which \\"The American\\" was based, is a far more thoughtful writer than Clancy ever sought to be. Thus, \\"The American\\" cleaves to feeling and thought to successfully beat out patriotism and testosterone.<br /><br />This it does through its use of time, silence, and pacing. Each scene, most of them played at a languid pace in medium to long takes, exacts the perfect amount of time necessary to reinforce the film's core thoughtfulness (or maybe I should more accurately say 'mindfulness') with pacing and duration determined by the emotional weight of what is happening within each scene: some scenes are long takes, full of silence (as when 'Mr. Butterfly\\" sits in cafes reading newspapers or sits alone in his bungalow demonstrating his characteristic suffering solitude--machining and drilling his 'artisan's' gun and bullets to sell to another assassin); some scenes however have the feel of being suddenly cut off in mid stride (as when the priest who befriends him seeks a confession from Butterfly, but ends up confessing himself instead, and then challenges Butterfly with the question, left unanswered, \\"What do YOU have?\\" As Butterfly looks away in profile, seemingly pained by the question, the scene suddenly cuts, at precisely the right moment).<br /><br />This is  reminiscent of the works of 70's American filmmakers like Arthur Penn, Peter Bogdanovich, and William Friedkin, or of Polish director Roman Polanski or French director Jean Luc Goddard, all of whom used drastic discontinuity in their narratives and mise-en-scenes. Overall, the brooding, silence-filled sequences achieve the aim of emotional tension, as in Michelangelo Antonioni's films; fitting for a narrative set in Italy as is \\"The American.\\"<br /><br />What is most impressive about director Anton Corbijn's and screenwriter Rowan Joffe's work here though, is a surprising tenderness and poignancy achieved through the subplot of Butterfly's love affair with a prostitute. Let's face it, this is a plot point laden with the baggage of narrative cliche--the hooker with a heart of gold and the killer who yearns to find love with her! Yet, a film of such exact emotional clarity and visual grace can and does carry the cliche off by investing it with the one sure fire method of making us care: it's the characters--the people in this cliche situation that we either care about or don't.<br /><br />Thanks to the lost, yearning, and vulnerable edge that George Clooney brings to Butterfly and that Violante Placido brings to the prostitute character, and thanks to the way the two of them fit so surely into each other's silences, each other's emotional desire, and into each other's arms, bumbling their way past each other's defenses, we DO care. Love is the most ancient theme of all human drama and narrative, and redemptive love, well, that's the dream of all human dreams. We wish for these characters to transcend cliche, to escape their former lives, to be redeemed.<br /><br />Thanks to the tenderness that dialogue, cinematography, acting, and mise-en-scene evoke whenever these two are together, the film does manage to transcend the mundane elements of plot.<br /><br />Corbijn's use of and focus upon Clooney's aging body also,is an effective means of pulling us, through empathy, into the suspense, the tension, and the physical risk as well as emotional risk Butterfly is going through. The camera work and editing depend upon  cold light, monochromatic color schemes, shadow, and the claustrophobic spaces of a small Italian village contrasted to the periodic bursts of monumental open spaces, of mountains in the background (probably the Italian Alps) when Butterfly drives along the rural roads between towns. In the cold, monochromatic interiors George Clooney's skin looks pallid, corpse-like. His lover is lit by a lurid red light filter, an almost tongue-in-cheek visual pun (she is in a 'red light district' if such a small rural village can be said to have such). Her body, like Butterfly's, is therefore a deadened mat upon which social entrapment is projected. The contrast is quick to come: when they begin to date, they venture out together into ecstatic sunlight and into cafes and patisseries, and their bodies take on the life and color of a full spectrum. Their love for one another literally raises them from the dead, visually.<br /><br />Thoughtful writing and direction imply a plethora of unspoken narrative details and back story (the vaguely military tattoos on Butterfly's aging skin, the implication that his fatigue has come after a long multinational career as a murderer, and the flashbacks to the murder he commits at the film's start, a murder that has burdened him with guilt). All of which deepen the humanity of this portrayal of a killer who has grown old and tired of solitude and violence. This very same theme was expertly carried off a few years back by David Cronenberg in his violence diptych, \\"A History of Violence\\" and \\"Eastern Promises,\\" films which presented a character similar to Butterfly: a killer whose past entraps him but who is so thoroughly desperate to escape it that he practically wills the redemption he seeks, driven by both romantic and familial love.<br /><br />Some critics have expressed disdain for \\"The American\\" both because of the cliche elements and because of the quality it displays of imbalance, incompleteness, and uneven narrative momentum, I would argue however that the film's cliches are a means to a thematic end well realized (while the film's tragic ending kills any taint of sentimentality the narrative might have been marred by). \\"The American\\"'s unevenness, the imbalance of its narrative, keep us on edge enough to care about these doomed characters. Penn, Bogdanovitch, Friedkin, and Polanski all presented cinema audiences with exactly the same sort of cinema of complexity transcending mundane mass market Hollywood genres such as the thriller, intrigue, or espionage--complexity achieved through characterization, silence,  mise-en-scene, and emotion rather than action and dialogue. \\"The American\\" descends from this tradition of a cinema of feeling and thought.is an effective means of pulling us, through empathy, into the suspense, the tension, and the physical risk as well as emotional risk Butterfly is going through.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't read a lot of sci-fi, but this was captivating.  I especially like the way Howey migrates from protagonist to protagonist. Very original and enormously though provoking.<br /><br />Hugh, I hope the movie rights make all your dreams come true. -- a new fan.
0307946711|5.0|David Nicholls is an absolutely FANTASTIC writer -- I loved Starter for 10 to bits (as well as its movie adaptation).<br />One Day, however, struck a personal chord: as someone going through the college experience and struggling to find my own place in the world, with others, I found myself deeply connected to the book and to the experiences that both Emma and Dexter went through. I can't even call it a tear-jerker, because that's doing it a disservice.<br />All in all, 10/10, highly recommend. Nicholls is a writer that knows how to show, and not tell, and for it, this book really thrives.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a great game and so easy to play. I like the detail on the graphics and how it creates a windy situation to make it challenging to shoot.

B003G4W49C|5.0|It was one of the best books I have ever read. It had a complex story line and was some times a little hard to fallow but none the less a good book. Any one who likes action adventure and si-fi would love this book as I have.
B00D2CYV9E|1.0|This movie didn't work and had to get a second copy.  Upon receiving this second copy it was worse then the first copy.  It wouldn't even start.  It is a shame that this kind of product was sent out.  I had so looking forward to seeing this and now I wouldn't waste a dime on the dvd.

B00B52F278|5.0|It's a good end. I mean its never ideal when the tragic events that can occur do occur but over all Liam picked it up well and played it out. The biggest tragedy is that he is terrible when it comes to the more promiscious scenes. He's a warrior and Andy was both. Still good.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a great book that helps sort the chaos of large quantities of diverse work affecting both development and IT. It's infectious too. Once you read it you'll be off trying to implement it and give copies to the people you work for. bravo!
B00E9PVFHE|1.0|I saw the original movie and it was much much better than this one. The one I saw was a BBC original and was tremendously better. I only rented this one because of Rachel and was disappointed.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick writes about a genius who persevered through great adversity and contributed so much for humanity with very little recognition.  Nikola Tesla tapped into the wisdom of the universe that most people do not recognize.  George Westinghouse was the only one who believed in his ability to visualize and create and when the big moguls of Wall Street led him to bankruptcy Nikola Tesla graciously forgave his debt to him.  Not only did he receive his creativity from the powers of the universe, but he also realized how unimportant materialistic rewards and notoriety are in this life.  It is sad how few people I talk to know who Nikola Tesla was or what he did.  I encourage everyone to read Sean Patrick's book about Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man that Invented the 20th Century
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Was pleasently surprised with this game. Easy when it needed to be and intricate elsewhere. It was a very beautiful game and very well crafted, but it was a little short for my liking.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|The casting is well done in this adaptation.  So many familiar faces, you know you're in good hands and the performances will be top notch. The rapport between Emma and Mr. Knightly is lovely - very realistic, Garai's Emma has youth's enthusiasm and privilege's arrogance to instruct others, but still be adorable, while Miller's condescension and exasperation barely mask his affection for her. You cannot help but smile at their bantering and a lot of it is due to his genuine frustration at, but patient tolerance for, her actions.  Michael Gambon's portrayal as the fear-filled father is delightful.  It might be flying into the face of tradition, but Mr. Knightly is quickly passing Mr. Darcy as my favorite Austen romantic hero.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game alot. It is very addicting. My boyfriend and i compete on our kindles. I highly recommend this game but be aware.  Its addicting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the game a lot I do wish they would change the way to get the special moves, I don't want to spend my money on a game such as this.. it would be better if they would give them out when we are the number one scorer for each level that would also make it even more competitive in my opinion.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Her best since The Secret History.  An 700-page door-stop, but great on the Kindle.  Her depiction of NYC is spot-on, and she brings well-developed characters.  Very emotional for a reader.
B00FVZJYK6|4.0|too much money, for 24 hrs, but it is what the grandkids wanted.  Regular price or even double rental would have been acceptable, 4 times the amount???
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a great book for those of us that love the wild bad boys and dream about having that bad boy in our life. Travis is crazy, impulsive, and just out of control when it comes to Abby and I just love it! I would recommend this book for those that want a different type of romance novel that includes not only your typical romance but unique climatic plot aspects as well.

B000FA675C|5.0|this was the first Dan Brown book I'd read.  I read it years ago in hard cover form.  What I didn't realize was that this was #2 of the Robert Langdon books.  I immediately rushed out and secured a copy of Angels and Demons which in book form was equal to or better than this..  The movie version of Da Vinci was better than the movie version of Angels however.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Tried other solitaire games and prefer this one by far.  highly recommend this one for almost any level player.<br />thanks
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun but it's boring too a little. Buts that's my opinion. I would recommend for u to play this game and see how u like it.
B0055SWM08|1.0|I was looking forward to trying this game, but it refuses to open. When I try to open, it takes me to a loading screen for about 30 seconds before closing and kicking me back to my homescreen.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, but to no avail. I have an HTC Incredible 4G, which is not the nicest phone, but I've never had an app refuse to open.

B004A8ZX2I|2.0|WARNING:Spoilers all the way down. If you insist on watching the movie, read the first sentence and stop.<br /><br />Liam Neeson can act, so what's he doing in this schlock?  The last time I saw him and Aidan Quinn at odds was in \\"Michael Collins,\\" not the most historically reliable of movies, but a heck of a lot better than this.  Quite a bit of the movie is taken up with two car chases, and that's not counting the car ride that ends up with the taxi in the river.  OK -- it's a clever premise -- the hit man who loses his sense of who he is after an accident to the extent of forgetting he's a hit man -- and then causing all sorts of trouble for his backup.  AND, when he does finally remember who he is, he tries to do the right thing, presumably because he's appalled at the damage he has already caused (several corpses) and because he has had the good fortune to meet an honest illegal alien taxi driver (female, pretty) who has shown herself willing to help him at a time when he didn't know who he was.  Then there's suspense: will his backups manage to carry out the hit?  Oh, and there's a bomb timed to go off at a crucial moment . . .  Yes it's a mess, but it's the kind of mess that can be made only by slick action-movie makers and decent actors who feel they have to do this kind of thing.  But do they . . . really?  Come on, Liam.  Get back to some worthwhile movies.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I need help with some levels though. P.S. what is that dude on the home screen?!?! Goodness gracious!!  Eww!<br />Why would you put that on there?
B00CE03UOC|1.0|Spyware and adware and nagware and not much else. Yet another circuit game that brings nothing new to the table, tries to IAP sell you hints constantly and spams your friends.<br /><br />Pathetic.<br /><br />And NO, You do not want to just buy this while it is the \\"free app of the day\\" in the hopes that it gets better because the developer will still get paid if you do<br /><br />Do not reward them!<br /><br />Developers like this need to go away, now. How they can justify their own existence and sleep at night is beyond me.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is neat. I love how you can achieve new things. The only problem I have with it is that it gets a little boring.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|An overall great game. The fact that this game is not only an app, but free, makes it better than the previous others. However, I wish there would be more to do in game for free.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The story continues.  And it continues to be as well written as the first two in the series.  I'm hooked and will read all the books in the series.
B00CX7TOTQ|2.0|I have problems with a movie set in Appalachia which was filmed not only in Georgia USA but in Bulgaria. The shifting landscapes to me too obvious and were jarring. So whatever authenticity remained in the film was not enough for me to overcome this handicap.<br /><br />Second, John Travolta as a Serb is asking a bit much. Why not cast an English-speaking Slav for the role? Most of the time I was admiring how well Travolta's accent sounded Serbian, but how would I know? I have never met a Serb.<br /><br />Finally, for the aging DeNiro to provide a credible physical adversary for someone much younger and larger was a bridge too far.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Great songs, originally mixed too hot have been given new life.  Great job.  It is like getting a new Rush Studio release.
B0015RB72W|5.0|This is a beautiful record from the first to the last cut. The vynil is excellent quality. Musically, the arrangements are very beautiful and creative. Duffy's delivery is perfect. The quality of the sound is terrific.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Moving story, great music, excellent characters. Recommended for any audience other than 5 and under.<br />warrants multiple viewings. Good stuff.
B00CBFU8YU|3.0|The music is great, but the sound is awful. (Vynil edition) Bublé´s voice sounds annoyingly &#34;auto-tuned&#34; in more than one occasion. The sound of the duo with Reese Witherspoon in &#34;Something Stupid&#34; is sub-standard. I compared it to the 1,965 mono 45 r.p.m. record by the Sinatras, and though the arrangement is the same, the warmth and the clarity of the recording is way better in the old record.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Interesting as I have been considering doing some electronic publishing.

014312093X|5.0|Not for the cursory reader, this book presents an enigmatic quest by that least dashing of protagonists, Mr. George Smiley, late of the Circus (SIS). The reader is dropped, as in other LeCarre novels, into the middle of the story, and must piece together the story from Smiley’s own memories and those of others who, in one way or another have been exiled from their life’s work. Gradually, Smiley finds that the promotion of an incompetent to the leadership of the service, and the banishment of those who were on the trail of the Soviet ‘mole’ is not merely bureaucratic ineptitude, but the result of an ingenious and sinister conspiracy run by Smiley’s nemesis, the Soviet spymaster Karla.<br /><br />This book is on my short list of yearly re-reads. It now feels as though the spy world LeCarre constructs is more the scaffolding for an unsparing examination of human betrayal in its many forms. Romantic, marital, parental, institutional and governmental structures all corrode from the vanity and ambition of the protagonists. LeCarre knows from brutal personal experience the cunning ambition at play in the upper levels of a government agency, and depicts it with an unsparing eye. He is respectful of his readers in simply presenting well rounded, often eccentric and very human characters and watching their actions without judgment. Characters tenuously holding on to their probity are the ones most used and discarded.<br /><br />The recent film, while admirable, simply hasn’t the time to do justice to the varying motivations of the suspects under Smiley’s scrutiny. Here, each gets a finely drawn portrait of resentment, class-consciousness, ambition and ruthlessness. When the mole is finally unmasked he presents an incoherent apologia of ideology and ego, in which he becomes more opaque than before. We see that far from the heroic but misguided figure we understood him to be, he has been skillfully manipulated from afar for decades, and has no remaining core.<br /><br />I find the character of Jim Prideaux most intriguing, though his inner life remains a mystery. Always the loyal soldier, he willingly heads off on what is likely a suicide mission, though attempting to warn his colleagues of the danger it poses to the regime. He represents one approach to dealing with betrayal, through feigned toughness unable to mask a wounded, gentle heart. I was touched by the patient tenderness with which he deals with the young student who idolizes him. Nonetheless he retains the capacity to snap the neck of his betrayer.<br /><br />I once knew a prominent artist who insisted that the rot of governments ultimately trickles down to poison the relations between individuals and within families. LeCarre's Cold War England embodies that notion. This is finally a melancholy and dispirited tale, one that has held me in its grip through many years.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Very important film about the problem of alcoholism in our society and how everyone can be affected by it. Denzel Washington manages to portray the delirius state of an alcoholic very believable.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Gorgeous album from one of the best in Pop music. It almost goes back to their first - Felt Mountain. Beautiful, serene, thoughtful music impeccably written, recorded and arranged! Highly recommend!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The challenges are easy and touch. I enjoy each level and look forward to more. It makes you think and then laugh at the clever challenges and links.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is not afraid to play with the big boys.  Plenty of seasoned actors and a slew of dynamic relationship building coupled with witty comedy that really drove this home for me.  You won't be disappointed!
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|Uh, well, um. I like action, I like raw crazy action with great special effects that numb a guys mind. But this movie, meh.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|If you only have enough money for 1...this is THE ONE.  Excellent compilation of their songs, can't get any better.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As a Gen X and fan of Sci fi this is a fantastic reboot. Details abound to make even the most hardcore Trekkie enjoy. This movie does well to inspire fat Trekkie fans of yesteryear to become physically fit in order not to embarrass themselves wearing red shirts of this reboot.<br /><br />All previous TV series will gently fit into this story line without compromise. The Next Generation movies with the old cast can be thrown in the trash.<br /><br />JJ will take control and own this story board for the next 20 years and create a whole new generation of Sci fi fans from a failed 80s attempt of moviemaking. My 11 yo will be the next gen growing up under Star Trek.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy continues to play with a love for the blues.  I can feel the wind in Chicago when I'm listinin to this.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Zombie training. Leaves the audience the ability to fathom a prequel and a sequel. Takes Zombie training and what we know and does not go overboard. Surviving plane crash, a lil over the top but otherwise pretty good. Action now, story is there.
B00F5I344G|5.0|The Mule is kickin it!  Plus great guest stars on 2nd set.  this rocks in the Harley stereo cruising down the road.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Thor was one of my main heroes growing up. Will order Thor II also. I recommend it.
B00G3HSF7O|1.0|purchase only? NO Rental? Sorry this film might be worth 3.99 for 2 days but is NOT worth 14.99 for a first time viewing.
B005SCSL56|4.0|I myself really enjoyed this story. But as a first book of course it would have some flaws. The biggest problem to me is that the word \\"said\\" is used after each line of speech. I think the word asked, explained, exclaimed, screamed, or replied should have been put in there a little more. Other than that, I thought this was a great first book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|great book I loved it, typical john grisham style surprises at the end, worth reading and would strongly recommend reading
B009XIXVU6|1.0|This book was rather disjointed and didn't really come together at the end.  His previous books were better and I enjoyed them more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|been playing for about a year and this is the most frustrating but addictive game I've ever played! absolutely love it!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I recently went to an MGMT concert and after seeing them, I adored them. I decided it was about time I buy a CD of theirs and this one's price was unbeatable. It arrived a day earlier than expected, and I can't wait to jam in my car!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Fun game but the time limit is really annoying. I'm finding that after a certain number of rounds you're then locked out from playing for 30 minutes, unless you pay to continue.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  Its fun and at times hard and frustrating, but you want to keep playing.  Its good for times when you dont have a lot of time because each section you play isn't real long.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|With the latest update I've exchanged emails about missing music that the other apps have no problem finding.  In the cloud, the app still can't find some of my son's and had to go through the process of downloading them one at a time all over again.  See where I work they won't allow us access to the cloud so having songs on my S3 is important to have my music on my device.  Amazons update has lost 500 songs that I can't play.<br />When I contacted Amazon they said clear<br />cache. When that didn't work they said to refresh the cloud.  When that didn't work they said uninstall and reinstall.  Now they want me to call them and troubleshoot the app problem with them.<br />Um excuse me but it id your app that has the problem, not me. I don't have time to sit on the phone and troubleshoot your bad app that keeps crashing, wants $24.99 a year to store my music when there are others out there that are free
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent!!! One of the best books I have read in a long time! See for yourself! You won't be disappointed!
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I purchased the AMD A4-5300 APU for a home theater PC build which I was doing.  I wanted a chip which had good CPU and GPU performance and at a low price point.  If you desire quantifiable results in power draw vs. performance this review is not the place.  I will expand upon my experience though.<br /><br />As a HTPC chip this is a great option, in fact it is probably a little overpowered for probably most HTPC systems.  I run XMBC and have been able to play any and every form of media from DVDs to 3D HD content.  As a by product of using this processor I have been able to use my HTPC for gaming.  I've been pleasantly surprised at the gaming performance which is offered by this low cost CPU/GPU.  I have personally played Hitman Absolution, Ages of Empires HD, and Dishonored on this HTPC.
B001AKTZPK|5.0|I have always liked Creedence Clearwater Revival. This album or CD is one of their best. I really like Fortunate Son, Cotton Fields and It came out of the Sky. A very good buy.
B00G91WB3S|1.0|So disappointing. I hoped the changes would be awesome, but what a waste of my time and money.<br />The start and the flashbacks were good, but the fight scenes and how quick Lois found the Kents....and who in their right mind would let a civilian arm a bomb for the military. Then you kill of the top scientist,  Dr Hamilton, who is key to the whole DC universe story line.<br />This movie stinks, wish I could rate it worse.
B00026WU64|5.0|I always have liked Bob Dylan, he is a tremendous singer and poet song writer. He has some very excellent lyrics and music.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|It was a good movie!<br />Great Special Effects!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun for everyone!!! It is good for everyone from my 3 year ole to me and my wife! I highly recommend it!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product. Great compliment to my Roku. Does everything I would want. Very easy to set up although I did have some issues setting up my second one. But if you have ever configured something to work on wifi it is nothing hard to get through. I highly recommend this.

B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This is an extremely fun game that is more than realistic! It is a great racing game that is good for everyone. I love it and it is one of the best games on my kindle! I would highly recommend this game to anyone!
B00E8AVNAE|5.0|Not a bad Movie....Great Special Effects!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I've always enjoyed Mr. Grisham's books and this one is another that was well worth reading.  The only thing different and the only negative comment I can say is that with this one was the plot twist normally associated with his books never really materialized for me.  That being said it was a good read with a good story that was satisfying in the end.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|Outstanding Movie!<br />Great Special Effects!<br />Buy It...You will be glad you did!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just love this show!  There are so many great characters, you never know where the story is going and whom it will involve.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Outstanding Movie!<br />Great Special Effects!<br />Buy It...You will be glad you did!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The story kept me captivated. John Grisham's storytelling can add mystery to anything. A story about a contested will that incorporates issues such as racism and greed is a true page turner.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Great Special Effects!<br />Hard to follow at first...but the 2nd time we watched it, it got better!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I decided I would post a review for this app. just for the sole purpose of getting the information front and center, for all u Kindle owners, or would be owners......<br />I was just running through some of the 100+ reviews for this application, and found that over half of them were one star. Due to the lack of love, this developer choose to shine on the kindle trolls. It seems apparent to me that none of the purchasers of this application bothered with taking 30 seconds to scroll through just a hand full of reviews, or they would quickly come to the realization that, &amp;#34;THIS APP DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY WITH KINDLE BRANDED DEVICES!!!&amp;#34; Thank You, have a nice day! BYE! BYE! NOW.......
B00CHVJODE|5.0|GREAT Movie!<br />GREAT Special Effects!<br />Buy It...You will be glad you did!<br />I am an adult and loved it, but the kids will love it too!
B00464AVXW|5.0|Very well written, and great actors, for anyone who likes these kind of movies, this is a must see.  I don't keep many movies in my library, but this is a keeper.
B005LAII44|5.0|Outstanding Movie!<br />Great Special Effects!<br />Buy It...You will be glad you did!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good challenge every time i try it.  Lots of levels to keep your interest and it never gets old.  I wish it didnt charge money as often but it keeps sucking me in.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app couldn't be installed on my Kindle Fire. So I'm not using it. It's in &#34;the Cloud&#34;.Oops. Sorry. Maybe I didn't need this after all.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Fun romp with typical stereotypes of all knowing youths assuming the worst of unsuspecting middle aged persons.  Depicts a group of College Preppies going out to the woods and being stupid and doing some of the dumbest things in response to their preconceived notions which are derived from a horror story.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I will keep this short and simple.  This movie is has moments.  If you blink slowly the moments will fuse together and you have a good movie.  If you blink in a normal fashion, you will get bored and go to the fridge at lease 7 times during the movie.  You will not care to pause it in fear of missing nothing.  Your brain has already giving you the beginning, middle and end of the movie, so you're going through the motions. So if you cannot find ANYTHING else, watch this movie.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Typical Tom Cruise glorified action, but story line sells the movie much better than Tom's acting or lack there-of.  Action movie actors need to learn how to do more than just recite the lines, of course, maybe that is how they talk in real life too.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|In a nutshell, this movie was a nice twist on the other movies before it.  You get allot of back story on Clark Kent growing up.  Since I don't do spoilers I will type this.  I am a Christopher Reeves Fan and he will always be the REAL Superman.  Henry Cavill does a great job and looks the part.  However, I would like to point out one thing that I missed.  HUMOR!  It was way to serious for me.  I miss the Margot Kidder's Lois Lane Nobel seeking antics, the comic one liners and comebacks.  Don't get me wrong I understand what they were doing,  I feel it was just missing that element.  If you are one for flashbacks,  you will be a happy camper.  There are allot of flashbacks so get ready to pay attention.  GOOD job Henry, I do look forward to you keep the &#34;S&#34; on your chest!
B00G32QIEG|1.0|The movie was predictable and boring.... I couldn't even finish watching the climax. Jeff still did a good job always.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A wonderful beginning to what shall invariably turn out to be  great series. Filled with an appropriate amount of adventure, plot twists, suspense, and political intrigue.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I like the game. Like all &quot;freemium&quot; games, the in your face IAP can be a little annoying, but once you get past that it's good. I hear some people claim to hit a paywall around level 15 or so, but I haven't had any issues yet. I also made it through the warmages academy, one of the more supposedly difficult areas without difficulty.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This game was working pretty well until he last few weeks. My striped candy stopped clearing the whole line. Then the background turned black and I can't see any jelly and now it force closes all the time. It won't even let me get to the game play. What happened?
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Best book I've read this year! Purchased 15 to give away for Christmas.  Great advice and easy reading. Recommend it to everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just so...AMAZING. you get to play at different places. You can play as different minions. This game is so worth it . Try it!
B007TK77QE|2.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan I was definitely disappointed in this book. It makes for an extremely depressing read. Everything that can go wrong seems to go wrong with the inhabitants of Pagford. It is extremely unrealistic. No one town can have so much bad luck. I think JK Rowling should stick to writing children's books.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a fun and good game I recommend this games to anyone who likes to build, and likes addictive games.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Interesting and not too hard to learn & getting it for 99 cents is a bargain Would recommend it to a friend
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I really like this game. It's fun fast paced. Only one problem.... IT GETS OLD, once you get all the cars and upgrade them. It gets boring and repetitive. I first got rid of it because of that. The was what? A couple months ago. And im like they should of updated it by now... So I bought it. And found out... NO UPDATE. And im disappointed. But really fun game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Great writing &style. Recommend it without any reservations. Probably a good movie but can't be as good as book.
B00594XOZU|2.0|BUT What happened to it why is it unavailable and why did u put on l ok shake to find people for oil but you took away kik please bring it back I freaking love this app but I can't go on it on here please fix it :c
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I received this movie quickly after it was bought and it was cheaper then all of the local stores for price, which is one reason i love shopping on amazon! The DVD was packaged very well and there were no issues with the discs and the dvd's work perfectly. I love this series and it was another great movie!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love the game but it only downloads to level 440 and i am on 471 so I hope the Candy Crush Saga team will make updates for the new level to the kindle fire soon!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry birds are always a good choice and who doesn't love specialty angry birds. My 8 year old son loves this app as well and it is easy enough that we even have grandpa playing it! All the way around its a good app, it's free, it's fun, and it's easy!
B0091THDOM|5.0|The cover could have been better by giving a headphone slot at the bottom. The cover should be a little larger than the phone so that the phone doesn't touch the ground in case of accidental falls.<br /><br />Otherwise I love the product and the materials its made of. I love the quality and feel of the product.<br />I would recommend it highly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's addicting and fun get the app as soon u can get it get it get it get it<br /><br />On
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This app is amazing. There are tons of apps I edited using this app. From removing blemishes to adjusting the brightness, this app can make photos look flawless.<br /><br />The reason I gave this app 4 stars is, because of the fact that the app does not give you the option to make a collage with your photos. I was very disappointed when I could not find that feature. Perhaps I have not discovered it.<br /><br />Overall, this is an amazing app!
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|these people keep violating my privacy settings and giving or displaying my details even when I say or changed my settings to not to.
B00DJYJPLO|2.0|I LOVE the first two movies in this series and I've watched them many times. But this movie left me feeling totally unfulfilled and just plain bored. Gone is the magic, the romance, and the wonderful undercurrent of discovery that the first two movies have for me. There are other people in the movie (besides Celine and Jessie) that I really don't care about and I always wanted them to go away so the movie could get back to the two people I came to know and love. However, these two people I love are not so loveable anymore; especially Celine who is now very annoying in her bickering and cynicism. I'll stick with watching the first two movies and pretend I never saw this one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Netflix works flawless and same goes for YouTube and Play Music. It's so easy to use that even grandpa can watch Netflix on TV by using tablet and Chromecast.
B00G1D8926|2.0|A good effort on an important subject, but over all a dull film.  Still, I learned several things from it about Hannah Arendt and the public's reaction to her book on the Nuremberg Trials.
B00BSB2AE4|3.0|I wish there was more original content. This was unfortunately just the blog repackaged in book form. I still would buy the book again to support her, but very disappointing.
B004I744AS|4.0|Very handy app to use when other apps do not have an embedded dictionary. What I use most on a day to day basis is hangperson...I am politically correct to the point of nausea.
020530902X|5.0|Unfortunately, I found out about this book in my third year of law school, and think that every law student should have it in their back pocket at all times. (Note: this comment shall not reflect my knowledge learned from the book.) BUY IT!!
B003L77G6A|5.0|great for a laugh - easy to relate, especially relate if you have someone in your family with aspergers syndrome!
B008JFURII|5.0|A REAL GOOD MOVIE! THERE ARE TWISTS AND TURNS AROUND EVERY CORNER! IT'S A REAL GOOD CHOICE! JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU FIGURED IT OUT, YOU'LL BE SURPRISED!
B00BDAP66E|4.0|Works great but need an update. Can't share your pics posted over can't tag people in the comments who have commented on the list. Can do all this from my phone. Everyone I get on the app from my kindle it asked to update and there is no update for it.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Very good program for viewing, editing and creating documents in the mobile environment.  Easy to install and use on Samsung GS 3.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is fun and addictive. Great way to pass the time, but warning, it will consume you! Can't put it down.
B004SBX112|4.0|Don't want to give Angry Birds a bad review cause I love all the games! This problem probably had to do with Amazon App store. 11/30/2013 App store shows an update for this version of Angry Birds Seasons but I have tried twice and it won't update! Guess I'll check the free version.
B00F35BV64|1.0|I cannot watch this movie.  I have contacted Amazon several times about this.  Amazon has not provided any assistance to resolve the problem.  At this point I just want my money refunded.  Thank you.
B00G21YLF6|1.0|With all respect to the series, someone is getting greedy charging three and a half times an episode for this.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|it does not play on my old regular DVD player nor my new blu-ray one. Maybe I just got a bad one here.<br />Of course it is a pain to pack up and return. Bummer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome<br />Best game ever can not put it down.<br />So good I could play it forever as long as I live.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game :) Great for all ages especially if your a horse lover :D You have to wait to replenish the energy you use but that's just the nature of these games. It's still great to play.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I first heard of this book from Danisnotonfire and it kicked me straight in the feels (thanks Dan).<br />Well played, John green.<br />Well played.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game because it is not as easy as it would seem. It keeps you thinking. It is very addictive game.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Ok movie story...Good acting.<br />one time watch movie.<br />Some stuff seems very unreal.<br />If Pilots can drink and drive then thats crazy...
B00CF2UORK|5.0|This remains one of the most brilliantly imagined and crafted animated series we've ever seen.  Perfect for grade-school kids and adults. If you don't laugh watching these episodes, some evil doctor removed your funny bone while you slept.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|This watch is very classy looking and holds time well. You should not put it in water even though it says is 20 atms, an atm is 33ft in depth . I broke mine by hitting one of my friends and it shattered. the reason it is four stars is because it did what it said it would do and looked good. It has a stop watch on it and the number of days. It was big when I got it but Wal-Mart took out links for free. It is a great watch.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Loved this book!!!!  Found myself not wanting to put it down, and can't wait to read the other installments.  It's an easy read, and the story moves along pretty easily.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|I love this movie. I believe that there is more to Kennedy's assassination that the government is hiding. Its really a shame we cant trust the leaders of our country.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|By the game it says free but inside the game are things u have to pay for and this game actually has 136 games but other than that it is awesome!!!!!!!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie popped up out of nowhere.  It's not your standard Hollywood variety but based on a real story that really gets your heart string tugging.<br />The acting is superb, the setting and the story telling second to none.<br />By now I'm sure most people have either seen or at least heard of this movie.  If not then you grab a copy, sit and watch.  An enthralling tale that is family friendly and something you will watch over and over.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Great movie if you like British offerings.  It will remind you of &#34;Downton  Abbey.&#34;  Helen Mirren is wonderful, as always
0375507256|5.0|Not optimism, pessimism, or fatalism, but the power of assertion ultimately animates Cloud Atlas: we cannot have the world we wish for unless we assert it and call it into being. First the narrative migrates through the centuries on six connected, but unfinished stories: a murderous sea-passage; the travails of an adolescent artist; a daring nuclear intrigue; the absurd crumbling of a mostly wasted life; a sick and deluded future; and finally a renaissance of brutality, with shades of redemption. Then the narrative returns the way it came. As it slips backward in time to complete each of the stories, bare survival passes through stoic martyrdom, trite recovery, uneasy repose, the release of death, and, finally, the equipoise of rebirth and a bold new assertion.<br /><br />Because violence, malice, greed, and inhumanity permeate all six stories despite the efforts of the protagonists in every one, and despite the hints that each might be making a difference for the next, one could easily read Cloud Atlas as a dire indictment of humanity as a race indelibly marked with evil. But one would have to ignore the structure of the narrative; to achieve that pessimistic effect, each of the six stories might just be told in full, one right after the other. They are not, however, and the bold assertion in the final pages suggests a different effect, that the futures we've seen are not what will be, but what might be. And the hints repeated throughout the book, that each of the six stories is affected with half-truths and elaborations, reinforce that impression: not only are the narrators unreliable, but also the redactor. Together, the six stories of Cloud Atlas form not the account of a unitary fictional past and future, like a quasi-historical fantasy on the transmigration of souls, but an agglomeration of themes consciously spread across different fictions to illustrate an idea: that we live in worlds shaped by the stories that others have told, and the assertions that others have made, but retain the underlying freedom, as did those others, to tell our own stories, make our own assertions, and shape our own world.<br /><br />This book is a complex web of styles, forms, and themes. The different styles of writing, from past to future, suggest the changing uses of words, and the ways in which our understanding of the world is limited by the categories of our language, and prompts reflection on the forgotten histories embedded in the words we use every day. The cycle of forms through which the narrative passes--diary, letters, thriller, memoir, interview, and campfire yarn--marks out different ways of building a world out of stories. And the relation between author and reader is shifted along its own chiastic pattern, creating parallels of its own: diary and memory; letters and interview; thriller and memoir. Or: constitution of self, communication to other, and establishment of genre. Are these modes of storytelling also progressively more restrictive? Should we be surprised that human history, as depicted in the contents of the stories, appears to reach a troublesome tipping point in the generic stories? Freedom and slavery, capture and captivity, are major themes in each of the six stories, as is the idea that captors are, in their way, slaves to the duality, which perpetuates itself, and devours itself, by reification. In this way form and style align with theme in Cloud Atlas, so that the people most like us, closest to our time, and the most decadent, are rendered in the stories that most closely adhere to standard fictional styles. We constitute ourselves; we are the fictions. And if Cloud Atlas seems also to be literary criticism disguised as a novel, there is the next layer. If we create our own world by assertion, and construct ourselves into fictions, then are we not free to escape the confines of genre and convention?<br /><br />There are characters, too, piles of them in each of the six stories. Even the ones that are drawnmostly on the periphery, like poor, brilliant, straight-shooting Rufus Sixsmith, the deliciously execrable Henry Goose, the coarse thug Nurse Noakes, and the driven but enigmatic Hae-Joo Im are vivid and memorable. But here is the puzzle on main display: Are Adam Ewing, Robert Frobisher, Luisa Rey, Timothy Cavendish, Sonmi-451, and Meronym all reincarnations of the same person? Repeated suggestions to that effect are undercut by several expressions of skepticism, and the fact that all six of them are deeply unique, having not much in common except a birthmark and experiences with oppression, captivity, slavery, or some form of entrapment. Frobisher cannot get over himself while Cavendish deprecates himself; Rey cannot imagine herself as anyone but the hero, while Meronym only reluctantly comes to that role; Sonmi is born into slavery while Ewing is born into privilege. And there are plenty more differences. This is not a metaphysical reincarnation of souls, but a metaphorical reinforcement of the common humanity of disparate individuals.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a strange book, but brilliantly evocative on a singular theme in many variations: we are all storytellers, and that gives us the capacity to be free.
0452295548|5.0|A clear description of a stroke from the unique (and personal) viewpoint of a brain scientist who experienced a severe stroke.  If you know anyone who has had a stroke, this is a helpful book for understanding what the person is going through and learn ways that you can help through better clarity and comprehension.  There are many, many books on stroke out there, and many of them are good, but this well-written book is truly a unique look from the inside of the occurrence of and recovery from a major stroke.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Its fine, just some bubble-gum for the brain. Good special effects and even a bit thought-provoking in terms of the potential widespread social impact of disasters - the degree to which the government can or will help, mob psychology and looting, etc.
030758836X|4.0|In true Gillian Flynn fashion this is another twisted tale. For me nothing she has written has measured up to her first novel, Sharp Objects but each has been increasingly disturbing. Flynn has a knack for weaving tales without letting the reader know exactly what is going on until the end and this is no exception. Her novels leave you feeling unnerved, which is no small feat. I won't leave any spoilers, but I will say whatever you do, do not skip ahead pages, don't even fan through the pages you will ruin the experience for yourself.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|Great movie! Funny story, delightful characters (even the bad guys) and Jennifer Anniston is hotttttt doing her strip tease. However a &#34;tease&#34; is all it is, she even wears a thong under her underwear! :-/<br />Contrast that excessive modest with the gratuitous disregard for modest when it comes to the male anatomy - A teenage boy's swollen genitals are clearly shown for a length scene, what a double standard!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Tons of fun. Not too hard but enough of a challenge to keep me interested. Still playing it and will definitely seek more games by this producer.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Nicely organized and paced. the character development is pretty good. the language and dialog definitely make it a teen novel.<br /><br />But considering the selections of dribble being produced for teens, this one really stands out.
B0063M22QO|5.0|The patterns keep changing each time, so it doesn't get boring as some other apps do. Keeps one on their toes.
B00GT67UUM|5.0|If you enjoy thinking and not on the speed of your fingers moving about this is one is for you.  It will  help keep the cogs moving in your mind. :0) the game is very nicely done, hats off to them.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Overall, this is a pretty good superhero movie.  It is a tad annoying that they start out fighting with each other, but then they pull together at the end and triumph.  Decent acting and great effects, with a nice touch of humor.  Not a classic, but enjoyable.  The short scene between Loki and Hulk is a high point.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Nice ending to the series.<br />Action packed and kept me guessing.<br />Wish there was more to read!<br />Nice ending where everything comes full circle.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|I really love this album.  Wish it was the 25th with the Valjean Quartet.  Its a LOT better than the movie sound track.  I love the movie but is miss have some great singing performances.  I fell in love with the songs and want them to be superior like the stage ones.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|I find I need to lift my head towards the visor so the speaker can hear me correctly. I changed its position to see if it made a difference. Not really.  It repeats my command back to me, but incorrectly. Maybe I'll try putting it on my collar!  2 funny ;-)
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|the game is great it works perfect for my device and I just love this game its free that's my favorite job for a free game they did good on everything.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I LOVE this game, and I love the movie,but I don't like the battle pass thing. Other than that, perfect. Take away the passes, and I will give it 5 Stars
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Great special effects and all that----the wife is pathetic and it seems until their very existence is being threatened, she abandons her beliefs for survival. Would have been a better movie without her and the kids or maybe if their roll was different, without the touchy, feely stuff. On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this movie a 5, based mostly on the Military's commitment and Israel.<br />Incidentally--starting with Piers Morgan (bad), then having Guns save everyone is hypocritical on his part; I know it's only a movie, but seems to me he would practice what he preaches if he truly believes ---what a pathetic person. Again and abandonment of core beliefs for survival, in his case --MONEY!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|For introducing me to these amazing books..If it weren't for you.. I would have missed out..Thank you my Shadow..my amazing daughter
B005LN5UOC|5.0|Very comfortable and great talk time. I like how easy it is to mute, and having the volume control is great for when people scream at each other in online games
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I truly enjoyed this game. There are many twists and turns and a lot of items to collect. I would easily recommend this game to my friends.
0060934913|5.0|Hilarious inside view of the culture behind America's eateries. Good culinary advice thrown in.  Bourdain gives you his best take on managing people and processes in the restaurant business.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Haven't used it enough to give it a higher rating.  I'm sure that along with everything else about the Kindle, it is reliable.
B002J2PB10|5.0|Death proof was an insane movie and full of action. Quentin Tarantino is wierd and if you like his movies you should watch this.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very enjoyable.  I have become so addicted that I use up my battery life before I am aware that I have little or no life left.
0316017930|5.0|i loved the book and it was in great condition. Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. He will get you inspired to make the best of yourself.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is the best game and it is great for all ages  and I recommend it for all ages including all of the adult
B002MG2ATY|5.0|You can learn this history the hard way, like I and many others have, by reading thousands of pages of the hard work of unpaid investigators seeking the truth.  Or, you can watch JFK and come away with a basic but much more accurate understanding of the &#34;why&#34; of the assassinations of JFK, MLK and RFK then you have ever been offered by our military and corporate masters.<br /> I watched this when it came out, but now after reading tens of thousands of pages of related history, I appreciate it much more deeply than I did at first viewing.  Garrison's contention that the forces of &#34;Fascism&#34; were essentially those behind this coup ring true to this very day and hold current relevance.  Our military/intelligence/corporate/media masters would prefer we spend our time guessing who will be voted off the island or labeled the latest singing sensation as we pretend &#34;reality TV&#34; is actually &#34;real.&#34;  The time you spend watching JFK will re-ground you in &#34;reality&#34; in a way that just might leave you questioning everything you think is &#34;real.&#34;  It is a work of art based in a history that our leaders hope we never learn, and never hold them accountable for.  It is up to us to prove them mistaken.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is soo fun! all my freinds now play it also. For the kindle its slow on the updates, kindle only has 5 regions and apple products have 6. PLEASE FIX THIS! and also kindle cant do the holiday or club hunts either..... FIX THIS TOO! anyway, MAJOR FUN GAME!! I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH!!! It also crashes ALOT! but the quality, graphics, and funness make up for it. :) Definetly download!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Many combinations of sounds to suit any mood. I like to layer the many soothing water sounds for peaceful relaxing sleep.
0553801473|5.0|Delivers on an already strong series.  The format changed a bit from earlier books, but it was still engrossing and well written.  Can't wait for more...
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Not what you would necessarily expect from a &#34;zombie&#34; book. It is however a refreshing change that delves into some of the more mundane aspects of a zombie's life. That is not a criticism as it makes it slightly more plausible and disconcerting as a result.<br /><br />Easy to read but lacked a zing factor.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A little confusing at first as to how to play, but the game walks you through it pretty well.<br /> All in all a fun game!!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son has been playing this game for over a year now. Still loves to play with it, as if I just got it. Fun and educational!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Typical Grisham. Some twist but no big surprise. Good relaxing read plays well as a sequel. I would recommend this.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|In a world filled with unimaginative and far too image-ridden children, Lemony Snicker reminds us of the power of intelligence, hope and companionship.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|It blocks the ads not the apps. It is actually perfect and gets the job done. It just doesn't block google ads. But they rarely show.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well-written, evidence-based, honest discussion of why women do and don't succeed in life and careers. Good read for women -and men - at all stages of life and careers. Take away ideas to improve your success in accomplishing and even defining your goals, and commit to helping others achieve and better define theirs. And be nice!  And smart! And true to yourself!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|No issues with lag or anything like that. I like it a lot. It works great with my mac. The connectivity is great to, its fast and good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once started it was hard to put down. Gresham has a way to grab your imagination by adding a few twists and turns to keep you guessing. The feelings of the community the story is set in is extremely realistic along with some of the events that happen during the trial. It's also true of many human traits and faults we have with some not so good and other to be admired.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Saw them on SNL and they are great.  They have an energy and rhythm that is unique and yet highly listenable
B001TKK3O8|5.0|Fracture is a great movie, one movie I would highly recommend to anyone. Best movie I have watch in a long time and very please I did purchase this movie.
B002WY65W4|4.0|a rollicking fun zombie movie. It sets the bar very high for humor and fun. The 10 rules are good especially the first.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|if you are a big Mother Monster fan Lady Gaga fan or just thinking about getting a nice CD for a friend family coworker as a Christmas gift this is one of the best choices this album to me is the best she's ever done by who she collaborated with especially the song do with you want ft. R Kelly no matter if you want a techno beat an upbeat or slow beat she gives it to you on this album so go out and support Lady gaga aka Mother Monster with her new album art pop
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its awesome but when you sell stuff you get a s*** return on it. But it's great with everything else.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this games is so addictive I can't believe it's free right now. I would definitely recommend it free or not.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Great Movie. Shows the intelligence of these wonderful animals and the strong connection they have to family.  It is just cruel and wrong to kidnap them and make them prisoners.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I just purchase a new kindle fire. I was so happy to see that I could download candy crush on here. However I'm on level 445 and can't play it on here I have to keep using my phone or computer. Please update as soon as possible with new levels. I love the game. Rated 1 star for Kindle fire
B003JTHXOK|3.0|While I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks novels, I have to say this was not one of my favorites!  Yes, I did sit down and read the book pretty much all at once, as I do with most of his novels, however, it failed to have the &#34;THAT WAS AWESOME&#34; part at the end that I often feel as I close the book once completed.  It was a compelling story, though, I did feel it was a bit like &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy.&#34;  There were a few times in the story that I gasped, as a new part began to unravel, however, I was able to clearly depict what was going to happen before it even unfolded for much of the storyline.  I wish the book would have continued...<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  I wish that more of the story would have unfolded to say that KATIE would have been able to become ERIN again, that those who knew what Kevin was doing to her would have come clean, that Erin could have talked to the old neighbors about what happened with Katie's documents etc.  I wanted more closure, other than, Kevin is dead, let's all live happily ever after.  The whole JO part was a little odd.  While it was nice that Carly went by Jo, and that was a part I wasn't expecting, that fact that she imagined Jo to be having all these conversations with her, eating with her, though never touching her food, even yelling at her (in her own subconscious mind) was a bit of a stretch for me.  BUT, it was a decent story, but definitely enjoyed other Sparks novels better!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I got this game I thought it would stink but this game is great like it has over one hundred flighty quests
B003G4W49C|4.0|The movie was a little slow but this book held my attention throughout.  Great story and liked learning more about the sister and brother of Ender.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I would say more then it's a good book but I'm off to read the next book five out of five
B007EC27QM|5.0|Good to have the right number, accuracy is important in life and easy access is even better.  It's So great!!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Boring game no challenge no strategy required does not hold your attention removed it after playing it six times my daughter didn't like either
B0089LOG02|5.0|Compelling read and great message of hope and endurance that triumph over circumstances. Great way to intertwine two story lines
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is the most highly played and addictive game probably ever made. This is the best game ever<br />. I was looking for a new game a while back and I saw candy crush and I was so excited . Because when I would search it in the app store it said , and I quote , &quot;Currently Unavailable&quot;  I was so mad. Cause I played it on Facebook all the time. Everyone in my family plays it! Omfg Thank you so much Amazon for putting it on Kindles &lt;333333 Lots of loveee -Former Candy crush player.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the kind of mahjong I'm used to and I play it a lot.  Wish I could play it faster
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I downloaded this shortly after midnight and started playing it.  At around 2:30, I looked up and told myself I _had_ to go to bed. The controls are simple, the gameplay is intriguing, and the graphics are smooth and attractive. It reminds me of nothing so much as Myst, although it's certainly not the same game. I don't often recommend game apps to others, but I have been with this one.
0312330537|5.0|I ordered this book because I had borrowed it from a friend a few years ago but wanted to actually own it.  Glad to have it as part of my personal library.  Condition as described.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|May be biased since I love all things Joss, but it was very entertaining. It was really fun to watch my favorite Whedonverse actors do something different.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Stupid movie with bad story line and bad acting.  I can't believe it got so many good reviews.  Talk about plot holes... good grief.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun. Never thought I could get so involved in a game. This. 72 year old brain is not done yet.
B0094LUFY2|5.0|Great movie, resolution was good too. I like that I don't have to worry about storage. I can download to my kindle for no internet connection and then put back into the cloud.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It's not a movie that I would have gone to see at the theater.  However once I got into it, I got a sense that it was teaching us a lesson on the &#34;haves and have nots.&#34;  There were a number of other problems in society today that I believe it was talking about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has mad swag dude. Read it. I dare you. Suzanne Collins rules. Spoiler alert: a cat eats President Snow's testicles.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great way to learn a new language at my convenience.This is better than have to pay for  the course in school.  Fantastic.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I really enjoyed the ups and downs of this book. I could identify with Eleanor and with Park on so many different levels. Great love story. Great commentary on poverty, family, abuse and teenage love. Read this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|AWESOME. That is all I can say. I am so happy that I can play on my Kindle.  Thanks so much.
B005I4JG80|4.0|Enjoyable read. Makes one reflect even more on ones own parenting style. Would recommend this book. South African moms might resonate with this oddly enough :)
B00F2362IE|5.0|awsame but ever peorson thar whud be a mini game. or erne more mony for one ninja and more gise
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does nothing but say &#34;ready to cast&#34; All connections are right. Video's available and youtube but nothing shows on my TV. A piece of junk nicely packaged.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a 11 year old daughter and she just will play all day on my kindle.Me and my daughter will sometimes race. So get this game to have fun!!!!!!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Easy to play. I enjoy very much. Fun and interesting this is a good game to waste a lot of time if you have it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I purchased the book.  it is a good story and kept me wanting more.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Old favorite bring home old time values - importance of family being more important than work and great ideals.  Great ideals and work are great when first things are put first, but as deadly and void as any other vice when out of place.  Food for the body,not the body for food.... Great music and dance, delightful tales, will make kids and adults alike smile.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The script and acting keep the viewer completely engaged.  Each segment leaves one wanting more.  I just wish people would quit dying.
B00FQMVCEA|3.0|Honestly, I was a bit disappointed after Cars.  A lot of similarities in great animation, voices, etc, but strongly lacking in the story line.  Cars (the first one) was an amazing story with amazing and believable (as believable as talking cars can get) characterizations.  A real family story projecting the importance of humans, friendship and love as truly more valuable and long-lasting than the so empty, short lived pleasures of fame and fortune.  Cars 2 was expected to be less than Cars 1 - and it was, but it got away with a good old fashioned 007 plot, with plenty of intrigue well developed until the end when we find out who the bad guy really is - not as in depth in meaning as the first, but we survive because - the ever famous American addiction - it's interesting and funny.  In planes, however, nothing is new.  Nothing needs to be discovered - honestly, the story line was just really void of depth, reminded me of one of the 1/2 hour cartoons on kids tv.  Kids will like it, but like ever so much of food these days, the story seemed a bit full of corn syrup and additives with just enough nutrition to convince a body it might be food.....  Like candy or ramen noodle soup, a bit won't kill us and can fill a bit, but we need more meat and potatoes.
B00AHDXTIK|2.0|The Lightning end of this phone is made of bulky plastic that renders it useless if you have a case on your phone.
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|Now I'm not sure if this is a glitch. But when you steer one way the car should<br />go the way YOU steered. Right? But no. It goes the OTHER way! Bad glitch. Bad game!
B004XMMSZG|2.0|The Bluetooth reception is choppy, and it makes a high-pitched electronic whine every 30 seconds.  It is a very annoying sound and I am returning it.
0684867621|5.0|Well what can I say it's Steven King his books are just awesome can't get enough trying a buy them all.... Going to take awhile but I will get'm......
B0094K1WZE|5.0|excellent action movie stunts were spectacular acting was not to bad either. Would recommend to anyone over 11 years of age.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Excellent book in a great series and I always look forward to the next one. These two writers make such a great combo while maintaining their own solo endeavors.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|it is an awesome game but y cant play it all the time becouse of the limited powercores ... and y want to play it al the time
B00457X8BC|4.0|The Dogs of Riga is an excellent political thriller that shows what could take place in a country experiencing political and social changes.
B005NNVPOO|2.0|Some good Pink Floyd moments but pretty lame overall.  Must be heard during proper mood.  Sound quality is decent enough.
0823015017|5.0|Two of the best experts in polymer clay have presented clear explanations of techniques to achieve the colors you want in polymer clay. Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is, what I think one of the best games there is. I think this because, for me it is very time consuming.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|In view of the fact that the original Woman in Black (1989) is not available I suppose this film will have to do.  The 1989 version was far more scarier, although there are a few moments in this version that raise the hair a wee bit.  The advertisement warns not to view it alone, but nothing could be farther from the truth.  The plot, although predictable, is good if you can get by seeing &#34;Harry Potter&#34; where Daniel Radcliffe is concerned.  The scenes were shot in very dreary locations and the house is absolutely perfect for conveying the environment needed for the plot to succeed.  All of the actors were quite convincing in their respective rolls which added to the films suspense.  And I believe that the attitude and superstitions of the local villages was conveyed perfectly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing ! I just love it and I can't stop playing it! My coworkers were playing it months before I decided to finally download it! I'm glad I did
B00FLNRN06|3.0|Most of the laughs are contained in the trailer.  The rest of the movie's plot was just plain silly.  I could do without the same-sex-attraction of the DEA cop and his wife, who by the way in reality would not have let the Millers go on a charge of drug smuggling.  It is only Will Poulter's  (of &#34;Voyage of the Dawn Trader&#34; fame)  that carried the movie where hilarity is concerned; but his innuendos were not frequent enough make the film a howl.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun & exciting game.  Added this to my Kindle. Already play on my phone & my desktop computer at home.
B00AFEY354|2.0|Logan Lerman and Emma Watson drew me to this movie.  However, I don't know why we are constantly being exposed to homosexuality in nearly every film that comes out of Hollywood.  Homosexuals amount to a mere 5% of the American male population and most people find the life style offensive, particularly in films.  I had no idea that drug use was a major part of this film until I watched it.  If you like watching crazy teens at parties doing weird things to each other, then this film is for you.  It should have big &#34;PG&#34; rating applied to it for family-oriented viewers as a warning.
B005R32L66|2.0|didn't work well on my computer and I can't figure out how to get my initial $10 back. might be better on different computer
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|clean master has made my android run faster .  it works great and its free! how can you beat that! thank you clean master!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|OK here it goes one of the BEST books I have read of this kind!!!!!! To say any more would give the story away. I laughed and cried and smiled and cried tears of joy. This is a must read!!!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Awesome game love it exellent guns sounds and effects. Good for learning about ww2 guns. It is one of the must get apps.
1451695195|5.0|This is a very interesting book it bring up the subject of consciousness. A topic that nobody really knows the TRUTH about except this for A very select few like Eben who is still scratching the surface
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Game is very addicting, plenty of puzzles that start of challenging and get harder. Like the neon colors but the sound is just basic
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Overall, it's a very fun game. But unless you're ready to spend real money for coins and crowns, the thrill goes quickly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is AWESOME. The app still works even though I got the update. So I don't know what  those peeps are talking about
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of King 's best efforts. The narrative voice is unique and compelling. If you're a fan of alternative History, time-travel fiction, or of the author, I highly recommend this trip through what might have been.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it. Best I read in a long time. I recommend it to everyone I know. I love it a lot
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|meh. the quality is not as good as using a cable because netflix lags A LOT (even on my wifi which is usually very fast) however steup is very easy and it does exactly what it is advertised to do.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game , herobrine burned our world but, for the most part EPIC its  just bad with herobrine get in your world my siblings all have it ! Worth 6.99　dollars!!!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved every minute of it! This period work is entirely absorbing. Very well acted, the characters are real people a person can care about.
B0000047CX|4.0|The cool, smooth sounds are relaxing and stimulating at the same time.  Stan Getz is superb as usual and this jazzy, latin combo delivers just the right mix.  I've owned only one Getz release in the past and never owned anything by Gilberto, but the two seem to be a good fit for one another musically.  Subsequently, my 86-year-old father also owns a copy of this CD....and he got it first.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful tales of a family and those who live with them. This series is entirely absorbing, especially liked the Christmas episode.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Levels up to nine were enjoyable, but I'm really working now!  Many more colors to connect, and its not so obvious at this level.
B00CE03UOC|1.0|Unless you pony up another $3.99 AND give it your Facebook account, you don't get the full game you paid for.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the app contains these adware modules:<br />AdMob<br />AdSense<br /><br />The game itself isn't anything special; it's just yet another game where you figure out the paths from one colored dot to its partner without overlap. There are a bunch of them, most without adware, in-app-purchasing, or Facebook demands.<br /><br />Worth 99-cents without the sneaky scam and adware stuff. Not worth a nickel otherwise.<br /><br />SUMMARY: if it's the FAOTD, get it, stick it in your library, and check to see if the developer ever removes the garbage.  Otherwise avoid.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|The whole series is destroyed by the strange and incomprehensible accent of the narrator.  I'm really shocked that BBC chose such a narrator.  I bet most speakers of standard British English and standard American English don't understand his English well enough.  BBC has gone too far in its affirmative action.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|This book was raved about and received so many awards and praises. Not bad but not a book that grips you from start to finish.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is an interesting plot with lots of subtleties  ( something I did not expect).  Brace yourselves for a good time.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|This is a great movie. Everyone should have this movie. It is a tribute to the greatest martial artist ever.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have used this game to pass time while waiting for appointments and coworkers.  It is very handy for a habitually early person.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Action packed, great visual effects and music. The cast works really well together and of course who doen't like a Stan Lee cameo appearance!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a really nice magical coming of age, fantasy novel. You will join Oria, and the Ahwahnee Tribe, as they fight evil. Lots of shape-shifting fun along with other interesting magical ideas and themes. A good story that is also suitable for younger readers…
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|Just a dissapointment to use, too clunky for the price. Phone is GS4 on Sprint with android 4.3 and touchwiz
B008LMZPNG|3.0|Digital copy is Ultra Violet.  Wish it was a regular Digital Copy that would download to iPad, IPhone, or iPod.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|ON the good side: great pictures, breathtaking shots and scenes in the atmosphere an on the &#34;ruined&#34; Earth as well. Well done.<br />The problem is that these are kind of standard now, so acting and story still, or even more make a difference. After 10-15 minutes, when you get used the style (unexpected camera-angle changes and openings) and you start focusing on the story, you start to develop a sense of emptiness. Which not because of the hopeless future of Earth, as the movie suggests it, but because the story is very shallow. Without ruining the story for those who haven't seen it yet, don't expect anything unexpected, or smart. (Note: I am not a Cruise fan: ) Also, I think Cruise has been stuck on the sad no-man's land between the charming boy and the wise man (he may never get there). I don't think that showing his butts and his (okay for a man in his fifties) chest is enough to make a good movie.<br />Okay if you are tired and just want to relax and make your visual-mind-center work, but you are better of not watching it if you into sci-fi and like the intellectual part of movies.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I teach in a high school and used this film as an example to inform and educate students of the events involved with the devastation that  has recently occurred in the Philippines. It is difficult for some adolescents to imagine the grief and destruction that occurs through natural disasters. This film made it possible to do so.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love this fascinating pairing and reincarnation of characters, it's a pleasure to watch. I don't know how I didn't discover it sooner. Can't wait to see more. Must watch.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I probably chose three stars because I am not quick enough to beat this game. If you ask a five year old, I am sure it would be five stars. They can fly from track to track withoug slamming into the back of a train.
B003VANOFY|4.0|So far so good, it gets the job done in gaming and listening to music is enjoyable again. It isn't perfect, but has decent sound and bass for the price and good mic function.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game for me...now my 4 &amp; 5 year don't even let me play it is a constant battle for who gets to play minions next!
1589795474|5.0|Great book that should be a mandatory read for all.  It was recommended to me by a friend who also loved reading the book and is wealthy.  It's probably the best book I ever read and I know from personal experience it's 100% true.  Anyone who wants to deny it's contents is in denial and will always be poor and stupid.
B008EEZ64Y|1.0|I don't like this it UN clear and depressed it sort of weird and I don't like that I really don't like this book this is not Lois Lowry best work I like holes way better
B005NF2UE6|5.0|If you like classic Nickelback you'll like this one.  Recording is good quality.  Not much more to write on this except when is there next album coming? Great music.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|WONDERFUL SET OF MOVIES TO ROUND OUT THE SERIES! MAKES ME WATCH AND FALL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN! WOW!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It`s a great dictionary.<br />I love that each word has many meanings.<br />I would recommend it to every reader .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app! It is addictive, fun, fun for kids and family. They did a great job on creating this game. Have fun!!
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|An amazing movie with love , laughter, sadness , and a bad person. My two daughters who are 7 and 11 also me loved it.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Addictive although a little too easy (at least on the first 20 levels). Nice and simple graphics which is all that's needed for this sort of game
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's very entertaining I'm not that far into it but it's very addictive and I'm loving everything about it and I'm sure you will to.
B00FZMQX4K|5.0|This review is specifically about the 2013 Remix on vinyl (the one with the black cover).  Only 3 songs per side at 45 rpm so the sound just jumps off the record.  I love the mix on this record - it is just big and raw.  Scentless Apprentice (my favorite Nirvana song) is incredible - the riff in the verse sounds so dirty - in a good way - and the drums and bass just slam.  I love how you can actually hear the acoustic guitar in All Apologies - i had really never picked up on that in the original mix. The intro to Very Ape is a bit different starting with the lead guitar line I think the people that complain about this mix are just so used to hearing the regular album and it being one of their favorite albums aren't going to like any changes no matter what.  If this mix had come out in 1993 and the original mix was what released this year, people would be complaining about that.  It just flat out sounds amazing to me and made the record even more exciting.  I'm glad to have both versions.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great read, one of his good ones, makes you believe in the characters, twist at ending keeps you<br />Wanting to finish
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|I would never give Barbra a bad review.  I have followed her since the 60's and have almost every album (I mean LPs - had to buy a turntable so I could listen to her old ones that I can't find on CD).  She is gorgeous and her voice is heavenly.  I hope she never stops singing.  The PBS special of this concert is a must see, don't miss it.
