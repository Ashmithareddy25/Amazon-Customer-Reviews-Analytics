1609983327|5.0|This is one of a series of audio books of P G Wodehouse novels, read by Jonathan Cecil.<br /><br />I heard several of the audio books in this sseries; all that I've heard are excellent. Jonathan Cecil handles Wodehouse's prose really well. He does a very good job of voicing all the various characters in the books.<br /><br />If you iike the Jeeves and Wooster books, you'll like the way they're read in this audio book series featuring Jonathan Cecil.<br /><br />There's also an abidged version of this title. Make sure you order the unabridged version.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|The movie/first episode \\"Serenity\\" is scary as well as funny at times. The rest of the show is less scary, more funny and suspenseful. I love the characters and the humor.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is the best! Hubby and I watch it together and love it cant wait for the rest of season 3!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I've liked the first 3 Stone Sour albums, but I love this one.  \\"Gone Sovereign\\" is a good opener.  Hard and fast.  Corey Taylor is hands down one of the best and most versatile vocalists in the business.  Waiting for Part Two already

B007N5YIUS|5.0|first time playing angry birds  just 2 weeks ago and it was really fun. I liked the challenge and graphics.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to say that Jillian has kicked my butt..  9 months ago i weighed 160 pounds.  I now weigh 120.  I started running and dieting and lost the weight within 6 months.. I then bought the jillian micheals 30 day shred.  I not only was able to maintain my weight during the winter but I became thinner because I was losing fat and building muscles.  Now I am 5 foot 2 inches, so 120 pounds looks like a litter more on my short stubby body but i feel as if im in great shape.  I am able to do things I was never able to do before.  Not all of this was because of Jillian I lost the weight from running and dieting, but I got in shape with Jillian.  Not to mention where I live November-March I would freeze outside running and I get bored with my tredmill.  I belive counting out the 30 seconds on the reps really really helps with finishing the cardio.  Whatever you do dont stop, dont skip, dont wimp out.  I know you can and so do you!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had never played before. I'm really behind the times. Now I'm addicted. Everyone will love this game. Fun graphics.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater, and was moved enough to purchase my own copy. The production values and acting are more consistent in this latest film from the Kendrick brothers, but, again, the heart of the story is what drew me in and kept me interested. Thought-provoking and at times heart-breaking, this movie follows 4 men as they each face their demons and personal challenges in a faith-based way.<br /><br />I bought this copy as a gift.
B005LAII12|5.0|Seth Macfarlane is a god among men, when it comes to \\"real life\\" comedy! Highly recommended movie.  I Love It!!
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I have made several little knick knacks with this so far. Only down side is that the cutter will dull after a couple cuts.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Somehow my wife and I missed seasons 1 and 2 but after a single episode of season 3 we are hooked.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like the game so far not that far into the game before it asked for a review.  It seems like its going to be good.  Definetly worth trying out.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|The previews looked good in the theaters but when it came to the dollar theater so quickly I was concerned it was a flop.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie (and she is not a Clint Eastwood fan).
B000V63BV8|4.0|good follw up to Appetite for Destruction and better than Use Your Illusion 1 or 2. Guns and Roses in my oppinion doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame just because of the weaker albums after Lies but for their first two albums, inspired work.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|The acting in this movie could not have possibly been any worse.  Wow.  I wasn't even sober and it still was terrible!  Stay away!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We were delightfully surprised at all the extra features this combo offered. I bought it for my wife, who usually doesn't care about whether or not it's blue ray or has any extra features since she doesn't take the time to watch or notice extras (as she puts it). However, with this she was stunned and can't wait to take the time to see everything it has!
B005DD7H50|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie - bought it for the eye candy, liked it for the plot  :) It was a lot better than I expected, and the plot was such a cool concept!  It felt like the first time watching the Matrix.  Very well done.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I really like Bruce Willis, he is a great actor, I think I may purchase this DVD so that I can watch it again, and again
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a must read for those who are looking for non traditional sex techniques and are not afraid to experiment in a world not usually spoken about.
B005VPRG10|5.0|very good product, it is usefull and I recibed in perfect condition, i recomend for other costumers this item, very good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are a must have for all couples who have dull sex lives. The books are a realistic look at kinky sex. While this area of sexual exploration is often not talked about it is definitely one of the more interesting ways couples can add excitement into a dull relationship.<br />On the other hand if you want a fast moving romantic read this is definitely the book for you. I can guarantee you , you will not put these books down till you are finished. Hopefully the author will write more books on this rarely talked about area of sexual behavior as well as other area not explored yet.
B009DH371K|5.0|My son-in-law asked for this and he loves it.  He listened to it right away.  The sound was clear and you could really hear what the musicians had to say.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a must read for the fantasy set. It is fast moving and intrigueing. It will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book for age 13 to college. Great story line and there are sequels to it so the story continues,
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a must if you are interested in knowing about non traditional sex technique. It will definitely make your sex life interesting.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I was disappointed with this movie.  After all of the hype about it I found it to be a letdown and not very well done.
B000FCK9D6|5.0|Great &#34;fun&#34; reading and I think one of Christies best mysteries. If you are a fan of &#34;who done it &#34;books then read this one.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|I was looking at some of the weather apps to pick one for my Kindle and came across this one which seems to have everything I need and then some.  All kinds of information and even some I wasn't expecting to find.  The bottom of the page contains the selection of pages to go to, and a click on one will bring up the data immediately.  I haven't had any trouble with this and am happy I chose it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so munch l think you loot this out to the. world. some tips I shod tell you is have it lour exuding.
0385738757|2.0|The majority of pain received when reading this book will be from the terrible dialog. If children are really speaking like this then it is already too late to stop the end of the world. The slang includes gems like clunk, shuck, crank, and shank. But instead of feeling like you've entered a new culture you simply feel as though your watching a group of pre-teens trying to impress you. The characters also have a habit of speaking their every thought out loud. Nothing is ever implied or even hinted at, leaving the reader no room to wonder what motives might be moving these children (and what fun is that?). The children also seem to act and think in a completely brainwashed manner, leaving me to wonder whether that is intended or not. The main character particularly seems to suffer from a lack of complete faith, often believing only what he sees at that exact moment. For example: He is told to trust his best friend no matter what happens and he agrees. Then when his friend hits him he decides to hate her for the rest of the novel. When everything is finally combined this book turns its readers into zombies more efficiently than the T-Virus...for full review go to theofficebooks.blogspot
B008VBYN80|4.0|I like the game, don't like having to spend real money,, had uninstall and download it again but I'm glad I did. all the bugs seemed to be fixed. does anyone still play this game if so I need some friends. greg2523
1419705849|5.0|Just like the others in the series, my son loved this book. We prefer the hardcover so I was glad that I was able to buy it cheaper online than in the stores.

B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies ever. Story line is well written and even after watching it many times, you want to come back to it and watch it again.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Never thought that I would enjoy a book this much. Great for book clubs and mainly for older students.<br />Wow
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not a huge Nicholas Sparks fan but when I seen there was a movie coming out I thought I would read the book.  I was not disappointed! I couldn't put the book down and it did have a little drama, suspense and of course romance!
B000GCFG7E|3.0|This is probably my least favorite In the Reacher series so far. I have loved the series but this book suffers from the worst of all the flaws of the series, without some of the better redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The scenarios are far fetched, once again Reacher just stumbles into a multi million dollar ransom scenario while drinking a coffee. Some of the better books put him in these situations based on his earlier military history and contacts. But here he is just at the right place at the right time to get involved.<br /><br />The relationships he forms seem off, he's had romances develop in the course of his adventures before, but here it isn't believable, just by virtue of working through the situation with an ex-FBI agent the romance seems an obligatory or compulsory part of the formula; no real development of the relationship.<br /><br />The big bad isn't very compelling, nor are the band of ex- military cohorts. And it ends in the typical formulaic ending with Reacher storming the bad guys against tall odds, but without the suspense or interesting tactics we've read before.<br /><br />I like Reachers laconic personality, don't mind the many &#34;Reacher said nothing&#34;s, from other reviews. But there was virtually zero development or progression of his character in this book. Aside from the strange hyper accurate mental clock that was constantly referenced, Reacher didn't provide any new insights into his character or background.<br /><br />I'm hoping it was just a dud and we get back to the great thrillers we did have with the Reacher series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Is a review necessary at this point? Who hasn't played it? No one needs my opinion on this game. It is what it is.
159413586X|4.0|I was excited to read this book when it came out. When I was reading it, the book was a little harder to get through compared to her other books which I couldn't put down.<br /><br />The book did have some loose ends that the author could have addressed and there is a good amount of sadness in this book. The ending could have been better and it seemed like even though she resented her mother to begin with, in the end she seemed to act the same.<br /><br />Overall I did like the book and do recommend it.
0061726834|5.0|Set in a version of the United States where the borders are closed to the rest of the world to control the spread of the deadly and rampant Amor deliria nervosa - aka 'love'. Strict curfews, guards and a religious government control every aspect of a teenager's life to prevent a resurgence of this disease and in return citizens live long, \\"healthy\\" and conflict free lives. The story follows Lena, months away from the procedure that'll prevent this devastating illness that has cast a dark shadow over her entire life - but then someone unexpected happens, and soon she finds herself torn between her perfect life and the truth...or is it just Amor deliria nervosa taking root?<br /><br />  There was so much hype for each of the books released that I just knew I had to read this book, but at 411 pages it seemed quite daunting. So knowing I'd be spending a lot of time on the beach in Mexico I figured it'd be a perfect companion. I ended up finishing this book in a couple of sittings, it was absolutely engrossing!<br /><br />  The beginning of the chapters contain a little snippet with a bit of the history of this alternate world, or facts about their society and the disease. Oliver considers every tiny detail and builds this intricate culture and an incredibly realistic disease. When I was reading the descriptions of the disease I'd end up stopping to think and compare my own life experiences with love to the checklist (I've definitely got it bad....) and marveling at the conviction of the government to control this disease.<br /><br />  Lena, the main character was surprisingly complex and multifaceted. On one hand she had absolute confidence in her elders, and that the path she's set on is the right one. While she regurgitates all the right answers, and does as she's told there's this wonderful rebellious spark to her that pops out unexpectedly! I loved watching her evolution from this reserved law abiding citizen, to someone who craved life and love and would do anything for it.<br /><br />  Alex - love interest extraordinaire and just full of surprises! He's hardworking, devoted and risks everything for even the slightest chance at love. With a painful past, and full of secrets I was definitely as intrigued as Lena about this boy!<br /><br />  While it took me a little bit of time to get used to the rigid style of writing that occurs in the beginning, I quickly realized that like Lena, there was a bold divide where the writing takes on the excitement and passion that the characters go through. It works wonders for contrasting the strictness of the city to the wild abandon of The Wilds!<br /><br />  Oliver takes these two on a whirlwind romance of summer lovin'. But as Lena learns more about a whole other world she was completely ignorant about, the more her own world starts to crumble as her deadline for the treatment quickly approaches. Oliver had me so captivated by the characters, and the tense situations they were in that I never even saw the major reveals and twists! Also...THAT ENDING! OH MY THAT ENDING!<br /><br />Oliver's writing is marvelously paced in a twisted world where love is a debilitating disease and with characters that live like there's no tomorrow. Go read it if you haven't already!!g for it.<br /><br />  Alex - love interest extraordinaire and just full of surprises!

B009B8YZKS|1.0|Which made me mad.  I thought the online videos were a teaser for more stuff on this bluray, but there was NO new material.  What a waste.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a very captivating book with several points of view. It maintains your curiosity to eventually find the truth. It is well written from the perspective of a man and a woman.
B0096PS4Y4|5.0|One of the greatest albums issued in the '60s and one that retains 100% of its impact. Deserves to be heard by everyone. I've been playing the original since it was issued in 1967 and it still grips me every play. This reissue has greater dynamics and is arguably better sounding than the original. Not surprising since it was mastered by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering and pressed at RTI. It goes without saying that it sounds better than any CD version...ever.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Action packed with a good story. It is also comes in at the perfect length to keep your attention and keep you interested.
0385536828|3.0|I was expecting more from this great author. A writer writing about fictional writers is just not very interesting. In the end I just could not get myself to care about any of the characters which made the book difficult to read.<br /><br />I will try again with the next Ian McEwan novel.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Pi is the guy I want to be one day- he is a fighter and he never lets go of hope. He quickly learns that everything he needs to survive life is inside of himself. This is a great read for a person that is struggling with making personal changes and finding the true meaning of happiness within their life. I found that I was not only able to connect to Pi, but sometimes I saw myself in Richard Parker. Other times I knew I was the meerkats- all of them. Martel's story reminded me why I must always make reading an important part of my life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never liked zombies before but the story was so addicting I got over the zombie part of it and loved the show!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is our most favorite past-time entertainment and we enjoy playing the cards alot. Been a fan of this for many years.

B0072GPPNC|5.0|I loved this movie! I origanly wanted it because my favorit actor, Tom Hiddleston, was in it. After watching it I just fell in love with the story. There were many times that I almost cryed during the film, none the less it is a great film. A work of art, truly Spielberg hasn't lost his touch!

B003TSEEDY|4.0|The characters were interesting but Charlie, the main character is a bit hard to relate to. He is a little overly emotional but you begin to understand why near the end. Definitely a good read about high school life. It is nice how it is written as letters to the reader.<br />MAIN POINT: Good read, I suggest it. The novel takes you through a year of Charlie's high school life while he figures out friendship, how to deal with his past, and how to participate in life instead of just observing it.
B000Q99EAC|4.0|My 7 yr old LOVES the Rocky films and was very pleased with this one. Looks like it will be a constant order for us in the future!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't even to begin to explain how much I love this book and the first. I liked it all much and it kept me waiting more, that I read it in less then 48 hours. It was amazing.  I have to admit though, I've read reviews for the third book and it has me stuck. Stuck to figure out if it's really worth my time. Most people have said no, but I find this urge in me that says to get it anyways. I would love to read it, but I don't wanna be disappointed in the rather then just stop and this one and be happy. I'm sure I'll get regardless, because how can I read both with such excitement and then not see how it all ends and what could possibly happen to make me change my mind so fast like the others?  Some say the disappointed were stuck on the fairytale happily ever after ending, but I know better then that in reality. If it isn't the ending I like, then just suck it up, the author made it this way for a reason. I'm still trying to figure out whether it's worth or not, but I really loved both so far so no matter what disappointment I don't think it has an impact over the first two amazing books. I would recommend reading this and the first book, they were amazing and kept you wanting more.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This is an entertaining and absorbing game to play. The puzzles are hard enough to keep your<br />interest but not so hard to frustrate.  I am not sure it is worth the $4.99 you are prompted<br />to pay but a fun game nonetheless.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|It was no surprise that the &#34;meaning&#34; discovered by Frankl was God and His created purpose for our lives.  It was also no surprise that when we focus on both, there is a strength in us that defies the most horrid of life's circumstances.  What was surprising was that Frankl was able to &#34;see&#34; so clearly this truth in the midst of the horror of each day's suffering and death.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|A fun and simple game. Anybody can learn it immediately but there's enough challenge to be entertaining for more than a few minutes. A dollar would've made more sense, but it is an artistic game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It one of the best games I've got on my phone it is funny and will blow your mind OK people get this game
B008OOYALE|4.0|Love this so addicting. It is a great game to get. The dragons are awesome. The only thing I don't like it cost so much to clear land.
0765325950|1.0|Wow.  Really?  Manipulating a fan base in order to force an undeserved legacy.  What a waste of my time.  The fans who have dedicated so many years to the tedium of the endless, pointless wandering of secondary characters must now endure the insult of being manipulated to achieve a NYT rating.  Unforgivable.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's a fun game to play its like bejewel you don't have to invite people to help you get to the next level
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are totally hooked on this show.  The characters are well defined and the storytelling is well-crafted and addictive.  I recommend purchasing season 1 and following the plot in sequence.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This season came carefully wrapped and arrived in prompt time for me to watch, so I could catch up on the story!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was a good read from the beginning. Reacher is a believable and failable hero. Looking forward to the next book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wa happy to find this series on DVD because I got to see some of the shows I had missed on TV!
B001I8A76A|3.0|Pinks vocal talent is very strong and powerful. The album is not her best but definately full of energy and charisma.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I bought this DVD for my sister and she was thrilled.  I coudln't believe how fast this product arrived to my home.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|Zach Brown Band is at the top of his game. The music has so much heart and soul. i totally recommend it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I like the fact that it's actually a \\"smart app\\", it will not let you upload duplicate photos from your phone..
161218412X|5.0|I have wanted to read the Sherlock series for a long time and here I find the entire collection. I won't write about the content, there is enough reviews that comment on that but I am here to say that you won't regret purchasing this product for even a second. It has quality that is noticed from afar. And I wouldn't have been able to buy it if Amazon had not sold this at such a low price and I'm thankful to have them around. Buy this now and get into the world of Sherlock Holmes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found this book to be heartwarming, in spite of the tragedy it projects as a whole, and inspiring to say the least. Give it a shot you don't really have a choice if you read book one now do you!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is by far the best game on the app store. I am not getting paid to say this. Honestly I love this game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watch it every week now that I've caught up in the first two seasons.Excellent program. There should be more programs like  this.
1449410243|5.0|really funny...love it..all cat lovers will definetly like this book..<br />I recommend it...good for laughs..bought for a gift, they called me to say it was a great book....
034580404X|5.0|James has opened up a world to new readers which is full of questions about your own identity. This triliogy honestly makes you think about what you would deal with and to what extent you would go to for someone you love unconditionally. She has made it easy to fall in love with Ana and the idea of finding a love that is uncomparable to anything you've ever known! While, Ana has to tackle this roller coaster ride of life and all the punches it throws at her she stands strong regardless of the circumstances. Yes, there are several juciy parts of their love making, but in the end it's a love story, a story of endurance, a story of unconditional love, and an in depth look at the mind with all it's mysteries and psycological battles. 50 Shades Trilogy is quite an experience and leaves you questioning your thoughts on life, love, sex, and why people do the things they do in general. All aroud great read, and definately not something you'll likely forget anytime soon after reading!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I liked the story,but, again did not enjoy the vulgar language and so much sex. Young authors seem to  have difficulty finding the words to express feelings and frustrations, so they use the &#34;F&#34; word for everything.
B0024F08RO|5.0|From the 1st season to the last. Keeps you hanging, love the twists and turns amazing story line. Men and women enjoy watching. We want more.
B009329Y30|4.0|All around great acting performance.  Efron needs to break away from the sappy chic flick.  Too much untapped talent to waist it on the aforementioned.
0765325950|5.0|this was good i like it very good really it was quite satisfied no complaints i really cant say it enough
B005DZMODI|5.0|I was at the shows and they are well captured here. Superb musicianship and an amazing New Orleans funeral style version of Layla. You will love this. Get the CD DVD package for maximum enjoyment.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|For the price and a useful tool for camping and around the house, you can't go wrong.  I would,imagine it was also be a useful tool in a survival situation. As with every tool, there are always some pros and cons, no matter what the price.  The cons....Teeth on the file could be more aggressive....flashlight has no &#34;O&#34; rings, therefore, it is not waterproof. Pros.....I would purchase this multitool package again, just to have a set of tools and a flashlight at my disposal at anytime; I wear mine everyday.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|This is a great book,it takes the time to point out to us all what we miss by not living life to it,s fullest.<br />The only thing I can fault this book is some of the words in the book are not used today so some of the meanings are lost .<br />I know the words used were common for the time but for the average Joe today it detracts from the story.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|though my review isnt going to be as awesome and thorough like a lot of others, i just have to comment on how beautiful this story is.  i agree with a lot of others that even though its a pixar animated movie, its just as much for adults, if not more than it is for kids.  not ratings-wise but content wise.<br /><br />the story follows the old man through his love, loss and promises, and the journey along the way.<br /><br />I will admit, i started crying in the first 10 minutes of the movie, its so incredibly sweet, and it reminded me of my own grandparents in that they were each others first and ONLY love, and my mama just recently passed, so the movie reeeally connected with me on that level because i can see my papa in the old man in the movie.<br /><br />it's definitely a little different than your typical animated film, but if youre into the kind of more mature animated subjects and dig a sweet story, then definitely give this movie a shot.  you won't be disappointed.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love the CD.... Lots of different genres on this album.. fun to listen to. packaged well.  Listening to it constantly.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno Mars and this album is nothing short of amazing. Very versatile. Amazon MP3 player for iPhone is a must!! Thanks amazon
B008HJGPVO|3.0|This multi-tip stylus is a little overkill since it has three different tips,  the inside tip would have been great if it was a ballpoint pen to make this gadget better.  All the tips are great to use, but I only use one tip on my kindle, windows phone and ipad so one tip really would have been enough.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you love sci-Fi, video games, different takes on future, socially awkward, and just an overall nerd, you are bound to love this book. It reminds me of The Westing Game except it's set in the future with all this advanced technology that's just incredible. Basically, Wade Watts or ,as his Oasis knows him, Parzival is trying to win an interactive simulation game that holds three Keys and gates that unlock clues to the next gates that lead to the big prize: billions of dollars and the whole entire oasis, an interactive simulation game where everyone practically lives in to escape the depressing realty of what is left of the whole world. This book is engaging, suspenseful, and just pure awesomeness of freedom. A total must read for tech nerds everywhere.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints me.  This book kept me interested from start to finish and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, enjoyed from the first word, would definitely recommend to book lovers. First book I'm reading by Colleen Hoover, but I can assure it won't be my last......Great work!
B005LAII80|1.0|I'm surprised this film got such high rating.  No storyline.  Just continuous shooting, blow ups.<br /><br />3D effect is poor. There is only one disk  contain both regular and 3d version.  Its like watching 2d blueray with 5 minute 3d effect added.  Camera work lousy.  C grade actors.  Don't need acting,just walk from room to room and shoot.  You have to be brain dead COD player to like this film.
0898159156|5.0|The information is thorough, including the coverage of species I never knew existed! Overall I now know the trick is rain water or purified water!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed reading his story, left me with more questions unanswered. I guess I will have to wait till it is my turn to find out.
B001RNO7AS|5.0|Bought these as a gift for my husband.  He loves them!  Said that they were great right out of the box.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Amazing, Vivid and colorful picture quality. Great narration by David Attenborough. If you loved Planet Earth then this is a must buy.
0345803485|1.0|Not worth the money. Don't buy into the hype. It's not sexy. I didn't offend me. This book is just not well-written at all. The other review about it being written by a teenage is SPOT-ON. It's over-hyped junk. If you want a sexual book at least find a talented author with a gift of the English language. This person describes things and gushes like a child. Only the very simplest of minds would want to read it. I think teenagers would even find this too simple. I will say the concept is a good concept but very poorly executed.
B00APACSJG|5.0|I don't know where LMB gets her ideas from, but this is a very interesting concept for a techno-corporate &#34;invasion&#34;.
0345803507|5.0|Interesting and Exciting! Looooooovd it! Thank you! Prompt Delivery! Great! Ther is nothing more to say except I would recommend it to friends!
B000FC10WU|5.0|A classic Christie that won't disappoint. Keeps you guessing right to the end. Miss Marple's clever sleuthing does it again.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|It was an ok movie but not really up to par. Just like any other movie out there think of J. Edgar. Those types of movies are just ok.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I heard about Eben Alexander's book through a radio talk show and felt I had to read it.<br />As a medical doctor his book is a little clinical but still provides a wonderful affirmation of what happens when one's brain dies and reinforces the value of the relationships we build in this life and their relevance in the next. I'm very glad I read this book.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|any Facebook user would love this. I prefer skype myself. it is good that the kindle fire has it though as an option, a lot of my friends appreciate this
B004QX07G4|3.0|A little bit on the silly side for me.  I love her show.  she usually has great monologues and is a wonderful interviewer with her guests.  I guess I expected the book to be more like her show.
B0058W74UY|1.0|it doesn't work on my kindle . and so a waste of time I would love to be able to watch videos supported by flashplayer
B0063B2BNE|5.0|it's a great season of a great series. very enjoyable and funny.<br />more words required more words more words words
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Everything is awesome except for the comfort level. The control features are all there including separate volumes for chat and game. The sound quality is excellent with booming bass (also adjustable)>
0553573403|5.0|Awesome, quality read, very well written, dynamic plot , once you start reading it's hard to stop. Highly recommend to anyone!
B009O07NBQ|4.0|I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who liked the soundtracks of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, the Chronicles of Narnia, and to any John Williams fan. It's definitely my style of music.<br />My favorite is probably Over Hill, which contains the main theme, but I have to say, I like all of them.<br />Cons:<br />- It's split into 2 CDs, making it difficult to load properly into iTunes or a phone.<br />- It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to get to the second CD! The case has two hinges.<br />- Not too cheap, but not too expensive, I guess.<br />Definitely would recommend.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This story captivated my imagination as a child - I have lived as a young child in a hot climate.  Still holds good.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|True to Tim Burton style movies it has a strange feel throughout the movie, however the humor in this movie was so great, I want to own this movie now.  Johnny Depp barely looks like himself throughout the movie (he looks 20 years younger!) and each character was just so great!  Loved it!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Winning the Man Booker prize was a slight turn-off for me, and of course there was the much-publicised improbability of a boy and a tiger marooned in a boat. However, out of curiosity, I downloaded the book before deciding on seeing the film.  Thank heaven this is not a book written in the present tense - a stylistic trick I particularly hate. The way of introducing the first-person narrative reminds me of many novels of the late 19th century early 20th century. The prose flows easily and the unexpected amount of information on keeping animals in zoos retained my interest. The scenes on the ocean require a certain willing suspension of disbelief and I loved the plot twist.  The ending is abrupt, but what else could the author do?
B007RE0SCW|5.0|the product came fast and did not have alot of small pieces for my daughter to lose<br />She is enjoying
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Just love these movies and the idea of an international police force watching out for visitors getting up to mischief and protecting the Earth, especially this movie which fills in the blanks so to speak about one of the main characters. This has been one good movie to watch.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|I received it on time and it was packed well. I needed it for Christmas and it came exactly when promised.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|a different angle in the Bourne Series and great storyline with good acting by all which added to an entertaining watch
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first, so when I began reading the book, it was very hard to put down. It kept me interested from beginning to end.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|A &#34;mod&#34; take on swinging 1960s London, with a bit of a mystery and some existentialist angst built in. Very much a movie of its time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome Book...Written many years ago, but still a very exciting book. Finished it in three, four days. I never read books, but I finished this one.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I may have bought this thinking it was a different novel than \\"Pillars,\\" which I loved. I read it anyway. Maybe retitling is another way to entice readers who didn't choose a book the first time around.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very shocking...What happened...I am still shocked...But I just read reviews for the third book and I just read the plot and I was kind of disappointed and shocked at the ending. Wow.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|excellent but short, would be better to publish the 3 books in ine, stiil very enjoable and well written<br />Recommended
B005OK725M|5.0|Zoe Saldana is the best. I love all of her movies. I hope she keeps on making great movies. =)
B00004TJKI|4.0|AOAM clocks in at 2 1/2 hours, and while this does give the actors a lot to say and do - and they do it well - the film begins to drag after 120 minutes. It is one thing for the clashing attorneys to make their witnesses squirm, its another to make viewers squirm in impatience. But then this is Otto Preminger making a p-o-i-n-t, very Germanically, it seems.<br /><br />AOAM has some very effective cinematography. The scenes are well-framed for the drama they contain and the actors hit their marks just right as the drama unfolds, and unfolds, and unfolds. The verdict almost comes as a let-down when it is finally reached.<br /><br />I very much liked the use of jazz in the soundtrack and about fell off the couch when I recognized THE Duke Ellington playing in the local Michigan club. The jazz effect still works; it hasn't become dated.<br /><br />Performances: my favorites were Ben Gazzara as Lt. Manyon and George C. Scott as the Lansing Asst DA. James Stewart came off as James Stewart and not a new character. Eve Arden as the efficient and much put upon secretary did a yeoman (or woman) job, as she always does.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was two short...I wish it was longer. I read it in two days. Want to get the other ones.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's Angry Birds.  I had heard so much about Angry Birds I was happy when I got my Kindle I could finally find out what the hype was about.  It's addictive & fun.  Now I understand it's popularity - besides I like hearing the birds noises :)
B000092Q7O|5.0|The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.  I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend it to you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love being able to click on an app & see what the weather is coming my way.  It also has long term so I can see into the next week.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.  I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend it to you.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Enjoying this game and I like that I can change the backgrounds.  There are so many different combinations I haven't had any repeats.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.  I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend it to you.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is fun and very well done. I wish the peanuts were a little easier to come by but honestly,  it's not that difficult to play without them.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.  I am satisfied with this purchase and recommend it to you.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|It is very hard to find a movie without sex, excessive violence, or excess language these days.  It is pg-13 for mild violence and mild images but it is one of only a handful I allow my kids to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely addictive. Maggie Smith has created one if my favorite characters of all time. The depth to this series matches it's ability to entertain and pull you in further which in each episode.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Hard to find movies without sex, language, or excess violence.  This is one of a handful of PG -13 movies I allow my kids to watch.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Has most useful bits even Y bits that you will need to work on macbook pro. I used it replace my dvd drive with hard drive
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Its a good movie that took some licenses with the book, but I was overall happy with it.  I can't wait for the other movies.
0321885112|5.0|I'm not much of an artist but this book empowers you that your \\"stick figure drawings\\" can be used for productive documentation.<br /><br />I've used to guide to create visual masterpieces for my notes. I can actually capture the mood of the meeting I'm in and the results are fantastic. I picked up the video edition and the high quality HD videos are as helpful as the publication itself.<br /><br />If you are looking to give your lame, boring, \\"date-only\\" notes a face-lift, I highly recommend The Sketchnote Handbook.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Kept waiting to feel something special. A touching story, just did not meet my expectations. Not a book I will be recommending.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The storyline is superb, but the whole language and situation is definately R rated.  I was fully engaged nnc couldn't put it down!
031237593X|4.0|I am still reading it but I think it will meet my expectations.  In my country we are on summer vacations and it´s a good time to read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched 21 episodes in 29 hours, It's that good.<br />Even though it tends to make me mad, it's still that good.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game isnbetter than other 'project's gamesnout there. It doesn't demand you spend real money to accomplish most things. But the game crashes often. Going into the wilderness results in a crash almost halfnthe time. If that were fixed then wouldnrate.the game higher.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great book, love it! Lot of interesting information. I am European and no it does not make me homesick. i appreciate living in the USA so much more.
0765325950|4.0|This would have been a 5 star book had the ending been good. 95% of the book is great hence the 4 stars but that ending was just so sloppy I wanted to give it a lower rating. I feel like Brian Anderson took great care of all the details for this 3 part finale to the series then all of a sudden got lazy in the end and just hurried to put an end to it.Thats what it feels like.<br /><br />Its an ending appropriate if you were maybe planning on a Part 2. But we all know this is it so WTF???! Its not \\"bad\\" but its so WEAK!!!!! Im outraged actually. The book/series deserves a much much better ending than it got. Im not complaining about the characters that died. Im complaining about a poorly written end which failed to tie up loose ends.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|absolutely wonderful! It is interesting, and at times it really draws on your emotions, but it is done very well.
0545265355|5.0|The books were for my daughter who loved the movie.  She enjoyed the books greatly and she would recommend the books to anyone.  Full of action
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|my nephew loved this set.  good price, happy to to have been able to find it for my nephew, he loved it.
B00656C6KK|5.0|A lovely CD with some hidden treats to discover.  Being a Doris Day fan for over 50 years, I think I just about have all her movies & music.  The treat here is her version of Billy Preston song 'You Are So Beautiful', and then inviting her son Terry Melcher to sing 'Happy Endings'.  These 2 songs along with the rest of the CD take you on a magical Doris Day journey.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Item was shipped on time and the price and quality were good.<br /> CD is great for Dylan fans . enjoying it
0307236722|4.0|This is an excellent baking book- good variety of recipes, clear instructions and the recipes I tried came out great.  The book itself is well put together with tons of pictures of techniques and finished items.  However, I was annoyed that so many of the recipes require special pans.  The section on yeast bread was the worst.  You'll need: brioche molds, English muffin rings, baba molds, pannetone mold, a pellman loaf pan.  And a special tool to slash the tops of loaves before baking (why not a knife?).
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When my original cable for my Kindle 2 started to disintegrate I was alarmed until I realized many others had the same problem. I contacted customer service outlining my problem and they quickly replaced the cable. They had me ship it 2 day shipping which I paid for but they refunded my account right away. Overall excellent service and great results.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished reading this and have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I loved all of the characters so much and the story kept my interest and I couldn't WAIT to find out what was going to happen next.  Nice twists in the story!  Highly recommended!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really love these books I read all of them but not this one yet so now I feel complete with all the book collections I own and I want to read more of the Greg Heffley diary of a wimpy kid series so keep up with the amazing work.
0152067043|3.0|My daughter is a Pre K student  at LSU in Baton Rouge and looking forward to reading to children in her classroom.  Mem Fox  is her favorite teacher and we have given Ten Little Fingers as a gift before.  I purchased all of your available Mem Fox board books expecting each of them to be the same size.  Nothing on your web page indicated that the books would be too small for classroom use.  Pls consider listing size in your description.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Many people involved in everyday lives just struggling to get along with their job, their family, and friends, and tucked away everywhere, these people find love in all sorts of ways.  This is my favorite Christmas movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was fantastic!! I could not put it down. I wish there were more books. If she write more I will definitely read them
B007SGM084|5.0|I initially purchased these books thru amazon via paperback, then for Christmas I received a kindle so I also purchased it there.  The books are incredible and I have now read the trilogy in its entirety, twice!  I'm sure I'll read it again.  I rarely ever read books twice but these were well worth it!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|As several other reviewers have said, the author basically toots his own horn through out the book, and he just comes across as arrogant.  I haven't finished the book yet, but I'm having a hard time sticking with it.  I'll finish it I guess because I'm interested in the missions, just not in the way the book is written.  By the way, I'm 40% through according to my Kindle, and it's been other missions.  He's building up to the mission with Bin Laden, which I image will be close to the end of the book.  So, if you're expecting the whole book to be about that mission (as the second part of the title implies), you will be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I can't add anything worthwhile to a review of Facebook.  Either you love Facebook or you hate it.  Too bad once you get use to how it works, the programmers change things.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|The movie was great , I think the rentals are priced a bit high though, same movie at redbox for less than I paid with a 3.00 off coupon at Amazon
B008NW67E0|5.0|Hard to beat this follow up - while slightly more low key then the bands first album its solid from start to finish!
B008J34466|4.0|Not her &#34;best&#34; album to boot but I enjoy listening to her sing! I do recommend this track to anyone that has a likng  for her.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|It's best to watch this movie with a full stomach. If not then you'll be sadly disappointed by anything you might creat after watching it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a great time waster. My whole family loves this game even my 7 and 4 year old !!!!
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|another great album by a great band , they are a bunch of sickos and  I love it!!!<br />It's almost as great as their first.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a excellent book and a excellent series. I actually like it better then 50 shades I hope she writes more then just 3 in the series. I have already pre ordered the next one hurry May
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story line holds your interest and has alot of good twists and turns. This is a good and enjoyable read.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was good book because well I don't know I just happen to enjoy them and also I've been looking this book for a long time  so I'm pretty happy about it
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Great read, always loved the twists and turns that Dan Brown takes you through in his novels. Well worth it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books can't wait to read the final one. Suzanne Collins knows how to keep the readers wanting more
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good read!!  Keeps you reading because you need to find out what happens between the couple.  Great love story.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the book till the end. I felt like I was reading a soap opera, too much happened at once and her emotions were like a rollercoaster. I understand that she had just been told all of this crazy stuff about her life, but it was like she couldn't figure out what to do till the very last second and then she did 10 different things at once.<br />Still love the book, and I would still recommend it. :)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie in Blu-ray is stupendous! It makes the viewer feel as if we're really there sharing in the ation.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does what I want. No need for anything else. Now I can relax knowing that I will not miss that appointment next morning...
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have always been a big Harry Bosch fan. . . and this one does not dissapoint. A great read with new twists.
B00000K3G8|4.0|The Talking Heads have filmed one of their novel performances as a sound track. Real fine. The DVD of the performance is worth a view also.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Delivery was fast but truthfully I have not had alot of time to read the book, I just glanced at it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game to play at my leisure. Fun trying to get the different breeds of dragons. Just wish that Apple would allow non Apple users to have access to GameCenter. It's difficult getting friends without it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game.  I have ADHD and helps and keeps me focused. As for me personally,  a game that can keep my attention I give it 10 stars.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Story of a emotionally immature and personality weak young women.  Dominated by her mother and her mother's attempt to live through her with tragic consequences.  Very well acted.  Enjoyed the music and the dancing also.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|After seeing them in concert together, I just had to buy this!  It's a beautiful compilation of their individual hits, highlighting both their incredible talents!
B000002KGT|5.0|How can there be 399 reviews for this deluxe set when it doesn't get released for another 10 days in the future.  Seems impossible to me.
B009KHCT94|1.0|Although the movie correctly describes progressives as evil,it uses the wrong players. It should have had an Obama look-a-like playing the fool President. Also it depicts white males as evil. This must be a production of the NAACP. Very anti-American. No worth.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Very easy read and I never wanted to put it down!! Can't wait to read the other two books.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Despite the fact that there are only three episodes, this series is lovely. As a devotee to \\"Downton Abbey\\", I can't seem to get enough of the aristocracy and their relationship with the help. Characters don't have time to be well developed in only three episodes however, while Downton Abbey was on hiatus, it was a great way to soothe my cravings.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Got it as an Amazon free app. Totally addictive game. Common sense but challenging. I cannot leave a puzzle incomplete.
B003O86FMW|5.0|\\"BLOWN AWAY\\"  .....figuratively & literally speaking about the second book in \\"THE HUNGER GAMES\\" series...I never saw it coming!  Don't miss this SPELLBINDING SERIES!
B0081336FO|5.0|This is the best version of the Homes stories I have seen to date. The charm and skill of the actors, directors, writers and the whole production is top notch.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Well written Mr. Grisham.<br /><br />Intertwined and keeping you reading are unique plots of facts and faction, plus surprises to the end.<br /><br />Read this! You will enjoy the carefully laid out plans of Mr. Bannister.  I did!
B003TJR2HS|3.0|It is a clever little thing it's just that they take too much advantage of you being is a spot wanting to use your older iPod with new equipment. It should only cost a couple of bucks but what choice do you have?
1455502758|5.0|A truly inspiring and morbid book in which the late and great Christopher Hitchens bravely and fearlessly confronts the cancer which ultimately took his life. One comes to realize after reading this book (if one had already not realized before) what a truly special person Hitch was. Mortality is a short composite of his writings as he was facing the Reaper. Hitch stayed intellectually honest and poignant until the very end. Hitch is greatly missed.. :(
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Extremely funny and entertaining!  This is a great family movie.  Our family enjoyed it so much at the theater that we decided to add it to our DVD collection.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this app! I always know how much time I have to do every type of activity! Well worth $2.00!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|It's a great app. It is accurate within 1 or 2 degrees of temps.  Time is always current.  I Love it!
B0094WK9EC|5.0|This album is GREAT! I love it and sometimes it makes me drive fast on accident because it's so upbeat.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|AMAZING! I want more! I like all the different twists because it made it so much more unpredictable. I'm sad it's over.
B008R14YBK|5.0|My Daughter loves this CD so much, she sings it on the shower, her room, she plays it every time she get s a chance, I even like the music my self.<br />great buy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i have seen all the reviews about colleen hoover's book \\"hopeless\\", and they are very long in detail and very correct in how good it was. i too loved it!! it takes you back to being a young teen and in love, although i never went through all that sky and holder had. this book deserves all the good things people are saying about it. from beginning to end i couldnt put the book down it was hard to guess what was going to happen next, making it a fast read. i would recommend this book to anyone!!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|First read by the author.  I found the book most enjoyable and quick to read.  Would recommend it to young adults and adults as well
B00479SVBU|4.0|Best in business ! I have used couple of products but this one is the best. Amazing sound quality and gives ability to use SD card and USB drive .
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|If your looking for a book with a one off setting for a great story this is the book to read. Really loved the way the author wrote and can't wait to read the next one!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids love this game (and so does my husband). Even my daughter, who isn't much of a gamer, finds it addicting.
B000035P5E|5.0|An excellent Donald Sutherland movie.  The initial time sequences are a bit hard to follow, with a four year jump not made clear but otherwise a very good movie.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|As good as the first time I saw it. Would watch again. bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
0545265355|2.0|I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to write one after having finished reading this trilogy.  My purpose in writing is because I am hoping that whoever writes the scripts for the ensuing movies reads these reviews.<br /><br />My wife rented the movie \\"The Hunger Games\\" and I enjoyed it so I decided to read the books.  Although I thought the style of writing was acceptable but not great, I enjoyed the story line tremendously and even told my wife as I was reading the second book that it was good, even though there was it was full of teenage romance, which, of course, she knows I don't like (although she does).  My enjoyment stopped with the last book, however.  My suggestions and criticisms:<br /><br />1)  Finnick.  The introduction of Finnick in the second book is excellent, but although he was such a major player in the second book, he is discarded in the last.  He becomes inconsequential when it is clear he is in love with a girl who has gone mad.  She should be discarded completely and he could easily become a leader, a third suitor, a mentor, anything but someone who has no use because he is lovesick.  And of course it is an insult to him that he just dies without any meaning.  He just dies.  Horrible writing.<br /><br />2)  Gale.  He starts out as the strong companion and ends up as inconsequential and heartless.  It is certainly implied that Katniss can never forgive him for the bomb that killed Primm and that Gale knows that as well.  Why?  Do we need that excuse so Katniss chooses by process of elimination?  the first book was full of teen romance and now we have none?  Doesn't fly. Gale should stay true to his character as being one who is protective of his family and Katriss and Primm and hangs on to that in the end.<br /><br />3.  Peeta.  He is such a great character until the last book. He and Primm are the good moral characters and that should stay true.  I like that he tries to kill Katriss and even the \\"real, not real\\" dialogues,but there is too little of his character development in the last book.<br /><br />4.  Primm.  She is the reason Katriss started the games.  She develops and loses her innocence, but still retains her purity.  Her death is so inconsequential it is insulting to the readers.<br /><br />5.  Coin.  She is as evil as Snow, which is intriguing.  But her evil should have been exposed.  One of the very few good parts of the third book is when katriss aims her arrow at Snow but kills Coin instead, just like the apple in the pig in the first book.  If Coin caused the deaths of innocent children she should be exposed so there is hope for the world.<br /><br />MY ENDING.  Katness sees Primm in danger and tries to rescue her, but a Peacekeeper sees her and goes after her.  Gale and Peeta both see this and Peeta rescues Katriss and Gale rescues Primm, but Gale dies in the process.  Peeta fulfills his role as always keeping Kariss alive,  Gale fulfills his role in looking after Katriss's sister and of course katriss ends up with Peeta.  Coin's misdeeds are exposed and Katriss is praised for her heroism.  Katriss, Peeta and Primm all move to Finnick's district and live happily ever after.  Finnick  eventually ends up as the President and the country at last has peace and a good leader.  Some may say it is a trite fairy-tale ending, but I am a 58 year old male, who has little use for chick flicks or romance novels, but this tale needs a happy ending!<br /><br />MY CRIICISM.  The last book ends hope.  It is almost a modern Les Miserables, but even in Les Miserables Cosette finds happiness and Jean ValJean is at peace knowing she is happy.  This book lacks the character and hope of Les Miserables and leaves us with just an empty feeling.  Not a good way to end a story or a film.<br /><br />I am hoping for some good movies from this story, because it could be good, but it can't be like the book.  To quote my granddaughters:  \\"That ending just sucks.\\"

0345803493|5.0|I don't get into books very often but when I do, and once catches me I'm stuck!!  Fifty shades of grey had me by the pages, I couldn't put it down.  It's a must read!!!!

B003ODIZL6|5.0|Why I picked this rate is because  I learned new words.<br />I will recommend this because I love it I can look up words when I want to.
B00005Y6YB|1.0|The discs looked great and the first one played great. The second one will not play at all. I was surprised to have a problem because they were so clean.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was surprisingly good! It's out of my normal reading material but I was very well pleased. It was interesting and had several twists that I was not expecting. Kept me very interested and entertained! I would suggest giving it a try!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This season is just as good as season 1.  Obviously the plots are completely different, but the concept of &#34;horror&#34; is still successful.  I highly recommend watching this.  You can't find anything this creative or dark on TV these days.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Addictive and challenging... I would recommend to anyone... Love it... Sometimes makes my brain hurt trying to figure out the strategy..
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I don't watch these movies. My girl does.. and I know she wanted this box set... so I got it for her as a gift.
B0014DQSGW|4.0|This movie would have been terrible if not for Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.  The story is predictable and your typical &#34;meh&#34; rom-com, but the two leads make the merely decent material into a cute and enjoyable movie.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is a very clever and insightful look into the perils of marriage and the darker unknown sides of peoples psyches. The author has an uncanny ability to understand how people think within relationships. It's both amusing and dark, the best book I've read in years!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the 1st.  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for the movie to see how it compares.
1936608618|5.0|I have been crossfiting for 4 years and running for 20.  You think you know what you are doing, and then you read this book....awesome! Best explanation of the POSE method.  Simplified and broke down everything. Although it was hard for me to undo poor habits, I PR'd my times on my runs.  Very worth the money.  Can't wait to study the swim section!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Addictive.  Really enjoyed it.  Could not wait to get to the next book in the series.  It is a must read.  I saw the movie 1st and some parts of the book are better.
B001AZFO14|5.0|I saw this movie for a very first time long time ago (10 years ago) and found out was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Since cannot help to watch it over and over again, so good, just love it!!! I would not rate a movie with 5 stars if this one isn't an excellent movie to me as this one is, love the actors and everything else.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't like the ending.  I thought Katniss wound up with the wrong guy.  Otherwise it was a good story.
B004GYY714|5.0|It's an excellent app, I use it almost every day. I wish I had the option to move it to my SD card, instead of having it in my phone  internal storage
B000M3DX7C|4.0|I love S&G.  I don't know if this rates as a favorite, but it's certainly good and worth having in your collection.
0375703764|5.0|I read House of Leaves, oh, almost three years ago, during exam week while I was a senior in college and had some time to kill. I noted the irregularities in printing, the way the word \\"house\\" was highlighted everywhere that it was used, the several unusual additions, such as sheet music and several pages of apparently random objects, and I thought, \\"Hey, this looks kind of cool\\". I picked it up in the afternoon, read it in the bright, sunny quad until it started to get dark, went back to my dorm, read for most of the night, finished it, turned every single light in my room on, and went to sleep. I continued to sleep with every light in my room on for the next three days. About a week later, I mailed the book to a friend who had expressed a desire to read it, pleased to have gotten rid of it and hating it intensely.<br /><br />And yet, after nearly three years of reflecting back on this book when I think of innovation, effective horror, and effective writing, I have been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that it is, in fact, a good book.<br /><br />WHY is it a good book? I could talk about the gritty and very human characterization that is a staple of postmodern literature, the plotting, or the cleverness of construction, but although those are all important and superbly done, talking about them completely fails to convey what makes this book special. This book is a feeling, an immersive experience, a book that makes you, the reader, feel like a part of the story, just one more frame in the interlocking puzzle box of narratives. It is one of the very best horror novels that I have ever read.<br /><br />I am not, in general, a fan of postmodern literature, simply because it so often doesn't work. This is not one of those books that doesn't work. It does require a certain amount of commitment. I generally read very quickly, but this book took a day and a night, simply because the arrangement of the book tends to necessitate a great deal of back-tracking, cross-indexing, looking carefully through the various additions and pictures and so on. I recommend reading it that way if you have the endurance. Later sections are probably enhanced by a certain amount of sleep deprivation, though there may be something to be said for the slow, steady, creeping horror style of reading as well. It is rather long, but never dull, as long postmodern books are occasionally prone to be (I'm looking at you, Endless Jest). This book is worth the effort, but you have to trust that it's worth it- and perhaps, for some people, it won't be. I recall a friend's response when I tried to describe the book's structure to him- \\"That just sounds silly\\". I suspect a lot of people will feel that way. It's long. It's convoluted. It is not-your-average-novel. If any of those turn you off, you may very well not like this book.<br /><br />But it might grow on you, like some Lovecraftian creeping moss from space. You never know.  I'm buying my second copy once I finish this review. If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend investing in a first.xing, looking carefully through the various additions and pictures and so on.

B002SFAV4U|4.0|I love Pink Floyd, and I love David Gilmour as a solo act as well.  He is an amazing talent and I personally think he's very underrated by people who aren't Pink Floyd fans.
B001UEBHYS|4.0|Great movie.  Most people I know shy from foreign films.  This should be their first exception.  Played great as advertised.  Very easy on screen transaction after simpla account set up.  Good communication. Will use again.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I am also one of the people who received a counterfeit LifeProof case.  I have had a LifeProof case before and this was NOTHING like the true and actual LifeProof case.  I checked the serial numbers after reading other reviews, and yes, it is a fake case.  I have had similar problems like other buyers of the fake cases.  Shoddy construction, parts falling apart  off the case, thin plastic and hard plastic around the outside instead of the rubber for the exterior(which is what a REAL LifeProof case has) . It is a terrible fake so I hope this will help others not get sucked into this deal and have the counterfeit case.
0151008116|5.0|No surprises, just as advertised. Nice colorfully illistrated cover over a nice hardcover. I am sure I will enjoy reading this book, before seeing the movie. I figure if ever the world should have to do without electricity, I will need a good library.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Could not use this with my kindle , really not sure what it does?, not recommended no use, maybe good on othe equipment.
B00000251N|5.0|This soundtrack has always been my favorite.  It is very peaceful and smoothing to listen to.  I would recommend this DVD, especially to those who are Neil Diamond fans!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I guess this is working for me seems to help with some documents, I do recommend this free download to everyone.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|Great Movie, acting story, I really enjoyed this, and ended up ordering it for my dad as a Christmas gift. Buy it, watch it, you'll like it.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Package arrived on time no problems, price was great , Movie was GREAT!!!, This is the only way to buy movies!!!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|For some reason this controller is awesome. I love the feel of it and it's different feeling from your regular ps3 controller.<br />I give it all 5 rating<br />Great controller
B0074MTTEK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The writing is clear, accessible, and not overly technical.  I found it to also be very engaging and even quite funny.  It is well-balanced,  so that the reader understands the importance of epigenetics but also the limits in our current understanding (which, as another reviewer pointed out, will probably change dramatically over the next few years).  Carey's descriptions of how we know what we know really helped me appreciate the scientific process and the importance of creative thinking,<br /><br />I am a statistician by training who analyzes genetic and epigenetic data but often fails to understand its significance. This book really motivated me to learn more and was an all-around good read.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Take the time to read this great book.  Great story about history of Apple and Steve jobs.  Well worth it!
B007YNBOJM|5.0|Teenager enjoying this product emensly!!!  Arrived on time and as promised.  Functioning as promised.  Does drain batteries easily.  Keep a stock of batteries at hand.  Does let you know when the batteries are low.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Covers all the pieces including setup, programming, and gpio interface. It's a great place to start, giving lots of clues and resources for more info.  I especially liked the Linux primer, it really helped me feel comfortable messing around with the OS.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Bought this one for my teenager.  She is taking stage and movie special effects course from one of the makeup artists from this movie.  Loved the sprinkling of big name stars and the geographical locations in the movie.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Easy to access.  Choice of difficulty.  Choice of play.  Pretty much the same as any other chess game.  It's still good for 3 stars (three stars).
B005K0HDGE|2.0|While I had high hopes for this book, it did not deliver.<br />I feel the writer got bored with the novel and wrote a hurry up ending. Very disappointing.<br />If you have nothing else to read or can get at a discount go for it, otherwise you're not missing much.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Bought this product based on the 1200 or so 5 star reviews - I don't know who writes all of those, but my experience is that this product is FAKE & DEFECTIVE - First couple of times it worked fine - I didn't use it very much during the first couple of weeks - Then I started playing games with it every day. With regular use, one by one buttons have failed, and now it does not work at all - By the time I realized it was no good, it was already too late to return it - With a little inspection, comparing it to the original PS3 remote I was using it to replace, it is clear that this is a cheap knock-off - There is no SONY plaque on the back with serial numbers - The \\"triangle\\" key stopped working first, then the SONY button got stuck - Now it stays with all lights steady red, and nothing functions at all -<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - THEIR AD IS VERY MISLEADING - YOU WILL REGRET SPENDING YOUR MONEY WITH THESE PEOPLE
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I think this album follows \\"Down On the Upside\\" so well it's hard to believe there were so many years in between. They're sill able to navigate unusual structures and odd time signatures and make it all sound natural, a huge inspiration to my group (Coincidence Machine.net) and anyone wanting to make interesting and emotional music.<br />Twang!<br />[[ASIN:B008OI3U2K Upside Out]]
B004N66XYE|5.0|As I have already submitted that I waiting for season three with baited breath, I own the first two seasons and can't wait for season three.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Rush has been (and still is) such an inspiration to musicians and music lover's like me [[ASIN:B008OI3U2K Upside Out]]. Their commitment to high level music is still evident on this record, as well as what sounds to me like more of a Soundgarden and Black Sabbath influence, which I've never heard in their music previously.  My only complaint is that the album is mastered too hot, and tends to distort in almost any system I play it in (especially on my iPod). I wish they'd checked the sound in iPod headphones before putting it to print.  Twang!  [...]
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Easy read. Interesting dynamics between characters. It gives you encouragement during dark times. Harold is an inspiration. Human nature is to love and be needed.
B0058O84G0|5.0|I enjoyed&#34; The Fall of the Giants&#34; enormously.  The author has succeeded in capturing my attention at all times.  Am now looking forward to the next book of the Triolgy.
B00A5052YE|4.0|I love Alicia Keys. She's just about my favorite singer. I didn't like this album so much when I first got it, but it grew on me. Girl on Fire, Tears Always Win, Not Even The King, and That's When I Knew were my favorite tracks.
B00936A0RU|5.0|The movie should be called Lawful.  I gave it 5 stars because it is based on real events and in a neighboring state.  Even though I purchased it for a friend and I for Christmas, I have not actually watched it.,
1442419814|4.0|This book was a very good book in my opinon. This book is about Tally-a fifteen year old girl who is about to turn 16 and become \\"pretty\\". Becoming pretty in this civilization is a part of life. When you become pretty you get a surgical procedure to be a certian body size and new facial features. Tally is ready to become pretty and meet up with her friends who have already become pretty. She wants to be friends with Peris- the one best friend she had- again. Now that Peris is pretty and living in New Pretty Town, she is alone to pull tricks while she is still an \\"uglie\\" until she meets Shay- a girl set on running to the Smoak and not become pretty. Shay and Tally become friends in no time. When Tally lets Shay leave in search of David- the one person to take her to the Smoke- alone, she plans on becoming pretty once she is 16, but Dr.Cable- a Special Circumstances worker- tells Tally she either go look for the Smoke on her own or be ugly forever, Tally goes searching for the Smoke. Join Tally on her journy to the Smoke, the people she meets and what happens when the one thing she decides she does not want to happen happens. In my opinon this book was great. It kept my interest and was an easy read. Also the storyline kept moving with twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />This book starts with Tally as the trickster who can break into New Pretty Town without getting caught, to when Tally heads to the Smoke insearch of turing Shay and the other people at the Smoak over to Dr.Cable, to when she causes the biggest problem the Smoak has faced. I found that once I started reading, I didn't want to put the book down. I wanted to know what was around the next corner and where Tally would end up. I always thought I knew what would happen next but there were big suprises at the end. I also found the book to keep my attention whether I was around people or by my self, I didn't wan to stop reading until it was over, even then I wanted to start the next book in the series right away.<br /><br />The storyline progresses as Tally starts to think about how life will be after she becomes Pretty. How she wont have uglie problems and life will be a big party. The book changes as Tally learns new things about the place she thought she new so well. There are bigger problems that occure then what Tally initially realizes. As she meets people in the Smoke feelings and trust arise. Tally makes moves that she thinks are small and helpful but become huge and harmful, but the ending of the book is the biggest change you would expect Tally to make.<br /><br />In my opion this book gets a thumbs up because it was a book I really enjoyed reading. I would recomend it to anyone who asked me. I think you should definetly read this book.
1476704163|5.0|if you love Ke$ha and have heard her new album Warrior, READ THIS. great background on how she became famous and touring life, and vacations. more of a photojournal.
B00362FO0K|5.0|What can I say.about this bluray it goes on behind the scenes and shows how hard micheal works and make sure everything is perfect for his concerts it's a must for all fans of micheal jackson
B009EP3DJM|5.0|if youre an animal, this is wonderful. extra songs really make the album! crazier than the previous 2 albums and so great. great for dancing.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Do you really have to ask?? This movie is amazing. Arrived on time and in perfect condition, even though it was used. One of my favorites.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|package was damaged and it was a cardboard DVD box instead of a plastic hard case which is what I thought I was purchasing
B00008K7AM|5.0|This movie is funny! Rachel McAdams is hilarious in this film and Rob Schneider is as well! If you're bored or if you like schtick comedy, pick it up!
B005XI9456|5.0|I loved the variety of songs from being slow and mellow to upbeat! This album felt mature and youthful at the same time.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Okay, I love this film and had obviously seen it before - one thing I will say that I really DID NOT love about it was the fact that on the spine of the DVD, it does not have Harry's picture and &#34;year 7 part 2&#34; at the top of the spine as the rest of the films do. It really ruins the ambiance and feel of the collection when they're all displayed together. The film however, is magnificent!
B00005JPKE|5.0|The other guys point of view in one of the most costly american battles in modern war fare. It is a must see. If you saw Flags of our Father, you must see this.
B002R68U7K|5.0|This is, by far, one of the most amazing things Britney has ever decided to release! Though it is lacking in current-Britney-era new music, if you were too young to buy all the singles, they are recreated here with the original artwork and b-sides/bonuses! I'd recommend this to ANY Britney fan as she is sure to be around for a VERY VERY long time and this would make a great piece in your collection!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|....but it definitely could have been written better.  It's as if it's written young adults, but by NO means should anyone under the age of 18 ever have access to this book!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Okay, without getting too wordy here -- all of the men in this movie are GORGEOUS! Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, Adam Rodriguez - WHO WOULDN'T WANT ALL THIS?! It's a straight girl/gay guy's DREAM! However, once you start watching the film, it's not as glamorous as all the commercials made it out to be. It starts VERY slow and this film shows you just how bad an actor Channing Tatum can be... the first scene with the two girls is atrocious but he gets better. The plot is thin, 54/Boogie Nights-ish drug and sex romp that doesn't compare to the other &#34;party pleaser&#34; films it tries to emulate. The dancing is on point, thought there's only perhaps 20 minutes of dancing throughout the whole film. My suggestion? Redbox it, call it a night!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so glad that I read the second book....it's been over a year since I read the first and then saw the movie.  Can't wait to get my hands on the third.  I have a hard time with trilogies when I finish the second book I wait a while before starting the third, especially if I am enjoying it.  I don't like them to end!!
6305903182|5.0|When Scream 4 came out last year, I had to upgrade from the old VHS tapes and get all the collector's edition DVD's of the Scream set! I found the first two at a local retailer for competitively priced, but had no such luck with the third. AMAZON TO THE RESCUE! Fun bonus features and EXTREMELY quick [I selected 3-5 business day shipping] shipping service!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|First time I seen this movie, it was great, Blu ray was awesome! I recommend this to everyone that likes comic book movies.
B003Y5H574|4.0|SPOILERS HEREIN!!!! The cast is great - Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are darling together and Steve Carrell [an actor I DO NOT care for] is WONDERFUL with Julianne Moore. Crazy Stupid Love feels a little like those ensemble films that came out a while ago [He's Just Not That Into You, Valentine's Day, New Years Eve] that all play off of interesting character relationships and funny revelations about how characters are connected. The film is a great effort with expert casting and is amazingly acted and worth your time, but unfortunately once you see it, I don't know if you'll want to watch it all the time. It's got a 6 to 10 view life span sadly!
B008RZF1UO|4.0|The CD itself is slightly below average for Kamelot: general crowd-pleaser, nothing really in the rock-your-world category. Eh, every band has a release or two like that, so no biggie. Usually means the next release has a couple outstanding tracks on it.<br /><br />The box and contents is where this pack really pulls its weight. The box is every bit as stunning as the picture, but the box art is only skin deep. Inside, you get a small pamphlet / CD case insert, a small story book, and some other odds and ends. The story book that matches the songs is the real treat here, when combined with the full kit it makes for an interesting read while you listen experience.<br /><br />All in all, if you are interested in the full package (or are a serious fan of Kamelot), go for the box. If you're just after the tracks, hit up Amazon MP3.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 3 year old boy LOVES this app.  Great for waiting in a doctors office.  It holds his attentionfor a good amount of time
B000I8G5NA|3.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee are still fun to watch but the story line is a bit predictable and way too many gross alien figures.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son set me up on this and asked me to give it a shot. I found it a lot of fun and surprisingly entertaining. Who comes up with these games? Anyway thanks for the giggles.
0756666937|2.0|My son loves legos. Based on the description (both my wife and I read it at different times and got the same impression) we thought it was going to be a book on how to build miscellaneous objects with miscellaneous left over lego pieces. It is not. It is merely a book that shows every Lego kit ever made with a picture of it put together (which by the way you can find this online for free). So if you want to spend twentysome dollars on something you can find on line for free .... then this book is for you :-)!

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|While not for the squeamish, Dredd 3D is an effectively gritty B movie accentuated by stylish visuals and irreverent humor.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|The plot is absolutely ridiculous and there are long stretches that move at a snails crawl. On the Plus side the film is beautifully shot and the location in Venice is a treat to watch.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be a Comedy? Not so, other reviewers compare it to Hitchcock flicks but, if so, this is a lame attempt at the genre.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I have always liked Linkin Park anyway, and was familiar from the radio with this album's hit Burn It Down.  I wasn't sure how the rest of the songs would be, but was not disappointed.  Buying the album is not a bad investment for people who like LP's earlier offerings, especially with Burn it Down.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Such a tragic story. To gain all the knowledge in the world, Charlie's dream, and to have it slip away, all while being aware of what is happening, is tragic. So heartbreaking. Loved the book. So much I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|If you like bloody violence, this is the book for you: lots of psychopathic killers; a witless, Harvard-educated detective; and a giggling girlfriend who melts our hero's heart, who is himself only one remove from a psychopath himself.  The plot also leaks: it hinges on a incredible coincidence and an unexplained first cause.  Or maybe I just missed why the bad guys arrested Reacher in the first place.  Just a few of the things that bothered me, but, as I said, if you like bloody violence, you can overlook all this stuff.

0307592731|5.0|Throughout history, individuals have withdrawn from society for various reasons.  Some do so to find a deeper connection with the Transcendent, others seek communion with the universe, some do so because being near people is too overwhelming.  Those who are driven to a time of prolonged isolation are often seeking to escape from or to come to grips with the pain they are presently facing.  When Cheryl Strayed's mother died within 43 days of being diagnosed with Lung Cancer, her life seemed to become unmoored.  She started a series of \\"one, two or three night stands\\" while proclaiming to love the man she married only three years previously, began dallying with heroin and worked managed to find herself in deep financial trouble without a degree (because she had not written a paper for a Sophomore level English class).  In the midst of her making these poor decisions, she became aware, and decided to hike a large portion, of the Pacific Crest Trail, a 2600 mile path that goes from the border of Mexico to the border of Canada.<br /> Most who decide to make this monumental hike spend years planning and months training before attempting such an arduous trek.  The time from conception of the idea to her setting foot on the trail was six-months.  She had a little day hiking experience and her step-father had taught her some camp-craft, beyond that her preparation was an awareness that this was something she had to do.  What she learned on this endeavor took her 17 years to distill and put into a book.  After reading this very well done memoir, I am delighted she undertook such a task, was able to write so eloquently about it and allowed me to experience the rigors of hiking the PCT in the comfort of my easy chair.<br /> When she began her hike, the author was deeply wounded - by the death of her mother, the disintegration of her immediate family, the end of her marriage and the lack of any direction for her life.  When she strapped on \\"Monster\\" (the name she gave her back pack), she found it weighed nearly half her body weight and that she could not lift it without help.  Eventually she both gained strength and learned what she could do without and the load she carried was easier, but it never became as small as what the hikers she met carried.  Her boots, which fit perfectly when she tried them on in the outfitting store, proved to be too small causing excruciating foot pain that continued after she obtained boots that actually fit.<br />The reality of the over-weight backpack and the ill-fitting shoes proved to be the metaphor of the book.  The load with which she began the life-changing journey lightened, but never left her, rather it became an accepted and acceptable part of her world.  The pain she suffered, often with every step, was due to her poor choices, yet she did not allow those choices to stop her from what she had to do.  Her time on the PCT was spent walking and remembering moments in her life (told in flashbacks) that had brought her to the place of needing to be alone and had created the \\"path\\" by which she would find herself.  Some of the memories are heartbreaking, some hilarious, a few perilous but all formed the person that walked from Mexico to the border of Oregon and Washington.<br />The book had a deeply Spiritual flavor to it, although Ms. Strayed lone reference to God was less than Worshipful.  She is painfully transparent about her life no excuse nor asking forgiveness for any of the choices she made, only displaying acceptance of herself in the humble Grace found in those who know they are loved in spite of themselves.  Anyone interested in: hiking, self-discovery, \\"spiritual\\" journeys or want a very good book to read.<br />Ms. Strayed made the 1100-mile hike so interesting that I found myself wondering if I could achieve such a task.  Being outdoors (in all weathers), communing with nature (not bathing for weeks), sleeping in a tent in a bag (with little padding), eating el Fresco (dehydrated meals cooked over a small stove), finally arriving at the end of the journey having only four toe-nails left.  On further thought, I will read of such deeds from the comfort of my world and be thankful for those who share the trip with me.

0143120530|4.0|Josh Foer, a then-recently graduated Journalism student, covered the 2004 U.S. Memory Championship for a popular culture magazine.  What he saw in covering that event was intriguing; he found \\"a bunch of guys (and a few ladies) . . . poring over pages of random numbers and long lists of words\\" (p.8) which they would then recite, from memory.  The winner being, for this event (there were five for the Championship), the individual who could recall the largest number of words and numbers. By the end of the tournament, he had witnessed: the recitation a previously unpublished poem by the participants, recall the faces and names of 99 photographic headshots and as many of 300 random words as possible in 15 minutes, plus as many of 1000 random digits (253 was the winner) and recall the order of a shuffled deck of cards with only 5 minutes preparation.  Witnessing these \\"Mental Athletes,\\" (MA's) was amazing and something he wanted to learn more about.  He spent the next year learning and training to participate in the 2005 U.S. Memory Championship.<br /> This book is a history of memory and an account of Mr. Foer's preparation for the championship, it is not a manual for learning how to have better recall.  He learns, and relates, that memory is something that can be improved if one understands how humans remember.  The historical research he gives is absorbing as he starts with the 5th Century B.C. Greek poet Simonides, the first to use the technique of memory utilized by the MA's in the championships.  The technique is called a \\"Memory Palace,\\" where the individual creates a graphic image of what needs to be recalled and placing those images around a familiar (held in the mind) location.  All one needs to do to recall is \\"visit\\" the stated palace and \\"see\\" the items.  Of course, the process is more complicated and requires practice but is surprisingly easy to comprehend and begin to utilize.<br /> The need for such \\"memory aids,\\" was created in when the ability to read was extremely rare.  Knowledge, history, folk lore - any needed information - was passed down by Oral Tradition (from mouth to ear) and had to be recalled with a fine measure of accuracy.  Since words were more representative then than in a culture where they are read, they were \\"seen\\" as images within the imagination of the learner.  Therefore, the concept of developing images for what one needs to recall would have been a far less exotic concept for those in the past than those of us in the computer age.  Our ancestors understood inherently that we can \\"only understand what (we) can visualize\\" (p.33) and \\"we don't remember isolated facts, we remember in context\\" (p.65).  Chapter Five offers an insight into this process as the reader gets to \\"learn\\" of the Memory Palace along with the author.  In that short introduction, I was able to accomplish the memorization of a list of random words by using this technique.<br /> \\"SPOILER ALERT!\\"  Mr. Foer won the 2005 U.S. Memory Championship, setting a new record for recalling the order of a shuffled deck of cards (in 1 minute 40 seconds).  He did not fare as well in the World Championships (where it is not unusual for participants to recall a shuffled deck in 30 seconds).  He choose not to return to defend his championship, as to do so would require more time than he was willing to commit.<br />Upon reflection, he found that his memory had not improved through the training as a Mental Athlete - he still misplaced his keys, had trouble remembering names, etc..  Yet he also felt the effort had changed him nonetheless.  What he did comprehend that the most important thing about having a better memory and the common denominator in all of the training exercises was the MA's were \\"mindful of\\" (they paid attention to) what they wanted to remember.  Anyone can have a better memory.  None of the participants in the memory championships had extraordinary memories, they had just learned to pay closer attention to what they put in their\\"Memory Palace.\\"

1401322786|5.0|There are many people who write well, there are gifted storytellers; when the two are found in the same person the resulting prose is poetic in its ability to speak to the reader on the deepest levels of one's soul while using the simplest of language.  Mitch Albom proves himself to possess these dual abilities in this small, but powerful, parable of time, life, living, love and the power to celebrate eternity in the space between breaths.<br /> The idea of time is a relatively recent concept.  When humanity began keeping track of the passing of days, probably in order to have some measure of control of one's environment, we also began a desire to \\"hoard\\" time and began considering the passing of time to be of more importance than the timeless moment.  Mr. Albom does a superb job of bringing this hugely pondered idea (volumes have been written on various aspects of time) into a thought-provoking, easily comprehended, enjoyable allegory and takes only 220 (small) pages to accomplish the task.<br /> Before there was time, people enjoyed life as it came.  Planting, hunting, talking, arguing, laughing, watching were occurrences unnoticed as there was no cause to measure their existence.  Someone (in this book, a man named Dor), did notice a \\"moment\\" and became aware that there would another \\"moment\\" the next day.  He began to measure moments/hours/days/weeks/seasons to the point of distraction from all other endeavors.  Dor's knowledge caused him to want more of what was never needed to be known (time) first begging God for more time with his beloved Alli, then cursing God when that wish was not granted.  As a result of his actions he was sealed in a cave for the next 6000 years, listening to the ever increasing voices of the world who were asking for time to be changed (more, slowed,  rewound) until he learns the \\"lesson\\" of time.  His task will be accomplished when he has taught two people, one wanting more time, one desiring less, the lessons he learned.<br /> Thesefew pages are packed with wisdom of The Moment.  Mr. Albom acknowledges God's influence in his life, but this work is not preachy, religious nor does it seek to convert those to read it to anything beyond becoming aware of the riches to be found in the absence of marking time.  To become aware, to quote Kipling, \\"of the everlasting moment\\" holds all one desires, hopes for and can \\"possess\\" is the aim of this read.<br /> I make my living \\"measuring time\\" (appointments are scheduled, limited in length, regular in their being proffered) and own more instruments to keep track of its passing than I care to count.  I have never been able to save/spend/take out/waste/keep time except by measuring the anxiety I experience as I attempt any of those.  My \\"addiction\\" to time is deep and, I fear, terminal.  What I am learning, and this book is a welcome lesson in this particular tutorial, is that there are places where time becomes irrelevant - holding Wyndee's hand, playing with children, eating good food, laughing with friends, feeling the sun/rain - and those are the places where I truly am living.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Many other reviews have done a great job of explaining just why Redline is something of a must-see, so I'll just throw in a few words on the matter myself. Every once in a few years an animated movie comes along that's sheer originality, energy, and sense of immersion serves as a reminder of how great the medium can be, including to people who usually aren't especially into animated films. Redline is one of these. Redline is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movies I've seen in long time. It's the sort of movie the appeal of which is hard to explain; \\"Racing cars on an alien world with explosions and colors\\" isn't likely to get to many people willing to watch it with you. Really, it's one of those films that you have to say to your friends \\"just trust me,\\" and stick the disc in. This is what I've done every time I've shown Redline, and whatever skepticism people have tends to disappear in seconds as the adrenaline-cranking wildly creative first race bursts on to the screen with it's pulsating techno beat, full of insane and inventive alien characters. And the attention never wanes. One of the best things about the entire movie, and the reason why the ridiculous action is so effecting, is that each and every character in the huge cast is unique and strangely lovable. They each get their moments to shine in their own peculiarities, and while Redline is far from deep in a very self-aware way, the characters shine through like a beacon. The result of the  crazy inventive animation, literally edge of your seat racing, and strangely lovable characters really is one incredible film that I frankly don't see myself getting tired of watching anytime soon.<br />Do yourself a favor, and watch Redline.

B008EKOO46|4.0|A look at &#34;traditional societies&#34; through the eyes of a disciplined academic equipped with a variety of professional tools. Diamond traces the development of states from clans, tribes and chiefdoms. Along the way he describes traits and characteristics of those various social organizations, and which of those traits and characteristics have prospective salutary prospects of those of us who live in centralized, bureaucratized states (within which are communities that in some such respects are more like clans or tribes).<br /><br />I live in a town of about 2,500 permanent residents that behaves in some essential ways like a tribal society. It has a core of families with continuous descent spanning 7 or 8 generations and dating from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The post office doesn't deliver mail, we all have to go and get it. There are no traffic signals, no movie theatre, no fast food franchises, a K-12 school. It is an island accessible only by ferry or private boat.<br /><br />A lifetime in most of the world until yesterday did have its nasty and brutish aspects, and it was generally short. But child-rearing, decision-making, routine health care and providing for food, and protection against inclement weather or seasonal variations were mediated almost exclusively within the community. Diamond's look at such things, and his ideas on whether and/or how they can or should be considered in a state society, is a welcome and worthwhile read.

I wish it had more of a variety of puzzles, that's why I have 4 stars. Also, you only get about 4 puzzles, otherwise the rest cost $1.99. And yes, I felt bad that he couldn't play more so I bought the whole app. He asks to play it all the time, and when the puzzle is done right you get pictures of ballons celebrating.

0765325950|1.0|In not releasing the electric version Harriet has not only shown her ignorance but a total disregard for her late husband fan base. When Robert was alive I anxiously looked forward to each new release. I felt almost a kindred spirit with him. I now wish I had never started them.<br />Harriet's greed and selfishness has put a taint the whole series. Thank goodness most authors are not of this nature (Of course she's not an author).<br /><br />A postscript ... I was irritated enough by this that I borrowed the book from a friend to avoid Harriet getting credit for a sale as well as my money.<br />After 20 something years of reading this series I was diappointed with the ending. I found the to be very tedious. I thought it was the weakest of all the books.
0345803485|5.0|Skip the sappy love story. You don't need to pay a lot of attention to that. The sex scenes are sizzling and very hot. It's not real deep, no work of Shakespeare, no masterpiece. But it is a trashy little read. Let the imagination sore and soon you'll want to act all freaky before you know it.

B0031RS2HC|4.0|I liked this read as it was easy enough to keep track of the characters and what was going on with them. It wasn't too taxing on the brain and would be suitable for a holiday read or one for the bed stand to read over a week or so before going to sleep at night. I found one or two of the plot twists a little predictable, but over all, enjoyed the read. There were a couple of nights where I ended up reading a little longer than intended just to see how a situation played out. It was my first time to read a Jack Reacher story, but I have now started the second one as a result of reading this one...

B0051MKMNC|5.0|&#34;Limitless&#34; was a very good movie with an original plotline and overarc. Physically, the packaging came in the yellow bubble mailer and was very expeditious. My wife and I had seen this in the past, although I cannot remember where, and we wanted it on Bluray due to the awesome quality of course but it was and has been very expensive. So, I've kept my eyes open for this one to drop and as always Amazon came through with a great deal.<br /><br />Andrew
B0063IH60K|5.0|FUN. . . and sometimes I even win!!!  Card games are my free time  choice.  So, having this game on my Kindle makes it readily availabe.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|This box set has caused me quite a bit of stress and lost time.  As all the other reviews will state, the set has superb packaging and design.  My son and I were lured to this because of the chance to own every Beatles album with the original packaging without the expense and research of tracking down originals.  Everything looks great.<br /><br />Now to what most have complained of: THE PRESSING.  Whoever was in charge of this should be fired.  We got the first set for Christmas.  Most of the records would have been great quality if they were 40 years old and used.  But skips and off center pressings aren't acceptable for new records.  No problem- Amazon sent a new one and I sent the other one back.  That was my first mistake.  Started going thru them, in reverse order, since the later releases seem to have the most problems.  Abbey Road- boom, skip, skip, skip.  Called Amazon and explained and they noted that it was a known issue and would overnight another set(yep, number 3).  Being the weekend, I decided to go thru all the records and inventory every noise, skip, etc.  I figured that if I couldn't get one perfect set, maybe I could make one from multiple sets.<br /><br />Third set arrived and I spent the week going thru it.  Only one defect in it: Let It Be was off center and made the track unplayable.  No problem- switched it with the one from the second set.  Every other record is good to go.  So don't be discouraged if you get a bad set, just be patient.  It is a lot of work and should be compensated by EMI in my opinion, but i digress.<br /><br />ONE OTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:  As part of the poor pressing, there is a film all over every record.  If you leave this alone, the records will skip intermittently.  What I did was take a microfiber cloth and wipe (applying more pressure than you'd think) around the record in both directions several times.  This may seem silly, but on every single record I tested it out.  Played untouched with crappy response, then wipedand replayed to a perfect response.<br /><br />Again, great set if you are patient of luck into a perfect set first time.  I'm okay with that.  I have every studio record in pristine condition from a band that hasn't recorded in 40+ years.

Ive been switching between angry birds and plague for a couple of weeks.  it good food for thought.  theres not really anything wrong with it.  it wasnt intended to blow anyones mind, just entertain.  you can watch tv while playing, even make a phone call.  Its fun.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love love love this movie and what's even better is that it shipped very quickly and I was so excited when it came.  Came in plastic wrap just like a new DVD should, and the DVD was great no scratches or anything.  Also came with two booklets in it that advertised HP merchandise.  Totally buy it .
B009HNDTPO|5.0|Love this show! Been watching it since its inception! :) Would recommend to anyone to watch it! They won't be sorry
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i wanted a game where I am able to beat the lower levels or first level<br />but would provide a challenge as I improved.  i can ONLY beat the first level,<br />which is perfect for me.  Play is smooth and it is reall easy to use.<br />The menu button is really small for a touchscreen though.  This is<br />too minor to worry about.  Great overall!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I was at a testeront the lady told me all about it so I played it and now I cant give it up I have to get back to it.
0723257639|5.0|This book collection was purchased in conjunction with Peter Rabbit for our new nephew. His parents were pleased with the gift, and we received a big thank you.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I am a Rod Stewart fan and was delighted to see  that he finally released  a Christmas CD. He has his very own style of singing and has, once  again, outdone himself. I would recommend this  CD to all Rod Stewart fans and to anyone who wants to hear some new renditions of some folks favorites.<br />Virginia H.
B00785P2QC|5.0|i love this app so much. the game is cool and it is fun whe  i am bored because idk but yeab i really lkke it it is kool so get the apphu
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble has, at times, that &#34;bad boy&#34; look, but all that disappears when he sings the very first note of a song.His Christmas CD has a variety of music on it, each song  sung in his own inimitable style. He sings with such clarity that every word can be clearly understood, a definite plus enabling the listener to sing along. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to hear some wonderful carols, some wonderful vocal tones, and to anyone who enjoys a good vocal performance
B002QAY31Y|5.0|For those of us who learn about World War II from history classes in school and college, this is the material that provides the background and the elaboration that brings it to clarity.<br /><br />Great!  Deserving of every award it received.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a different approach to the slavery issue which shamed our country in the 18th and 19th century.  A quick read but well written.  Characters came aive.  Ended too abruptly but still worthwhile reading.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|There has to be more though!!! Omg!!!! This book is simply awesome. I had a hard time putting it down.
0810989956|5.0|My son is a big &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; fan and also loves sketching and making his own little comics.  He loves this book and a lot of the activities really get him thinking about himself, his life and his friends.  The book came packaged well and shipped quickly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is really cool. I thing its more of a nerd game. bit who would know besides me cause I'm a nerd :-) I prefer mindcraft so do waste you time gettingg this game get the mindcraft game :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)
141970642X|5.0|My son is a big &#34;Wimpy Kid&#34; fan and also talks about wanting to work in film one day, so this book was a no-brainer.  He loves reading about how the movies were made and learning the ins and outs of film making.  The book came packaged well and shipped quickly.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Mariah Carey's two Christmas CDs are two of my favorite albums for the holiday season.  I particularly like Merry Christmas II You because it mixes new songs with classics, upbeat dance-y type songs with peaceful carols.  The mash-ups are great, and I really appreciate that there are so many songs about Jesus.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I great heartfelt book. A sittting on the edge kind of book. A book you won't want to put down.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|thanks for the combo offer.  i did need it.  seems to be working perfectly.  next im going to get a new processor and i have left over for it.  combo good items and we do buy them.  *****
B0001ARCFA|5.0|There are many reviews here. Great headphones, the sound is amazing for the price, I really enjoy the music, but for movies I prefer closed cones.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! It's absolutely addicting once you start reading it! I can't wait to start the next one!
B000KIPT30|5.0|Works perfectly, small to carry, I really enjoy using them. Very comfortable for headphone that need a little bit more power.
0307341550|2.0|Gone Girl was the first of Flynn's books that I read and I loved it. The characters were flawed, but the serious issues were contained to one-two characters. I read it a second time for book club and loved it even more as I discovered the nuances in Flynn's story telling.<br /><br />I bought Sharp Objects expecting the same caliber of writing and was greatly disappointed.The storyline itself was compelling and kept my attention. However, it felt as if every character in this book had mental issues. It was like the entire town was a mental health ward. As a result, it took away from the story being told and became a gimmick to keep readers guessing who had committed the murders. I would have preferred some of the characters to have other reasons for being potential suspects.<br /><br />I did find the use of cutting to be an interesting element. I haven't heard of cutters creating words on their body and I felt that added to the book.<br /><br />Overall, this book was disturbing past the point of being enjoyable. It was as if Flynn was throwing in every disturbing thing she could come up with for the sole purpose of being disturbing. This is not a book I recommend, though I do recommend Gone Girl.
B00846REIS|5.0|I had finished reading another very popular series (fifty shades) and was lost to find another equally entertaining series. Luckily a coworker turned me on to this book. I have to say, I am hooked!  Just seemed like this book went by much faster than I would have liked. I prefer a book to take me at least a week to get through. It was well worth the time it did take to read. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hhhzhzhzzuzhhjjhuuu the government to do it was a good idea that the government has not only to the river is the best possible to the first half and legendary to the government to take advantage over to be able the river and legendary the river sea and then you see in this country has a samurai and Pakistan in this blog post on my way of life<br />.
B000VZYPB4|2.0|I watched the whole season. Videos would suddenly stop and restart at a different place. I could not find it for free which would have been preferable.
1423101499|4.0|Exciting! Twist and turns on every page for this amazing book! A must read!!! You will love this book!! Hard to put down!!!
B004RE29WW|4.0|All of the alien movies are great. They set the tone for all the genre that follow. At the prices you can buy this for now, it is nearly dumb to to not buy a copy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book!!! I could not put it down. I was mesmerized. I was waitingto get home fo work and start reading it again. It takes certain books to keep me wanting to turn the page. i have bery eceltic taste and I am down right picky. If I read the first few pages and nothing sparks my interest ; then oh wel I put it back . I have read all the required greats at school; to kill a mockingbird, Little women, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hunger Games, Stephane Myers, John Grisham, Edgar Allan Poe, E.L.James, Shiver, Linger, Rilke etc.... Just goes to show my taste are different and I adore this series!!!! Keep them coming. Thanks Amazon too!!!!  Ashleigh Etheridge
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Bought these for my wife.  She is a church organist and likes to practice quietly both at home and at the church.  The headsets are in the bag and she says they are excellent.
B00290FWYS|5.0|One of the best selections from Cafe del Mar collection (I bought at least 8 of them). Songs are great for a night with fine wine and good friends.
B002WJI66C|5.0|excellent! my son loved the super mario plush! ghost boo! would recommend this to others who has a child that likes mario
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|i have had Toy Story since it first came out.  We love watching it over and over.  Watch it when my nieces and nephews visit.  Finally wore out from overuse.  This is my second DVD
034580404X|5.0|Want more shades-all and more. Need more.  Please give us more! I keep listening over and over.  And now in print.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|way fun and addictive, play with my friends on theirs and compete as to what levels we all get on
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I've been a long-time Steely Dan fan, and saw Donald Fagen in the summer of '12 in the Dukes of September tour.  I feel this CD is more of the same for him - he does his quirky, jazzy schtick but appears to be in somewhat of a rut compared to the brilliant and original songs of Steely Dan.  Donald's first solo album The Nightfly is an all time classic, but his later ones pale in comparison.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Touching and such great actors, shows age has nothing to do with acting ability.  good one to watch more than once.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|I was in need of something new to listen to, and I saw Aimee Mann on PBS late one Saturday night.  While watching some of her videos on YouTube, I saw an ad saying she would be appearing in Cincinnati in early November 2012.  I got tickets and went to see her and thoroughly enjoyed the concert, which prompted me to buy her latest CD.  I also bought 2 other copies to give to lady friends as gifts - no feedback from them yet.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was action packed and the special effects were awesome. It also had a good story. Robert Downey was charming as usual.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Typical Clint Eastwood and I love Amy Adams but I hate Justin Timber Lake for marring the love of my life Jessica Beil. My wife says she probably does not like old guys anyway but I still hate him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was nervous about ordering this book. I was scared it was going to be page for page nastiness but what I found was a wonderful love story written by an imaginative author. Awesome read! I had to quickly order the second book as soon as I finished this one!
B002ZG999U|3.0|Just was not as exciting as the Expendables 2 which had a broader star cast did miss lee in the second one though
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending to the story but I really want to read on from Christian's point of view, that part left me hanging.
1481251880|4.0|I purchased this book on my kindle one evening and stayed up until 3:30 a.m. so I could finish it! It was so good! I felt the characters had so many qualities I could see in myself as well as my friends! The chemistry is HOOOOOTT!! The twist in the end really got to me. I loved it so much. You have to read this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the best of all three books!! So much information is revealed and many exciting scenes. Had to order book three as soon as I finished!
1439102813|4.0|Very interesting although somewhat upsetting - well written.  Anyone with  Alzheimer's in the family, or even the suspicion of it, would find helpful information in this book.
1594744769|5.0|This is a magical little book, a tale of unusually talented children, time travel and monsters, illustrated with black and white photographs. Sixteen year old Jacob is devastated when his grandfather, Abe Portman, dies in his arms, killed by.. something. Everyone says it was dogs, but Jacob saw a humanoid being that even his friend standing right there didn't see. Jacob comes to think that perhaps Abe's wild stories of an orphanage on a tiny Welsh island filled with children who could levitate, or lift huge boulders, or create fire in their hands, and that he killed monsters, just might be true after all.<br /><br />Circumstances make a trip to Wales possible-encouraged by Jacob's therapist. Once Jacob arrives on the island his grandfather spent time on during WW II, things turn out to be even weirder -and more dangerous- than his grandfather described.<br /><br />This is a lovely coming of age story as Jacob is forced to grow up abruptly. He's faced with things that not only endanger friends but challenge his entire world view. This story has been compared to the X-Men's school for mutants, but Miss Peregrine really doesn't train the kids to use their talents to fight; she's content to keep them alive and safe, isolated from the world. It's got a touch of Shangri-La, and a bit of the feel of Gaiman, but it's totally original. I hear there is a sequel in the works, which makes me very happy.
0525953728|4.0|Most of the book is interesting and the events of the Bin Laden capture and death are very explicit.  I was disappointed to find the latter part of the book takes a most unpleasant political turn.  Although the author may have wanted readers to lose respect for the President of the United States, in my case it had the effect of making me lose just a little respect for the author.  The fact that it came out during the last presidential campaign made me suspicious that the real goal of the book was not to tell the truth about the attack in Pakistan but to make the President look bad.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This was the best since the first one.  It was a very funny and made being sick bearable.  I would strongly recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this book started out pretty slow and to be honest, kind of boring. But, the third part of the book was really shocking and I found myself not being able to put it down. I guess my advice would be to just stick with it. I will say that it got pretty weird in the end, but interesting none the lease!! I will be interested to read her other two books to see if she uses the same type of psychologically demented suspense she did with Gone Girl. Also heard Reese Witherspoon may be producing the movie version of this... love her.
B00932A2MC|1.0|The main character was a boor with impulse control issues and the IQ of a walnut.  The rest of his crew was not much better.  His girl had to be a moron to feel he was worth marrying.  The only one worth watching died, Erik Skarsgard.  If you are a Skarsgard fan I would suggest watching True Blood re-runs until the show returns.  What a waste of two hours I won't get back.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This is a stereotypical Nicholas Sparks novel. I don't mean that in a bad way, just mean that it is a similar style to past books of his, so if you like other books of his I'm sure you will like this one as well. It is an easy read, perfect for vacation!
B009YU62H2|4.0|Great CD!  If I had to compare the feel of the songs to other Soundgarden music, I'd say this CD is closest to Superunknown.  Good stuff!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|After finishing the Twilight trilogy and the Hunger Games trilogy a friend recommended these books to me. I have just finished the first one and am intrigued to read on. I thought it was really an original story and am interested to find out what happens in the second and third books. I wasn't sure though if I should have read the prequel first?! Kind of confusing.
B00A12VJZM|4.0|Great purchase from Amazon MP3!  Great quality MP3 tracks.<br /><br />In my opinion (and it's a greatest hits collection, so every fan has their own opinion on which songs are &#34;hits&#34;), it's another collection that misses some good stuff:<br />Midnight Rambler<br />Bitch<br />...and a couple others I had hoped to see.<br /><br />The new songs are pretty good, too.<br /><br />Overall, the best Stones compilation yet.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thought that the third book was the best out of the three but after reading the two previous books it started to get really repetitive, especially when it came to the sex scenes. I found myself skipping over them after a while. Overall a pretty entertaining trilogy, more of a vacation read.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|This is a truly great vampire film. My main point for writing this review though, is to confirm that the subtitle issue is fixed. It gives you many options on which language/version to use when watching.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|While entertaining, I thought this trilogy was overall really repetitive. I found myself skipping over a lot of the sex scenes especially as they were the most repetitive. I kept thinking \\"why is this dumb girl still with Christian Grey?\\" I also didn't like that the span of all three books was something like two months long... everyone's sex life is exciting in the beginning... let's see what it looks like after three kids and ten years of marriage. Ha!!
B006BDHAX0|3.0|This is fun to play. It IS upside down and it's really annoying that it freezes in the middle of games, and yet the clock keeps running...sometimes. You can earn \\"achievements\\" by accomplishing various tasks. If you solve all the puzzles in 7 minutes or less, you've defeated the dragon. Well, I've defeated all 4 of the dragons. However, I don't have the achievements for finishing 1, 5, 10, or 25 games. There are 42 games in each of the 4 categories. Obviously, I've solved 1, 5, 10, and 25. Lots of kinks in this game to be worked out. Otherwise, it's fun.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It's hard to stop playing this game but you can't stop playing the game once you start. So keep playing and enjoy yourself.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|But I found this to be a sweet book, and for anyone who has ever had a dog, rings true on so many levels.,  An easy read and one to share
B0063GORYU|5.0|A game to have fun playing with hours of playing fun and enjoyment, I recomend it to anyone who purchases a kindle,
0375851569|5.0|What can you say about Dr. Seuss other than every child should have an assortment of his books.  I bought these for my granddaughter (ok maybe for me) and am looking forward to reading these to her as soon as she can sit up and for many years after!
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris it's a bitch! In a good way, haha. Me and my boyfriend ( I bought the book for him) love it! With short texts and a common language, the reader it's easy and really dealicious! We already try some recipes, like the meat loaf and it's awesome! My boyfriend its practically devouring the book, trying to learn every line that Tim has wrote. He is an amazin person, extremaly smart and become a great cooker. I hope we get there and to the others places of knowledge, to learn everything we want in a short space of time. Congrat's Tim, you've found the golden road to the heaven of acquaintance!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun to play! It's one of my favorite games to play with my kindergardner, she loves it when we get bingo.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|great game heard it was great tryed it and I liked it people who like rovio games should get this to their collection
030758836X|5.0|This book was very addictive - hard to out down and does not stop surprising the reader.  We read this for my book club and I would recommend it to anyone considering it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book.  It was so rich in detail and it made images in my mind of what this poor boy went through.  I definitely would be excited to see the movie if one comes out.
B0000013GT|5.0|This cd from the moment I put it in the deck to when i finished it I was satisfied, this duo is probably one of the mainstream artist's who still got the talent they started out with today and didn't go downhill like every other over-rated &#34;artist&#34; I always &#34;chilllllll&#34; and listen to this cd great beats, lyrics and music that will definitely make you bob your head!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first, I thought The Perks of Being a Wallflower wasn't for me. But, I ended up reading it in less than a day, which I haven't done in years. It's really an amazing story and my new favorite book. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone 13+.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|don't know much about Hendrix this is my first cd I purchased and I really liked it, but I cant help to think these aren't his best tracks of all time. Thats how it is with all these cd's that are &#34;the best of&#34; I feel like they were created by one persons opinion of what his best stuff is, regardless its a good cd and I enjoyed it.
B005LAII80|2.0|I don't know why there's so much love for this move (or so much hate for the Stallone Dredd movie frankly, which doesn't usually fare as well in ratings as it has on Amazon apparently).<br /><br />First, since I bought this for the 3D, I should say there wasn't really a moment where the 3D added to the experience for me.  Some shots kinda used it, some shots looked weirdly composited because of it, but most shots just didn't really seem to have much depth.  Maybe I'm being unfair here after only my one viewing, but I found the cinematography to be pretty poor, especially in terms of 3D composition, but also in terms of just the overall look of the movie.  It looks cheap and badly shot.  I'll rewatch it at some point and I will revise this review at that point if I feel I was wrong.<br /><br />The props don't look very good (especially not the Judges' motorcycles, and Dredd's helmet doesn't fit right or something).<br /><br />The writing is not completely terrible and the acting is mostly passable, although Urban's frown is too exaerrated a lot of the time.<br /><br />There are some interesting visual effects and some really bad ones.  There's a very uneven level of gore. Sometimes they spare the audience a gruesome image, and sometimes they shove a gore effect (of various qualities from laughably bad all the way up to good enough to be gross) in your face in a way that feels out of place to me.<br /><br />Dredd didn't seem large or imposing enough in my opinion, his voice lacked weight in some scenes, and the actor was just trying to hold his mouth the way Stallone did the whole time.  The smaller Dredd made him seem more like an underdog, which may have helped the movie, but it doesn't fit the character as far as I'm aware.<br /><br />Helmet purists seem to like that he keeps the helmet on.  Yay.  Stallone wore his helmet while in the field until he was stripped of his rank and banished.  Urban is shown without his helmet at one point in the movie while he's not inthe field, and frankly why wouldn't he be?  The real question is why would he tolerate a particularly glaring helmet-fail that's eventually addressed in the movie but only far too late.<br /><br />Also, if you're someone who hates CG blood effects, you should know this movie is shameless with them and they look awful.<br /><br />There are some questionable effects and props in the Stallone movie but, on the whole, it looks a lot better and I thought that movie was a lot more fun.  This one is a so-so action movie that  doesn't look very good and just wasn't very enjoyable to watch for me.  I don't hate the movie, but I thought it would be better than it was, despite not thinking it looked good enough to bother with in the theater.
B003MX6QPU|2.0|Wasn't bad. But wasn't great. Wouldn't watch it again. Didn't have anything that stood out to me that would be watchable again. It was so forgettable for me, that after I rented it, I remembered I had already seen it. I watched it anyways because I spent money on it. It wasn't fun to sit through twice.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Allows you to centralize a lot of social media information.  It is nicely layed out and and it is easy to surf and read.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I don't like this case at all! The screen protector does not lay against the phone, making it even more difficult to text. Like my otter box much better!! It is also too difficult to hear the speakers wth them being covered!! I am not impressed with his case at all!! Waste of money!!
B0081SRJSY|2.0|According to my Amazon account, this is not compatible with the Kindle Fire 8.9, even though a previous reviewer said it worked on the Kindle Fire (earlier version, I assume).  I am a huge fan of Carcassonne, having played it for numerous hours on my XBox 360.  Do we know when this will be compatible with the Fire 8.9?  Thank you.
1419705849|5.0|My brother is not much of a reader, but since i got him the book, he really seems to enjoy it. The packaging and timing was great. Thanks!
B008G3N71W|4.0|This story is filled with erotic fantasy and desires. Greta is introduced into the world of kinky perversion breaking her own sexual boundaries, she allows herself to be dominated.<br /><br />Fiction is fiction, it can be believable but it doesn't have to be and I found both of these arguments in this book and that is a good thing not a bad thing because I read fiction for a reason, to escape reality and to be taken into a world far from the norm. Chloe Thurlow managed to do that for me.<br /><br />This book isn't for every reader of erotica as it goes beyond the boundaries. If you are not into kink or BDSM you may feel more than a little hot under the collar. I personally like the way that this author writes. In my opinion...you either get it or you don't. Great job I enjoyed it thouroughly.
B007VYQ9G2|4.0|Interesting and informative &#34;documentary&#34; on life of Chimpanzee.<br />Tim Allen does a good running commentary.<br />Has the Disney &#34;stamp&#34; so tends to be a bit benign.<br />Good Children & Family presentation.<br />Still not as good as Discovery's &#34;Children Of The Forest&#34;, which they steadfastedly refuse to release on DVD, but can be found on VHS by searching on on-line.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Great adventure.  Loved it.  I wish there were more books following it. It should be made into a movie with the other two.
B008EKOO46|4.0|Jared Diamond consistently provides a good read, a different look at our world from the perspective of past, present, and future.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I picked up this case for my wife's kindle HD (7&#34;).  Simple design, works well and I don't worry about the attachment mechanism.  The snap in tabs that hold it work very well and keep it in place.  The lean back stand is great, and I don't worry about her putting it in her purse or bag anymore. Looks like a Moleskine at first glance.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|Nice album just a little different than some of his other stuff. Doesn't flow super well but it's not a mix album so it's not required to. Why does amazon require 20 words?
B00321MGPG|4.0|Planet Earth is a great documentary. The extensiveness of the series and amount of information provided, plus the high-definition quality makes it an excellent purchase.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|If you like action, you'll like this film. A different take on Robin Hood nicely put together by director Ridley Scott.
0061906220|5.0|I did not buy this book on Amazon; my daughter brought it home from her school library. We are having a ball reading it and singing the songs that are part of the story.  It is a good book for Kindergarten/First Grade level.  Highly recommend it.  I see there are other books in the \\"series\\".  I will definitely buy some for my daughter!
B002RAREAK|5.0|If you're an Usher fan, you'll like this album. Plays some popular songs that made the radio and some that did not.
1451696191|5.0|I usually am not a big reader but when it came to this book I tore through it like a child does presents on Christmas morning! The character development was fantastic! I highly recommend reading this!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|well, you can't expect to read the first novel and not continue and finish the whole series.  What is a girl to do.........
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is soooooo...good if you are horse crazy then get this app why are you still here! do it!
0793518326|2.0|But really, the notes in the book are way too smal & I don't need glasses btw. The notes are teeny tiny!<br />&The book needs to be bigger.<br />as  it doesn't open up properly so how would I even put it on my piano stand?<br />The only option is to hold the book in one hand and play with the other. & That's silly because obviously pianists play with two hands!!<br /> Sorry but this is a definite return.<br />I am saddened as I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Beatles.<br /> Apparently there is another Score book to purchase, that's for the recommendation Amazon.<br /> Hopefully with notes that I can read from the piano bench!<br />God Bless John, Paul, George, and RIngo. MWAH
0374214913|4.0|Most avid readers are, I suspect, at least somewhat fond of that fictional subgenre in which the world of books is intricately incorporated into the storyline.  When this is done well, there is no greater reading pleasure to be found.  And there is something out there for every reading taste: literary fiction, mysteries, thrillers - and in the nonfiction field, true crime titles about book thieves, forgeries, and the like.<br /><br />Robin Sloan's debut novel, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, is a worthy addition to the genre - a novel at which booklovers will definitely want to take a look.<br /><br />Young Clay Jannon, the book's narrator, is a recently unemployed San Francisco web-designer who is not having any success finding a new job.  Clay, like so many of us, gets online with good intentions and specific goals in mind, but finds himself, hours later, wondering how he managed to waste so much time aimlessly browsing the web.  Most importantly, he remains unemployed - and has no new leads - at the end of each day of his \\"job search.\\"<br /><br />So, when he stumbles upon a \\"help wanted\\" sign in the window of a 24-hour bookstore, Clay is all over it.  After a quick job interview (that largely consists of climbing a tall ladder to the store's top shelves and acrobatically retrieving the specified volume) Clay is installed as the bookstore's overnight proprietor.  But, as Clay soon learns, this is no ordinary bookstore.<br /><br />First, he is lucky if he sees more than one customer during any given night.  Second, the only books actually for sale are kept on just a few shelves right at the front of the store.  Third, the several thousand books housed on the bookshelves that line the bulk of this tall, narrow bookstore are only there to be loaned, one-at-a-time, to specific customers (a rather strange lot) who exchange a previously borrowed book for a new one.<br /><br />Something is up.  And Clay wants to find out what it is.<br /><br />Soon, using his programming skills, intimacy with the Internet, and a select group of similarly skilled friends, Clay begins to unravel the mystery of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.  And, what a fun ride it is - especially if you love books, conspiracy theories, and unlikely quests.<br /><br />Interestingly, the world created here by Robin Sloan is one in which even the most adamant advocates of the printed book and those who ardently embrace the digital world of e-books do more than just co-exist. The story focuses on a \\"best of both worlds\\" scenario that results in the discovery of a basic, but beautiful, simple truth about life.<br /><br />Sloan's writing style lends itself to a relatively quick reading of this little book, and that's not at all a bad thing because most readers will be eager to solve the book's inherent mystery.  I should note, however, that one of the book's side-plots did, in my estimation, more to slow the story's momentum than to add anything useful, or all that interesting, to the story.  Most readers, though, will easily forgive this.ng skills, intimacy with the Internet, and a select group of similarly skilled friends, Clay begins to unravel the mystery of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the other 2 books, I finished this in just a few hours. I could not put it down. I wanted to skip to the end soooo badly, but waited it out. Some parts of this series have been almost cruel to read but I must say I was very satisfied with the ending.
B000L53D4O|5.0|I got this for my grandaughter who just started walking. I like that the toy can adjust.  She like it also.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is cute, has beautiful graphics and cute story lines.  But the cost to progress is too much.  I had to stop playing because I had to buy extra gems to do anything.  But if you are the type that plays these games and gets really into it, buying gems prob isn't a problem.<br />Otherwise it is a great looking game!<br />I love my little pony
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it an awesome game and I had a lot of fun with it and I wold love for many kids and adults to play it
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is a great Disney Princess tale.  Perfect for my Disney collection, and you can't beat the price anywhere either.
0316228532|5.0|Read in two days. Could not put down. Insightful about psychological neurosis of social relations in everyday life, the loss of communalism in the face of aggressive market centered individualism which has commodified everything and made it so we have no one to turn to, a dire condition that hurts vulnerable children the most.for those who are interested in personal life under late capitalist modernity.
B0029PRXMM|5.0|My employer still uses the 2003 Office Suite (they'll get with the times one of these days). Therefore, I scrambled to find the earlier edition. I was impressed with the VBA overview. I was immediately able to put what I learned to practice.
B0098TL4YU|5.0|What a great CD! The video was awesome too! Filmed right here in Memphis! Great talent in this town! Best CD I have purchased in a while!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is rated 5 stars because of everything. If you like fast-paced, fun, imaginary game, it's all yours! Sometimes, it runs a little slow sometimes, but that will never stop you. Just run, slide, and get coins! Try to break your record. This will hopefully, be helpfully, and short.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Bought this for my son-in-law and he loves it! Watched it three times over the five days he visited for the holidays.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This book was SO hysterical, I found myself recalling it and bursting into laughter at the most inappropriate times. The book opened my eyes to feminism (a totally misunderstood subject prior to Moran) and also helped me realize how \\"The Patriarchy\\" has long been \\"impolite\\" to me and gone unnoticed. I've discovered new things about being a woman and I highly  recommend this book to any woman not easily offended by generous cursing and blunt facts about life!
0316069434|4.0|I've always lumped Michael Connelly into that James Pattersonesque category of disappointing thrillers churned out by a machine. I'm glad I finally took a chance and read one of his novels. I know I'm entering the series waaay into the story but I had no problem getting into this story. I truly enjoy Harry as a protagonist and will look forward to reading more of Connelly's novels with him. I couldn't put this book down once I got to the last 150 pages or so which is definitely what you look for in this type of writing. Recommended.
B007THA4FI|3.0|a little disappointing...lots of characters that are easily confused...was hoping for more descriptive writing...she painted such vivid scenes in the Harry Potter books...

B004XNGKBS|5.0|Device: Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\"<br /><br />Today was my first day of using this app to take notes in class, and I can honestly say I will never go back to paper again. Handrite is very user-friendly and packed with features. Even with my jumbo, greasy, fish stick fingers, I felt as deft as Mozart on a piano whenever my pointer glided across the screen, leaving behind beautiful and somewhat legible scribbles in its wake.<br /><br />Handrite does not create notes, ladies and gentlemen. It creates masterpieces, bedazzling works of art. With the ability to change colors and stroke sizes, I felt like one of those girls with the Hello Kitty pencil cases packed to the whiskers with pens, markers, and highlighters of every shape and hue. I was once envious of those girls and their perfectly organized and color-coded notations, but I held the notion that wielding anything fancier than a basic black Bic ballpoint was the writing equivalent of wearing a dress. My notes were doomed for monochromatic banality.<br /><br />Until today. With Handrite Notes Notepad Pro, I was lavishing my notes with fluorescent flair that would've made the '90s blush. A pink heading? Why not? Purple bullet points? Of course, marvelous combo! And there was absolutely no embarrassment involved, because all of this was done within the confines of my own tablet!<br /><br />Or so I thought. Before long, I noticed the cute girl next to me coyly glancing over, obviously impressed by all 8.9\\" of my glorious finger banger. Her eyes seemed to scream, \\"I want you\\" with every fierce stroke I made. Was I now the inducer of envy? A smile crept onto my face as I realized that my time had finally come, a time to reign over the barbarians, the graphite-smudgers and ink-leakers, the paper-wasters and tree-destroyers! I was now a god, and Handrite was my Mjolnir!<br /><br />I also like the feature that displays guide lines when you're swiping away, because I'm too retarded to be able to write in a straight line. Five stars.
B005LB1MY6|4.0|Now sometimes, rock music can become a little stagnant & predicable, take Steve Harris's & The Darkness 2012 albums as a prime example<br />But with Justice you get a great Dance/Rock fusion, which defiantly brings a bit of freshness, to a sometimes jaded musical genre.<br />So what does sound like? To me (a rock music fan) I hear a bit of Air, circa their \\"10 000Hz Legend\\" album, 1980's sci-fi/action film soundtrack & a little bit of Brain May style guitar.<br />So if your bored with latest offering from Ozzy, but want something that's not too alien for your music tastes, you certainly could do a lot worse that Justice.<br /> Oh, the Dance/Prog Rock analogy doesn't really work, I don't recognise any Camel or King Crimson stylings in there, maybe on their next record.

B00A24CD40|1.0|I bought this series in Dec; finally, this week, I had the chance to open the package. I was so excited about getting to watch it. The reading on my television screen, upon inserting the first disk, was &#34;cannot be shown in your area.&#34; I was astounded that I couldn't watch it after all the build up.<br /><br />I no longer have the receipt and would like to know if there is anyway I can return it.  I don't recall Amazon as stating that it couldn't be seen in this country.<br /><br />Otherwise, I have always enjoyed using Amazon; I like to support the company where my daughter works. The series is Downton Abbey series 1-3.

B00AFCEIB0|4.0|At first Iooked at the interface and thought &#34;What the ___?&#34;  It doesn't resemble the normal Google interface.  Once you get used to searching by clicking on the &#34;Web&#34; button, you're set to do a search.  The other buttons are for its internal actions.  However, I found that, even when on a Web search, the app handled rather sluggishly.  I found plenty of hits, as you would expect from Google, but it didn't seem to always like my finger and I have had trouble getting into some sites.  Other than that, and once I got used to the interface, it is fine.

However, once you get used to the interface, it is easy to use and does all you would want it to do.  You can see all of your connections, send them messages, see your inbox for messages, see who has looked at you profile, edit your profile, etc.  Nice app.

0765325950|5.0|Ok, here's the deal; I'm not so much reviewing the book as I am the reviews.  \\"There's no e-book because the author/editor is greedy.\\"  Okay, well that's like saying you're not going to buy a book because there is no paperback version until the hardcover has had some time to generate revenue.  If you made a review based on the lack of an e-book you need to get over yourself.  I've been reading these books since 1999 and if every 2 years I have to spend more money to get the hardcover, well, I can deal with that because if I can't afford it I can wait a few months and get the paperback or the e-book.  Oh, and by the way, the hardcover cost 20 bucks on Amazon.  Clearly Harriet is greedy; look inside the dust jacket on the front cover: The price is $34.99, so you got a $15 discount off of the list price of the book.  Really, they are so greedy.

0743243153|4.0|Scott Peck, the author writes in an easy to read, easy to understand manner, writing of his life and that of many of his own patients. He begins with a section on Discipline; the next is on Love; then Growth and Religion; closing (how appropriately) with Grace. He does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another's spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It's so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn't involve courage or work, it does not love!).<br />In this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck's extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual's total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck's suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (I simply do not agree with this, any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The music on this DVD is outstanding and all of the singers were superb.  The reunion of the original cast and later casts was great.  The four JVJs singing together was amazing.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|In the late 70s and early 80s back when it was still called Japanimation ,  Star Blazers, and the spaceship Yamato variations were my introduction to what we now call anami. For the time this was very sophisticated animation. The artwork was superior to anything American cartoonist were doing and it had a depth to the plot that unseen in any Saturday afternoon cartoons. In short I was hooked.  I never got to see any of the series beginning to end. Then when DVDs first became available the only copy of spaceship Yamato I could get would not play on my DVD player. I was a little anxious when I ordered this DVD.<br /><br />Among the surprises, I had not expected this to be a live action movie. If I had read carefully and realized this was actors and not animation my  prejudices against live-action Japanese science fiction might have change my decision to purchase. At every level this was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The plot summary for Spaceship Battleship Yamato generally follows that of the original animation series. For the rest of you; an alien race has appeared in the space above Earth and is bombarding Earth with meteorite  bombs. The effect of this bombardment is that the surface of the earth has become a barren and poisonous. The dwindling Earth population has moved underground and is fighting a losing battle against the invaders. As the movie opens one of the few remaining space fleets available to earth defense is being systematically destroyed with only the admiral's flagship barely surviving.<br />Saito, brother to the commander of the recently sacrificed escorts, and former and future commander of an elite space fighter squadron unit discovers an alien artifact that provides Earth command specifications for engineering and weaponry beyond current Earth capabilities. What is more he survives radiation exposure that should have been immediately deadly. Earth command adds the alien engineering to its last and most powerful space battleship, the Yamato and gambles on the significance of Saito's survival. The new battleship is launched against the aliens and proceeds on a last-ditch, all in the name of hope trans-galactic adventure to save the otherwise defenseless Earth.<br /><br />As a longtime fan of science fiction I could not help but be charmed by several small but intelligent decisions made by the writers. One of the great hobbies of fan boys is to demolish the pseudo-physics that explains the various engineering feats necessary for space travel and space weapons. In this movie the answer to: what is it mean to go into \\"warp\\"? Is \\"I don't know, I think we are going to jump across a bunch of space\\" - good luck poking holes in that argument. Asked about the details on the new wave gun technology the technical answer is \\"I don't know it's alien\\". Eventually there will be elaborate mostly nonsensical explanations but there was something very right about these answers.<br /><br />On the cultural side there were a number of small things in the script that I think were meant for the Japanese audience. Shortly after losing their original ship's captain Yamato indicates that it is returning with 36 on board- 36 as in the 36 Ronin, a classic Japanese samurai story. The chief engineer of the Yamato is Tokugawa the name of a very powerful clan in Japan and the traditional founder of the first shogunate or United Japanese dynasty. I will leave it to others to point out some of the other names and references that would have been instantly identifiable by the Japanese viewers.<br /><br />I would suggest that this movie compares very favorably to the original Battle Star Galactica. Or as I continue to think of that program Rattletrap Galactica. In Yamato the alien race, the Gamilas (maybe a reference to the Japanese monster movie Gamera?) could out fly, shoot or think the tin can Cylons. Capt. Okita would have no problem staring down Capt. Adama and has more leadership ability than Capt. Kirk. As for Star Wars fans , if a spaceship chase inside of a deathstar is cool, how about a squadron level dog fight Underground?!<br /><br />As much as I was a fan of the original animations I am a fan of this movie. I'm surprised to admit this but this was a surprisingly fun 130 minutes.eship chase inside of a deathstar is cool, how about a squadron level dog fight Underground?!<br /><br />As much as I was a fan of the original animations I am a fan of this movie.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating since my grand kids love to play this game, it keeps them entertained.
B00634GHJA|1.0|First new app I added to my Kindle so learning curve may be a factor.  Having said that I am far from a teck novice.  So....after 3 hours of struggling to try and get this app to recognize and transfer the 400 + pictures I had in my Iphoto I finally had to give up and delete the app.  Obviously for me this was a very frustrating experience.  On a side note Amazon could not have been more customer friendly in refunding me the fee for this app.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Well done and the animation is great, there are a few elements I would have liked to see more of and I felt the movie could've actually been a bit longer but still, great movie.
B005XLN97M|2.0|I got it &#34;cheap&#34; right before Christmas, for $35.00.  I'm so glad we didn't have to pay full price.  It's lightweight and flimsy, so it falls over easily.  Also, the pieces don't snap together tight enough for it to be portable from room to room.
B005H29GSI|4.0|This game is a fun idea, and my 7 year old enjoys playing it. He likes building the shapes based on what card he draws. However, the \\"launcher\\" they give works less than half the time. It is just poorly designed.  The birds hardly ever hit the structure, no matter how we try it.  This leads to frustration and we eventually give up.  I would recommend it, knowing that it could be frustrating for some kids, but fun for others.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have to admit, if you have not been to the theater, this cd will only seem marginal as far as sound quality is concerned.  Having said that, if you HAVE been to the theater, this cd will evoke very powerful moments from the film.  I have it on my Kindle and keep it running - constantly!  I've pre-ordered the DVD.  I'll have these songs memorized by then!  I think it was very brave of all the actors (and especially the director) to have the singing in this movie so real, so raw.  But it has made me want all of the movies I see now to be so real-to-life.  Don't we want our actors to be more human?

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book only took me 4 hours to read. That alone says a lot. Great book alltheway
B007KZY1YY|3.0|After having read the first book in this trilogy, I was a little dissapointed in the second, Fifty Shades darker, but overall still enjoyed reading it. It's great that Christian Grey's character is further developed, but overall the book was a little vanilla, and reminded me of the more classic Mills & Boon style of fiction. Out of discipline, I will read Fifty Shades Freed, the third book in the series, hoping it will tie in all 3 books.

B00A4GXJD0|5.0|I am a long time SE Michigan Kid Rock fan. When I first heard the initial tracks that were available for this album (Let's Ride and Detroit, Michigan) I was a little concerned as I didn't like them that much. Once I had the whole album and listened to it end to end those songs fit in and I started liking them more. I still think that the song Detroit, Michigan is a bit forced but Robbie has always been a big Detroit supporter and this can be sort of an anthem song when he plays here again I guess. Love love love Chickens in the Pen, Catt Boogie, and Red Neck Paradise.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|My 6 year old son absolutely loved this book. I intended on reading it myself to see how the book differed from the movie but when I saw that the audio version was available I uploaded both to my Kindle and shared it with my son who is learning to read. It was hard to tear him away from it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are cheesy, some are easy,  and some are impossible!  But it's a fun time waster! Getting more points to buy more games is the real challenge!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I loved this book. Seeing the different entries and hearing from various characters is what makes the book so good!
0345803493|5.0|This was my favorite book of the trilogy! I could NOT put this down to save my life! Absolutely loved it!
B004J64QSI|5.0|The best musical ever! I love Les Miserables so much I listen to it all the time.  It gives me chills!

B004UID2LC|5.0|Works amazing in my kindle. I recommend this app to everybody. You can download all the videos you want. Super!!!!!!!!<br />..
0345803485|5.0|I loved this series! I had a very difficult time putting this book down, I just wanted to continue reading it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has it all, you use your brain, but the sound effects are so soothing! The difficulty level increases at a nice steady, so you don't feel overwhelmed.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I have 12mb up and down. The video was in and out of very poor quality and HD. Throughout most of the movie the video was choppy and in some places the audio was off.<br /><br />The movie it's self was entertaining, but at times it was hard to see what I was supposed to be looking at on screen. Glad I didn't see it in the theater.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This was a Christmas present for a friend & it arrived looking shiny & new & on time for Christmas.  I haven't heard anything further but this was a great value.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|bought this as a gift for my sister and she was very thrilled, some features can only be accessed with a computer
0316010669|5.0|Not only is this a great book and now one of my favorites, but it's condition and texture was fantastic!
B008OHV5QO|1.0|No artist throws more product out onto the market than Neil...lately most of it has been utter crap.<br /><br />Neil Young...the money making machine..squeezing his loyal fans for every last dime in their pockets.
1451629192|5.0|Absolutely amazing. It really makes you appreciate life and what you have. It's extremely moving. Easy read and you'll never want to put it down because you just want to see what happens. You truly fall in love with Jaycee and what a strong person she is.
0345803507|5.0|The book, in fact the series is entertaining and reads fast. I was ill during the period when I bought the books so<br />it helped pass the time. I recommend this reading for open-minded, adventureous gals out there.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I love Eastwoods acting even at his age. His costars are also very good.The storyline I would rate excellent. Great
0345803493|5.0|Fun reading, a progressive story of two people and their growth in their relationship. Definitely different but great reading for any red blooded, open-minded, progressive American gal. I recommend it.
B00000JGHS|5.0|Great Movie, It has a Good actress in it. You get to see All of Her, Demi Moore<br />  Sexy Looking Babe
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I thought this would be like my facebook on my pc.Nope...It gives you the latest time line but the rest if you try to look around freezes up on you.I gave up using it on my kindle.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|An interesting read if you are interested in life after death and &#34;proof&#34; of an afterlife.  Got the e-copy and it I love my iPad.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It is ok for keeping my 1 year old entertained for a few minutes but it gets boring very quickly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enjoy the variety and ease of the games and app.  Quick, easy and fun. Only wish games earned or loaded on other devices stay when resetting is required.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I got this for my dad's kindle. I love it so much I am going to order one for me. It is a beautiful happy color, the strap keeps the cover from flopping open on you and it stands very well and securely.The other one I have constantly flops open worrying me that I will hurt my kindle.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is the best app killer there is its easy to use and really works i even have this same app on my phone i would recommend it to anyone
B000002IQ9|5.0|Love Phil Collins.  Excellent CD.  I have been playing it everyday for two weeks. All favourite songs.  Great price.  Arrived on time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful I didn't want to put the book down. I read the entire series less than one whole week. Love it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I recieved the product in a timely fashison. The movie also worked to perfection. I really enjoyed the my CD.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|I find myself referring back to this book a few times a day.  Davis makes us think about what we are putting into our body.  Sometimes a little too scientific, but it gets dumbed down after the fact in a simplified easy to read way.  Gives great insight into todays epidemic.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|Dylan's singing on &#34;Soon After Midnight&#34; and &#34;The Lost Forgotten Years&#34; peels back the years. The breath, the phrasing, the inflection. All pure Dylan!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written about a book. I will keep it short.  Do yourself a favor and buy this book!
B004123CO4|2.0|This book is not very well written,  the author rambles about the topic.  Has a tendency to jump from one topic to another.  This is like listening to an old school teacher.  Lots of knowledge but spews out continuous info that you have to gather and put to pieces to understand.  You have to read the text at least twice to understand.  Not a comfortable read.
B00178JDCK|3.0|It is what it is. Does the job you need it to do and inexpensive to boot. I bought it for the space setting.
B003F5WOEC|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Have purchased more for family and friends. I am no longer a concert goer, but when they came to town, I went to go see them. I love every single song on this CD.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is it.  This is my favorite christmas movie.  I'm biased from the beginning.  It's a DVD of my favorite movie.  Of course, I love it.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|All three books in the series are great. Twists and turns very suspenseful. Great writer. Would recommend this series to anyone.
B008G12ERC|5.0|The 2nd Law CD by Muse - it was a gift and it came just in time which was very good.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Awesome game.  Silly and very addictive.  Tons of things to buy at the store.  I even spent my own money to get more coins for the store.  I recommend this game very much.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|Love, love, love it. I hope she writes more of their \\"school\\" books. She's just brilliant. I love everything Harry Potter.
B0039O8AQK|4.0|Wake up America . Its good for all to watch . It depicts the future with out rights . Illegal words . Illegal breeding .
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The product was shipped fast to my door and is still in good shape.  Lasting product.  Husband loved it! Thanks!
B00065JTBA|5.0|The definition of a fan in my opinion is not to have expectations towards what you are a fan of, but to have acceptance of anything they produce. That being said, fans that stick to this rule will always be happily thrilled with anything they buy. I know I am!!!!!! Anybody can enjoy this cd collection, however a TRUE fan will die without it.......I &#60;3 Bon Jovi!
B00007FOMP|5.0|Loved this album. You get a sense of Marvin's true soul & thoughts on life overall from his point of view on each track. Definetely a MUST-HAVE if you're deep like me! ;)
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I have always loved Phil Collins (probably because I fell in love with Tarzan!), and this cd have revved up my passion once again!!! I highly recommend this to any Phil Collins fan!
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love this movie...Downey Jr. gives a fantastic performance as Holmes. :-) Also, an interesting role for Jude Law...he plays it very well. This is totally one of my fave movies.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|disappointed that after a couple of weeks I had to download it again due to an unknown error.Found it clear and entertaining but when the snow arrived it dived under the covers and stayed there! giving it another chance and downloading again!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  She picked it out but I have not heard any complaints so i think she is very satisfied with it.
B007N8RULO|3.0|It's Spider, and it is on your phone, that is about it.  I like it less than the Windows version or the Card Shark version on my iPod Touch, but better than what I have on my Nook color.  Good for waiting rooms at the doctor's office, and that is about it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Incredible! Incredible! Incredible! This book is a must read. Suspense, romance, and drama wrapped into a really emotional story line. Can't wait to read Colleen Hoover's other books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I fist stared playing I have to say it was quite simple but as you go up levels it makes me think and I have a tendancy to play way longer that I inttended.  Great game!!!
B0087EVHTE|5.0|great value and speed. I would recomend over i7. Easy install but I did use a different cooler and haven't had any issues.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book kept me reading because I wanted to know where there relationship was going. I did not like the ending at all. It seemed like it stopped in the middle of the story. The physical parts just seemed a little drawn out and boring, compared to continuing the story.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have to use it more before I can rate it.I have to use it more before I can rate it.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I Robot. I have always liked this movie (Will Smith stars in it) I would recommend it to everybody and everybody. When I ordered it I was happy that it arrived within the time I was told I would receive it
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Seems hard to use.Seems hard to use.Seems hard to use.Seems hard to use.Bla, Bla Bla, Bla, Bla, Bla, Bla, Bla.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson does a good job completing the wheel of time.  It is not what RJ would have written, not completely, but Sanderson takes on the task of completing the WOT with obvious respect for RJ's masterpiece.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|I haven't received my Blue-Ray copy yet, but I don't need it to say what a great movie this is. If you haven't seen this movie, and like violent, crime/drama type movies, get a copy now! You won't be disappointed!
0062064304|5.0|I've been eye-ing on this book for a long time and purchasing this here was the right choice. Good price, great quality, packaging and it's exactly as it was described to be shipped. I'm very happy with this purchase<br />Packed with concept art and modelling, really good to get more details of the stuff involved in the film
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I just finished Season 3 on DVD and do not wish to spoil the experience for anyone by divulging any of the plot.  Needless to say the plot thickens both upstairs and downstairs with many twists and turns.  The acting is beyond superb as you would expect from past seasons.  I couldn't stop watching the dvd till I got completely thru all episodes - so engrossing.<br /><br />I'll be loaning this to everyone - there's a long line.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Happy ending<br />Less sex and more story, it is entertaining.<br />You want to know what is going to happen.<br />I liked the preview of how the story from MR Gray point of view.
B0094K1K42|1.0|I dont understand the uprise in dark dramas about mentally unstable people being billed as comedies. I like dark comedies, this wasn't one, I didn't laugh once, I only made it to the end because i was hypnotized by the train wreck
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Beautiful story!!  My sister-in-law is in the beginning stages of dementia and the movie helped my husband see and somewhat accept Helen's changes.  She lives in another state and he is unable to visit.  I thank Mr. Gosling for his insight and understanding and the actors for their tender protrayal.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had heard much of the hype before I read it, and while the sexual scenes are quite explicit and hot, the rest of the book was pretty boring. I was annoyed by the female character, she was wimpy and annoying and just not fun to read. Christian wasn't much better. I finished the book, but I have yet to have any desire to read the rest of the series.
0439023491|3.0|This was my least favorite of the series.  I liked Books 1 and 3.  I felt that this one started out a little slow, and it was hard for me to get into it.  However, I wouldn't have not read it, as it was necessary for the story line.  It was a very provocative series, and make me think about parallels in our society.
B004VM7M22|5.0|Great reading, held me spellbound and &#34;unputdownable&#34; . I really enjoyed Pillars of the Earth and &#34;Wings of Eagles.&#34; matched it.
0345536886|5.0|I just love John Grisham as an author.  I think I've read all his books.  My favorite was The Testament.
B008M721MS|1.0|If you do not have the lastest kindle fire HD with a camera on the front you will not be able to use this app
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was.<br />Just a fun escape for a few hours with laughs for me and blowing things up for the hubby.<br />I was not sure how it would be buying this on my Kindle but it was wonderful when the power went out and we sat there in the candle light, snuggling together watching this movie.<br />I would defiantly recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for a little escape from the day.
B00003CWN3|3.0|Hilary Swank won a much-deserved Oscar for her portrayal here of Teena Rae Brandon, a young woman living with gender dysphoria, who for the last years of her life lived as a man under the name of Brandon Teena before she was brutally murdered by two young men. The performance of Swank and other actors in this film is compelling. This film certainly humanizes the complex and widely misunderstood plight of woman and men like Teena Brandon who are forced to live not only with vilification and threats from many around them, but who must ever minute of every day confront the reality that their own bodies are a living mockery of how they conceptualize themselves and their place in the world. If art is a creative endeavor that enables someone to come closer to the inner world and experiences of another, than this is indeed one of the rarest things to come out of Hollywood -- a real piece of art.<br /><br />As evident from many of the reviews here, this film a has become an occasion for polemics and gender identity politics among some, for displays of misinformation and confusion among others, and for both by yet others. But one need not accept any of the usual claims about issues of gender identity and gender dysphoria to relate to the human tragedy behind Teena Brandon's life and death as depicted in \\"Boys Don't Cry.\\" Remember that the classic definition of tragedy is not merely the unfolding of a sad event; it is the inevitability of disappointment, defeat and ultimately death as innate parts of the human experience that none of us can avoid. From that point of view this film, and Teena Brandon's life, are tragedies we can all relate to.
B00AYL7OAY|5.0|Outstanding stuff from the \\"Tengos\\" and a great deal on the album from Amazon!!  A front runner for LP of the year already!  Don't miss it!
B00000JCOV|3.0|cd cover says  parental advisory- Explicit lyrics, but the cd says it is the clean version. What can be done to correct this problem? 1-18-13 I ordered a second copy but it was the same as the first.The producers and distributers need to be notified and they should be able to tell the difference between the clean version and the adult version, if not they should find a way,come on its not rocket science anyone can do it, just ask a few questions or just insist on specific labeling from now on.Thanks.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use This Wonderful App Every Night, It Helps Me Fall Right To Sleep! I'm So Glad I Downloaded It :)
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved it really good book it was amazing  read it it was heart felt and please read it thanks
B001EAWMGA|5.0|My husband and I both really like this movie as it is &#34;Sci-Fi&#34;.  Jim Caviezel is one of our favorite actors and we really like Sci-Fi/Fantasy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was definitely a surprise ending. It is the best book I have read in a long time hats off to Suzanne Collins
B004L35GAQ|1.0|They only have one good song on here, the rest sound like an awful boy band and I wasn't impressed by any means
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I had hope for this, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.  It says its for the iPhone, but the adjustable arm broke apart when I tried to put the iphone in the clip.  I am able to push it all back together, so that's good.<br /><br />The phone stays great in the landscape position, so I was happy that it was working as expected.  However, it does not stay steady when the phone is in the portrait position.  The phone is too heavy and the tripod tips over.  Maybe if we prop it against something we could use it in portrait mode.<br /><br />I won't return what I bought.  For the few dollars we paid, the kids will enjoy playing for it.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I love just about all the songs on here and they're all great hits. Highly recommend this CD to anyone that loves Shania.
B002VPE1XE|1.0|beware of the 1 yr warranty - if you return the item you will be charged a restocking fee even if Amazon does not have the item in stock to replace - this is a cheap (not quality constructed) chinease product that will &#34;let go of your equiptment!
0765325950|4.0|I'll keep this short, because there are already a ton of incredibly nuanced reviews here.  I'll try to keep spoilers non specific, but hell, you should avoid reading too many of these reviews if you don't want to bump into spoilers.<br /><br />Yes, the series ends how we all thought it would, but that's not something to be mad about, it's the sign of a well told story. The wheel of time series feels complete with this book, you can see the cycle of the ages pretty freaking clearly as it's explained throughout the books, and it's cemented in this one.  Dark one gets imprisoned, people dig him out, prison is resealed, dark one almost escapes, dark one is imprisoned, and in the process new heroes get added to the horn, the world is changed, and la la la.  Who cares if so and so's storyline isn't perfectly resolved, or whomever it was you liked died like a bitch, or these two characters had similar voices, etc.  You had plenty of time with those characters over the thousands of pages of this series.<br /><br />Yes, the book is action heavy, with a lot of iterations of clashing forces and desperate struggles.  Cool, that's my reward for reading the previous 13 books.  I want to see every possible character given the opportunity to not be a punk, to step up and do something, and that happens in this book.  Yeah, it's not totally elegant, but I mean, 3/4 of the book is a fight scene, and over x-hundred pages of battle scenes it's pretty impressive, everyone in the book gets to stab someone else.<br /><br />Lots of complaints here from people who wanted a longer denouement, but really, do we need to see shell-shocked and maimed soldiers returning home to mill over the death of what was apparently 90% of the population of the world? I like the characters that wrapped up this series, and we're left with a feeling that just because the main conflict of the series has been resolved, that this is still a thriving and vital universe, and the surviving characters that we love arestill out there interacting with the world and each other. Of course there are loose ends, but really every character in a story should not find closure at the end of a book, it hurts the world.  This world lives on, the characters still have things to do.<br /><br />So yeah, you could see this ending coming, but I'd prefer a good ending I can predict over some stupid Box of Orden BS anytime. We got a last battle, and it was huge, dramatic, and satisfying.
B008L40Q7E|3.0|I have been reading and enjoying the Bond series on my Kindle.  Happy to say the first five titles were pretty much error-free, but someone got sloppy at the end of Dr. No. In the last few chapters HTML mark up language appears where there should just be punctuation.  For example:  the name Pleydell-Smith appears as Pleydell&#X002D;Smith.  It would be nice if someone straightened out the text.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book brought back some painful memories of how it felt to be in an abusive marriage.  Sparks brought to pen some of my feelings and emotions from that time frame.  Such a touching story that gives hope for the future and what is truly important in life.  Loved the suspense, thrills and the unexpected ending.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My favorite thing about this clock is waking up to not only a varity of alarm sounds but my own cd songs if i choose.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very good story line. I couldn't stop reading it till I was finished. Could have dismissed some of the descriptions on the embracing scenes.  Kind of like you were directing a movie.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great, Wonderful!!  We really enjoyed it very much.  The movie was for our grandchild and we msaw it all together.  Thank you.<br />gliglu@live.com
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Loved the books, love the show too!!!<br /><br />Anyone that has not met Tyrion Lannister should buy this series now and acquaint yourself with this hilarious imp!!!
B005F3DFXG|1.0|This will not work in region 1. You must order the DVD version to watch in region 1. I had to return this.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Don't bother with the fifty shades trilogy unless your into reading trash.<br /><br />Boy meets girl, boy seduces girl, boy and girl fight, break up, fight, break up, get married, knocked up and live happily ever after. With lots of sex in between.<br /><br />It was like reading a fifteen year old girls diary (minus the red room of pain) ... would have been a lot better if the couple actually had a real, grown-up relationship.
B0083VP2KQ|4.0|BBC did it again with outstanding graphics and story. This is by far the best I've seen......BUT...... I can only view in in standard DVD format. BBC has not released it in the USA in blu-ray, only in Europe. I originally ordered the blu-ray that advertised for &#34;all regions&#34; to find that was not true and had to return it. I hope the BBC has plans to share this wonderful display of dinosaurs in blu-ray with the rest of the world.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|As usual Tom Clancy has done it again with Threat Vector. Good story, good charactures and before you know it you have read 500 pages and still don't want to put it down.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This ebay app is genious! I really liked everything it had to offer. I haven't found any glitches yet! definitely would recommend it.
1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink has written a great right brain left brain book. It's worth a look if you have any interest in how people function and why. Great for sales, teachers, administrators, managers and parents. I recommend.
0756688701|3.0|I thought it would have ALL of the characters since it is called an encyclopedia but it didn't. It showed various kinds of the same character but didn't show all the cars that my son has but doesn't know the names of them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|OMG!! It was AMAZING although I would rather her have married Gale.<br />I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! IT WAS VERY GOOD
1451688091|5.0|One of the first history books I have ever read that reads like a novel.  No wonder he was a great president.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book i cant wait for the next one and i hope there are more i will recommend this book to all my friends
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Funniest movie ever!!! Laughed all the way thru this movie... thought it would disappoint but taken by surprise. Can't wait for part 2.!
B004Y042N8|5.0|I only got this but I look forward to trying to solve more of the Puzzles.<br />I have only played a few levels but it was a lot of fun.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I think even though Season 4 is a lot different than the past that it is still enjoyable. The Break Up for sure is a must see episode!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game was really fun but it needs more to it to be worth the 2·99$ but the graphics are great and it is tons of fun!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Could not put this down, I have deep respect for Riordan's talents. What an excellent continuation of his books. Topped in my opinion only by the Kane Chronicles, which have been my absolute favorite so far.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fantastic for all ages.  Ninjas are all in right now and just is a wonderful game t have fun
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I watched the Alien series for the first time. Loved all the stories, I thought the best was Alien and Aliens.<br />Very good commentary and Bonus material. For movies made in 80's and 90's the reproduction is excellent, why it is better than some of movies made in 2K!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is my five year olds favorite one.  he loves playing it in fact he asked me to download it for him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun and addicting. I have been playing it a lot and can't seem to put the kindle down! There aren't any glitches as of yet.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I liked this one but wish there was a way to play on it without wifi.  You cant just take it and play which is frustrating to a five year old
0007447868|2.0|First 3 books kept me up way too late.  This book puts me to sleep.<br />What happened?  This book is mostly boring babble. No more gripping intense plot.<br /><br />The focus is no longer a well written story, with great character development along the way. There is character development galore, conversations that go on till your eyes will cross, all around mostly uninteresting characters & events, but with stories that don't move much, when they do, you just won't care. For example, I had meat-balls and spaghetti for dinner.  Do you want to hear the lengthy debate I had with my wife and a long list of the other dishes we considered, what we wore and all about our facial expressions leading to the climactic decision to have meat-balls and spaghetti?  Do you really care what I had for dinner?<br /><br />If the first 3 books had been like this, no one would have heard of game of thrones.<br />Seems Martin, like many other good fantasy authors, has run out of steam mid-series.  Time to end it.<br />Maybe it would be best if fantasy authors kept to a max of 4 books.
B0026772N8|5.0|This book tells the story of a few people riding their bikes across the West of the United States, but it is not really a book about travel. But then again it is. Travel toward the center of our own self. It is a complex book. To be read in sequence with Zen and the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel.The main point of the book is that happiness (or \\"quality\\") can be achieved by focussing on and finding beauty in whatever one is doing at any one moment while keeping a cool head on the way forward. Even listening to the unusual noise of a defective motorbike and looking for a fix can yield unexpected satisfaction. At the same time, fixing the broken bike requires scientific, rational knowledge, thinking.<br /><br />The challenge is to focus on the moment (zen) through a sort of meditative practice of detachment and at the same time never lose sight of where one is going, with (rational) planning for the future.<br /><br />\\"Quality\\" and \\"truth\\" were the same thing for the ancient Greeks, and perhaps they should be for us too. Here East Zen meets Western rationalism, the two are complementary.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a beautifully put together collector's set. I grew up with this movie and have loved it since I was very young. I ordered it just before Christmas not sure which family member I was going to give it to then ended up keeping it for myself and wishing I ordered several more sets on the day that this was the deal. It's a great find even at regular price though. Highly recommend it if you're a fan of The Sound of Music.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Needed a third controller for a friend. Did not want to spend half the price on a no name controller when I could get Sony quality for a few bucks more. Identical to the original controllers and it completes the set.
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|SOURCE:<br />This set represents a performance on the stage of the old Metropolitan Opera House broadcast on December 1, 1962.  This version is officially authorized by the Met.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />The sound quality of this CD is above average for vintage Metropolitan Opera recordings.  As noted in previous Amazon reviews, there are occasional roll-offs and too-well captured audience sounds, as well as a bit of over-enthusiastic stage noise, but all this is small stuff, failings of major significance only to those audiophiles who give more weight to mere sound reproduction than to quality of performance, poor limited souls that they are.  Overall, this set sounds very like what might have been expected from a very-near top-of-the-line radio receiver in 1962.<br /><br />The recording is described as \\"newly remastered\\"--cerca 2012--from the historic broadcast recording under the control of the Metropolitan Opera.  It is certainly an improvement on some old pirated versions I have heard, although the vastly knowledgeable Amazon reviewer Ralph Moore suggests that it is not appreciably better than other issues not known to me.<br /><br />CAST:<br />~ Ernani, a nobleman fallen on hard times and now gainfully employed as a bandit, in love with Elvira--Carlo Bergonzi.<br />~ Elvira, a noble young woman who is rather over-burdened with importunate suitors--Leontyne Price.<br />~ Don Carlo, King of Spain and soon to be Emperor Charles V, another of Elvira's suitors--Cornell MacNeil.<br />~ Don RuyGomez de Silva, Elvira's uncle, who also loves her, or at least he wants to marry her, a hard-line conspirator and revenge addict--Giorgio Tozzi<br />~ Giovanna, comprimaria, a denizen of Silva's household--Carlotta Ordassy.<br />~ Jago, comprimario, a denizen of Silva's household--Roald Reitan.<br />~ Don Riccardo, comprimario, another denizen of Silva's place--Robert Nagy.<br /><br />CONDUCTOR:<br />Thomas Schippers with the Metropolitan Orchestra and Chorus.<br /><br />TEXT:<br />I do not have a close knowledge of this opera, nor is a score readily at hand, but simply from the date of the performance, I would deduce that there are cuts.  Once again, I commend the review of the well-informed Mr. Moore for details.<br /><br />FORMAT:<br />Disc 1, Act I--37 minutes, 53 seconds.<br />Disc 2, Acts II, III and IV--67 minutes, 51 seconds.<br /><br />DOCUMENTATION;<br />Track list with timings that identifies characters singing in each track.  Brief summary of the plot by act. Photographs of Bergonzi, Price and MacNeil in costume and character.<br /><br />COMMENTARY:<br />As it happened, I listened to this very broadcast on that Saturday morning, just over fifty years ago.  I particularly remember the beloved, long-time announcer Milton Cross all-but apologizing to the radio audience for the Met's inexplicable decision to broadcast such a moldy old relic as Verdi's \\"Ernani.\\"  How things have changed!  And, frankly, I am just a bit disappointed that Cross' uncomfortable opening  commentary has been expunged from this issue.<br /><br />As has been noted by previous Amazon reviewers, the presence of four such singers as MacNeil, Bergonzi, Price and Tozzi on stage together is more than luxury casting by today's pallid standards.  Nevertheless, such groupings were common half a century ago, so commonplace, in point of fact, that they certainly did not generate particular comment from critics or audiences.<br /><br />Even amid such stellar company, the most impressive singing in this performance comes from baritone Cornell MacNeil (1922-2011), here at his vocal peak.  MacNeil made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1959 and closed out his career there with his 92nd Scarpia in 1987.  In hs prime, he was known for a ringing top and this recording documents some quite wonderful high notes from him.  I saw him a couple times with the San Francisco Opera.  He was an adequate, if hardly great actor, but from time to time he sang like an angel.<br /><br />Carlo Bergonzi (1924- ) was, with Corelli, Del Monaco and di Stefano, one of the quartet of Italian tenors who arose to international fame in the post-World War II era.  Corelli and Del Monaco specialized in power and excitement.  In his too-short heyday, di Stefano offered remarkable vocal beauty.  Bergonzi's particular specialties were technical precision and elegance.  Of the four, Bergonzi lasted longest.  He made his Italian debut as a baritone in 1948.  By 1951, he had retrained to make his tenorial debut as Andrea Chenier, hardly a lightweight role for even the strongest of tenors.  His Met debut was in 1956.  His formal retirement concert in America was at Carnegie Hall in1996, although in 2000 at the age of 75 he made a famous, if ill-fated attempt at Otello, a role he had never performed on stage.  It was a failure, but a noble one.  In this performance, Bergonzi is an elegant and committed Ernani, but that very elegance is a fault, for that chump, the crude, rude, idiotically honorable Ernani, is the very antithesis of elegance.  Even so, the fault is a minor one in view of the fine singing.<br /><br />Giorgio Tozzi (1923-2011) was an American bass of the first rank.  His Met debut came in 1953.  Whenever I saw him with the San Francisco Opera he was a rock-solid and impressive performer.  I particularly recall him thirty or forty feet above the stage in the War Memorial Opera House, floating  amid the clouds and cheerfully dissing the entire heavenly host during the prelude to Boito's \\"Mefistofele.\\"<br /><br />Leontyne Price (1927- ) first appeared at the Metropolitan in January 1961 in a memorable double debut with Franco Corelli.  By the time of this performance, not quite two years later, she was at or near the apex of her powers and had a solid position among the great operatic divas of the world.  Beyond question, she does some memorable singing in this \\"Ernani.\\"  However, I cannot offer a rational assessment of her performance here or elsewhere because I had the misfortune to see her twice with the  San Francisco Opera, at which times she offered the most ungracious, selfish and unprofessional performances I have ever seen in my life, thus souring me on her forever.<br /><br />Thomas Schippers (1930-1977) was not one of my favorite conductors but he was energetic and adventurous.  I think he did a perfectly sound, even light-footed job on this score.  The Metropolitan Orchestra and Chorus are fine, even if the latter overdoes bonhomie in the opening scene.<br /><br />This is an excellent representative performance of what the Metropolitan Opera was all about back in the 1960s.  Had I been there, I certainly would have cheered during the final curtain calls.  It does not quite match the quite extraordinary brilliance of the \\"Ernani\\" conducted by Mitropoulos with Mario Del Monaco (a man born to sing Ernani, if ever a man was!) and Anita Cerquetti from a few years earlier, but that performance, woe and alas, is available only in wretched sound.  There is also a studio version of \\"Ernani\\" with Bergonzi, Price and Schippers, but with somewhat lesser performers in the bass and baritone roles  That one is good, but lacking in the intensity and \\"ping\\" of this live performance.<br /><br />To any who can abide \\"historic\\" sound, this \\"Ernani,\\" while not the very greatest on record, is still worth a solid five stars.>Carlo Bergonzi (1924- ) was, with Corelli, Del Monaco and di Stefano, one of the quartet of Italian tenors who arose to international fame in the post-World War II era.

I have played this at least once a day since it arrived and I feel joy from the beauty of it.  I want more!  Can't wait for the next album.  The music is lovely and the choice of songs is so in line with their voices.  Very pure and clear.  I have a lot of other tenors' music and find that I prefer Jonathan to them.  He will be a major star.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best drama to hit the waves since MASH. I feel it's very well written and is just a compelling story line.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although the beliefs expressed in this book may seem far fetched to some, it cannot be denied that it was an experience that took place for the author.  The beliefs are an extension of a spiritual experience discussed in the Celestine series of books and falls in line with my beliefs that the energy he speaks of exists and can, indeed, communicate in some ways with those of us on earth.  It caused great happiness for me to have my own personal beliefs verified and substantiated by the author.  I highly recommend this book to those seeking a spiritual experience.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|Living in the moment is a concept that is derided by the populace in general.  For me personally the book helped me to more clearly understand the time I have wasted worrying about tomorrow and missing the meaning of today entirely.  The old saying that &#34;common sense is not common&#34; is clearly applicable to this book.  He clearly states that and made me aware that if I stay in the moment my anxiety will decrease and my contentment will increase.  A simple but worthwhile idea.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I started reading this book a couple of years ago and just couldn't &#34;get into&#34; it.  When it was on Kindle's Daily Deal, I thought I'd give it one more chance.  My advice to you: Don't get discouraged and stop reading the book.  After I got about one-third of the way through it, I couldn't put it down.  I just finished it, and I am SO happy I stuck with it this time. I highly recommend this book and will be buying the second in the Larsson trilogy.  &#34;The Girl&#34; is an amazing character, and her feats are astounding.  So happy to see &#34;The Girl...&#34; revisits us in Larsson's next two books.  Can't wait to read them.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Love this album!!!!  Several songs stand out... title song - Amaryllis as well as Miracle and I'll Follow You.<br />All in all, there's only a couple songs out of 12 that I even think about skipping when I play this CD.<br />:)
B002ZG97LK|5.0|This is the best movie ever.  I love watching this one, but not quite as much as the orignal.  It was packaged and shipped in a good speed and I have had no issues.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|This CD is great for getting you moving! Especially Sound of Madness and Devour.  Other good songs... Second Chance, The Crow & the Butterfly, and Call Me.  BUT...  Favorite song on this album is If You Only Knew.<br />Love Shinedown!<br />:)

B001EBV0OY|4.0|This was a great movie. It really made me think about our criminal justice system in America and all the innocent people that have been put behind bars. It's really too bad.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Loved the movie and all the music, unfortunately the cd is missing several key songs.  They should have made a two cd set and just charge a few dollars more.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This was a well done film. I really enjoyed the history of the movie. After watching it, I researched a lot of the names and more of the background of that time period. It's horrible what the gladiators had to endure.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I bought this album after watching Bruce and the E Street Band perform it (and more) live in concert.  I think the writing and music of this album is the best Springsteen has done since &#34;Born In the U.S.A.&#34;  It is Springsteen's Americana poetry at it's best.

B00979CS50|2.0|This is mostly extended guitar riffs (which is actually the best thing about the recording) with seemingly stream of consciousness &#34;drifting back&#34; by Neil, but the lyrics are almost painful to listen to.  If anyone without the name recognition of Neil Young recorded this it wouldn't be marketed at all.  My wife and I are longtime Neil Young fans, but this is hard to listen to.  The &#34;Americana&#34; album done by Young and Crazy Horse is much, much better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow what a book, I had been looking at this book for months, when it came out and I hear all the coments about hot racy it was I almost walked away. but after motnhs of hearing the reviews I had to buy the book.......<br />what a page turner. kept me on the edge of my seat all the time.....
B0085RQLXK|5.0|This is a great CD.  The songs on this CD they do in concerts so it is just a fantastic idea to get this.
B006LFRGE6|5.0|I have recommended this book to to several people, and they have all loved it. All the characters are rich, and the story draws you in.

There wouldn't be what we have today if not for this heart felt soul and heavenly sounds. Even If you disregard the religious inferences, one cannot help but feel good all over. The movie gives it more punch because of the visuals, but on a road trip, it makes the traveling sooo nice :-), and fun. This was  a gift for my mate, but I admit I love the movie also because of this music.
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|Trilogy is a great album that I would recommend for anyone who like R&B.  He is talented and Expect more albums that are as equal or better to this one.  3 albums for the price of one.  You can't beat that plus you can just hit play and let it ride.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I gave this show 5 stars because it is a great show. Funny, great comedic timing, excellent writing and fabulous actors. You'll fall in love with them.

B0023SDPS6|2.0|I was able to put the book down to read later.  It  was not an urgent page- turner to find out who done it.  But,  I did enjoy all the character developments, and the story location.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I have so far completed about 3/4 of the book and am not sure why I keep reading it - just that I hate to give up on a book and keep thinking it will improve. The main character is not very believable: vapid, but with flashes of supposed erudition which do not seem to fit. The plot is not very believable, either: is somewhat believable in its (conception), but not in its execution.  I have not read anything by this author before, heard an interview of the author on NPR, read the review on line and thought the book sounded promising. Not so much.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I bought this for my son for his birthday.  He was thrilled with it, and started watching them all that very same night.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I can honestly say this book has just made the list of my favorites books.  Just finished and know I will continue thinking about it for a long time.  Even though the subject matter is so overwhelmingly sad; I found myself unable to put it down. Found myself laughing at times and sobing at others. This book has stirred so many emotions that I cannot  put them into words. It simply beautiful. I love these characters.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I never thought I would appreciate a wireless headset as much as I do now. The fact that you don't have to worry about buying and replacing the batteries all the time and you can just charge it through USB is very convenient. I can easily get 10 straight hours of use out of a full charge. They are noise canceling as well which is an added bonus, although a lot of times I can't hear my wife calling for me...They are quite durable and the mic boom isn't flimsy.<br /><br />The only thing I have to complain about is when I wear my glasses. After a few hours of use the sides of my head right by my ear where my glasses sit tends to get sore. Not terrible pain by any stretch of the imagination, but you definitely need to take them off every so often for comfort.
B00AW0KGYI|3.0|For the first time ever, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 1 will be seen in an brand-new extended edition DVD and with eight additional minutes of never before seen footage that should and could had easily been on the first home video release. But no, Summit Entertainment/Lionsgate are making us spend more money of getting the film again to see deleted scenes added back into the film in honor of Breaking Dawn Part 2's DVD release.<br /><br />There's more footage somewhere out there that was included in the book and or that was created only for the film that was filmed. Unfortunately, they were deleted and laying in the vault of Summit Entertainment/Lionsgate, which some fans may care and the original 117-minute theatrical version is included on the new edition and you're only get the commentary with the UV/digital copy just like BD:P2's release and you'll lose the remaining extras which will be sadly disappointing.<br /><br />You may also want to keep your previous copy just only for the other extras instead of tossing it out and you'll feel really stupid for tossing your regular edition in the garbage that when you discover that all the other extras are gone, just get the extended edition and/or keep your original DVD copy and watch the deleted footage on YouTube because it's not a two-disc special edition DVD this time around!<br /><br />Update: 2/19/2013: If you finally want to get to see what the eight minutes of footage, you can go to movie-censorship.com and when you are there, you can type in Breaking Dawn- Part 1 and you will see what's in the eight minutes of never before seen footage and if you should or should get the blu-ray or DVD again for just eight minutes!<br /><br />Update: 3/2/2013: Not bad or good use of a extended edition even for eight stinking minutes! Me and my friend learned a very difficult lesson on the cash grab experience especially from Twilight. However, the added scenes gives the movie some kick into it even it's still disappointing and yet mediocre at neither best or worst. But make some points more clear than theatrical and you should see the extended edition because it's more explainable even it's unnecessary.worst.

B0077ZNCE2|3.0|I have never read the book, but all I got out of thise movie was that it was about a pregnancy. This shouldn't have even been a whole movie. Still the scenes where there was actually something happening, it was good.
B00782O7NE|3.0|\\"The Artist\\" is a mildly entertaining lightweight film, noteworthy mostly because of its \\"gimmick\\".  The gimmick is its format, which is patterned after movies in the \\"silent era\\" - black-and-white, screen aspect ratio of 1:33, and (almost) no sound.<br /><br />Plot-wise this movie is pretty darn bland.  George Valentin, a silent-movie star at the height of fame, crosses paths with a worshipful budding starlet just as the movie industry is about to embark on talkies.  Valentin rejects the new technology and a few short years later is a forgotten penniless alcoholic, while the starlet embraces the change and soon becomes famous. In other words, the plot is a mishmash of \\"A Star Is Born\\", \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", \\"Singing in the Rain\\", and a whole bunch of other movies. Tellingly, \\"The Artist\\" would have been a disaster if it had been filmed in modern movie format, but that would have been ridiculous since the story is not the point of this movie, which is primarily an homage to the early years of Hollywood and to a different style of moviemaking.<br /><br />As such, this movie was well done and a really interesting lesson in how a lack of sound changes the whole structure of a movie.  The actors' expressions and gestures, dramatic background music (and occasional dramatic LACK of background music), extensive scenes with only one actor and considerably less dialogue feigned in the others, and even sporadic lip-reading were only SOME of the tools that had to be assembled into a coherent tale, and in its own way this heightens the viewer's engagement with the movie.  Probably one of the reasons the dog from this movie became so popular is because dogs don't talk in the REAL world either, so he was easy to relate to.<br /><br />However, the other thing this movie provides is a variation on the theme \\"The Emperor Has No Clothes\\" - not the movie itself but in the acclaim it received from the Elite Intellectuals.  Because frankly this is NOT a great movie, or really all that particularly good.  But, you know, everyone is anxious to demonstrate that THEY are movie intellectuals, and no one wants to appear to be a rube, so...  I've seen reviews and comments that hail this movie as a tribute to a time when moviemaking was in its purist art form, when actors \\"REALLY knew how to act\\".  What rubbish.  Anyone who dismisses the many EXTRAORDINARY performances of the past 80 years as \\"inferior acting\\" only because you could actually HEAR the actors is at best a blithering idiot and at worst a pretentious snob.<br /><br />Academy Award Best Picture / Best Actor?  Sorry but this emperor has no clothes.  I'll pick \\"The Descendants\\" and George Clooney over this movie any day.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Seriously I had Hopeless downloaded for a couple weeks and didn't read it because I honestly didn't want to be let down. Here lately I have read so many great reviews about books and then when I read them I am disappointed. That was not the case with Hopeless. In fact I could almost kick myself for not reading this immediately. I was amazed. I finished this book this morning and let it sit with me all day before I could write this review. When I first finished this book I was in a shock and awe stage in my feelings and couldn't compose in words how I felt about this book. Now I better and ready to share my thoughts.<br />One of the main reasons I read is to feel something or experience things that an author illustrates for me. THIS book, Hopeless, is exactly why I read. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. I can't wait to read more by Colleen Hoover. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves YA/New Adult contemporary romances. In fact all day today I have been recommending this book, I can't seem to stop talking about it with my other friends that love to read! So if you haven't read this book, GO GET IT or DOWNLOAD IT and READ IT... It's worth it!

1452110581|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter as a last minute stocking gift.  If it had been her only Christmas present she would have been very happy!  She has a cat with a peeing problem, so it fit the bill.  She laughed until she cried.  She posted it on Facebook to share with all her friends, some of whom have the same kind of cat problem.  It was one of the best all time gifts I have ever given her.  I gave the book 5 stars because that's the kind of pleasure I witnessed as a gift giver!

B00A8SPNYW|4.0|it played and downloaded fine on my original kindle.<br />I like puzzle games and this one is cute - my kids should get a kick out of it. it does have an undo button without going back to the main menu - just push the scent line on the bottom back to full.... hard to explain but easy to do - try it!! I had no freezing problems or lag on my kindle - although the repeat animations got a little tiring after awhile.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I liked the movie so much I bought the soundtrack right away. I'm so glad I did. It's a great track and great movie. Simply amazing!

B000ZFTXNA|5.0|I love, love, love this charming book that reaches out and touches the bibliophile in me! Only one who has a life-long love affair with books will truly appreciate this story of the decades' long correspondence between Helene Hanff, a script reader/ writer living in New York, and Frank Doel, the manager of an antiquarian British bookshop, Marks & Co. The correspondence starts in the year 1949 and ends in 1968.<br /><br />These letters reveal two people who shared a similar sense of humor and a passion for old books. Ms. Hanff had a particular fondness for antiquarian books filled with wisdom - the works of John Donne, Samuel Pepys, Newman, Leigh Hunt, Walter Savage Landor, and many others. Despite making little money, Hanff develops such a fondness for the people running the bookshop that she sends them food parcels when she discovers England is being subjected to food rationing in the post-war period.<br /><br />My love for this story is not only because it is about a love of books, but also because it harkens back to a time when people actually took pains to correspond with each other (not that they had a choice), an art that is slowly dying out (I try my best to keep it alive by penning long letters to my parents who live on a different continent and who are blissfully oblivious to the wonders of e-mailing and social networking).<br /><br />84, Charing Cross Road resonates with me on so many levels, and is the perfect read on days when I'd like to just slow down and savor the pleasure of curling up with a light read. The movie adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Sir Anthony Hopkins is another delight that perfectly captures the essence of the book. Also recommended:<br />Q's Legacy
0553801473|5.0|What can I say about Book 5 of ASOIAF that hasn't already been written about obsessively, ad nauseum on blogs everywhere?  This book, for me, was a 'set-up' book that may allow Book 6 to really jump off.  I'm still waiting for a book that will live up to the incredible magic that was Book 3, but that's a pretty high bar to set.  But let's face it, if you've already read over 4,000 pages you're not going to stop at Book 5.  Buy it and escape to Essos across the narrow sea!

0393088774|4.0|Krugman is obviously a, &#34;I'm right, you're wrong,&#34; type of personality but I appreciate that.  He writes smoothly about quite vast, expansive topics.  I am a new junkie but by no means an economist and I found the book eminently readable.  Definitely recommend.

B00AYQNOU8|5.0|This film has amazing cinematography of different places and cultures from around the world.  There is no dialog, but the images tell the story.  The soundtrack includes music from the various places that are in the film.  I felt  both intrigued and transported to a place of inspiration and beauty.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written and interesting to view the situation from 2 different points of .view. It kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Really like Castle TV show, so it was fun putting the TV personalities in the book.  Overall liked the story line.
B00A6RVRXG|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />I don't know much of anything about Yo La Tengo.  This is the first time I have listened to one of their albums from start to finish.  I'm glad I did. Opening track \\"Ohm\\" has a swirling, drone-like effect that hypnotized and pulled me through an invisible door into a melodic, free-ranging, indie rock world of a band that knows that they're about and will follow their muse wherever it may lead, and it feels like anyone is welcome to come along.<br /><br />And then comes the plunky, mellow, hum-dee-dum warmth of \\"Is That Enough,\\" with its string arrangements, and old school pop chords. The song seems kind of ironically mellow, which is amusing and pleasant, but what makes the song awesome is the wall of fuzzed out hard rock electric guitar soloing going on softly in the background.  Hard rock softly in the background - this is the first thing I will remember about Yo La Tengo.<br /><br />I'll also remember the sense of story on this album and a kind of dreamy, cinematic quality that seemed to pull me along from one track to the next. I don't know what the album is about yet, and I couldn't really quote lyrics effectively yet, but I hear acoustic guitar work that resonates with reflection and feeling, and seems to explore outward, return inward, and move outward again in a new direction.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for anything pretty, and so the Nick Drakish, \\"I'll Be Around\\" is probably my favorite track on the album.  The problem with favorites on an accomplished album like this one though, is that they're like magnets in a bowl of paperclips - I try picking one out, and a cluster of other songs wants to come along too.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B000JMKTLO|4.0|After I finished Gone Girl, I was craving more Gillian Flynn so I decided to pick up Sharp Objects. It was another book that didnt disappoint and kept me reading at every possible moment I could steal.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Music is great but track 11 is not good enough to be at Rihanna's level.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: Packaging is not part of the jewel case but more of that paper pak recyclable material. It is great to be more sustainable; however, the CD takes up more space than it should.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So glad I purchased this book!!!  It was enthralling and kept me on the edge.  Couldn't wait to get back to reading when I had to put it down for awhile!!!  Awesome book!!

B0053YGYO4|4.0|PRO: Rihanna has the feature on &#34;Princess of China&#34; song<br />Also, the music video is really great and beautiful<br />CON: The music sounds the same. I like Coldplay but could live without their music.<br />I would recommend this product.

B0090EIILU|5.0|Sure it is funny at times, but the same Sacha Baron Cohen comedy exists in this movie as the other 2 movies. This one is not the worst, but it is the 1st or 2nd best of his 3 famed movies.  Glad to have bought this product and recommend this. (@eplusq)

I am trying my hardest to read the Bible in a year, but with the understanding that I wouldn't just read.  I would take this into my heart and try to insert what God's purpose for my life is.  I want to get to know my savior and Lord on a more personal level.

B00361CAEE|3.0|I am not sure whether it's my laptop having issues or Amazon Instant Video, but it has been a headache trying to watch videos lately. I don't require flash player, but the alert pops up constantly and, after a few attempts, the video player manages to work. The film was great. I give it 5 stars, but the video player I rate 3 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent story, about a post-apocalyptic North America, a cruel punishment that forces kid/teenagers to fight to the death until only one tribute SURVIVES…  can't wait to read the next book!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|The are really very nice quality. Great colors! Easy to remove from the backing and easy to reposition on the wall. I used them on a wall that wasn't completely smooth and they worked great. However, I certainly wouldn't recommend them on a sand-finished wall.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was intrigued by the film snippets and wanted to read the book before seeing the film.<br />The early life of Pi gave a great deal of depth to his interior life. Trying to stay alive and<br />live with a tiger is mind bending.<br />I can accept that Pi journeyed across the Pacific ocean (it's a novel, no?) for 277 days.<br />After all that was written, the secondary story given to the Japanese shipping investigators<br />strikes me as something to get them to stop questioning him. Or, the Truth is like Faith,<br />take it or leave it.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The author is very talented and writes in different voices ... I enjoyed the chapters on current and past eras more than the future.  Very interesting concept, and well executed.  I need to watch the movie and look forward to doing so.

B00A80SHFM|3.0|As a film, Les Miserables is a remarkable achievement.  It is well-crafted, beautifully acted, and immensely entertaining. Much has been said about the live, on-set recording of the musical numbers. This technique gives the performances immediacy and serves the film well.<br /><br />Absent the visuals, however, the singing has problems. This soundtrack CD is most definitely lacking. The singing sounds strained and overwrought by these untrained singers. The worst of the lot, Russell Crowe, amazingly holds his own (more so in the film, but also here on the CD) because the others are so mediocre. Even Hugh Jackman--with his gloriously beautiful tenor voice--comes across as amateurish in his big number \\"Bring Him Home.\\" Eddie Redmayne is much better in his numbers, but when he pairs with Amanda Seyfried in their duets, the result is almost grating. But then, along comes Samantha Barks and \\"On My Own.\\" The clouds part and the sun shines! This is the Les Miz performance you've been waiting to hear on this recording. I have no doubt that it is because Barks has sung the song in performance countless times, that she knows her character well from having performed it repeatedly, and that she may have just thought, \\"Hey, forget this movie nonsense, I'm going to sell this song as I know it must be sold.\\" Her performance is lovely and a revelation, something this album needed.<br /><br />I suppose that fans of the film will like this recording, and fans of the stage will not. It has its merits. After all, it is a true representation of the film. But I contend it is not a true representation of this lovely and moving score.

0061969664|3.0|Most Bernard Cornwell novels are interesting enough for passing the time, but I don't recall that I ever really cared about what happened to the hero.  They usually display repeated headstrong impulses of such stupidity that they just made me grind my teeth.  Sharpe, Uhtred and the rest of Cornwell's gang seem to be really unpleasant people that get themselves into situations that always get their friends killed.  The only people worse than the heros are the villians, who display a super human capacity for evil.  You kind of wish everyone including the hero would just die off by the end of the book.  I don't know how historically accurate these books are, I never found them interesting enough to follow up with a real history of the era.<br />Unlike Cornwell's novels, I always found the C.S. Forester, Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser novels interesting and well researched enough to want to delve deeper into the actual history of the period.  Why are all the good authors dead?

I've read in the other comments that some of the scenes were missing in this version.  My son has not complained that anything was missing and he is very detail-oriented, so I trust that he would have noticed.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have since watched the movie with him and have not noticed the missing scenes.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers were referring to--it's the same classic that I remember!

0307730697|5.0|Fearless follows the life of Adam Brown, a Navy SEAL operator who served on Team SIX -- the same team that was later sent to take out Osama bin Laden.  Rather that focusing heavily on military tactics and language, this book focuses on the man himself who overcame struggles with drug addictions in order to turn his life around and become an American hero.  This book was not written just for military members or military spouses; it is accessible and relatable to all.<br /><br />In high school, Adam Brown stood up for the underdogs and asked the wallflowers to dance.  He admired his older brother, loved his twin sister, and showed amazing respect for his parents; he never broke his promises to them, even at the expense of jokes from his friends.  His drug addiction after high school changed all of that, though, and greatly affected these relationships as well as the direction his life was heading.  He couldn't hold a job, would go missing for days, stole from friends and family, and later ended up in jail on 11 felony charges.  After his release from a Christian drug rehab, he met a girl named Kelley who became the support that he needed to combat this addiction and return to being an honorable man.<br /><br />My favorite part of reading this book was that I knew what Adam Brown would become -- I knew that Adam Brown would be successful in life and would eventually end up being ranked in the top 1% of Navy SEALs.  Even as I read through some of his darkest years and wondered how he could possibility get out of this trap, I knew that it would all work out so that he would marry, become a father, and serve our country.  I was in awe of how the military was able to give this man a second chance, and even more amazed that Kelley, his wife, had the necessary faith in God, in her decision to marry Adam, and in Adam himself to be the support he needed.<br /><br />This is easily one of my absolute favorite books.  I loved the emotions I felt as Adam graduated with honors fromhis military courses, worked with other Navy SEALs to accomplish unthinkable missions, counseled and taught his children, lost use of his dominant eye and dominant hand, saved women and children in firefights, praised and taught others about God, and loved his wife.  I would (and already have!) highly recommend this book.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I Would love  more games like this for android, that will PLAY!  Longer and more involved and not so much money
1609611543|5.0|I read this book soon after I received it. Very enlightening. Started eliminating wheat from my diet 3 days ago.  So far so good!  Amazing how many food products contain wheat, so you need to read labels carefully.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Great Price for being blue ray. Was a very nice Christmas present. Wish more box sets were this price. Blue rays are worth the money especially with action movies
B005UDD1R6|3.0|It plays music and a FEW videos, I don't know if my new HD is the problem with the video playback but every time I go to the aVia website to get the plug in for kindle it says the site is DOWN and that's been a week now. I use splash to play video and use aVia for pictures, but it won't animate gifs. It has limited functionality at least on my Fires. But for free I am getting an easy way to view folders and do pics and tunes. MP4's that play perfectly on my phone and laptop freeze or stutter. And I have given up trying, I've even re-coverted some movies, it won't play flv's either.
B00005JKGK|4.0|Based on the book of the same title written by Amy Tan, the story skillfully weaves together the story of four modern Chinese American women and their cultural inheirtance from their mothers.  The story is told through the eyes of June, the least dramatic of the four modern women, of their childhood into adulthood connected together by their mother's majong playing friendship.  We're taken back into early 1900's China to the mothers' lives and compeling experiences which greatly influence their hope for their daughters.  Keep a box of kleenex at hand especially for June's emotionally charged conclusion.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app because it helps me in with keeping all my info with me when I am the go.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|I love Nesbo's Harry Hole series.  They're thrillers pocked with the usual murders and mayhem you'd expect, but there's something fresh and different about these ones that keep me wanting more from Nesbo..
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Good song, relaxing, Amazon download service worked perfectly.  All said and done, I would reccommend this to anyone wanting to add to their library.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun game, but could use a user guide or tutorial.  It was a very large download but it  was worth it.  Game play is smooth and graphics are great.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is very fun.  addictive too.  I would reccommend this game to anyone wanting to add to their game collection.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I watched this first time when I was 7 or 8 years old, and now finally it was on bluray.  Not disappointing, the colors, the audio, the clarity,....all are very good.  Thank you.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This works good, found Wifi in rooms that had no sign posted and was able to connect.  I would reccommend this product.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Rock of Ages was awsome....... Deff not for kids alot of sex and rock and roll of course but the soundtrack alone would have been enough for me i loved it so much i just got the dvd yesterday and i have watched it 3 times already!!!!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great! Our kids even enjoy playing it from time to time. My husband is so addicted to it he always has time to beat his high score.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Recommend this for moms of unique kids. Recommend this for teens unique or not. Recommend this for teachers of junior high and up. Reminds you to live much more kindly.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Here is a CD that features an amazing amount of songs. There isn't a single one that I didn't enjoy. It's hard to find an artist with a CD that good.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Greatest ending ever and they are not afraid to kill big characters. No errors in the book and it has 800 pages definitely going to keep u occupied
B009U9S6FI|3.0|It was an interesting book and very informative of the sad trials and terrors that one man had to endure.  It was amazing that any one person could endure what was put on these poor souls.  I just wish that it would have gone on with more of his life after he was released.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|What a great asset to our collection of Beatle and George music, movies, books and memorabilia.  He was our favorite Beatle and wish he was still with us.<br /><br />The collection arrived in time for Christmas as promised and my husband is thrilled.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really look forward to getting this on my Kindle Fire.  The imagination some people use is so interesting.  I'm an artist and enjoy doing a quick sketch of a subject.  My onlyi complaint is that the subjects suggested for drawing come around too often.  Please get more subjects .  I don't want to have to buy them.
B0086DBE62|5.0|Great movie if you really like the snow white cinderella fairy tales. Great twists and turns and who knew Julia Roberts could be so evil! he he he

B009JBZH54|5.0|I was wary of getting this because it seemed too cheap for 3 blu-ray movies, but it's perfect! Even the box is good quality, and the video and extras are sharp. Perfect product.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|This movie like all of the other Twilight series was a great movie with lots of action and met our expectations!

B0038P59A0|3.0|We love the Sherlock Holmes movie series and have not been disappointed by any of them at this point. Great movie!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Really started out wonderful. The end of the second season was almost like watching porn.  I was enjoying the actual talent of the actors until I started fast forwarding.  I have a life, I do not need porn,,,,,,,,
0765325950|4.0|Like many, I've been reading the Wheel of Time for half my life (started reading in the summer of 1992) and it's a bit of a bittersweet feeling to reach the end. I devoured this book over the past week, reading whenever I could, because I really wanted to know how it would end, yet it's also sad, in a way, to reach the end and to know there will be nothing further with characters I've grown to know so well over the years.<br /><br />I believe very strongly in not posting spoilers in a review, especially for a book as widely-anticipated as this one. If you want spoilers, there are plenty of reviews containing them (indeed I refused to look at any reviews here until I was finished reading). My top overall thought about this book, however, is that reading it was borderline exhausting at times. Many people have complained, justifiably, about how the series' pace slowed to a crawl for a while several books ago. This book is the antithesis of that. When I'm reading, I like to keep going until I hit a logical stopping point, preferably the end of a chapter if feasible. In the case of this book, it was often hard to find a good stopping point. Back in January 1994 I stayed up all night one night reading \\"The Shadow Rising\\" (Book Four). I was 20 years old then and I'm approaching 40 now and staying up all night isn't something I can manage these days, especially not to read a book, but if I ever wanted to try to do that again, this is the book that made me feel that way. I don't think it's a spoiler to say this book involves near-constant fighting and battles and it never lets up. I finished the book last night at 6:00 PM sharp and this morning I still feel a little bit overwhelmed by all that happened.<br /><br />My second thought is that Sanderson (and Jordan, through his notes) tied up most of the storylines far better than I expected. As recently as \\"Knife of Dreams\\" I found myself wondering how in the world he (Jordan was still alive then) could ever pull everything back together. For the most part, though, they've done it. There are some aspects of this series, and three parts of the world, I'd still like to have seen explored more thoroughly. Setting that aside, though, I felt a bit rewarded several times when I saw some plot lines that had been left hanging since the very first book finally being revisited and tied up. I can't say that after all these years I necessarily remember all the details from the first book. I didn't have time to re-read the series before starting this book and I had to content myself with the substitute of giving myself a quick refresher from synopses on the Internet. In that sense, I kind of envy someone who's starting the series now after all the books have been published. No four-plus year waits to find out what will happen.<br /><br />All in all, I feel this was a worthy conclusion to a monumental series. I give it four stars rather than five only because I feel like the ending left a few things a bit too wide-open. Of course I also understand that from an \\"in-universe\\" standpoint the ending is completely logical and that it happened exactly the way Robert Jordan intended because he has often stated that he wrote the ending way back at the beginning. I keep telling myself that the way this story ended was not THE ending, as there are no endings with the Wheel of Time. But it was AN ending.<br /><br />Finally, I want to make a comment on the Kindle controversy: I own a Kindle, had it for two years now, and I love it. This is the first hardcover book I've purchased since I had the Kindle. For me it would not have mattered if the Kindle edition had been released on the same day. I would have bought the hardcover because I own the other thirteen volumes, plus the prequel and the Big White Book, in paper format (the first five novels in paperback, all the rest in hardback once I caught up with the publishing schedule). I wanted to complete the set. I wouldn't have bought the Kindle edition because I can't justify the expense of buying the book twice. But I also understand the eagerness for the Kindle version many people feel. Let's face it, a 909-page hardback doesn't lend itself to portability or to easy reading on the subway or when you're sitting on the toilet. With that said, however, I don't think one-star reviews are an appropriate way to address the issue and I think Amazon ought to delete all that nonsense. The purpose of the review is to rate the BOOK and to tell other people whether the BOOK is worth reading. Giving a one-star \\"review\\" that says nothing at all about the book itself and instead chastises the publisher for not releasing the e-book promptly tells readers absolutely nothing about the book itself. Put differently, the vast majority of the \\"review-bombing\\" whiners have not read the book itself and therefore cannot be considered to have anything worthwhile to say. The appropriate way to voice your complaints is to send lots of letters to the publisher, not to rant about it on Amazon.<br /><br />PS. Giving negative ratings to reviewers who disagree with the \\"review-bombing\\" nonsense is also not the proper way to voice your dissatisfaction.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I can not believe the price I paid for this set !!!!!!!!  It is truly worth a fortune to any one who enjoys MUSIC, not noise.  I DO recomend this MUSIC to any one!!!!
B00A757EFW|2.0|I used to love Pac-Man. I bought this version for my Kindle Fire. The problem is that you have to use your finger or a stylus to play the game and the game does not respond well to either. A dissappointment.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is thee best app that I've found that I actually like. Love all the choices of sounds &amp; timer.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'd never heard of this until recently but I got this DVD for my wife for Christmas and she loved it.  We watched it together and now she's got us watching the current TV show too.  Good program and interesting plots.
B007SGM084|4.0|So far what I have read is just as they say it was. Awesome... I would recommend it to everyone I know.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my wife who has to watch this every time it is on the TV.  I have to admit that I like the movie too and it is a great movie for us to watch together!
B004RE29PO|5.0|Just watched the Blu-Ray of Aliens on my 55\\" flatscreen last night and it looked absolutely incredible.<br /><br />I first saw Aliens when I was six (scared the pants off of me), but have watched it so many times I've lost count.  Every edition I've had simply gets better and better.<br /><br />Started off with a VHS copy that was taped off of the Movie Channel in '86.  My friends and I watched that copy until the actual cassette wore out.  Then, bought a legitimate copy on VHS in '96 or '97, (which looked awesome compared to the taped copy.)<br /><br />Next, the highly anticipated DVD version was released in the Quadrilogy in 2003, which, at the time, was breathtakingly crisp compared to the VHS.  There were details that weren't even visible on the VHS that were being seen for the first time, and the color was so much better.<br /><br />Now that the Blu-Ray is out, I simply don't think it can get any better.  It's vivid, sharp, and beautifully remastered.  James Cameron went through and removed a lot of the grain, but not enough to where it starts to look overdone.  The picture and sound are stunning, and the color is near perfect.  I couldn't be more pleased!  Definitely the definitive version of Aliens and is what was meant to be seen.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Playing the title role made famous in Silence of the Lambs, Hopkins in the best vilian every.  Ed Norton almost steals the show as an FBI agent who fills in a great deal of the story before the story.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|Immediately added ads to the notification bar. I had no more interest in the app after that. I thought this was a free paid app via aafaotd!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't wait for the Third Season DVDs.  This is the best series in too long.  I re-watch Seasons 1 and 2 and they are fresh and new every time.  There are gaps in the story where cuts or condensations have been made.  Please provide the full script, even if it means increasing the price as the gaps in the story (both seasons) detract from the enjoyment of the series.
B005VPRF9I|3.0|There wasn't much here -- packaging was deceptive, making it look likje there was more.  My grandson enjoys it, but I feel I paid more than it was worth.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|This app makes me wish I knew more math, because I'm convinced that's what would really unlock its power. Instead, I'm limited to asking it the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow over and over again.<br /><br />Still, every now and then I want to know a location's population, etc, and it beats scouring Wikipedia on my phone.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|If you're like me, the first thing you thought of when you heard they were making a new Judge Dredd movie was probably that awful 90s version starring Sylvester Stallone, and this most likely kept you from shelling out some hard-earned credits to watch it in the theater. I so regret not having watched Dredd in a theater. This isn't just a good Dredd movie or just a good comic book movie, this is a good movie PERIOD. There are some ultra-violent, ultra-gory scenes during which you might want to look away, but the rest-from the production design to the soundtrack- will stick with you and leave you wanting more.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Great for getting to a wordless mental state. And when you play and learn how to manipulate the effects of your fingers working together and in opposition, you feel like you're touching something deeper. I'm sure it's because I'm weird, but the first time I figured out how to simulate the Big Bang it sent chills through my body.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|We love watching these at Christmas time.  Brings back the spirit of when the kids were little and we watched it all the time with them.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I discovered this series of books from watching the shows on HBO.  I have read all of the books and am currently half way through this one.  I have to ration my reading to 3 chapters each night to make it last.  Don't have anything bad to say about it.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My girlfriends and I are addicted. We all own it and sing the songs constantly. We're having a Pitch Perfect movie night every month now. Love love love this movie.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Full of details. Very well plotted. I enjoyed it all the way to the very end. It kept me reading. I was interested!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am really enjoying this coin dozed game. it reminds me of summer time and going to the carnivals or to the boardwalk and playing it.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Been looking door something like this for months now.  Love being able to share traffic info on the fly.  A must have for commuters.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. Very well written, as well as a great storyline. It showed a love story that had its conflicts, like all relationships do. I would definitely recommend it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read so many reviews before I bought this book and I was looking for some of the areas people said were rather weird or should have been modified (like Kel's age), and a few other things.<br /><br />I have to say, I don't know where those comments came from. Kel's 9 year old self, acted exactly like a young boy his age would. He was playful and immature, but extremely sarcastic and perceptive when the moment called. This story really touched me. The author really covered the characters well -- even I want a purple Hair Clip. I laughed out loud while I was on the bus... cried on my couch at home, gasped when the moment called for it... the works. Finished this in a day...<br /><br />I read A LOT... at least 3-4 books per week... and I absolutely loved this book. The poetry slams taught me so much about modifying my approach to life... doing the right thing while still living in the moment... a mother's advice when it counted the most... the words were all so telling and significant.<br /><br />Layken and Will share an all-consuming love for each other that the author very cleverly paints for us... along with all the real life aches and pains that push those kinds of relationships apart, back together, apart, and finally together again... never guaranteeing a happily ever after. Genius. I've already bought book two and I'm more than confident that it will be just as  amazing... if not more incredible than this one. My face was full of tears at the end..<br /><br />Colleen Hoover, you are talented. I loved HOPELESS. I'm going to read ALL of your titles. EVERYONE, please read HOPELESS after you're done with this series. You're life will never be the same!!<br /><br />If you're thinking of reading this, please just buy it and read it!! What are you waiting for??
B008WCP2PG|2.0|NOT WORTH THE EXPENSE. NOT MUCH OF A STORY. HARD TO FOLLOW. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.<br />VERY DOLL.
B0026772N8|2.0|This is a very detailed book and may be perfect for that person who is into minute details however I was unable to get involved in any way.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Series....hysterical quips by all cast members...especially Maggie Smith.  We got hooked after watching series one on Netflicks.  Thank you
B005K0HDGE|5.0|great book.  I was addicted and didn't want to put it down from the moment I started reading it. Best book I've read lately
B005XLN97M|5.0|I ordered a week before Christmas. And was worried that it wouldn't like it in time. But it came on the Sat. before Christmas and I was so happy. It was very easy to put to together. My little girl was so happy when she saw it and she plays with it everyday.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing!! I could not put it down and i could not wait to read more when i did have too!!!  I cannot wait to start book 2! I give this 5 stars because from page one to the last page was interesting and intense and could not wait to read what happens next! Not all books can do that.
0316182060|5.0|This is just a most delightful romp in the realm of manga/steampunk/victorian imagination!  Carriger's books are such fun....it is a treat to get to revisit them in this form.  Brava!
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|The camera works fine, but that isn't why I bought this app. Can't use the video because it crashes and closes every single time. Gotta say I'm pretty annoyed by that.<br /><br />Btw, the kindle he does have a camera for photo taking. Go to your photos and in the top right corner click the camera symbol and tadah!<br /><br />But please fix the video!
B00913P6G0|5.0|I usually don't give the &#34;instant classic&#34; vote to many new artist. I believe this is a great album with a great concept. Its not just a collection of songs.
B000000XB9|5.0|This Cd was exactly what I wanted. My friend and I love it.. Its so cool when you get a CD that has ALL good songs on it & none to skip. Thanks
B0002EXFNI|5.0|Emotions run both sides in this movie.  It was received in a very short amount of time.  great item and price.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I like it. It's a good way to mindlessly pass the time instead of being productive. When I want to be worthless for a bit, I'll play this game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Interesting story line, great graphics and puzzles that are not too hard or too easy. What more do you want? I don't understand all the complaining about having to pay to finish the game. There is nothing deceptive here. It's right in the game description for all to read before downloading. Do people actually expect developers to give away games of this quality ??? I prefer this method since you get to try before you buy. This way if the app is buggy and doesn't play well on your device, you're not out any money. This is the way I'm going to buy my games from now on.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really like romance novels. This one was pretty tame, but I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed every moment.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked the hunger games books, they reminded me of a mix of \\"the long walk\\" and \\"the running man,\\" two Stephen King short stories. However, I think because of the violence they are just not suitable for the intended target of teenagers.<br /><br />The main character is kind of droll, and there is very little character building or reason to like her, I believe. However the concept of the books and story line is what makes them page turners.<br /><br />This book, the final in the series, I felt leaves you wanting more. It feels like the author quickly wrote this in an effort to get it published, leaving the reader to fill in the holes.<br /><br />All in all I'd say its decent in its conception, but not something I'd want to read again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book of the series truly met every expectation.  A good read.  The characters grow and develop in good way despite the situation.  I liked the storyline.  I would have liked more closure.  I wanted more, but satisfied.
0810996596|5.0|I really like it. It's amazing all the stuff kirk collected all these years. I'm also a figure collector so I feel identified with most of the items shown in the book. Thanks.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|I love this book! It is one of my all time favorites! I love all of the rivalries between Mr. Twit and Mrs.Twit! The muggleswupps make me giddy!
B009MF5BXK|3.0|I choose this rating because it was just okay.  The movie had too many actors and Jet Li (I don't want to spoil it but...) he was just in it for a minute.  But I liked the 1st Expendables better than 2.<br />Its not bad, Its not good, just okay...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun mindless game. Once you level up a bit you will stay busy for a while.  Save prizes don't sell.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|4 + can have app not under 4 years is not 11 stars me please I like app yoppypohkp i

B003B02O14|4.0|the book is very good, i enjoyed reading it. It is one you can not put down. I was hoping for a different ending.
0786955570|5.0|This game is great and can be played by yourself or with several friends.  It does require a pretty large surface to play on since all the maps are random.  This game is team based, meaning that everyone works together to accomplish the goal of each adventure.  The game comes with over 10 different adventure each with its own distinctive element.  Great fun each game is never the same.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So good  tears laughing  Couldn't put it down. Happy and sad. But such a great friendship  the love u can share as kids.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game.lots of fun to play.fast pace.easy to play on the go.easy to play anywhere.<br />harder to play 2 suits makes a good challenge.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|There isn't much to say about this game that hasn't already been said. It was recommended to me on Amazon so I read some reviews. I was very intrigued to say the least. I also had very high expectations when I put the disc in this morning. But after 5 minutes I knew this game was special. After about an hour I balled all the way through the rest of the game. The depth of emotion this game provokes is exquisite. I started working with another half-way through who had a bunch of designs on their cloak, and they obviously knew what they were doing. This made the experience even more emotional. This game deserves a play from anyone who wants to experience a beautiful story, with beautiful graphics, a staggeringly emotional soundtrack, and intuitive game play. Soooo good. So very, very good.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this apps is no good ! I better go on web[...] and enjoy.I tried it but does not work for I want. I want to enjoy Hiindi old hits songs but this apps does not offer that.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|I did not like it - felt it too easy for the Kindle Fire to drop out of it and purchased another that works well.
0765325950|5.0|After rereading the prior books in the series I was excited to get the hard back and dive in.  I was not disappointed, from the start there was alot of action and it continued till the end. Where the bad reviews come from is a mystery to me.
B001BZRUR4|3.0|Great Characters but this is no Book Thief, while very enjoyable compared to the Book Thief a disappointment. I will keep reading him though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|No words right now. Just tears. I never thought I could love/hate a book at the same time as much as I did this one.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|I played this game on &#34;another device that I'm not allowed to name or my review is rejected&#34; when it first came out and it worked great and I loved it. I received a kindle fire for Christmas and decided to play it once more. The game crashes at least twice a chapter and causes me to have ro replay a bit of the game. That alone didn't deter me, but after getting to the clock tower the clock won't open! I can't continue any further. I know I'm doing it correctly, because I have the game on my &#34;undisclosed brand of smartphone&#34;. Apparently others have had the same problem since the first. This is an unacceptable glitch to have for this long a time.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it!!!!! I love how you get new blades &amp;new background!!!!! I love how you get to cut the fruit.
B006H5120E|5.0|I was a little skeptical about them pulling off the 3d conversion on this file. I did not go and see it in the theater when it was re released in 3d format. I have a home theater with a optima hd33 projecting onto 18 foot wide screen, and was blown away by how realistic the 3d was, it was up there with both Avatar, and Hugo. As well as current movies such as Avengers and Prometheus(as far as 3d quality).<br /><br />It was a real experience for me as i have not seen Titanic in awhile. So it was almost like watching it for the first time. The digital conversion was right up there withe the best. If i had not known better, i would have thought it was filmed entirely in digital to start with. The sound quality was just as impressive as the video quality. If you have the right set up, this in 3d is worth the buy!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love a story that isn't entirely predictable. Being an avid reader for over thirty years you start running into the same story lines, author's rhythms become cliche'. Refreshing to find not just a new author but a new kind of author.<br />Harshly descriptive and insightful. This story winds up slow and steady, then gains speed quickly jumping the tracks. Swiftly down the dark, spiral staircase of the mentally ill and the broken.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book! Have felt this same need  to know what lies beyond our physical and mental being after death. The feeling that we can be loved as well before and after our passing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't stop reading it along with the other hunger games books! The series is amazing and the  suspense makes me want to keep reading!
0385535147|5.0|I don't read a lot of books but I really enjoyed this book! It was a good story and a quick read. I have read several of John Grishams books and have enjoyed his work.
B000002OVJ|5.0|They should have been on the original LP: all the songs on this version of Live At Leeds!! The Who released 2 double LPs around the same time! Why not 3??
0817439390|4.0|Great book!! the way it explains things arround and in a way that is easy to understand is very imprexive.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This movie was a wonderful surprise for me and several of my friends.  It deals with death and the treatment of the bereaved and the deceased in a way I've never seen before.  Highly recommended.
B008518MOW|5.0|We really enjoyed watching Men in Black 3 as a family.  Gave us many loaughs and was interesting to boot!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie is not just for the older set but certainly does it justice.  Beautifully shot and well acted.  Lovely setting.
0451418441|5.0|Love the way Follett smoothly blends his story with well-researched facts.  His books are &#34;keepers&#34;.  &#34;World Without End&#34; is another homerun.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app works seamlessly with my kindle fire, nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. I would categorize this as a must have app, but it could definitely use upgrades.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|GREAT story.  I agree that it is hard to put into words, the spiritual experience, but Alexander is very intent on trying to prove the existence of life after death so his journey gets a little muddled with clinical language.  However he comes through with a very convincing argument.  I recommend it.  It could change a skeptics mind.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This is the worst version of solitude I have ever come across. The method of playing is quite bizarre and I would not recommend it to anyone.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This is a good program.  It does have some problems in one of the several programs. I downloaded a version, and somehow it disappeared like magic!?  But I downloaded the second time, and it was different, slow to operate.  Of course, my machine could have been the problem....stupid technology...(LOL)  and knot to mention the new operator.<br />I have been playing chess for 40 years, and I sometimes play in tournaments, so I can say, it is a good game.  It can win at only the second level, and it responds quickly.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Gave it to my best friend for his birthday, as he is a huge Black Veil Brides fan. It arrived quickly and he told me he hasn't stopped listening to it since it came in.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very wonderfully written! The constant back and forth pull if emotions was just what this story needed! Great characters and a killer plot!!
B000E5L89S|5.0|I was a bit concerned not receiving my long-awaited CD but when I did, was I thrilled at the awesome bound book/cd I purchased. My expectations were far exceeded!  thank you soo much, I love my new tunes by David Gilmour

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book it just amazing! I've seen the movie but the movie is not quite the same. I could just read it over and over and over again! Just outstanding. I love it.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The author, Doris Goodwin, certainly did her research.I expected to learn a lot about Lincoln. I didn't expect to learn as much about those surrounding Lincoln. Team of Rivals is though and a great learning experience.
0316023744|5.0|I recommend Antony Beevor's books to all who want to read of the many great battles and wars of the 20th century.  His two momentous tomes on the battle for Stalingrad and the fall of Berlin are truly great works of modern history.<br /><br />However, both Stalingrad and Berlin cover comparatively small portions of the Second World War.  Beevor's \\"The Second World War\\" strives to fill this gap.  And fill this gap it certainly does.  This is a great work of popular history that is written in Beevor's fast moving style.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable read.<br /><br />The book is largely chronological in it order.  It covers all the great events of the tragic conflict that was World War II.  Yet, at the same time, it also presents numerous vignettes that bring the war down to the personal level.  My favourite in this respect was the story of Yang Kyoungjong who we meet at the start and end of the book.  This rather extraordinary Korean was first drafted into the Japanese Army in Manchuria before being captured by the Red Army and sent to a labour camp.  He is subsequently also drafted into the Red Army during the depths of the Russian war in 1942 before being captured by the Germans and pressed into the Wehrmacht in attempt to boost numbers after D Day.  He is eventually captured by the British before moving to peace time America and dying there in 1992.  Amazingly, he never mentioned his past!<br /><br />Antony Beevor's research is meticulous.  The book is a pleasure to read.  It comes with my highest recommendation.

B009IVXU9A|4.0|A bit intimidating and you need space to put it together.  We still haven't gotten very far!  But my daughter loves all the characters and horses.
B000V63BN6|5.0|A great collection of Steve's masterful work. The best Stevie collection that I could find. However, several key songs were missing for me that I purchased one-off from other albums: Ribbon in the Sky, Knocks Me off My Feet, Isn't She Lovely, and These Three Words.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|The game was a good pasttime for travelling until I discovered that you have to pay for tips?  Come on!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Bruce Willis has simply gotten more fun and bad-ass over the years. An entertaining movie to watch again and again. There are also some awesome lines in this movie. A great edition to anyone's movie collection.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I feel as if I got a great deal on this product and shipping was very quick (2 days).  I could not wait to watch this on my plasma TV with my kids.  The video played through with no errors, the quality on my TV was amazing.  The sound, I feel could be better, but this I would blame on my TV (I am looking to add a surround sound system to upgrade the entertainment experience for when we get a chance to experience a movie to wind down).<br /> I do not want to play spoiler for this movie if you have not seen it, but I will say that there are a few super-heroes: Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Nick Fury and The Hulk.  Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) was great, I like that she had the look and nailed the moves.  Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner) was pretty good, there were a few really cool parts in this movie that Hawkeye had.  Captain America (played by Chris Evans) Captain is the first Avenger and even if the Captain is overmatched he will not back down and does what he must.  I really liked the humanistic approach of Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America as being more believable in the story because they cannot fly, do not have hulkish strength or able to command thunder.  They brought a sense of reality to the story.<br /> Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) was downright AWESOME!  I think Downey is meant to be Iron Man.  He captivated this role; his personality and character are very convincing for this role.  Iron Man is criticized as not being a team player but then.... happens (again do not want to play spoiler).  Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) was pretty cool; I personally think The Avengers could have had more Thor due to who the villain was.  Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) was very cool, as Jackson is cool in what seems to be every other movie in existence do to the amount of movies he is in!  Fury does what has to be done to assemble the Avengers to defend earth.  Lastly, my favorite character was the Hulk (playedby Mark Ruffalo).  I feel as if Marvel finally got what the audience wants out of the &#34;real Hulk&#34;.  Not to blame Edward Norton, I personally think that he played an aspect of who the Hulk really should be (during last hulk movie) when not angry better.  But unfortunately, it took Marvel up to this point with the Computer Graphics Imaging to get what we really care about down.  In my opinion, the Hulk had the coolest and most awesome moments in the movie!  I cannot wait for another Hulk movie!<br /> I do have some points to criticize about this movie- The fact that there are seven Marvel characters (hero’s) used and only one is female is a little underrepresented by females.  Also, Fury is a Marvel character but does little real fighting or real action, I feel as if the African American hero population is also underrepresented.  In the next film it would be nice to have another female hero and an African American hero.  The end result is entertainment and appeal.  I feel that a super hero should not just appeal to little boys, but little girls too.  I have two little girls and I personally think there is nothing wrong with them wanting to be like a hero that they have seen (goals, great virtues, etc...).<br /><br />Picture quality-5/5<br />Sound quality-3.5/5 *(see above)<br />Story-line- 4.5/5<br />Cast-5/5<br />Super heroes on team-5/5 *(although from my readings the Hulk is not a typical Avenger)<br />Value-5/5 $25 free shipping for Blue-Ray 3D, Blue-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy and Digital Music copy for a newly released movie.<br />Anxiety for Avengers 2-5/5!  lol<br />Hope I helped; this movie is now among my top five favorites of all-time now!  What are you doing reading?  Go out and get your copy today!  Do it now!
0765325950|1.0|It is heartbreaking to wait this long and then asked to wait another long three months before the ebook is released!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|G5 has released yet another winner! Well worth the download- akin to the classic 7th Guest... highly recommended to fans of puzzle challenges.
B004EPZ034|5.0|It was better than expected and the kid I got it for loves it. I told him Santa came early!
0399213015|3.0|I bought this as a gift and it's no exaggeration, it's tiny.  It still is the classic Eric Carle story and illustrations, but if you're giving it to someone, I suggest buying the full-sized edition.
B006K2WXOI|3.0|The book is ok.  I purchased it as a Kindle book after having purchased the hard-back version several years ago.  I expected that the images would be full screen and vivid, but I just didn't get that from this product.  It was like there were pages copied onto the Kindle with significant room to spare around the edges.  It's still the same story that we love, but I had expected more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it... she has a great way of connecting you to the characters i found myself crying and laughing out loud
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It played well for a while, but then it started causing my Kindle to freeze and it didn't work correctly.  I uninstalled it rather than risk damage.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I believe it's been said here before, but this may well be the best show they ever played.  Why, you ask?  The boys are getting old and, believe it or not, it takes a lot of stamina to rock hard.  If you check out the press conference you get the picture.  This show was difficult for them to pull off.  Why is the show so good then?  Because they DID pull it off. Because this is the last show Zep will ever play and they knew it.  They knew they had to rock it and knock it out of the park, and, from the looks of it, it looks like they had a freaking BLAST doing it. Listen, I saw Zep back in the day (Day on the Green), but they didn't have the sophistication and maturity they showed here.  Worried that Jason Bonham can't carry his dads' beats?  Jason is incredible and I'm not sure they could have nailed the show with anyone else.  He completely holds the groove.<br /><br />I cried tears of joy several times watching this and I can't stop thinking about it.  I actually agree with the comments about too much editing, but this concert movie scores a 7 in my book and even with a star off for editing it's a 6 star review.  This may go down as one of the greatest rock concert movies ever made.  Although I still love Talking Heads - [[ASIN:B002FE5XVK Stop Making Sense [Blu-ray]]], I don't think it had the lasting effect that this concert has had on me.  It feels like that feeling you get after you go see a really good concert and you just want to tell everybody about it.  This movie is incredible and I hope everyone who loves music will get a chance to see it.  There is not and will never be anything like Zep and this movie is proof.  I am watching on Blu-ray 50\\" screen at 6' with 5.1 surround.  You'll think you are there and stand up to clap between numbers.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|My 11 year old son has a hard time reading, so when he finished reading Charlie and the Chocolate factory for a class assignment and asked for this one, I was thrilled!  I was even more thrilled to learn that he read the whole thing in two days and his sister who loves to read wasn't even this quick to finish it.  Any book that grabs his attention this much must be wonderful!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The animals are cute but I wish there was a way to earn peanuts. Other than that the game's pretty good.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellant read, riviting . Hard to put down. I got to the end so fast I could not believe I had read the thing so quick.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I'm not sure why, but my kids love this movie and have watched it a gazillion times since Christmas.  They have a good chunk of the dialog and music memorized.  I'm sure the constant repetition of the movie and my children's re-enactment of the movie isn't helping.  But honestly, I don't care for children's movies that are nothing more than propaganda.  Had I read the book first, I would have expected that though.
B00AVNQ3YS|4.0|Like many, I have been listening to Manowar since their inception.  This CD is far better in my opinion then all of that tedious awful narration on Gods of War! The Lord of Steel represents a return to form. For all those still aching for Kings of Metal... well I am aching for Sign of the Hammer! Reality is that life goes on.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hate zombie stuff and anything scary.  In fact, I usually scream at least once through each episode.  However, the storyline is interesting enough that I'm willing to watch it still.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I downloaded this book because of the rating that you gave it.  I haven't been able to finish it because I have been so bored.  Slow moving, and looks as if it will have a predictable ending.  However, I will plod though it, between other books, hoping that the ending makes it worthwhile.
B0030DHPGQ|3.0|I liked this book but I had trouble putting it into practice.  I think I'll have to go back to try reading it again.  Getting Things Done helped me a lot more.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|David Fincher can do no wrong in my book.  Although I had never had a chance to watch this film, I knew it was special from the moment I put in the first disc and saw the wonderful design.  I haven't had time to explore all the features, but the film itself is incredibly well done and has so many subtle moments I'm sure I'll find something new each time I watch it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a pretty addicting book, much like slammed and point of retreat were. However I didn't realize that the content would be so disturbing. I figured out the ending too fast and when I did I almost stopped reading because its not what I was looking for in a book. I think coleen is a phenomenal writer and even though I wasn't a fan of the subject matter I couldn't put the book down. I hope she writes again soon. And I hope its not about something as dark as incestuous child rape.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|I can't believe I'm admitting that on a public site using my real name.  The girl is the real thing though and one of the few of the new generation who's making good music and not over-produced to the point where you can't tell how much is really her and how much is slick production.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|...and I've read thousands of books. Life doesn't end here, it never ends. I am a scientist I have a PhD in molecular genetics, and scientists have to BELIEVE that life ends with death. How do they explain near death experiences? As a last desperate firing of electrical signals of an oxygen deprived brain! Science has to wake up to the truth and the truth is in Anita's book. There is a life after death, we are spiritual rather than physical beings and there is someone who loves us and the whole world deeply. How deprived a life most scientists have to live, adhering to their self-imposed faith system of atheism. There is more to be had, more to explore and more to believe, and most importantly more to love in this world than you can ever dream of.
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you aren't watching Walking Dead, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?????  Go watch NOW!  The B&W episodes are being aired as a marathon for Valentine's Day.  Nothing says &#34;love&#34; like the zombie apocalypse.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The movies are good and the packaging for the movies is great I like how it was all put together.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|How can i review something that only lets me play trial for like 10-15 minutes? I didn't have time to do anything but killed by animals.
0756405890|2.0|I bought this book based on the many positive reviews it got, and I really wanted to like it. It starts well enough, but there are two reasons why this book fails to captivate the reader.<br /><br />The first reason is that the book has no plot. None whatsoever. Some guy (Kvothe), who thinks he is the greatest dude to ever walk the earth, tells the story of his life. The problem is that random events do not make a plot. I can tell you what happened (no spoilers): First he lived with his parents, then he lived on the streets of a city, then he went to the University. Wow, his life is almost as boring as my own. The book tells almost hundred tiny episodes (chapters are between 1 and 10 pages) of things that happen during those three spans. The chapters could be entitled \\"Kvothe learns playing the lute\\", \\"Kvothe gets beaten up\\", \\"Kvothe enlists at the University\\", \\"Kvothe plays the lute at a bar\\", or \\"Kvothe gives witty replies to a bully\\". The last happens often and it is quite obvious that the author got bullied in school and wrote down the witty replies that always came to his mind an hour too late (don't we all know this? Sorry, Mr. Rothfuss, I can sympathize, but it's just not very interesting to read). The tiny chapters have no overarching plot and the author is well aware of this and copy-pasted them around. In doing so, he made some mistakes, so that for example Kvothe gets addressed with a University title that he doesn't receive until later. There are also evildoers, however, they have no evil plan, they just appear out of nowhere (twice in the entire book) and disappear into nowhere again. We learn that they appear if you sing songs about them, so I'd recommend to just stop singing those songs: Problem solved, we can skip the sequels.<br /><br />The second reason that this books fails miserably, is that everyone except the main character does not get any attention. I don't have high expectations regarding characters in a fantasy book, however, in this regard\\"The Name of the Wind\\" is the low point of any book I have ever read, and I mean that literally. Everyone except the main character (whose red hair color is mentioned quite often) has a name and nothing more. You get no description of how they look like, they don't have any character traits, they all talk the same modern-day English, including vocabulary such as \\"sexual innuendo\\". They are not shallow, they simply don't exist. I would ask all those who gave this book 5 stars to tell me one difference between Wil and Sim. These are (supposedly) the two best friends of Kvothe, however the only difference between them is the difference between 'W' and 'S', and 'l' and 'm', and this is true for every other character in the book (admittedly there are some more letters in their names).<br /><br />These are the two most important problems with the book, however there are many additional flaws. One is, that the characters always act as the author needs it (or Kvothe, to be precise, because everyone else does not act at all). One term he cheats his admission with no problem, the other term he can't cheat, because cheating could get him expelled. However, he has no problem doing another thing that could get him expelled in the same week. The book is full of examples like this.<br /><br />Then the author tries to convey his worldview, and ruins parts of the story for doing so. There is a thinly veiled version of Christianity in this fantasy world, including a god who incarnated through a virgin mother, and the reader is supposed to be excited about finding out in the later books if this story, or the inofficial story is actually true. However as the priests of the official story have an inquisition and torture the heretics and (for those who didn't get it, wink, wink) are all pedophiles, it is quite obvious what the great revelation will be. Sorry, Mr. Rothfuss, anti-Catholic fantasy books are a dime a dozen, and others have done it much better than you (e.g. Pullman).<br /><br />I have actually finished this book, and have read worse drivel, which is why it gets two stars, but I can not recommend it to anyone.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I have always loved P.D. James' Adam Dalgleish mysteries.  When I saw this, I was intrigued, so I re-read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and then dove right in.  The story picks up where Austen's leaves off and then veers into a murder mystery involving familiar characters.  The mystery took some interesting twists and kept me guessing, but I wished the characters were more developed.  Perhaps this is because they are really Austen's characters.  It is worth reading and I am glad I did.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|When I first heard about the Walking Dead, I thought it was another anime in a sea of animes when a friend said it was on Netflix. Then I watched episode one season one and realized it was a live action show (of course i researched and know there is a comic book and a video game). I watched it but wasn't hooked yet. I was mildly interested. Then about two weeks later I watched episode 2, then 3, then 4, then 5. All in a row. By the end of the week I had finished season 2 and I couldn't stop. And I'm a guy who doesn't watch tv. I don't have any favorite tv shows until having this show grow on me. I think it was the psychology involved, like what if something like this happens, will we be able to kill our loved ones. Or I thought, what if one of those little kids turns into a zombie, how hard is it going to be to kill it? Of course thats what the show did and now more or less I'm numbed down as if I'm telling the tv, kill her or him before they turn even if they've been on the show for a while. I've currently found a way and have watched the first 8 episodes of season 3 and am impatiently waiting to see how Andrea and the Governor will work out. How Andrea will act now she realizes it was her friends that attacked their camp not knowing she was there. And how Meryl and Darryl will work things out. Arrrggghhh, I can't wait till episode 9 comes out on February 10th! This show has got me turned! lol
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Although I found the ending a bit melodramatic, the enjoyed making the journey with Harold.  I always looked forward to getting back to the story.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The show is amazing - one of the best tv shows ever! I am not sure who likes it more - me or my husband. This set is a great deal and has all the episodes for seasons 1 and 2 plus Christmas special plus extras about the house and cast!

B000AM1TGC|5.0|Why is this record not so well known? This is one of my all time favorites. Mr. Hackett should have stayed on a bit longer with Genesis but who am I to say?
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|A faithful adaptation of the Frank Miller graphic novel which captures the thrilling confrontation between Batman and the Joker brilliantly!
B000086EOE|4.0|Mr. Hackett surprised me with the arrangements of these songs. fun and different The guitar solo on Firth of Fifth is one of the best ever recorded.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this book. I can't wait to start the next and final book the series. I loved the first two book so I hope I like the next.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|After so much hype, we were disappointed to find this movie flat and sometimes disjointed, as if it's trying too hard in parts that did not support the whole of the movie. It just doesn't have the feel of the Spielberg touch.
140132634X|5.0|This book offers the reader some very insightful meanings about life and also helps the reader to look at their life with a different perspective. Very thought provoking!
0761171703|5.0|Amazing phototgraphs of dancers in action.  Some of the photos are really awesome, even mindboggling.  Joyful and fun to look at.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A great game to play when I have a few minutes to waste or on a car ride or plane-there are very few games I love enough to write good reviews for but this is one.

B0000640VO|5.0|I love love love this movie! I can't wait to watch it with my boyfriend next time i see him!!
B004J00KJ8|4.0|The movie is wonderful, but I found it overpriced.<br />If I had not been in a rush this could have been purchased for less elsewhere.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Extremely addicting game, you can get sucked into it for hours. I love playing it, especially when I'm bored. Highly recommended.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I like the book, though they could cut down on the blood and guts.  I wouldn't recommend it to kids younger than 10. Good, powerful story. DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE A SQUEAMISH PERSON, OR IF YOU DO NOT LIKE GORY BOOKS!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Really do not like this book. Recommend you find another to spend you money on. Asking for a refund now.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie since it's been a while since I've had my kids. I got this movie to watch on a airplane. It was very funny. I like the daddy support group. I was laughing out loud at the end of the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The first few episodes have been a bit &#34;tepid&#34; but based on the excellent 1st and 2nd seasons and the great potential set up by those seasons and the great characters, I, with hope, grant it 4 stars.  The reality has yet to be determined!
0618477977|1.0|It's not the gift set that I hate................. I never received my purchase.  My kids grew up with this gift set and my daughter who is now 26, lost the bell that came with the set.  She had her first child this year and I decided to purchase a new set for her to carry on the tradition with my grandson.  I ordered the gift set, paid extra for expedited shipping, Christmas came and went and the package never arrived.  The company investigated this and found that the item had never been delivered, was returned to the shipper and was ruined.  I did receive a refund but the company did not have any other gift sets to replace the ruined item.  It wasn't so much the purchase as it was the memories and the tradition.  Just very disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Never judge a book by it's cover - well I have always done so, looking for very used books figuring they were well-read.  Christmas came with a Kindle (which I love!!!) so ratings not used covers were my guide.  Don't judge this one by the title - just take it on faith and the ratings that this one, if it was on a library shelf would have to be replaced many times!  A new voice, I have just discovered this author and hope Ms. Hoover writes many more!
