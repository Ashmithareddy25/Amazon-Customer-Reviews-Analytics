B00009UW0N|3.0|The landmark horror classic that lauched the slasher movie & introduced Jamie Lee Curtis is a terrifying scene to scene creeper, a nightmarish classic, a thrill ride to strike terror in those who watch it, see John Carpenter's \\"HALLOWEEN\\"
B000002U9Y|4.0|I finally got this on cd after all these years. Not the most popular Pink Floyd album, but I always Liked it a lot. <br />People always say that it is uneven and a mish mosh, well a bit, but most of the songs are good so who really cares. \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\" is my favorite Floyd song of all time. I like the 60's sound and effects collages that has always been a big part of their sound. There are a couple of weak songs here, that people focus on, but if you focus on the good songs this is a good addition to any Pink Floyd collection. A Saucerful of Secrets starts out with a very cool bass line. \\"Let There Be More Light\\" is a spacey, cosmic song with very unique vocals and a great groove the whole way through. \\"Remember A Day\\"  more slow and a little repetative, but very original. The masterpiece of the album, however, in my opinion, is \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\", which is a song from the center of your mind. 'Over the mountain, watching the watcher' it goes, 'waking the darkness, breaking the grapevine - moment of birth is born into shadow... love is the darkness that ripens the wine'. It is some of Roger Waters' best song writing of his entire career. \\"Corporal Clegg\\" is a clever and intelligent look at war which features a strange kazoo part. Next, we have the title track, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\", which is a twelve-minute instrumental of strange sounds and clashing of china and cymbals, with wild keyboard and piano action, and a very strange slide guitar solo- all with Nick Mason's solid drumming in the background. Roger Waters was once quoted saying that it was supposed to demonstrate the before, middle, and end of a battle. The album ends with a full choir pushing to the end, this is a true classic. The album cover is really cool too!
0553382179|5.0|I've read all of the organization books.  This one you'll stick with and yes, it is life changing.  Can you believe starting with just your sink can make such a difference?  It does.  Just get the book.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book!  It's one that I read several times and learned something new each time I read it.  I'll pass it on to friends and family to share.
B000001ESP|5.0|Do you have that one cd that you will always consider to be your all time favorite?  The one where you can play from start to finish and each track takes you on a journey or to another place?  For me it will always be this release.  I feel that the overall sound on this album is probably why it has treanscended for so many years.  As I have gotten older I find myself appreciating production and the mix of an album more so than in my younger days.  On a really great system, these songs will go right through you.  Check out Neil Peart's drum sound on this album...so tight and clean and not exactly replicated again on any other release.  I would next have to say that LIMELIGHT for me, is probably THE quintessential Rush song.  Opinions are sure to vary, but one can't deny the impact that this album has had musically, commercially and historically.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I just can't stop listening to \\"Spirit on the Water\\" and to the remake of \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\"! I am 54 and I grew up listening to Dylan from the very first begining, but now this really is a redescovery! He has just turned on to the way I am feeling today.
B000L43AN4|1.0|Ever since Tom went into the barn to make his music, he's been painful to listen to. I understand his need to pursue improvisational meanderings, using anything available to bang on, but I miss the old Tom. I guess he thinks of it as progress, but to my pedestrian ears, it just hurts. I want him to go back into the Heart of Saturday Night.
0307341542|5.0|This book was with me long after I finished it. It left me wondering how the characters would fare beyond the end of the story. Did Camille recover and become successful?  Will we ever know?  Great book, first or otherwise.
B000I5X81A|4.0|I have been following Eric Clapton since the early Cream in the mid sixties. I have discovered JJ Cale in the late sixties. Folk, blues and rock and roll are part of my background. I would expect this album to surprise me. It didn't! Though it really is very good music, very good sound... Great, but what's next? It doesn't really matter, as long as it is really good music!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie was entertaining and satisfying.  The plot held my interest, and the ending was a surprise twist which, in contrast to some of the more cynical reviewers, I loved.  I rented this movie the first time I saw it, and have now purchased it, as it is definitely one to watch again.  In addition, it was also nice to see a movie that I could recommend to my parents without having to warn them about language they would find offensive.  It is a compelling love story, a nice combination of humor and drama - and let's face it, it's a work of fiction, so don't get all scientific about could this really happen - just enjoy the story.
0061015725|5.0|\\"Prey\\" by Michael Crichton is a riveting story of survival for the characters. It also sheds light into the world of nanotechnology, which is unfamilar to much of the public and how it's qualities are becoming more like pandora's box. Once you pick this book up it is difficult to put it down. Each time I read this I feel like I'm reading it for the first time. If the right movie director got a hold of this, it would be a fascinating movie!
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Now listen up kids:  <br />The first time I listened to this CD, I absolutely abhorred it. But being a true fan of music and a fair judge (in most musical cases), I gave it a second chance. Soon I've gave it a 3rd and 4th and 5th chance, this musical work of art truly grows on you!  <br />Now I love it in its entirety; it's racy and new. Gwen constantly causes us to redefine our idea of pop music by pushing the boundaries and entering new terrain. Those who are close-minded and content with the same old pop riffs will not appreciate this CD.  <br />Those of you who are open and ready for something new, go for it! Gwen will not disappoint. <br /> <br />Personal favorites:  <br />Wind it Up---- Simply ingenious to weave in much-loved Sound of Music tunes  <br />Orange County Girl---- fun and infectious    <br />Don't Get It Twisted----  wonderful harmony <br />The Sweet Escape---- great with Akon's lovely contribution   <br />Wonderful Life---- beautiful song, slows things up a bit
B0000457HB|5.0|\\"The Ultimate Collection,\\" is indeed a classic. Every track on this CD is great. Barry White's music never fails to please. Highly recommended.
B000067IW0|5.0|Not many films can classified as both artistically seminal and an expression of a national (or societal) self, but this particular movie is just that. Not only is Caligari the first really great horror movie, it is also one of the first to make its horrific point clearly and logically. In this way it is the precursor of all horror films since-- or should I say all good horror films. Moreover the mise-en-scene is so radically conceived and consistently followed through that there is not a moment in it that does not repay close study. Glib comments about German Expression do this film no harm, but they don't get anywhere near the finely wrought complexity of the characters and their circumstances. The film is dated 1920, the very beginning of the Weimar Republic and furious outburst of artistic activity that occurred during that troubled 12-13 year period which ended with the take-over of Hitler and his NADSP. Caligari is an expression of Expressionism all right, but it is also a declaration of who and what Weimar was to be. In other words this movie is as much a political statement of artistic and intellectual freedom as it is a simple horror flick. See this film and enjoy it: that's the first requisite of any artistic work. But don't see it once. See it many times. Have fun with it: try to find a right angle for instance. In the end, you will come to the conclusion that not one frame is carelessly placed, not one character miscast, and not one moment of sheer horror is left to stand on its own. This is great filmaking. It is also a great expression of freedom. No film of this sort could have been made anywhere other than Germany at this moment; it is a unique expression of an optimism that died with the Nazis.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|All songs are wonderful. Especially like when she sings those unbelievable high notes. She has the energy even those singers in their 20s don't have. Fly like a bird is timeless. Shake is off is fun and girl-power. Don't miss this album! (and great price too)
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Can bjork do any wrong? Not in my book! she takes on a new style, replacing her drum machines with stomps, taps, industrial noises and melancholy as an accompniament. On its own, this is a beautiful precursor to Vespertine, inkling here and there to the microcosmic noises to come on the next album. In her style, it sends you from whispers to guttaral soars, but more punctually and neccessarily than on her other albums. gorgeous!
B000ERU5EK|5.0|What a great compilation by the British dj trio! Absolutely mind blowing, the best progressive trance/synth-pop record of the year 2006. Every track is jamming. Not a single dull moment. If you like this then you will like Tiesto's ISOS # 5 which also came out the same year. Stay tuned for the new album Anjunabeats:Worldwide for more of Above and Beyond. It contains lot of previously unreleased tracks which were only heard previously on 'Trance Around the World' by Above and Beyone Live radio broadcasts. The 2nd cd of Anjunabeats:Worldwide contains a track called M.I.R.A which is a killer! Above and Beyond Rocks!!
B000002LRX|4.0|Faith No more, Classic Melodies, Eternal Tunes, Quirky Lyrics angel dust for sure! Songs I never get tired of hearing, even after years and years. Mike Patton is a complicated one-man orchestra not out ther for to make the easily digestible. Subtle musical intricacies and weaving insrtuments, I hear something new every time. Composition wise, I'd rank him up there with Mozart. A few songs fall a little short,  but where they're on, they're very on.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns 'N Roses...My favorite band...the best band ever. Every song on this cd is awesome. I have everyone of their cd's and none of them have let me down. \\"Nightrain\\" is my favorite of all time.

0143034901|4.0|I do agree that this novel is a bit over-hyped, and probably poorly compared with some higher literature.  However, despite all my cynicism, I was very charmed by this book.<br /><br />While this story did not hold many surprises for me, and yes, perhaps there is some validity one can infer to the \\"soap opera\\" references, it is well executed just the same.  Zafon is clearly a very talented writer, the translation is absolutely beautiful, and the characters and setting provided a pleasant escape.<br /><br />Do not take this work too seriously, enjoy the long ride and lush scenery.  Do not let the hype or comparisons taint your expectations and you will enjoy this novel for what it is.  Not timeless literature, but a nice diversion nonetheless.<br /><br />I found this book reminded me of the films Malena, A Very Long Engagement and Cinema Paradiso, and was not surprised to find Zafon has written screenplays.  If given to a capable, foreign director, this would be on par with those films.
0743442539|5.0|I finally read The Spy Who Came In from the Cold by John le Carre after reading a bunch of excellent reviews regarding the book.  The reviews have been from every corner, including my fellow Amazon reviewers, professional reviewers, and other famous authors such as Daphne du Maurier.  I decided to begin at the beginning (after reading Absolute Friends) so I read Call from the Dead, and a Murder of Quality.  Those books were intriguing and made for decent reads, however, le Carre seems to hit his stride and peak with The Spy Who Came In from the Cold.  The book starts out with a steady pace, nothing spectacular, then wham... it builds a head of steam and becomes un-putt-downable (not sure if that's a word, but it applies nonetheless).  Alec Leamas makes for a very compelling and complex character.  George Smiley takes backstage to Leamas and the spies from the other side.  I love the simple nuances of this book, in particular in the description of the need to know the preference between pins or paperclips.  I got the impression that this book could stand as a textbook for those entering the field of espionage.  A true 5 star read.  Highly recommended, in fact, required reading for those interested in the espionage/thriller genre.
0618680004|3.0|Having enjoyed and learned from many of Professor Dawkins' writings about evolutionary theory and genetics, I was interested in why he thinks that believing in God is a delusion.  I expected to find some detailed scientific experiments establishing this point.  While the book certainly contains references to science and some experiments, I was disappointed to find that the book actually takes the approach that many high school students use in their debates.  You demonize the other side by pointing out its worst flaws . . . and hope that no one notices your flaws.<br /><br />Let me briefly summarize his major points.  If you understand what those points are, you'll be in a better position to judge whether this book is right for you.<br /><br />1.  You can be impressed by the complexity and beauty of the world around you without believing in God.<br /><br />2.  Smart people (and almost all scientists you've ever heard of) don't believe in God.<br /><br />3.  Religious people are a threat to smart people and scientific inquiry.<br /><br />4.  Arguments for religious beliefs deserve no special respect.<br /><br />5.  The theological, philosophical and historical arguments for God's existence don't impress Professor Dawkins in logical or scientific terms.<br /><br />6.  The enormity of the Universe suggests that God (if He exists) is highly unlikely.<br /><br />7.  Morality doesn't need religion to be pursued.<br /><br />8.  Reading the Bible or Koran will incite you to behave in monstrous ways, such as by destroying those you perceive as being opposed to your religion.<br /><br />9.  Many arguments against atheists are based on faulty information.<br /><br />10. Many religious people are very hostile to everyone who is not of their beliefs.<br /><br />11. Religious experience is based on people being ignorant of the facts or deluding themselves with wishful thinking.<br /><br />11. Creationism (and Intelligent Design) are harmful beliefs.<br /><br />12. Having more people not believe in God will create room for better living and thinking.<br /><br />13. Children should be protected from being taught religious beliefs by their parents.<br /><br />As I read the book, I felt like I was seeing the thoughts of someone who can only see the world through the filter of the scientific method and the latest scientific \\"facts\\" and theories.  Having seen how often scientific \\"fact\\" turns out to be wrong (as pointed out by other scientists a few years later), I find that single filter to be a fragile basis for determining if God exists . . . especially when Professor Dawkins doesn't employ the scientific method in his search for an answer.  That suggests that Professor Dawkins is simply trying to defend his beliefs, something we are all entitled to do.<br /><br />As a trained historian, I was struck by how much weight he puts on some historians' perceptions of whether or not certain biblical events took place or not.  Historians are usually aware that getting things right over thousands of years is pretty near impossible for them to do.<br /><br />As a student of the Bible, I also think that Professor Dawkins is better at picking at particular passages than he is at reading the overall message of the Bible.  In places, we are told that God has superseded the old and replaced the old with new rules, for example.  Thus, we shouldn't follow the old rules.  Many of the extremes Professor Dawkins points out are superseded rules in the Christian faith.<br /><br />Professor Dawkins is on solid ground where he points out that most believers have never read their own holy books and often hold opinions that are contrary to what those books say.  Based on those erroneous opinions, extreme behavior that is not called for in the holy books is pursued.  That's clearly regrettable.<br /><br />What's the basic point?  Davy Crockett probably said it best.  \\"Be sure you're right.  Then go ahead.\\"  Too many people are assuming that first step (that they are right), rather than checking out their understanding before acting.<br /><br />I didn't find that believing in God is a delusion after reading this book. If that's what you want to learn, you may find that reading this atheist's arguments will convince you that your faith is justified.  Or you could simply reaffirm your faith in some other way.<br /><br />If you want to explore whether to become an atheist, I suspect you can find a better book than this one.  I haven't read one so I cannot make a recommendation in that regard.<br /><br />Ultimately, I suspect that the tone of the book in downgrading religion and religious impulses is heavily influenced by the often obnoxious treatment that Professor Dawkins has received from religious people who oppose his views on evolution and genetics. I hope he will learn to forgive them.e assuming that first step (that they are right), rather than checking out their understanding before acting.   <br /> <br />I didn't find that believing in God is a delusion after reading this book.

B000002J1U|4.0|Somewhere around 1970 I was a whiskerfree newly minted teenager who fell under the spell of Led Zeppelin.  Enjoying lots of quality time with LZI and LZII I didn't have to think twice about adding LZIII to my collection. That being said, I certainly noted somewhat of a departure in sound and approach with the release of III.  I liked it alot though. <br /> <br />Now many moonlit miles later, if you were to put me on the spot and tell me I can only take one Led Zeppelin album forward in my travels I think I would choose III. <br /> <br /> A shame that those who have  discovered the House of LZ in the CD age can't  enjoy the original rivetted spinning images LP jacket but, it's the music on the disc that really matters.  Check it out!
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I would think that Beowulf would be a difficult story to adapt to the cinematic screen. The outline of the story is clear enough. The hero, Beowulf, helps a king whose drinking hall is beset by a monster who kills all who sleep there. Beowulf kills the monster and then kills the monster's mother. What is unclear from the story is what the monster is and what, if any, motivations there are beyond heroic slaughter. This film corrects that and does so in a plausible manner. <br /> <br />Grendel is a troll, a sort of human. Years ago, Hrothgar killed a troll while staking out his claim on his land. Watching this happen is the small child, Grendel. Years later, Grendel has grown up into a full sized troll and is out for vengeance. He has a score to settle. He makes distinctions between those who can hurt him (warriors) and those who can't. He also distinguishes between those with whom he has a grudge (Hrothgar's Danes) and those with whom he does not. Beowulf does not make such fine distinctions, at least at first. He is out to play the hero who does great deeds. <br /> <br />He does his great deeds, eventually with a bit of regret, and manages to slay the monster and then the monster's vengeance minded mother. It is all pretty well in keeping with the saga. It is also entertaining. <br /> <br />The film is well done. All of the imagery evokes the time and the place. It is a good action film.  <br />
B000CFLFX4|4.0|I bought this to handle the wood floors in my living room, dining room, and my ceramic floors in my kitchen.  For that it works great.  I noticed that it doesn't work well on carpets but that isn't what I expected it to do.  Basically it is a electonic broom and dust pan.
1576751988|4.0|I always feel like there is so much to do and not enough time but this book helped me realize that I should do the most important thing first.  That was the total opposite to my practise.  I would try to get the small stuff out of the way and all the big stuff would keep adding up. <br /> <br />Great book, quick read and very practical.
0743298020|5.0|Every now and then you read a novel where you forget it is fiction.  This is one of those novels.  While reading the book I found myself thinking about the characters while I was at work.  I remember walking down a hall, pondering the characters.  I was trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle together to solve the mystery.  I had to remind myself that these characters were not real.  They are mere letters strung together to form words and finally sentences, not living cells strung together to form flesh and finally life.  Ms Setterfield has pulled it off though.  She has taken letters and weaved them together so artfully that life has been breathed into them.  I cannot recall the last time I read a novel that was so well written.
0307341542|5.0|A person could easily read this book in one sitting.  That is to say it is reasonable in length, you're entertained and you get all your questions answered when you're done.  Some authors spend a lot of time \\"setting up\\" the plot, like Stephen King, but this book goes right into what it's about and keeps you going - no fluff. <br /> <br />They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover but I did and it paid off.  The cover is unique and so is the story.  I would definitely read another book by this author.

B000002MTU|3.0|Eric Clapton is an excellent musician, and he has produced great songs and great performances for decades.  He is respected by almost everyone in the industry, and no doubt he has left his mark on the music world.<br /><br />However, in this CD he merely tries to copy the genius of other men and doesn't attempt to change the style.  Freddie King, Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, Albert King, Otis Rush can all be heard on the CD.  Usually when one remakes a song it is done better or at least in his own style.  Not in this case.  Clapton fails to measure up to the originals.<br /><br />But at the same time one must give him credit for not watering it down.  A lot of times performers will take ethnic music and popularize it for a mainstream audience.  Clapton does not do this on this CD, and one must give a round of applause for this.<br /><br />But if you want good blues that cuts deep into your soul, check out recordings of live performances of the above referenced musicians as well as live recordings of Albert Collins, Howard and the White Boys, Popa Chubby, Big Gilson, and Johnny Clyde Copeland.
B000056H7W|5.0|This is the first CD that has completely changed my mind about an entire genre of music that I previously thought I hated. There is no mistaking the fact that Opeth is a death metal band, nor the notion that a fan of jam bands, classical music, jazz, and world music would not be too open to Opeth's sound at first. But Blackwater Park has taught me that metal, beauty, aggression, virtuosity, and composition can exist in one intense and unified sonic space. Mikael Akerfeld is somewhere on the order of a genius, and his bandmates are more than up to the task of performing - no, not a mistake in word choice - the pieces that make up this darkly beautiful landscape. From the heart-pounding opening of The Leper Affinity to the simple unaccompanied guitar postlude of the title track, Opeth's songs move through musical moods and colors with an almost classical-esque ease. The jewels of this album are Leper Affinity, Bleak, Dirge for November, and Blackwater Park...the last of these is a 13-minute exposition of the astonishing abilities of this band, with some of the best riffs and acoustic/electric interplays I have heard anywhere. It's also a great test for an audio system or headphones; if they show the rawness and refinement that somehow coexist in this track, they're a good buy. <br /> <br />If you listen enough times, you even get used to Akerfeld's growling, almost blending organically with the bass. Hints of Opeth's primary influence, Led Zeppelin, abound in Blackwater Park, but Akerfeld's voice falls at the opposite end of the spectrum of the talented Robert Plant. Like his Zep predecessor, Akerfeld can stop growling or screaming and sing quite nicely when he chooses to. (\\"A Fair Judgment\\" on the album \\"Deliverance\\" is ample evidence of this.) If you think you hate death metal, make sure to listen to this album the entire way through and see if you can hang on to that opinion. My friend who introduced me to Opeth calls them the \\"gateway band\\" for non-metal fans. Sure, my standards for metal bands are quite high - I expect a band the caliber of Opeth, or I'm not too interested - but true to my friend's description, these Swedish guys have opened my mind to an entire genre that I had previously, and far too quickly, closed off.

B00028HBKM|5.0|No word can accurately describe this epoc produced by Mel Gibson.  This is the first time any movie production has made an effort to depict the true gruesomeness and agony that Christ suffered on that last day.  Yes, this makes for an incredibly gory film, yet at the same time, the gore isn't for the sake of gross, it is to try to be true to the very real event in history.<br /><br />For the believer - it should be impossible to sit through it without being totally and completely overwhelmed by Christ's suffering.  If you have a dry eye after watching this - you need to re-evaluate your relationship with Christ.<br /><br />For the unbeliever - THIS is how much God loves you - that he gave his only Son to pay such a horrible price that you could not possibly pay yourself - for your sin.<br /><br />Watch this movie.  It will change how you look at Jesus Christ.
B000HIVQK8|3.0|A package really worth having if your a collector, my only problem with it is the waste on the DVD with it.

0316096199|5.0|I wish that there was a public email address for Alice Sebold because I would like her to know how much \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and \\"Lucky\\" have impacted me.  This woman is an amazing writer!  For those reviewers who have the audacity to give even four stars -- would you be able to write down in detail the most horrific event of your life so vividly and open without falling to pieces?  The writing is incredibly controlled.  I couldn't find a hint of emotion.  Just a lot of sarcasm which at times I find funny -- a true defense mechanism for not breaking down.  This book deserves five stars -- period!  Just for the courage and bravery and work it took to experience the evil over and over again.  In first drafts, in second drafts, in third drafts, in copyediting...every time this manuscript came back, she had to revisit that scene over and over again.

I wanted to own a copy of the \\"Yong Vic\\" concert so I decided to get this deluxe edition. I believe this deluxe edition is remastered from the original \\"Who's Next master tapes. I hear other people tell me different stories but either way this deluxe edition is a joy to hear as the remastering is exceptional. I had to get this edition once I knew \\"The Young Vic\\" concert performed on 4/26/71 was to be on disc two. I like the fact that The Who played this concert four months before the release of of their masterpiece \\"Who's Next\\", playing five of the songs that would be on that lp. The Vic concert does sound a little sloppy and amazingly enlighting but really a great historic live rock recording and makes this deluxe edition a well worth buy. I get a real kick out of hearing \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" before it was actually released world wide, along with the other four \\"Who's Next\\" future releases. Cd one has the New York Record Plant Sessions on tracks 10 to 15 and are a really interesting listen as I always wanted to hear these New York versions before they were originally rejected for the albums final release. The linear notes have been updated since the 1995 edition. Fm radio has played most of the \\"Who's Next\\" song list out, but not enough to over play this masterpiece. This cd delux edition makes \\"Who's Next\\" sound brilliantly fresh and new. If you dont want to go for the extra money for this deluxe edition, just stick to the 1995 single remastered cd, either way you wont be dissapointed...........
B0000AQS0F|5.0|what a treat...as an avid sci fi fan i'm always looking for something new. How many remakes of king kong can a person take before they become a clock tower sniper? serenity and the shows had it all. action, adventure, romance. more importantly it was set up to answer the hidden questions,i.e, two by two hands of blue? What of the others like River? it had so many places to go. what a shame it'll never get there. but, i'd invest. jan baldwin
0143034901|4.0|A tortuous, sometimes ponderous tour through the streets of an uncharacteristically damp, forboding pre-WWII Barcelona - a mystery in search of meaning, featuring the only copy of the last novel by a brillant, but almost unknown author. Young novel sleuth Daniel narrates most of it, and participates in most of the four or five romances - one of his women friends narrates the rest (in a letter after death). A good memory or pencil and paper is necessary to keep tract of all the intriguingly loveable and hateable characters and the several parallel plots (tied together by a Monte Blanc pen and a genious, oversexed rogue, with a heart of gold) Thankfully it all converges nicely in the end, bringing about one of the most welcome feel-good endings I have experienced for a while. Probably to be a classic. Not a fast read, but worth the effort
B000F1IQN2|5.0|This was an eye opener to me since it gets to the bottom of how to fight people who stalk and kill (for whatever reason).This type comes under the \\"predator\\" heading where the stalking is much more important than the actual kill. A predator cannot live in a society; by nature they are solitary and removed.The reason they kill is really neither here nor there since the whole thing is an aberration of reality.Thus, when Israel sent normal people to behave as predators to find predators and kill them we get to see a natural breakdown in their thinking and the fear that results from performing (what is for them) an unnatural act.I agree with the movies end; catch them and bring them to trial in the same manner Nazi criminals were handled.To become a killer to catch a killer makes no sense and will only produce another round of the same kind of thinking.
B00005221M|5.0|Director Michael Mann's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" is an incredible cinematic experience. I don't often go to the theater and I even rarer see films multiple times (at the theater, that is), but when \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" was released in 1992 I saw it twice. I then got my hands on the VHS as soon as I could.<br /><br />I recently watched the VHS again and was incredibly moved! The original VHS is, incidentally, the theatrical release of the film. I was reminded of all the numerous elements that make \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" the definitive reason why people make and watch motion pictures in the first place. I was so moved, in fact, that I was compelled to buy the \\"Director's Expanded Edition,\\" which many fans criticize, mainly due to the omission of the Clannad song (\\"I Will Find You\\") and a smattering of supposedly hip lines by Nathaniel.<br /><br />I'll compare the theatrical release to the director's cut at the end of this review. Allow me to first point out the numerous highlights of the film:<br /><br />-- The casting is perfect: Daniel Day-Lewis as Nathaniel, Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, Wes Studi as Magua -- heck, everyone's fabulous.<br /><br />-- The score by Randy Edelman is one of the greatest in motion picture history. It's as good or better than any you can think of, including \\"Conan the Barbarian,\\" \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" \\"The Last Valley,\\" \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\\" etc.<br /><br />-- The plot is simple and the film runs less than two hours, but there's a definite epic scope to the picture. More than that, the ambiance of the film is equal parts historic, realistic, pure, brutal, beautiful and reverent.<br /><br />-- This film contains one of the greatest non-soap operatic love stories in motion picture history. During the \\"Look of Love\\" sequence Nathaniel stops and turns to gaze at Cora. Cora looks up and asks, \\"What are you looking at, Sir?\\" Nathaniel simply responds, \\"I'm looking at you, Miss.\\" Cora finally looks back at him; first hesitatingly, then fully, then finally with a knowing smile. They just look at each other and Nathaniel returns the smile, turns and departs. Without a word, we KNOW that Nathaniel and Cora are in profound awe and love of each other. Later, when they finally passionately embrace it's potent and moving. This simple scene blows away any overt love-making scene you can think of.<br /><br />-- The primal Magua is a great villain, compelled to hatred, bitterness and revenge for numerous understandable reasons.<br /><br />-- Magua's two pow-wow interludes with the French general (Patrice Chereau) are imaginative, surreal and powerful.<br /><br />-- The French and Indian War skirmishes and Fort battles are realistic, compelling and brutal.<br /><br />-- Cora's sister Alice (Jodhi May) is only 15 years old and the fierceness of the frontier is simply too overwhelming for her. She almost commits suicide but Uncas (Eric Schweig) saves her.<br /><br />-- After Nathaniel and his Indian stepfather and stepbrother barely escape the clutches of Magua by jumping from a waterfall there's an unexpected and powerful interlude featuring the magnificent Clannad song \\"I Will Find You.\\" Unfortunately this song was inexplicably cut from the director's edition. Apparently Mann felt it was anachronistic; it's not, it perfectly fits the feel and era of the picture.<br /><br />-- Although Major Heyward comes off as a ultra pro-British dork, he ultimately proves his bravery and noble character.<br /><br />-- One of the most memorable scenes is Alice's ultimate response to the prospect of living the rest of her life as Magua's slave-squaw. I cannot describe how magnificent and moving this episode is!<br /><br />-- The picture was filmed in glorious Chimney Rock Park in Western North Carolina. One reviewer fittingly called the film an \\"Eastern.\\"<br /><br />-- The entire 15-20 minute climax, which includes Chingachgook's final fight with Magua, is compelling, imaginative and flawless. Chingachgook is played by Russell Means, by the way.<br /><br />COMPARING THE THEATRICAL CUT TO THE DIRECTOR'S CUT: I feel Michael Mann's cut is superior to the theatrical cut of the film. He only adds about 3-4 minutes of extra footage and it all works, with the possible exception of Chingachgook's near cringe-inducing final rant at the climax. Mann cut every one of Nathaniel's silly \\"hip\\" statements, which was a good decision in my opinion (not that they were THAT bad, but they simply weren't very realistic; fun maybe, but not realistic). As already noted, Mann's biggest mistake was to cut out the perfectly-fitting Clannad song. In the new cut that sequence just plays out in an unimpressive, bland manner. All I can say is that I'm glad I have the VHS because I can still play the Clannad song-sequence when I get to that particular scene (of course, the theatrical release has been released on DVD as well).<br /><br />Anyway, don't listen to these people who rail against the director's cut mainly because of the omission of the Clannad song. They're right that Mann should never have cut the song but, other than that, his new cut is actually superior to the original (although I admit that I'd rather have the original cut WITH the Clannad song than the new cut WITHOUT it).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is simply one of the greatest films ever made. Sometimes I'm guilty of being over-generous in my film ratings, but not with this one.<br /><br />GRADE: A+ssell Means, by the way.<br /><br />COMPARING THE THEATRICAL CUT TO THE DIRECTOR'S CUT: I feel Michael Mann's cut is superior to the theatrical cut of the film.

B000ICM5MG|5.0|Quite a claim, huh? But this DVD, the third DVD release of Stallone's greatest film and creation, is truly the \\"be all, end all\\" of this film. So many extras, even on just the movie disc alone! Believe anyone here on Amazon that gave \\"this\\" DVD version of Rocky 5 stars, it's a must!<br /><br />Instead of repeating all those great reviews and descriptions of the discs, I'll post the DVD's Easter Egg! On Disc Two, select \\"In The Ring:Three-Part Making-Of Documentary\\". Once in it's menu, you'll automatically be on \\"Play All\\", but push LEFT on your remote, and you'll hear a bell and a pair of red boxing gloves will appear on the left. Now just press ENTER and you'll be treated to the three minute short \\"Rocky Meets Stallone\\", where Sly and Balboa exchange gratitudes between each other!<br /><br />Get the DVD, not just for the Oscar winning movie, but for all the extras as well!
B0006IIPJ4|5.0|All our family including Grandma enjoyed this film at the cinema where it looked it's best (except my 10 year old daughter who found it far too scary). It has loads of references to 30-50's sci-fi and film noire. There's direct quotes from Orson Welles `War of the Worlds' radio broadcast, images raided from Lost Horizon (with a rather decimated Shangri-la after the mad scientist has visited), and even a hint of The Matrix in the case of mysterious femme fatale Bai Ling. The acting is as intentionally 'wooden' as the 30's adventure originals like Buster Crabbe, but Joe 'Sky Captain' Sullivan [Law] and Polly Perkins [Paltrow] create a believable pair of heroic charactors. Polly is particularly impressive with never a hair out of place or a broken nail throughout.  <br /> <br />It's all filmed as if it was a 30's film of the future (hence the 'world of tomorrow') - so the British Empire's also on hand to help out - in the guise of a superb Angelina Jolie as Franky with her fantastic flying aircraft carriers. The invading robots are really great and even Sir Larry Olivier gets a bit part as the Wizard of Oz. Also watch out for King Kong's log bridge (and no-one wondered why he lived with dinosaurs). Being wary of heights I found the final scenes particularly tense (hero Jude Law copes rather well though). This film seems to provoke an intense love it or loathe it reaction with the bold use of B&W sepia colour tones and 'retro-future' style. It also makes 'The day the world stood still' and the 'Iron Giant' seem very mono-robotic. So can Flash, sorry Sky Captain, save the world from sinister Dr. Totenkopf [Deathshead] 's evil plot in under 150 minutes ?
0375831002|5.0|It's 4:30 in the morning.   I have been sobbing for the last hour.  I just finished The Book Thief.  The book is sad and funny and wrenching and horrible and wonderful.  It's prose is like poetry.  Read it, it will touch you.

0790730960|4.0|I watched this movie a long time ago and enjoyed it enormously. <br /> <br />All the characters make the movie entertaining to say the least.  There's the vicious Penguin, the threatening Red Triangle circus gang, the elusive Batman, the mysterious Alfred and the half-insane Catwoman. <br /> <br />The most interesting character for me was Selina Kyle (Catwoman).  She was a mass of contradictions. <br /> <br />Seeing her fight between her own insanity and humanity was quite fascinating.  The scenes where she and Batman are together are electric in the sense that both of them have deep psychological issues. <br /> <br />Selina also uttered a quote that seems to relate to everyday life for most people.  \\"I would love to go home with you and live with you in your castle.  But that's not how life is.\\" <br /> <br />Straight up the movie was good and the settings were eerily beautiful and ghoulish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002J09|4.0|I have known the name of Led Zeppelin for years, and with the exception of Kashmir (which is a great tune), I had never really heard any of their music.  I had heard bits and pieces here and there, but never full pieces.  Then one day I was watching VH1 classics, they actually play music videos unlike MTV, and saw a live performance for Stairway to Heaven.  As formerly noted, I hadn't heard any of their songs from start to finish, so I watched it.  I have to say that I was really impressed with the song.  The levels and mood that the song created blew me away.  I was so dazzled that I sought out what album it was on, because I had to have it.<br /><br />Now after some research, I discovered that Stairway to Heaven is on the Led Zeppelin IV or ZOSO, or whatever name you want to call it, since the album doesn't have an official name.  Since I was going to buy this CD, only knowing one song on the album I wanted to know what I was in for.  So I am going to list each song track by track, in order to give a candid and fair review of this classic rock album.<br /><br />1) Black Dog - This is a fast rock song.  Has a good guitar riffs, catchy vocals and can get the feet moving.<br /><br />2) Rock and Roll - I have heard this song before and never realized it was Led Zeppelin.  This song is the epitome of classic hard rock.  An ageless tune.<br /><br />3) The Battle of Evermore - I am not sure how to describe this song, but perhaps the weakest song on the album.  It is a duet with Robert Plant and Sandy Denny.  Now it depends on my mood, but sometimes I like this song and other times I can't stand it.  Strange I know.  Robert and Sandy sing sometimes separate and other times together.  Now Robert Plant's voice is high pitch and many times he guffaws, and in many cases or songs, it works.  Consequently in this song, between Robert's shrieking and Sandy's yelling, it sounds like two cats fighting and/or a banshee and a spider monkey laughing at Hee-Haw reruns.  As for the music itself, it there is a dark feel to it.  Consequently, the music never seems to go anywhere.<br /><br />4) Stairway to Heaven - What can I say?  Not to sound like a poser or jumping on the bandwagon, but this is why I bought the CD.  What an immaculate song with myriad layers.  So many coatings and poetic lyrics that read like an allegory.  A moving piece that begins mellow reaches a pinnacle, which is pseudo hard rock.  Then ends as soft as it started.  From my understanding, this is the most requested song on the radio.  I just wonder how the radio is able to play an eight-minute song start without a commercial?<br /><br />5) Misty Mountain Hop - There are more astonishing guitar riffs creating a good rock and roll vibe. The vocal harmonization is excellent in this song as well.<br /><br />6) Four Sticks - Wonderful drums going on in this song, they really seem to stand out.  I see a woman doing a strip tease to this song.  I don't know why, I just do.  The only downfall is at the end.  This is where Mr. Bobby Plant goes a little crazy with his classic rock screaming in the last 30-40 seconds of the song.<br /><br />7) Going To California - A soft acoustic like song.  Some might consider it a folk melody, I really like this track.  It's also rather short, only about three minutes long.  This and Stairway to Heaven are the only slower songs on the album.<br /><br />8) When The Levee Breaks - An eight-minute long piece of music I can hear being played in a shady bar somewhere in Texas.  The harmonica and drums really set the framework for a blues-rock song.  Guitar riffs and vocals give a strong rock n' roll flare.  The mood of this song is somewhat abrasive and erratic.  A strong piece of music and a great way to close this album.<br /><br />Not sure why so much comparing between Led Zeppelin with Dire Straits, Foreigner and Green Day.  When I hear the name Led Zeppelin I don't think of the former bands.  It is almost like using this statement as a frame of reference: \\" Dude Tupac sucks, you should listen Barry Manilow.\\"<br /><br />I hope I was able to provide more insight to Led Zeppelin IV.  Overall not a long album but has some solid tracks that have made it a legend in the realm of classic rock.able to provide more insight to Led Zeppelin IV.  Overall not a long album but has some solid tracks that have made it a legend in the realm of classic rock.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|A gun on a wall to shoot-this slogan is the most relevant and to the point quintessence of a hyperbolized set of events linking people of four distant countries with common for all human beings features: thirst for sex, egoism, stupidity and a callous ignorance to others' problems.<br /><br />It is a very sad story leaving,perhaps, some room for a happy end in the future.

1582701709|4.0|If you read this book with an open mind and look for a new idea or two that will help you, the book will have great value.  If, on the other hand, you read this book looking for the ridiculous or unbelievable, you will find it.  When you try to translate meaning from what others say literally it may lead to confusion or unrealistic expectations.  But there is plenty of value in what others say about their experiences and beliefs if you consider it thoughtfully and apply your own creativity to what you learn.  In this book, which is a very handsome, small format edition, I especially appreciate the summaries that conclude the chapters.  From these I can find one or two phrases that resonate with what I would now like to think more about.
032147404X|3.0|I have read this book thoroughly and while it does give SOME information, I would have preferred there to be MORE information.  Under the picture on each page there are general suggestions on how to achieve that picture however, I would have definitely preferred information such as; \\"for this picture I used blah blah setting, blah blah exposure etc.,\\" and the pros and cons of not using other settings.  The quote on the front of the book states 'The step-by-step secrets for how to make your photos look like the pros', and I have to say that that ISN'T what the book does.  There is no step-by-step anything, just vague ideas.  I gave this book three stars because of the scant information it gives but as a 'beginner' in Digital Photography with a Nikon D40 this book hasn't helped me at all.
B00005JPDJ|4.0|What happens when two heartbroken women swap their lives (or most of it) for a holiday season? Predictably, it would be to revel in the little or large pleasures the life of another person would bring. To that extent `Holiday' is full of rather predictable outcomes with Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet both eventually finding some love and some solace for their broken hearts. That the final outcome of their foreign ventures has been left to the audience's imagination helps the viewer focus on the `Holiday' aspect of the experience and not look beyond.<br /><br />`Holiday' succeeds in making the audience feel good with a Christmas time story about finding love away from home. The script's unwillingness to delve into possibilities that would have been - if the script were willing to explore outcomes less inevitable - means that the movie ends up being a typical Hollywood feel good movie. But then trying outcomes less predictable would deprive `Holiday' of its essence. In all, it is a good movie for a weekend but not the one that would excite a critic.

B00009P1MP|4.0|\\"American Pie\\" is an undisputed classic.  The remastered CD sounds quite faithful to the original, as I remember it.  However, I would not have bought this item had I known that Capitol packaged it in a cheap cardboard sleeve.  I would have gladly paid (a little) more to get this in a traditional plastic jewel case, which protects the disc much better.  Packaging aside, I'm glad to add it to my collection.

0446528056|4.0|There are many of Sparks' books that I can immerse myself into and know that it will be an enjoyable read. Unfortuneately this was not the case with \\"Dear John\\". I became bored with the subject matter at times and the ending made me feel unfullfilled.
B0000074FL|5.0|Superb album, from the beginning to the end. Not a mistake.  <br /> <br />1 - Angel of Death - Nice lyrics (little inspiration on Stones' simpathy for the devil), powerful song, 6 minutes of ecstasy - 9,0. <br /> <br />2 - Renegade - To me, the weekest of the album, but still a classic. \\"He's just a boy, that's all\\", it cannot be better than this. The main problem os this song is that it goes round and round in circles and doesn't go anywhere. 8,0 <br /> <br />3 - The pressure will blow. Really makes your pressure blow. Typical Lizzy song, that's why is so perfect. Change your pint for vodka during this one. 10,0 <br /> <br />4 - Leave this Town - Nothing espetacular, but works fine here between 2 nervous shakedown pieces. It's the kind of song that you don't love, but once in a year you caught yourself singing it. 8,0 <br /> <br />5 - Hollywood. Sweet hollywood... Nice lyrics, you are on your own, pal. Hook you since the very first second. 10,0 <br /> <br />6 - No one told Him - Listen, closely, it's and underrated song. Like all the final 4 of this album. Love song, lizzy style, only phil was capable os doing that one. \\"But how can he forget? he hasn't got a friend.\\" 9,0 <br /> <br />7 - Jazzy, cool, groovy, inteligent, funky, bluesy, fusion. I don't what the f**k is it, but who cares, you still \\"love to swing\\" during this one. 9,0+, with class. <br /> <br />8 - Mexican Blood - Tequila in the jar. Imagine the best storyteller alive. Forget it. He died. And he was an irish boy, with some brazilian blood. My favorite of the album. 10 + <br /> <br />9 - It's getting Dangerous - That's the best definition ever of \\"climax\\". The song come bringing you to a totaly different level on every second, until it explodes like a damn dynamite. The only drug you need to consume is Thin Lizzy. 10. <br /> <br />We all want more Phil.

ALL YOU EMO KIDS OUT THERE GIVE THESE GUYS A BAD NAME!  Just because they have a couple sad songs such as the first track [helena] does not make them emo.  nor does the ammount of makeup thy wear!  They're main influences consist of the MISFITS, MORRISEY, and IRON MAIDEN. I repeat they are not emo.  The chemistry of this bad is amazing.  The 2 guitar players, [frank lero, ray toro] come from totally different musical backgrounds, which come together beautifully, to make MCR's FAST, AGRESSIVE, beatiful punk/melodic sound.  I give this album a 5 out of 5 stars.
0714843377|5.0|The title tells it all. It's not How Good You Are, Its How Good You Want to Be. Inspiration is very hard to get these days, I think it is a great motivational book for anyone who wants to be great. To some, the book may seem short and without much to say. I would say read deeper and you will see that wisdom is not in long words, it is in the right ones!<br /><br />I would recommend this book especially to young creatives and to those who got lost along the way. It is a great and easy read in which you will come back again and again for the words to sink deeper. As a very wise man said, motivation is motive in action. If your motive is greatness, you should act on it!

0066620996|4.0|I have read this book 3 years ago and I am still pursuing greatness for my agency. I think Jim Collins did the opposite of many conventional writers. Generally business thinkers and writers have an opinion and they try to find the appropriate examples and shift them into their philosophy, using these examples to justify their point of view. Jim Collins did the opposite, he first investigated and collected a massive amount of data, then came up with theories and a conclusion. I personally believe, that many business examples today are over-used and many of the theories are not fresh anymore. I am sick and tired of Coca Cola, Apple or Starbucks examples. Therefore, I think Jim Collin's effort is worth an applause. It is a great book that drives from real information. Many of the examples are fresh.<br /><br />As I told before, I am still in pursue of greatness for my company. It was a great inspirational book that made me think of techniques to apply these principles to real life. I would recommend this book to all top level business leaders who aspires greatness for their organisations.<br /><br />One last thing, \\"Good enough is Not Enough\\"!
0307346609|5.0|Taking a subject that was created in a movie and expanding on it is perfectly done here.  The narrarative and point of view is quite vivid, and, being a big fan of the genre, puts a new spin on it.  Highly recommended.  A great read.
B000003C4K|5.0|Words just can't describe how great Exodus's debut album \\"Bonded by Blood\\" really is. I mean this is without a doubt one of the greatest thrash metal albums of the 80's. Whenever I listen to this album, I always get a serious kick of adrenaline rush. I mean this album is just heavy, fast, crazy, take no BS, in your face, headbanging old school thrash from start to finish. \\"Bonded by Blood\\" of course would be the first and only Exodus album with Paul Baloff on vocals. His vocals on here are just angry and all out pissed off throughout. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are very awesome guitarists. These guys rip right through your skin with wild thrashing riffs, and crazy fast dualing solos like a race car driver going 100 miles per hour. Rob McKillop's bass is pretty good, and Tom Hunting's drumming is just fast and all out merciless. Every song on here is just full of fast, crazy, thrashing heaviness, and very mosh pit worthy as well, including \\"Bonded by Blood\\", \\"Exodus\\", \\"Piranha\\", \\"Metal Command\\", \\"And Then There Were None\\", \\"Strike of the Beast\\", and of course \\"A Lesson in Violence\\" which is wihtout question one of Exodus's best songs ever and a true I DON'T GIVE A CRAP attitude like anthem as well. There's also some bonus live versions of \\"And Then There Were None\\", and \\"A Lesson in Violence\\" too. Bottom Line is this, if you're looking for some old school 80's thrash metal to just bang your head like freakin crazy, then by all means, you must own this album. LONG LIVE EXODUS!! R.I.P.

0312323867|5.0|Once again Emily Giffin did an awesome job! She got into the depth of Darcy's character(or lack thereof, at first) very well. Darcy matured this time around. Her experiences were complex and real to life. I could identify with Darcy thoughout the book when she was good and bad. I liked how the author brought out Darcy's strength and courage with the help of Ethan. He was truly awesome and her rock! The book exemplifies the intricate levels of love and friendship. THERE SHOULD BE A MOVIE ABOUT SOMETHING BORROWED AND BLUE COMBINED!!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Truly a family movie that we enjoy today as much as we did when it was first released. The only thing I think they should have changed is when the mother & all of the fish eggs except Nemo get eaten by the scary fish. THey could have come up with something different. It still doesn't sit well with my almost three yr old & my almost 5 yr old. They see it as Nemos mommy & brother & sisters. It's hard to explain to them why a bad fish ate Nemos mommy. Good grief...they could have gone with a less severe story line.<br /><br />Other than that...it is a wonderful movie in which I think DORY voiced by Ellen Degeneres steals the show.<br /><br />It will be a classic & enjoyed for many years to come!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|i think there are two types of people that are listening to this album: those expecting more catchy songs like \\"crazy,\\" and those who are digging deeper and exploring what is being presented here. <br /> <br />i find this album and its lyrics very refreshing, and i can relate to most of them (i'm still trying to figure out \\"necromancer\\" though).  as another reviewer said, the lyrics aren't very complex, but they manage to make up for this by carrying powerful undertones that give each song its own mood and purpose.  \\"transformer\\" and \\"just a thought\\" are two great examples. <br /> <br />this album is not a copy-and-pasted rearrangement of the hit single \\"crazy.\\"  if you aren't going to see past the catchy beat and vocals of this one song, i'd recommend that you purchase the single.  no two tracks sound alike here. <br /> <br />if you like gnarls and you're about to order this album, i'd suggest splurging and spending a couple extra bucks on the \\"deluxe\\" version.  it includes a bonus dvd with 4 (cool, but very weird) music videos, audio tracks of the live versions of \\"crazy\\" and \\"gone daddy gone,\\" and a neat little booklet with lyrics and artwork.  it'll make a nice addition to any music collection.
B000J103OI|3.0|Some people live to work.  As the late Frank Sinatra sang, \\"If you can make it there [New York], then you can make it anywhere.\\"  It is on this premise that nice woman, Andrea \\"Andie\\" Sacks (Anne Hathaway) comes to the Big Apple from the greater Chicago Area in order to make it as a columnist at a major periodical.  After an awkward interview, she lands a big job at fashion magazine 'Runway,'. She has to settle as a receptionist, but really is more of a personal assistant to the leading lady, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), whose every move makes or breaks the fashion industry.  Known as a \\"notorious sadist\\", Priestly lives to belittle and berate her subordinates.  \\"By all means, move at a glacial pace.  That always thrills me,\\" Miranda chortles.  She creates great tension, and Andie must act like \\"Radar O' Reilly\\" with a clairvoyance to forecast every whim of her starchy employer.  We get the point ad nauseam, but there's enough variety in the film to transcend its problems and misery.  Sometimes they beat the idea to death, but the movie takes enough free time to ponder on the estate of things.  There's her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Granier) and their friends who offer a relaxed atmosphere with a comraderie that rises above her fray.  On the other hand, there's the pressure to succeed and temptation from a vain competitor, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker).  The allure of success and a cosmopolitan man have her pondering between two roads.  (One road is the glory of high fashion; the other is down to earth.)  Less compelling is her competitive near superior, Emily (Emily Blunt) who seems to have worked so long for the franchise, she's acquired their bosses' accumen.  Almost implausibly, Andie comes to the defense of despicable people at her own expense.  (Is anyone that nice?)  Another supervisor high on the food chain is Nigel (played with proper bluster by Stanley Tucci), a blunt and fastidious figure who is the only one with enough humanity to eventually warm upto her.  Andie's smart and has a good work ethic, but the movie does a wonderful job presenting and sorting out her priorities.  Like the rest of us, many are tied to their cell phones like an ambilical chord.  Should she sever the ties or not?    'The Devil Wears Prada' is a surprisingly fun movie with a presentation that rises above ordinary sit-com fare.  It also refuses to entirely demonize the enemy.  Andie, to their credit, gains some self-confidence as she succumbs to a fashion make-over.  The villains are also presented with frailties and decency behind their thick skin.  Meryl Streep gives a relaxed prima dona performance; one that also makes us see her believable vulnerability behind her fashion facade.  She seems to walk through the role (although this is only testimony to her brilliance).  Everyone else delivers good, solid performances throughout.  Not giving a fig about fashion, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is an enjoyable and thoughtful release from what I thought would have been an overly labored effort.

B000068FUM|5.0|in 10+ years since hearing a couple of fine tracks off the Jayhawks 'Tomorrow the Green Grass' upon its release in '96, i realised i never got around to buying it (now a v. difficult opus to track down here in Australia). Since it arrived the other day from US (via Amazon) i haven't stopped playing it, & the tunes have stuck in my head since. Not merely a 'country' tinged album, the songs hold more to their basis than first appears, as do their musical arrangements. It has easily withstood the test of time hearing it again now...what some may term classic...but i simply term, damn fine!
B000L43AN4|3.0|Being a huge Tom Waits fan, I have always anxiously awaited each new offering.   <br /> <br />Until Real Gone. <br /> <br />I listened to it 3 times straight through, thinking, \\"This got great reviews, what am I missing?  Is it the 'human beat box' thing that's really grating, or the turnaround in Waits' persona from gruff bum heartbroke junkman to pacifist political whiner, or the lack of any hint of melody, whether beautiful or strange?\\" <br /> <br />Well, I think it's all of those things.  Which is why this \\"Orphans\\" collection is a mixed bag for me.  If you liked \\"Mule Variations\\" (which was half great to me--\\"Take it With Me\\" and \\"Hold On\\" are a couple of my favorite Waits tunes--while the other half was too strange and disjointed, long and slow for my taste) you'll like Disk 1, \\"Brawlers\\".  If you enjoy the haunting sadness of \\"Alice\\", you'll be pretty much resigned to Disk 2, \\"Bawlers\\" (actually a pretty nice collection there, in my humble opinion, if a lot sad).  And if you are hardcore enough to have enjoyed the aforementioned \\"Real Gone\\", well, Disk 3's \\"Bastards\\" is right up your alley.  Yes, listen to Tom Waits scream the story of King Kong set to mouth noise.  Or discover spoken facts about various insects.  Or tell a very long joke that I first told in 6th grade.  If you can find long-term enjoyment from \\"songs\\" like these, hey, grab your meds, stay off the streets, and settle down for a long winter's listen.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Thanks in large part to very fine performances by the three leads, `The Illusionist' stands apart from most films released in the early part of the year as a true cinematic treat.  I had wanted to see this film upon it's release but was unable due to the fact that it was released in very few theaters and only for a short time (at least in my area) but I was able to find it in stock at my local video store last night and was immediately spellbound by the direction this movie took.  I'm tempted to say that this was even more intoxicating than `The Prestige', but I'm yet to make up my mind.<br /><br />Telling the story of undying love set in Vienna as renowned illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is reunited with his long lost love Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel), `The Illusionist' does a brilliant job of building character and delivering enough twists and turns to keep you intrigued.  Eisenheim grew up the son of a carpenter, poor and banned from seeing his love Sophie.  He leaves town and swears to come back for her, but they are not reunited until 15-years later when she is promised to marry the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) a man known not only for his ideas of ruining a nation and overthrowing his fathers rule but also for his hot temper towards the women in his life.<br /><br />After their chance meeting both Eisenheim and Sophie devise a plan to be together but their plan is quickly being ruined by Leopold and his Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who is hot on their tail every step of the way.  When Sophie turns up dead it seems as if their plan has been stopped, but now a more pressing task is at hand, trying to find her killer.  In a game of wits Eisenheim and Uhl expertly combat one another and bring so much life to this film it's almost impossible not to become entranced.<br /><br />Edward Norton has always been one of my favorite actors, and here is no exception as he embraces his role and commands his performance, but he's upstaged every time by Paul Giamatti who just dominates every scene.  Just watch them interact at the restaurant, sitting across from one another and conversing, it's flawless, intimidating and utterly captivating.  Take a close look at two masters of their profession delivering the goods.  Jessica Biel must also be singled out for the maturity she brings to her character.  She has truly grown up since `7th Heaven' and deserves all the praise and even accolades she's received because of this, and Rufus Sewell is equally impressive as the oppressive and unlikable Leopold.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, like an old painting, and splendidly brought to life by a talented cast (just listen to the accents, not one of them seems forced or out of place...a true testament to their strength as actors), `The Illusionist' is more than likely one of the finest films of the past year and deserves our utmost attention.  I feel strongly that had this film been released in November or early December it would have made a strong showing in the Oscar race for from the script to the acting to the directing to the strength of the picture itself it truly is a fantastic experience.

B000009QPG|3.0|Technically these songs are near perfect for the genre. The guitar and drums are phenomenal. The album is a masterpiece. Having said that, the music just doesn't move me. Unlike Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Metallica etc, which made me \\"feel\\". Slayer may be a near perfect metal band, but it lacks the magic and soul to make it truly noteworthy. Every song is nearly the same. Very little creativity is mixed with the obvious technical expertise. It's diffucult to appreciate the scenery when the car is always going a hundred miles per hour.

B0000019PA|5.0|Wow.  Wow!  What an incredible album!  I was given this CD by my son, who knew I had finally gotten used to Colin Meloy's quirky, nasal, yet oddly winsome voice, so Jeff Mangum was no problem.  I was nearly in tears by the end of the first song.  The lyrics are heart-rending, the music is catchy and sad and uplifting and weird and, well, just plain awesome.  Plus, how can you not love a band that manages to make even bagpipes (or Uilleann pipes, or whatever the hell they are) sound fetching?  It was love at first listen, and that only happens to me about once a year.  Definitely not mainstream music, and I mean that in the very best way.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|You know, this is one of those movies that had every reason to suck.  I only went to see it because there was nothing else showing.  But I have to say that it surprised me.  Sure it's a silly movie with absurdly beautiful people everywhere.  Still, if you like this genre you might check it out.  It's not nearly as lame as it could have been.  Renny Harlin is hit or miss but he delivered a lot of movie on a pretty thin premise.

B000FA57N0|4.0|My gf and I watched the Firefly series and really loved the characters. It took me a bit to warm up to new actors like Nathan Fillion and Morena Baccarin but they aquitted themselves nicely.  I'm saddened that the show did not survive Fox's budget cuts but I'm so glad they were able to make this movie. None of the actors disappoint. The only part is that the interplay between the actors is limited as this is a 2hr movie and not a series but in the end the chemistry is there in this movie.  You don't have to watch the Firefly series but it certainly helps.<br /><br />Chiwetal Ejiofor is a nice newcomer here and plays a nice villian. I like to see the range this actor has. The HD DVD version looks fantastic it's surely going to be a show off disc for many of you. Enjoy
006085880X|5.0|Two families were the closest of friends.  Their children, Christopher Harte and Emily Gold, both age 17, had grown up together and started dating each other at age 13.  On one fateful night, that all changed when Emily is found dead from a gunshot wound and Chris claims it was a suicide pact.  The prosecutor claims murder and now these two supposedly ideal families will be ripped apart as they grapple with what happened and why. <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult's powerful story will leave the reader reeling from the overwhelming emotions conveyed.  Ms. Picoult demonstrates a solid grasp of her subject matter as her characters struggle with the notion of Emily's suicide versus Chris being her murderer.  THE PACT: A LOVE STORY is thought provoking, albeit painful at times. <br /> <br />     Jodi Picoult deftly interweaves the past and present in this poignant family drama.  Suicide is an extremely sensitive subject and this topic may disturb some readers.  Ms. Picoult handles the topic exceptionally well, however, remaining sensitive to all of the issues and parties involved in THE PACT: A LOVE STORY. <br /> <br />     THE PACT: A LOVE STORY is not an easy read, but it is a book well worth reading more for the questions Ms. Picoult asks than for any real answers.  As the story unfolds, readers will find themselves completely immersed into this deeply moving and heart wrenching tale.  THE PACT: A LOVE STORY is a very realistic portrayal of the aftermath of a suicide, particularly one under such questionable circumstances, and as such will be both loved and hated at the same time.  Kudos to Ms. Picoult for daring to venture into this territory and for being so compassionate in the process. <br /> <br />COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game showed up on the required reading list for 9th grade and my daughter passed over it several times, opting for other selections instead.  Near summer's end, several friends had read it, and loved it, so we dove in.  My whole family has read it and we all loved it.  While it is science fiction, it is a believable story about a little boy with exceptional abilities.  He remains real and believable even while enduring gruesome training.  The ending is also bittersweet (even though mom was the only one with tissues!) and led us all to pursue the next volumes in the series.  A good read for all.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is one of those rare movies that combine the best actors/actresses in the business with an amazing director. Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando & Elia Kazan.<br /><br />The whole cast deliver the performances of their career's and Kazan shows why he is a genius in the field of direction. This movie swept the Oscar's, winning 3/4 of the acting awards. The only loser was Marlon Brando, who lost to a screen legend at the top of his game, Humphrey Bogart.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the stunning cast. Vivien Leigh plays Blanche in probably the greatest performance in the history of cinema. Kim Hunter is simply breathtaking as Stella and Brando is stunning as Stanley.<br /><br />The actors here do a great job in bringing a sense of sincerity to their chracters that lacks in most movies today.<br /><br />Shot to amazing effect in black and white this adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic stage play is directed by the amazing Elia Kazan (\\"On The Waterfront\\", \\"Gentlemans Agreement\\"). These stellar combinations make this film essentially a classic and basically perfect.<br /><br />You can't help but feel sorry for poor Blanche, sympathise with Stella, laugh at the escapades of Eunice and detest the evil soul that is Stanley.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|With their impressive new LP \\"Light Grenades,\\" the boys of Incubus continue to let their sound evolve - a rarity for rock artists in the current musical landscape. Their first collection to notch the pole position of the Billboard albums chart, it finds them in several comfortable zones of expression and experimentation. Unfocused though it may be, its lack of coherence is more than justified by the impressive results. No one ever scored points for resting on their laurels.<br /><br />Wisely avoiding the clich&eacute;d trappings of concocted sadness and angst, lead singer Brandon Boyd carries each song home as convincingly as passionately. They don't rock as hard as they did on other albums like 2003's mighty \\"A Crow Left of the Murder,\\" but their music retains its quality. Songs like the politically conscious \\"Rogues\\" and the title track, for example, are downright effusive and mercurial with thrashing guitars, haphazard lyrics and unpredictable vocal gymnastics.<br /><br />Furthermore, the gloomy ambiguity of \\"Quicksand\\" finds Boyd tortured by his indecisiveness in love before transitioning into the thunderous \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off,\\" with further political commentary implicit in its bitter lyrics. \\"Paper Shoes\\" and \\"Pendulous Threads\\" also beckon repeated listens.<br /><br />Interestingly, the more obviously radio-ready rockers fit ideally into the context of the disc. \\"Anna Molly\\" and \\"Dig,\\" both singles, are more pointedly mainstream than anything they have recorded. They have all the quality that the already initiated expect, but contain strong hooks that can reel even the most casual listeners in. The latter track in particular would likely sound pass&eacute; in the hands of other vocalists, but Boyd infects the song with just the right amount of conviction to keep it from going astray.<br /><br />This trend of more mainstream material is spotlighted by the most impressive trio on the disc. \\"Love Hurts,\\" with its infectious yet understated melody and touching lyrics, is everything a good pop song should be. Wisely observing that \\"love hurts, but sometimes it's a good hurt\\" while still contemplating innocence (\\"I don't want to lose what I had as a boy\\") and the vulnerability that comes with being in love, it strikes just the right balance of romance, pathos and practicality.<br /><br />Meanwhile, \\"Oil and Water\\" and \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" wade through the predicaments of relationships, sounding fresh on account of their self-assured optimism. The latter in particular seems a destined hit, finding Boyd crooning \\"hey now, in spite of this we're doing just fine, even diamonds start as coal.\\"<br /><br />With \\"Light Grenades\\" Incubus has delivered a record not only for fans but for music lovers in general to enjoy. They may be an unpredictable bunch, but these guys know what works, and their music benefits for it.rics, is everything a good pop song should be.

B000E1155E|4.0|If it doesn't quite live up to NME's hype, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not is certainly the most promising UK debut in some time. Arctic Monkeys churns out a series of bratty punk narratives with enough lyrical detail and rhythmic swagger to overcome the essential shallowness of their subject matter. Life's not all dancefloors hookups and alcohol. Vocalist Alex Turner has a fine eye for the physical details of everyday life and impressive intuitive vocal cadence but he doesn't yet have the songwriting maturity to yet make these details meaningful. Excepting the odd and fairly unnecessary guitar solo, every instrument is a rhythm instrument. The band is more about groove than melody, which is just fine when your drummer clatters as well as Matt Helders. <br /> <br />The songs themselves are manic and overflowing with piled on lyrical flow, but in the record's relentlessness lies much of its charm. \\"The View From the Afternoon\\" leads the album with a percussive din that gives way to some jagged starts and stops, a nice contrast to the straightforward anthemic chorus. Most songs are structured around major shifts in rhythmic feel, the best of which, \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,\\" moves from light danceable verses to a blazingly simple chorus with confidence and gusto. Sequencing is a bit of a problem here, as six high-energy tracks pass before the first hint of a respite in \\"Riot Van,\\" a muted tale of underage drinking that is among the structurally weakest cuts on the record. Fortunately, the second half of the album is uniformly excellent, excepting the clunky \\"Perhaps Vampires is a Bit Strong But...\\" \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" and \\"A Certain Romance\\" contend for best second half cut and all the most fully realized songs on the album, though not the most instantly gripping.  <br /> <br />Though certainly imperfect, this is a fine debut from a modest band certain to continue making energetic, visceral rock.
B000005JA8|5.0|I cant think of any other way to describe Trout Mask Replica, than saying that it is anarchy in a record sleeve. The most bizzare, obsure, dark, raw, and trippy album ever devised. The music swerves back and forth through time signatures as if they were nothing at all. All the instruments sound untuned and the bassist is playing something comepletly different than the rest of the band. Over top of all this, Captain Beefheart rambles on over the microphone in a low and gritty Howlin Wolf style register. Its hard to belive that the great Captain Beefheart had previously composed all the parts to this symphony of chaos. One of the best songs on the album is got to be Moonlight on Vermont. This song opens up with one of the greatest drumlines in history. It sounds as if the snare is sprimg activated. The lyrics are beautiful surreal poetry. Zoot horn Rollo plays the slide as if he were a recovering morphine addict. If your musical taste are tepid, and you cant tolerate captain Beefheart, than this is not for you. The album is a classic piece of Dada art. WARNING: Its not easy listening!
0060574216|1.0|This book does not offer any supported or relevant information for intimate partners. The driving idea of men and women being essentially from different cultures and having completely different communication styles is unsupported by the vast majority of professionals in the fields of psychology and counseling and it is not supported by even ONE reseach study.

Head First has a great way of ensuring that you are paying attention to the content and understand it via exercises, puzzles and code completions.  <br /> <br />I like to say that Head First books, especially this particular book, is more like a novel. There seems to be a story evolving and it keeps your attention. <br /> <br />The only issue with the Design Patterns book, and they mention this in the book, if you haven't already been introduced to patterns you will have the tendency to want to implement most of the patterns presented in your next project.

B00005JMCN|5.0|No review can do justice to this movie and the amazing story of the relationships of everyone involved with this horse. I was able to read the book by Laura Hillenbrand prior to viewing the movie. The book was lengthy and very detailed, but an excellent job was done to condense it into such a great movie. There could not have been a better cast of actors to portray each character of the book, nor could there have been a better production staff for the film.  While watching this movie, it is difficult, (if not impossible), not to get enthralled in the emotion and excitement of the lives of each individual in the story.  And I must say that having a good tv sound system added another super-dimension to viewing this, as the movie's sound and sound editing were excellent.  I recommend \\"Seabiscuit\\" not just as a film about a horse, but also as a film about determination, devotion, and unexpected miracles that can occur in life, especially during one of the toughest times in American history.

B000069KGM|5.0|early chicago at its best!!!!  this is raw, intense, and the drumwork on the tracks is wonderful and aggressive.  i just wished that they would've kept this sound even in the 80s.  really, i wonder what the music would've been like if terry kath hadn't have died the way he did.  THE WHOLE WORLD'S WATCHINH............THE WHOLE WORLD'S WATCHING.........that has been sampled so many times that it is not even funny.  like their version of I'M A MAN just as much........if not more.............than the spencer davis group.  love that PURPLES song.  BEGINNINGS and SATURDAY IN THE PARK are oldies station staples.  for me, though, it's COLOUR MY LOVE.  that da da da DA da da..............i am a straight gullysucka for that!!!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie startles you with the facts of how bad things are, and makes you disappointed in the stubbornness and self serving attitude of the government.  We already know they protect the big oil companies, but this shows how appallingly ignorant they choose to be.
B000002OX7|5.0|Between commercials, use in TV and film and stale (classic) rock stations, most people would recognize many of these songs, even if they didn't know them outright.  The songs are well written and performed beautifully.  Despite their age, they still sound fresh.  A fine effort.  If you were going to have a collection of the best rock albums/cds of all time, this would certainly be on the list.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|I felt that this movie was worth seeing as I hadn't read the book until recently.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the rapidity of the action.  It needed to be slowed down a bit and I believe parts of the book were either left out or not elaborated on.  All in all I'll watch it again and maybe I'll catch something I missed.
B000002N2N|5.0|Many of the other reviews have been more succinct or full of the accurate glowing praise.  I want to be careful with my use of platitudes.  If you don't get the Ramones, this won't necessarily change your mind.  BUT, if you like the Ramones or have ever been to one of their concerts, you know what I mean.  The energy is palpable and intense.  Listening to this set reminds me of the 3 concerts I was lucky to witness.  If you are a fan of the band and never got to experience a show (you have my pity), this is as close as you can ever get.  Growing up I heard that Grateful Dead shows were the live shows to experience.  While I thoroughly appreciated my one and only dead experience, I would have to differ.  Ramones concerts were like a combination of a religious experience and sex, all at the same time.  The set, despite being around 30 years old has aged beautifully.  Don't forget to turn your amplifier up.  Enjoy.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne in the movie version of Robert Ludlum's epic book series and delivers more than a viewer can ask for.  This action packed, edge of your seat suspense and drama will entertain every viewer.  If you crave unending action combined with suspense and drama, this movie is for you.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have only seen the English voice over version, so there are probably differences between it and the Japanese version, but hey, you go with what you've got.  Interesting story, fascinating characters, beautiful imagery.  You could probably watch the movie a dozen times and still continue to see new things.  I find this to be consistent with all of the Miyazaki movies.   This movie, like all great movies that you might have an affinity for can draw you in at anytime - by this I mean that you could pass by it in the middle and suddenly find yourself glued to the couch until it is over. <br /> <br />You can get get the plot details, etc. from the other reviewers.  Suffice it to say that this is a rich, well crafted movie that will reward you for spending the time.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Taylor Hackford's \\"White Nights\\" is definitely one of my favorite movies ever. I signed up like two years ago to be notified of the release of this movie on DVD and bought it right away when it became available on Amazon. Nikolai Rodchenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov) is a young and somewhat spoiled Russian ballet legend whose multiple successes in his motherland couldn't match his need for freedom and a life outside the unbearable perennial watch of the Soviet communist regime. So he chooses to defect to the United States where he becomes a major celebrity at the height of the Cold War tensions between the two countries. When traveling from London to Tokyo for a series of presentations, Rodchenko's plane malfunctions and is forced to perform an emergency landing on Russian soil. Nikolai will eventually be caught by the KGB and taken secretly back to Leningrad despite protests from the West. Being as he is, a glory of the Russian ballet, Rodchenko is forced to stay in the URSS and to resume his life as usual. He is put under strict surveillance by the KGB and assigned an accompanying couple, the Greenwood's, who are supposed to inform Rodchenko's whereabouts 24/7 to the soviet intelligence. Raymond Greenwood (Gregory Hines) is an African American tap dancer who tired of living a life of struggle for social and economic betterment in the U.S., voluntarily chose to very publicly \\"defect\\" to the URSS in opposition to the War in Vietnam. However flashy his \\"defection\\" was -and utterly publicized by the Russians- years have passed and Raymond is now just limited to small performances in little towns around Siberia, still living the life of an underprivileged man, but in the URSS. He married Darya (Isabella Rossellini), a Russian girl who loves him adoringly but who also, to much of her dismay, sometimes cannot hold up against Raymond's frustrations and personal demons. Interaction between Nikolai and Raymond becomes the main subject of the film and Nikolai will make Raymond realize how limited and hopeless life is in the URSS and eventually the three of them will seek a way to return to the United States. The film shows beautiful moving scenes such as the one where a drunk Raymond opens himself up to Nilokai in a heartfelt tap-dance-backed-up monologue, giving an impressively moving and honest performance. It shocks me everytime I watch it. Or my other favorite dancing scene, where Nilokai meets his former lover Galina Ivanova (Helen Mirren) at the stage of the Kirov Theater. Galina has now become a prominent figure of the Soviet Ballet nomenklatur. Together they will reminish about past love and life, and dancing to the passionate lyrics of Vladimir Vysotsky a famous Russian protest poet-singer, Nikolai will desperately and hopelessly try to explain her (and perhaps once more, also to himself) why he had to leave his whole life behind. In the process, he will also try to ease the inner pain of longing for his roots, history and identity. Dancing sequences performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines (both solos and as an ensemble) are incredibly moving and beautiful. Choreographies are Baryshnikov's, Hines's and even there is an incredibly moving opening segment choreographed by Twayla Tharp \\"The young man and the death\\" performed by Baryshnikov himself and Florence Faure who will leave you speechless. The music is great (I particularly remember the sticky rhythmic beat of \\"My love is chemical\\" by Lou Reed). Despite the obvious age that the picture shows \\"White Nights\\" is a beautiful movie, with spectacular dancing sequences, definitely worth watching. Personally to me it is certainly a pity that the whole story is still as appealing as it was twenty years ago. Forced migration was certainly an issue back then in 1985 as it continues to be today. Still in 2007 there are people who are virtually obligated to migrate from their own countries when civil liberties are not in force or about to perish. Just turn your head and watch the horrific example of Cuban \\"balseros\\", people who prefer to risk their lives in shark-infected waters seeking the coast of Florida instead of living a freedomless life of craving and need under the communist regime of Fidel Castro. So yes, in a time of a suppousedly \\"end of ideologies\\", \\"White Nights\\" is a movie that has a well established political posture and yet is also undeniably interesting and moving to watch and enjoy time and time again.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|Belinda Carlisle's 7th studio album, \\"Voila!\\", makes it's stateside debut  on 2/6/07. Get this... it's sung completely in French. This album is fanfreakingtastic.  I can only guess at the accuracy of Belinda's pronunciation but it doesn't matter here. Whatever she is singing about is brimming with emotion and conviction. The album has an essentially pop feel to it but there is a nice diversity of music here. It has a very honest, earthy feel tinged with electronic modernity. Listening to this must certainly be the modern day equivalent of watching a Godard film during the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> The team, which includes John Reynolds as Producer, and Brian Eno, Natacha Atlas, and Sharon Shannon as session artists, et al, has infused East Indian sounds into the western melodies creating a beautiful, trance-like quality; most evident on \\"Ma Jeunesse Fout Le Camp\\" <br /> <br /> How do you credibly remake \\"La Vie En Rose\\"?  Give it a beatnik inspired bongo beat, layer Belinda's stadium quality vocals on the chorus, revisit the transcendental East Indian warble and make what had better be marketed as the next big club hit! I dare you not to have visions of Grace Kelly in her convertible gliding through Monte Carlo as thousands of doves swarm the twilight skies when you listen to this. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what's happening to the poor girl in \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\" but it's powerful. If her man doesn't have roses in his hand when he comes home- he'd better stay gone. Belinda has gone beyond singing pop music and entered musical storytelling. Forget tracing a \\"Circle in the Sand\\". Drive your Citroen off that \\"Emotional Highway\\". These are real feelings, raw and visceral resonations.  <br /> <br /> Don't let the soft opening fool you, \\"Des Ronds Dans L'eau\\" is catchy, funky, and beautiful. Of special note are the very French feeling accordion, the pulsing synth sound evoking a bubble machine and, of course, the interesting juxtaposition of Belinda's vocalssnapping from a sense of resignation to dictator-like zeal. (The guitar strums in the opening sound remarkably like the opening to her last single, \\"All God's Children\\".) <br /> <br /> Tilt my beret and butter my croissant! \\"Sous Le Ciel De Paris\\" couldn't be more French. Belinda's \\"mmm hmmms\\" have a certain je ne se quoi (did I spell that right?) that smacks of artsy fartsy, Foucault inspired, intellectual elitism. Kudos to whoever thought up the Les Miserable chorus- Vive La Revolution!  The chanting legion is brilliantly place over a backdrop of a mysterious and uniquely French sounding \\"circus on the moon\\" style rhythms. <br /> <br /> \\"Jezebel\\" sounds like a stagecoach robbery would feel. If you aren't sweating after hearing this, you aren't human. There are amazing Spanish guitars on this number. Do I hear that French accordion again? An inspired blend- seriously. The gunshot evoking \\"clap clap clap\\" adds drama and, of course, Belinda is storytelling again. There is massive energy coming from her voice. You can feel the frenzy in her last \\"Jez- ah- bel-l-l-l\\" which leaves her spent as the last breath leaves her throat. <br /> <br /> \\"Merci Cherie\\" is beautiful, emotional and well executed. Of particular note is the snare drum. Dropped over that fabulous accordion it brings an emotional resolve to the song that serves it well. <br /> <br /> Remember Audrey Hepburn contorting her body to the hip beatnik rhythms in \\"Funny Face\\"? Funk that up with a shiny, silver, skin-tight spacesuit and hang out with Carlos Castaneda to truly understand \\"Contact\\". What a cool song. No idea what the original was like but this spacey, echoy, dusty vinyl sound with click track is very catchy. <br /> <br /> \\"Pourtant Tu M'aimes\\" is a sort of  'best of the rest'. All the great parts of the other songs come together here with a syncopated beat. It opens with a groovy, minimalist interpretation of contstructivist factory sounds and becomes a fully produced, rock styled pop song. This may offend some, but... This is the most Go-Go's friendly track. Not that there has to be one, but can't you just hear Jane in the background; Kathy grinding that bass. Charlotte gets to pull out the keyboard (can she play the accordion?) and Gina could drive the hell out of this number in place of the click track. Do it y'all! <br /> <br /> \\"Avec Le Temps\\" is a dream. It's lilting and spiritual. The strings and xylophone provide an ethereal backdrop, which ebbs and swells creating a gentle passage of time hinting at eternity but ultimately hindered by mortality. The squishy echoes help deepen the space and, with the right sound system, would make a very cool planetarium experience. Belinda, were you crying when you sang this? **sniff** I bet you were. <br /> <br /> \\"Bonnie Et Clyde\\"! What fresh Bel(inda) this is! This is another example of Belinda's obvious work paying off. I imagine there is a bit of credit due to John Reynolds here too, but listen to her opening script- She pulls the listener in as a unique blend of sex kitten and master of ceremonies. Don't quite understand the jungle sounds in the background but they work. Guess it's part of the East Indian thing- love it. Everyone say it with me- \\"Bah-knee and Cly-y-deh\\" <br />Very Belinda, that delivery. <br /> <br />Vive \\"Voila!\\" ;)
B000F48CD8|5.0|This album is fantastic!  It blends the talent of what Jack White brings to the White Stripes and expands it by blending with the talents of a full band.  I like to think of myself as somewhat distinguishing when it comes to music.   If you are a Rock, or Alt Rock fan, and you haven't listened to this album, give it a shot.  I listen to every song on the album, this is not one where you listen to one or two songs and regret wasting the money on a full album when you could have just gotten the two they play on the radio. <br /> <br />My only disappointment with the album is that its too short.  It leaves me wanting more.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I had always thought that Incubus was okay, but that all their songs tended to sound the same. I heard 'Anna Molly' on the radio and was surprised to learn that it was Incubus.  Sounds like the singer's been listening to a little Mars Volta (whose songs I either love or hate - but who's talent I always admire) and is stretching himself - I like it and he's quite capable.<br /><br />This CD has both hard songs and a few ballads.  There are a lot of cool noisy effects digressions, great drums and powerful, free-form vocals.  A few of the songs are radio-type songs, but not all and that's okay.<br /><br />So, I bought the CD and whatdoyaknow?  It's a darn good one with vocal and musical variety.  Of course long-time fans aren't going to like it - it doesn't sound like all the other stuff they've done.  But, if like me you always thought that it was an alright band but not one that you'd go out of your way for, check out this album - 'cause it's a little different.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|`Saw III' directed by Darren Lynn Bousman is cut from the same cookie cutter script as the previous two movies, without the novelty of the first, but with just a scant improvement in plot over the second. The `Saw' series is the exemplar for an entire new genre of horror movie which can to some extent trace its roots back to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. While these have been criticized as being nothing more than exercizes in blood and Sadism, I really find them big improvements over the very tired plotlines arrising out of the Halloween model which has been done to death a at least 13 times over and more. The basic premise replaces the naïve teenager oblivious to the danger lurking behind him, with a fully aware victim in imminant peril that they fully appreciate, and which is drawn out with building expectation rather than diving in with a quick kill. Thus, in spite of all the gore and paraphenalia, there is much more psychological terror and vicarious fear being dished out here than by most appearences by Freddy or Jason or whomever.<br /><br />The other side of the coin is the realization of how bare these movies are of new ideas. The whole premise of the first movie was culled from a three minute scene from `The Road Warrior'. And that was the best of the three movies. One of the opening `trap' scenes in this movie was taken from a similarly short scene in the first `Hellraiser' movie. The voice-over commentary from the director and producers make great exclamation on how well things are executed in this movie, totally ignoring the fact that the story line is radically disconnected and the behavior of the characters is improbable at best.<br /><br />There is much to the criticism of this sub-genre of horror movie, and the criticism would lead to believing that the films had no value whatsoever, except that nobody else is doing the `Perils of Pauline' sthick at all, let alone well. That said, I will say that the `traps', that is, `the good parts' in this movie, are just a bit better than `the good parts' in `Saw I' and `Saw II'.ovie, are just a bit better than `the good parts' in `Saw I' and `Saw II'. <br />
006112429X|5.0|Between the dark and the daylight, <br />When night is beginning to lower, <br />Comes a pause in the day's occupations, <br />That is known as the children's hour. <br /> <br />A whisper and then a silence, <br />Yet I know by their merry eyes <br />They are plotting and planning together <br />To take me by surprise. <br /> <br />-Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \\"The Children's Hour\\" <br /> <br />School shooters were the menace of the late `90s, holding adults in their sweaty little grip for nearly a decade.  In 1996, a teacher and two students were killed in Moses Lake, Washington.  In 1997, a thirteen-year-old student shot a classmate over $40.  That same year, Evan Ramsey killed a student and the principal of his school in Bethel, Alaska; Luke Woodham killed three classmates, wounded seven, and stabbed his mother to death in Pearl, Mississippi; and 14-year-old Michael Carneal shot up a Paducah, Kentucky school prayer group, killing three.   <br /> <br />In 1998, the juvenile shooters became more brazen.  That spring, a 13-year-old partnered with an 11-year-old in Jonesboro, Arkansas to kill five and wound ten.  A month later, Andrew Wurst killed a teacher in Edinboro, Pennsylvania and, in Springfield, Oregon, Kip Kinkel upped the ante by murdering his parents as well.  The epidemic seemed to culminate in 1999, when 12 were killed and 24 injured at Columbine High School in suburban Denver.   <br /> <br />The counter-epidemic was no less predictable and no less morosely enthralling as the country scrambled frantically to understand why.  In the wake of the Columbine murders, the victims' families filed lawsuits against the police, the school district, AOL Time Warner, Palm Pictures, Sony Entertainment, and the parents of the perpetrators.   <br /> <br />Blame for the murders was widely scattered and carelessly aimed.  Video games, movies, rock music, godlessness, gun control, and working mothers were all discarded before cliques and adolescent bullying were uneasilyadopted to explain this spate of children spinning violently out of control. <br /> <br />In 2003 (still two years before 16-year-old Jeffrey Weise would kill seven people in Red Lake, Minnesota), Lionel Shriver tackled the question fictitiously in We Need to Talk About Kevin (Perseus Books).  In a series of letters to her husband, Eva Khatchadourian sorts through her son's childhood and her own reluctance about motherhood in an effort to understand what drove Kevin to murder nine of his classmates on the eve of his 16th birthday.  <br /> <br />Granted, the epistolary artifice is forced and Shriver (who proudly describes herself as a pedant) is a verbal show-off, telling the story in languorous, unnecessarily complex sentences.  But Kevin is still a brilliant tragicomic satire of child-centered families in the `90s, raising the possibility that we're allowing these little beasts to run wild in the name of building their \\"self-esteem.\\" <br /> <br />Eva is a casualty of child-centeredness.  She reluctantly scales back her career in publishing travel guides to have a child she isn't sure she wants and, from birth, she ascribes malicious intent and intractable motives to Kevin's behavior.  She's impatient, sharp-tongued, and has little use for the mawkishly sentimental notions of ideal maternity. <br /> <br />Shriver obviously expects us to ask whether Kevin's problems are all his mother's fault and we can never quite ascertain Eva's credibility.  She admits she was a terrible mother, but even this conclusion is suspect as she inflates the mother-son relationship to unreasonable proportions (which she acknowledges as a form of vanity). <br /> <br />But it's hard to avoid the possibility that child-centeredness has as much to do with Kevin's murderous tendencies as Eva's chilly reception of motherhood.  At its core is the belief that children, due to an assumed psychological fragility, are utterly shaped by their parents and therefore \\"good parenting\\" means the mother must subsume her entire identity in her children.  What's more, she must enjoy every moment of this for, if she does not, the child will sense her ambivalence and be warped by it. <br /> <br />One earmark of child-centeredness is over-indulgence and lack of discipline.  If children do something bad, it's assumed to be the fault of the parents (primarily the mother and usually because she is, in some way, selfishly indulging herself). <br /> <br />Another related earmark is a preoccupation with the child's psyche and self-image.  The theory goes that, because children are entirely shaped by their parents, they are assumed to be a tabula rasa and intrinsically good.  Anything the mother does (particularly any selfish desires or less-than-enthusiastic attitudes) can mar this perfect slate, resulting in bad behavior and mental illness. <br /> <br />There's an historical myopia to these steep and immutable maternal expectations.  They fail to acknowledge that parenting and childhood are culturally-defined and that beliefs about child-rearing change drastically across time and place. To even come close to meeting child-centered expectations requires a certain amount of wealth and leisure.  Before modern conveniences made this possible, no parent would have had the time or disposable wealth to focus this much energy on parenting as a task in itself -- there was too much farming, weaving, hunting, ranching, and domestic labor to be done.  Yet somehow society managed to progress anyhow. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, most readers will cheerfully collaborate in blaming Eva and few blame Kevin's father, Franklin, who sees only good in his son and undermines any attempt to discipline him, placing a wedge of marital discord between the parents.  Kevin is coddled and over-indulged by a father who becomes so invested in the kind of son he wants that he fails to see the son he actually has. Kevin can get away with anything and has no respect for Franklin from the beginning. <br /> <br />That readers sympathize so readily with Franklin underscores the expectation that mothers will give everything while fathers will get a free pass no matter how inept or uninvolved they may be.  Can a failure to discipline truly be considered superior parenting to a failure to indulge?   Even if we accept that Kevin was born a tabula rasa and would have been ok if he'd been born to different parents, wouldn't a failure to see his flaws have been at least as influential as Eva's reluctance to have him in the first place? <br /> <br />There is arguably the strongest textual evidence that Kevin has an organic mental illness and has been a sociopath from birth.  And, on this score, Shriver has obviously done her homework.  He presents a lot of the vague sort of symptoms that correlate with sociopathy, but which can't be taken as conclusive proof of it: constant crying in infancy, an unusually large head and lack of muscle tone (as a child, pediatricians describe Kevin as \\"floppy\\"), an unusual acceptance of boredom, a tendency to \\"zone out\\" (eyes glazed over and mouth hanging open), extreme difficulty with toilet training, and an alarming lack of empathy. <br /> <br />It's hard to read this book and not give in to the temptation to settle on one or two particular answers. But part of the tragedy of the Kevins of the world is that they have no meaning.  There's no way to make them safe and pocket-sized and controllable without being, to some degree, dishonest about them.  <br /> <br />What drove Kevin off the deep end may be the most obvious question posed by the novel, but it's also the most banal, ultimately resolved only through a leap of blind reader hubris.  We close the book with no more certainty about what causes school shootings than when we picked it up - and author interviews suggest this was probably the point.  We grapple for The Answer out of the same vanity exhibited by Eva - the need of the privileged to find order in the universe and use that order to wardoff disaster.  If there is no definitive answer, then any parent is capable of producing a monster.  <br /> <br />Besides, there are much more interesting questions posed by Shriver's keen insights into American culture and our nihilistic little hearts. <br /> <br />Kevin sees a kindred spirit in his mother because Eva is able to peek into the same black void of meaninglessness that makes Kevin's life so intolerable, but which everyone else around them ignores.  Kevin looks to Eva to guide him through this Nietzschean Hell that he holds in such contempt.  And herein lies Eva's failure - much greater than not being nice and feminine and maternal:  she was never able to give Kevin's life meaning for him.   <br /> <br />If we accept at face value that Eva's problem is a failure to be instinctively maternal, we risk ignoring her much greater character flaws that would have been no less flaws had she never decided to reproduce.  If anyone around Kevin could have convinced him that life has meaning, it would probably have been Eva.  She's the only one who would have given him an answer that wasn't coated in dishonesty and foolishness.  Instead, she tells him that the cure to existential boredom is to \\"bring a book.\\" <br /> <br />Eva and Franklin wanted a child in order to answer what they called the \\"Big Question\\" - the purpose of human existence - which Eva later realizes may be the most selfish part of their reasoning.  They can't give Kevin's life any meaning because they had kids as a way to give their own lives meaning. <br /> <br />It's a question that's never before been raised in the whole course of human history.  Children used to be essential because they were needed for labor.  Now that the First World no longer needs children economically, it's become a viable question:  Do I want children and, if so, why? <br /> <br />It's a question that's needled American readers and given Lionel Shriver the reputation of an ice queen.  Shriver (who changed her name from \\"Margaret Ann\\" to \\"Lionel\\" at age 15) is an American expatriate living in London whose mixed feelings about the United States may shine through in Eva even more than her contempt for the soppiness and boredom of motherhood.  And she indulges these fierce American insights even with her characters. <br /> <br />Franklin, a hot dog-snarfing Republican patriot, is both the stereotypical American and the way we want to see ourselves. He embodies our national story and the way we cling, in the face of all evidence, to the insistence that the whole rest of the world sees us the same way we see ourselves -- reality need not apply.  In many ways, Franklin is a better person than anyone else in the novel, but his complete refusal to acknowledge reality is his undoing. <br /> <br />Eva, the daughter of Armenian immigrants, is also a sort of American cliche, but one that the Franklins like to minimize. She's the gadfly. She's the stereotypical East Coast liberal who idealizes Europe and Canada and rolls her eyes at all those ignorant rubes she's stuck sharing a country with. She believes she's smarter than they are and, though she's right, she's not a better person for it. Her honesty is unacceptable to the Franklins because it pierces the national story of American superiority and, ironically, it's her own honesty that makes her miserable. It enables her to not only see everything that unfolds for what it is, but to realize her own hand in making it that way. At least Franklin's ignorance is bliss. <br /> <br />Kevin is the dark side of American culture that nobody wants to talk about. Our meaninglessness. Our boredom. Our dissatisfaction with consumerism. We have everything, so what's left to take pleasure in except hedonistic sadism and destruction? Kevin is really the logical outcome of combining the Franklins and the Evas. <br /> <br />Even little Celia -- Kevin's small, timid, and self-effacing sister -- has a symbolic role to play. She's our other unmentionable dark side.Our fear and our sense of isolation. She's the reality that, for all America's international bravado, we're really so petrified of The Terrorists that we're quivering under the bed, peeing ourselves. And it's too bad she's unmentionable, because she's also our un-self-conscious innocence, our artless naivete, our incorruptible sweetness. <br /> <br />For all Shriver's evident frustrations with child-centeredness (\\"the same folks who are inclined to sue builders who did not perfectly protect them from the depredations of an earthquake [are] the first to claim that their son failed his math test because of attention deficit disorder and not because he spent the night before at a video arcade\\"), with therapy culture (\\"a complaint common enough to have a name...dangles options like Internet chat rooms and community support groups for rhapsodic communal bellyaching\\"), with cheap forgiveness (\\"conspicuous clemency has become the religious version of driving a flashy car\\"), or with exceptionalism (\\"Americans are...self-righteous and superior about their precious democracy, and condescending toward other nationalities because they think they've got it right - never mind that half the adult population doesn't vote...Worst of all, they have no idea that the rest of the world can't stand them.\\"), what really seems to stick in her craw is the American love of spectacle.  As Christopher Hitchens (whom I'm loath to quote, but in this instance, he's right) once said, \\"All Americans really want, deep down, is to be special.\\"    <br /> <br />So, was Kevin then responding to a dysfunctional society obsessed with fame by any means necessary?  For a short season, school shootings were a fad. They went from the distant, unrealistic fantasies of misfit kids to a quasi-legitimate form of adolescent self-expression. Adults fed the fad by speaking in darkly hopeful tones about how it could happen in their town too. It got a lot of attention and kids always do things that garner lots of adult attention. It didn't take kids long to figure out that shooting up their school would make them famous all over the country. <br /> <br />Shriver shrinks not from polemic when she has Kevin deliver the following speech to the TV cameras: \\"You wake up and you watch TV, and you get in the car and you listen to the radio.  You go to your little job or your little school, but you're not going to hear about that on the 6:00 news, since guess what.  Nothing is really happening...You watch TV all night or maybe you go out so you can watch a movie, and maybe you get a phone call so you can tell your friends what you've been watching...What are they watching?...People like me...you're listening to what I say because I have something you don't: I got plot.\\" [Italics original] <br /> <br />Perhaps it's poor form for an author to shame her readers in this way, but it's certainly effective.  We know going into it that Kevin shoots up his school and I was, true to form, gobbling the book up in anticipation of a gory climax. Just the same way millions of people sat glued to the television on the day of the Columbine murders. <br /> <br />Our insatiable appetite for disaster porn may serve the higher purpose of giving us someone to loathe.  Andrea Yates was once everyone's favorite mother to hate. We needed her so we could say, \\"Hey, I may not be perfect, but at least I'd never drown my five children in the bathtub.\\" Thereby drawing a clear, reassuring line between good mothers and bad mothers.  Yates externalized what is perhaps a common reluctance about having kids and a fear of snapping at some point and hurting them. Maybe so many people wanted to kill Andrea Yates in order to kill the part of themselves that feared they could identify with her. <br /> <br />Shriver herself provokes nearly as strong a reaction as Eva, apparently for the unfeminine crime of saying and doing whatever she pleases.  Shriver's cheerful admission that she finds children messy, loud, tiresome, and\\"brutally dull\\" has earned her a reputation as \\"anti-child,\\" implying that any woman who doesn't enjoy children is abnormal and suspicious.  She openly disdains American tackiness and spends as much time overseas as possible.  When she won the Orange Prize for Kevin in 2005, she was criticized for not displaying the proper humility.  The BBC ran a photo of her jubilantly kissing her award and she admitted that she not only very much wanted to win, but believed that she deserved to win. <br /> <br />It's this desire for iconoclasm that proves Eva - and her creator -  to be ironically and ineluctably, even lovably, as American as apple pie.
0312335164|3.0|Digital Fortress, written in the late 1990s before the computer revolution really got into full swing, is about a secret NSA (National Security Agency) computer called TRANSLTR that can break any code in existence. Made up of over 3 million processors, the supercomputer is as big as a small building and takes a city's worth of energy to keep running. But it's all worth it--TRANSLTR is the United States government's first and last line of defense in the digital age.<br /><br />When word hits the cyber-street about a new, supposedly unbreakable encryption technology, the NSA isn't too worried. After all, TRANSLTR has never yet met any code it couldn't crack. But fifteen hours into the decryption process, the computer has yet to find a solution algorithm, and suddenly the world looks very different in the face of potentially uncrackable correspondence between enemies of the state.<br /><br />Enter Susan Fletcher and David Becker. Susan is the NSA's top cryptographer. She's young, brilliant, and beautiful. She also happens to be TRANSLTR's creator and caretaker. David is a university language professor. He's young, dynamic, and Susan's lover. In a move thought at first to be strategic because it's unexpected, the deputy director of NSA sends David to Spain to retrieve a ring containing the unlock key for the new code from its dead creator. David is a civilian, so no one would expect him to be looking for the key. Susan is less than pleased that her boyfriend has been tagged for this mission. But soon things start to unravel around the NSA headquarters, and Susan has other matters to worry about.<br /><br />The story of Digital Fortress follows David around Spain in search of the elusive ring as Susan tries to sort through an ever-growing web of deceit back at home. Who wrote the unbreakable code, really? What was its original purpose? And who at the NSA might be involved? In Spain, everyone who has seen the ring begins to die, and David realizes that this might not the easy task he had been assured it would be. Can he find it in time to save the NSA's databanks from destruction? And can he stay alive in the process?<br /><br />Digital Fortress contains Dan Brown's trademark fast-paced action--the last several chapters are a real-time countdown as David and Susan literally race the clock to decipher the code in time--and shallow but likeable characters. The book contains far more sexual content than necessary, and there is a surprising amount of profanity. It's a fast, entertaining read, but unfortunately the central conspiracy falls apart toward the end, and the book has to finish solely on the merits of its suspense and not its intricacy--disappointing in light of Brown's later successes.<br /><br />With a light edit to remove some of the objectionable material and some additional thought given to the plausibility of the ending, Digital Fortress could have been a great book. In spite of its weaknesses, however, it's worth a look for fans of Dan Brown, who clearly has improved as an author during the past eight years.t the easy task he had been assured it would be.

0618680004|5.0|Theists are used to compromise from skeptics. The agnostic's credo, for example, typically ends with something like, \\" Well, no one knows for sure whether God exists or not. So you (theist) should be content with your realm (usually spiritual matters `unseen'), and I (agnostic) will be content with mine (usually the world of science).\\" Now, from a cultural standpoint, this separation into co-equal realms has brought about a spotty, if uneasy, truce in the 500 year old conflict between science and religion for supremacy. <br /> <br />Dawkins' book has caused a storm because he flat out refuses to compromise in areas where both believers and non-believers have come to expect it. Just as provocatively, he advances evolutionary-based explanations for topics typically regarded as religion's turf, e.g., morality, prayer, the origin of religion, and others. In short, he refuses to accept the terms of the truce, and, in that sense, goes on a secular attack against not only Christian fundamentalists (already inflamed by the massive inroads of Darwin's theory), but also against those compromisers who brought about the terms of the truce itself, namely agnostics (on the secular side) and non-literalist Christians (on the theist side). No wonder the Amazon response list is 500 and counting. <br /> <br />As an atheist, I want to remind readers of an avenue of attack on the Christian concept of divinity which Dawkins leaves unused. That is the disproof of God's existence from the reality of evil, (Argument from the Existence of Evil). Admittedly, tons of ink have been spilled by skeptics and apologists alike over this sensitive topic (theodicy). Dawkins himself makes no mention of it, probably for reasons of his own. Nonetheless, the dilemma of how a God perfect in every respect could create such a manifestly imperfect world continues to pose an embarrassing problematic to theologian and ordinary believer alike, and remains an ongoing source of popular skepticism.  <br /> <br />Now, in the spirit of Dawkins' evolution subtext, I would like to pose a question: Just what is the role animal life (non-human) is supposed to play in this \\"the best of all possible worlds\\". Evolution poses a clear natural world explanation. Can theology do the same for its theological premise. For example, why not a perfect divinity who creates a world without animals, thereby sparing them from adding monumentally to the amount of suffering in the world which I take to be instances of an evil. Why not, for one, a world of human vegetarians since slaughter-houses constitute a major source of animal pain? Or if plants are considered too sentient for consumption, why not human rock-eaters. Or if God is a hylozoist (all matter is in some sense 'alive'), why not a human species that  need not metabolize at all. The latter two may seem far-fetched. Nevertheless, the theologian must show why any or all are logically impossble for a God that is by definition all-powerful, all-knowing and morally perfect, and who cannot by these terms create anything less than the best of all possible worlds. <br /> <br />To this type of query theologians usually produce explanations amounting to either \\"It's a mystery\\" or the ubiquitous \\"It's all part of God's plan\\" or the equally ubiquitous \\"To bring about a greater good\\". The precariousness of such responses should be self-evident. Still and all, let's suppose for the sake of illustration that even to a perfect God, evolution is in some sense necessary such that animal life becomes a required feature of our world. Nonetheless, perplexing questions can still be posed, such as that pertaining to the pit viper (of India, I believe). Pity the poor creature who wanders into the the deep recesses of caves where these blind, heat-seeking serpents dwell. Scientists explain that once bitten, the victim dies one of the most painful deaths imaginable, alone and in the dark. My question is this: Why cannot the perfect God at least reduce the painfultoxicity of the venom by one minute degree, thereby reducing the degree of suffering if not the suffering itself. The response, unfortunately, is likely to be the same as before, because the theologian really has no other explanation. Compare the theologian's recourse here with the very real explanation that natural selection can provide for a venom's toxicity, keeping in mind that no evolutionist has ever had to hold that our animal world necessarily constitutes the best of all possible animal worlds. <br /> <br />Of course, apologists can dismiss our concern with animal suffering as of no moral significance since animals, unlike our privileged selves, have no `soul'. Or they can deny them value on the basis that God gave us \\"domain\\" over them. I suspect there is less of that opinion around now than in days gone by-- at least, I hope so. On the other hand, current moral phiosophy appears to be moving toward endowing the more complex  species with real ethical status. How much of that  progress may in fact be due to lesser voices in Christian tradition, I'm not knowledgeable enough to say. However, Dawkins is careful to include ethical coverage among his atheist's version of the Ten Commandments (p. 263) . <br /> <br />Of course, my cursory use of the Argument from Evil, even if filled out to a more adequate degree, would not necessarily disprove God's existence, at least so long as the apologist keeps retreating into the increasingly improbable \\"mysteries of God's plan\\". However, it does indicate the capacity of the Argument to make God's existence even more implausible than before. And though I'm dispositionally inclined to look for compromise on most issues, I suspect Dawkins is right. Ours really is a choice between reason and superstition. <br />

B000J103PC|5.0|I loved *The Devil Wears Prada*!  This is one of the few movies that when I watch the first 5 mintues of it, I knew that I was gonna love it.  That's how strong this movie allured you.  That's the way movies are supposed to be.<br /><br />Set in NYC, \\"homely\\" Andrea is looking for a job.  She is a law student turned journalist.  Somehow, she landed a job interview with Runway, which is THE fashion magazine that makes or breaks fashion and their respective designers.<br /><br />Andrea is out of the fashion league.  She's homely looking.  Her hair is simple.  Her clothes are frumpy and easy to notice that they're not of \\"top labels\\".  She's a regular in-shape girl to many of us.  However, to those in fashion, she's FAT!  Overall, she has no clue in the fashion industry.<br /><br />Enters the EIC of Runway, Miranda Priestly, who is like a demigoddess of the fashion world.  She is feared by her staff and designers.  She is seemingly rude, superficial, snobbish and spoiled.  However, she has thick skin and does know her stuff.<br /><br />With sheer luck, Andrea is hired as second assistant to Miranda.  She does all the dirty work such as putting Miranda's coat away, fetching her coffee and many others.  Meanwhile, British first assistant, Emily, is too busy kissing up to Miranda.<br /><br />Gradually, Andrea works her way up as first assistant.  With the help of the magazine's token gay designer, Nigel, Andrea's fashion improves which also gains Miranda's approval.  She is eventually given the coveted trip to Paris for the exclusive runways of the upcoming fashion.<br /><br />While she's moving up the ladder, she loses her soul.  She starts to blow her friends away.  She starts to put her work as priority over her boyfriend.  She starts to lose her goals as a journalist.  She starts to be like Miranda.  Miranda confirms that Andrea is a younger version of herself.<br /><br />The question is will Andrea give up her soul to remain in the fashion world?  Or will she quit the coveted job that \\"a million girls would kill for\\"?<br /><br />Meryl Streep is at her best in this film.  You must pay close attention to her eyes.  Her eyes emit strong meanings.  She'll glare, command, approve, reject, dismiss and all that with just her eyes.  She had me laughing at some parts.  Other parts, she had me commenting \\"oooo, what a b****!\\"  You either love her or hate her.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that *The Devil Wears Prada* was a wonderful film.  It's a simple film about moving up in a world that is demanding and determining if it is all worth it.  And if it is...at what cost?ll she quit the coveted job that \\"a million girls would kill for\\"? <br /> <br />Meryl Streep is at her best in this film.  You must pay close attention to her eyes.

0307346609|5.0|A terrific read. Carefully researched and constructed, amusing to read, witty, full of observations and insights about today's global political situation and potential future developments. It's engaging and funny and thought-provoking. This book is much more satisfying than the simple horror novel I expected. Read it for the story, read it for the political and social insight, read it for the good writing--just read it!

0743454537|4.0|Being my first Picoult Novel, I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable she was able to make reading about a family's battles with leukemia and each other. I'm not usually much for sad stories, but this one manages to be heart-rending, triumphant and believable enough to win me over. That each character is developed individually in his or her own voice was one of my favorite aspects of her writing--brilliantly simple--so effortless you might forget you're reading. Between \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" by Diana Gabaldon and \\"The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters\\" by Gordon Dahlquist, this book is the coffee bean sniff between perfume testers. My palate has been cleansed. I will definitely read her again.
B000B5XOY8|3.0|I remember watching this movie and wanting to love it since I am a fan of Batman but things just never jelled for me. There is plenty of eye candy to go around in this version of Gotham City. The main problems lie with the script where you feel jerked around whenever some decent momentum would take over only to be sabotaged by a randomly inserted, poorly written scene. Most of these scenes involve Jack Nicholson's Joker. Nicholson as always is a master of chewing the scenery until there is nothing left onscreen except his massive ego. He makes a good Joker, but this film is called Batman, that's the character we truly love and Tim Burton simply doesn't let the audience love him, constantly shifting the focus away from Bruce Wayne's inner turmoil to some nonsensical plot twist with the Joker.<br /><br />The Danny Elfman score is outstanding, Kim Basinger is entirely forgettable, Michael Keaton is decent, the Prince song near the end was too much and the Batmobile is a sight to behold! The sequel Batman Returns would be more interesting although far more twisted.
0743298020|5.0|I adored this book. Read it, especially if you are a writer. It's a beautiful work with so many well-chosen adjectives you might pee yourself, and it's an interesting story to boot. I won't spoil any of it for you, but here's an excerpt of one of Ms. Setterfield's beautiful paragraphs written by one my new favorite characters of all time, Vida Winter.<br /><br />\\"My gripe is not with lovers of the truth, but with truth herself. What succor, what consolation is there in truth, compared to a story? What good is truth, at midnight, in the dark, when the wind is roaring like a bear in the chimney? What you need are the plump comforts of a story. The soothing, rocking safety of a lie.\\"
B000B5XOXY|2.0|The executives at Warner Brothers wanted a new take on the Batman franchise. You want a new take, you hire a new director. Here comes Joel Schumacher into the boardroom.    Executives- \\"Hi Joel, we'd like you to direct this movie. We thought Batman Returns was too dark, do you think you can lighten up Batman for us? Add some color? That's what we're looking for.\\"    Schumacher- \\"Color? I love color! Do you guys like pretty neon colors?\\"    Executives- \\"We sure do!\\"    Schumacher- \\"Great, because pretty neon colors are my favorite thing in the world! Batman movies should be nothing but pretty neon colors!\\"    Executives- \\"We agree with your vision Joel. You're hired!\\"    Schumacher- \\"Yipee! I'm an artist!\\"    The rest is history. Batman Forever is a big, bloated mess of a summer popcorn movie but it gets the job done for the most part. That's if your idea of the job done is sucking out your brain cells endlessly for more than 2 hours. Was the subplot with the Riddler's brain drain machine a self-criticism by Schumacher of this infantile movie?    The problem with the Batman movies, ( until finally Batman Begins broke the rules ), is that the directors never wanted to take Batman seriously as a mythic character. They wanted to keep him shoe-horned as a comic book superhero with explosions and junk. That and they had too many villians, not enough Batman! Val Kilmer wanted to take a more serious approach to the character but his director was working towards a totally different goal and they did not see eye to eye. Nicole Kidman is good in the movie too, although she plays the alluring femme with far too much self-conscious air. Tommy Lee Jones is absolutely awful as Two-Face, just like his make-up. If you like Jim Carrey, you'll love his manianical over the top Riddler performance, he steals every scene he's in, the prima donna!    Too much color, too much noise, too much crud, too much of everything. Not enough of Danny Elfman's classic score. Actually Elfman's music is completely erased in favor of Elliot Goldenthal's not very interesting orchestral bloating. You can't blame them, they wanted a new Batman, they wanted a new sound. Batman Forever is a loud summer vehicle and easily forgettable were it not for all the noise but hey, at least this movie is not a shameful disgrace like Schumacher's follow up Batman & Robin, one of the worst debacles of the decade.
0425200450|2.0|I read this book because I felt silly claiming to be a big reader and never having read an Agatha Christie mystery. Do I dare say I'm disappointed? I knew the end less than halfway through so reading the whole thing was perfunctory. Luckily, it's fairly short. Instead of keeping me on the edge of my seat it had me sliding off as I struggled to not doze off. I know it's a classic, a trendsetter by a truly original and insanely successful author, but I'm sorry. I wasn't wowed. Perhaps I haven't made enough of an investment in her creation. After all I've only gotten to know Hercule Poirot in the context of one story. I might give him--and her--another chance, but not likely any time soon.
B000A88EVE|1.0|There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a \\"cult classic\\" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?    Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!    It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by comparison is painfully incompetent.    The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...     The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I know it's a bit more cost-wise than a normal cd, but if you even remotely like the blues you really need to check this out.  The music is incredible and the movie (unlike some dvd's attached to cd's) is fantastic.  A great trip through history and interviews with some really talented bluesmen.  Hopefully some of the proceeds of the disc go to these talented men because as you'll see many live in impoverished conditions even though their music has inspired many of todays very successful musicians.  Its definitely worth the purchase price!!
B00009L1TA|1.0|This movie should be shown to classrooms of aspiring screenwriters and directors as an example of how not to be sucked into the Hollywood junk machine. The screenwriter of this movie obviously had some ideas about a coherent story that he wanted to tell about moral relativity and corrupt military officials. This film's story structure is mostly influenced by the classic film Rashomon. Well, so what happened? How did this ungracious disaster of a movie make it to the big screen? The biggest culprits are easily the movie stars, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, using their bloated star egos to force the screenwriter to rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable to their star personas. Disgusting! Travolta was supposed to be a bad guy and Jackson was supposed to bite the bullet, but no way would the two Hollywood jerks allow that!    SPOILER ALERT: Who in their right mind was surprised by the ending? I knew Sam Jackson was in on it from the get go and soon enough he would grace us with his presence. Lo and behold, his bald head emerges at the end of the movie wearing a white outfit like an angel of some sort. I hate this movie, it's an insult to the audience! John McTiernan, ( Predator, Die Hard ), the director of Basic should be ashamed of such a lackluster effort on his part. But what could he do when faced with the two morons who played the leads! A sad joke of a movie, avoid it unless you just love junk.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|Tim Burton really wants to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. Ok, every filmmaker wants to be taken seriously. With Burton, it's a toss up, he's got a wacky style, a good visual sense and he can tell a story populated with interesting characters. In the end however, the man is nothing more than a Hollywood hack, painfully wanting to be edgy. Here is Batman Returns, one of his better movies, far below Ed Wood, far above Planet of the Apes.    It's almost a joke that the circus plays a significant element in this movie because that's one of Burton's prime sensibilities, the circus freakshow. Just like the first Batman movie, this film focuses more on the villians than on our beloved superhero, which is a shame as far as storytelling is concerned but redeemable by the fact that all three villains, ( Catwoman, Penguin, Shreck ), are quite interesting.     I saw this movie as a kid so I still have fondness for it from a nostalgic standpoint, ( Danny Elfman's score is even more fantastic in this sequel ), but I also see in hindsight just how wrong a choice Tim Burton was for the Batman franchise. He made a fascinating, moral character into an afterthought and paraded a bunch of freaks with dilemmas, ticks, anxieties and the like as the main attraction. Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne/Batman so low-key that you end up being more interested in the villians, which is a shame because Batman is such a mythic character. We had to wait until 2005 when Christopher Nolan finally brought us the Batman film we all deserved to see, the terrific Batman Begins!
B00005JPE7|3.0|I haven't seen any of the previous Rocky movies, so I watched this through completely innocent eyes. I wasn't sure about it at first, what with not having seen any of the previous five, and I was wondering if it would be one of those films, where you HAVE to have seen the previous films.<br /><br />I was surprised when I found myself not only enjoying the film, but also getting emotionally involved. Sly did the right thing when he got this up and running by NOT making the viewers feel the need to see the previous films. There were only a couple of brief flashbacks, which were necessary, and relevant.<br /><br />The film begins with Rocky, now a hero in Philadelphia and running his own restaurant, letting his old sparring partners eat for free, and telling the locals his old stories. It cuts a pretty sad story, he's a washed up ex boxer, who actually looks like he's been a few too many rounds in the ring. I did get the impression; maybe it was just me, that he's desperate for company. Rocky constantly greeted people with \\"Hey, how u doin'?\\" Practically adopted a woman he remembered walking home as a little girl, and her son, and gave them both a job. It comes across as a bit desperate in the character of Rocky. His wife is dead, he's estranged from his only son, who seems to be embarrassed of his old pa, and it's a very lonely life. His son doesn't want anyone to meet his old boxer dad at his work, even though he only got the job because of his surname.<br /><br />Of course, there's a new kid on the block, and they start comparing him to the old Rocky, and who would win in a fight. A computer whiz-kid simulates the fight. Rocky sees this, thinks about it for a nano-second, and starts training again, despite protests from the licensing committee, his son, his friends, and people in the restaurant. Many think he cannot do it, many people say he can't, right to his face, but that just makes Rocky all the more defiant.<br /><br />The training montage is definitely one of the highlights of the movie, along with the terrific song backing it. It shows Rocky trying desperately to get back into shape (and Sly himself too, since he's admitted in interviews, that he let himself slide, and can't do as many things as he could do in the earlier films), from not being able to bench press very much, to a whole lot! Honestly it made my eyes water how much he ended up bench pressing & lifting in weights. Ouch.<br /><br />The final fight scene is of course, what we've all been waiting for throughout the film. It's the climax, and wow, what a climax. I wouldn't have said I would normally go to watch a boxing match - it's more an American thing really, I think? In fact, I hate boxing, but the film captures the electric atmosphere in the stadium, and I found myself getting caught up in the excitement. If there hadn't been people around me, I probably would have started jumping up and down in my seat. Of course, you're just waiting for him to get up, when he gets knocked down, urging him to get up, and obviously, will he win, or won't he? And it's also intercut with very brief flashbacks to previous Rocky matches. Flashbacks were used from every Rocky movie apart from Rocky V, which Sly admits himself is the weakest in the series.<br /><br />I thought it was quite good how they finished it. I was expecting the ending to be clear-cut, but it's not, and it's good that it's not.<br /><br />The one thing that got me watching Rocky Balboa was the fact that no matter how much plastic surgery Jackie Stallone has, Sly is basically turning into her!!! It was scary watching him on screen and seeing Jackie, which I never really noticed in Demolition Man, or his older films. He is turning into his mother.<br /><br />Overall I think this was a good idea (some people do disagree with me) for Sly to revisit Rocky one last time, and just wrap it all up. If I'd seen the previous movies, then it would have been a good way to end it all - if I had, I'd probably have been totally fed up with it all by now! The ending does seem very final, but then that means nothing these days. I have to applaud Sly for returning to the role after 15 years, showing he still has what it takes, showing he still has the body (his shoulders are the width of me lying down no exaggeration!), and showing he can still hack it in the ring. He is 61 this summer after all. It is a good film to go see if you have seen the previous five or even if you haven't. Excellent film.I'd probably have been totally fed up with it all by now!

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|There were and are a few grumblings from critics here and there but ultimately this film garnered near unanimous applause and a huge sigh of relief. Batman Begins is not perfect by any measure but is easily the best Batman movie ever, not that it had serious competition from it's predecessors. The first thing director Christopher Nolan does is say the hell with the neon colors, the over the top comic book sensibility, the freakshow circuses, let's take Batman back to his roots. Strip him of all the tarnish and the villians and the crazy gadgets. Let's go to the core of who he is. Who is Batman? Who is Bruce Wayne? How did Bruce Wayne become Batman? Everyone knows the answers to these questions but we never saw these questions answered vividly before our very eyes on the cinematic screen before Batman Begins. One of the genius strokes of this movie is the fact that Batman is not even shown onscreen for the first hour of the film! Unbelievable! That had to have Warner Brothers executives biting their fingernails incessantly. Will those pesky teenagers in the audience sit still as the story of Batman is allowed to unfold at an unhurried pace? Apparently those pesky teenagers weren't so dumb after all since the film was quite a hit. Hey, even adults liked this movie, two birds with one stone.    Christian Bale is the best actor to inhabit this character, ever. Some may have their nostalgia for Michael Keaton but Keaton was very low-key and let the freakshow villians dominate his movies with their antics. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman is a marked difference from previous actors, he is involving and fascinating as a character. From the tragedy of his past to the glory of his future, the whole path of this character makes perfect dramatic sense. Michael Caine does his job as Alfred, Liam Neeson is an intelligent villian, Cillian Murphy gets a bit on my nerves, but anyhow, the only person who lets the cast down is Katie Holmes. She's just there to be a pretty face andshe's not that pretty! Gary Oldman as Gordan is right on the money. Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson and even Rutger Hauer are terrific supporting characters. Ken Watanabe's short appearance is significant too. That's a lot of name actors!    The script and pacing are terrific, however Batman Begins does have it's faults. Let me list them. There seems to be too many characters and plot points as if Nolan wants to ram a far more epic story into the running time. Then there is the question of the action scenes, Nolan's directing of action is still in it's infancy and there is no action set-piece to take your breath away and go, \\"Wow, that's amazing!\\". So the action scenes leave something to be desired and the Batmobile looks like [...] to be honest, but it's design makes sense in light of Nolan's more realistic take on the whole Batman mythology. ( The Batmobile still looks very derivative, admit it! ).    Overall, this film was a joy to watch. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen and was very happy to finally be witness to the Batman film we all rightfully deserved. In light of the box-office victory and the critical triumph, this film should not have been called Batman Begins, but instead Batman Redeemed!
B000J10ERO|5.0|This movie succeeds in bringing superman back into our minds and adds another chapter to his legend.  <br /> <br />A lot of people give this movie a bad review. I have to admit- the stakes are high. Original masterpieces of movie history are not easily outdone by something new! Naturally, everybody's expectations are very high! I was not too excited after seeing the movie for the first time. It seemed too conforming to Hollywoods predictable plot line for Super Hero Movies. <br /> <br />This safety approach makes this movie boring and repetetive at times.  <br />But after the second viewing I liked this movie much better! I could see it for what it really is- in an neutral way. Visually this movie is quite stunning- the landscapes are well done! This movie is worth seeing alone for the amazing Special Effects!  <br /> <br />Yes, the Story line could have been better, but this leaves the story the needed room to grow into a series... The basic characters are established and the foundation work is done. Now the creators of the second part can focus more on story as the mood of the movie is already established. If you have a good plot idea for the next movies, you should post it on the internet, where the author(s) of the next superman movies can read about it. <br /> <br />We discussed our best story ideas that superman should engage in after wathching the movie. We thought he could definetely become more involved in helping the world as a whole by solving environmental pollution issues or stopping countries from fighting each other in wars. We envisioned a less action driven superman, one that uses his brain as a keen strategist with an eye on a better future for humanity... Action should tie various plot lines together, so viewing can become a more creative process. There should be some kind of AHA effect/ surprise in the next movie!  <br />So, what is your idea? <br /> <br /> <br />
B000G7PNAE|5.0|The enhanced version of Escape is great, has a few more songs, like La Raza Del Sol, by the way, a great song. If you are a hard core Journey fan like myself, I suggest getting this disk. You will really enjoy everything.

B00005JLKB|5.0|This 1st season is a great introduction to Clark Kent and his struggle with being abnormally strong, super fast, and impervious to harm. He discovers his true origins and falls in love for the 1st time.  It's Superman in his adolescence and it's wonderfully done! <br /> <br />I didn't start watching this show on a regular basis until it began it's 4th season.  I caught some old episodes on ABC Family and was instantly hooked!!  I've been a fan ever since!
6304696558|1.0|Why has this movie never been released in Widescreen format? I absolutely refuse to buy a movie in fullscreen format that was originally released in the theaters in widescreen. Let's face it folks, when a movie is viewed fullscreen a good part of the movie is missing. The exception to this is older movies that were actually realeased in theaters in this format. Other than that, it is a great comedy which I would love to own in it's original format.
0671502484|5.0|The Prize is one of the best books I've ever read. I wish I could give it a couple of bonus stars in my rating here. <br />You'd really be selling this book short to think of it just as a history of oil, the oil business, and oil politics in the middle east. Even that would have been an ambitious book but Yergin makes it so much more. It honestly is a thorough history of the entire 20th century (sans the 90s) viewed through the perspective of the oil industry. <br />As each chapter, era, decade, and war unfolds in Yergin's story, you'll gain a much better understanding of the roots of many of the US public's stances on big business, anti-trust legislation, and other pivotal issues of the last 100 years. You'll see how pivotal energy resources were in shaping the planning and rationale for 2 world wars and how the ready availability or lack of oil played as much of a role in winning and losing those wars as did battlefield strategies and the valor of the millions of soldiers involved. You'll see the role oil and energy played in the final collapse of the great imperial powers. <br />Probably most relevant to 2007, the lessons Yergin teaches about middle east history, the changing power roles the evolved in the last 50-60 years as the power shifted from the oil companies to the oil producing countries. Tracing the roots of nationalization of oil production in Mexico and Venezuela is a great stepping stone to understanding out current relationship with Venezuela but it also properly frames the story of the origins of OPEC and OPEC policies. And it's so important to get a understanding of the power plays, who's who, back room deals, and longstanding rivalries that built and reinforced the animosity that so many in the middle east felt and feel toward the US and other western and oil consuming countries. <br />It also traces the missteps and failed attempts at alternative energy sources as far back as the turn of the 19th century, including how alternative sources for aviation fuel provided the German Luftwaffe almost enough fuel to keep going in WWII. And it's easy to see how most other western nations have failed miserably to make the alternative fuel investments that might have paid those same kind of dividends. <br />The history of how many relations between nations were built on the personal charisma and power of individual leaders is also a powerful lesson for the future when you look at what happens to those relationships when the leader falls or is removed from power. Yergin's tracing of the entire story of the rise and exile of the Shah of Iran is must reading as western leaders might all be thinking while middle eastern leaders and families might be in danger of falling to that same fate and what effect that would have on our immediate oil supplies. <br />Any western reader and especially readers in the US should look at Yergin's perspective on the fall of the British empire as partially a failure to efficiently transition from a coal economy (coal being a resource England was rich in) to an oil economy (oil being scarce in the British empire until the North Sea discoveries at which time it was really to late to matter). When the US oil balance tipped from exporter to importer and as that balance swings even more out of whack, US readers have to be forced to ask themselves, how long can the US sustain as a world power while exporting so many dollars in exchange for oil and even worse, how ill prepared we could be for a scarcity of oil 25, 50, or 70 years from now. The oil producing nations all recognized 50 or more years ago that their oil revenue would only last so long, that there are only so many decades worth of oil to pump out of the ground at a given pace, and that it was in their interest to maximize the revenue from each barrel pumped. The US and other consumers need to make the corollary discovery: that there is only such much oil to be had and we need to maximize the use and benefit out of each barrel pumped. <br />Fanatically, even though it covers all this ground, all these disparate topics, Yergin's writing is still incredibly readable and the story well put together. It's hard to imagine a history book that is a \\"page turner\\" but this one really is. <br />In short, if you haven't read this, you should. Maybe if every member of the US House and Senate and all the President's advisors would read this, a few light bulbs would turn on (compact fluorescent energy saving bulbs of course) regarding our energy and foreign policies.

B00009L1OB|2.0|I love Duran Duran and have ever since I heard their breakthrough hit Hungry Like the Wolf in 1982. They have made wonderful, fun, challenging music for almost thirty years now. Although Seven and the Ragged Tiger is one of their biggest selling albums, it is a creative misstep. Duran Duran and producer (the late) Alex Sadkin have buried elements of what made the first two Duan Duran albums so special -throbbing colorful basslines, sharp rhythms, cutting guitar lines - leaving little to replace them. The results sound like a muddle: lots of big empty spaces and weird exotic noises masking few catchy hooks or memorable musical ideas. Even the band's huge hit The Reflex had to be re-mixed to find radio airplay in 1984 - the lifeless version on this album will leave many listeners scratching their heads (The slicker \\"radio\\" version can be found on both Greatest or Decade). <br />A few highlights - New Moon on Monday, which boasts a strong chorus and great harmonies; Union of the Snake, a highly charged blast; and Shadows on Your Side, a song that stays truest to what most listeners loved about the first two Duran Duran albums.  <br />Duran Duran records before and after Seven and the Ragged Tiger have often scaled great, giddy heights - this one just barely gets off the ground.
B00005JPGM|5.0|Blood diamond is an amazing movie that combines elements of a thriller, drama and world politics all in a potent 2+ hour film. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film but it does deal with disturbing subject matter which is not for everyone. After watching this movie, i realized that although the Departed is an excellent movie, Blood Diamond is more emotionally-connected and intriguing which is why im happy Leonardo DiCaprio got his Oscar nom for this film.  <br /> <br /> its really too bad that it wasnt as successful as it should be. the film was not promoted very well and was released in only 1920 theatres when most expected blockbusters are released in well over 3000. i feel the warner bros didnt put much effort into the promotion of \\"Blood Diamond\\" other then an appearance on Oprah, which is not the target demographic for the film.  <br /> <br />Hopefully the film will be successful at the Oscars and then maybe Warner Bros will re-release it to capitalize on the moment. If you havent already seen Blood Diamond, i suggest spending the 8-10 bucks and experiencing the film in a theatre.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Which is probably why it's no longer on.  It has to be said, cliche or not:  If you enjoyed the movie \\"Serenity\\" this is a must see.  The only downside, artistically, is that the show had only the one season. <br /> <br />The menu navigation stinks, by the way, though this shouldn't reflect on the quality of the show.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|This was a great addition to the Marvel Animated films. This did a good job of going over the history of Iron man and bringing in a great villain like Mandarin. A great film and a must buy for  comic book fans. Its a bit slow in parts but hey you gotta have character development. Cant wait for Dr. Strange
B000067CPX|5.0|Keep in mind, I now own almost all the cds the RHCPs have ever made. But this still remains one of my favorites. It's so catchy, it's amazing. One of the songs that always sticks in my mind is \\"Midnight\\" because the melody in the chorus is so good. It's such an underrated song. The other songs like the title track, \\"By The Way,\\" \\"Can't Stop,\\" (One of my all time favorite Chilis songs ever. It's even one of my ringtones), \\"Cabron,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" (SO UNDERRATED. So pretty), \\"Don't Forget Me\\"....I could go on and on - so, basically the whole cd. The music just doesn't get old. I know Blood Sugar Sex Magik was revolutionary and that Californication started a lot of their radio play and fame, but this CD is definitely worth a listen. I couldn't get it out of my mind after I first heard it. Buy it now. You won't be disappointed at all :)
B00011KHTM|4.0|This is the official adaptor for an Apple mini-DVI connection to a VGA input. Cheaper than available from the Apple Store for the exact same product, it has that \\"Apple\\" look (and smell!!). Unfortunately if you have a 12\\" Powerbook or an iMac you have to get one of these to hook up any secondary monitors or projectors. It works perfectly and looks fine, but it would be nice to be able to use a standard DVI to VGA adaptor, of which I have several hanging around.
B000002UAI|4.0|BEATLES FOR SALE is a very different album from its predecessor: A HARD DAYS NIGHT.  AHDN consisted of all Lennon-McCartney compositions (the only Beatles album with this honour). The songs were of very high quality; immediately appealing and generally upbeat. This album, however shows The Beatles falling back on six cover versions and churning out eight original compositions.  Admittedly these are of a lesser quality than we expect from The Beatles. The album is full of clues that they were tired and felt like they were on a treadmill.  The title itself is cynical as if they realized they were just a piece of merchandise.  Most of the photos show them not smiling and the cover shows four men in their early twenties looking very scared and vulnerable, a huge contrast to their lovable mop-top persona. The album contains the most ironic liner notes of any album I know.  Derek Taylor, their press officer and \\"publicist\\" states in the liner notes that this is their best album to date! I really do not think anybody else would agree.    The first three tracks do set a sombre tone.  NO REPLY, I'M A LOSER and BABY'S IN BLACK are all sung by John and show his state of mind even though nobody else  realized this at the time  In fact the only two upbeat songs on Side One of the original LP are cover versions (ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC and KANSAS CITY/HEY HEY HEY HEY)).  However the next three albums of the Beatles start the same way; HELP leads off with three downers lyrically, RUBBER SOUL is their most bitter album and it is hard to find any fun, optimistic songs as only three exist on the album ( see my review).  The four openers on Revolver are hardly jolly although they are amazing songs unlike anything The Beatles had ever done before.    But this album does sound as if The Beatles were not that enthusiastic about recording it.  Exhaustion and the amazing pressures to write, record and perfom were taking their toll at this time.   However it is a shame because they could have substituted five or six non-album tracks to make it a much better album:  I CALL YOUR NAME, SHE'S A WOMAN, SLOW DOWN, LONG TALL SALLY, I FEEL FINE and LEAVE MY KITTEN ALONE.  They could have also included the original version of ONE AFTER 909, which is much better than the version on the LET IT BE album.  Songs that could have been left off are MR. MOONLIGHT, I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL THE PARTY, HONEY DON'T, EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO BE MY BABY and BABY'S IN BLACK.      But compared to other British albums of the time it is a masterpiece.  I put together a hypothetical album below with a  track listing for another classic Beatles album for late 1964.  Hope you might agree. I do not really care for BABY'S IN BLACK, but I have listed it as a possible contender. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL THE PARTY is one of my least favourite Lennon-McCartney compositions so it stays off! Songs with a * are cover versions.    (LP Side 1)  1. I feel fine  2.18  2. I'll follow the sun  1.47  3. Rock and roll music*  2.30    4. No reply  2.14  5. I call your name  2.07  6. I'm a loser 2.30 or Baby's in black 2.04  7. Kansas city/Hey, hey, hey, hey* 2.31    ( LP Side 2)  1. Eight days a week 2.42  2. What you're doing 2.31  3.

6303998704|4.0|I saw this film as a kid and recently saw it again. It really holds up. The scene on the bridge sent shivers down my spine and all the carnival stuff holds up well. The musical score by Gene Moore is sufficiently eerie to keep the mood creepy. All praise goes onto Candace Hilligoss who plays Mary Henry in a very intense performance, that is both eerie and surreal. She really makes the film work. The directing by Herk Harvey is very good for a B movie. This movie goes on a little long but it is still worth seeing.
B000002UAO|5.0|In the short space of four months between the release of Help! in August 1965 and the release of Rubber Soul in December 1965, The Beatles underwent a huge change in direction.  It is inconceivable today that any singing act could release two albums in such a short time.  Not only that but notice how different these two albums sound.  HELP was the beginning of the end of the lovable mop-top image with songs like Another Girl, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, You Like me Too Much, It's Only Love etc.  Except for the title song and  You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, they still dealt mainly with boy and girl in love themes.<br /><br />Four months later what happened?  The songs on Rubber Soul reek of bitterness, sarcasm and a hostility against women.  They may be dressed up in memorable pop tunes that we all know but their attitude towards Women and Life was very dismissive.  There are only three songs on the album that have an upbeat love tone: The Word, Michelle and Wait.  Michelle is very overrated; Wait was written at an earlier time and is pleasant but not great.  Otherwise the album is brimming with classics:  Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, Girl, I'm Looking Through You, The Word, Nowhere Man, George's two songs: If I Needed Someone and Think for Yourself.  But John's song, In My Life is the album's gem, a sad love song that should have been the album's closing track instead of the inferior Run For Your Life.<br /><br />The Beatles had matured with this album and we are all the better for it. In the space of two short years they had developed from From Me To You and I Want To Hold Your Hand to Drive My Car and Norwegian Wood.<br /><br />Different influences had opened up to them at this point.  The Stones, Dylan, drugs, The 60s.  There would be no going back to the haircuts, the suits,  the pressure of chrurning out albums.  They released albums from here on at their own pace.  This album separated The Beatles from the rest of the pack.  And the rest of the pack hashad a hard time catching up ever since.

0060537639|4.0|Popular works of history that focus on a particular year are becoming more and more common.  On my own shelves I see the following titles: 1066 and All That, 1215, 1453, 1491, 1918 and Paris 1919.  Given time, we may have a volume for every year in history.  For the moment, add one more: 1421.  And what was crucial about the year 1421?  Well, the subtitle informs us that this was \\"the year China discovered America.\\"<br /><br />Apparently, in the year 1421, Emperor Zhu Di of China sent a fleet of hundreds of ships out from Beijing with orders to explore the entire earth and, of course, bring back tribute from whomever they find.  What is lost to us is the direct evidence of the success of these voyages.  In the two years over which the fleet was gone, the emperor had fallen and China was beginning its decent into a society almost completely closed off from the outside world.  Along with that came the destruction of nearly all evidence and records of these voyages until they were forgotten.  Complicit in this destruction were the explorers of the West who wanted to take advantage of the wealth of these \\"unexplored\\" lands.<br /><br />Menzies does a fairly good job of presenting his evidence of Chinese exploration.  There is no doubt that, until their inward turn, China had the most advanced science, ships and navigation of the day.  China had well established sea routes from the east coast of Africa to India to Southeast Asia to the homeland for centuries previous to this final voyage.  They had the ability to calculate latitude and longitude.  They were excellent cartographers.<br /><br />What is less clear is the evidence of the voyages of these \\"treasure ships\\"--huge junks that outclassed European ships of the period  by orders of magnitude.  That the ships existed, there can be little doubt.  Observers of the period recorded them and wrecks have been found and dated.  But where did they go?<br /><br />By some accounts, everywhere.  Menzies' analysis of fifteenth century maps is very powerful.  That these ships sailed places--Australia, South Pacific Islands, North and South America, Antarctica--that Europeans would not follow until two to four centuries later is very convincing.  The likelihood that European explorers like Columbus had copies of Chinese maps seems revealed in their own writings and gives credence to his claims.  His evidence of Chinese landings and possible colonies in the Americas and elsewhere is interesting and plausible, if less convincing than some of the rest.<br /><br />If there is a weakness in Menzies' book, it is in the prose.  He can come across as defensive about his claims and almost desperate to have people believe him.  The end of the book feels a bit rushed and leaves some interesting questions unaddressed, as if he wanted to get his stuff out there before someone else trumped him.  He would have been better off to simply let the story unfold and the evidence speak for itself.  Still, by his own admission, he is an \\"amateur\\" and it is easy to be forgiving, seeing what he feels are the magnitudes of his claims.<br /><br />As to that point, I feel less moved than Menzies.  That the Chinese may have explored the world and laid the groundwork for European exploration with borrowed maps may very well be true.  It may very well be true that Chinese sailors and colonists made landfall at various spots around the globe, setting up their own villages and even intermixing with local populations.  It is absolutely fascinating to think about.  On the other hand, despite this, it is the Europeans who took advantage of exploration and colonization while the Chinese retreated.  Had they not, the world today might look very different.  But they did.  Menzies doesn't address what that means.  In this, perhaps, he shows most clearly that he is not a professional historian.  Still, he deserves a lot of credit for an interesting book.  It should be read and its meaning addressed.eenth century maps is very powerful.

Still, by his own admission, he is an \\"amateur\\" and it is easy to be forgiving, seeing what he feels are the magnitudes of his claims. <br /> <br />As to that point, I feel less moved than Menzies.  That the Chinese may have explored the world and laid the groundwork for European exploration with borrowed maps may very well be true.  It may very well be true that Chinese sailors and colonists made landfall at various spots around the globe, setting up their own villages and even intermixing with local populations.  It is absolutely fascinating to think about.  On the other hand, despite this, it is the Europeans who took advantage of exploration and colonization while the Chinese retreated.  Had they not, the world today might look very different.  But they did.  Menzies doesn't address what that means.  In this, perhaps, he shows most clearly that he is not a professional historian.  Still, he deserves a lot of credit for an interesting book.  It should be read and its meaning addressed.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I watched this film twice and loved it even more the second time around. As a light-hearted comedy it follows the travails of the frustrated, gangly, unseemly, and misanthropic high schooler, Napoleon, along with his circle of similarly weirdo and disenfranchised characters that surround him--his brother Kip who specializes in chat rooms, Pedro the improbable class president, Uncle Rio a door-to-door salesman, and his heart throb Deb. Napoleon is hazed at school, envies Pedro's mustache, lies about having a gorgeous girl friend, and musters his best compliment to Deb at the dance: \\"I like your sleeves; they're big.\\" These central characters are all decidedly uncool. But everyone needs a friend, and at times watching this film makes you squirm when you appreciate the very real social realities that it parodies. Best of all is the film's sugary ending.
B000K7UBTI|5.0|I'm gonna keep it short and sweet because for the most part, I'm agreeing with the positive reviews/posts on the long-awaited Iron Man animated flick. I picked this one up as soon as it hit the rack and I must say that I was mind-blown...the 21st century upgrade, the storyline, the animation, the sci fi, the mysticism, the action, and the suspense were all there. This is yet another awesome Marvel Entertainment answer to the slew of DC Comics animated series/movies that have been dominating the media for the past decade or so, as a matter of fact, I recommend this one over the Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2(even though both are keepers just for being the 1st 2 Marvel animated movies). This one'll leave you all the more in anticipation of the live action Iron Man movie, the Doctor Strange animated movie, and many more(I'm hoping to see an all-new Incredible Hulk animated movie). Fundies may not agree, but this is a perfect example of a 21st century upgrade(via the Ultimates series) done right. Much respect to Marvel for giving us a HOT project featuring one of comicdom's most underrated legandary superheroes. Give us more!!!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|\\"Life is nothing but a beauty pageant with everyone judging you all the time.\\" So complains Dwayne, a sullen teenager who reads Nietzsche and scribbles notes to his dysfunctional family because he's taken a vow of silence. Not a bad move, either. His father Richard spouts cliches about his motivational series called \\"Refuse to Lose\\" that is an abysmal failure. Wife and mom Shery is the peace-maker-enabler. Her brother Frank is a Proust scholar who tried to commit suicide, and her foul-mouthed father who lives with the family kills himself snorting heroin. \\"Welcome to hell,\\" Dwayne scribbles to Frank. Little Olive, the darling of the family, won a trip to the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" beauty pageant, so the entire family piles into their dilapidated VW van for the 800-mile trip from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach. They endure the calamities and indignities you would expect, then find redemption of sorts that bespeaks a larger and more serious lesson to us all when they deconstruct the pageant in unlikely ways. Thank God for the Harris family!
B00005JKED|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I loved this movie. Probably one of my favorites and definately one of the best in summer cinema. If you're planning to buy it, stop planning and just do it.<br /><br />But I have only one complaint. Is it just me, or did Ethan Hawke not get enough recognition for his role? Not even a \\"Best Supporting Actor\\"? This man spent 80% of the movie getting the snot beat out of him. The least he could get was a seat wtih Oprah. Not that I don't think that Denzel did an amazingly outstanding job; I just think that Hawke played his role wonderfully, and got next to no recognition for it. That made me sad.<br /><br />Okay, so I laughed a little. But I did feel bad.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Viewers have had strong opinions pro and con about writer-director David Lynch's film, but everyone agrees that it is futile to search for a linear, comprehensible narrative. To say that the perky Betty helps the amnesiac Rita find her true identity does not begin to communicate the complexity, or absurdity, of this film. Admirers argue that Lynch has given us a brilliant study in the surreal; detractors claim it is all incomprehensible style over meaningful substance and that he is only messing with our minds. Like a dream, this film is at once unreal and incoherent, but nevertheless very powerful. In what sense are your own, human dreams \\"real?\\" If you appreciate thinking about the complexity of that question you will like Mulholland Drive; if not, skip this movie.
B000ION23K|4.0|Before watching this movie, I thought it would be some sort of rehash of Antz or A Bug's Life.  In fact, it was totally different, with a unique and very original storyline.  Lucas Nickle is the protagonist, the new kid on the block who gets roughed up by Steve, the neighborhood bully.  He takes out his anger on the anthill in his yard, subjecting them to kicks, sprays from the lawn hose, and the dreaded \\"yellow rain\\".  But what goes around comes around as the ants' wizard, Zoc, concocts a potion that shrinks Lucas down to size.  He is taken to the ant colony, and forced to live with the ants until he learns their ways.  At first reluctant, Lucas soon gets in a groove and his training culminates in his saviour of the colony.  For this he is rewarded with an ant name, the complete adulation of the colony, and a return to his original size.   <br /> <br />There are several aspects of the movie worth commenting.  First, the look of the ants is quite similar to the 1990's movie Antz.  Second, the CGI is pretty impressive and all the scenery, animals and people look realistic enough.  Third, there is a fair amount of action, but little violence, so the movie is appropriate for all ages.  Fourth, the comedy is subtle and clean.  Overall, the movie is worth watching.
B00005JLR8|4.0|Sarah and Johnny move with their two young girls from Ireland to tenement housing in New York City. A few floors below them Mateo of Nigeria has scrawled \\"Keep Away\\" on his door in bright orange letters, and screams in rage. Why he does so, and what happens when Johnny's family discovers why, form the crux of this film. In America is only partly a story about immigration, and more about grief, loss and friendship among these five people. This was a good but not great film, even though it earned three Academy Award nominations.

As the most famous chef in America, husband, and father, he plays John Clasky, and is married to Deborah, a suburban housewife who raises the bar for what it means to be a type-A control freak. When we meet her mother Evelyn we understand why.This Los Angeles family is very wealthy and profoundly dysfunctional. Enter Flor, a Mexican housekeeper who has a teenage daughter Cristina who is the same age as the Clasky's daughter Bernice. Since her mom does not speak English, Cristina narrates the film for us. You can imagine the sub-plots of this \\"blended\\" family, but in the end Flor is a source of humanity, warmth, and normalcy for everyone.

B000068TPN|4.0|I watched this film after a friend who was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam recommended it as the best film on that war. Starring Mel Gibson as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, the film tells the true story of the first major encounter between American troops and North Vietnam. There, in the la Drang Valley (\\"the Valley of Death\\"), 450 Americans were dropped by helicopters into a clearing and subsequently ambushed and surrounded by 2,000 Viet Cong from October 23 to November 6, 1965. In addition to capturing the bravery, patriotism, heroism, horror, and idiocy of war, this film is special for at least two reasons. First, it portrays the battles that the families who were left at home also had to fight while their loved ones were 12,000 miles away. The entire first third of the film focuses on the families at home, and the rest of the film repeatedly cuts back to them. Second, the film humanizes the enemy. The enemy must be fought, but they are not \\"evil.\\" In fact, we learn that they are just like us. There are five prayers in this film, one of which is by a Viet Cong and which, verbatim, could have been uttered by any human being. Similarly, right after watching a young American widow grieve, the film cuts to a young Vietnamese widow crying as she clutches a diary returned from her dead husband (the diary contains her own picture that her husband had carried). The end of this film names the Americans who died at la Drang; it also pays tribute to \\"the members of the People's Army of North Vietnam who died in that place.\\" There are no winners or losers in this film, or any political statements, for in the last few minutes we learn that these soldiers \\"fought not for country or for flag but for each other.\\" We Were Soldiers is based upon the book We Were Soldiers Once, and Young (1992) by Lt. Col. Hal Moore and Joseph Galloway, a photo journalist who was embedded with the American soldiers for the duration of the battle.
B000001I0K|5.0|Alright, mein wunderkind, it's another 'should've been 10 stars' review.Robert Johnson met the devil at the crossroads; Lux and Ivy met him in a deep zombie and cannibal-infested jungle with visions of horror filling their already demented minds. Psychedelic Jungle remains one of the best albums to come from the early eighties, period.The covers sound like the Cramps wrote these themselves (and back in the day, when I first heard tracks off this album on the radio, I thought they did). Their version of The Crusher will have you heading for the next wrestling arena with the sole intent of getting in the ring and placing a well-placed smackdown on the WWE. Beautiful Gardens is garage rock from guaranteed hell. The Gravest Hits tracks are mostly covers, done in that insane style that we've come to expect from the Cramps (and also among their earliest material). Get this before the apocalypse takes place!
B00005ATQF|4.0|In 2003 the US military budget exceeded the military spending of all other countries combined. For some this is a cause to glorify war, so a film that reminds us of the obscenity, vulgarity and human carnage of battle is a good bet. Writer and producer Stanley Kubrick follows a group of Marines from basic training on Paris Island to bombed out buildings with snipers in Vietnam (filmed on sets in England). The sadistic drill sergeant has an amazing gift for obscenity as he trains these his \\"ministers of death.\\"
B000ICM5MG|5.0|All the reviewers have hit the nail right on the head with this fabulous 2-Disc Collector's Edition of Rocky.  If you love this movie as much as I do, then you'll find that all of the extras on this particular editon are definitely worth the upgrade.  There's well over two hours of behind-the-scenes information on Disc 2, along with the special tribute to the late Burgess Meredith, who played Mickey.  As one of the other reviewers also mentioned there's a special feature about the director of photography, Garrett Brown, and his invention of the steadicam, which enables a cameraman to use a hand-held camera to film with, but without the jerky movements that usually accompanies it on a moving shot.  In the feature, Garrett films his wife running down the famous outside steps of the Philidephia Museum of Art.  He runs alongside of her with his steadicam.  Once they get down to the bottom (and he's out of breath from this), she immediately turns around and runs back up the steps.  He decides to follow her back up, but this time his camera is more focused on her bottom than anything else.  That was funny.  Also, it was that particular footage of the Art Museum's steps that caused the director of Rocky, John Avildsen, to put in the scene of Rocky running up the steps to the top and then jumping up and down with his arms straight up in the sign of victory before the big fight with Apollo Creed.  The special Easter Egg of Sly talking to his fictional character, Rocky, is from the 2001 DVD that came out with all the movies in a boxed set, but it's still wonderful to watch.  You tend to forget that it's actually one person and get emotionally caught up in the dialogue between the two men as they thank each other for the success that was brought to them.  Both Sly and Rocky make funny comments about the other's height, each thinking that the other person was taller than he actually is.  In real life, Sly's only about 5'6\\", but he does look taller in all of his movies.  Also, Rocky calls him Rambo just before Sly gives him the Oscar statue that he won for Best Picture of 1976.  Last, but not least, a free ticket to see Rocky Balboa was included, which saved me eight dollars when I went to see it on Christmas Eve day.  So this special edition ended up costing me on $12.00, rather than twenty.  The ticket expires on January 31st, so there's still time to use it if you can find Rocky Balboa playing somewhere.  This is certainly a \\"must-have\\" for any serious collector of DVDs, not to mention fans of the movie.  I, for one, don't like double-dipping by the movie studios, but when a ton of extras are included on a new edition, I simply have to go for it.  This is the ultimate edition of Rocky, and I think it was made especially for the fans.  I hope the studio does the same kind of treatment with Rocky Balboa when it comes out on DVD in a few months.

B000065NOS|3.0|This movie got some seriously bad reviews, but I liked it as a biting and farcical satire of the idiocies of the modern fashion industry.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|What makes this movie so bad?<br />Poor acting mixed with bad directing and story that takes itself entirely too serious to start with.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is not a good actor unless you call long unintelligent stares mixed with a cheap sexuality brilliant- for some reason Marlon Brando could pull that off, this guy can't.  Jamie Foxx, on the other hand has proved himself in the past to be a good actor.  In this movie he's not.  Perhaps it's the directing, poor script or teaming up with Farrell; but he comes off as very one dimensional in his performance.  The supporting cast does not fare much better.<br /><br />In fact if it weren't the graphic violence, this movie could become quite campy because everything and everyone takes themselves sooo seriously.  I think the film makers had every intention that they were making a profound film that would change lives and uncover the dark side of Miami Vice- the problem is, they didn't check to see if anyone would care that much to see such [...].<br /><br />Miami Vice was a pretty good show in its day.  At times more a cultural phenomenon than actual quality, but you could always find something entertaining- even in its kitsch.  Miami Vice the movie steered far away from the original atmosphere of the show- basically stripping it of all that was interesting leaving just another gritty cop movie- the difference with Miami Vice is it was boring and pretentious.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Is there any cinematic icon more recognizable than the Phantom's mask? Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera opened in London on October 9,1986, and since then there have been more than twenty productions world-wide. In London there has never been a seat unsold. Over 50 million people have seen the show, and the box office gross world-wide stands at nearly $2 billion. So, why not a movie version to capture this wild success, even though a film can never compete with the live show? I love the story line, even though my wife and I differ in our responses to the Phantom, and I like the music. So, even though this film dragged along, and a friend of mine echoed the belief of many when he described the show as \\"cheesy,\\" I still enjoyed it. With Roger Ebert, I recommend this film even though I really did not think it was a very good film.

B00080Z53O|4.0|I don't think this film adds anything new to the debate about so-called \\"death with dignity\\" or the right to end your own life. But it is a tender and nuanced treatment of the subject that raises the major questions and includes the major stakeholders--the legal system, a religious priest who is caricatured as moralistic and uncaring, friends, and a three-generation family that lives with and cares for the quadriplegic Ramon, who after a diving accident 26 years ago wants to end his life since, he insists, it is a life with no dignity. Ramon's brother adamantly objects: \\"nobody kills anyone in my house.\\" Others are not so sure. Four women in particular loom large in the film's plot. I will not spoil Ramon's final choice, which to the film's credit is not clear until the very end. The Sea Inside is based upon a true story in Spain, and was voted Best Foreign Film for 2004. In Spanish with English subtitles.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I'm a surround-sound junkie and therefore will like almost anything that is mixed in 5.1 and I now finally have a DTS and Dolby Digital system with 800 watts.     This album is nothing short of amazing. I would like to have seen the show that it is based upon, but that's not necesssary to enjoy this technological marvel. The first new Beatles album in decades. I'm not a giant Beatles fan, being more the Elvis fan type, but I recognize good music when I hear it and George Martin and his son have created a 'Magical Mystery' disc, if you will.    Run out and get this special 2-disc edition before they're gone!

Leonardo DiCaprio impresses me each time more and more  - he was always good from the beginning but now he's got the depth and maturity to go along with his raw talent. I give this film my highest recommendation and hope a lot of people will see it - it deserves to be seen.

B000GFLE1S|5.0|Like its off-beat predecessor Calendar Girls, this comedy will not appeal to everyone, but I thought it was one of those rare films that was both hilarious and poignant. When his father dies, much to his chagrin Charlie Price inherits the family's 100-year old shoe factory. Foreign imports and changing styles have pushed the Price factory to the brink of insolvency, until Charlie's chance encounter with the drag queen \\"Lola.\\" Whereas over the previous hundred years they had made \\"a range of shoes for men,\\" they switch to making \\"shoes for a range of men,\\" more specifically, shoes \\"for women that are men.\\" An unlikely friendship develops between Charlie and Lola, each of whom struggles with their own unique loneliness. With Lola consulting, the blue collar factory workers of Northampton learn about London fashion, and to their credit retool their factory with gusto to storm the Milan shoe show with their sturdy stilettos. The DVD blurb advises that the film is \\"inspired by a true story.\\" Rated PG-13.
B0000035E7|5.0|18 Years!  This came out in '89!  Back when I first bought this on cassette, probably about a month or so after buying \\"Nevermind\\", I remember thinking.... \\"ahhhh, a couple songs are okay\\".  It definitely did not appeal to me.  This is not the super-crisp punchy production of Butch Vig.  These aren't the pop infused songs that would grace their major label debut.  This is Cobain trying to latch on to a sound that his heroes (Melvins being a clear choice) were producing, while also trying to be differnt from that.  You can hear a pop sense in there... sometimes you just gotta dig for it.  Kurt never hid his influences... the whole band never did... they quite vocally spoke about who inspired them and who they stole from.  The great thing is, the bands they liked were actually worth noting in 90's/00's music progresion, unlike today where bands cite their friends as influences.  Today this album resonates much stronger with me.  The whole grunge \\"movement\\" really meant the world to me, and while a lot of meatheads would say the same, the music that came out between '90 and '95 really did shape my entire perspective of what could and couldn't be good.  This album is damn good.  I'm now a fan of most things \\"heavy\\".  I can hear these sounds all over bands like High On Fire, Wolfmother, Sunn O))), Queens Of The Stone Age (who didn't need much more influence than themselves... Kyuss), even Black Metal bands like Craft, etc.  Real heavy rockers with a penchant for creative flair.  Those who want to kill with their music and inspire and make you FEEL and MOVE.  This music really moves me today.  That's not to say that \\"Bleach\\" created a sound, or originated it, but it sure as hell displays it.  This album kills.  Those who love heavy rock should more than appreciate this.  Those who don't appreciate this, don't actually love hard n' heavy rock... you're posing, you're a liar and you should fess up.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|John Nash won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994 for work he had done as a Princeton grad student in the 1940s. In between, schizophrenia hounded him. His wife is the real hero. The film glosses over the seamier aspects of Nash's real life (see the biography by Sylvia Nasar), and gives the impression that lots of love will cure mental illness (wrong), but this is still a moving film that explores the borders between genius and madness.
B000002JR8|5.0|I'm listening to it right now... Jan. 24/07... when did this come out?  '94?!  This is still some truly inspirational sh!#!  Alot of people say that Pantera was their \\"gateway\\" band to more extreme music, but I'll be damned if this itself isn't some extreme music.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't this debut at #1 on Billboard?!  Could that even happen today?  I think not.  This was more than just a step up from \\"Vulgar...\\", this was a milestone in their career.  \\"The Great Southern Trendkill\\" would follow, and while it would push the limits of what their own fans deemed \\"acceptable\\", it was just that little bit outside their own boundaries which made it less accessible.  Regardless of what they'd done or where they'd go, \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is simply one the best HEAVY records of the 90's, if not all time in the heavily loaded metal canon.  It's thrash, it's death, it's their influences in hardcore, in the old-school, it's so southern it hurts.  Most notable is the fact that there isn't ONE BAND out there today that sounds like Pantera, and those that try (hello, Lamb Of God), receive either critical acclaim or pure hatred from the underground.  In the 90's, and even today, it's hard to find someone who doesn't enjoy or at the very least respect Pantera.  This is their \\"big break\\".  This is the album I always turn to when I need to feel \\"metal\\".  And really, how often do \\"big break\\" and \\"metal\\" coincide?  That says alot about \\"Far Beyond Driven\\".  Big in every way and SO metal.  And one point I absolutely need to add... until just a year or so ago, I never gave the lyrics a thought, but Phil wrote some really great lyrics.  Not \\"brutal\\" or \\"Grim\\" lyrics, generally real HONEST lyrics.  That's that hardcore influence shining through.  Where do you think all the mallcore kiddies and emo-core kids get this from?  'Cept Phil's honesty has nothing to do with heartache/heart break... Pantera was HARDCORE and his lyrics speak volumes about (at least his) passion, frustration, confusion.  That was/is a breath of fresh air in metal.ation, confusion.  That was/is a breath of fresh air in metal.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore's latest film won a standing ovation and top prize at the Cannes Film Festival (May 2004), then in its first week in American theaters became the highest grossing documentary of all time.  It's hard to tell who was more worried about this rabidly anti-Bush film--conservatives who fear Moore's mudslinging will stick to the President, or liberals who fear that mainstream America will label his views as way out of bounds and associate them with Kerry.  Time magazine rightly observed that Moore's method incorporates equal parts comedy, tragedy, infiltration, confrontation, and speculation.

Having watched it, I could see why it was both worthy of Oscar nominations and a bust.<br /><br />The cast was great, including Kris Kristofferson, John Hurt, Sam Waterson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, and Jeff Bridges.  It dealt with a range war between the ranchers and the immigrant farmers.  I don't know how accurate it is with history, but it showed a dark side where the rich ranchers were allowed by law to have people killed by bounty hunters without a warrant or trial.  If this wasn't depressing enough, the final scene clinched it.<br /><br />People love Westerns, but this movie was too dark for a Western to redeem.
B00005JMYI|3.0|Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, the lead news anchor for San Diego's Channel Four network news. Set in the 1970s, this biting satire does for the television news industry what Zoolander did for the fashion industry. Petty personalities, insipid news content about pregnant zoo animals, blow dried hair and toothy smiles, paltry humor, and blatant sexism remind us of the very thin border between film's fiction and whatever constitutes \\"real\\" news. Just last night on our \\"real\\" news the weatherman reported that San Jose had \\"four one hundredths of an inch of rain.\\" And he was serious. Watched as parody and farce, this film works. Network news has come a long, long way from the comforting, paternalistic intonations of Walter Cronkite.

I love the idea of surround mixing and listening to music in surround (Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' is the best example), but right from the get go \\"I feel you\\" had to be one of the worst excuses for 5.1 mixing I've ever heard.

Shame on you DM, you really let me down here. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|First there was his book (Earth in the Balance, 1992), then his road show about the book, and now a documentary film about Al Gore's road show to push the crisis--and it is a crisis--of global warming to the forefront of American public discourse. Regardless of your opinion about Gore's political history, here he combines the consensus of mainstream science with admirable passion to explain in lay terms a crucial issue of our day. This film lacks almost any creativity in that it simply shows Gore giving his Power Point presentation to a live audience. But it is a Power Point well worth considering. Gore includes charts, graphs, statistics, personal anecdotes and before-and-after pictures of the effects of global warming. In conjunction with the film's release Gore has published a book version of An Inconvenient Truth (2006). This would be a fine film to watch with older kids.

However, I fell in love with the original mix and after listening to this new 'revision', the mix has suffered greatly. Honestly one of the worst 5.1 mixes I've ever heard. I love the idea of surround mixing and listening to music in surround (Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' is the best example), but right from the get go \\"I feel you\\" had to be one of the worst excuses for 5.1 mixing I've ever heard. You would think for a band that really embraced technology they would have done a better job here, but no such luck I'm afraid. I am going to see if I can return this. Shame on you DM, you really let me down here.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and is given a life sentence at the Shawshank Prison. Similarly, longtime inmate \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) has wrongly been denied parole two times, and no wonder, for everything about this prison is evil. Warden Norton is cast as a fundamentalist Christian who issues Bibles to every incoming prisoner, quotes Scripture, whistles \\"A Mighty Fortress is Our God,\\" and who otherwise is a sadist. So, we root for the criminal inmates against the \\"good\\" government prison that tries, unsuccessfully, to dehumanize them. Three plot twists in the last half hour make this a fantastic film.

B00005K3OT|4.0|I viewed this film as a sort of modern day parable of the Good Samaritan: the most unlikely and even pagan person, Vianne, opens a chocolate shop during Lent (!) on the square of an uptight, moralistically Catholic town in 1950s France. But she brings the town together after the Christians had split them apart.
B00003CXA6|5.0|There is perhaps no event in American history that has been as well, and as frequently, recorded as the Civil War. Books and movies abound on the subject. I have designed at least four covers for books on Abraham Lincoln alone. Few of these tell the story better, or as well, as \\"Gettysburg\\" starring Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, and Martin Sheen. Based on the Pullitzer prize-winning book \\"The Killer Angels\\" by Michael Shaara, the movie is a stunning evocation of what it must have been like to fight for, and to die for one's convictions. The movie's epic scope, deep pathos, and historical accuracy transcend the actual event and make it a universal expression of the human condition that underscores the futility of war. \\"Gettysburg\\" is entertaining, educational, informative, and  a defining event in the birth of a nation. Run, don't walk, to add this DVD to your collection.  <br /> <br />Willem Hart, Toronto, Ontario
B000A5044C|4.0|Yagira Yuya won best actor at the 2004 Cannes festival for his role as Akira, a 12 year-old boy who cares for his three younger siblings when the four of them are abandoned by their mother. Paternity in this film simply does not exist, and in fact we might believe that the children had four different fathers. The few minutes we meet the mom, Keiko, early in the film would not discourage that idea. After Keiko moves her family into a new apartment she gives them several rules: only Akira can go outside, none of them will go to school, and no loud noises, lest they be evicted. Then she leaves, and but for Akira's savvy they are on their own. How could she possibly leave? Will she return? Where did she go? Nobody knows. Akira shops, cooks, banks at the ATM, tracks down his dad to beg for money, and cares for his siblings, as we watch the sad and inevitable meltdown of the four children. The film was inspired by a true story that was reported in Tokyo not too long ago. In Japanese with English subtitles.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I was very pleased with having the whole series at my fingertips - especially no commercial interuptions! <br /> <br />I would suggest anyone interested in the themes Alias purports buy this collection.
B0000640VO|4.0|Amelie Poulain, a waitress at a Paris cafe, grew up with \\"a neurotic mother (who committed suicide) and an iceberg father,\\" so she withdrew into her imaginative and shy self. She finds her gift, which is to bestow joy and serendipity upon the least suspecting people through creatively contrived circumstances--her apartment concierge, a blind man, and even her father. At first whimsical, light hearted and winsome, the film takes a final, poignant turn when Amelie must learn to accept love and joy for herself. Amelie earned five Oscar nominations.
B000002IWH|5.0|I am both a music and movie fan (as most people are) and all I have to say about this soundtrack is that it is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.  Enough said.  The cd speaks for itself.  If you don't have it, buy it.  There will be no regrets.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I would strongly recommend this series. I only give if 4 stars because I am not a fan of the past-is-future style -- you know, planets or aliens who resemble the wild west or ancient Egypt or knights and sorcery, that sort of thing. There is a little too much of the \\"wild west\\" feel to some of the episodes, but overall, likeable characters and interesting storylines.
B00004W50T|5.0|muchas COSAS se han dicho acerca de este disco, del lugar donde fue grabado...que clapton se fue de cream despues de escucharlo..y que se yo cuantas locuras mas...lo unico veradero y realmente palpable es la autenticidad, simpleza, frescura y dejadez que emana cada tema de esta maravillosa placa...tipos crudos, problematicos, maduros, sin asesores de imagen, se refugiaron solamente en la musica y dieron catedra con un disco que desde un sotano alcanzo la nube que ocultaba a BOB DYLAN....ESCUCHALO POR FAVOR!
074356619X|5.0|I can not recommend \\"The Secret\\" highly enough.  I came across it when the DVD was recommended by several friends... I saw the DVD, was awestruck and naturally was hungry for more. The audio book sure did deliver!!!  The speakers on this CD are world class and the theories, recommendations and science are cutting edge and sound.... dont hesitate... you have nothing to lose ..  It is all gain... Watch the DVD and listen to the CD... SPECTACULAR!!!

B00001U0DP|4.0|The Italian director Roberto Benigni stars in his own film as Guido, a Jewish hotel waiter who with his son Joshua are loaded on to trains and taken to the death camps. It is all a humorous game, he insists to Joshua. Controversy swirled around this film with its use of humor to survive the Holocaust. Life is beautiful because the worse human evil cannot crush the human spirit.
B000060OFT|3.0|While the 1996 remake of \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" was a bold attempt to update Shakespeare, the original play is far superior in many ways.  The filmmakers had the right idea, yet they attempted to re-create something that didn't need to be fixed.  However, the filmmakers are not to blame for there is really no way that it could've gone well.  It is a classic play that needs to take place in a classical setting for it to retain validity. <br /> The refashioning of the story took away from its emotional value.  Case and point, the use of modern-day weapons changes the focus of the scene from the characters' actions onto the weapons themselves.  Moments that contained beautiful simplicity were ruined by the over-produced attempt to modernize the story.  Again, these changes distract the viewer from the story, and force attention on the aesthetics.  In another example, the emotional heft of the final death scene was diminished by the bright, flashy graves.  Ironically, moments that could have used modernization from the original text were cut entirely out of the film.  For example, the Queen Mab monologue was significantly cut to keep the interest of the audience. <br /> Despite their bold attempt, the makers of the '96 Romeo & Juliet made a sub-par film.  I do not blame them at all; this film shouldn't have been made in the first place.  In order to capture the spirit of this story set in the early 1600's, it would need to have been set in that time period.  Sadly, we will never get positive or negative feedback from its author.  However, I am relatively sure that William Shakespeare would be utterly confused about what his creation has turned into. <br />
B0000AZAUM|5.0|This well produced, quality CD will not disappoint you or tarnish your memories of this timeless classic. Each song deftly draws you in, better than when you first heard it (and probably had no idea of just how really good it all was). This CD brings it all back and more - if there is but one ember of your youth left inside - you know you have to have this CD.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|These guys are just plan cool.The music they put out is hard blues and rock.It's Perfect for the crap thats put out in todays so called music seen,and there even ten times better live. If you like real raw music this CD is for you.If not then why put them down because it's not what you expected.If you want some watered down music it's out there waiting for you.I'll stick to this because it's as close to the real deal as your gonna get in this day and age.
B000A6T262|5.0|I was pleasently surprised by the full set of special edition discs.  The set was purchased as a gift for my father.  I already own most of the movies, the TNG in their non-special versions.  The bonus material is standard, not really needed for people who just like the movies, but more appropriate for those who would be tagged as Trekkies.
0739308742|1.0|I'm an artist and I love listening to audio books while I draw but this one is simply impossible. I can't listen to it. For those of you who don't know, the first 3 books were read by Roy Dotrice while this one was read by John Lee, a man whose very name reflects the mediocrity of his performance.    I didn't realize how amazing Roy  Dotrice was until I started the first disc of this. This man is horrible. I know a lot of people will be polite and say something like \\"It's not that Lee is so awful, it's just that Dotrice was so good.\\"     Not quite.     This is horrendous. He reads this work of art as if his listeners have all killed his mother and he has decided he will punish them by reading in the most over dramatic, camp-fire ghost story voice I have ever heard. It's not just that it's melodramatic, it's that it's melodramatic at the wrong places, as if the man has never heard of plot and character development and emotional turmoil and is trying to replicate them with some bizarre calculation that is very departed than what we humans experience. Not to mention that so many of the characters are simply indistinguishable whereas in the Dotrice reading he not only gives the characters different voices but people from the same regions and same families SPEAK SIMILARLY. Tyrion and Jamie actually sound like brothers!    I pity the person who listens to audiobooks because they have no other choice because this would be incomprehensible without my hard copy at hand. Not even not even a quarter through and I gave up and set it aside in angry, nerd disgust. In the end I had to kidnap someone, tie them to a chair and force them to read it to me aloud. This was very troublesome.
B00003CWL6|3.0|This film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but I thought it was weak. Every character in the film is pathologically dysfunctional, but the bad part is that they are superficial, predictable, and unbelievable stereotypes. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), age 42, is a loser, and he knows he is a loser. His wife and teenage daughter hate him, for good reasons. Not to worry, he rejuvenates himself by seducing Angela, his daughter's best friend, quitting his job, working out and drinking smoothies, listening to Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan, smoking dope, throwing dishes against the wall, getting a new job at Smiley's Hamburgers, and buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird. Self destruction as personal makeover? Life is beautiful, as he proclaims at the end of the film? Yeah, right. His wife Carolyn is an obsessive phony who lives only for image and finds her own authenticity by bedding her chief real estate competitor. Daughter Jane runs off with the next door classmate, Ricky, a drug dealing voyeur who spent two years in a mental hospital because of his abusive Marine Colonel dad who wrongly thinks he is gay, even while, apparently, he himself is gay. The real, token gay couple lives a few houses down. Just your average suburban neighborhood. Mid life crises are not funny, and it is too bad that director Sam Mendes did not help Lester deal with his in an interesting or compelling way.

B000JJRIN4|4.0|One of the things I really like about Gwen Stefani is that she isn't afraid to push her creativity to the limit. \\"The Sweet Escape\\"  is (in my opinion) very different than her first album. This time around,the \\"Harajuku Girl\\" has decided to let go and \\"Wind It Up\\". (After all,she can't be known as  the Harajuku Girl forever if she wants to stay on top.) There are some great songs on this cd. There is also a greater variety of musical styles on this album as well. You will hear reggae,some rock, ballads,dance music, and even a touch of the 1950's updated to sound like 2007!! I also like how she samples  bits from broadway songs and updates the arrangements. (What a great way to inspire  kids to  want to discover the ORIGINAL broadway versions of these songs!)  <br />     When you listen to this album expect to have a different experience than you did with \\"Love,Angel,Music Baby\\" (her first cd). \\"Sweet Escape\\" is definitely worth purchasing. It's a good album that will appeal to people who enjoy a wider  variety of musical styles.
0618680004|5.0|I haven't written a book review since high school but felt compelled to write one about Richard Dawkin's landmark book.  In my opinion, this book should be required reading for every student, especially home schooled students as it could open their mind from the sometimes comforting but often dangerous fantasy of religion.      I won't reiterate Dawkin's points in this review but will point out that they are written and defended in a solid, scientific and understandable way.  Unfortunately, as Dawkins points out, he is probably preaching to the choir in this book.  The people that really should read it won't as they don't like to have their faith challenged.    The people that do read this book will have more understanding of the atheist viewpoint and may be moved, as I was, to talk more openly about it with others.   Already I have learned that several of my co-workers are at best agnostic if not flat out atheist and just keep it to themselves for fear of being discriminated against.      I can't say that this book changed my life, as I have been an atheist since about the age of 12, but I can say it made me feel ok about it and ok to talk to others about it. Open communication is the key to continue the \\"Rational Thinking\\" movement and to try, in our own little way, to help society free itself from the dangers of religion as well as strive for truth not fantasy.
B00005JKN9|5.0|With all of the Oscar hype concerning the newly released \\"The Departed\\" you might forget that our boy, Marty, has already directed the best Irish Gangster movie of all time:  \\"Gangs of New York\\".  Notable for having a talented Irishman playing American and a talented American playing Irish (how's that for creative juxtoposition?) it is a gritty, wrenching, and incredibly realistic depiction of a city struggling through it's bloody growing pains.<br /><br />  The film portrays the unique structure of Old World style tribal sensibilities superimposed on an emerging modern Industrial nation.<br /><br />  Basically, you are seeing a charming but antiquated clannish way of life being replaced by by a national super-structure - and all of the resulting carnage.<br /><br />  I've never seen this topic tackled before - and I can't imagine that it will ever be done better.  This is a wholly unique story and theme.  It is, in a word, Amazing.
B00005JOLI|1.0|i thought this was the worst movie i have seen in a while. maybe if i hadnt read the books it would have seemed better. i understand the book has to be shortened to make it into a movie but comeon now. so many important parts and people were cut out... it was cool effects but poor planning of the plot
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Edward Bloom is dying, and his son Will, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, dearly wants to know just who his enigmatic father really is. The problem is that Dad was a blowhard storyteller who talked about things he did not do and did not talk about things he did do (\\"we never talked about not talking\\"). He was a combination of the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, very charming and very fake, and so Will laments, \\"I have no idea who you are.\\" But maybe Will has misread his dad, and all the stories are true in some sense. The overall theme of Big Fish is thus entirely poignant, but the metaphors mix rather badly with humor, surreal scenes of giants, witches, crows in dreams who prophesy death, etc., and an extended love story about Mom and Dad. This good film could have been better if the visual medium had not overwhelmed the otherwise rich plot potential.
B000002MUN|5.0|This album came out when I was a sophomore in high school back in 1993-94, and I had a musical epiphany of sorts. At that time, I was aware of Tom Petty but this record broadsided me like a brickwall and suddenly I began to explore his remarkable musical legacy. More than a decade later, this album is still close to my heart and has guided me through various periods of my life. Simply put, this is a cd that absolutely no Tom Petty fan should be without. Some of TP's greatest tunes are on this cd-\\"It's Good to Be King\\" which has some of his most poignant lyrics: \\"I'll be king when dogs get wings, can I help it if I dream from time to time.\\" Other classics include the title-track, a truly beautiful love song, the perennial live track \\"You Wreck Me\\", and also one of my personal favorites, \\"To Find a Friend\\": \\"And the days went by like paper in the wind, everything changed, and then changed again, it's hard to find a friend.\\" I also had the rare pleasure to hear Tom play \\"Crawling Back to You\\" live in 2005, which suggests that it is one of his favorite tunes. The last track on the album, \\"Wake Up Time,\\" an introspective piece featuring piano and strings, is a profound song that asks:  <   \\"You spend you life dreaming, running around in a trance  You hang out forever and still miss the dance  And if you get lucky, you might find someone  To help you get over the pain that will come  Yeah, you were so cool back in high school, what happened?\\"    I guess we're all still wondering what has happened, and where the time goes, and if we make the most of the opportunities life gives us.   Buy this album today: it will change your life!!
0736041850|5.0|Of all my books on weight training and muscle building Strength Training Anatomy (STA) is my favorite and most referenced. The incredibly clear and detailed illustrations of the bodies muscles allowed me to actually learn which exercises build which muscles. And although their are 7 major muscle groups there are many muscles within each group and STA makes it fun to learn those muscles and thier names, especially when you can look at the muscle while working it and reqognizing which one it is, for the first time! STA lists all the muscles in awesome detail, showing you clearly which muscles are worked with each exercise. The book allowed me to build my workouts using a wide range of exercises to target a wide range of muscles and to create a balance of exercises. You simply won't go wrong when you buy this book if your serious about muscle building of any kind.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Agree with many of the other reviewers who said this is the best Al Gore has ever presented himself.  He comes across very human.  The vignettes about his sister's death and his son's accident are moving and reveal what's important to him.  It's a masterful presentation of data.  If you aren't convinced that at least there is a problem, then you are seriously in hardcore denial.
B000000W6R|4.0|These B-sides sound better than 95% of the band's other output. Maybe it's because these songs don't suffer from the over-production of the band's other output (eg, \\"Melancholy...\\"??? Give me a break. What an over-blown, over-produced, snooze-fest). \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" is by far the best CD the band ever put out. <br /> <br />From the pummeling \\"Frail and Bedazzled\\" to the lilting \\"Obscured\\" to the majestic \\"Starla\\", there isn't a single weak moment on this CD. It's amazing these songs didn't make the cut for SP's prior CD's. The fact that \\"Starla\\" was a show-stopper whenever it was performed speaks for itself. <br /> <br />In fact, if you want a top-quality SP collection, buy this CD and download \\"Cherub Rock\\" (from Siamese Dream) and the full-length version of \\"Drown\\" from the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack (with complete feedback solo at the end). You can skip the rest and you won't miss much of anything.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Pai, a 12-year old Maori girl in remote New Zealand, is raised by her deeply angry grandfather who wants to pass on the traditions of his tribal culture and history, but must face the realities of a modernizing world. But the tables are turned when Pai teaches him and becomes the new leader. Exquisite scenery and a powerful story, I took my teenage daughter and girlfriends after seeing it with my wife.
0393327655|2.0|In The End of Faith, Sam Harris tackles the challenging question of religion vs reason in today's world. As a secular humanist who rejects the supernatural and the spiritual, I expected to find the book compelling. If anything, I was afraid that Harris would be \\"preaching to the choir.\\" <br /> <br />To the contrary, while Harris' book is thought provoking, in the end I found his argument unconvincing and, at times, simply offensive. Rather than examining the roots of religions, and fleshing out stereotypes, and challenging both, he simply seems to embrace some of the most offensive stereotypes (Muslims as terrorists, believers of all faiths as tragically absurd, etc.). The author is so quick to argue against tolerance for religions (a fascinating argument as non-believers are quick to say blithely, \\"it's not for me, but it's ok for you\\"), his fundamental intolerance seems to have blinded him to the dynamics at work. By dismissively comparing faith to aliens manipulating our thoughts (among many wild arguments), Harris does both religion and his own examination a great disservice.  <br /> <br />In any encounter it is wise to understand one's enemy: Harris is too dismissive of religions and consequently misses many key dimensions. In short, this was an interesting but ultimately flawed book.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Possibly the worst movie I have seen! I hated it so much and my favorite actor is in it. No not Brad Pitt, Gael Garcia Bernal. Not even the sight of him can save the movie! Ugh. It was so gross. The asian girl naked in every single scene for no reason. The morracan boy doing something to gross to type about. Brad's scenes were boring. I really hated this movie. I couldn't wait to leave the theater and I still want my money back.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|The little girl Abigail Breslin will steal your heart.  You just cannot help but fall in love with her - she is so innocent and vulnerable and beautiful on the inside.  But the rest of the movie is pretty boring.  No laugh out loud moments until the very end.  The rest of the cast wasn't bad, but hard to believe most of the time.  Many of the gags are recycled from other movies like Vacation.  Steve Carrell is a comic genius, but he does nothing in this movie.  I would definitely skip it.  Most definitely do not buy it - you won't watch more than once.
1569242739|5.0|There's NO reason to make cakes or cupcakes with eggs, butter and milk.  This book is proof.  When I got mine I was suprised it was as thick as it was, I was imagining a book with a lot less pages.  This thing is PACKED whith TONS of color photos and recipes.  hot damn. <br />Also there's a much appreciated \\"Troubleshooting\\" guide so if your first cupcake outing goes wrong, just look up the symptom and find the cause!  My \\"Cookies and Cream\\" cupcakes turned out perfect though, and I was generally suprised how fast you can actually whip up an amazing batch of cupcakes from scratch!
B000E8N690|4.0|As with the movie Ray, I would think that it would be difficult to make a dull film about such a larger than life figure as Johnny Cash. Beginning with the trauma-inducing death of his brother Jack in rural Arkansas, his overbearing father who blamed him for his brother's death, a tour in Germany with the Air Force where he wrote his first song, and his self-destructive addictions, the film takes us to Cash's eventual marriage proposal to June Carter on stage in Canada. Carter and her parents, for all practical purposes, saved Cash's life and career. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon (who won an Oscar for best actress for her performance) sing Cash's songs; no voice-over lip syncs here. My only disappointment with this film, like the film Ray, is that it ends while Cash is still a young man. He only got better with age. Others have complained that the film makes almost no mention of Cash's rather outspoken Christian faith. But these are minor quibbles about a good film about a great man and musician.
B0000844MS|5.0|My children & I have loved this movie for years...It also has all the songs written & performed by Mr. Bowie himself...excellent!
B00097DX3U|4.0|Not as good as their first album, but better than the 2006 album.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I don't normally like this type of movie, and I only went to see it because my work rented a theater for us for a day and this happened to be playing.  I am SO GLAD I saw it!  You couldn't ask for a better cast.  After this, I want to see every movie Leonardo DeCaprio stars in!  I even went to see it a second time and am pre-ordering the DVD (and I very rarely ever buy DVDs!).  Others that I talked to that saw it thought it was gory, but I did not think it was that bad at all - and believe me, I am not one to watch gory movies!  So if you've heard that about this movie, please don't let it stop you from seeing it.
B000EOTTV8|4.0|In a remarkable performance that reminded me of Charlize Theron's transformation into Eileen Wuernos, Felicity Huffman plays a transsexual man named Bree who is a few days shy of having his male-to-female sexual reassignment surgery. When she discovers that she fathered a son long ago, her therapist will not sign off for the surgery until she confronts her past, so Bree travels to New York City and meets her son Toby. Toby is a street prostitute and drug abuser who aspires to make porn movies in Los Angeles. Bree poses as a missionary sort, and the two of them take a way-too-long and boring road trip from New York to California. This film did not work for me for many reasons. The relationship between Toby and Bree was not believable, nor was the film's ending. But Huffman's portrayal does an incredible job of capturing the pain, emotional isolation, and confusion of a person who lives in this nether world of unspoken taboos. She is intelligent, modest, deferential, homely, and has no interest in making any political statement. Why has this film been billed as a comedy? Anyone who has experienced these very real life issues would not find any of it laughable.
B00081MUY0|5.0|Other reviewers have delineated the technical brilliance of this album. I would not have much to add or subtract from their observations, except to  affirm that the clarity of the mix enabled me to hear things I had never heard before, which injected new life into some well-worn tracks. The rest of my comments will be unapologetically subjective, possibly because Donovan has an odd way of reaching each individual at a personal level, though his stance is usually an acerbic but kindly, somewhat detached observer.  In the musical firmament of the '60s, Donovan was the Pleiades, the mystic purple star system where faerie visions came and went, suggesting spiritual and sensual doings of an evanescent and yet intense character. On this Celtic point count, no one else was even close. If \\"Purple Haze\\" was the pile driver version of the grail at the end of that quest, \\"Sunshine Superman\\" was the lyrical version.  Funny thing is, Donovan's songs still take you there, if you let them. I grew up in the SF Bay Area, and the Flower Power movement (if you could call it a \\"movement\\") emerged about the time I got my driver's license. I went in search of it, borrowing my parents' car. (Incidentally, the term \\"Flower Power\\" was coined by a reviewer of a Donovan concert who noted the flowers he tossed to the audience.) Maybe I found a little piece of the dream one fine day with a girl who seemed to know the power of silence, but for the most part it was illusion. I wanted to believe, but reality kept conflicting.  Then I attended a Donovan concert at the Fillmore. For that two-hour moment, which was actually of infinite duration, it all came true. Like the gateway to the Pied Piper's Kingdom, the door is now nothing but a rock wall, but it is hard to forget having been among the elves for a moment, and the one who played the pipes that transported me there.  Donovan's music suggested the beauty possible in a '60s mindset, and no album suggests it better than \\"Sunshine Superman.\\" Thinkwhat a miracle it was to hear so much groundbreaking, diverse, and original music exploding all at once, and here was this guy singing songs that fitted it all perfectly, and yet didn't belong in any one stylistic camp or category at all. This quality of poetic vision and independence from convention still comes through today, surprisingly. Donovan's music brushes off the dust that tried to collect on its robes, and keeps on walkin', shimmering and catching the dreamlight.  There is no absolute definitive interpretation of any of the songs. I think that's what you'll like about them. They're like kaleidoscope images that attract different parts of your soul on different days. Some of it is silly, and yet overall there's something profound about it. There are classics on this CD, such as \\"Sunshine Superman\\" and \\"Season of the Witch.\\" But there are some underrated wonders here, too, such as \\"Bert's Blues,\\" which is kind of a jazz/pop soliloquy on the \\"To Be or Not To Be\\" question.  I will always be nostalgic for a belief in Peace and Love, even if the dream is deader than JFK, RFK, and MLK. But maybe another place and time? If you were there, you know what I mean. If you weren't, this might be your ticket. And if this isn't a five-star experience, then what is?
B0001WTWCO|1.0|The best parts of this film were the minute-long landscape shots, free of dialog and narrative.  At those points you could almost forget the absolute dullness of every character and plot aspect.<br /><br />Contrary to the gushing of the majority, this is not even a love story so much as it is a celebration of selfishness and treating others poorly.  Don't let the WWII period piece propaganda fool you on this.  Granted, I turned it off after 1.5 hours out of sheer dread and boredom, so maybe this flaming sack of doo redeemed itself in the last hour.
0393061434|3.0|iWoz is a fascinating view inside the head of Steve Wozniak.  The text includes lots of information about things he did alone, but gives little insight into his relationships with other people, besides his Dad.  The handful of anecdotes about people are almost always stories in which other people apparently took advantage of him (talk about holding grudges!).  Despite this, the details of his technical achievements are fascinating, and anyone interested in circuit board design and the history of computers will enjoy the book.  It would have been nice if he'd included circuit diagrams or something to illustrate his descriptions, however.  I would have enjoyed more information about his time at Apple between the early days and when he left-- he talks more about his junior high science projects. <br /> <br />All in all, the book doesn't paint the best picture of Woz-- his bragging gets old, and his life seemed to lose focus after the Apple II, but it does give an interesting view of this brilliant, but flawed man.  Its a quick read, too.

0240808452|5.0|I was in search of a good figure drawing book with an emphasis on animation and comics and this one caught my eye. After reading through, practicing the techniques and understanding them, I'm convinced that this is the most invaluable book I have in my large collection of art books. <br /> <br />This book completely changed the way I draw. I've been drawing seriously for roughly 10 years and once the ideas in this book clicked, it made me feel as if I'd been drawing the wrong way for all those years. Well worth the 17 bucks or whatever it was I payed for it. <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend this book to beginners however. It's not really a how to draw or a book that covers basic proportion and anatomy issues. For somebody to get the most out of this book, I think they'd need to have a solid grasp on anatomy and fundamental drawing techniques. On the other hand, a beginner may benefit from this book simply from a gesture standpoint. <br /> <br />Easily a 5 out of 5 for me.
B00005JPCD|5.0|Gah, what is with all the people who are saying the latter half makes it 'not a kid's movie'? I suppose \\"All Dogs Go To Heaven\\" isn't a kid's movie either, considering the debauchery in that film. As far as over-bearing ecological messages go, it's no worse than \\"Fern Gully\\". (Perhaps I should add that I saw both movies when I was a kid, and loved them both to bits.) <br /> <br />Ultimately, I am inclined to call \\"Happy Feet\\" a movie about aliens and communication: about bridging the gap between Us and They Who Are Not Like Us. From the recognition of the \\"untalented\\" Mumble's genious feet, to the realization of the existance other entities that deserve acknowledgement. This is what Happy Feet is really about.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|My daughters were enchanted with this movie as well as the sound track.  So romantic!
B000683VI4|3.0|If you can suspend almost all critical judgment and subscribe to a Hollywood tear jerk formula, then this film might work for you. About 80% of The Notebook  is a flashback to the 1940s and the improbable summer romance between Allie Nelson and Noah Calhoun that led to their marriage. She is from fabulous wealth; he works at the lumberyard for pennies. Surprise--her mother objects! But they canoe in sunsets, splash in the rain, separate for years, coincidentally find each other many years later, leave the respective people they love, and all through the power of a house Noah restored. In the present day, an elderly Noah reads this story aloud to his now demented Allie from a notebook she had written. The mere reading cures her of Alzheimer's, at least long enough for them to die in each other's arms. Sorry, it does not work for me. Much more interesting would have been an exploration of an aging couple still in love, or about that long interlude between a summer fling and death's doorstep; how does a couple keep the flame alive? This film cheats both ends with sugary sentimentality and leaves the middle passage unexplored.
B00008CMR6|5.0|Rio Lobo was the swan's song of Howard Hawks. And you may realize how the personages are handled with such accurate blend of humanity, tenderness, kind manners and a good taste loaded of farewell.<br /><br />The dialogues are incisive and snappy, John Wayne is an old wolf who will put order in a town submitted by an abominable gang with the consent of a corrupt sheriff.<br /><br />And the rest of the plot runs for you. Under any circumstance you should not miss this unforgettable and very touching Western.

B0002DB52M|4.0|In this much-maligned film, the Danish writer and director Lars von Trier paints a dark portrait of the human spirit in both its communal and individual dimensions. He suggests that lurking beneath our veneer of social respectability, and even our best of intentions, there is something wild and dangerous deep in the human heart. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a fugitive on the run from gangsters who seeks refuge in Dogville, a tiny town of fifteen people set in the Colorado Rockies at the turn of the century. At first petty, suspicious, and insular, after a two-week trial the citizens loosen up and provide Grace the haven she seeks. But eventually the town turns on her, viciously, despite the many ways she has served them. Grace forgives them, the victim blaming herself, and then later undergoes her own moral transformation and exacts vicious retribution. The victim becomes the new oppressor. This film watches more like a movie of a play. The entire production takes place on one, large sound stage. The town streets, bushes, etc., are mere chalk lines. The houses are sparse frames without doors. John Hurt narrates the successive \\"chapters.\\" At 177 minutes, the film is long. Critics tended either to love or hate this film, but either way, von Trier is far and away one of the most important film makers today, so it is always interesting to see his latest creation.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Bought on vinyl when it first came out.  Truly a Stones fan at heart.
B000002NHN|5.0|First I have to say a huge THANK YOU to all the previous reviewers of this CD. I was looking for gregorian chant the other day which led somehow to reviews of Celtic music and then I came across the 440+ reviews of this magical woman's music. I thought that if one singer could garner so much praise and enthuisiasm, then there must be something special about her! I'd never heard of Loreena McKinnett or any of her music before last week when I ordered this CD, but I have not stopped listening to it since; I actually listened to the whole CD one morning three times in a row! I did not know what to expect when I heard the first note of the Prologue, but I was immediately hooked and transported to another world. I am a bit of dreamer and romantic so this music fits my mindset perfectly. It is soothing, haunting, imaginative and beautiful. I love all the influences that I hear in each song, but to me there is definitely an overall Celtic feel to the music. From some of the reviews I thought I would have to get over my wariness of Middle Eastern music which tends to sound the same to me, but the blend of Celtic and Middle Eastern works wonderfully. It's 10 years since this CD first came out and I'm only discovering it for the first time, but I have to say the music is timeless which, given the various themes in some of the songs, is fitting. I love all kinds of music - my tastes range from Kate Bush to Earth Wind & Fire and everything else in between - but Loreena's music is a welcome addition to my CD collection. She's opened me up to a whole new appreciation of sound and imagery. I look forward to seeing her PBS special in March and listening/experiencing more of her music.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|I was looking forward to this movie as I have been a big fan of Iron Man for years. It started off really well.. the story was updated to modern times ok... I was disappointed in thier decision to waste a lot of time on the four elementals with so many great characters in the '5000 character library' that Marvel keeps bragging about... the dragon could have been Fin Fang Foom.. but it was't... Mandarin was some bizarre gender bending mystical spirit.. and where were the 10 rings? Overuse of the clunky gray armour, not enough red and gold... <br /> <br />They took too much liberty with the history. Maybe its my fault for having been a fan for too long and knowing too much of his history.. but so much change just for the sake of change isn't always a wise choice. <br /> <br />I can only hope it does well enough to warrant a decent sequel.. (not a disappointing one like Avengers 2) Focus on proven fun story lines like the Armor Wars, or some decent espionage stuff.. c'mon guys.. don't let us down. <br /> <br />Good attempt... hoping for way more from the live action movie. <br />thanks :-)
B000E33VWW|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as the (in)famous writer Truman Capote (1924-1984) in one of the best films of the year, despite the problems of viewer identification that it might provoke. In researching his \\"non-fiction novel\\" In Cold Blood Capote befriended a young man who was convicted and eventually executed for the brutal murder of a Kansas family of four. The portrait of Capote that emerges is of a flamboyant artistic genius whose deeply complex personality reveals itself in decidedly mixed motives. He attracts, repels and fascinates us, all at the same time. In the film Capote befriends the young prisoner Perry Smith for at least four conflicting reasons. Capote was egotistical, vain, narcissistic, condescending and ambitious. Several times he lied to Smith in order to exploit him for selfish, professional purposes in writing his book. When asked if he \\"esteemed\\" Smith, Capote replies, \\"he's a gold mine.\\" Second, Capote's gay lover Jack jealously accused him of falling in love with Smith, which also seems to be true. Third, interviewing Smith evoked powerful memories of his own childhood that resulted in an obsessive act of self-identification and emotional attachment with him: \\"it's as if we grew up in the same house, but he went out the front door and I went out the back.\\" These memories include exclusion as an outsider, family suicide, alcoholism, and parental abandonment. Finally, Capote genuinely empathized for the young death row inmate, and the film provokes themes of social justice revolving around our penal system and pity for a criminal with a horrible childhood. Smith is not a monster, he insists, and Capote intends his book to \\"return him to the realm of humanity.\\" Still, Capote chose not to do all that he might have to save Smith; he even wanted Smith to die to supply an ending for his book. When the film ends we learn that In Cold Blood remained an unfinished novel, and that it was the last book that Capote ever wrote, even though he lived anothereighteen years. Badly missing in this remarkable film--the slightest mention of the murdered victims and their families. Capote won five Academy Award nominations.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The story flowed well and the actors seemed to fit their parts.  <br />\\"Creepers\\" played by Jonathan Breck was totally fantastic! He's an impressive actor with the ability to invoke both fear and humor from the audience. Creepers' house of pain was really creepy to say the least...this movie is great especially if you love movies about gargoyles or other unusual supernatural creatures. I give this movie 5 stars - it's awesome!
B000J103PC|4.0|One of the better movies I have watched recently, this film managed to pull off dead serious and uproariously funny at the same time, and most importantly, kept me entertained throughout. <br /> <br />Anne Hathaway is both vulnerably awkward and gorgeous at the same time as she stumbles her way through her employment with the ever-demanding Meryl Streep as her boss.  Stanley Tucci also adds some tragi-comic flair to the mix, and the supporting cast supports without getting in the way. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the film resonated with me well because its underlying theme is work-life balance, an issue with which I struggle on a daily basis.  The gag reel was also amusing, and the deleted scenes contained some interesting material that didn't make the final cut. <br /> <br />The only thing keeping this from getting a resounding 5 stars is pacing.  While I was consistently entertained by the film, the filmmakers could have shaved another 10 minutes from the film and further tightened it without the viewer missing anything.  The most effective sequences are the quick-cut portions showing the day-to-day similarities of Meryl Streep's systematic abuse of power, and in my opinion, several longer sequences could have been similarly intercut as a sort of \\"running gag,\\" which would have increased the comedic effect and shortened a movie whose premise wears out its welcome slightly before the denouement.   <br /> <br />Otherwise, a very entertaining film with a fine cast.

B00065MDSG|5.0|\\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" is King Crimson's aspiring masterwork from 1973. By this time, the band had gone through nearly half a dozen line-up changes in less than four years with guitarist Robert Fripp being the only mainstay through it all. In late 1972, Fripp hit upon something special when he assembled a fresh new line up to record this album. The line-up of Fripp, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, violinist David Cross, drummer Bill Bruford (who had recently left Yes) and percussionist Jaime Muir (who would leave King Crimson shortly after this album was made) became the band's second classic configuration and would create what many would consider the best material under the King Crimson band name.<br /><br />\\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" is bookended by its lengthy instrumental title track. The first part which opens the album is a nearly 14-minute tour-de-force which combines free-form experimentalism with jazz-fusion, classical and even heavy metal influences. It's quite extraordinary that the band can combine these many genres into one piece of music and still sound coherent.<br /><br />\\"Book Of Saturday\\" is a simple 3-minute ballad which is quite the opposite of the previous track. Although King Crimson has never been a singles band, this track would have worked out great as one. It's melodic guitar parts and soaring vocal work from Wetton suit this songs contemplative mood.<br /><br />The 8-minute \\"Exiles\\" sounds as if were an outtake from the first King Crimson album \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\". John Wetton's vocals have a sound reminiscent of Greg Lake while Fripp's guitar and mellotron work are straight out of \\"Epitaph\\" from the aforementioned album. Cross adds a definite Classical influence with his violin playing and also plays flute on this track (though it's not credited. Wetton also plays uncredited piano).<br /><br />The latter half of this album is considered by many to be its most memorable as it includes the timeless Crimson classics \\"Easy Money\\", \\"The Talking Drum\\" and the second part of \\"Larks'\\" title track.<br /><br />\\"Easy Money\\" has a slight blues influence and deep groove which leads into a solid group improvisation. Fripp gives a wrenching guitar lead here while Muir litters the track with various percussion abstractions and noises.<br /><br />\\"Easy Money\\" leads into \\"The Talking Drum\\" which is a giant 7-minute crescendo beginning at an extremely low volume but builds until the track is literally screaming from the speakers. This track is a solid demonstration of the band's tight musicianship. Bruford, Muir and Wetton lock into a repeated rhythm pattern which Cross and Fripp improvise over. As the track reaches its peak, it cuts into a brief snatch of violin and guitar screeching which leads directly into the next and final track, \\"Larks' Tongues Part 2\\".<br /><br />\\"Larks' Tongues Part 2\\" has remained an active part of King Crimson's live repertoire since it was initially released on this album. Like the previous track, \\"Larks' Part 2\\" shows of the bands high-class musicianship and their ability to stick together through radical dynamics and time signatures. Everyone in the band is in top musical form here. And you just gotta love that `trash-can' ending to this track.<br /><br />With all due respect, \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" is King Crimson's second magnum-opus (the first being \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\") and is an essential classic for fans and musicians alike. The powerful musicianship and experimentation of this band is unparalleled. All of the King Crimson line-up's have had great musicians in them however, as mentioned at the beginning of this review, Robert Fripp did something special when he assembled the \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" line-up in 1972.

B000H6SXMY|4.0|(The 4 Star ranking is for the show itself. If they hadn't completely emascualted Chandler after marriage and therefore silenced their best character, it would have been 5 stars. I know little about this collection, ergo my question.)    I've seen it alluded to within the reviews, but never stated directly, so I was hoping someone could answer the following:    Does THIS collection (the red-boxed, six sleeved version) have anything MISSING that might be found in either the individual seasons OR the previous Plexi-box release? Obviously, there are specific packaging differences, including both the physical box(es) and any inside booklets. And, I'm aware that both versions have the complete episodic collection. What I'm wondering is if THIS version has the exact same commentary tracks, fun puff piece documentaries, deleted scenes, etc...     In essence, is THIS version going to give me (VIEWING wise) the exact same extras(or perhaps MORE) that the earlier versions had?    Most of my DVDs get transferred into portable CD books, so, as much as I would choose the original box set in regards to the packaging, it isn't worth it to me if I will be watching the exact same EXTRAS.    Thanks in advance to any who answer.

B00005JPLU|5.0|For that is what this movie is about..and from what I've seen in the trailers it is a fantastic rendering of FM's graphic novel.  In anticipation of this movie I read Steven Pressfield's GATES OF FIRE and viewed the movie 300 SPARTANS from 1961, also there is a terrific PBS program available called THE SPARTANS.  If nothing else it has added greatly to my knowledge of this ancient warrior culture.  Add it all together with Gerry Butler as Leonidas, Lena Headley as Gorgo and David Wenham as Delios, it looks like a terrific movie! Counting down the days until March 9th!
B000IHY9UW|5.0|I have the Stone Complete Boxed Set (full set) - and this movie is not anamorphic or even what they call \\"enhanced for 16x9\\" TVs.  So when you play it, bars not only appear on the top and bottom (not as a big deal) - but they do on the sides as well (this is BAD)...so you have to zoom it to fill out the 16 x 9 TVs.    Supposedly the 2DVD Doors special edition that came out in 1997 (orange) - said it was anamorphic this time, but is it true this was not really the case as everyone found out?    And so - does anyone know if this new edition (purple) is truly amamorphic or enhanced for 16x9 TVs.  I know it isn't HD, but anamorphic...you know what I mean?    thanks!      UPDATE for FEBRUARY 20th!!! - it IS TRUE ANAMORPHIC!!!  Thanks!!!

B0002858YS|3.0|The title says basically what my review will echo.. The Killers show great promise with the debut work. When their songs are good on here, they are awesome and deserve a 5, yet some of the songs are a little crude and struggle to stay consistent with the top songs.. I try to wait for a group to have a sophmore album to see where they are headed and where they came from before making my mind up about a group.. So check out my review of Sams Town to see what I meant. As for Hot Fuss, it deserves a 3 and a half, but definitely not a 4.. I dont think its fair to even give them bonus points for creating other groups that sound similar.. The Killers are a good group, and their first album was above par and worthy of being bought if only to warm you up for Sams Town.. Enjoy!
B00062IDCO|4.0|Wake up Paramount! Take a cue from your sales on the STTNG sets. Now that you have finally come to your senses and dropped the prices on the sets to where they should have been in the FIRST PLACE, I would imagine that all of the hold-outs (like me) are now buying them.<br /><br />See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a fair market price of $25-35. So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range. So, $60 is your sweet spot.<br /><br />You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop. So, do us all a favor and fire your marketing and sales people, drop the price to where it is supposed to be, and earn your sales. Nobody sane is going to pay more than $60 for a season of an hour long/episode TV show on DVD, period!

B00005JPC7|5.0|This truly original and creative story is told with dry wit, great acting, and characters that inspire my interest. The mood of the movie is offbeat and 'odd' from start to end. I loved it. The author and IRS agent are great characters, as is Dustin Hoffman's english professor character, but what really steals this show is the affectingly pretty and perky Maggie Gyllennhaal. She has looks that make one stop dead in their tracks! Equally lovely is her character, the self confident, leftist, rebellious baker, Ana Pasquel. The scene where she is moved by agent Harold Crik's very amateur, yet heartfelt guitar and singing improvisation is one of the most moving scenes I've seen in a long time. You can see and feel her heart buttons being pushed, BIG time. Although I saw it in the theatre, this one is destined for a place in my permanent collection.
0743537009|4.0|Stephen King does not write what would be considered a classic in the sence that he doesn't show some kind of deep truth about human nature.  However, what he does write is very good literature of the horror genre.  I find his works to be very engaging.  I found this particular work to be very engaging and terrifying in a psychological sense. <br /> <br />As my amazon friend, R. Kaiser, pointed out, some of the most interesting Stephen King's stories are about objects or semi-living things that would not have much power (if any) on their own, but are instead brought to life by special people having some very special power.  This is, for example, the case with \\"The Dream Catcher\\".  In that story, an alien virus, that could do almost nothing to humans under normal conditions - happened to fall on presisely the kind of an individual that gave it the power to do massive harm that it would not otherwise be able to have.  A similar thing happens in \\"The Shining\\" (although I'm not going to spoil anything by revealing what exactly is given what power). <br /> <br />I find that books on CD are very helpful because I can listen to them while driving.  I also found that the actor did various voices very well.  I therefore recommend this work to horror enthusiasts.

B000ERU9S2|4.0|Well, after all these fine reviews, I hope you will not be disappointed if I do not go over the plot and story line for redundency sakes. What I would write is this, Robert DeNiro definitely carried this movie with an able help from Jean Reno. This is a movie about treachery, betrayal and self interest. A simple mission with complex characters who have their own agenda even although they need each other for the moment, to make it happened.<br /><br />Just about everything in this movie worked superbly well. The car chase scene was exciting and well done, the plot moves along at a brisk pace even during the \\"quiet scenes\\" and characters proves to be believable and they act that way. Much of this can be credited to John Frankenheimer who directed his final movie with such skill and finese.<br /><br />If there was a weakness in this movie, its that we have all seen this type of movie before. But then, its rarely done this good. I also thought Robert DeNiro's character was just too pat and by the middle of the movie, I began to realized that he was still on the official payroll unlike the others. Certain parts of the movie was bit predictable although entertaining.<br /><br />The movie is well worth buying since despite of what I wrote about predictable, its a type of movie that will definitely be seen over and over if you have it in your collection.<br /><br />(It kind of sad that this movie was Jean Reno's last good movie until he appeared on the Da Vinci Code. Of course, some might question if that movie was \\"good\\".)<br /><br />This two disc Collector's Edition proves to be pretty good. The image is clear, color is good and sound is pretty aggressive. The extras are entertaining although like most extras, you can only watch it once. The commentary by John Frankenheimer is pretty good, he keep the narrative going and overall, this is a worthy upgrade. I write that because most people who will consider buying this edition already owned the previous edition already.
B000JLTRKE|1.0|i don't get all the good reviews..this movie was horrible..talk about cashing in on a horrible event of our time. nicholas cage is the most overated actor ever. you can tell he's overacting in every movie he does. this movie had me fast forwarding most of the time..don't waste your time..it's basically a 2 hour movie with 2 guy trapped under rocks.. if you want to watch a movie about 9 11, watch the real thing..and see in memoriam..not this crap
B000002UB3|5.0|(Review #1000?) <br />The Abbey Road medley is pop music at its best.
B0007SM922|5.0|Arguably Savoy Brown's 2 best albums packaged together in 77 fabulous minutes and 18 songs.  I always liked the more rocking sound of \\"Looking In\\" over the more intimate blues bar sound of \\"Raw Sienna\\", but both albums really kick.  The best songs for me are are \\"Stay While the Night Is Young\\" and \\"Needle and Spoon\\" on Sienna and \\"Leavin Again\\", \\"Money Can't Save Your Soul\\" and \\"Sunday Night\\" on Looking In.  But, believe me, ALL the songs are great on Looking In if you like rock with a little blues thrown in and some great guitar solos that aren't overblown like Skynyrd's \\"Freebird\\". The music is similar to Wishbone Ash and pre-Stevie Fleetwood Mac.  Both Chris Youlden on \\"Raw Sienna\\" and Lonesome Dave on \\"Lookin In\\" provide excellent soulful vocals and to me sound more similar than different. <br /> <br />Liner notes are OK but author Alan Robinson much favors Raw Sienna over Looking In - I disagree.  Also, there is a major mistake on the back page of the booklet - the credits for each album are switched.  My only other complaint is they don't list the times of the songs anywhere.   <br />   <br />I never cared much for Foghat, except their first hit, \\"I Just Wanna Make Love To You\\" but you can definitely hear pre-Foghat in Looking In. Lonesome Dave doesn't scream as much as he did with Foghat.  It's a shame everybody except Kim Simmonds left for Foghat after this, but Simmonds landed on his feet and later editions of Savoy Brown produced a few fine albums after this, like Street Corner Talking. <br /> <br />One final note: anybody hear the similarity of Sienna's \\"Stay While the Night Is Young\\" to the recent hit by Jack Johnson called, \\"Sitting, Wishing, Waiting\\"?  \\"Stay While..\\" is a little slower pace but the acoustic guitar strumming, laid-back snare drums and vocals sound very, very similar like these could be 2 songs on the same album.  Wonder if Johnson ever listened to \\"Lookin In\\" or if this is just music evolution circling back on itself. <br /> <br />Fine,fine collection.  Buy it!!  I hardly ever hear Savoy Brown played on classic rock radios, yet I remember they were BIG in the early 70's!  And that was in Nebraska!  I think this kind of music is going to come back after people tire of nu metal.
0618680004|2.0|This arrogant prattle points out what is obvious to any intelligent person - that organized religions are based on fallacious myths and that the faithful are ignorant lemmings.  But Dawkins'argument for atheism is based equally on his \\"faith\\" that this is no Ultimate Being.  Moreover, he provides no support that adopting such \\"faith\\" will alleviate mankind's inhumanity to man.  Indeed, others might argue (see, Ernest Becker's \\"The Denial of Death\\") that such loss of faith will only exacerbate violent behavior because of a loss of a method for alleviating the death anxiety. <br /> <br />At bottom, this book does nothing more than state the obvious without offering humanity with an alternate way to resolve the human condition.  A hopeless, depressing message, even if true.

006056251X|5.0|This is my favorite in the wallflower series, because the other characters in the other series are boring.  I've read this book several times coz its funny and romantic.  I like Sebastian and Evie, the most unlikely couple to be together. But they ended up complementing each other.  I dont write reviews much often but I really like this book,so read it!
B0001WTWCO|4.0|Often cited as one of the 100 best films of all time, this film will provoke varying responses.  Direction, sound, music, photography, dressing, and script have been justly praised and lavishly awarded.  The cast looks good and they speak beautifully.  Throughout its 160 minutes, I felt I was in the presence of greatness, but the film did not endear itself to me.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|I own the book and I was hoping the movie would live up to some of the philosophies therein.  Unfortunately Celestine plays like a bad \\"Lifetime\\" movie with weak characters and undeveloped plot.  Instead it seems like a 90-minute \\"new age\\" seminar speech delivered by Soap Opera actors.     <br /> <br />The theory behind the movie of \\"two worlds\\" and being able to see \\"it\\" may be well founded, but its been done better before by other films.  If you want to see better executed movies about \\"two worlds\\" get The Matrix, They Live, Invasion of The Body Snatchers.  There are people that will get what I am talking about because they have \\"opened their eyes\\" and then the ones that have not probably have no idea. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time.  The latter movies just have better setting for the premise.  Not every book doesn't deserve big screen treatment.
0060776757|5.0|The statement that U2 members are surprisingly candid and open in this book is dead-on.  This is a fabulous book from \\"the horse's mouth.\\"  U2 fans will lose sleep because it's nearly impossible to put down.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This Cd was sugested to me when i purchased Jimmy hendricks Blues and I have found it to be better than the original CD I ordered.Thankyou very much Good Job.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I've never listened to Amnesiac really up until recently. It's strange but I never could \\"get\\" the majority of tracks on this cd. Only recently and after listening to Radiohead nonstop for the past 5 years, did I start to really hear this one for the first time. <br /> <br />It is complicated music. That is the best word I can think of to describe it. Constantly interesting and different, nothing like it will ever be produced again (unless Thom Yorke and pals become literally immortal, or they are cloned in the far future). I presume that their next release will be something  completely different than Amnesiac, yet fundamentally as crazy and unpredictable as this one is. <br /> <br />I think this album deserves more than four stars, for its sheer and undeniable tendency to shatter my perception of an entire genre of music every time I hear it. Coupled with the often leisurely listening of albums such as Kid A, this cd becomes more than itself, an important piece of whatever puzzle Thom Yorke is assembling. <br /> <br />It's fine if you prefer OK Computer to this one, there are obvious reasons why I would rather listen to that. But to say that Amnesiac is \\"a watered down version of Kid A\\" is to basically say that you don't like the direction Radiohead is taking with their music. In which case you should either not waste your time with this or listen to it 80 times until you are forced to like it.
B000IFQLKU|4.0|I love this CD.  Be aware though, that the \\"F\\" word is used in Beautiful instead of \\"flying high\\" like it says on the radio.
B000H5U832|4.0|Enjoyable and entertaining.  Good for children and for parents to watch with children.  Good Music.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is a fabulous soundtrack.  Anyone who likes good music will enjoy this cd.
B0006A9FMI|2.0|I agree with most of what is being said about this edition of this movie and if I could get in toutch with dreamworks I would tell them to offer this movie with what the fans want and maby it would have better sales here the artwork was amazing but i am not deaf and i do not want to read the movie that is what the manga (graphic novel) is for
B00070DK5K|3.0|There are great titles on these discs. (In the original versions, anyway.)  This feels like generic arena rock: the band is very competent, very plodding, very dull. Tempos are slower than usual. Somehow the whole thing is predictable, lacks excitement, inspiration...feels like they were paying the rent.  Too slick, no fire, no rock and roll rage here. Skip it.
B000001DWG|5.0|I bought this album in 1992, freshman year in college.  I was blown away by the force and depth of the music.  15 years later, unlike so much other music from my teens, this album still rocks.  RIP Andrew Wood. You gave the world your gift and then you were consumed by it.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|Wow, what  a joy it was to actually get my hands on this wonderful series. <br />It is everything I thought it would be, except that after season four, English subtitles are no more. Being a hearing impaired person, I was very very disappointed to find this out. The booklet never said...interestly the Individual box sets have English sub titles...So, If you're hearing impaired or deaf, buy the box set individually....it is a good series thought...
B00005V331|5.0|If you're a fan of old school death and want to hear a huge influence on almost every extreme band than look no further. Venom may not have been the greatest musicians in the world but what they did they did extremely well. Namely pissing alot of parents off and offending every bible thumper that saw this album,notice I say saw and not heard, as I'm sure the holy rollers s?!t themselves when they saw the cover art. When me and my wife were dating her holy roller aunt use to come over to try and \\"save\\" me, so I'd slap this cassette (I'm old!) on the stereo and turn it to \\"11\\" (ha,ha) you would think she was on fire as fast as she would run out of the house....ahhh memories! anyway, if you like old school thrash, death, black, white purple or whatever color they call it nowadays you need to pick this album up and take it for a spin, give it a few listens and then move on to their second album \\"Black Metal!!\\" But probably don't look any farther than that as the magick(?) disapears after that one. Although I haven't listened to \\"metal black\\" yet. oh well, some other day. Now I have to get back to playing my cardboard cut out guitar along to number of the beast, c-ya!
0375505091|5.0|I got the book and it is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone interested in photography, celebrities, art, or Leibovitz. The only thing better than the book was the exhibition. If you live in Brooklyn, you just missed it.
B00005JM02|5.0|I Love this movie. I loved the animation it was amazing. A perfect ocean classic if you liked the little mermaid you will love this! It is a movie that never gets old. I love it and it definalty added to my movie collection if you don't have it, then you know where to get it.

B000F8O35U|5.0|It's wonderful for my daughter and fits with her fairytale collection.
B000LC3IDI|5.0|The first Saw was the beginning of the phenominon and became an instant horror classic. It was slick, clever and very scary. Saw 2 picked up right where Saw 1 left off, extremely clever, scary and again, as in the first installment, blew me away with the ending. Saw 3 IS A MUST SEE if youve seen the first 2. If you havent seen one and two, youve got to see them before getting three to toatly get into the story. Saw three is packed with non stop action, thrills and surprises. Keeping true to the previous two, the games stakes are even higher leading up to another mind blowing ending.
B0000549B0|5.0|I had never seen this movie before but it is one of my husbands favorites.  It made me laugh and think!  I hope you will enjoy it as much as we have!

B00007ELEL|5.0|I've watched it probably 15 times, at last brain-rack. Found it at a thrift store on VHS 3 months ago.   The Dude, whose heyday was in the 60's, lives in a bungalow in Venice, Los Angeles California, drinks white russians, smokes doobies, listens to Creedence and Dylan, has a crucial rug in his living room, and bowls with his friends Walter Sobchak, a fat and well-adjusted Viet Nam vet, and Donny something-or-other. That's really all you need to know.
B000024TFY|4.0|If you compare Sad Wings of Destiny to any other Priest album, or if your only familiar with their 80s stuff, you'll notice a BIG difference in the style the music is played. I want to say this album is like a heavier version of old RUSH songs, but that would be insulting because this is Judas Freakin Priest we're talking about here! The songs on Sad Wings are long, not very heavy, artistic, and more complex than their later albums. Its a tough one to call, but you have to give credit where it's due. Priest really did a nice job on this album.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|Quirky? Guess that really depends on your definition. A generic plot summary of this film says that it is about a flaky family going on a road trip to win higher self-esteem for their slightly overweight youngest member. This leaves a few things out. Like, the grandfather (to whom the family has given complete access to their little daughter, including spending the night with her alone) is a porn user -- an open porn user, I mean, he reads porn in the van on the road trip,it's a whole \\"funny\\" and \\"quirky\\" scene, and in his words, it's not just any porn, it's the worst kind of porn, the not air-brushed kind, whatever that means. It was the grandfather's job to prepare Olive for the competition. Guess what her talent is? Stripping! And guess what the wonderful break through this family makes is? One by one, they proudly mount the stage, and bump and grind along with her. Man, I am so inspired! <br /> <br />As an aside, as in the old Chevy Chase movie, the grandpa dies on the road trip -- in fact he commits suicide, another inspirational moment of the film --and we get is a series of cheerless takes on \\"oh, my, what shall we do with the body?\\" In the end, he apparently is cremated and left in the dusty California destination of their dreams, with no ceremony, no goodbye from the family, nothing. <br /> <br />If this is our new world vision of the family of the future, of an inspirational family in any form whatsoever, God help us.
B00005JPKC|5.0|The second half of Clint Eastwood's two-film look at the Battle of Iwo Jima (Following last October's \\"Flags of our Fathers,\\"), \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is an emotional, fascinating look at the battle from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers. In this film, Eastwood shows the Japanese mentality during the war, but also shows that some were uncomfortable with it. For me, it shows that, when you strip all politics and ideologies away from war, all true soldiers fight for the same reasons: for their country and those they love.<br /><br />The movie follows the actions of two key players. Oscar-nominee Ken Watanabe (\\"The Last Samurai\\") gives a great performance as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the man given the responsibility of commanding the garrison on the island of Iwo Jima. Here, we see a man who knows that fighting against the United States is a no-win situation, but will still defend the island for his country. Kazunari Ninomiya gives a fine performance as Saigo, one of the common soldiers in the Japanese army. His character is complex: one who didn't want to fight, but was conscripted to join the army, leaving his wife and child behind, and Ninomiya pulls of the part splendidly. The rest of the cast give great performances as well.<br /><br />While the film does move a bit slow at times, the great performances, fine storytelling, and exciting battle sequences more than make up for the film's slower passages. Overall, I say that \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is a better film than \\"Flags of our Fathers,\\" giving us a look at those we fought against in a kind, somber manner. I recommend this film to both historians and war-film afficinados.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B000068OCS|5.0|Has any fan of this movie ever noticed that the very impressive airplane-graveyard footage, with what seems like thousands of retired B-52 bombers, has been cut from this dvd-version? I hope it's not censorship... Very puzzling, indeed, if you ask me...
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I like the sound of these fellows. I like their beat and it's upbeat at that. \\"Nights In White Satin\\" is just so moving. There is certain romanticism in their contemporary pop operatic style that just gets you moving. The CD is just a tad short. I would have like a few more songs, yet I still liked it very much.
0618680004|4.0|Like many fine treatments of similar subject-matter, TGD preaches eloquently to 'the converts'.  As for the masses of non-converts, whom Dawkins is particularly eager to sway, TGD is no likelier than its predecessors, in this genre, to exert much of an impact on them.  The unswayed are mostly unswayable, for the simple reason -- as Dawkins is well-aware -- that they really DO believe what they believe.  And despite Dawkins' strong -- and eminently reasonable and rational -- arguments to the contrary, their beliefs can never be completely overturned by rational argument.  The believer's standard of evidence for god's/gods' existence is not simply reasonable doubt, but the merest hint of the shadow of a doubt.  If even Dawkins must fall back on a probabilistic (albeit convincing) argument for the non-existence of god, he is forced to leave the door of possibility slightly ajar.  Or so the believer will invariably argue.  The same is true for any -- yet advanced -- arguments against ultimate cause hypotheses.  Science may one day explain why matter exists at all, and whence it sprang -- pending the long-term survival of our species, I suspect science will do just that -- but for the moment, again, the door is ajar.   <br /> <br />Dawkins' critique of fundamentalism, creationism and other religious isms of similar stripe, is brilliant, timely, and spot-on.  I share his contempt for small-mindedness, the a-prioritizing of 'truth', and the a- and anti-rationality of much of what passes for religous belief these days (as in much of human history).  I also share his delight in the beauty of all things infinitely large and infinitesimely small, enormously fast and colossally slow, that abound in nature and are revealed, bit by bit, by science.  Dawkins is surely right to tout the majesty of nature, the excitement of discovery, and the virtue of rational inquiry.  And he is surely right to assert that we need have no god concept in order to do good, behave morally, and treateach other with kindness and respect. <br /> <br />What I think Dawkins fails to realize, however, is that religiosity or faith -- call it what you will -- need not be altogether incompatible with science, the scientific method, and rational thought.  Dawkins suspects that most scientists who assert a 'belief' in god, believe in the deistic manner of Einstein.  This is doubtless true in many cases.  But it need not be true.  There are more alternatives under the sun than Dawkins' two extremes: scientist as deist/(quasi-)agnostic~atheist and scientist as theist/creationist~design theorist.  Either of these extremes assumes that the 'believer' in question definitively subscribes to a specific theory of belief.  As TGD ably demonstrates, god-theories stand up exceptionally poorly under withering reasoned critiques.  Dawkins may be interested to learn, however, that it is entirely possible -- no insupportable internal contradictions need arise -- to simultaneously entertain a supralogical god-belief (for whatever reason(s) one might wish to do so, or have been 'indoctrinated' to do so) -- one that demands no internal justification on the believer's part and is thus insusceptible to logical critique -- AND a complete 'faith' in science and the use of scientific method.  In other words, with only a semblance of illogic I can (and shall) assert that it is entirely possible to be an atheist (in Dawkins' strong sense of the term) and yet to cheerfully hold a certain god concept.  I suspect, in fact, that the convictions of many of those scientists whom Dawkins questions are of just this sort. <br /> <br />Like everything Dawkins has written, TGD is a terrific read, full of fascinating insights and cogent arguments.  If it is highly polemical, at times, it is so for all the right reasons.  TGD is an important book, in troubled times.  I highly recommend it.
B000002H5I|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and have for many years. Those who are unfamiliar with Tracy Chapman should probably begin with this album. It's such a wonderful album because it's poignant, when you're in that type of mood. But it's also music you can sing and dance to, when you're in that type of mood. Very versatile. I love Tracy Chapman!
B000007T1M|5.0|Hmm, how to start.  There's a short list of mainstream hard rock/metal bands that don't suck, and System of a Down is right towards the top of that list.  All of their stuff, thus far, is worth listening to, but the self-titled debut still stands as their most striking and consistent album.  There are a few brief missteps, but it's an excellent album altogether, and it serves as proof that not every mainstream band needs to be totally dull and formulaic.<br /><br />Though SOAD haven't totally revamped their sound over the years, the debut still has a fairly distinct sound within their catalogue.  It's quite a bit more raw than their later albums, with a very explosive guitar sound and Serj still does pretty much all of the singing here all alongside some particularly frenetic drumming.  SOADs trademark, frantic, jittery songwriting is fully-formed already, however, and it's actually better than it would later be, as it just feels more natural than it would later be and they eschew the out and out joke songs that would hamper more recent albums.  At 13 tracks, however, it's got a tad too much material.  The two shortest songs, Ddevil and CUBErt probably shoulda been cut.  They're both kind of annoying, and 11 tracks is more than enough, especially since nothing else could be considered filler.<br /><br />Anyway, there are a bunch of standout tracks.  \\"Know\\" is perhaps my favorite track, with the best, most energetic chorus on the album.  \\"Sugar\\" is a notable radio track, and it shows SOAD balancing their act nicely, as it's goofy with out being self-consciously so and still rocks plenty hard.  \\"Spiders\\" is the other big radio song, and it's one of the most distinctive tracks.  A very eerie track, for sure, with some especially strong vocal work..  \\"Soil\\" is another excellent one, with probably the most frantic drumming on the album and the most impassioned sounding vox to boot.  Mind is another weird one which recalls \\"Spiders\\" slightly with it's combination of smooth, jazzy quiet parts and the eventual heaviness. \\"Peephole\\" is probably the most aggressively catchy song on the album and it has a fun pseudo-polka beat.  Finally, the album closes with another particularly strong track, \\"PLUCK\\".  This is another very typical SOAD song, mixing the wild, driving instrumental sections with the almost ethereal chorus.<br /><br />Ehh, I ain't got much to say here.  SOAD rocks, check it out.mooth, jazzy quiet parts and the eventual heaviness. \\"Peephole\\" is probably the most aggressively catchy song on the album and it has a fun pseudo-polka beat.

B00000IQC8|3.0|A decade or so ago, I was crazy about this movie. It was on my top 20 list. Then, as the years went by, I analyzed what I love about it. The bad acting? The mediocre script? The fact that I laughed about 4 times? What did I love? Silent Bob who didn't say anything throughout the movie? Anyway, I bought it for a friend recently, who works in a convenient store because I thought she'd relate to it. She didn't think it was great, but at least mildly amusing. Nowadays, I honestly think that Clerks is one of those that you're \\"supposed to love\\", but really, it's just okay.
0156030306|5.0|How would you feel if you were mentally slow and became a genius through science, but when finally able to see the world clearly, found out you would quickly turn back to the person you were before?  That's the truth Charlie has to live with in \\"Flowers for Algernon,\\" and that's the truth we have to live with too.  Reading through Charlie's progress from before the experiment, to the height of his genius, then to his quick mental deterioration is bittersweet and heart-wrenching.  But throughout his story we see Charlie change from pure innocence, to one who has lost his innocence.  We see the cruelty with which the world treats those who are different, no matter if they're smart or stupid.  Charlie finds that he can't win, and his emotional struggling with the \\"old\\" Charlie and the people in his life becomes the center of his life.  He wants to make peace with the Charlie that's still inside him and his feelings about those he loves, before he isn't able to anymore.  But it's not only the readers and Alice Kinnion who know and care how great Charlie had been.  Charlie also realizes that he is better for all that he went through, and most importantly, he is happy. <br /> <br />We as readers also have much to learn from Charlie.  He opens our eyes to the hypocrisy of society, first through his childlike innocence, then as a mature genius.  Even though \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" was published in the 60's, Charlie Gordon's experiences are still sympathizable.  The messages about humanity are just as valid today; even more so, in this age of technology.  The novel is not so much about the downside of competition in science, as it is about the failings and strengths of the human condition, which remains ever constant even as technology changes. You may just cry with sorrow as well as happiness for Charlie at the end, for who he is, and who he was, if only for a little while.  However, no matter at what mental stage he is, Charlie is still amazing.        <br /> <br />
B000JJRIP2|3.0|The only reason to buy this boxed set is for nostalgia.  The packaging is excellent, no question.  The booklet included contains a number of tasty photos plus complete (if miniaturized) reproductions of the booklets from Alive and Alive 2.  The alleged remastering of sound on the three first live sets may or may not have improved the sound.  It's that hard to tell.   <br /> <br />The real selling point here, to be hoenst, is the Millenium Concert that was to be Alive 4 before contractual agreements fell through and the album was shelved for nearly seven years.  As with the first three live sets, much of the show was reproduced in the studio.  Kiss is not the only band to use this practice, so I have no problem with it.  Eddie Kramer, who produced the classic Alive, confessed that little beyond Peter Criss' drums was actually live.  The rest was all studio work.  My only question was, seeing as how this was more of a studio project, why wasn't more emphasis placed on the clarity of sound?  The guitars on the Millenium Concert lack the distinguishable qualities found on Alive.   <br /> <br />The musicianship of the band - with the notable exception of Ace Frehley - is spot on.  Gene Simmons has always been a competent bass player and Paul Stanley's vocals just keep getting better with age.  Peter Criss - who was fired most recently for apparently not having chops - is incredible on the fourth disc.  Even if the tempo drags a bit at times, you can blame the whole band and not just the drummer. Ace Frehley, who hasn't developed at all, as a guitarist since 1978, is just an unneccesary element.  The same solos, the same notes, a clearly rerecorded vocal on \\"Into the Void\\" and not mush else to offer.   <br /> <br />Yeah, I bought it.  I'm a Kiss fan and I wanted a copy of the concert.  But did I need another live version of those songs?  Probably not.  I bought it for nostalgia.
B00003CX8N|5.0|So often films fail to live up to the magic of the books they are based on, but not in this case.  If you have read the book of the same title, you will love the movie.  Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins truly become their characters.  They are as you have imagined them.  You will laugh and cry as the book lover and the book seller correspond and their relationship blossoms.  Lovely!
B00005JPDS|5.0|Every time Will Smith ran in this film, I'd hear a part of me cheer him. I doubt he can act any better. Let's save ourselves sometime and give him at least an Oscar Nomination for this film called Pursuit of Happyness. Now, you may wonder what is about this film that's worth liking. Mere words (or my words) can't explain but I'll try.<br /><br />Chris Gardener(Will Smith) is a man who's wife has left him. He has no income and lives on selling some machine. He has one son who's five years old. He runs around to find a job vacancy or to sell his machine. Sometimes he runs from the taxi driver while at other time he runs behinds hippies and crazy folks. There is much more but I'll let that be.<br /><br />Queer intrigue attaches itself it's self to Will Smith in this film. Everything about him makes you want to cheer him on. I relate to Will Smith. His fears, troubles, tears, smiles, gestures and shoes become yours by the end of the first hour.<br /><br />Don't miss this film. I'm not gonna call it life affirming. All I can say about this movie is Will Smith, Will Smith and Will Smith.<br /><br />Respect is no longer earned. It is snatched.
0143036742|5.0|This book IS obliquely about the history of tractors, but it is also about the secrets, the weaknesses and the strengths of a Ukrainian family who settle in Britain, told at times in a concise, first person 'Ukrainian/Russian' style (eg no prepositions). Two sisters come together over their 84 year old father's doomed marriage to a scheming 36 year old Ukrainian with obvious assets. The story is poignant in that it deals with lost opportunities and gross injustices which makes it feel one of the most 'real' or 'come alive' books I have read for a while. I felt sad turning the last page as the characters, although drawn simply are nailed accurately and recognisably.  The warmth behind the book lifts the spirits, especially on a cold, wet day (which is all this book takes to read).
B000K7VHPU|3.0|Edward Norton gives a great performance. If you like him, you will like this film. The storyline  keeps getting lesser interesting as the movie goes on. The reason I give this film three stars is because I felt robbed of my time in the end. I mean, the end just didn't really do justice to the premise and a few things were left unexplained. The dialogues are decent. The sets and locations are fine. Some scenes in the first half were overwhelming while the sub-par end was the only major flaw I found in The Illusionist. The love story within the film was a tad dodgy cause there was no chemistry between the two involved. Paul Giamatti has done better films. His character had just one expression.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say, NOT BAD<br /><br />However, I will recommend this film to everyone. It's quite ambitious.
B00000055E|5.0|This is Tupac's third best album. #1 All eyez on me, #2 Until the End of Time. Put this cd in the player and listen to it from start to finish. If you dont get goosepimples, check your pulse! This cd got me through many hard times growin up, its that real.
B000002HD5|5.0|There's a cinematic quality to the way this album comes roaring out of the speakers at you. You can really visualize the lyrical turns and emotional soul-baring. The music has an incredible arrangement that carries the lyrical highs and lows dead on, and makes for a combination of lyrics and music that few can compare to. I'd say this is close to the epic power of Faith No More in the 1990's. Highly recommended.
074356619X|5.0|This idea of Universal Laws is not a new concept to me, in fact, in reading it, listening to it, it has brought back great memories, rekindling in me the love I have for creating my reality.  It works, my life up until the past 12 years was created by my  thoughts.  The past 12 years I got caught up in drama and forgot about the secret.  Watching the video reminded me once more that I had created the past 12 years and it was not what I wanted...began to turn my thoughts around, and my life is turning around.  I recently asked the Universe to have my friend Judith call me, because the numbers I had no longer were right, and within a week she called me.  I thought, Yep, Im back!
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is like experiencing creation at the moment of bang.  There is a pure synergy of creative power here that flows right through your soul.  This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane praising God Almighty through the medium of a new kind of music which far exceeds the depth and breadth of mere words. Yes it's experimental, but I find an unfettered truth here that transcends anything produced today. This style has been copied by so many for almost fifty years, but clearly this album stands beautiful in it's orignal setting like a priceless jewel.  Listen and hear the wheel go round.  Buy it, own it, experience it. It's pure art and history.
0446691437|4.0|Very simple book that had a powerful impact on me personally.  If you are self employed it can be an especially strong reminder of what it takes to succeed. <br /> <br />Set the excuses aside and read it, worth your time and money.
0385486804|2.0|I picked up this book because my husband was reading it.  It had an interesting story, but I couldn't help thinking the only reason it was being written was because the kid died.  There is nothing particularly great about the story.  I was very irritated on all the side stories (including the author, talking about himself) within the book, which didn't add anything except pages in an already thin book.  Outdoorsy people may like this book, but unless you like reading about how people get themselves killed by being overconfident, skip this one.
0618680004|5.0|An excellent and thoughtful discussion on a subject that many are too afraid to openly discuss or think about.
0743454537|5.0|I read this because someone in my book club recommended it.  It was wonderful and controversial; I couldn't put it down.  A surprise ending will leave you guessing and probably in tears (as I was).  I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good fiction novel.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|When I saw \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" at the cinema, I enjoyed it, but I was not wowed so much by it. Much to my interest, \\"The Director's Cut\\" came my way. Curiously, some \\"Director's Cuts\\" are just a few sunsets added, along with 5 or 10 minutes of some guy riding a horse across admittedly spectacular scenery. Happily, this is not one of them.<br /><br />The added material in fact gives a lot more to the plot, and I agree with Ridley Scott that some of it should never have been removed. The subplot about Sybilla's son added more to the political intrigues, which I felt made the movie much better, giving it more substance. In short, the Director's Cut was much more interesting to me than the original release.<br /><br />The characterisations and the depth they receive with the added material also make a richer and more rewarding movie. In some parts, Orlando Bloom seems a little contrived, but overall the acting is first class, to match the first class cast.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD package in all respects. Honestly, I would be surprised if anyone finds it inferior to the shorter versions of the film. It is very thorough in all respects, including the supporting materials on the other 2 discs. This is an excellent movie version and the package is well worth getting.
0691126887|5.0|The book is really complete, with very nice draws of the species listed, and some interesting information about each group and species.
055358202X|5.0|Words can't really express how much I have enjoyed this series!  And I am downright impatient waiting for the next book to be released!   <br /> <br />Before i got my hands on the book, I saw a lot of reviews and comments complaining that characters were left out of the book and i was actually a bit doubtful.  Fear not!  Mr. Martin has done an excellent job and kept us busy enough groaning over the intrigues and games the characters are playing to make us forget that some of our favorite people are MIA.  I think this book has pushed this series to the top of my favorite books list!!!  The story is so complex and there are so many surprises.  You love the characters and hate them at the same time.   <br /> <br />Be warned!  You will laugh, you may cry, and you may throw your book across the room, but you definitely will not sleep!  The book is difficult to put down =) <br /> <br />
B000GIWS7E|4.0|Dream Theater. 20 years and they're still going very strong. Score really shows that they haven't burnt out and are ready to keep on rolling. This DVD features a simply amazing concert. The orchestra is a nice touch, and their use in Six Degrees is really good.    The problem I have is the same I have with Metallica's S&M, they orchestra is underutilized. It only compliments, but doesn't really make a difference in the music.    Still, this DVD is a must have for Dream Theater fans. The bonus features, while not as numerous as Live at Budokan's, are great. And Portnoy's tux shirt is awesome too.
B00006CXSS|5.0|band of brothers is by far the best mini series ever to be created.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|I saw Wicked when it toured through here and it was a really spectacular show.  I was really looking forward to enjoying the CD, but was very disappointed.  Sure, the performances are great (although I think I prefer Julia Murney's 'Elphaba' to Idina Menzel's), but the engineers who recorded the disc should be shot! <br /> <br />Rather than doing a proper mixing job, the discs's producers decided to give it the 'Top 40 Radio treatment' and smashed every ounce of dynamic range out of it.  The vocals are right in your face, as are the drums, obliterating pretty much everything else and forcing it flat into the background.  Those who aren't familiar with studio recording techniques might not notice it, but the trained listener will be extremely put off by the steamroller-style compression job... not only does it make the disc feel sonically lifeless, but it actually becomes fatiguing to listen to after a while.  The human ear just isn't made to take constant, uniform sound pressure levels like this.  There's simply no breathing room left at all. <br /> <br />My low rating here is for the 'Wicked' cast recording itself, not the show or the score (those get a 5 from me).  Unless you don't care much about the sound quality, or only plan to listen to the disc on a really crappy car stereo, you may find this CD bordering on unlistenable.  You'd think a show raking in as much cash as this one could afford a decent mastering engineer.
0307236722|3.0|I absolutely adore the pizza crust recipe, and now make pizzas almost weekly.  I have adjusted it slightly to double the olive oil and a tsp of cider vinegar but great.  Everytime I make the olive oil bread though, it browns up at 20 minutes instead of the recommended 35 minutes, and yet again the dough was raw in the middle.  Now I will have to correct the book for 425 instead of 450 degrees. Also way too much salt for this recipe and the course salt hurt my husband's teeth. <br /> <br />I found the carrot cake recipe flawed, the cake part is absolutely delicious, but the icing is down right gross.  After shredding 2 cups of carrots by hand I was very upset to throw it out, but had to...  The icing is 3 packages of cream cheese with 2 cups of butter and like a cup of powdered sugar.  Well, it tasted just like cream cheese, raw, with a hint of ginger and vanilla.  Nobody would eat more than one bite!!! But asked my grandma and she said one pkg of cream cheese with whole package of powdered sugar, and one stick of butter.  So, I made another correction. <br /> <br />The sugar cookie recipe is really good, and other breads I have had good success.  Another pet peeve of the book is PREP TIME??  The recipes are so involved you have to read and reread to figure out how much time to allocate for the recipe... <br /> <br />I hope the rest of them turn out, and it's been fun trying different things to make them work so I can't totally complain... And the pizza dough is fabulous, so I keep trying new things.
B000J10EQU|1.0|I rented this movie and boy did it suck bad acting superman only really used his powers the last 20 min. and the rest of the movie was flash backs to the first superman made in 1975. if i could give it no stars i would.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have the deluxe DVD-A version since the day it was released. And, unless you have a DVD-Audio player, like a few reviewers state, there is no difference. So, yes, you would be wasting your money on the \\"deluxe\\" version. Aaahhhh... but if you are able to listen in 5.1 channel (actually 4.1 channel, there is no center channel) on a high quality sound system with real speakers you'll be amazed. The other conclusion I've come to, is the CD needs to be listened to completely through, beginning to end. Something of a lost art in these days of I-Pods and CD players. Remember the days of the long play album and sitting and listening to an album side all the way through. The album is best absorbed with a complete listen. And, it is amazing. The alternative is to listen through a pair of high-quality headphones. Real headphones. Not $15 I-Pod ear buds.  <br /> <br />One other point I'd lke to make. Listening to this reminds us of how technically proficient the Beatles were. How gifted they actually were. To think that some of these recordings are almost forty years old. And, if you listen closely, you realize how much Ringo actually did bring to the songs. He was an excellent drummer and made his parts fit in perfectly.  <br /> <br />If you are expecting hit singles and individual tunes to download to your I-Pod, this is not the CD for you. If you want a complete musical experience of an hour and twenty minutes, you won't be disappointed. Especially if you have the equipment to experience it the way it was intended. And, if you are old enough to remember the release of a new Beatles album stacked up on the counter of your local record shop, you may be in for some goosebumps moments. <br /> <br />And, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make....
B00004Y6NX|4.0|Dire Straits is a great band, but this is one of their best albums.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|I'm not even going to consider recent films like Hostel, the Hills Have Eyes and Saw films \\"horror\\". It's more like a demented version of a slasher film. These films in essence rely on buckets of gore to scare their audience but therein lies the rub: it doesn't scare. Instead what it does is create a feeling of disgust, a \\"eww!\\" or a cringe rather than chill you to the bone and make you lose sleep. While I'll admit Saw was a pretty good film for what it was, on subsequent viewings it did fall apart and Saw II was just awful. Saw 3 is more in spirit to 1 but it's also filled with flaws from both. <br /> <br />A bit more ambitious in scope, we follow 2 threads: Lynn, a doctor, is taken in by Amanda and Jigsaw because Jigsaw's tumor is getting worse and he wants to be alive to see the end of his next game. In another thread, Jeff, haunted by the death of his son, is not being tortured but what's tested is his need for revenge: he meets people that are strapped into torture devices and he has to get them out. Of course, in the world of Saw, it's not that simple. <br /> <br />Be forewarned: this is definately the goriest film the series has seen. Does it work? Kind of. The victims are dispatched in unbelievably gruesome ways but rather than let your imagination take over, we see everything so nothing is left to wonder about. While it does make you cringe, especially one scene involving surgery, it doesn't really scare you to the point where you get goosebumps but rather you're hoping your dinner doesn't come up. Luckily the film has enough of other things to take your mind off it rather than just mindlessly putting in gore for the sake of it(I'm looking at you Hostel). <br /> <br />How's the story and everything else? It's actually better. While there is plotholes and inconsistencies and whatnot, it's also a bit more better written and being able to juggle various stories, including scenes that involve the first 2 flims are fun so this is much better than part 2. Will weget a more super-duper version later on? I don't see how. We have all the gore we need, 3 commentaries and featurettes so what else needs to be shown? Although to capitalize on the inevitable Saw IV, we'll probably get another. <br /> <br />I don't know if you'll want to buy it unless you love this stuff but give it a rent then make your decision then. Me? I liked it, far from loved but I wouldn't want to own it.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|What a powerful and moving film. At first the movie does not make sense and some scenes especially in the japanese night club go on too long but when it does come together you can not help by being moved by how lives in different parts of the world can intersect. I can't wait for it's release on DVD.

032147404X|5.0|Like the title says, \\" The single best photography book i've ever bought.\\" A few months ago i've started up my own photography company. Only knowing a handful of stuff from college i knew i still needed to learn more. I've must have bought atleast 8 books over the course of 2 months. Then Amazon recommended this book. This book is in lack of a better term. \\" Idiot proof\\" It tells you want equipment you need, how much it cost, where u can buy it. The reading is easy as if the author is just talking to you face to face. Its kinda sad how i've learned more about photography in this book then years in college.  <br />But all things aside. IF your new to the photography world and your looking for something straight forward and tells you exactly what you need. But this book. Its thin compared to other books in the subject but packed with USEFUL info. But if you think i'm full of it. Try it out and prove me wrong. Scott Kelby, u rock man.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|This \\"album\\" reminds me a lot of \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" which also was greatly influenced by Gilmour. I was a little unsure about buying a solo Gilmour album. Not that he isn't talented, but I was looking for the \\"band\\". My fears were unjustified. The album is certainly mellow, so don't expect to be knocked out by supercharged guitar solos. <br /> <br />Just play and enjoy.
0743298020|5.0|I picked this book up on the advice of a good reading friend.  It started out a tad slowly for my taste and I put it down several times, but by the time I had read about five chapters, I was totally engrossed in the twisting, turning, compelling subterfuge of Vida Winters' storytelling and the tale of her life as a twin with a crazy mother & *uncle*.  The twins aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, either, but I don't want to give away too much. . . I hate it when a review gives away the plot!!<br /><br />The plot was excellent and well-paced.  The ending tied up all loose ends and left me with the contented feeling of having read a fine Victorian mystery novel.  I highly recommend this book if you haven't read a \\"different\\" sort of mystery in a while.  It's a fabulous tale, well told.  What more could any reader want?
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When it comes to follow-ups to a Bond movie, one must understand the needed presence of some certain unalienable elements. One always makes use of the capacity to build upon the achievements of the previous film. With Casino Royale, a film that sets itself apart from the others due to the very nature of it being the first mission for James Bond, a Bond who is still green in the field and happens from time to time to be a bit sloppy, the creators managed to not only keep the preset elements, but give them some substance as to what they mean as well. <br /> <br />Since the inception of the Bond film and its release back in 1962, the movie always began with a pair of tracing white dots following each other from left to right across a black screen. Once they reached the edge, the view through a gun barrel would pan in from the right following a well-dressed man walking in a plain white room. At the middle of the screen, the man in view turns and shoots straight ahead. Down pours a puddle of red blood, and the gun barrel wavers left and right. <br /> <br />The gun barrel scene is iconic. It sets apart the entire canon of Bond films from the botched rehash attempts made. It was the brain child of an incredibly talented visual designer named Maurice Binder, and has been lovingly adopted and modified over the last 44 years. <br /> <br />James Bond creator Ian Fleming made the impulsive mistake early on in his career to sell the rights to his first novel Casino Royale whereas he held onto the other novels until the arrival of Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. The result was both an agitation and a hidden blessing. <br /> <br />For years it was presumed that the movie Dr. No was Bond's first mission. It premiered in 1962 and portrayed a hardened Connery with a roguish panache and a smarmy self confidence that the world over has known to accept as the epitomic portrayal of James Bond. All fans of the novels know that Bond was not always perfectly in control though, and that flaw in temperament is evident in Casino Royale. <br /> <br />A few years ago when Sony Pictures bought out MGM Studios, suddenly all the cards fell into place as it were. The long pined-for rights to Casino Royale had finally come back into focus along with the companies that owned the rest of James Bond, and so began a tiresome heated production of one of the greatest gambles in James Bond history. <br /> <br />For starters, Sony Pictures is a giant in Hollywood that very much wants to make as much money as possible from anything it does. Therefore it felt that by milking the Bond machine for everything it had, they wanted to go nuts-to-the-door spectacular. Bond had become famous for its use of incredible gadgets, statuesque women and a fairly untarnished hero. Eon Productions, the company now in the hands of Broccoli's daughter Barbara and step-son Michael G. Wilson, wanted to take the less popular approach and show the hero in his early days . . . without the toys and the posh exterior. <br /> <br />As for how the proceedings between Sony and Eon transpired, I don't know truly other than that Eon got what they wanted in the long haul. And by doing so, one of the most fan-shaking decisions came about. They needed a new Bond. Pierce Brosnan carried the mantle for seven years. He had played James Bond - 007 in four very-well received movies. He was by every means still popular in the eyes of the fans of the films, but mostly in the eyes of the young fans who only knew the franchise led by him. Letting Brosnan go was a decision that brought about wide-spread panic and endless speculation about \\"The New Bond.\\" <br /> <br />Then the name game began. Ewan MacGregor? Hugh Jackman? Clive Owen? Adrian Paul? Christian Bale? Web sites popped up like mushrooms after a hard rain. In particular was the rash of sites dedicated to the return of Pierce Brosnan. Many a fan, in my opinion, never took into account the notion that in Brosnan's last picture Die Another Day he wasin his fifties and clearly showing signs of age in his face and in his hair. I'm just as much a fan of keeping along a talented actor, but the face needs to match the requirements of an ageless hero who moves with time itself. <br /> <br />Production on the next Bond movie was quickly becoming the largest gap between films since the wait between Licence to Kill and GoldenEye. Two and a half years passed before Eon Productions came forward and finally announced that Casino Royale would indeed be the film to be made. It was then six months following that the company made it public to the world who the next man would be. And his name was Craig . . . Daniel Craig.  <br /> <br />Daniel Craig is an actor who bears little familiarity in the States. His greatest claims to fame were crime dramas in Britain. Only such pictures as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Layer Cake presented him to a small portion of film audiences in the USA, so his great reveal was understandably less than warmly received. But I prefer to remember history rather than let it fall to the wayside. Some 40 years ago when Cary Grant was an option to play Bond, the producers favored rather an unknown actor by the name of Sean Connery. It was a choice that even Bond creator Ian Fleming had serious doubts about. Just look how wrong everyone was. <br /> <br />And now, 44 years later, just look how wrong everyone was again. Having the man who directed GoldenEye at the helm, Casino Royale was the first Bond film in history to both redefine and reinforce the strengths of the franchise. The world will realize that Daniel Craig is James Bond, no matter how rugged, untamed, temperamental, inexperienced and brash he comes off. <br /> <br />And so we come back to the beginning. How does one reinforce the norms of such an old franchise while at the same time keeping it new? It goes into Fleming's description of what it takes for Bond to become 007. He needs two kills to his name. And so instead of starting the movie withthe usual (and expected) gun barrel sequence, we instead get to see a black and white noir-ish scene interlaced with grainy black and white footage of a brutal conflict in a lavatory. We understand that these are to be Bond's first two kills. In a clever work of editing, we get to see the second kill before the first. Why? Because the first one ends with the view through a gun barrel of Bond standing against a white wall, he turns to face his opponent and fires one shot straight ahead. Crimson blood pours down the screen, and then we are treated to the opening titles. <br /> <br />Elation comes in so many forms, but none so much as being gratified so much by something that has kept you bated for four years. The gun barrel is a mere sequence that hardly lasts more than 15 seconds at the most. Casino Royale's decision to make the audience work for it is one of the best decisions that I could ever hope for. <br /> <br />The title sequence by Daniel Kleinman features psychedelic representations of silhouetted spies running amok amid lethal playing card and casino motifs. All is loosely matched to a subtle rock theme by Chris Cornell entitled \\"You Know My Name.\\" It's a song that has the capacity to grow on someone after each listening. The titles also sustain and depart from the established norm. They contain silhouettes, which have become unanimous with the style of Maurice Binder. However a lack of any representation of the female form is seen, which lends it to more reminiscent of the opening title for Dr. No while also looking somewhat like the titles for Licence to Kill. <br /> <br />The silhouettes are of Bond and several nameless assailants in various forms of combat while at the same time being pitted at the mercy of lethal playing card accents. We are also treated to a teaser image of the Bond girl when a gun sight crosses over a queen's face revealing Eva Green who plays Vesper Llynd. At first she is revealed from the queen of hearts, but the other end of her motif is that of the queen of spades, a clever method of foreshadowing a nuance to her character. The titles conclude with a slowly on-walking silhouette that transforms into Daniel Craig giving a cold stare, very much a serious and fierce take on his ageless character. <br /> <br />The movie opens up onto a military camp in Uganda where we are first treated to the introduction of the film's villain Le Chiffre. He's a tall gaunt man bearing a familiar look to that of Peter Lorre (who played Le Chiffre in the 1954 inception of Casino Royale presented by the show Climax!) and a little bit of an evil Macaulay Culkin mixed in. This Le Chiffre has a few more tweaks though, a positive step toward making him look a bit more sinister. He has a scar over his left eye, he has a tear duct that cries blood and he habitually uses an inhaler. This man is the mathematically inclined banker and investor for several terrorist factions around the world. <br /> <br />In the same locale, we find Bond on his first mission as a double-0. He's commanded by MI6 to capture a suspicious, and horribly burn-scarred, suspect named Mollaka. Things go awry when Bond's aide blows their cover causing the incredibly agile target to tear off into a construction site with Bond in hot pursuit. The target is chased up scaffolding, over a couple of cranes and back down again through a Nambutan embassy where 007 finally get his man. Upon seeking his escape, Bond uses his prisoner as a wrecking ball until he ends up in a courtyard surrounded by armed guards. With everything to lose, Bond takes the risk of swiping his prisoner's backpack, shooting him dead and blowing up a series of gas tanks allowing for his escape; all of which is caught on surveillance camera. <br /> <br />It's a great achievement on the part of the film makers to let us believe completely that James Bond could die at any second despite us already knowing that he carries on to fulfill other missions. It's expert writing and directing, because I was constantly on edge wondering if this will be the one that finally ends the life of 007. But it's also more than that. There are instances of other movies with spies in them that look to copy what James Bond has done, coming never so close as to the grandeur and originality of what Fleming and Eon came up with.  <br /> <br />The resulting mayhem causes 007 to make headlines as a murdering spy, turning MI6 into the laughing stock of London. M, played once again by Judi Dench, throws a considerable fit when she learns about Bond's failure and code violations. She becomes even more surprised to find that he's broken into her home to find him casually browsing through a suspect database on her laptop.  <br /> <br />Film consistency continues with this remarkably hilarious scene. It shows that an untamed Bond is even more prone to insubordination that he would be as a tenured member of the secret service. The only reason he ever gets away with anything he does is because he's so good at his job, which his superiors constantly find themselves conflicted over. Bond's free thinking and unconventionality rob the straight-laced affiliates of prestige and success. Anyone else who violates a direct order or international code would face serious consequences. The apex of Bond's punishment though is nothing more than a terse reprimand. <br /> <br />Following the suggestion of M, Bond looks to keep himself out of the public eye (if only for a brief moment). He travels to Nassau based on a lead found from the material he swiped from the bomb maker he assassinated. His nonchalant meandering allows him the opportunity to fake his identity as a valet driver, and create a tremendous ruckus in the parking lot sending the entire security staff of a high-end hotel to investigate, thus leaving the surveillance office vacant and open for Bond's perusing leisure. <br /> <br />What makes me the most jealous of James Bond is his immaculate skill and grace in wandering about in placeshe doesn't belong. Not only does he do it with such stealth, but he's cocky about it too. Every environment becomes his playground the instant he steps into it. <br /> <br />While placing occupancy for a room in the hotel, he cleverly manufactures a charismatic lie to gain knowledge of the subject he witnessed in the surveillance office. His charm of course is placed on that of a lovely blonde woman, the easiest target for 007 to interrogate without making his efforts seem like an interrogation. After he finds out what he needs, he manages to successfully track the man, Dimitrious, down, beat him on a whim at a game of Texas Hold'em, win his gorgeous Aston Martin and seduce his smoldering Latin wife Solange. <br /> <br />In a surprising turn of events though, Solange is abandoned with only a bottle of Bollinger to keep her company as Bond whisks away to a Miami airport in an attempt to find what her husband is up to. They meet up in a crowded terminal where they share wicked stares and a fierce yet silent knife fight. Bond comes out the winner, and the loser of the battle waits out the rest of his time on screen unnoticed. <br /> <br />In the scuffle though, Bond loses track of the materials that he saw the man place in the terminal for the next contact to take up and carry out the terror plot. But with skillful use of ingenuity, 007 uses his last victim's phone to call up the next target in a crowd. Bond finds his guy and continues pursuit. The situation escalates when the man being followed puts himself behind a locked door. Bond calls up MI6 seeking assistance only to be met with smarmy bureaucracy. His quickly detailed explanation soon puts them into motive panic however just in time for Bond to realize he didn't need their help at all. <br /> <br />As is common with 007 films of the past, ridiculously exciting action set pieces materialize in unlikely places. This one shows no weakness or fatigue. Bond and an the intimidating terrorist play fisticuffs in the front seat of a fuel truck rocketing across the tarmac toward a prototype jetliner that our main villain Le Chiffre is counting on going up in flames so that he can make a killing on the stock market. Unbeknownst to him though, our man Bond comes through in a clench, putting him at a serious financial disadvantage. <br /> <br />Thus the first act concludes with M not so much apologizing to Bond for having a higher sense of what he was up to than anyone thought, but rather a commendation for strength of character. After all, if M were to ever thank 007, it would only be spoken in sarcasm. <br /> <br />Le Chiffre organizes a high stakes poker game at the title location in Montenegro to win back everything that he lost on the non-disaster. With great reluctance, James Bond is staked in the game by M, only because he's the best card player in the service. <br /> <br />For grand entrances of the famed Bond girls of old, this film seems to shift that stock to the lesser of the two. Solange was introduced riding a valiant steed across the beach. In the case of Bond's biggest crush though, treasury executive Vesper Llynd just sort of shows up and drops into a seat in front of James and announces, \\"I'm the money.\\" <br /> <br />Bond retorts, \\"Every penny of it.\\" (That's the only hint of Moneypenny in this movie; maybe in Bond 22 we'll see the real deal.) <br /> <br />What is surprising about this film (apart from other new things) is that Vesper's character is much more rounded out and multidimensional than the usual heroine. This is a woman that laughs, cries, sulks, seethes, screams and seduces. She has the same amount of dynamic that Diana Rigg did when she played the woman to be James' wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. <br /> <br />Perhaps in the process of getting caught up on the reverie of finally seeing my favorite film hero on the screen again I neglected to mention that the scenery and cinematography of this movie surpass even the greatest of installments in the anthology. The vistas are absolutely breathtaking. It qualifies as being one of the films in which the places that James goes are places I would desperately like to visit some day. <br /> <br />Casino Royale then steam rolls into the segment of the film which I refer to as the Fleming section. It's the content that was ultimately pried from the pages of Ian Fleming's first Bond novel. With the timely adjustments to fit the modern age, it plays out like an impressive cat and mouse game of high stakes gambling. <br /> <br />A sudden shift in the momentum is a dangerous calculation, but I'm slightly biased in this endeavor. I like Bond more for the subtleties in his character and the fancy quirks he uses to really upend others. One charming example is his disruption of the game to have a waiter bring what becomes his infamous Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred. <br /> <br />The director is wise though to not simply hash out a half-hour long poker game on the screen. Select cuts and recesses are installed to keep tempo moving. We have instances where Bond is actually forced to look after the villain and make sure he doesn't get ousted before the end of the game. A number of terrorists show up unannounced and voice their concern over Le Chiffre's ability to return their money that he lost. <br /> <br />Bond exercises his savage brutality as Vesper looks on in complete disbelief. A chilling shower scene later on builds credit to her character's inexperience in the film. We also get to see Bond for the first time in a great while in a truly perilous situation having much to do with his famous beverage. For a movie to make you believe that James Bond could die on his first mission is phenomenal storytelling. <br /> <br />The climactic scene at the poker table is heavily rewarding after all the drama that ensued with Bond going for broke, losing everything then being graciously reentered through the help of a long time (first time met) friend Felix Leiter. Aficionados of the game with balk at his highly improbable finish, but to them I give the middle finger and a smug, \\"Good day to you.\\" It's a Bond movie. Stuff like that is supposed to happen. <br /> <br />To celebrate his grand victory, Bond and Vesper have dinner alone in Casino Royale's dining room. The elation is short lived with she steps away briefly only to be kidnapped. In pursuit of his lovely, Bond manages to accomplish one of the most heartbreaking of exploits . . . he murders his Aston Martin. To make matters worse, he gets kidnapped afterwards too. <br /> <br />What follows next is the scene that I feared to see because of the contextual nature of it. Like never before seen, Bond is brutally tortured. But like I had never seen before in my life, it became one of the most visceral and yet hilarious things I had ever witnessed. To merely explain it would do such great injustice. <br /> <br />Beyond the climactic turnout of that scene, we come to the slow-roving finale in which the story twists when you don't expect it to. Bond falls in love with Vesper but soon finds himself once again caught off guard. And like no Bond before, it actually sets itself up for a sequel. <br /> <br />Now what was that name again? Ian Fleming took the name James Bond from a book called Birds of the West Indies. It just so happened to be the name of the author. He chose the name because it had no great importance or attitude about it. It was just a name. Yet from mediocrity came something internationally famous. <br /> <br />It all began in a casino in London in the movie Dr. No. A non-descript man sits at a table playing baccarat. His face goes unseen. Across from him is a dark haired woman in a red dress. As the hand proceeds, he ends up beating her. She has an understandable look of irritation on her face. The man says to her as she's writing out her check for more money to stay in the game, \\"I admire your courage, Miss . . .\\" <br /> <br />\\"Trench,\\" she replies. She looks up at him and adds, \\"Sylvia Trench.\\" She then says to him, \\"I admire your luck, Mr. . .\\" <br /> <br />We then finally get to see his face as he slowly lights a cigarette in his mouth and replies, \\"Bond,\\" and then mockingly adds, \\"James Bond.\\" <br /> <br />In its inception, Bond, James Bond was meant only as a joke. When Guy Hamilton directed Goldfinger, the film that is commonly referred to as the one that set the Bond formula, the introduction was used again. The film to follow was Thunderball, the highest adjusted grossing Bond movie of all time. It was both an expansion on the Bond formula as well as a fist against all the critics who never liked Goldfinger, and the fist takes its form in the guise of a femme fatale who ridicules Bond for his playboy nature. She is the one to call him by the name \\"Mr. Bond, James Bond.\\" And so from then on, in every film following the character of Bond always introduced himself that way at least once. <br /> <br />So what has become a tradition is surprisingly the greatest pay off in Casino Royale. With all the remarkable set pieces, action sequences, dramatic diversions and dreamy locales we get the famous introduction as the very last piece of dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br />Following through the end credits the words \\"James Bond Will Return\\" roll up from the bottom. A great sense of apprehension and relief consumes me. It means that I will get to see a great actor return to play Bond again . . . in two year's time. <br /> <br />I know exactly what I'll be doing on November 7th, 2008.
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is my favorite version ever!  Hands down, not contest!  I have seen the 1st have of the masterpiece theater version and like it.  But this version is definately better in my opinion.  If you've never watched it, please do!  You'll enjoy it!
B00005JPGM|5.0|Disclaimer first: if you are cheching this review for summary of script, you've come to the wrong place. I deal in impressions, not story-revealing.<br /><br />I saw it at opening evening, and it was a premiere sponsored by UNICEF. So the movie began with a long advertisement for UNICEF and UNHCR. Which is ridiculous, cuz if you have ever been to any of the conflict zones you KNOW that:<br /><br />1) UN staff mainly just take care of their safety and collection of danger pay<br /><br />2) UN staff (mission personnel and military involved in \\"peace keeping missions\\") are known for all sorts of misbehavior, from smuggling to raping children.<br /><br />Now that we have put that aside, let's go to the movie:<br /><br />First think that stroke me was the realism of the movie. Thanks to the multifaceted story, brilliant acting and excellent camera/ editing.<br /><br />The movie sucks you right in. I was jumping in the seat moaning \\"run run!!\\", I cried several times in the movie, I was shocked to see what happens in this \\"civilized\\" world we live in, I was embarassed to be complaining about \\"a bad day at work\\" or \\"dissatisfaction with life in general\\" I sometimes feel, I was happy to be born NOT in Africa (thou some might think Croatia is not THAT much better), I made a decision NEVER to buy another diamond, I was appaled at world business and all value being lost and forgotten apart from $$$.<br /><br />And that was one of the aims of this film, to make us reflect and adjust our behavior, and do our little thing to make world a better place.<br /><br />To this point, Connely says to DiCaprio \\"good things are done every day. just not by you\\". In the end, they both do good things. So can all of us.<br /><br />Kudos to casting director in this film. Thou I don't really like DiCaprio, he IS an excellent actor and he proves it from one movie to the next. In this one, his \\"Rhodesian\\" accent, the whole role of white boy in Africa /traumatized mercenary was compelling.<br /><br />Connelly in one of her better performances.<br /><br />Last but not least, Hounsou and Vosloo (oh he ages so good!).<br /><br />Cannot praise this film enough.<br /><br />Sorry about the long anti-UN rambling. Croatia has had its experience with them, so I kindda know what I am talking about..<br />Last but not least, Hounsou and Vosloo (oh he ages so good!). <br />Cannot praise this film enough. <br />Sorry about the long anti-UN rambling.

B000G759LW|5.0|I don't buy albums often because they are frequently a let down...not this one. Some of these songs are so forceful and catchy, you instantly are enamored. Others grow on you. Her voice has never sounded better (it almost sounds as if she's holding back at times! Her voice is so powerful!) Great dance music, great ballads. Christina is going to be around for a long time...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The writing for the show was incredible. Giving the story lines somewhat of a \\"western\\" flavor for being out in the \\"frontier\\" of space was a unique plot twist.Too bad it did not catch on. Only 14 episodes leaves one hanging, but the movie did bring some closure.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is a mesmerizing drama.  No wait, it's a mysterious comedy.  No, it's a psychological romance.  I'm not sure how to label Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, except that it is a great, great film.<br /><br />The viewer is entrapped in the construction, or rather the deconstruction, of love.  Joel(Carrey) has a surgical procedure done to erase the memory of his ex-girlfriend, Clementine(Winslet).  He does this after learning she also had the mind erasure performed.<br /><br />It is a vivid journey through Joel's memories, and during the operation he realizes how much he still loves her.  But he's already paid to forget her.<br /><br />Can true love find a way to survive?  You'll have to watch and see.
B00008EY7H|4.0|Cirque du Soleil is always a joy to watch, but I do have a few problems of the DVD of Alegria. A couple of the acts kind of drag on a bit, particularly the fire twirler and the trapeze artists. The ringleader character annoyed the you know what out of me. I do like the music in this show a lot, and would like to get the soundtrack.<br /><br />Some of the camera angles were wierd, and would cut away from the act and zero in on the audience or sideline performers at the worst times!<br /><br />Amazing acts include the hula hoops, the strong man and the contortionist! I also like the sad clown.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|I LOVE this album, I have read other people saying that this is not the real MCR, well people change, their music change, this is the REAL MCR everything they have done has been the real MCR. You can tell in this album how much has changed and how much is the same. It is probably my favorite of their albums. The band playing + Gerard's voice + the lyrics makes this album great, (great is even an understatement their are no words to describe this). Some awesome tracks to highlight are DEAD!, House of Wolves, MAMA!, Teenagers, and  Famous Last Words.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins new book titled The God Delusion is an intellectual and fantastic read. All theists should read it.  It is a demonstration of reason and intellectual integrity.  So many religious individuals contend that all life and the universe is so complex that it could not in any way have self originated / organized or eternally existed.  They then turn around and contend that because of this improbability or impossibility, that it must have been manufactured or created by a prior mysterious intelligence called a god, and that this complex intelligence either self originated or existed eternally.  Does anyone see the hypocrisy in this reasoning?  Dawkins does, and this is what he means when he talks about statistical improbability.  You cannot go and make the argument that life or the universe is so complex that it could not have self originated / organized or eternally existed, then brazenly turn around and allow a mysterious complex entity called a god to do what you just finished saying could not be done.    It's nothing but hypocrisy and bad reasoning period.    If complexity within life or the universe cannot self originate or self organize, and prior intelligence is needed for it to do so, then surely this also includes a hypothetical complex thing called a god, because he/she/it would be the highest example of ultimate complexity self originating or self organizing.  If this highly complex thing called a god can do it, what's preventing life or the universe from doing the same thing?   The answer is obvious, nothing.  The question that remains is why are religious individuals giving this god thingy special privileges, and disallowing them for life and the universe?  We know the answer of course.  The belief in a god gives the individual a promise of immortality and eternal happiness after death. So they allow it into their belief system.   It would seem that when making such claims the theist does indeed believe complexity could self originate or exist eternally.  It's just that there has to be a payoff in it for them.   This in my opinion is intellectual corruption.     Even if we are open to the possibility of something's existence somewhere within our universe or even in some other hypothetical universe closed off from our own, it does not give anyone the right to go beyond that, and contend it does in fact exist.   Once anyone makes the jump from a possible to positive existence of something without a shred of testable data to give it credence, they automatically become intellectually irresponsible.   What's worse, is that they are also encouraging the same type of dishonest and dangerous reasoning done by other humans that practice terrorism in the name of an untestable, unprovable entity that they claim is communicating to them.   If all theists are allowed to do it, then so are they.   And they do. They practice the same dangerous and dishonest method of self manufacturing truth and knowledge that in turn gives them the ability to kill mass amounts of people in their entity's name.   They have faith that they're invisible friend is factual and real, and is commanding them to do what they do.   Testable data and proof is both irrevelant and unnecessary.   No matter how horrible, lethal and sick a terrorist's actions may be, most theists can only condemn the actions, but they cannot condemn the method of how terrorists attain their message of destruction because it's the same method they utilize to get their religious truth and knowledge, by mere personal interpretation of scripture.   Once truth and knowledge is allowed to be self made this way, nothing on the face of the planet can refute it, or convince those that attain it that it's wrong.   All the terrorist has to do is condend that other theists interpretations are wrong, and when that happens it gets us nowhere.   Truth and knowledge can now be made by anyone, anywhere, by mere personal interpretation of scripture, and nothing natural can refute it.Welcome to the ultimate nightmare for planet Earth.     Atheism is having no belief in a thing called a god that currently has zero testable or provable evidence for its existence.   If and when proper evidence can be given and tested, a positive belief can then be warranted.   This is called intellectual honesty, and that is the safest, honest, and proper way all beliefs of extraordnary claims should be based.     Dawkins also discusses evolution in his book.  The fact that so many Americans disbelieve in the process of evolution is sad.  How does a small piece of natural knowledge make so many people upset or recoil in emotional disgust?  Evolution is a fact, it is taught in schools and universities right across the planet, and it well be done so for thousands of years into the future.  There is absolutely nothing anyone can do to change this fact. All one can do is personally deny it until the day they die, and when that happens evolution will still be taught as fact by our species.    Any individual can go outside right now and look at the world.  They can see for themselves that much of life on this planet sustains its existence by having to hunt down, kill, and eat other life forms.  One life eats another to survive.  Even vegetarians in the strict scientific sense must kill life to live.  How then can a theist proclaim that all life was created by an all powerful and loving entity who then sets forth a divine plan to have his creation (life as a whole) cannibalize itself to sustain itself?    It makes no rational or moral sense. Some people don't seem to think about what their religion is actually saying.    Even humans are preyed upon by various flesh eating bacteria, viruses, parasites, mosquitoes, ect.   Here we are, supposedly a god's greatest creation, and yet we're reduced to mere live food for other life.     Even if the theist appeals to the old claim that our world is an imperfect one due to some disobedient individual called Adam, it still does theargument no good.  A hypothetical god would still have to determine what the default conditions would be for such disobedience, and would be ultimately responsible for having his own creations, humans and other animals alike, compete in a blood sport to sustain their survival while he/she/it watched.   Again, this makes no sense. It's a childish belief.           Natural evolution in a universe that is indifferent to the physical and emotional needs of all life is the only rational, sensible and proven explanation. It states that if true, we should find life caught in a brutal competition and struggle for survival.  This is what it predicts, and that is exactly what we find.   No one can deny this fact.  Saying it's the beautiful plan by some all loving, omniscient, omnipotent intelligence is complete nonsense.    It is time for our species to come out of their emotional crib and walk on our own without the need of sky parents having to hold our hand, or mythological stories to help take away the fear of death. It's time to come to terms with our mortality, and with the knowledge of who and what we are.  Our progress in this endeavor may indeed be slow, but sometimes that is how progress is accomplished, one small step at a time.  Humanity is slowly growing up.      The God Delusion is a great book by an intellectual author.   I for one am in complete agreement with it.
B000I5X81K|4.0|What's with you folks? So many reviews and not one mentioning \\"Un dia llegara\\"?! It's by far the most touching song I heard for years. Passion, yearning - it's really uplifting and touching. And I think the serenade-like content gets through even if you don't understand every word of the appropriate lyrics in Spanish. <br />And it is sung by a superb voice.  <br />This is the first Josh Groban cd I know, but definitely not the last one. And I should look up the composer's list of works too...
B00005OWIU|4.0|I thnk that the soundtrack is okay. I wish some that some of the music wasn't so cheerful. Harry Potter story is not really a cheerful one. That \\"Prologue\\" piece is going to be as famos as the \\"star wars\\" theme and \\"superman\\" theme. For my I would have put a little bit of mystery in the song. I wish they would have made music called \\"Harry theme\\". I also wish John Williams would have not stoped after the 2nd one. I would have love to here his \\"Volemorts theme\\"
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is ECs best work since his collaboration with BB King. However, if you think this will be hard blues offering, then look to the pairing with BB or somewhere else. ECs guitar solos don't exactly rip but they groove well with the music. Way better than his recent efforts. The guest guitarists are very good, especially the solos by Derek Trucks - his sound oozes and moans. I typically don't like overproduced records and disagree with the reviewer who thought this too slick. I never found Cale's albums to have the raw edge the reviewer was hoping for and think it unrealistic to be found here. I have been a JJ Cale fan to some degree owning a couple of his albums and find the talented musicians on this record really enhance his tunes. I rate this album 5 stars not because it is one of ECs top few efforts but in comparison to the new music that has been available in the past ew years.
B000005HLV|5.0|Let's be honest here. If you are a big BM fan, then this album MUST be in your collection. There is no ifs, ands or buts about it. Considered by many to be the absolute pinnacle of Black Metal, Mayhem's long in the making first full length is a barrage of barbaric, brutal and extremely cold Black Metal. We all know the stories about this band so I won't discuss that here. That is not important when reviewing the music. This album was supposed to come out as far back as 1991 but due to Dead's suicide that never happened. You can hear some of these songs played as long ago as 1988 on the rehearsals they did at the time. Truly groundbreaking at the time, had this come out in 1991 or so this could have possibly changed the face of what we then knew as BM.  <br /> <br />You see, during that time BM was still a thrashy music style. Bathory did it perfectly, but these guys took it to the next level. Using speed picked power chords and dischorded melodies, the songs all revolve mostly around 3 or 4 central riffs, but develop into a grand symphony of death and carnage. Euronymous was no slouch when it came to writing cold riffs and his riffs present here are very raw and hateful. Hellhammer's drumming is immense and full of chaotic blast beats and thunderous double kick. Varg Vikernes of Burzum does the bass on here and he provides some catchy parts as well, especially during Life Eternal and Pagan Fears. Vocals are handled by Hungarian madman Attila Csihar, formerly of Tormentor fame (and now the current vocalist of Mayhem again.) His vocals aren't the typical BM rasp, but are very eerie and cold and his clean chants on the title track are truly disturbing. Some people don't like his vocals at all, but I find them to fit the cold nature of the music perfectly.  <br /> <br />This album is dedicated to Euronymous and it is a fitting tribute to the legendary founder/guitarist/scene leader. I'm sure he would have been very proud of this album and even more so proud of what Mayhem has acheived in his abscene. Overall this is a classic within the Black Metal genre and it should be in every BM fans collection no questions asked.  <br /> <br />\\"All my time is dedicated to the WAR and everything involved, including band and label.\\" - Euronymous, 1993
6305922756|5.0|\\"It's kind of a pastel black.\\" <br /> <br />And so opens the DVD of \\"This is Spinal Tap.\\" If you haven't seen \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" by now, do yourself a favor and SEE IT! The ultimate mockumentary, \\"This is Spinal Tap,\\" takes us on tour with Spinal Tap as they promote their latest album \\"Smell the Glove\\" and every heavy metal band stereotype makes an appearance. The result is genius and not to be missed. <br /> <br />Of course the DVD comes along with the standard hilarious extra footage, an interview with director Rob Reiner, trailers, music videos, and more. But, the part that's worth it all, and the part that will keep you rolling with laughter throughout, is the Audio Commentary by Spinal Tap. <br /> <br />When I first selected the Audio Commentary, I expected to hear  Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer (the actors who make up the band Spinal Tap) talking about what they had to do for each scene. Instead, I found myself doubled over with laughter as all three actors give their commentary IN CHARACTER! If the movie was funny, the movie with commentary from the actors in character is hysterical! You hear the guys reflecting on people they meet in the movie, making excuses for mistakes they made, and more and it all serves to make the movie that much more funny and worth watching/owning. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of \\"This is Spinal Tap,\\" the Audio Commentary is not to be missed. You will truly be missing a second movie of the original. Personally, I've now watched the Audio Commentary version more times than the regular version!
B00005JNS0|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles?  \\"Cars,\\" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings.  It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen.  The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices.  It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the \\"eyes\\" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).<br /><br />Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse.  While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town.  The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations.  It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn`t winning the big race).<br /><br />The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival.  There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town`s medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo.  There's also an assortment of ethnic types with thick accents to flesh out the scene and indicate what a melting pot even an America made up entirely of motor vehicles would be.  A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman.  You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie.  Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, \\"Cars\\" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features.  Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile.  Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and \\"drive\\" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip.  Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves.  For a movie built entirely on driving, \\"Cars\\" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time.  The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to \\"drag\\" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does.  There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter.  In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as \\"The Great Race,\\"  \\"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\\" or \\"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\\" as its source of inspiration.  Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.<br /><br />The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film.  These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer.  But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, \\"Cars\\" is too often stuck in neutral.ilt entirely on driving, \\"Cars\\" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time.

B000J103YI|5.0|She deserves every accolade and award that she is currently getting.  She has a long and interesting career ahead of her if she affiliates herself with the right people and gets good management.      In my opinion, she sings AITYING better than Jennifer Holliday because she sings it with the feeling and emotion that comes with being dumped by your boyfriend and finding yourself pregnant at the same time.  There is more to delivering a song than belting out notes and Jennifer manages to deliver unlike Beyonce.  Beyonce sings \\"Listen\\" well but again with no feeling and no emotion,  I was bored listening to her.
B00005JPAJ|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />In the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel, the human race, filled with the sins of arrogance and pride, builds an immense structure that will allow it to reach the heavens, and, in so doing, achieve equality with God.  Enraged by such presumption, a jealous Jehovah punishes the people by scattering them to the four corners of the earth and confusing their language.  It is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's contention, in his latest film, \\"Babel,\\" that we are still paying the price for that event all these thousands of years later.  For the point of this film is that, even in this technologically advanced age of instant, global communications, we are basically all still separated from one another by the barriers of race, religion, culture and, most especially, language.  Indeed, it is this last factor that seems to cause the most problems, for it results in serious miscommunication and misunderstandings, which in turn lead to immense personal suffering and human tragedy on both an individual and global scale.<br /><br />As he did in his previous films, \\"Amores Perros\\" and \\"21 Grams,\\" Inarritu, working with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, has fashioned a multi-narrative work that pays little heed to the spatial and temporal rules of conventional storytelling, going back and forth in time and space, as it spins a tale set in three widely separated and distinctly different corners of the world.  The movie begins with the delivery of a rifle to a poor Islamic goat herder who is barely eking out an existence on a barren, windswept hillside in Morocco.  When one of the man's young sons uses the gun to shoot into a nearby bus filled with American tourists, the boy sets into motion a series of events that threatens to have immense personal and political repercussions for the individuals and nations involved.  The bullet strikes a woman (Cate Blanchett) who is touring the country with her husband (Brad Pitt).  Seriously wounded, she is taken to a nearby village where Pitt works frantically to get medical attention for her while an international crisis threatens to erupt over the incident.<br /><br />The second story involves the couple's young children back home in California, who are taken on an unauthorized trip to Mexico by their illegal-immigrant nanny desperate to attend her son's wedding.  The third tale, set in Tokyo, seems, at first, entirely unrelated to the others until the tenuous connection tying them altogether is finally established near the end of the film.  This one involves a deaf teenaged girl, embittered by both her handicap and the recent suicide of her mother, who begins to act out in ways that reveal her intense loneliness and willingness to do just about anything to fit in.<br /><br />The makers of \\"Babel\\" really challenge their audience by not going for obvious connections and by allowing the film to feel formless and disconnected for fairly long stretches of time.  I admit that I kept flashing in and out of the film for about the first two-thirds of its running time - at times feeling it was a work of genius, at others, feeling like it was not working at all - but, eventually, the movie won me over entirely as the meanings came more into focus and as each story moved inexorably towards its emotionally wrenching conclusion.  Much of the credit in this regard goes to the powerful musical score by Gustavo Santaollala, which starts off slowly then builds in intensity as the movie draws to a close.<br /><br />In each of these three stories, problems arise as a result of either an inability to communicate clearly or a stubborn refusal to say what needs to be said at a given crucial moment.  But the real power of the film lies not in its message but in the intensity of the individual moments it shows us, be it Blanchett's pain as she undergoes treatment for her wound; Pitt's desperation in getting his wife to a place of comfort and safety and his emotional breakdown while speaking on the phone to his young son; a wild ride through the desert Southwest as a young man madly attempts to outrun some border patrol officers in hot pursuit; a young girl's humiliating attempt to seduce a compassionate but clear-thinking older man; a poor father's moment of despair as he comes to realize how his son's actions have brought shame on the family.  The film is replete with many such moments.<br /><br />Inarritu has drawn riveting performances out of his large cast, primarily from Pitt, Blanchett, Adriana Barraza and Rinko Kikuchi.  Even though they aren't given the quantity of screen time they would have received in a conventional single-story film, these performers all make the most of the scenes they are in.<br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss \\"Babel\\" for being contrived, pretentious and self-important, for pretending to be more insightful and profound about the state of the world than, perhaps, it really is.  As such it would be an easy target.  Yet, \\"Babel,\\" for all its seeming \\"significance,\\" is surprisingly restrained in driving its message home, unlike, say \\"Crash\\" which literally screams out its meaning with every contrived incident and line of dialogue.  \\"Babel\\" requires its viewers to think - indeed it ASKS them to think - in ways \\"Crash\\" never comes even close to doing.  Like many challenging artists, Inarritu and Arriaga may be too full of themselves for some people's tastes, but at least they don't talk down to their audience.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" captures the paradox inherent in a world in which we are brought together by circumstances and our commonality as a species, yet driven apart by our differences.sert Southwest as a young man madly attempts to outrun some border patrol officers in hot pursuit; a young girl's humiliating attempt to seduce a compassionate but clear-thinking older man; a poor father's moment of despair as he comes to realize how his son's actions have brought shame on the family.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|I picked this album up a couple of years ago, what guy couldn't enjoy the song \\"cold hard B#$%^\\".  This album did spawn 4 fairly sucessful songs, Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Rollover D.J. , Look What You've Done, and Cold hard B#$%^.  I enjoyed it for a while, but got tired because of radio overplay of Cold hard b#$%^ and Look what you've done.  THey have come out of with their second album, Shine On, which continues very much with the same sound. Again, great album from a couple of years ago, but its staying power as a classic is weak, and has faded with time.  Good, not expensive, and a couple of good track. Consider for the collection as a marker in time.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Better than Submerged, but that's not saying much.  My wife and I have seen almost all of Stevies movies and, next to The Foreigner and Submerged, this movie ranks up there in the Horrid category. <br />What is up with the voice dubbed over when Stevie was mumbling.  We kept trying to guess whose voice that was (Burgess Meredith, The guy who played the other terminator on T2, etc.).  That was the only thing that kept us from turning it off 30 minutes into the film. <br />I can't see why Blockbuster dedicated two rows for this tripe; maybe there are more of us die-hard SS fans than I realized.  Even so, SAVE YOUR MONEY ----DO NOT BUY/RENT/STEAL/VIEW
0375703764|5.0|In reading a lot of these reviews, I notice that many people feel they were cheated out of a horror novel. And in a sense, they were. I believe that House of Leaves is not supposed to be horrific, and it's badly categorized as a horror novel. What it IS supposed to be, I'm not sure, but I can't resist this story for its non-linearity and general sense of chaos and distraction.
B00070DK14|5.0|Better than A, better than War Child and Too Old To Rock, and a host of other Tull albums, this one is the synthy follow-up to A, and largely forgotten in the U.S. completely. It's a beautiful album full of layered, odd, sad and overall TULLISH songs. One of my favorites. It's different from Songs From the Wood and Heavy Horses in the same way that those albums are different than Aqualung, but it's pretty much just as good as everything else Ian Anderson wrote from 71 - 82.<br /><br />Don't be closeminded, this doesn't sound like you're uncle's Locomotive Breath, and if you hate the 80's and you can't stand keyboards, well I suppose that's your loss. This is a great great record, almost no filler.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I had the old Criterion edition of Seven Samurai, and while it was great to have the now reconstituted entire 207 minute version of this glorious film, it was a bit disappointing that in many places the transfer was made with badly damaged stock, but I assumed Criterion, as usual, got the best master material available, so it was a minor distraction to having this masterpiece restored to its original length.    When I saw that they were coming out with a new edition with a superior transfer I bought it.  Well, it is terrific.  The picture quality is vastly improved and the sound track as well.  It is very clean, with just a few very minor flaws, hardly noticeable.  There are some additional scholarly commentaries, worthwhile for context, as well as some new documentary materials and interviews on this 3 disc set, beautifully packaged, with a booklet of interesting essays.    Many other reviewers have done a fine job of explaining why this film is a must-see for movie-lovers, and why it is not only one of the most important and popular Japanese films, but why it takes a place at the top of any list of world-class masterpieces, beloved everywhere.  If you have never seen it, by all means rent or buy this copy and immerse yourself in Kurosawa's world filled with humanity and humor, duty and honor, joy and sorrow.  For me, and I see by other reviewers, it is one of the easiest and most pleasant 3-1/2 hours one can spend entranced by movie magic.    Kurosawa was a tremendous technician and a ground-breaking director and all his films have been influential to film-makers the world over, and none more so than The Seven Samurai.  He was also a man of great passion and subtlety, and this film has so much more to offer than simple action, although that action is some of the finest ever staged and put on film.  A masterpiece acknowledged by film-makers and audiences alike, this exhilarating film is so well worth your while.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|A wonderful DVD set! The three versions (yes, three!) each have their own merits. The colorized version is reasonably vivid without being harsh on the eyes. The B&W version is a near-perfect restoration. The TV version is a nice bit of retro-media history. The interviews with Miss O'Hara are fascinating....boy, talk about someone who has aged so gracefully. The rest of the special features are a great insight into Hollywood history and studio marketing just before the beginning of the TV era. Well worth the tiny price.
1569242739|5.0|I looooooooooveeeee these and so do all my nonvegan friends!  I have always loved to bake, but since I kinda suck.. adapting a recipe to be vegan always ended in disaster...but this book takes all the guessing and difficulty out of that.  I appreciate that they explain most of the ingredients in the beginning.  I have probably made more dishes from this book than I have from any of my other dozen cookbooks combined.  I've never gone through sugar and flour so quickly.  I would suggest this book to any one, a beginner baker, an expert, and any one vegan or not.  All of these taste great..  if these last more than just a couple days with my omnivore husband around it's a shocker!
B000003CM8|5.0|The Allman Brothers are one of those bands that I have \\"discovered\\" rather late in life.  Years ago I worked in radio for a year and we were able to bring albums home from the station to borrow overnight if we wanted to listen to something.  I remember borrowing \\"Eat A Peach\\" and \\"Enlightened Rouge\\" and thought they were both good, but it did not make we want to run out and buy a bunch of Allmans stuff.  Over the past 10 years I have discovered a growing appreciation of blues based music and thus went back to re look at the Allmans.  The result was basically falling in love with their material and I have since picked up much of their stuff.  The first Allman Brothers album has to rank up there with the best debut albums of all time.  The album contains classic after classic, \\"Not My Cross To Bear\\", \\"Don't Want You No More\\", \\"Trouble No More\\", \\"Dreams\\" and the band's most well known classic \\"Whipping Post\\"  The album is solid all the way through and formed the blueprint of all that came after.
B0009IW98O|4.0|Years before Bob Seger really popped on the current music scene, Smokin' O.P.'s was released. Not alot of original tunes, but Seger put his own signature on several great rock era songs and made them really cook. <br /> <br />If you love Bob Seger, you owe it to yourself to hear what he did before his star really rose.
B0000029AL|5.0|The first album from the bad boys from Boston.  Overall it is a pretty good debut.  Lots of grungy blues rock that the band would perfect in years to come.  The album contains the classics \\"Mama Kin\\", \\"Walkin The Dog\\", and a song I have never gotten sick of \\"Dream On\\" which IMO is the great rock power ballad of all time.  The rest of the album is fairly pedestrian in its approach with songs like \\"Make It\\", \\"One Way Street\\", and \\"Moving Out\\" showing some of the early fire that would carry these guys for another 4 decades.  They still usually perform at least a song or two from this album in concert today.
0385505833|1.0|I couldn't get into this book. I liked Bleachers, A Painted House, Runaway Jury, King of Torts, and the Pelican Brief by Grisham but I just didn't care for this one. It's not like his other books at all. It tells of a story of a family who wants to skip Christmas but why? CHRISTMAS is the time to spend with family not poke fun or make light of it. This book wasn't what it was cracked up to be and the story was dumb. Didn't care for it at all.
B0000029AP|4.0|This used to be my favorite Aerosmith album, but listening to it right after \\"Get Your Wings\\" and \\"Rocks\\" it does not hold up quite as well.  I think the slide was beginning oh so slightly at this point as the quality of the writing was just a bit lower than their previous two.  Still, \\"Toys\\" has a lot of great stuff on it.  \\"Toys In The Attic\\", \\"Uncle Salty\\", \\"Adams Apple\\", \\"Walk This Way\\", \\"Sweet Emotion\\", and another decent ballad, \\"You See Me Crying\\".  The rest of the album is ok.  When I was a kid I thought \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" was a great song, but it is just a novelty for me now.  Toys would really be the last of Aerosmith's great classic albums.  The drugs and alcohol were really working on the band by this point and things started to splinter shortly after.
B000GY729M|5.0|today the killers are one of the most well known bands in rock music, but 2 and a half years ago very few people knew who they were. i am proud to say i was one of those. i discovered the killers in the summer of 2004. the first song i heard was \\"all these things that i've done\\" which i thought was amazing. i bought the album and instantly fell in love with it. everything was outstanding and addicting (with the exception of \\"everything will be alright\\"), and when i found the b-sides (under the gun and indie rock n' roll) i immediatly ate those up to. it was a long wait for the album and i bought it with heavy anticipation. the first single \\"when you were young\\" promised another flawless album. when it started playing i realized that this wasnt the same sound. i turned it off before i could reach then end, disgusted. the only song that caught my ear was \\"for reasons unknown\\" but i thought the rest of the album was throwaway, the definition of a sophomore slump. eventually i made myself listen to it, this time discovering \\"read my mind\\" and soon \\"why do i keep counting\\" and \\"sam's town\\". the more i listened the more i liked it. the point is that this album cannot be judged on one or two listens. it's a different sound but that isnt a bad thing. the album may or may not be as good as \\"hot fuss\\" but it is probably more consistant. its refreshing to see a band that isnt afraid to change. the only song i still dislike is \\"uncle johnny\\" and i find everything else to be positively great. and the fact that rolling stone gave this album 2 stars is sickening and further destroys their credibility.  <br /> <br />it may not be as good as brandon flowers hyped it to be (the best album of the past 20 years?) but it is certainly one of the best of 2006. and if the bandwagon jumpers dont like it then they can just jump off because the killers were way cooler when nobody knew they existed. <br />
B00005QENZ|4.0|Another decent one from the boys.  The album opens with a rap from Steven Tyler followed by several samples from this and previous albums then kicks straight into \\"Eat The Rich\\".  It is a great opening sequence and sets the tone for the rest of the album.  After that though things get a bit more average.  The rest of the album is pretty much by numbers Aerosmith which is not necessarily a bad thing, but there is not a lot to distinguish this album from many of their other works.  There are several huge hits represented here including \\"Fever\\", and three big ballads \\"Crying\\", \\"Amazing\\", and \\"Crazy\\" none of which rank up with their best ballads IMO.  Overall this is a pretty typical Aerosmith album, but for the most part I like it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This DVD is absolutely marvelous!!! A must for young and old not to mention those who like a distraction for the kids while you get on with daily chores!!!
B000003CMD|5.0|The first album with no material from Duane, Dickey Betts plays it solo for the majority of this album on guitar.  The band also brings in Chuck Level on keyboards to help fill in the gaps.  To me this has always sounded like a bit of a transitional album with Dickey Betts seeming to take more of a lead role in the band and Greg Allman more in the background from a songwriting perspective.  This is somewhat due to the success of one of the Allman's biggest singles, on this album \\"Ramblin Man\\" which is still a classic rock staple today.  Betts began leading the band down a more country blues style which starts to show up on this album.  Overall I find this one to be a step down from their previous efforts.  This album produced more radio staples including \\"Wasted Words\\", \\"Southbound\\" and the 7 plus minute instrumental opus \\"Jessica\\".  The Allman Brothers are one of the few bands that I can think of that have had a 7 minute long instrumental track actually make it into top 40 radio.  Chuck Level stands out on piano on a \\"Jessica\\" and \\"Jelly Jelly\\", and for the most part the band is in fine form, but this one just does not strike me as being quite as good as their previous efforts.
0887308589|5.0|I received what I ordered, on time, to the correct ship address and in good condition.
B000003CMC|5.0|After the death of Duane, the band reconvened and came up with this, another very strong album.  When it was originally released on vinyl it was a two record set, but it is condensed on to one for the CD release.  The album consists of new studio material and live material recorded prior to Duane Allman's death.  More Allman classics appear on this one, \\"Ain't Wastin Time No More\\", \\"Melissa\\" (which now my be better known from a cell phone commercial), \\"One Way Out\\".  The band gets close to proggy on the all instrumental \\"Les Breres In A Minor\\".  The centerpiece of the album is the 30 plus minute \\"Mountain Jam\\" a live recording that once again focus on the rambling twin guitar jams of Betts and Allman.  Every \\"jam band\\" that is around today owes a debt to The Allman Brothers who did it all first back in the day.  The album closes with \\"Blue Sky\\" a breezy little Dickey Betts number and \\"Little Martha\\" an acoustic duet with Betts and Allman.   Killer stuff.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Tobin Bell returns as the diabolical \\"Jigsaw\\" in this excellent 3rd installment of the now-famous \\"Saw\\" series.  This movie picks up right where part II left off.  We see Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) slamming the door on a well and truly trapped Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg).  \\"Game's over\\", she mutters as she leaves.  But is the game over for Matthews?  It is for one other part II carryover; Kerry (Dina Meyer).  She is investigating the death of a former ex-con who has died in a most brutal manner.  At first, she doesn't expect Jigsaw was involved, but she soon learns otherwise as the video retrieved from the crime scene shows.<br /><br />Soon, Kerry is abducted by Amanda and she meets the same gruesome demise as the crime scene victims she used to investigate.  But the real story follows .<br /><br />There are two story lines in this movie.  One deals with Jigsaw's worsening brain tumor.  Realizing his condition is deterorating, he instructs Amanda to abduct Lynn (Bakar Soomekh), a successful surgeon, to help with his condition.  Upset with her life situation, Lynn is apparently just going through the motions at her job.  Amanda abducts her and leads her to Jigsaw, where she is fitted with an explosive collar designed to detonate if Jigsaw \\"flatlines\\".  She is forced to keep Jigsaw alive or risk her own death.<br /><br />The other plot deals with a man named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen).  Jeff's young son was killed by a drunk driver, and he has been dealing with feelings of revenge.  Captured by Jigsaw and placed in a box, he is released and able to confront those responsible for the death of his son; the lone eyewitness, the leniant judge, and the driver himself.  He has the choice of saving each of these people or letting them die.  Will Jeff choose life or death?  Will he be able to overcome his feelings of rage and save these people, or will they die like so many other of Jigsaw's victims?<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the final 15 minutes.  In this time, all of the questions and twists of the movie are neatly wrapped up.  Watch closely so you don't miss anything.<br /><br />I found this movie to be the best of the \\"Saw\\" movies by far.  Tobin Bell does a magnificent job as the maniachal Jigsaw, and the other actors are very good as well.  What sets this movie apart from the first two is its excellent plot.  It will keep you guessing throughout until everything is revealed at the end.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The \\"Saw\\" series has become one of the biggest horror movie series in recent memory, and this thrilling and bloody installment maintains the earlier tradition.  The scenes in this movie are much more graphic than in the first two movies, so watch with caution.  This series has become one of my favorites, and \\"Saw III\\" keeps the action and blood flowing.
B000003CM9|5.0|The Allman's second album and another strong one.  More classic songs including \\"Revival\\", and \\"Midnight Rider\\".  The album also contains one of the most popular all instrumental tracks of all time \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth  Reed\\" where Duane Allman and Dickey Betts tear it up on dual lead guitar.  The album also features a cover of \\"Hochie Coochie Man\\" which is ok, but I have heard better versions.  This album is on a par with the first one if not slightly better.  This would be the last album for Duane Allman who died of a motorcycle accident after this album was recorded.
0060578793|5.0|this book has it all, im really happy with it and i couldnt ask for more, its a bible for survival
B000002H92|5.0|The Doors In Concert is a 2 CD collection of material that was previously released separately on the vinyl albums \\"In Concert\\", \\"Absolutely Live\\", \\"Alive She Cried\\", and \\"Live At The Hollywood Bowl\\".  The performances were all recorded between 1968 and 1970 a period when the band was going through many ups and downs with it's charismatic front man Jim Morrison.  Considering these recordings are close to 40 years old they sound remarkably crisp and clear.  The inclusion of some of Morrison's in between song rants and a two minute plus spoken \\"warning\\" (you'd have to hear it) by the house announcer to start the album, may turn some people off.  For me it helps to set the performances into the context of the time that they were done.  The mood of the crowd appears to be moody and close to being out of control which is exactly what Morrison wanted.  Musical highlights on the album include the 15 minute plus \\"Celebration Of The Lizard\\".  This work was never released in its entirety in studio form and shines here as all of what made The Doors great becomes a part of the whole.  Some people love Morrison's poetry and some think he was a hack, but either way you have to give the man and the band credit for pulling something like this off in a live setting.  Some of The Doors more ambitious (progressive?) material are highlighted here including extended versions of \\"When The Music's Over\\" and \\"The End\\".  Both rank right up with some of the best music of the 60's and the band deliver both of them with a moody ambience that in many way outdistances their studio counterparts.  The hits are here too including \\"Break On Through\\", \\"Love Me Two Times\\", \\"Unknown Soldier\\" \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and an almost 10 minute version of \\"Light My Fire\\" that features instrumental workouts from both Ray Manzerik and Robbie Krieger.  Several covers are also included; \\"Backdoor Man\\", \\"Gloria\\", \\"Close To You\\", and \\"Little Red Rooster\\" with guest John Sebastian on harmonica are all great.  Album cuts are also represented including \\"\\"Love Hides\\", \\"Five To One\\", \\"Build Me A Woman\\", \\"Soul Kitchen\\", \\"You Make Me Real\\", \\"Texas Radio And The Big Beat\\", and \\"Moonlight Drive feat. Horse Latitudes\\".  All in all I think this live disc is about as good as you could expect from The Doors and it is easy to see, on the nights they were on, how The Doors were considered one of the best acts of their day.
0321344758|5.0|This book is truly fantastic. I read it once and then immediately once again. It is incredibly informative; very interesting; truly insightful. It not only presents the bigger picture of the wonderful world of websites, but also presents examples, delves into details, and is written in a great, quirky tone.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Another good one from the boys from Boston.  The album kick starts right off the bat with the heavy rocking of \\"Youg Lust\\" \\"F.I.N.E\\" and \\"Going Down\\".  The album continues up the high energy from there.  Several huge hits came from this album including \\"Love In An Elevator\\", \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\", \\"The Other Side\\".  None of them are particular favorites of mine preferring most of the album tracks better.  They also throw in a few short instrumentals as in between song threads including \\"Dulcimer Stomp\\" and \\"Hoodoo\\".  The album closes with one of my all time favorite Aerosmith songs \\"What It Takes\\".  The song is a classic break up ballad, and happened to come out at a time when a relationship that I was in was falling apart.  At the time it was really emotional for me and I literally could have written the words to this song.  It was like Tyler had gotten into my head and pulled the lyrics straight from my brain.  The girl is long gone, but the song still brings back a lot of memories when I hear it.  It has remained a favorite of mine even today.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I like this movie- I would probably watch it again. I won't give a boring, long review, that is so overstated so here it goes. <br /> <br />Adult content and language.  It makes you sad,laugh, leaves you shocked, and you can follow the movie. <br /> <br />It is not the normal family movie, where every one gets along and only one problem throws a normal family out of whack. Like similar family vacation movies. This one is way different. <br />  <br />This is a normal dysfunctional family life.  Well, let's not hope so.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would watch it again. Good movie. Good actors. Very independant film channel looking, but the actors look familar.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|Liza gave an outstanding performance and her vocals were amazing. This was a concert of a lifetime Live from Radio City Music Hall.<br /><br />The undeniable and magic conection Liza had with the audience was another sign of her great talent as a performer and singer. I am a huge fan of hers and her mother Judy Garland and I think Liza is one of the best performers in the music industry after her mother.<br /><br />I have never seen a performer that fits right in with her audience like Liza did in this live concert. Her interaction with the people was just wonderful. She was born to sing and perform.<br /><br />The New York, New York song was a winner in this concert. Liza's versatility to work with every song was superb and her more mature voice gave the audience the opportunity to have a real taste of talent. I only wished I was there to see her perform.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I first watched this when it was on HBO and I was totally captivated. I grew up during this time and while I could remember a lot of it, it was fascinating to see the whole story--as if I were experiencing it all over again, but this time as an adult behind the scenes. I remember being glued to the TV when Apollo 13 was out there and how it felt when they came back into contact. This was not only a walk down memory lane for me, but a tremendously educational experience.<br /><br />The actors are all perfect for their parts, and really excelled in their craft. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job on this project to the benefit of all who watch this miniseries for generations to come. I know I will watch it over and over again! Truly a worthwhile investment.

B000007MVM|3.0|So this was apparently done in Syd's break down, which yes it sounds like it but not in the way I would have guessed. Reading about this album online I guess I expected really bare bones, dark, songs with just acoustic guitar and vocals.  <br /> But for me anyways most all the songs come off as throw away Beatles songs when they were just too strung out. Most of the songs have a full (or mostly) full band and have some silly lyrics that don't make sense for me coming from the guy that pushed Floyd into the spacey, psychedelics sounds of their first few albums. Save for one song that was what I was hoping for, the rest of the album inset so much hard to listen to as just not pleasing or entertaining. <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|In 1987, the music industry was in a sad place(much as it is today!)All the 'Glam' rockers and 'Depressed Mode' fans had all their wet-dreams come true for them with their beloved music. Hard rockers were left with Whitesnake (not too bad) and the 'new' Van-Hagar album ( just really bad!)...What was about to happen surprised the sht out of everyone: Guns and Roses released 'Appetite for Destruction' and the world has never been the same. Never before has there ever been a hard-rock frontman like Axl.He is hands down the greatest and most talented heavy metal singer ever. Period. I first saw Guns OPEN for Aerosmith in 1988. Incredible! They almost upstaged the aging rockers.(My buddy and I also ran out of Jack Daniels) 20 years later, I just saw Axl and Izzy again (with all-new bandmates) this past December and I was completely blown away. He played almost all the tracks from 'Appetite'.The three brand new tracks from 'Chinese Democracy' were very exciting to hear after all this time. He has to finally release it !We  can't wait any longer. At 40-something, he's still got it and then some. The range his voice can reach is amazing. So is this landmark album. Every single track is pure and profane. Slash should forget the past and just shake hands already. Yes, Axl can be 'demanding' and 'difficult' to work with, but that is true of all great artists. Go back and remember where you were when you first heard this fine album then go and buy it on CD. You won't regret it !
B0000AQS6R|4.0|A Christmas classic must-have! I have always seen this movie on regular TV, so to see it on DVD with the original 'language' was fabulous!
B0007GAEGC|1.0|I absolutely love the music on this CD,except when it came to the seventh track. The music would not play at all.Apparently the CD is defective and if I ship it back it will cost me twice what it is worth. Very disappointed in this product. Will not order from this site again.
B00005UKE0|5.0|Songs like \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" were just a hint of things to come in 1969 when The Beatles recorded \\"Abbey Road\\". George had obviously been writing songs for a few years and stashing them away. \\"All Things Must Pass\\" came out only months after The Beatles broke up and took the world by storm. The original LP set had 3 LP's inside this beautiful boxed set with a poster. What it was, was a 2 LP set with a bonus LP that was recorded during the 2 LP set (called \\"Apple Jam\\", which basically had long blues/ rocking numbers with Clapton, Harrison and Dave Mason trading guitar licks) That made this a SIX sided record. This album contains some of the best solo Beatle music ever recorded. The two hit's \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"What is Life\\" are just the beginning. I would even go as far as to say that every song on this album is great songwriting. The sound is big and bold. Sometines a little too big but can easily be forgiven. It was co-produced by \\"Wall of Sound\\" producer Phil Spector. The only song I can justify calling a \\"filler\\" is \\"Isn't it a Pity\\"(Version 2). This album was #1 on the billboad charts for many weeks. It also has many famous artist's on like Eric Clapton and Billy Preston. There is a spitiual overtone throughout the album and pretty heavy lyrics. Personally, this album changed alot about the way I thought about life in general. If you want to hear what George was writing and working on while The Beatles were breaking up, I highly suggest this CD. It is timeless and a big mark in the history of Rock music.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|A very cute story with lots of talking animals that children adore.  It also teaches kids to think \\"out of the box\\" and that even a pig can be a sheepherder if he really wants to. We watch it over and over.
B000093001|5.0|As stated in the liner notes, this wasn't a tribute record , but a big Thank You to one of Gary's favorite guitarists.    Gary Moore has blazed a trail through the years like very few rock and blues guitarists can claim, but here Gary does a fine job of evoking the spirit of Peter Green's early work with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers as well as his work with his own Fleetwood Mac, music he himself experienced first hand as a teenager and later more closely sharing the bill with the Mac, and even getting the opportunity to purchase Peter Green's prized '59 Les Paul.    I would recommend this Import version as it has a better mix.
8186336141|5.0|I wrote a review of Light on Yoga, and talked about how if you could have only one text on hatha . . . Now, having seen this work, I must honestly revise that opinion.  Both this and the much better-known Light are first-rate books on hatha (physical) yoga.  This book, however, is quite user-friendly and much more informative about the effects of each asana.  It contains information about the chakras most directly affected by the asanas, and--importantly--it discusses the counterposes that are most effective for each asana described.  This last point is vital if you want to work toward structuring a practice without a class.   <br /> <br />This book does not contain nearly as many poses as Light.  And the poses are illustrated by drawings, not photos.  But the drawings are wonderfully clear.   <br /> <br />Like the title says, the book gives comprehensive insight into asana, pranayama, mudras and bandhas.  It leads the reader through a complete course and progression from beginner to advanced.  Advanced practitioners, though, can jump in anywhere and benefit from the book's insights, which are profound.   <br /> <br />For anyone serious about learning yoga or deepening one's practice, this is an essential text.  A wonderful complement to Light, and a stand-alone compendium that is sure to reward the reader, regardless of experience.
B00005KHEU|5.0|DISCOVERY is pretty solid album from beginning to end. Don't really understand why it gets such a bad rap about being a Disco album. It really isn't to me, except for a couple of songs being \\"SHINE A LITTLE LOVE\\" and \\"LAST TRAIN TO LONDON\\". Heck, it's funny how nobody considers OUT OF THE BLUE a Disco album either (which I don't, but whatever) since to me, \\"TURN TO STONE\\" and \\"SWEET TALKIN' WOMAN\\" sound kinda Disco. But these are great songs. And must people forget DISCOVERY was probably ELO's top selling albums when it was released. Besides it's a little hard to distinguish what you consider Disco and other wise when it comes to ELO. To me their music since the mid to late '70's pretty much had an elecro-rock sound to it which I like very much. Anyway, Get this album. You won't be disappointed, it's a fun listen and the remastered sound is fantastic!   Highlights: \\"SHINE A LITTLE LOVE\\",\\"CONFUSION\\",\\"DIARY OF HORACE WIMP\\",\\"LAST TRAIN TO LONDON\\",\\"DON'T BRING ME DOWN\\" and the bonus \\"LITTLE TOWN FLIRT\\"
B000I5X81K|2.0|I bought this at Costco and was hoping to be amazed by Josh Groban again but after listening to it, it was full of disappointment. I've been a fan of his since the first album but this third album is a bore, a complete bore. I couldn't connect with any of the songs, at least not as deeply as the first two albums. This new style was just not suitable for him. It's just not Josh.<br /><br />Although Track 2 \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" carried a nice message, the song, the melody, Josh's voice, it just didn't harmonized well enough.  The way the song was played was just not good.  Overall, listening to this album, there was something lacking in the songs. The only song I managed to like was the Romeo and Juliet song but all the rest was just boring.  I thought Josh would get better with each album but this is not one of his best work.  I think he lost his momentum from the last two albums.<br /><br />I rate this album Snoooze! Don't buy it, if you bought it, go for refund. Borrow it from the library if you want to try it.

6305161992|5.0|Scandic ubermensch Dolph Lundgren teams up with genetically-destined martial arts master Brandon Lee to deliver a short, hilarious and action-packed performance as two policemen fighting LA's merciless (and unintentionally campy)yakuza.  <br />As the two are initially paired we see their struggle to mesh their differing socio-historical views of Japanese culture, as Kenner (Dolph) tries to persuade Murata (Lee) of the intrinsic superiority of all things Japanese, from apparel to furniture (and women too, as proven by singer and \\"seppuku supporter\\" Miyako (Tia Carere), the inevitable love interest). <br />The pair confront new yakuza boss Yoshida and his clan as they plan to unleash on America drugs packaged in beer bottles so to allow Americans to enjoy both \\"our beer and our drugs while watching football\\" as Yoshida blissfully claims. <br />You will be entertained in seeing men breaking their own necks (and then, thanks to the magic that is cinema, appear in the subsequent scene very much alive), breasty blondes getting decapitated, bathtub fights, careless yakuza employees losing their fingers, katana swords and the unmistakable \\"male bonding\\" process that treats the viewer to dialogue that makes \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" seem like a manifest for heterosexuality in comparison. The dialogues are in fact the ace in the hole of this film: poignant, soulful and unforgettable (\\"Put the finger in the trash\\", \\"This time I heard you coming\\", the review title etc.). In the end the duo unleashes their vendetta on \\"oyabun\\" Yoshida, the man also responsible for making sashimi out of Kenner's parents when he was a child. <br />All in all, an interesting martial arts flick, some good fights, some original deaths and some phrases of sure interest for nostalgics of the American 80s action genre.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am from England and had not really been very interested in this show when I first heard about it. I saw the adverts and didn't think it was anything special. However, I was bored and tuned in to the pilot episode only to become totally hooked. I have not missed an episode since.  <br />I love the dynamic between the two brothers and it is that that keeps me watching. Both Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) just are the characters. <br />I recently purchased the Region One DVD, simply because I was fed up with the fact that over here we had no special features. I was very impressed with the prompt delivery. It arrived a week before the earliest delivery date! The special features were definately worth the wait. I look forward to seeing the second series when it starts over here.

B000FFJ85I|5.0|You can let the fact that A.F.I. make some of the freshest, most unique music of today overshadow the \\"sell-out\\" accusations delivered by bitter fans from the past. When the music is this good, this original, nothing else matters. You could say A.F.I. have treated their music to reach a broader audience, but really, they have just gotten better and better. Picking up three years after they dropped their breakthrough album, \\"Sing The Sorrow,\\" A Fire Inside have hardly missed a beat. \\"Decemberunderground\\" delivers on all expectations. A beautiful synth-pop/punk record that is as abrasive as it is melodic, as accessible as it is obtuse, A.F.I. are solidifying their reputation as a truly iconic band of our time.<br /><br />From the hand-clapped opening of \\"Prelude 12/21,\\" \\"Decemberunderground\\" is an album that you'll have difficulty putting down. If it's not the catchy first two singles, \\"Miss Murder\\" and \\"Love Like Winter,\\" it's the songs that draw obvious 80's pop influences, with their huge sing-along choruses, such as \\"Summer Shudder\\" and \\"37mm\\" that will seduce you. For fans of the older material, \\"Affliction\\" and \\"Kill Caustic\\" will serve you best, even if they sort of disrupt the flow of the album. \\"The Interview,\\" the most obvious ballad of the album, would make a nice third single, and will definitely linger in your mind the entire day after giving it one listen. The epic closing number, \\"Endlessly She Said,\\" is possibly one of the best moments of the album, combining the unique elements of all the songs preceeding it. Overall, all 12 tracks do well to create a certain mood that their peers strive for but can never acheive.<br /><br />\\"Decemberunderground,\\" which clocks in at 44 minutes and 44 seconds, and leaves you wanting more, is definitely a highlight of last year, and proves the band will be around for a long, long time. You can hate on them for changing, but it's all for the best. A.F.I. have always been different, definitely left of center, and this album doesn't change that. If you're looking for some modern retro music that doesn't get stale and actually introduces new elements, \\"Decemberunderground\\" is just as good as it gets.album doesn't change that.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale stars a new Bond, played by Daniel Craig. Forget what your opinion is after viewing the commercials or reading the press, Craig is Bond through and through. Also, you'll view him as Bond, but you'll be able to separate him from the other actors. This movie is a reboot of the series. It takes you back to before Bond became the Bond we know and love. This movie shows his formation. The movie doesn't show Bond after Brosnan, it shows him before Connery. Starting with Goldeneye, I told myself that, \\"man, that movie was awesome,\\" because it was a Bond movie, and they just HAD to be awesome didn't they? Well, some of the recent ones were good. Some weren't (I haven't seen Die Another Day completely since the theaters.  It seems so cartoonish). Craig's Bond is different. He makes mistakes. He doesn't think things through. It's fun to see his mistakes and know the experienced Bond wouldn't do those things. At one moment, when it looks like Bond has failed, Bond is ready to strike back and kill, when common sense says he should do something else. Only other, more experienced spies can stop him, and they do.<br /><br />So, with the movie fresh on my mind, I think this is one of the best, and I think that opinion will hold up through time. For starters, this movie isn't about a laser pulse that can destroy electricity, an atomic bomb that will blow up Hong Kong or the oil supply, or a machine that can harness the sun. This movie is about a man who finances the world's terrorists and in order to raise money, he's hosting a poker game. It's a simple spy story. As said before, Craig is awesome. The one-liners and puns aren't as blatant as earlier movies, but Bond is still witty. He also cares a lot, is more human, and suffers some remorse at the actions his jobs call him to do. This Bond is on the verge. At times, he shows heart and compassion, and at times he can be cold blooded. The person that can draw him out is the beautiful Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green. Eva Green is beautiful, as a scene shown where she stands in front of the mirror without makeup will prove, her face is perfect. (I caught a glimpse of her in the movie Dreamers on the Independent Film Channel, and the rest of her isn't bad either.) She is tough, yet vulnerable, and her character will leave a mark on you for awhile.<br /><br />Now, what makes this a great \\"Bond\\" movie, and not just a great action movie. As far as the action goes, it is great stuff. There are fights on cranes, in stairwells, in collapsing buildings and at airports. Bond fans will want to know, does the movie have the stuff that makes Bond movies great?<br /><br />Considering the music, and specifically the Bond theme, many people say Goldeneye is one of the best Bond movies. I specifically remember that movie as being one that went away from the traditional Bond theme. They didn't use it once! So while it might have been a good movie, it was a poor Bond movie. In this film, the Bond music is there, though not as much as usual. But you can expect that, because Bond doesn't become \\"Bond\\" until the end. The traditional \\"gun-barrel\\" opening is also a bond staple, something that usually opens every Bond film. This movie opens without it, and I was disappointed, but then it is showcased in a different way, and that makes it even better. As mentioned above, the wit is there, just not focused upon as much.<br /><br />This is an intense PG-13, movie. There is not any nudity, despite what the MPAA says. The language is fine, the violence is plentiful, but not gory. I echo other reviews I've read when I say I'm ready for a sequel. This is the kind of movie that could start a series, even if it was the first, not the 21st. I hope this movie makes gobs of money because it is that much better than Die Another Day.Eva Green is beautiful, as a scene shown where she stands in front of the mirror without makeup will prove, her face is perfect.

0060007737|4.0|Books by Al Ries and Jack Trout are always worth a read.  These marketing specialists are perhaps best known for their seminal work \\"Positioning\\".  They have written several books together and also gone out on their own. <br /> <br />In this book, \\"The 22 immutable laws of Branding\\", the Ries/Trout partnership is broken, and instead it's Ries/Ries, Father and Daughter. <br /> <br />We are presented with 22 short chapters on what Ries considers to be immutable laws.  E.g. The first law, \\"The law of Expansion\\" states that the power of a brand is inversely proportional to its scope.  Each chapter is introduced with a one page company logo and brief description on transgression or adherance to the law.  The Law of expansion uses chevrolet as the example, stating that by trying to be all things to all men, it undermined its brand.  The chapter then continues in giving further analysis of that company and also illustrating other examples to back up the law. <br /> <br />As with all books by All Ries, or Jack Trout, this book is highly readable.  The analysis is not indepth, but the concepts are easy and clear to understand.  The chapters are short enough to read 5-10 minutes, and do not have to be read in order. <br /> <br />One criticism of the book is that it tends to state the same ideas in several different ways.  Essentially the author's message is the same as in the classic \\"Positioning\\" - find a unique space in the mind of the customer for your company/brand, beware of product line extensions/brand extensions. <br /> <br />4 stars
B00005MP58|5.0|The beauty of Pride and Prejudice, always a timeless piece of literature, is captured in the film through outstanding cinematography and superb acting on the part of all characters.  Colin Firth does his usual outstanding performance as his character captures so well the vagaries of his nascent relationship and his inability to determine where he sees himself in English society of the period.  If viewers wish to recapture the feelings and imagery of this historical period, Pride and Prejudice will offer satisfaction.
B00005JPKE|1.0|First, I know I will sound like a jerk, I am not. I helped carry a wounded in vietnam father off a plane in 1965. I give to the local VA hospital that cares for our wounded Vets from Iraq. I am a conservative hippy. I believe one should always support their country, and their government WHEN IT DESERVES IT.. I have talked to many a WWII vets about this film, and NONE admires or is sad about the suffering of the Japanese soldier in this film.  They like me, are glad they rot entombed forever in caves on Iwo Jima or died above ground on that soil. Of course the Japanese soldier wrote sorrowful, compelling, sad good byes to their families. So does a serial killer in their trials! Their tears, the I am sorry for the pain I caused they will say. But only because they were caught and now about to be punished forever... Otherwise they would have continued their rampage!! Had the Japanes landed on USA soil and successful invaded the USA,we would have been tortured, slaughtered, killed and enslaved by these horrible humans. I feel no sorrow for these soldiers, their leaders or families.. Ok we can blame their teaching from cradle to grave. So be it...The Japanese during this era were cruel, sinful, mass murderers, and unremorsefull people. I wish Clint had never made this film..... Some wonderful reviews were written about this being a anti war film, etc. Easy to say now... Had the Japanese won the war I assure you, the Iwo Jima baker would have slaughtered and bayoneted babies on USA soil given the opportunity. Shed no tears for them.   I burned my 2 CDs/box in the fireplace.   Vintage Man
B000IYV1ME|4.0|This movie is a movie for thinkers. It is not an action packed super hero jumping thru the window movie. If you are looking for action look elsewhere. What is so scary about this movie is how true to fact it could be. I had to watch the movie 2 times to pick up on all that is going on with it. So If you don't have a short attention span and you like current events. You will like this movie. It isn't for everyone but Those who like it really like it.

B00004W4UB|4.0|This movie has an interesting twist on the classic horror film. We are able to watch what transpires within the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the view of a chambermaid's perspective. This chambermaid, Mary Reilly, is played quite well by Julia Roberts. Mary Reilly is a poor girl who had a horrible childhood and feels the safety of security brought about by working in the house of a rich and distinguished doctor. Of course unlike normal servants of the time, she is able to read and becomes very inquisitive about her masters business. Mr. John Malkovich does a perfect job of showing the ongoing conflict between good and evil contained within each of us in his portrayal of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. As the good doctor he is a kindly man of science. But as Mr. Hyde all his inhabitations are gone, as are his morals and conscience. <br /> <br />This film takes the horror film and turns into a film that keeps you suspended in the dark as you watch the mystery unfold for the chambermaid. The movie is not a true classic horror film or one of the modern films of gore. Do not expect to be frighten and do not be surprised when the audience seems to be the only ones that can see it is obvious that Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde. Other then that, both leads give a satisfactory performance and the film is worth watching. <br />
B000HIVQLW|5.0|The first couple of songs dint need to be there but the rest were cool.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|I first heard about this movie on \\"Ebert and Roper\\".  Months later three or four different people recommended I see this \\"very entertaining movie\\" called \\"little Miss Sunshine\\".  I watched it and though I was not bowled over with the idea of how great a movie it was I certainly laughed in many places and was surprised by the talent segment in the pageant scene.  <br /> <br />It seems to me the genius of the movie is that the screen writer and the director told a story about a foul mouthed, heroin sniffing Grandfather, who (and this only my opinion) was probably molesting his Granddaughter and they managed to get people to enjoy the tale like it was a Disney feel good movie. That is one hell of a trick. <br /> <br />The thought that Alan Arkin's character might be molesting his grandchild popped into my head when I realized he was sharing a hotel room with his Granddaughter.  Grandpa had just given his Gay relative money and asked him to purchase some porn magazines for him in the scene before.  I'm sure that he was reading them for the articles but since the family was on the road to the pageant, and not on the way back home, the only logical place he would be able to \\"Read them\\" was in his hotel room.  Those magazines (and previous statements to the Grandson about \\"Having ses with as many women as possible...Etc...ETC...\\") made his statements in the hotel room a little suspect.  When the granddaughter asks if she is pretty he says she is beautiful and that he is completely in love with her. He then states the reason why is not because of her brain, or her personality, but because she of how beautiful she is.  Those words made his view of his grandaughter sound the same as men view of women in porn. Strange that a Grandfather would say that his love of his granddaughter was based only on physical beauty.  <br /> <br />I dismissed those thoughts as overthinking especially after his character passed away but low and behold at the end of the movie Grandpa's private dancer lessons with the granddaughter surfaces to the music of Rick James' \\"Super Freak\\"
B000003N7K|5.0|They all say it's wonderful and, wow, it really is...<br /><br />Showing Coltrane's mellow and romantic side (also seen on his \\"My Favorite Things\\"), this album brings the great and precise vocalist Hartman into Coltrane's classical band and together they create something so delicate and subtle I hardly believed it when I heard it. This means that Tyner's intelligent piano and Garrison's and Jones' unobtrusive rhytmical support are also essential for this musical triumph.<br /><br />Is it modern jazz? Is it musically conservative? Answers to both questions should probably be in the affirmative; great music is often too complex to be placed in neatly divided groups...<br /><br />Coltrane's tone is, I must admit, far from being among my favorite sounds in jazz, but on this album even that aspect of his music pleases me very much. He is as light and full of innuendos as the tone of Johnny Hodges, Paul Desmond and Lester Young at their most breazy and mellow, but at the same time the Trane is still strong and autoritative in creating his solos and obligattos.<br /><br />If I repeat some words in this clumsy description, it is not just because English is not my mother tongue: no language can trully explain these subtle sounds and emotions; only a lyrical poem could suffice (and I'm no poet).<br />Just listen how Hartman merges with Coltrane and his band from the beginning of \\"You are too beautiful ...\\". A true object of beauty.

This is only the second Hercule Poirot mystery that I have picked up and I feel that I am just getting started on what will be a long and fabulous love affair with Agatha Christie's works. I'm sorry that I read so fast though. Death on the Nile, while considerably longer than 'Orient Express', was over too quickly for me. What I love best about the outcome of this mystery was that I had a sneaking suspicion all along what was happening, but so many twists and turns in the plot kept me second-guessing right up until the end. Really a great read.

0399226907|5.0|This classic book by Eric Carle is one of my top ten children's books of all time. It's a highly appealing, colorful story that a child can enjoy from infancy through the preschool years. It's visually appealing, and the story is simple enough to engage babies and toddlers.  Because it also incorporates counting and the days of the week, it's a great concept book for older toddlers and preschoolers.  Older preschoolers will enjoy the entertaining list of all the foods the little caterpillar gobbles down.  My son always groans sympathetically when the caterpillar overdoes it and gets a stomachache.  An enduring favorite.

Seeing this series with songs that you don't eaven know who is singing.  <br />I just saw the pilot episode, i couldn't see the rest of it. It's really, really bad. Where is \\"Motion of love\\" when Brenda gets inside the disco all by herself ??????  Where are Technotronic, Transvision Vamp, where is Chris Isaak, REM, Betty Boo ??????  We waited a long time for this dvds and all we get is this piece of junk. Who did this and why????  Don't purchase this dvds. They are not worht your money. The bootlegs are better !!!!

B00003CXI1|5.0|... this is probably the best one. It captivates the audience with the magic and dreams of a young boy (Harry Potter) finally learning who he really is -- and discovering that he is something special.<br /><br />As is generally the nature of the film business, sequels never quite match up to the pilot film. This is not to say that \\"Chamber\\", \\"Prisoner\\" and \\"Goblet\\" were not good movies; they were. This is simply better.<br /><br />The story takes us on a tour of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft -- as unlikely place as any in the realm of fiction -- and introduces us to some delightful characters. The sanguine master, Professor Dumbledore; loyal and gentle giant, Hagrid; sinister and sulking, Professor Snape; and of course the main characters, Harry, Hermione and Ronald Wesley.<br /><br />Harry is singled out almost immediately as exceptional and develops a continuing advisary in the guise of Draco Malfoy. Draco represents everything Harry is not. He comes from a wealthy, well-known family; has influence, is arrogant and is sure of himself. In the sequels we come to know him a bit better (and dislike him even more) but even in the first film, he reminds us of the kid in school we always hated (envied?).<br /><br />The imagination runs wild as Harry and his new friends discover many delightful objects and puzzle over situations. The mirror that shows one's innermost desires, a trek thru the dark forest to look for unicorns, fluffy the three-headed dog, wizard's chess, and the mystery of the sorcerer's stone itself.<br /><br />The music score well fits the scenes depicted and tends to be on the light side. Characters are well played and believable (within the realm of the story at least). And the ending - if not a surprise - is at least not a letdown. One finishes the film smacking his lips in anticipation of the next release.<br /><br />This is a movie to be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. Adults will marvel at the special effects and probably remember their own childhood experiences in school. Kids will delight to the characters and the many devices throughout the film. The action is mild enough that even the youngest of children can watch without parents having to worry about language or violence.<br /><br />Want a good evening's entertainment with the family in front of the television. You can't go wrong with this one.<br /><br />*** Highly Recommended ***<br />~pjm~to the characters and the many devices throughout the film.

B00005JP9V|1.0|While I will agree that the underlying plot is original and the film is visually well done, I cannot agree that the movie is good. The book did not translate well to the big screen. Partly because you can never capture all of the character background and sub plots. <br /> <br />In addition, the movie just isn't boring and dull, Clive Owens performance is fairly sterile. I am not sure what movie one of the other reviewers watched, but Clive never came across as hopeful as the story progressed from a future of hopelessness to one of potential. The only performance that was solid in this movie was Michael Caine's portrayal of a hippy in 2027. I am still not sure why Julianne Moore decided to play her part but it was quite unremarkable in anyway. <br /> <br />Bottom line, the cinematography is incredible (like Full metal Jacket), the acting average, and the editing average as well. It makes for a dull two hours, which could have been very intense and surreal had they connected all the dots. <br /> <br />

B0002O7Y8K|5.0|I like to think of the novel's premise as genealogy really going to someone's head.  When John Durbeyfield is informed by the town historian that his family used to be a noble one (and the original name was \\"D'Urberville\\"), he sends his daughter Tess (Teresa) to rich relatives in the English countryside for financial help.  It's there that she meets with Alec D'Urberville, effectively beginning a downward spiral for everyone concerned.<br /><br />As always, one can trust a book adaptation in Roman Polanski's more than capable hands.  He faithfully adapted Ira Levin's \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" in 1968 and Roland Topor's \\"The Tenant\\" in 1976 before tackling Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" in 1979.<br /><br />It's common knowledge that Roman adapted the book to honor Sharon Tate's memory (it was reportedly the last book she read.  She put a copy on his night-table with a note suggesting that it would make a good movie).  The continuous personal attacks on him are really unnecessary (and, f.y.i., they make the attacker look really dumb ... especially when their missive is a grammatical masterpiece).<br /><br />For having just learned English during preparation for her role in the title part, Natassja Kinski managed very well.  She conveyed the vulnerable and melancholy Tess appropriately.  At times during the course of the movie, one can almost feel themselves being sucked into Tess's depressing vortex, snapping out of it with her ... only to fall right back in again.<br /><br />Leigh Lawson played a right-on Alec D'Urberville.  He was the monster I envisioned Alec to be while reading Hardy's novel.  Peter Firth as Angel was also excellent in his role.  Roman nailed the English countryside dialect and he always does a fantastic job with Victorian England scenery (he repeated that success with 2005's \\"Oliver Twist\\").<br /><br />Roman did an excellent job, as always, with \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles.\\"  The book could be adapted a thousand times after his version and they still couldn't match up to his vision.  Roman took Thomas Hardy's always depressing vision and turned it into a beautiful movie (for further proof of Hardy's depressive novels, check out his final book, \\"Jude the Obscure\\").<br /><br />The DVD and Book collection series was a great idea to try to get people to read the classics alongside the movie.<br /><br />\\"Tess\\" is a must-have for the DVD collection.  - Donna Di Giacomoo his vision.

0553579908|5.0|In the second volume of his epic series, GRRM draws the reader deeper still into the epic story that was begun in Game of thrones. From the first chapter until the very end I would defy any reader to not find themselves completely enthralled by the tale. This is the series to read if you are tired of the same old books that the fantasy genre usually churns out, and even if you aren't this series will make you expect so much more from all other books. <br /> <br />A Clash of King's takes up where a Game of thrones left us hanging suspensfully. The Death of Robert has also meant the death of the delicate balance that ruled the country for years, five men who call themselves kings are tearing the kingdom apart with their battles, leaving the smallfolk's blood to run as well as their own nobles'. Meanwhile the Stark pack is scattered across the kingdom. Robb, sits in riverrun with his mother, warring against his enemies. Sansa remains captive of the terrible Lions of Lannisters. Arya roams the dangerous war torn midlands with a new pack, this time made up of thieves, murderer, rapists and prphan boys who are more than meets the eye. Bran and Rickon dwell in the illusory safety of the great northern fortress of winterfell. And Jon Snow roams the perilous lands beyond the wall, the ends of the earth. <br />Tyrion, the imp of Lannister, must meanwhile play games of intrigue against his sister and the spiders which surround her, trying to fend off wolves and stags while seeking to free his brother the Kingslayer. <br />And on the other side of the sea Daenerys Staromborn, last of the Targaryens and mother of the only three dragons in the world, must carve her destiny out of the savage free cities in order to have her vengence and the western country she think to be her birth right. <br /> <br />GRRM's tale of good and evil is made so much more compelling by the blurry line which seperates the two, and which characters drift back and forth over. This is a story of war, vengence, violence, sorrow, love and hate that no one should have to miss out on.

B00007AJGH|5.0|Eddie Valiant is a detective who doesn't really like 'toons. Toons are cartoon characters come to life, working in painted studios like actors in Hollywood. They killed Eddie's brother Theodore a few years ago, dropped a piano on his head. Still, Eddie needs the money, so he takes a job for R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoons. Their star Roger Rabbit keeps stuffing up their animated shorts because he's so in love with Jessica Rabbit, his wife. Valiant goes and breaks it up, by way of some dirty pictures of Jessica Rabbit and a Marvin Acme, and Roger gets upset. The next day, Acme is killed, and Roger is the suspect. The Judge of Toontown wants Roger destroyed, and Eddie smells a rat. What's really going on? <br /> <br />\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" pretty stylish film, with a pretty good cast (I love Bob Hoskins as Detective Valiant in this, and Christopher Lloyd as the Judge). The mystery of the story is pretty interesting too, as is seeing Disney and Warner Bros characters together. Worth a look.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Sorry, Mr. Connery. Your portrayal of agent 007 is legendary. You introduced us to Bond and you made it yours to the point that you became the embodiment of the character. That's history. Enter Daniel Craig. Yes, he's blond but he doesn't require a hairpiece -- again, sorry Sir Connery. Yes, he's a bit shorter than all of the Bond actors before him but he makes up in the stature of his charisma and sheer machismo. Yes, he's the best actor to every play the role. And, yes, he's the best James Bond ever. That is not to diss Brosnan, Dalton, Moore or even Lazenby. They all did a great job. But Craig just becomes Bond literally the minute you see him onscreen. Ian Fleming must be smiling up in heaven. \\"That's it, young chap. You've got it,\\" he must have said to himself watching Casino Royale at the Saint Peter's cinema on the corner of Celestial Path and Jesus Road. Nobody has done it better ...
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Just finished Season 3 of Star Trek Enterprise and wow!!!!! This Star Trek series is not like the other Star Trek epics (from Captain Kirk onwards), and does not keep up with the series tradition of soft-core Sci-fi. This series has lots of people dying and lots of blood splattered around!!!! Casualties are high at an unprecedented level for any Star Trek show. And with a deviation from the previous Star trek tradition, lots of sexual suggestions; some indecent episodes, and tacky sexploitation of T'Pol (Jolene Blalock). Definitely not for children! For example, T'Pol taking showers; removing her clothes for bio-scans; massage sessions with Commander Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and her intense sexual urges. I think the producers are searching for a new audience. Even the good guys die! And the Vulcan T'Pol has weaknesses, unlike Spot.     Furthermore, each episode follows on the previous episode, sort of like Kiefer Sutherland's 24. This is unique in this series of Star Treks. Usually, each episode of the previous Star Trek sagas was independent of each other. One used to be able to watch any of the previous Star Trek episodes without being lost as to what is going on. With Season 3 of Enterprise, however, you'd have to pretty much start with episode one to really understand what is going on and enjoy the series (again, like 24 or Lost).     The whole season revolves around one story: how to stop the Xindi from destroying planet Earth! The Xindi, a race made up of 5 surviving species (Primates, Arboreals, Reptilians, Aquatics and Insectoids), aided by a species from a trans-dimensional space, have attacked Earth and killed seven million people. The attack came from the Delphic Expanse, an unstable region of space where our laws of physics are non-existent. The Enterprise's mission: enter the Expanse, find the Xindi, and prevent them from deploying the weapon that is being designed to destroy Earth. This storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you hungerfor more.    Finally the producers figured it out (much to Manny Coto's credit)! They are starting to copy series like 24 and Lost!      Season 3 is really exciting and action packed; more so than any of the previous series from Kirk onwards. Note though that this intense action and having each episode follow on the previous one, starts only with Season 3. Season 1 and 2 were bland and much like their predecessors.     I highly recommend Season 3, and can't wait to watch Season 4.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|I used to own a copy of this before they made the \\"Director's Cut\\" and I loved it. Very artistic and well made. However, in this new version they have added video and photographs in places that interfere with the whole feel of the show. The slow zooms in and out at the beginning and end of the film are interrupted with added clips of space scenes. There is even some computer animation thrown in somewhere of what appears to be a model of what Pompeii may have looked like before its destruction. While all this is fine and dandy, I think they ruined the whole feel of the film by trying to modernize it. Masterpieces should be left alone! Buy the original, not the \\"Director's Cut\\".
B000000HHE|5.0|De La Soul's (consisting of Posdnuos, Maceo, and Trugoy)1989 debut \\"3 Feet High And Rising\\" is considered one of the most important debuts in music history. I have to agree with that statement. Me, this album is nothing but music to have fun while listening to. A lot of their albums are remerable to come across. There is not much I can say here that hasn't already have been said here.<br /><br />This album has a lot of remerable tracks on here. I would say their biggest one would be \\"Me Myself And I\\", and it sounds so fresh today as if I were listening to it back in '89. A lot of their tracks that they made, people thought they were hippies, but that would be addressed throughout this album. Most of their music is just to make you laugh and have fun, like on one of the interludes \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\".<br /><br />This album is completely produced by Prince Paul (one of the most underrated producers). The song \\"Eye Know\\" has one of the most fantastic beats that I heard in a while, especially when it comes to me listening to albums from the 80's. \\"The Magic Number\\" is also a great beat to enjoy.<br /><br />And if you purchased this after 2001, you receive a bonus disc. The bonus disc contains eight tracks that were either remixes or pulled off of soundtracks. A great addition towards this album if you ask me.<br /><br />As for anything to have any problems about, I have only one. I'm kinda mad that the remix of \\"Buddy\\" is not on here, nor on the bonus disc. That is a small dissapointment, but I will learn to live with it. Other than that, this is an album that you will enjoy time and time again. De La Soul debut is sort of like party music, but at the same time, make you daydream. This is one album that is highly recommend to any music listener from any genre.

B0002XNSY0|5.0|Peter Sellers is ridiculouly good as three different characters in Master Stanley Kubrick's disturbingly hillarious black comedy \\"Dr.Strangelove:or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb\\". For me when I watch this film it's actually a little more on the disturbing side than funny because it's really not so far fetched,both back when it was made and in the present time. Dr.Strangelove is presented in black & white but is wildly colorful in it's witty content. This is truly a must have for Kubrick fans and anyone who has half a brain and a sense of humor. In these dark & scary times we are living in today where the apocolypse seems to be poking it's inevitable head around each corner this film seems to be both relevent & appropriate.
B000002WPI|5.0|Dang, what can I say that hasn't been said already here on these reviews. Wu-Tang debuted in 1993 (they dropped a few singles as a group in 1992) witht their Classic album \\"Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)\\". Straight up: This album is hardcore hip hop music from the 90's, plain and simple. So many classic tracks on here that really made an impact on the show \\"Yo! MTV Raps\\"...back when MTV played great quality music. I believe the single that got the most spins was the historically \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\", and if you don't know what that means, I suggest you look it up.<br /><br />Each member came with a vengance. I'd say the best few on here were Inspetah Deck, Method Man (to think both members were hardcore at one point), and The Genius (aka GZA or Gizah)(who lyrically murders the song \\"Clan In Da Front\\"). ODB, RZA, U-God, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, and Masta Killa (who only appears in one song) also come on strong as well, but they would reach higher potential years later.<br /><br />Aside from \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\" another one of my favorite tracks is \\"The Mystery Of Chessboxing\\" the only track where Masta Killa appears on. \\"Ain't Nothin' Ta F With\\" is another sick song. Method Man would get his own start on the solo tip with his self titled song \\"Method Man\\". Production is excellent. Back then, anything that came from the Wu was garunteed to me excellent in the production area.<br /><br />If you heard this CD is a classic, you heard correct. Whether if it is excellent production, hardcore rhymes, this album has it all. Wu would start a legacy and gain many hardcore fans. This is the second Wu album that I purchased (the first was \\"Iron Flag\\"), and I for one am glad that I have this. 12 tracks deep, there is not one skippable track on here. If you are new to the Wu-Tang, start here. In fact, I recommend anything Wu related up until 1997.

B000002J1U|5.0|In some ways it's very strange that Led Zepplin 3 gets so little recognition compared to Led Zeppelin's other records. Why do i say this? Because, chronologically, this album is right smack in the middle of Led Zeppelin's 4 mega records (1,2,untitled, and houses of the holy, not to mention Physical Graffiti). Then again when listeing to this album it's easy to see why maybe this one wasn't and isn't as popular. It certainly is a different record then the other ones that surround it. Different because it is not as heavy, and relies much more on the acoustic guitar. However, it is still pure Led Zeppelin. Unlike Zep's last two efforts, 3 still has that hardcore blues taste with a metalic twist on it that only Zepplein could provide. In fact, now that i think about, this album really should be rated just as high as their other 5. <br /> <br />At one point, I would often skip this one when listeing to my rotation of Zeppelin albums. I had always ignored it because of what other people said and because of a couple unattentive listenings. But after getting tired of listening to the same Led Zeppelin album, 3 along with \\"In through the out door\\" began to grow on me. Now i can't stop listeing to either of them. The same thing happened to me with the doors' waiting for the sun and soft parade.  <br /> <br />Anyway, about this record, not one of these songs is weak, even the seemingly (among my friends at least) unpopular \\"Hats off to Roy Harper\\". Sure this song is a little weird, but i just can't help but sing-along with its great bluesy feel. Immigrant Song and Since I've been Lovin you are obviously classics, and Out on the tiles is a very underrated riff from Page n' company. Friends/Celebration Day is excellent as well. But the best songs from this masterpiece are the 4 acoustic pieces that i have yet to mention, two of them are ballads, and two are fast paced, honky, tonky, whatever you want to call them, go getters. I'm talking about (take me to the) GALLOWS POLE. A great song which gets faster and faster and makes you want to just clap and tap your feet like theres no tomorrow. Bron-Yr-Aur STOMP has a similar effect, as you can tell by the title. And the other songs i need to mention are Tangerine and That's the way, two wonderful ballads that are really Led's most underrated pieces. When the dust settles, that is to say after you've heard the likes of Stairway to heaven, all my love, and Ten Years Gone, these two here are this band's truly masterful ballads. I want to go in to how beautiful they are but it's just too difficult to describe. So instead i'm just gonna tell you to buy this album if you know some Led Zeppelin stuff. If you don't you should probably start out with something more Zeppy like 1,2 or untitled, but eventually you won't be able to deny the intrigue of Led Zepplein 3, its fascinating cover, and its peculiar absence from the discussion of immortal rock albums.

B00005JPKC|5.0|There have been more movies about World War II than any other subject I can think of. Seriously, I think that if it weren't for Shakespear, WWII would be the favorite topic in Hollywood to make a film about. These movies are about a popular topic, feature lots of violence, and usually walk away with a truckload of Oscars. \\"Letter From Iwo Jima\\" is one of these movies but with one very crucial twist: It takes place from the point of view of the Japanese army. It's a few days before the famous battle at Iwo Jima and the Japanese army, led by General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), are tasted with the unfavorable task of having to defend Iwo Jima from the American's. They know the American's will attempt to take over the island, but no one wants to fight them.<br /><br />After all the Japanese are outnumbered, have weapons that pale to America's technology, and no reinforcements are coming. This is a battle to the death. If they die, they die with honor. The soldiers dig trenches and prepare for the upcoming battle, all while they write letters to their loved ones, who many know they most likely will never see again. The character we follow the most is Saigo, who was a humble baker who was forced into joining the army while he left his wife, Hanako, alone to give birth to their child. When he digs a trench, he writes to his wife \\"I feel like I am digging my own grave.\\" The letters prove to be the most emotionally gripping scenes in the movie, as the character narrate the letters they are writing. The letters explain their feelings, thoughts, and regrets in life.<br /><br />Since the movie takes place from the Japanese point of view, you'd expect the movie to be very slanted and biased towards American's. This could not be farther from the truth. While a couple of American's are shown as brutes, all the soldiers in this movie are seen as young men who are simply doing their duty. After one American soldier gets shot by a Japanese general, the general has his wounds treated and forms a bond with the American, who is named Sam. General Kuribayashi serves his country with honor, but having been deemed a friend of the American's (with a custom made pistol to boot), Kuribayashi is conflicted about having to kill his friends. When the battle actually starts it's everything you expect it to be: Bloody, violent, and so fast paced it's hard to see what's going on sometimes.<br /><br />But the movie also takes time to share quiet moments with the Japanese soldiers, including one soldier who gains respect for the American's after he has had to kill some. Seeing 2006's \\"other\\" Iwo Jima movie, \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" helped me with my enjoyment of this movie greatly. Keep in mind, I didn't particularly like \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" very much (I gave it two and a half stars). I thought it was too long, there was too much focus on the battle of Iwo Jima (the story about the flag propaganda was far more interesting), and I felt that the movie just didn't have the sort of \\"heart\\" that's required to make a great war film. This movie does have the heart that \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" lacked, and in a couple of pivotal scenes, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" become one whole film with one uniting message. Watching both films heighten my appreciation not only for this film, but for \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\"<br /><br />As I watched this film I couldn't help but find myself respecting the Japanese soldiers who fought at Iwo Jima. Oh sure, I can't say I was rooting for them. They were on Hitler's side during this battle, and they certainly killed many of my fellow American's during this time period. But they had honor, bravery, and they were doing exactly what we were doing, which was serving their country. I may not ever understand the whole suicide thing they did when things went wrong, but I commend that they were brave soldiers in this war. I hope people don't skip this film just because the thought of reading subtitles scare them.This is a stupid reason to not see a movie, and it's particularly a stupid reason not to see this film. \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" is one of the best films of the year. In fact, it's one of the few perfect films I've ever seen.<br /><br />Rating: ***** Starse them.

B000002LOE|2.0|For someone like me who had been onboard the REM Express since the early days, \\"Out of Time\\" served as my cue to now exit the train.  As if enlisting the help of KRS-One on \\"Radio Song\\" wasn't bad enough (no disrespect to KRS, BDP were fantastic in their own right and you were simply helping REM put lipstick on a pig), Stipe and the boys dragged a B-52 onboard for \\"Shiny Happy People\\".  What resulted was the band's most pathetic recording to date.  If this album represents your first exposure to REM and you liked what you heard, then pay no attention to this review or any REM records prior to \\"Green\\".  However if you cut your teeth on \\"Radio Free Europe\\" and \\"Seven Chinese Brothers\\", then don't be alarmed when blood pours out of your ears after listening to this album...the very definition of a \\"Traveshamockery\\".
B00005JPE7|4.0|Everyone's favorite underdog is back in the game, as Sylvester Stallone brings back the character that made him a household name in the first place, with the sixth entry is the popular Rocky series \\"Rocky Balboa\\" (apparently, Roman numerals are no long in). Going into \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is like walking into a bad teenage comedy, as you go in with low expectations and more then a little cynicism. Yeah, sure, the original \\"Rocky\\" was critically acclaimed and won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but that was in 1976. This is 2006. That's about...a thirty year gap between the original movie and the current one. And Stallone is now sixty. Can he really pull off acting young anymore? The answer is no, so Stallone doesn't even try. Instead of pretending he's still 22, Stallone has Rocky retired at the age of 62, who is running a successful restaurant but has a strained relationship with his son ever since his wife died of causes that are not revealed in the film.<br /><br />Then one of those computer simulators sets up a virtual fight with Rocky fighting the current heavy weight champion of the world Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon. The computer deems Rocky would win in a fight, which gets Rocky into wondering what it would be like to get back into fighting. Rocky doesn't consider getting back in the ring for glory or fame, but more for the fact that he's somewhat stuck in time and wants the past back. Rocky constantly visits places he and Adrian used to visit, much to his brother-in-law's frustration. \\"You're problem is that you're living in the past. But I can't do that anymore,\\" Pauli tells Rocky on the anniversary of Adrians death. For once, Pauli actually comes off as the wise one. Everything in Rocky's life is about the past. Rocky may own a restaurant (named Adrians appropriately enough), but Rocky doesn't actually manage the business or cook the food, he just dresses up in a nice suit and tells the costumers stories of his boxing career, taking a photo once in awhile.<br /><br />His son loves his dad, but is frustrated that he passes through life based on the fact that he is the son of a former heavy weight champion. Even Rocky's friend Marie, the girl he walked home near the beginning of the first movie, is helped by Rocky mainly because Rocky can see the results of something good he did in the past. When the opportunity to fight Mason comes to Rocky's table, he accepts the fight because he wants to put the past behind him. In a phrase that will most likely become one of the most popular lines of dialog in history, Rocky tells his son \\"Life's not about how many punches you can throw at it, it's about how many times you can get hit and continue to punch back.\\" When we finally get to the big fight, Rocky is once again an underdog. No longer young, looking a little frail, but with just enough determination that you can't help but hope he wins.<br /><br />Yet the road will not be easy. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" delivers everything you expect a Rocky movie to have, from inspirational speeches, to a training montage, to spouts with minor characters. All of this we expect, yet it feels fresh and interesting. The characters have something to say to each other, and the storyline is very human and personal. I was amazed by how involved I got with these characters, considering that I haven't really spent any time with them in years, and all of them look completely different then when I last saw them. When Rocky first ran up those stairs and lifted his fists in the air, he was saying something to the world. Now he's saying something else, and it's just as inspiring as the last thing he had to say. By bringing Rocky down to our level, and dealing with the issue's we've all been joking about, Rocky becomes the underdog once again, and we're only happy to root for him some more. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />Rating: **** and a half stars/> <br />His son loves his dad, but is frustrated that he passes through life based on the fact that he is the son of a former heavy weight champion.

B000002LK1|4.0|\\"Violator\\" is probably the first Depeche Mode album that would generally appeal to a wide array of listeners.  While DM's previous offerings were showing steady improvement, it wasn't until this record that the band seemed to strike a chord between their electronically-dominated sound and melodies that hooked and reeled you in.  Violator is full of catchy lyrics and contains arguably Depeche Mode's most mainstream hits, however it was still a natural progression from 1987's \\"Music For The Masses.\\"  This was the first CD I ever owned, and I still hold it in high regard...\\"Violator\\" is very solid from start to finish.
B00005JOLI|1.0|Ever since 2001 fantasy films have been huge for movie theater business. That was the year that produced both \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" as well as \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and managed to make almost two billion dollars combined. Since \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films are finished and the Harry Potter films on their way, new properties need to be looked at to keep the genre alive. It's easy to see why \\"Eragon\\" was green-lit: Some executive at Fox saw that this book about dragons written by a 15 year old was selling tons of copies, and decided to buy himself a new franchise. If Fox isn't careful though, \\"Eragon\\" could easily destroy the fantasy genre once again. Having read the book and enjoyed it despite some obvious similarities to Star Wars, I walked into \\"Eragon\\" expecting a fun little fantasy romp. Man, leave it to Hollywood to destroy the things you love. Heck, leave it to Hollywood to destroy things you even enjoy on a very simplistic level.<br /><br />I never for a minute believed \\"Eragon\\" was the next classic in the making, just a fantasy book for kids that I happened to really enjoy. After watching the film I wondered whether or not I was crazy for even getting into the books in the first place. \\"Eragon\\" revolves around a young farmer named Eragon (but not Luke Skywalker), who lives with his Uncle and half brother (but no Aunt), and dreams of leaving the farm when he gets older (but not too much older). Then one day Eragon finds a dragon egg while hunting, and when it hatches into the worlds last dragon Eragon finds he is in possession of something that could change the fate of the world (but this item isn't an evil ring that makes people go all woo-ho). Shortly after Eragon names the dragon Saphira, an old man named Brom (but not Obi-Wan Kenobi) shows up to explain that Eragon is the last Dragon Rider in the world.<br /><br />Dragon Riders (which in no way should be confused with Jedi's) used to be the best magic warriors in the land, until the evil emperor Galbatorix (but not Darth Vader) destroyed them all. With Eragon though, the Dragon Riders have a chance to rise again, and destroy the empire. All Eragon has to do is follow Brom and join the rebel freedom fighters the Varden (but not the Rebel Alliance). Along the way Eragon and Brom meet up with Ayra the elf (but not Princess Leia), the evil killers known as Ra'zac (but not Black Riders), and a rouge named Murtagh (but not Aragon...oh, wait, Eragon's supposed to be Aragon. Darn, now I'm getting this crap confused). Throw in some okay special effects (AKA: Money!) and you have the \\"Eragon,\\" which was once a charming children's book that now looks all corporate due to big wigs interfering. \\"Eragon,\\" which was directed by a first time director, feels amateurish and cheap. The acting in this movie, save for Jeremy Irons as Brom, is simply awful.<br /><br />Edward Speleers, who was hand picked to play Eragon himself, is so bloody terrible I wanted to slap the kid. Why must this guy say something stupid at every. Single. Important scene? Do we need this character to say \\"The empire sounds really evil\\" and \\"We, shall, PREVAIL!!!\\" Oh, and while Eragon himself didn't say this, hands down the worst line is \\"Some friends can't be replaced...thankfully, some friends don't have to be.\\" I swear, I shot soda out of my nine inches from a gag reflex (and the fact that I wasn't even drinking soda made this situation even more unpleasant). The action sequences are okay, but not spectacular. One of the characters disappears in a haze of smoke, other characters run and scream while getting barbequed by the dragon, and the evil emperor constantly complains that his minions can't do anything right. This is why neo-terrorism was never a huge threat in the old days: No body has a clue on what makes a good killer.<br /><br />They run, they scream, they do everything but kill anyone (one characters death is an accident). All of this leads up to a shocking epic village battle, where the climax features Eragon flying on his dragon and sword fighting with a wizard who has conjured his own fake dragon out of black powder. That was a great scene, though it's frustrating because it hints that this movie could have been much better then it ended up being. It's not even the epic things that is a problem with this movie, it's the minor things. A suit of armor is made for Saphira, but the armor she ends up wearing is completely different. Ayra is an elf, but do to a lack of pointy ears you would have no clue of this unless someone told you. The ending is extremely abrupt, with a scene that has been in neither of the two books, which leads me to believe this twist was either a sneak preview to book three or a big guess on the film makers part.<br /><br />It's a common thing to see a movie where the film makers obviously had no faith in their source material, it's just strange to see them having no faith in a sure bet. They have the rights to film a trilogy for one of the most popular children's books in the last five years, I think they can breath a sigh of relief and not worry so much to the point where they feel they have to change everything. I also admit to being disappointing the CGI, as the dragon looks overly cartoony and almost never interacts with the live actors or the ho-hum sets. The final irony in all this was to watch the ending credits with a love ballad sung by Avril Lavigne, which I suppose is supposed to be the cherry on top of this Ice Cream Sunday. Like the rest of the movie it's extremely corny, and since there is no romance in the movie at all I wonder what it's doing here (Eragon and Arya's relationship won't develope until movie two). \\"Eragon\\" was a huge, huge misfire.

0060853980|5.0|When a book has been reviewed a few hundred times, as this one has, most of the salient points of interest have been covered.  However, I can't resist adding my own thoughts, as this has been the book I recommend most to friends and one that I have reread, with the greatest of pleasure, on an almost yearly basis since its publication. <br /> <br />I have never understood why Good Omens is marketed solely as slapstick, for behind the obvious hilarity lies a profound understanding of human nature and a thoughtful contemplation of issues \\"ineffable\\".  The first half of the book is the strongest and still rewards casual browsing: there is so much subtle wit packed into each page that I can usually find some droll reference that I had missed the first dozen times around.  Gluing together the marvelously funny set pieces (the opening baby switch; the naming of \\"Dog\\"; the restaurant scene where we meet the Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse) is a warm description of the personal relationship between the two emissaries of opposing forces who have grown from adversaries to respectful friends.  Despite the occasionally inappropriate sentence (some British humor that is definitely not considered acceptable these days) and the labored events of the ending pages, this is a WONDERFUL book. <br /> <br />That being said, I have had to be careful in whom I choose to give this (and I have given away many copies!) as not everyone has enjoyed it.   Humor can't be explained: either you find something funny, or you don't.  It will clearly appeal, as advertised, to fans of comic science fiction.  However, my wife loves this book as much as I do, and her great literary joy is to reread the entire works of Jane Austen each year.  You will know after reading a few pages of \\"Good Omens\\" whether or not it's for you. <br /> <br />If you have enjoyed this and would like to read something of a similar nature (funny, literate sci-fi with well-realized characters), I highly recommend \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" by Connie Willis.  This book will in turn lead you to its spaceship-free inspiration, Jerome K. Jerome's sublime \\"Three Men in a Boat\\", whose affectionate portrayal of three friends and a dog is still LOL fresh after 100 years in print.
B0002OERI0|5.0|After the mediocrity of the albums \\"Nimrod\\" (which did have several really good tracks) and \\"Warning\\" (which only had \\"Minority\\" and \\"Church On Sunday\\" to redeem it), Green Day has returned with a great cd. Don't be scared away by the two singles, \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" and \\"Wake Me When September Ends\\" - they are easily the two worst tracks on the album. OK to listen to once but they get very boring very quickly. Let's instead focus on the rest of \\"American Idiot\\", which starts off with a bang - a one-two punch of the punk rock of the title track and then the epic \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\", which is a punk mini-opera. Most of the rest of the album (\\"Holiday\\", \\"She's A Rebel\\", \\"Extraordinary Girl\\", etc) is solid, but the real gem is the slow build up of \\"Are We The Waiting\\" followed by the explosive and incredible \\"St. Jimmy\\", which is probably the best song Green Day has ever written. The combination of punk, power, and sheer sing-a-long make this track one not to be missed. Doubtful of how good it is? Just listen to the crowd reaction on the live \\"Bullet In A Bible\\" cd/dvd. <br /> <br />To summarize - yes there are a couple of mediocre (at best) tracks here but also \\"St. Jimmy\\" - which is worth the price of admission by itself. Overall \\"American Idiot\\" is Green Day's strongest album ever, which is saying something considering they also have the pop/punk classics \\"Dookie\\" and \\"Insomniac\\" in their catalogue. So if don't already have it - go get it now.
1400097029|2.0|I agree with other reviewers in that Banville used beautiful language when writing The Sea.  His descriptions of characters and setting were strong, however, the story did not keep me the least bit engaged.  I didn't feel as though I knew his characters, and didn't really care where his story would lead me.  This book was a completle bore until the end when a few surprises are revealed.  In my opinion, a story about his days growing up near the sea would have been much more interesting.

B000005S0V|4.0|With the music industry going on today, we see a lot of artists really sounding like they are all more manufactured based on the image, rather the the authentic feeling of the music itself. That is why so many acts from the 70's and 80's have all been considered as a total memory. That recently has been the case with Elton John as well. Although he has made some excellent records these past several years, many have disregarded his as a throwback to the past, in favor of wannabe manufactured acts like Usher, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson. Still, his music is much more solid today, than those acts who are popular, and this hits record does try to show it.<br /><br />The Very Best Of Elton John is a 1990 double album that tries to be definitive in showing Elton's best songs throughout the 80's and 70's. The collection does handle very well compared to other greatest hits records that were released recently. The songs here have been compiled well and include a lot of his best songs from Your Song to Sacrifice, and mostly everything in between. The album also includes other greats like Tiny Dancer, Blue Eyes, Kiss The Bride, Nikita, and Don't Go breakin' My Heart with Kiki Dee. Although the album does handle well, there are still a lot of good songs that were sadly overshadowed from Elton on this collection. The record overlooks great songs like Empty Garden, Little Jeannie, and Take Me To The Pilot to name a few, which leaves some die hard fans feeling that more could've been added.<br /><br />While some new fans might consider a better hits record from Elton John like the Greatest Hits 1970-2002 because it is a bit cheaper in price, this double record still is a better reflection of his music at the time it was released. If you are a die hard fan of Elton John, than this is still a decent greatest hits package. The Very Best Of Elton John is a great buy, and I suggest this one for any album collection.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: C 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: C 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B-ongs: B- <br /> <br />Price: C 1/2+ <br /> <br />Remastering: C 1/2+ <br /> <br />Overall: B-
B00005JLF5|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 880 minutes, it is 4 episodes (1 Disc) less than TNG, and at least 2 Discs less than TOS. However in total, for the definitive, Star Trek collection, we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case may be the best of the lot. The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside. The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors DVD-ROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 (collect all complete the computer model). The discs are held in an open (no cardboard covering) plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, Deep Space Nine (DS9), Season One, dispenses with the pains of the growing stages of a new television series, and even moves towards creating very different lead characters for any genre. Here in DS9, the home world of Bajora has been plundered dry by Cardassia, who developed the DS9 station. Recent agreements between Starfleet and the Cardassians coupled with Bajora's freedom fighters have called for DS9 to be made into a Starfleet/Bajoran cooperative outpost, the furthest Starfleet has in the quadrant, newly commanded by Benjamin Sisko. He is a single parent to Jake Sisko, his son (whose mother died in a Borg attack led by a captured Picard, something that creates intense divisions between Sisko and Picard). The mysterious Odo, who does not know what species he is, is the station's metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative who comes to life best in the crime episodes. Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor (quite humorous at times) and Chief O'Brien has been imported from TNG with the new post of chief engineer (the new Scotty!). Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar and up to all sorts of tricks much to Odo's distaste. Major Kira is Sisko's first in command, and a Bajoran who does not fully trust Starfleet yet. Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman (and a long term friend of Sisko) assigned by Starfleet as a tactical technical advisor. For all intents and purposes this is `Hotel' in space. This hotel in space theme means that crucially the famous `To boldly go where no one has gone before' introduction is missing, but the special effects bonanza that DS9 promises more than makes up for the omission. Since DS9 is stationary it needs something other than a single planet to beam down too and so the pilot episode has a secret surprise in store (note how something is missing from the pilot episode introduction and yet is in all the subsequent other ones). This surprise is what makes DS9 so cool. Since TNG introduced the use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!), six years later the art has created near photorealistic inspirational subspace sequences, planets and backdrops. The fact that the DS9 space station uses alien technology that is not Starfleet regulation is a major design change to Star Trek that is for the better. Advances in makeup effects means that season one of DS9 has maybe more creatures than TOS and TNG combined. It is thoroughly new material. Not only that, but the very fact that Starfleet has been relegated to a command post (note: not captain), with the next in command being a Bajoran, with a smatter of Starfleet officers between other life forms, means unlike TOS and TNG, the star systems' finest are not exactly the most powerful party. DS9 is as much about maintaining a cohesive space station, as it exploring uncharted waters. Season One of DS9 is mostly about religion, duty, murder, epidemics, cultures, Q, trills, entities, gambling, shape shifters, immortality, storytelling, sides, power of the imagination, Lwaxana Troi, mutany and assasination. If you are in for DS9 Season 1 then you should consider TNG Season 6 because there are some crossover episodes between the two and for those who want to watch star trek in chronological order this is a must. DS9 lives up to its special effects promise. In fact with Season 2 of DS9 comes the final Season 7 of TNG which finished in the wake of this. Let's face it, for those that have come this far, it might not be the best of the star trek series, because of its inherent half non-star fleet cast, but it is certainly one the best SF series of all time. It is only when you remove terms like Starfleet and star trek from the box and episodes that you realizes how innovative the idea of a space station drama is. And on that bases alone I know most of us will be moving onto TNG Season 7 and getting DS9 Season 2 also. See you there.y it needs something other than a single planet to beam down too and so the pilot episode has a secret surprise in store (note how something is missing from the pilot episode introduction and yet is in all the subsequent other ones). This surprise is what makes DS9 so cool. Since TNG introduced the use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!), six years later the art has created near photorealistic inspirational subspace sequences, planets and backdrops. The fact that the DS9 space station uses alien technology that is not Starfleet regulation is a major design change to Star Trek that is for the better. Advances in makeup effects means that season one of DS9 has maybe more creatures than TOS and TNG combined. It is thoroughly new material. Not only that, but the very fact that Starfleet has been relegated to a command post (note: not captain), with the next in command being a Bajoran, with a smatter of Starfleet officers between other life forms, means unlike TOS and TNG, the star systems' finest are not exactly the most powerful party. DS9 is as much about maintaining a cohesive space station, as it exploring uncharted waters. Season One of DS9 is mostly about religion, duty, murder, epidemics, cultures, Q, trills, entities, gambling, shape shifters, immortality, storytelling, sides, power of the imagination, Lwaxana Troi, mutany and assasination. If you are in for DS9 Season 1 then you should consider TNG Season 6 because there are some crossover episodes between the two and for those who want to watch star trek in chronological order this is a must. DS9 lives up to its special effects promise. In fact with Season 2 of DS9 comes the final Season 7 of TNG which finished in the wake of this. Let's face it, for those that have come this far, it might not be the best of the star trek series, because of its inherent half non-star fleet cast, but it is certainly one the best SF series of all time. It is only when you remove terms like Starfleet and star trek from the box and episodes that you realizes how innovative the idea of a space station drama is. And on that bases alone I know most of us will be moving onto TNG Season 7 and getting DS9 Season 2 also. See you there.
B000IJ79UW|4.0|If you already own the 2001 DVD Expanded version of Superman: The Movie, then hang onto it and save your money.  The upgrade to this four-disc collection simply isn't worth it in my opinion, unless you're a die-hard Superman fan.<br /><br />This is what the four-disc collection includes.  On Disc 1 is the theaterical version the movie with a feature-length commentary by the producers, Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spemgler.  Disc-2 has the expanded version (though techincally correct, I don't really consider an extra eight mintues to the film to be an expanded version) with a feature-length commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankievicz.  This is also on the 2001 DVD.  On Disc-3 are the three documentaries that can also be found on the 2001 DVD, each one running about thirty minutes in length--Taking Flight: The Development of Superman, Making Superman: Filming the Legend, and The Magic Behind the Cape.  There's also a look at some deleted and restored scenes.  Finally, on Disc-4 is a fifty-minute 1980 TV documentary on The Making of Superman: The Movie.  A lot of this is already included in the three documentaries on Disc-3.  There's also the fifty-minute 1951 movie, Superman and the Mole Men, starring George Reeves and Phyllis Coats, plus nine Superman cartoons from the 1940's.<br /><br />I hadn't seen Superman: The Movie since it originally came out in 1978, and I was surprised at how well it held up.  I watched the expanded edition, instead of the theatrical version.  I have to admit, however, that I enjoyed the first half of the film more than I did the second.  The first half was much more serious in tone, while the second half was striving to be campy and joke-filled.  There were also a couple of plots holes in the second half of the movie that the viewer just has to overlook.  An example is that if Superman can fly fast enough to turn the earth's orbit backwards in time, why couldn't he get to Lois Lane's sinking car fast enough to save her?  Anyway, because it had been so long since I'd seen the movie, I didn't really notice anything different with the expanded edition.  Nothing stood out for me, which is why I don't think eight minutes amounts to much, though it is better than the minute-and-a-half that Donner added to Lethal Weapon 3 for the Director's Cut.<br /><br />I did enjoy the documentaries on Disc-3.  It was fun seeing just how skinny Christopher Reeve was when he auditioned for the role.  Also, I didn't know that Richard Donner had been fired from Superman II, though he already had 50-to-70% of the movie in the can.  He was actually doing Part I and II at the same time.  It was interesting to hear how Warner Brothers didn't want anything to do with the movie at first, but then began to cought up money once they finally realized just how good the film was going to be.  And, before Richard Donner was brought in to direct the film, the producers had hired Guy Hamilton to do it.  Hamilton was the director of Goldfinger.  It was only because the shooting location of the film was eventually changed from Italy to England that Hamilton was dropped (he hadn't paid his taxes in England) and Donner was brought on board.  Hamilton had already been involved in a year of pre-production with the film, but Donner couldn't use any of it and had to start over from scratch.  Donner was under a tremendous amount of pressure by everyone (for example, the producers had Richard Lester ready to step in at any moment as the director), yet he managed to get the movie made.  It turned out to be one Warner Brother's biggest hits.  Donner's reward was to be fired from Superman II.  Hollywood!<br /><br />Disc-4 didn't do that much for me.  As I said, parts of the 1980 documentary had been included in the three 2001 documentaries on Disc-3.  I did watch the short movie, Superman and the Mole Men, which was pretty funny.  The Mole Men were played by little people with rubber bald caps on and a black jump suits.  I found myself laughing out loud when Lois Lane first sees them and freezes in absolute fear.  The expression on her face is priceless.  Then, a mother in the near-by town sees them and screams so loud that people several blocks away can hear her as if she's standing right next to them.  Man, that was one loud scream!  I will say that George Reeves was a much better actor than people gave him credit for.  I felt he was smart to play Clark Kent as a straight, hard-hitting reporter, rather than as a bumbling, navie innocent the way Christopher Reeve did.  As far as the cartoons go, I didn't watch any of them.  Wasn't interested.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, I'd pick up the 2001 DVD edition of the expanded film and save fifteen dollars.  Last, but not least, for any of you interested in Superman II, there are now two versions of it out, so be careful in buying.  One is the Richard Lester version, which I got by mistake, and the other is the complete Richard Donner edition.  I barely made it through the Richard Lester version.  Though Sarah Douglas is sexy in it as Ursa, the film just doesn't hold up for me and seems too silly.them and freezes in absolute fear.  The expression on her face is priceless.

0553278223|5.0|Although parts of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" are over 60 years old, segments that where once published in magazines before being included in this much important volume of Mars colonization work, it is still some of the freshest SF you can read and certainly this book is easily a contender for one of the all time SF greats. Bradbury deals with the topic of mankind leaving Earth behind in the pursuit of adventure and discovery on Mars which usually results in the destruction of themselves or the home world they have founded with very little compromise between because wherever mankind goes he can not escape the one thing he always brings with him - that is... HIMSELF. The is the core of what colonization SF should be about. TMC consists of 26 short stories, some interconnected, others not, producing poetry of modern literature coupled with stories that capture the feel of the early Twilight Zone episodes (something this book would have innovated). \\"Rocket Summer\\" is a short poetic story that lasts a single page, \\"Ylla\\" a strange story of a Martian couple who live very out of the ordinary lives and express extraterrestrial emotions foreign to our own. \\"The Earth Men\\" is a very interesting story where other worlds are believe in relativism where truth is purely subjective and but a creation of the power of the mind. It sets the tale up for how some humans from Earth make first contact and have trouble convincing the Martians that they are real. This is just a fraction of the genius at work. It is hard to imagine that a SF novella could be so crammed packed with such timeless imagery.<br /><br />(note: the story of the black evacuation is in this edition)
B0000029GA|5.0|Let me preface by saying that I was just browsing CD reviews and stumbled upon the below 2-star write-ups. Excuse me? That's like giving Michaelangelo a shrug for painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling or sucking your teeth at God for the creation of life.  If you don't want to listen to a classic piece that could potentially change your religious beliefs, then by all means keep your Chris Brown/Bow Wow single on repeat.  Illmatic is easily the best rap album ever, and I would not be against putting up as a top 5 of all-time recording, regardless of genre.  Of course, I stick to mainly hip-hop, so that's a bit out of my jurisdiction.
B00005M91K|5.0|Time your copy of Baraka so that the first shot (of the mountain) appears right as the opening guitar sound of The Smashing Pumpkins' \\"MACHINA: The Machines of God\\" plays as well. The effect is comparable to and arguably better than the Dark Side of the Rainbow.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Leonardo stars as (Billy Costigan), a police cadet drop-out who becomes an undercover agent for a little known unit of the Massachusettes police department. He is set in place to takedown Jack Nicholson (Frank Costello) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan) Frank Costello is a South Boston mob boss who adopts Colin Sullivan, who then becomes an undercover agent in the Police department. (Sounds complicated) but its not really.<br /><br />These three give good performances, but it's Mark Walhberg who is the wekest one in the cast. But they all give a seemingly good portrayal of South Boston underworld. This is a tense thriller which plays well off of the crossed loyalties, who is good and who is bad. In the end a not so suprising ending kind of ruined it, but it is still a good ride.
0618680004|5.0|This book was an exceptional read, and was both educational as well as very entertaining.  Although, after reading it, I still believe there is a GOD, I can't help but agree with many, if not most of Dawkins arguments.  More people have died in the name of GOD and religion, than in any other manner of fashion...I have no hard statistics for this last statement, but having a rather broad exposure to the history of mankind, I can't help but come to this belief.   <br />I would put this on a MUST READ list, particularly in this day and age of fundamentalism which pervades our world, especially in the enemy camp of terrorists, who arbitrarily and capriciously declare fatwas against whomever might not agree with them, and extend kafirs toward their own religous clerics and leaders, whenever they act in disagreement with the terrorists 'religious' views of murdering men, women and children in the name of ALLAH... <br />Atheism is sounding better each time I hear a religious argument.   <br />READ THIS BOOK.... <br />a GOD LOVER.....
B000B7BRMM|2.0|I love Diana Krall's voice, style, the music she chooses to record, and the polish of her music.  I have all her CDs and they're great.  So, when I got this CD at Christmas 2005 I was really disappointed.  Look, it's OK, I guess, but not up to her usual standards.  There's no enthusiasm here (except for the false enthusiasm of her fingernail-on-chalkboard tittering \\"I'm just crazy 'bout hooorses\\"). <br /> <br />Rather than write it off as just average I decided to give it a whirl again for Christmas '06, and had the same reaction.  Guys might like this CD for her recumbent \\"come hither and unwrap THIS present\\" look and posture on the CD packaging, but there's little to come hither for inside. <br /> <br />
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Richard Gere plays Mr. John Clark, a contracts lawyer who commutes to and from work on the \\"El\\" (elevated train) in Chicago. Daydreaming and thinking about the day's events, he looks out the window. as he passes a red brick building with huge letters on the side, \\"Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio\\". He views Paulina, played by Jennifer Lopez, a beautiful dance instructor who is wistfully gazing out the window. He is captivated. When he sees her dancing, he is enticed to take ballroom dance lessons to help him break out of his humdrum predicatble existence. He lives in the suburbs, has two teenaged children, a girl and boy and a lovely wife of 19 years named Bev (Susan Sarandon) who is a successful department director in a high-end clothing store. He keeps his passion for dancing to himself ... until he discovers a co-worker at his office also has this secret passion.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci plays a lawyer who is fascinated by sports, which he talks about at the office all the time but it is a ruse. His real passion is for dancing, which has been an interest since he was a teenager. Tucci is hilarious as he dons a wig over his otherwise bald head, during his macho dance routines. John Clark discovers his \\"secret\\" at a hot dance spot where his friend melts the dance floor and is the center of attention. Bev, John's wife, is getting suspicious why John keeps coming home late on Wednesday nights (dance lesson night). Her curiosity is further fueled by a coworker's concerns that her own husband is having an affair. One Wednesday night, Bev calls the office only to discover John had left for the day. She questions him about his activities and he explains he left the office but then had returned to finish his work (this explanation does not wash as he did not pick up the line when she called). Bev takes matters one step further and hires a private investigator to track her husband's moves, fearing an affair. Obviously, communication between them is at an all time low. They live parallel lives, sharing very little about their personal thoughts and feelings ...<br /><br />Matters heat up between Paulina the dance instructor and John Clark after Miss Mitzi enrolls John and several other new students in a ballroom dance contest. John receives some one on one dance lessons with Paulina. The ballroom dance contest became the climactic experience for all the dancers. Miss Mitzi's students shone. Then an unexpected event changed the good fortune of John and his partner Bobbie. Bev and her daughter had secretly attended the performance and witnessed the circumstances. In the end, ball room dancing became the stimulus which helped revive the marriage of John Clark and his wife Bev. Ballroom dancing helped the other novice dancers discover courage in themselves and provided a successful foundation on which to build further succcess in life. Paulina also developed renewed confidence to pursue her career goals despite a setback which had initially led her back to teach dance lessons at Miss Mitzi's ...<br /><br />Overall, the film was an overwhelming success in terms of how it tied together the disparate lives of some very different people who had only one thing in common, an interest in ball room dancing. The film is a huge success because of how it so beautifully conveys ball room dancing to be the stimulus which reawakens Mr. John Clark to come alive, break out of his mold, reconnect with himself, his wife and his life. It is done with creativity and complexity. The plot and story development was superbly done. The tensions which arise in his life and are resolved keep the attention of the viewer throughout the film. There are hilarious moments, too such as when John Clark discovers his coworker dancing like a macho super star with all the beautiful women ... such a contrast to his typical office persona. The fact that John Clark originally became interested in ball room dancing because of seeing Paulina, the beautiful dance instructor staring out the window ... provides more counterpoint of temptation, emphasizing the humdrum relationship with his wife. The film builds interest and fascination as the relationship between John Clark who is the student and Paulina, the exquisite dance instructor develops. The big question is ... will they or won't they connect into something more?<br /><br />Peter Chilsom the director did a phenomenal job of matching the right actors and actresses for the various roles. The DVD special features section was especially well done , the interview with the Director, and various actors and actresses provided wonderful insights into how the film was made and the challenges of learning ballroom dance. I deduct one star for only this reason, the film needed some long shots of scenes in Chicago. The scenes were confined to either views along the way as Mr. Clark rode the train, the inside of the dance studio, the inside of the Clark's home, Mr. Clark's office, some dark dreary street scenes, a restaurant, or the ballroom. The film begins with Mr. John Clark on the \\"El\\" and one sees very little of the city at any time during the film. Chicago has uniquely attractive buildings for which it is famous and a stunningly beautiful water front, honing in on some of these during the film, perhaps as it began or ended would have enhanced the film enormously.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|I fell asleep on this film a few years ago when I started it too late the night before it was due back at the video store.  It's not what I expected of a so-called \\"cult\\" film, or even a sci-fi or troubled-teenager genre flick.  Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.  The 26-year-old Kelly shoots movies like a pro if not an art movie director.  None of the \\"shock editing\\" that we've become so accustomed and desensitized to.  Instead, he favors long takes, slow pacing, and some of the most fluid camera movement in recent memory.  Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.<br /><br />All the same, I've just ordered the earlier, shorter version to see if some of the apparent flaws I noticed in the Director's Cut are lessened.  For one, some of the scenes are overly formulaic and obvious--both in the scripting and filming.  The hypocritical, self-righteous characters are played quite loudly, bordering on flat caricature.  Moreover, Kelly pulls gratuitous tricks like mocking them with \\"fast action\\" shooting (whereas the youthful romantic hero and heroine, of course, are shot in slow motion).  Drew Barrymore seems to occupy unnecessary screen time toward the end of the film, tilting this POV film to her situation rather than Darko's.  Also, all the time-travel nonsense, which I understand has been exaggerated in both this version and on a Johnny Darko website, could be reduced to the betterment of the film, imo.  Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time-wasters like Dazed and Confused (unless you're a teenager).<br /><br />Although Kelly talks about the film as Reagan-era social satire (an easy target, since the 80s were a rerun of the repressive 1950s), the movie is less about an historical period than about other movies: in fact, it's a collection of mirrors reflecting other movies.  Several shots of Darko recall Norman Bates, when we learn about his dual identity at the end of Psycho.  Darko's alter ego, Frank, recalls Jeffrey Beaumont's dark twin, Frank (Dennis Hopper), in Lynch's Blue Velvet.  The playing off of psychological vs. chronological time, challenging the viewer to decide which temporal dimension he is currently viewing, reprises Lynne's remarkable film, \\"Jacob's Ladder.\\"  And the time-travel theme owes less to \\"Back to the Future\\" than \\"serious\\" science fiction movies like \\"12 Monkeys\\" and the 30-minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: \\"La Jetee.\\"<br /><br />But most strikingly, the film echoes the central theme of Burgess/Kubrick's \\"Clockwork Orange,\\" where Alex and his Droogs talk Nadsat and commit rape and violence to assert their free choice and humanity in a world that threatens to \\"condition\\" them, transforming them into deterministic machines.  Two key moments in Darko: the intercut chapter with the quote, \\"The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from oblivion,\\" and Darko's conversation with his science teacher, who explains to him that if he were able to know his future, he would have a choice to accept or avoid it, which means that destiny would come to an end.<br /><br />This is a film that celebrates choice--not just its characters' but the viewers'.  Moviegoers need not subject themselves to mindless surrogate experiences in virtual reality, pretending that loneliness and fear are more imagined than real. The attentive viewer is likely to feel that the disturbed teen protagonist has made some significant choices which, however risky or even deadly, have prepared him to face the difficult circumstances of life that none of us can control.<br /><br />Finally, this is a director who definitely knows Catcher in the Rye, infusing his main character with so much of Holden's spirit (obsession with sex and death, impatience with phoniness and pretense, adoption of grandiose thinking and a savior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the \\"everychild\\" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit.avior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the \\"everychild\\" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I bought Closer because I had heard You Raise Me Up and I just fell in love with that song and wanted to dedicate it to my late mother. I knew that this album would be good but I didn't know it would be THAT good. I loved nearly every song on there. I don't know a lick of Italian, but I am willing to learn it. The song that was such a surprise, and a pleasant one, was #13, Never Let Go. It is not like the other songs on there because it's not as organic as the others but he did a great job.  I am addicted to My Confession because it is such a sexy song. Joshua Bell's violin on Mi Mancherai just really made that song even more powerful. I am not a fan of the French song but I will give him props on that. Josh Groban's voice has really deepened and become even better, more soulful from when I first heard him in \\"To Where You Are\\". That was a beautiful song and I loved when he sang it but his voice has really gotten better. He's really grown as a singer and an artist and that is the sign of true talent. I've heard some songs from Awake and I am getting that album.   If you're looking for great, richly sung music, I highly recommend this album.
B000002H92|5.0|This is a great live doors album.  The 1st disc is the best.  The highlight of the album is the live performance of Jim's poetry with Celebration of the Lizard.  The sound on this concert sounds like it was record very recently, not in the late 60's.  It's crisp clean and you feel like you right there at a Doors concert=something I wished I could have experienced.  Of course, it includes some of their best songs, break on through, light my fire, unknown soldier and the end.  I know there are some other pricey rececently released live doors out there, but this one is greatly priced and if you like morrison's poetry, this is worth it right here to hear it done live..
0743289412|5.0|I just finished reading Lisey's story last night and have to say I was pleased with this book from the beginning to the end.  I was a bit weary of buying Lisey's story in the first place because of many of the reviews stating that this was a love story or a romantic novel.  See I am a die hard Stephen King fan who enjoys horror and suspense novels and would be disappointed if this book turned out to be some sort of Fabio tale.  It didn't... Sure there was the strong love connection between Lisey and her late husband Scott but saying this is a love story is like saying the Shinning is a story about a family going on a vacation to watch over an abandoned hotel...Which it is, but there's a little more to the story than that. <br />    Lisey's Story is an intriguing tale that is filled with the elements of horror and the supernatural.  Some of Kings Ideas are a little \\"Out there\\" but that is why we love Stephen King.  He can spark our imagination and bring a chill to our spine.   If you are a King fan or not, I am sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did.    <br />
B000JJRIN4|5.0|i wrote a review about this around the time it came out... i did not like it at all... i thought she lost her imagination... after listenin it and watchin her in concert i completely changed my mind... this album is BRILLIANT!!!! not as great as her first but its pretty equal... she shines more on the slower tracks than the up beat ones.....    at first i said my favourite song on the album was \\"wind it up\\" because it was the only original song on the album...     this time my favourite song is '4 in the morning'... this song has bass i never thought a song would ever have... her voice is sooo enchanting. sometimes i forget she has such a great singing voice...     my other favourite track is 'u started it' with pharrell... this song is soooo emotional... pharrells voice is so powerful and heartfelt... although this song is about fighting... LOL...    'flouresent' 'yummy' 'early winter' 'wonderful life' and 'don't get it twisted' are my favourite tracks on the album... i dint like these songs at first but the life after is great... and the way she performed this songs at her concert helped alot as well....    People if you lost faith in gwen on this album please give her another shot.... it may seem wierd at first but listen to where she is coming from....    4.7stars out of 5: almost perfect...
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Over the years I have seen Broadway adapted to the big screen and the big screen adapted to Broadway but rarely have I seen one done so beautifully. Nothing was lost, in fact, I think there was more since you can do more in the movies than on stage. If people haven't seen the stage version or the movies, I highly recommend that you see either one but if you see Broadway then make sure you get the soundtrack for the marvelous music or just buy the dvd and you can watch over and over. This one is an A+
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Maybe this is a coincidence, maybe not, but I just noticed something: <br /> <br />Band of Horses <br />2006 Debut Album = Everything All the Time <br />First Song = \\"The First Song\\" <br /> <br />Built to Spill  <br />1993 Debut Album = Ultimate Alternative Waivers <br />First Song = \\"The First Song\\" <br /> <br />Regardless, with their release of \\"Everything All the Time\\" last year, Band of Horses has confidently displayed their potential to act as the forerunner of our beloved Indie Rock sound for the remainder of this decade, much as Built to Spill did in the 90's.   <br /> <br />If you like this record, then you need to hear the following albums: <br />Built to Spill - \\"Perfect from Now On\\" & \\"Keep it like a Secret\\" <br />Iron & Wine - \\"The Creek Drank the Cradle\\" & \\"Our Endless Numbered Days\\" <br /> <br />If you insist on doing your silly I-Pod thing, then simply download the songs \\"The Funeral\\" and \\"I Go to the Barn Cause I Like The\\", and listen for yourself.  If the transitions in these unforgettable songs do no leave you breathless, then there is something wrong with your ears, or maybe your ridiculous I-Pod.  <br /> <br />Clearly heavily influenced by both Built to Spill and Iron & Wine, Band of Horses have crafted an album combining both the finest characteristics of the brilliant electric guitar hook, the backbone of indie rock, with the stripped-down acoustic simplicity of a back country road that has never seen electricity.  Although Doug Martsch and Sam Beam should be flattered, they must also realize that Band of Horses are attempting to take music to a new level here.  No joke. <br /> <br />Other than the lead singers' voices, I do not hear much similarity in the sound of Band of Horses compared to My Morning Jacket.  Band of Horses has nailed an extremely complex sound that mesmerizes the listener as both an otherworldly, yet incredibly intimate experience.  My Morning Jacket's sound is much more traditional, alt-country, or even classic rock influenced (CCR, The Band), and in my opinion is OK, but a little boring.   <br /> <br />If there were anything negative I would have to say about this great debut record, it would be that it is too short.  It almost feels like an EP, which inevitably leaves you wanting to hear more.  This is good and bad.  Hopefully, the next Band of Horses record will more fully develop and expand on the initial ideas and expressions laid down on \\"Everything all the Time\\".  <br /> <br />And to the reviewer Atom Jack (10/10/06), it might interest you to know that Ben Bridwell is originally from South Carolina.  If fact, the band has recently moved back there to record their next album.  With this knowledge, one might say that the lyrics to the beautiful song \\"Part One\\" are quite meaningful, unlike your idiotic review of this fantastic album. <br />
B000IZJZLM|5.0|When I first heard that Simon Cowell was scouring the globe looking for members of a classical group, I was curious. Those in the US and UK know Simon as the scerbic judge on American Idol and in all honesty, I wasn't looking forward to what he might come up with.  <br />Then I heard about IL Divo and saw them perform on Oprah; my jaw dropped and I have been a devoted fan ever since. I just got Siempre and I heard that they were doing a rendition of Nights in White Satin. I like the original and it's not an easy song to remake.  I sat, I listened and I thought and I listened again. I couldn't believe it. They were wonderful. My only complaint with the song is that it was too short.  I wanted to hear them sing the whole thing (it's a reasonably long song) but that's how much I loved it. So I am an IL Divo fan through and through. Here's hoping their current tour comes to the US. I AM THERE!

B00003CXA6|5.0|This is an exceptional film. I did not move for the entire 4.5 hours of this great telling of the story of the battle of Gettysburg. The battle scenes were well developed so that the viewer could make sense of the charges, the wins, the loses. The film was able to capture General Lee's determination to engage the enemy even if under poor conditions. In the book, the Killer Angels, it is explained that Lee was a student of the warfare strategies of Napoleon Bonaparte and Bonaparte argued to always assume the offensive for the defensive position eventually results in loss.     The leadership of Lee is compared to the Leadership of Longstreet, Lee's second in command. Longstreet advised not to engage under the circumstances offered at Gettysburg. In hindsight, it was Longstreet who was correct and Lee who made a critical misjudgement that turned the tide of the war.    My only small concern was that historians have told us that Longstreet was a military genius but also a moody, somber man who continually grieved the loss of all 4 of his children who died on the same day from scarlet fever. Longstreet was not known to be an overfriendly man. Yet Tom Beringer plays Longstreet a bit more optimistic and upbeat than his reputation, his writings, and the observations of those around him would lead us to believe.    Overall,this is exceptional entertainment and a wonderful tool for teaching US history.
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|We just got back from the Sundance Film Festival where we were lucky enough to see Once and got a special treat of having Glen and Marketa play Falling Slowly live.  They are billiant - as is the movie.  I went in to the movie with no knowledge of The Frames or Glen and came out a huge fan.  Their songs are so deeply moving it is hard to describe.  Marketa is a wonderful addition and simply amazing in the movie, you will definitely fall in love with her. <br /> <br />Buy the album and see the movie.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|First of all, let me get on the record as never having heard of the Silent Hill videogame franchise before viewing this film.  I went into the film expecting a dark, but potentially formulaic and predictable horror film like many others that studios have released lately.  What I saw was captivating and utterly disturbing...and I mean that as a sincere compliment to the filmmakers. <br /> <br />The story line and exposition are a bit thin in spots, but once the viewer is immersed in the utterly nightmarish world of Silent Hill, the visual imagery is so compelling, the viewer is compelled to forgive these minor complaints.  I do not recall having seen a film before that so deeply resonated with my subconscious boogeymen.  Although the film certainly has its share of gory moments, the true horror is in the awful, hellish creatures that the protagonist experiences in the deserted town of Silent Hill.  From the misshapen, twisted humanoids to the miners to the ever-gruesome Red Pyramid, the creature work is fantastic. <br /> <br />Another component of the film that makes it so utterly disturbing is that there is actually a town in my home state of Pennsylvania that has been largely abandoned for the same reasons as the fictional Silent Hill.  Centralia, PA is also on fire from beneath, and only a handful of residents remain.  Like Silent Hill, Centralia has been essentially decommissioned as a town (the post office even took away its zip code), and the knowledge that such a place actually exists (and that a few residents still live there) lends an air of authenticity to the film that only makes it that much more disturbing. <br /> <br />This is not your average videogame-to-film adaptation (e.g., Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Doom) that relies more on the systematic execution of stylized violence between familiar characters than on any real filmmaking prowess.  Gans and his art directors create an alternate universe that is literally the stuff of nightmares.  Frightening, graphic, and disturbing material, but GREAT if you like to be scared senseless every once and awhile.
0307341542|4.0|I picked up a used copy of the advanced release of this book at a used bookstore, just on a lark. I read the first page only. I bought it, took it home and stayed up till 4:30am just to finish it.  <br /> <br />I love this writer.  <br />I wish she had more books I could run out and get right now. <br /> <br />Outstanding book. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's too soon to tell. But I think this book has a good chance of earning a place as a classic. And I know Ms. Flynn is going to be a force in the liteary world--mystery thrillers or otherwise.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|Since the first \\"Saw\\" came out, a highly low-budget film mostly panned by critics which has become surprisingly successful, the sequels have taken the idea and managed to make it if not any deeper or more complex plot-wise, they were certainly more enjoyable.  It's especially entertaining to see in Saw II as Donnie Wahlberg's character is driven nuts just talking to Jigsaw, who promises his son's \\"safe\\" delivery if he just stays and talks (note: safe not put in quotes because its untrue, it's just a spoiler)<br /><br />****SPOILERS ALERT****<br /><br />Saw III starts out with a much denied rumor proven true of Donnie Wahlberg returning as the cop from Saw II.  He is placed in the same bathroom as Adam and Lawrence were in the first, but rather than saw his foot off, he does somethng more gruesome (bashing his foot so it can slide through the cuff) and then goes after Amanda who is still in the catacombs.  He nearly succeeds in killing her, but she eventually prevails.<br /><br />Then we move on with the usual someone caught in Jigsaw's trap, and showing more people caught in his traps.  But there's something different about these ones... no one is surviving the traps, and while some of them are particularly impossible (try removing a metal ring that is connected to your jaw, beneath your tongue and behind your chin), even if the person somehow managed to survive it, their traps do not let them go.<br /><br />Before the main victims are introduced, the sole recurring character (save for Jigsaw and Amanda) from the franchise (played by Dina Meyer) discovers that Jigsaw's traps have become inescapable, and the slaughter is becoming more brutal without any particular justification.  As she makes this revelation, she is now caught in one of Jigsaw's traps, and would have escaped, but her contraption failed to open with the key she retrieved in a cup of acid, and she dies.<br /><br />Now we are introduced to the characters.  I have mixed feelings about them as I love Angus Macfeyden as an actor, and he certainly brings his character as much to life as he can, while the woman playing his wife (Lynn) seems quite bored in the beginning where she's shown going to work after having an affair.  Macfayden's character (Jeff) is perpetually tormented by the death of his son in a car accident, and the person involved has been let off and so his life falls apart as he devotes himself to tracking the people down and--probably--killing him.<br /><br />Quickly, the two are captured by Jigsaw's new assistant, Amanda, and placed in their respective traps.  Lynn, being the doctor, is fixed with a neck-contraption with shotgun shells which will ignite and kill her if a now-bedridden Jigsaw dies, and she is responsible for keeping him alive.<br /><br />Jeff, meanwhile, is placed in a gauntlet of a different kind of torture.  Rather than suffer physically, he is made to suffer mentally as Jigsaw's gauntlet leads him to rooms where other people are placed in brutal traps.  Each person has a tape with them, which is addressed to Jeff, and told how each person was partly responsible for either his son's death or the mistrial resulting in his killer's escape from justice.  Jigsaw's test is to see if he can forgive them for their actions or inactions and help them to escape the traps.<br /><br />The first is a woman who was jogging that morning that Jeff's son was hit, and refused to testify in court.  She is stripped naked and chained by her hands in the middle of a freezer, while a machine sprays her with misty water every few minutes, intending to freeze her.  Jeff is reluctant to free her at first, but soon overcomes this and attempts to retrieve the key to let her go (resulting in a nasty flesh wound on his cheek) but by the time he gets it, she is completely frozen over, and the lock as well.<br /><br />The next room he goes into he must free the judge who dismissed the case due to lack of evidence.  He is strapped by the neck at the bottom of a pit while a machine takes pig carcasses and drops them in a grinder, shooting the liquified pigs into the pit to slowly drown him.  Jeff must get the key to shut the machine off by burning his son's stuffed animals which Jeff kept to himself obsessively after his son's death.  He gets it in time to save the man, and they move on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, while Lynn is caring for Jigsaw, we get some insight not only into Jigsaw and his past, but also insight into Amanda, and how her apparent Stockholm Syndrome with Jigsaw evolved into a full-on obsession, so much so that she begins to grow insanely jealous with Lynn, whom Jigsaw is treating benevolently, while scolding Amanda for lashing out emotionally.  She relieves the pain by cutting her thighs.<br /><br />There are also some very nice and insightful flashbacks, showing that Amanda's assistance of Jigsaw has extended as far back as Dr Gordon and Adam in the first movie.  We see her preparing Jigsaw for his stint in the room, taking a drug to slow his breathing and heartbeat (so he can appear a corpse) while also placing Adam in the cold bath and setting up everything.  We even see her coming in after Jigsaw has left Adam in the bathroom, and see her reviving a still-alive Adam and then murdering him (by wrapping a plastic bag around his head), and the rush she gets from killing him.<br /><br />We also get to see flashbacks showing Amanda developing an almost daughterly obsession with Jigsaw, and her growing taste for murder.  We find out she is the one responsible for making Jigsaw's traps unwinnable, and Jigsaw is not oblivious to this.<br /><br />Back with Jeff and the judge, they come into the final room, where the man who killed Jeff's son is placed in a crucifix-style trap.  It slowly begins to twist his limbs one by one in 360 circles, and the key to unlock the man from the device is hanging inside a glass tube connected to the trigger of a shotgun.  Jeff is obviously hesitant, but with the pressure of the judge, he decides to help him, but is having trouble trying to get the key without setting off the shotgun.  We are led to believe that the shotgun is empty and that this is merely a test of Jeff's willingness to shed some of his own blood to save another.  Still, he yanks the key and jerks away, just as the shotgun fires off and accidentally hits the judge who is standing off behind him.  Jeff attempts to use the key to free the man in the trap, but the key does not fit (Amanda's doing) and he is killed with the crucifix twists his head completely around, and Jeff is left alone now.<br /><br />Jeff finds his way to Jigsaw's workshop somehow, and Amanda grows further infuriated with Lynn.  She then pulls out her gun and shoots Lynn, only to then be shot by Jeff who has found a gun nearby.  Jigsaw then reveals to Amanda that he has been testing her as well, and that she has failed.  Now that they are confronted, Jigsaw challenges Jeff with his last test---to forgive Jigsaw, for putting him and his wife in this situation.  Jeff says he forgives him---then retrieves a buzz saw and slits Jigsaw's throat.  As he starts to bleed to death, he unveils a tape recorder in his hand, and plays a pre-recorded message for Jeff in the event of Jigsaw's death.  He tells Jeff of what will happen, that he has failed, and that now he can never save his child---as Jeff had been told in Jigsaw's first tape that he would save his child, thinking it to be his son by getting justice for his death, when he never realized that Jigsaw had also kidnapped his daughter and placed her in a secret place.<br /><br />As Jigsaw flatlines, Lynn's neck contraption goes off and kills her, and Jeff is left to wail loudly in pain as his wife is dead, his daughter missing, and the exits to the hideout are closed shut by automatic metal doors, effectively trapping him inside.<br /><br />All in all, there was a lot more attempts at a philosophy in Jigsaw's torturous tests, and a lot of deeper insight into the mindsof Amanda and Jigsaw, as well as a strong theme of forgiveness.  Along with this, it is also much much gorier than the previous two, but nothing that is both gross and traumatic (like live amputations and such).  One of my favorite gory scenes was the emergency brain surgery performed by Lynn on Jigsaw using power tools and stolen medical equipment :P<br /><br />While not something deep and thrilling, it was an enjoyable ride, and I strongly oppose the studios' decision to call for a Saw IV.  It is over.  Jigsaw is dead, Amanda is dead, Kerry is dead, Detective Matthews is dead, Doctor Gordon is dead, Adam is dead, Lynn is dead, Jeff is dead, there's no one to go on other than lame copycats which we would rather not see.e decides to help him, but is having trouble trying to get the key without setting off the shotgun.

B000I5X81A|5.0|I was so happy to hear that these two icons of the musical world FINALLY collaborated - it was no let down, for sure!  While seemingly simple on some of the arrangements and lyrics, these two old guys still rock it out.  It's no \\"Cocaine\\" riddled CD, but wonderful in it's own right, imbued with the maturity, wisdom, and classic nature of these two great musicians.

The piano is in horrible need of tuning. the vocals aren't bad but sound a bit manufactured. i am forced by nature of my job to listen to new age music and must say that if i were to have to listen to this all day, I'd probably want to poke my eye out.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|I was some what surprised of how good this installment was.  It helps to bring a close to Saw 1 & Saw 2, showing what happened to the characters that were left to die.  In my opinion its the less gruesome then the previous two installments.  Theres more twist and the characters lives are in the hands of one person, who's one life hes trying to save.  The ending is different from the other two.
0385720920|5.0|There are a lot of great reasons to read this book, but I actually think it made me more creative.  Palahniuk has such a unique perspective on what may seem like mundane topics to your average person.  He turns a womens mental institution into a sick pornographic fantasy (I know I wouldn't have though of that), a colonial theme park into a pot-smoker's haven, and makes fine dining a profitable enterprise for those who forget to (or chose not to) chew their food.  Read this book, you'll enjoy it the whole way, and when you're done you'll have a new way of looking at hero's, work, sex, dying, psychology, and everything else Palahniuk covers in Choke.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|I was underwhelmed by the Ultimate Avengers DVD movies and had low expectations here... but I think this time some of the potential of the Marvel stable of characters has been realized.  This is not at the level of the Bruce Timm produced animations, but it's still a very nice script and the adaptations to the Iron Man mythos are not objectionable.  Without giving away any plot information, Iron Man's origin story is generally preserved but Rhodey and the Mandarin play central roles.  It was actually quite clever the way the Chinese setting is worked into the story since Stan Lee's original origin story would be politically incorrect and dated today.  The usually tedious process of presenting an origin story before you can start the movie story is completely eliminated here.  The \\"new\\" origin is actually an interesting story itself and drives the plot.  My take here is that the old comics fans will like this and new comics fans will like it too.  Pleasing both extremes is a tough task but I think they have accomplished it.  I hope the next movie has as tight and complete a script as this one.  I'd love to see a big-budget animated project, but with good writing, this level of production is just fine.  Good writing is the key to the success of these new Marvel projects.
B0000669JL|5.0|LEGEND is the splendid, aptly-named posthumous anthology of Bob Marley's most well-known works. The must-own reggae recording for those of us who know next to nothing about reggae, LEGEND showcases such songs as \\"Get Up Stand Up,\\" \\"Exodus,\\" and \\"Jammin',\\" among so many others. If you don't recognize the titles you WILL recognize the songs. If you recognize the songs, then get the message.<br /><br />The universatility of Marley's reggae is demonstrated by this simple vignette: Having loaded the CD into my convertible's disc player, I was stopped at a light near the local High School when I happened to look left and look right. The drivers of both cars were keeping time to \\"Buffalo Soldiers,\\" and a group of teenagers crossing the street started dancing in the crosswalk. This CD had united a score of utter strangers. If Marley is considered a Rastafari prophet, I can see why!
0618680004|5.0|People believe in god(s) because of the emotionally comforting fellowship attendant to religious observance.  The capacity of human minds to emote, to feel, to derive perceived benefits from religion is directly attributable to natural selection.  Dawkins book will be of great value to believers because it demonstrates how humans can discard false ideologies while actively engaging in human fellowship for the betterment of not only our species but all life as well.  Human dignity and spirit of mind are all we need to lift each other to new heights of civilization.  But continued indulgence in the mind viruses represented by religion can very easily lead to self-destruction.  Believers should try to step back from their faiths to take stock of where we are as a species and civilizaton. \\"The God Delusion\\" functions somewhat like a navigational instrument in that Dawkins points out how our species could evolve along lines ensuring greater good.  That which is false, theism, can never transform human society and culture in ways to achieve overall beneficial outcomes. This is because faith does not make truth. If it did, then all religions would be truth. Reality dictates that one cannot know anything by faith, for faith is belief without evidence or belief in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Only rational reasoning can lead to knoweldge. Expanding one's mind is necessary for continued growth. Be open-minded and give this book a chance to present its case.  After all, if Dawkins fails, the believer will have lost nothing and will come away with a better understanding of how non-believers, at least in part, see religion.
6305537321|5.0|I've always wanted to watch this movie and I am so glad that I watched it finally. Truly it is very classic and very timeless.    I am not going to repeat the story and praise the cast for their brilliant acting since so many of the reviewers here have already done these. But one thing I really find interesting and want to talk about is the similarity and difference between this movie and Sex and the City.    I was a fan of Sex and the City for a long time, ..... until I watched this movie. I have to admit that if I had watched it earlier, I probably would never have spent so much time watching Sex and the City.  There are actually many scences in S&C resemble those in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Both story happened in NYC. East Manhattern, whistling for a cab, charming uptown streets and buildings, lonely and smoking girls, wild parties, chasing after rich men, dreaming for a final settlement. I have no doubt that the director or producers of S&C have gotten their inspirations from Breakfast at Tiffany's. And Carol( Sarah Parker) has indubitably tried to imitate the classic and iconic image Holly (Audrey Hepburn)has created. Despite that both heroines's similar life style, Holly is the one that wins my heart and makes everyone  to love her, both in the movie and among the audience. Do I like Carol? Not that much. There is somewhere deep in my heart that's been touched by the childish naivty of Holly and her blatant statement of her being the wild thing and the courage with which she faced her bumpy life. Compared to her, Carol looks superficial, not as brave or even as wild, and shows a pseudo-sophistication. Of course, there are other parts of Carol that show her charm. But in my opinion, Carol is not as iconic and as charming as Holly,  as the latter truly established her as the brave-dreaming,couragous-acting NYC girl who somewhat still kept her inside purity and childish artlessness. These are all shown without reservation when Holly and Paul stole the animal masks from the store, Holly's love for the cat, and Holly's song playing of the \\"Moonriver\\". I guess that's why even in S&C, when Big is leaving Carol, he played the exact same classic song, The Moonriver. But the sadness aroused by this song in S&C is nowhere compared to the delicate and beautiful melancholy created in Breakfast at Tiffany's.

I have read all of Redford's books in addition to Wayne Dyer's and it difinitely delivers information useful to the observer for everyday living.  The movie utilizes well known actors, beautiful scenery, and thought provoking ideas.  It expresses the information both in a fashion which a young adult can grasp as well as the seasoned thinker.  It is a great tool for employee/customer relationship techniques as well.  Watch it and see your outlook on people and life shift to a higher energy level.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|In Josh Whedon has to be rated as one of the most imaginative, cleverest, and talented of \\"auteurs\\" -- those who are able to conceptualize a production, attract talented people in every phase of the work, and create work that will hook the audience and make other types of similar programs pale by comparison.  FIrefly is witty, clever, imaginative, with a memorable cast of characters, each of whom has a chance to display their own peculiar qualities of humanity.  Great chemistry between the characters.  Unfortunately, Fox curtailed the series after 16 episodes.  The movie follow-on, Serenity, allowed Whedon to bring closure to the plot in some ways, but left a feeling of regret for what might have been done if the series had been able to continue.

1593080719|5.0|It's obvious Thackeray is the king of satire. What's not so obvious is that he was ahead of his time in his writing style. His voice could be that of a star blogger on the Internet. The sardonic wit, the cynicism. Have things changed so little?<br /><br />His characters are not so much flawed as they are downright hateful. Even Dobbin, the saint and only true innocent in the book, is annoying in his loyalty to the bloodless Amelia. Still you're happy when he wins her in the end. As for Becky Sharp, you can't help but root for  her early on. Towards the middle of the book, however, you begin to hate her. Thackeray is brilliant. You can forgive a woman anything except not loving  her child. Once Becky rejects her son, she is no longer endearing. You can't care anymore. And he doesn't focus on her so much anymore, as if that was the end of the one character you had the most feelings for.<br /><br />But using the technique of day-time soap opera with its thousand and one sub-plots, Thackeray urges you to read on regardless of the fact that you don't like any of the characters. You  wonder where its going to end. Is anyone ever going to be happy? Is anyone ever going to get punished? Some of the characters do get punished of course, but some of them don't, or they don't know they're being punished. What good is it if they don't know it?<br /><br />It's hard to accept a story where a lot of the bad guys don't get punished. And yet, in the end, you can't help but being satisfied. I have no idea why. Is it because Dobbin finally does get Amelia? That Becky does seem to get what she deserves? And what does Becky deserve? Less than Amelia? Is Amelia happy in the end?Happier than Becky? Probably not. And that alone would probably make Becky happy if she thought about something besides herself for once. All I know is that as long as those two are miserable, I'm happy.<br /><br />Sue Lange<br />author, Tritcheon Hash, [...]
B000J103PC|4.0|My daugher wanted this for Christmas, so I got it for her and watched it with her.  Since I've always thought the \\"buzz\\" about Meryl Streep was mostly too much overhype, I didn't expect a lot - even though the reviews were good. I will admit though, the Streep did play this character just right.  We get to see her \\"human\\" side even though she remainds somewhat cold and alufe throughout the picture, and the film offers an interesting glimpse into the big business world of fashion. The DVD also features lots of deleted scenes and several good doumentaties.

B000002MU3|5.0|This record is what sets REM apart from all the other American guitar based alternative rock bands.  It is a significant departure from Out of Time and Automatic for the People, two very successful and outstanding records, that were folksy and rustic, with undistorted instruments and brilliant arrangements and sound.  It is also a significant departure from the REM sound of the 1980's, from the atmospheric, hypnotic, frenetic, jangly guitar and bass lines, and the light, hesitant mumbles of Michael Stipe and the harmony of Mike Mills of the Chronictown-Murmur-Reckoning era, to the arena rock stylings of Document and Green. <br /> <br />This record is all about rocking out with driving beats and catchy hooks.  The jangle is mostly gone as Peter Buck goes for heavy distortion, full major key power chords, wah wah/fuzz box effects. What isn't missing is the great songwriting, the unique contributions of each of the musicians that make REM what it is, and the confident and clever Michael Stipe, who doesn't have to scream to lead a band through a rock record. <br /> <br />The standout songs to me are:   <br /> <br />What's the Frequency Kenneth,  <br />Crush with Eyeliner,  <br />King of Comedy,(my favorite on the CD.  I know the REM fans tend to dismiss this one, but it is brilliant glam rock with nice backing vocals, a catchy beat and even catchier guitar.  It is great pop music),  <br />Bang and Blame,  <br />I Don't Sleep I Dream,  <br />Circus Envy. <br /> <br />But there isn't a bad song on this CD, so it is well worth the money. Get Monster.

I got to see them live with the Scorpions in Madrid, Spain and they put on a great show.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are pretty good too, but sometimes Udo's voice gets a little much with his screaming. However, that is a minor thing and not even worth knocking this review down a star.<br /><br />This is great stuff and I highly recommend it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What else can be said about this album? Honestly. Its been out 10 years almost now and its widely regarded as one of the greatest albums ever made, any genre. Yet, I'm sure there are some out there that still have not heard this album. I was like that for a long time, I never got Radiohead. I'd hear them on the radio and say, \\"Oh thats a good song.\\" But thats about it. I didn't understand why Radiohead fans seemed to think they were gods walking amongst men in the music industry. But, I had an open mind so on a whim one day, I decided to buy \\"Ok Computer.\\" It took me quite awhile to really grasp the importance and significance of this album. It's a very complex, yet highly intellegent masterpiece.<br /><br />I think alot of the greatest music does take awhile to get into. Thats the case with \\"Ok Computer\\". It's not something you will appreciate after one or two listens. Multiple listens are mandatory. In fact, this is one of those few albums I'd recommend someone to do that with. Music is subjective, obviously. But this album is so good, I think just about everyone should at least give it a chance and see if it's something they can get into. This is one of those rare occasions where the hype is true and the actual product is better than advertised. If you try only one Radiohead album, go buy \\"OK Computer\\". It should be in everyone's collection.

B00005JKJA|1.0|The movie is great and as everyone here agrees - great and David Lynch fun but this disc is a shabby version. On some laptops, the only portion that plays is a short macrovision movie - yea, thanks. I finally discovered that VLC will play this disc correctly so NOTE, it may or may not play on your DVD machine correctly even though it claims to be a DVD. <br /> <br />Also note, Universal was too cheap to make chapter marks - there are movies on DVD from the 1920's with chapter marks - none here so if you miss the days of rewinding and fast forwarding like VHS - here ya go ... the resolution is also just a B - probably has something to do with the macrovision interfering with the picture quality. <br /> <br />So, great movie but SKIP this disc - wait for a better version if you can.
B000002U8G|5.0|I am surprised that I'm actually reviewing this album as I absolutely despise the Dark Side Of The Moon era Floyd and later. Much of that is because of the classic rock radio stations that play them to death.<br /><br />To me this is the last great record they did before they sucked. The album starts with One Of These Days and is a trippy buzz-saw excursion. The other great cut is Fearless. The other songs are good too, and the thing ends with the full-side Echoes. This is the culmination of what came before and shows them at their peak.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album. It is one of their best.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I honestly didn't want to like this album. Saw them live and got turned off. I did however like Attack and that kept me interested. Despite me not wanting to like this album I kept coming back for more. I finally bought the album which suprised me, and even after owning it for some time I still keep listening to it regularly. For lack of a better term, it got under my skin. Some of the songs are incredibly addicting and you just keep coming back and back to hear them again. It's strange how I actually didn't want to like it, but after awhile it really just clicked with me. So don't let any pre-concieved notions keep you away from listening and enjoying this album. It is QUITE GOOD. It has an incredible atmosphere to it. I think someone else mentioned \\"spacey\\", and I think thats a good term for it. Very spacey atmosphere when you listen to it. \\"Was it a dream?\\" is a good example of this. Anyways, give this album a shot, it really surprised me and become one of my most listened too albums of 2006. I can't wait to see what they come out with next.
B00005JPEG|3.0|In an effort to give their younger brother, Norman (Ewan McGregor) a project to keep him busy now that he has joined the family publishing house, the older Warne brothers agree to publish Miss Beatrix Potter's (Renee Zellweger) first children's book. They don't expect the book about a young rabbit who wears a blue coat and gets into mischief to sell well, but they need to keep Norman busy. Beatrix is beside herself; as a single woman in Edwardian London, still living with her parents in her early 30s, she suspects this endeavor may provide her with a small measure of freedom, personal, financial, any type of freedom. But she also has very specific ideas about how the book should be published. As they work together, Norman surprises her with his ideas for the book and they become close. After the book is published, Beatrix is surprised to learn there will be a second book; \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" is selling well. No problem, because she has many stories. One day at lunch, she meets the rest of Norman's family, including his sister, Millie (Emily Watson) and the two women become fast friends. Norman proposes, but Beatrix's parents object to the marriage proposal. After much argument, they agree to let Beatrix marry Norman provided they wait until the end of the summer; the Potters spend every summer at their country home. As Beatrix leaves for the country side, Norman rushes to the train station to say goodbye. Beatrix kisses her soaked fianc&eacute;e; he forgot his umbrella and a rainstorm has drenched his clothing. He'll catch his... They are only too happy to wait. After all, what can happen in one summer?<br /><br />\\"Miss Potter\\" is a perfectly pleasant diversion for a few hours. Not a ground breaking film, it tells the story of one of the best selling children's authors of all time and hints a bit at her inspiration and life. But it merely hints. This is a film for Anglophiles who will love the scenery, the depiction of Edwardian London, the accents, the tea.<br /><br />But it also represents another entry in a current trend of British Cinema. Basically, this film is the British equivalent of an American studio release; plot points here, here and here, pleasant, solid if uninspired performances, light historical biography. It simply doesn't push the envelope like the great British, independent and foreign films we are used to and because of this, is a safer bet at the box office. I have nothing against a film biography, but give us a hint why the person is unusual, film worthy. The film's one concession to this is to show Beatrix's drawings come to life; they are her friends, providing companionship well into adult hood.<br /><br />I'm not sure the film can even be considered a British production. Produced by and starring Renee Zellweger and co-produced by Phoenix Productions and the Weinstein Company, a lot of American money went into this film. They clearly saw a market and a way to tap into this audience. But because the remainder of the cast is British, the film is set in England, it is directed by an Aussie and partially funded by a British television channel, I guess it qualifies. It just seems calling \\"Potter\\" a `British' film is a calculated attempt to get the film more Oscar attention then it deserves. You know, much like Will Smith starring in \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a calculated attempt to get an Oscar nomination for the popular movie star. Oh, wait....<br /><br />I really wish Zellweger would give up her efforts to convince everyone of what a serious actress she is and return to making the romantic comedies she used to make. You know the ones without the British accent? Okay, \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was cute, but Renee, you're no Meryl Streep. You're an AMERICAN, play some Americans. Stay away from the faux British accent for a while. Remind us why we came to love (or at least like) you in the first place.<br /><br />As Beatrix Potter, Zellweger is good. She convincingly portrays the writer's love of animals, her drawings, her books. When the animals come to life, her eyes light up and she clearly enjoys their companionship. But when she is interacting with humans, she seems to have two facial expressions. One of these, her face scrunched up and her mouth forming a half smile seems to be meant to convey both happiness and sadness. Frankly, she looks like she is suffering from hemorrhoids. The other facial expression is a blank look, which isn't used that often. I'm sure the point is to show how awkward she is with humans, but it doesn't work. Once she forms a relationship with Norman and Millie, his sister, she shouldn't appear awkward towards them, but she does. A third facial expression would have helped.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor's Norman is cute, charming and very gung ho. As the male equivalent of Beatrix, a bit awkward, a bit shy, a bit restrained, they seem a good fit. He also seems to be a more complex character despite his smaller amount of screen time. Norman clearly feels a bit intimidated in the company business and is very satisfied when he succeeds, proving he can contribute to the family business. It is also interesting to watch McGregor portray Norman wrestling with the rules of the era.<br /><br />Emily Watson plays Millie. A forward woman who, like Beatrix, is single and in her early 30s, she quickly announces \\"I have decided we are to be great friends\\" after she meets Beatrix. Her premonition proves accurate, becoming a friend, and confidant to the author, providing advice to her new best friend. I get the sense Millie was more than just a single woman in her early 30s and may have been slightly attracted to Beatrix. But this isn't explored, probably deemed too controversial for a film about a woman who believes her drawings of animals come to life. Nonetheless, she provides an ear for Beatrix and later a shoulder to cry on. And remains very single.<br /><br />The film is best when depicting the Edwardian society Beatrix inhabits. Even though she is a grown woman, because she is single she must be accompanied everywhere by an escort, an older woman in her mid 60s, who wears nothing but black. When she returns from a visit to the printers, her mother can barely believe it when a smudge of ink is discovered on a blouse, so beneath her daughter. Beatrix manages to invite Norman and Millie to the family's Christmas party and they blend in well with all of the society folks her mother is so desperate to impress. Throughout the evening, Beatrix and Norman play a sly game of cat and mouse trying to earn a few moments of time alone.<br /><br />\\"Miss Potter\\" is a good, if unremarkable portrait of a woman with some unique talent. Now if only the filmmakers had some unique talent to use on this project, we might have a more memorable film on our hands.animals, her drawings, her books.

B000GRUS22|5.0|I am never disappointed with Enigma. The group exceeded my expectations once again.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|How did this happen? Let's face it... Sir George lost a a couple of steps many years ago after producing the most cutting edge albums of the sixties. Always a full step ahead of everybody else back then. The one the others all tried to mimic as The Beatles released album after album full of new ideas. The proof that Martin was done as a producer was evident in 1994 when the remaining three Beatles took the poorly recorded mono unfinished Lennon tapes... \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Free As A Bird\\" (entrusted to them from Yoko) and handed them over to Jeff Lynne. I mean come on? When you hand something that precious and rare over to a member of ELO in lieu of George Martin... you know something's up. I mean they owed it to George just as a courtesy thing. Imagine knowing they'd eventually have to face him later at some point... and they still do it? That's cold. But they must have known something we didn't... like the job was too much for George perhaps? So ELO gets it... and admittingly both songs turn out okay.<br /><br />Now we move ahead twelve years... and George is... well twelve more years out of touch and an elderly man. And somehow he gets access to the Beatle catalog to play with like a child? He removes instruments from songs. Arbitrarily (it seems) inserts pieces of songs over other songs that are in different keys. He virtually ruins every single song on there. Sheesh! They were perfect the way they were. These versions have nothing but annoyances added to them. \\"Love\\" is simply a case of tossing a senile old ex studio genius a bone because they couldn't say no to him. Anybody other than Sir George and this pice of crap never see's the light of day. Let's pray they don't let him play some more with his son and come out with \\"More Love\\" or \\"Love Too\\". More of this would be way too much to endure.
1569242739|5.0|i love cookbooks, but i honestly make very few recipes, because most involve some odd ingredient that i just don't have or remember to buy, or some annoyance that makes them not as easy as i'd like when i have very little time. i heard about this book through some off-topic comment to an unrelated entry on a journal site, and i had to check it out-- the pictures made my mouth water for days until i could get the time to make a batch! i do have experience baking (mostly my own recipes and concoctions), but mostly vegetarian stuff-- i hadn't quite mastered vegan cooking, but i'd like to say that my VERY FIRST BATCH of the classic golden cupcakes (with the vegan buttercream frosting) i just made tonight came out WONDERFULLY. they're delicious! and really, it was very easy to make both the cake and the frosting, and it makes me so happy that i did it all without animal products. i'm so glad to have found this cookbook! <br /> <br />viva la cupcake!
B000ICLHIE|4.0|Much like David Lynch and Peter Greenaway (who?) did in wisely releasing their early films so they could make some extra cash from the extra sales AND satisfy the die-hard fans who were funding bootleggers who provided them with progressively shoddier copies of those said films - Tom Waits, following in tow with Jethro Tull and others,  is giving his fans a big present here with this wealth of \\"odds and ends\\" pieces not available on any of his regular releases.  But instead of offering them \\"warts and all\\" he seems to have specially recorded all or at least many of them for this release.  So in a sense, the original recordings of many of these are still floating out there and of value in the Black Market (I could be wrong).  But either way, as it is invariably frustrating, tedious, expensive, disappointing (the quality) and, dare I say, illegal for all the usual file-sharers and bootleggers out there to collect everything done by \\"the master\\" (as some would put it), this 3-CD set is a blessing.      I won't delve into the organization of the CD, or even an aesthetic criticism, as you've read it all before in other reviews and probably don't care to hear another opinion since you most likely have already decided to buy this.  So other than my slight disappointment in (what might be just my suspicion) that these are mostly new and not original recordings of previously unavailable tracks, my only other beef (preventing 5 stars) is that he should've gone WHOLE HOG and released whatever else he his hiding in his vaults.  I don't know what I don't know I haven't heard from him, but there are a few I can think of off the top of my head (the covers Sea of Love, Hokey Pokey, Papas Got a Brand New Bag, the originals Bronx Lulabye, and his collaboration on Jesus' Blood Hasn't Failed me Yet) that are missing, and given the \\"stories\\" on the last CD (which are great, including 2 \\"bonus tracks\\"), they could have made room for a few other songs.  Perhaps there were copyright problems with both his older material recorded while signed to previous labels (like Island) and with songs written by others.  I already have Vols. 1 & 2 of The Early Years, and so there is a gaping gap of extras, it seems to me, spanning the mid-70's to the late 80's which have been ignored.      As a sometimes seller on ebay, I won't ever be selling this gem - its a keeper!
B0001XAPX8|4.0|The Human Stain (Robert Benton, 2003)<br /><br />Robert Benton does not often direct movies, but when he does, you can be pretty much guaranteed a knockout: Kramer vs. Kramer, Places in the Heart, Nobody's Fool. After five years of silence (the longest in his career since the gap between his first and second films), Benton emerged in 2003 with The Human Stain, based on Philip Roth's rather obscure (for Roth, anyway) novel, and comes up with an interesting, complex, well-acted little film that far too few people saw.<br /><br />Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a professor at a small New England university. As the movie opens, he is accused of racism and his tenure is revoked, leading to the death of his wife, Iris (Phyllis Newman, of the fine, cancelled-far-too-early show 100 Centre St.), from a heart attack. His resulting rage at this pair of injustices leads him to the friendship of a local writer, Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), and romance with a young woman who works as a janitor at the school, Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman). Faunia's ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris) is not too thrilled about the latter. Underlying it all is a secret Silk has been keeping for half a century that might destroy him... or save him.<br /><br />Screenplay writer Nicholas Meyer sure has come a long way since Invasion of the Bee Girls. Here he takes a Philip Roth novel and does it justice, though to be fair it's kind of hard to buy Anthony Hopkins, of all people, in this role. If you can swallow your disbelief once the secret is revealed (and while that does happen relatively early on, it's still a spoiler), you're golden. Kidman plays her role to the hilt, taking on, in essence, the role Susan Sarandon popularized in the similarly-neglected 1990 film White Palace. Roth swung the age difference, but the rest of the trappings of the romantic tale are in place, and work just as well here as they did there. Zuckerman, Roth's detached and somewhat bemused Everyman character, sits on the sidelines and observes everything. I can't imagine what temptation there must be for anyone adapting a Zuckerman novel to bring Nathan himself to the forefront, but it's got to be monstrous (Nathan Zuckerman, after all, is the enduring character of Roth's novels, while everyone around him just passes through). Meyer resists, though, and Gary Sinise acts the part wonderfully. In the one scene where Zuckerman's presence indirectly affects the plot, Sinise just sits there looking half-embarrassed to be an agent of change. It's great stuff. Hopkins, on the other hand, is huge and bombastic and chews as much scenery as did Edward G. Robinson in his prime, and it fits. A fine film. If you missed it in its theatrical release, and you probably did, check it out on DVD. *** ½sidelines and observes everything.

B000M5AJQS|2.0|Based upon the Hong Kong film, MoGanDou/WuJianDao/Infernal Affairs, I have to say that if you've seen the HK version, this version is not as good.  No where near as good.  A lot of scenes got skipped over or fastforwarded through and as such the build up wasn't as good.  The ended was padded to become softer too and as such made the movie end on a much, tackier note.  Not worth it.  Infernal Affairs was much better.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Brick (Rian Johnson, 2005)<br /><br />Brick was listed at moviefone as one of the fifty best movies of 2006-- in fact, it sits on that list at number ten. Interestingly, just about every other review of the movie I've read was more hesitant in its praise, as if no one could believe that young filmmaker Rian Johnson and Third Rock from the Sun cutie Joseph Gordon-Levitt could take this admittedly ludicrous idea-- set a noir film straight out of the forties, archaic dialogue and all, in a modern suburban high school-- and pull it off. The evidence, however, can now be seen on DVD, and Johnson pulls it off tremendously.<br /><br />Gordon-Levitt's last two roles have been the kinds of things that kill careers in Hollywood on a regular basis-- first as a gay hustler in Gregg Araki's strong adaptation of Scott Heim's Mysterious Skin, and now as a guy who does the shuffle-and-mumble better than anyone since Crispin Glover in Wild at Heart. Gordon-Levitt here plays Brendan, a kid who, in the opening scene, is crouched in a culvert, staring at a body who may or may not be dead. We quickly learn that said body is that of his girlfriend (or ex-girlfriend, neither he nor we are ever truly sure) Emily (Emilie de Ravin of Lost); that she is, in fact, quite dead; and that Brendan is determined to find out why for the thoroughly archaic (but oh so noir) reason that, well, she asked him to help her out of a jam. Her new status as a member of the recently-living isn't going to stop him from doing his thing. This leads him to run-ins with psychotic hash addict Dode (Adam and Steve's Noah Segan) and local druglord The Pin (Lukas Haas, recently of the underrated Long Time Dead), the character around whom most of the film's criticism actually seems to center. And rightly, to an extent, for The Pin is a character you're not likely to forget. He's the quirkiest of a quirky bunch, a drug kingpin (hence the nickname) who lives and works in his mother's basement, has a right-hand man who puts one in mind of Marky Mark during his rapping days (The Laramie Project's Noah Fleiss)-- and his presence in the movie, with his style of dress, seems to date the film, which puts the lie to a number of criticisms about realism-- supplant this high school and this plot to the eighties/early nineties, and a lot of seeming anachronisms go away), and has so many affectations that he almost screams \\"I'm a parody!\\" And yet, somehow, Haas carries the role with an amazing amount of menace. If you can get through the first confrontation between Brendan and The Pin without thinking how unforgivably silly the whole thing is, then you've been well and truly roped in by this movie. Go along for the ride, 'cause it's a good one. ****puts one in mind of Marky Mark during his rapping days (The Laramie Project's Noah Fleiss)-- and his presence in the movie, with his style of dress, seems to date the film, which puts the lie to a number of criticisms about realism-- supplant this high school and this plot to the eighties/early nineties, and a lot of seeming anachronisms go away), and has so many affectations that he almost screams \\"I'm a parody!\\" And yet, somehow, Haas carries the role with an amazing amount of menace.

B00004R99F|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theater when I was a little girl. This movie was GREAT! Before this, Disney movie were generally for little kids and that was it. This was the first that appealed to adults. This was almost like a Jr/high school cartoon. There were a lot of sterotype high school kids in the movie. The soundtract was also great. I had a lot of catchy tunes.
B000002L68|5.0|Before i heard this album i was already a huge Prince fan. This took it to another level. This is a brilliant mixture of dance, music, sex and a splash of romance. When dove's cry hit the dance floor in typical Prince fashion with a hard rock guitar mixed with my favorite key board solo ever. It's very interesting to note how this song hit it big with it's strong biblical convictions (as are a lot of Prince's songs). This album is Prince's ultimate effort. He went pop with I would die for you and baby i'm a star. A lil' diddy called \\"darling Nikki\\" caused Tipper Gore to start her crusade against explicit lyrics. Tipper actually walked in on her daughter listening to it and heard \\"I met her in a hotel lobby masterbating in a magazine\\"... Purple Rain is a groundbreaking tribute to GOD that will never stop getting play in the clubs, parties, or in my ride! Purple Rain is my favorite song of all time. This is one those of those albums that you may have to eventually buy twice as it will capture you and not let go. I did! One of my personal fav's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" is easily one of Prince's more underappreciated ballads of them all. This song tugs at the heart and begs the Question \\"Do U want him ...or do u want me....cause i want u!!!\\"...The Rude Boy was at his crooning best there. This was Prince's time and he knew it! He was curing the foundation for what has now become one of the most successful individulist that music has ever spawned! He has garnered both respect and admiration for doing it his way and showing the world a view thru his eyes...artistry, sexuality, with no color barriers \\"Purple Rain\\" is a masterpiece that deserves to be mentioned with the greatest albums of all time. Prince Freak for life!!!

It may fulfill the need of those readers that have become hostile to religion for a variety of reasons. If this book appeals to you I suspect you would not want to read a book on \\"the delusion of Darwin's apostles\\" which Dawkins certainly qualifies as Darwin's pope.

B000002O51|4.0|Review no. 81. Album number three for Boston, in which most of you likely remember that it took like nearly ten years for America's ace 'arena rock' band to finally come out with it. I've always felt that 'Third Stage' was, in fact up to par (if you would) as far as their first two lp's,the multi-million selling self-titled debut and 'Don't Look Back' (see my reviews of both). Tunes here that sound even more SO familiar than I thought were \\"Amanda\\", the radio friendly \\"We're Ready\\", \\"Cool The Engines\\", \\"My Destination\\" and possibly \\"Holly Ann\\". Put this right along side of those first two Boston CD reissues. Never sounded better. Simply a must-have.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Two driven professionals -- an illustrious detective (Al Pacino) and a sophisticated thief (Robert De Niro) -- draw ever closer to an inevitable showdown on Los Angeles' mean streets. Brilliantly directed by Michael Mann, Heat is a hyperkinetic tale that blurs the lines between good and evil. The all-star cast includes Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Jon Voight.<br /><br />Heat\\" was advertised with the tagline \\"A Los Angeles crime saga.\\" A better description might be that it's a crime novel filmed in its entirity. As much as movie fans would like it to be a showdown between DeNiro and Pacino, Director Michael Mann also tells the small side stories that help drive the confrontation between cop and criminal. From Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd's explosive marriage to the parolee's inevitable fall back into crime, this is no simple movie. Every character is complicated, flawed, but committed to their craft. Mann's direction is at the top of his game, and he effortlessly weaves his themes of existential masculine loneliness, the doppelganger concept, and the cost of professionalism with his trademark gorgeous visuals.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quickie shoot-'em-up, this might not be your cup of tea. If you're looking for a great crime movie that transcends the genre and defines what moviemaking can be at its best (not for nothing, did Martin Scorsese rank this in his top 10 films of the 1990s), then by all means rent \\"Heat.\\"

The blog where he courageously went to share his ideas is also only 30% female in a Democratic Party where women often make up 55% of the electorate.<br /><br />Senator Obama was courageous to visit the DailyKos blog, as he recounted  on page 41 of this book.  But he should take ALL of the blog's criticisms with a health dose of salt.<br /><br />\\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is an excellent book that shows the courage and insight of Senator Obama.  I highly recommend it.
0780619951|5.0|A big-budget remake of the H.G. Wells story (previously filmed in 1977), The Island of Dr. Moreau follows a shipwrecked sailor (David Thewlis) who stumbles upon a mysterious island. He's shocked to discover that a brilliant scientist (Marlon Brando) and his lab assistant (Val Kilmer) have found a way to combine human and animal DNA -- with horrific results.
1594830819|5.0|The audio begins with a sequence of events that has your mind whirling trying to figure out where the story is going and what role do the characters play.  It keeps your attention from the beginning all the way through to the end - so if you only 'casually' listen to the story you will indeed miss something. A story of intrigue you can truly sink your teeth into. James Naughton's reading of the story is done well on this audio.
B00007KWHO|5.0|Stronger than the first album in many ways. Their is not a weak track here and the album was recorded with a small orchestra (a la Moody Blues)  The remastered CD makes it sound like Tony Kayes Hammond Organ is in your living room!
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks .
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen. A great buy. If you don't buy it rent it or borrow it from some one. Serenity is also a great movie. <br /> <br />One technical thing I would note, is that the picture quality seems a bit washed out at times. This does not affect what a great story it is, but if you have a hi def display it is noticeable. THis has not stopped me from watching it repeatedly.

B000JKA0B0|5.0|I've been a R+ fan for over 10 years and have almost every R+ product available. I was so excited to get this-the photo album is beautiful. The videos of the concerts blow you away-especially when you see the fans faces and hear them talking about R+ from Moscow to Tokyo. Truly incredible. I cry everytime I watch the DVDs. Having seen them about 8 times-I was at the Nimes concert so to see the majority of it on a DVD, it's like being back their again. I was front row and center and will never forget each and every concert I've seen-they are an amazing band. Can't go a day without my Rammstein fix!!

B000AMJDHY|4.0|This was my favorite CD of 2006 (even though it came out in 2005).  Panic come out of left field with a bizarre mix of Tin Pan Alley-vaudeville and emo that just shouldn't work and does anyway, just to spite the haters.  How does music like this even happen in the first place?  Do a bunch of band geeks who are really into Rufus Wainwright and the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Irving Berlin showtunes they're rehearsing for the spring concert suddenly get Saves the Day, Smiths and David Bowie CDs for Christmas, rent \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" on DVD, find an Adam Ant cassette and Prince's \\"Lovesexy\\" on vinyl at a garage sale and decide to start a band?   <br /> <br />Panic could have never happened before the 21st century.  Only today's schizophrenic mosaic of genres blaring indiscriminately from TV commercials, mall boutiques, cable movies on demand and cell phone ringtones could've produced a band as willfully eclectic as Panic.  They are a perfect product of the soundtrack generation... kids who have been bludgeoned at every turn with every style of music by marketers who use those genres to evoke specific moods they want to tie in to their product.  Even at their young age, Panic feel out the underlying substance in those genres and wield them as ruthlessly as the media barkers who introduced it to them.  Their musical and visual use of vaudeville is especially shrewd, as it mirrors our modern media's aggrandizement of our personal emotions to evoke the response it wants. <br /> <br />\\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out's\\" songs do not tell a story so much as they describe a movie.  Lyrically they dump the screenplay and paint a picture of what's onscreen, describing in a knowing, sardonic voice archetypes we already know so well, we don't even need a plot to predict how they will act.  We've seen, and imagined ourselves starring in, this movie before.  \\"Fever\\" turns outward from the lyricist's love life and cinematically observes, and emo's hyper-poetic wordiness takes on the richdetail of 35-milimeter film. <br /> <br />This album has that same of-the-moment immediacy as T. Rex or Plastic Bertrand or \\"Heathers.\\"  It means more to its time than it ever will to history.  The accusations of style-over-substance and uber-trendiness are entirely fair and completely miss the point.  \\"Fever\\" sacrifices longevity for a greater impact in the here-and-now.  More 'substantial' music means different things to us at different times in our lives, but \\"Fever\\" will always remind me exactly of who and where I was at the moment I discovered it, in a way no other music made lately can.  I will be pleasantly surprised if Panic's next album furthers their vision, but I won't be disappointed if \\"Fever\\" was their defining moment. <br />
B000G75AE8|5.0|Tom Araya does it again, and the orginal drummer back on this album. Haven't lost a step. Excellent album
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I saw this more than 25 years ago, First Sting solo adventure and was, as today, amazing.  The band (Kirkland, Jones, Marsalis and one of the greatest Omar Hakim) is by far the best band Sting has used on a recording studio and on tour. <br />Don't think about it and buy it!!!!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Aside from \\"Put Your Records On,\\" this album has music that runs together in a pleasant and unobtrusive style.  It would be nice if she did an album also that was all lively stuff like \\"Put Your Records On.\\"  Anyway, the first time I listened to this album, I was not impressed, because it is all fairly low key and even torchy.  On subsequent listenings, she reminds me a little of Sade.  I find that I'm not bonding with any particular song, at least not yet, because they all kind of run together and I don't pick up any particular message yet.  But her overall sound is very pleasing, and not intrusive, and this is nice music to have on while working, one can listen to it or only half listen.
B000J103PC|3.0|Would someone who was given a chance to improve themselves give it all up to make a point ???
B000GBEWHA|5.0|No need to praise this movie anymore than it already has received.  Its just fun to see them sing the songs again 25 years later at the DVD release.   I wish there would be more classic DVDs like this.  Its always fun to get behind the scens and updates.  This is a must for your DVD collection.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|So, the incredibly gifted actor Jared Leto has proven to be a pretty decent musician as well.  With their second album, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", 30 Seconds to Mars have further streamlined their sound without going too commercial (well, not commercial in a bad way, anyway).  Furthermore, they have maintained a pretty distinctive sound, blending raw, earnest alt. metal with a dash of electronic, and a healthy dose of progressive rock.  All in all, it makes for a pretty solid listen.  Jared's vocals are raw and emotive, and his brother Shannon is a powerful, creative drummer (almost like a young Neil Peart, dare I say).<br /><br />This album is full of excellent tracks, such as \\"Attack\\", \\"The Story\\", \\"The Fantasy\\", \\"Savior\\", and the nice acoustic closer \\"A Modern Myth\\", but my fave of the bunch is definitely \\"From Yesterday\\".  In fact, this has become one of my favorite songs of late.  It really boggles the mind that the guy who put on the amazing performance in \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" also wrote this fantastic song.  Makes me wonder what other hidden talents this guy has (he can probably knit a mean sweater as well).<br /><br />There are a few dud tracks, however, namely the two bonus tracks tacked onto the end.  \\"The Hunter\\", in particular, is pretty skippable, sounding like a really bad Deftones impersonation.  But otherwise, this album is pretty damn good.  I'm very interested in hearing what the future holds for Mr. Leto and the rest.<br /><br />(Oh, and my copy doesn't have copyright protection.  Not that I would think of, um, doing such things, of course...)
B000002UYZ|5.0|to give this collection less than a 5 star rating seems impossible, given the fact that the beatles are the standard that all pop music since must be judged by. these tracks are phenomenal, really, a monument to human civilization. it seems impossible that four really young men from one little city in england could be responsible for this. it's also amazing that for once the masses recognized real talent.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It reminded me of my stay at Barcelona instantly. I think the main reason I loved this movie is that it brings out the importance of Friendship. The story is quite good and the performances by all the actors/actresses are amazing! Very funny at times and at the same it is thought provoking. Its a feel good movie. I highly recomment it. BTW, it is a multi-lingual movie, which is another USP for this movie.
B000068FWC|5.0|If there is any kind of formula to Supertramp's music, it's that it combines rich and detailed musicianship with being friendly and accessable to the listener. \\"Breakfast In America\\" is the finest example of this formula because Supertramp executes it superbly on this album. It is, quite simply, Supertramp's masterpiece.     Every song on the album is a winner. The standouts are, of course \\"The Logical Song,\\" which finds John Anthony Helliwell (woodwind instruments) giving one of the greatest saxophone solos in recorded history, as well as the near anthemic \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" and the fun rocker \\"Goodbye Stranger.\\" Even the title track, with it's quirky \\"old world\\" charm and feel, never dulls or becomes tiresome after several listens. Drummer Bob C. Benberg is absolutely brilliant in the way he provides a solid foundation for each song, yet is smart enough to hold back and punctuate when it is needed.    However, it's \\"Breakfast In America's\\" bookend tracks, \\"Gone Hollywood\\" and \\"Child Of Vision\\" that provide the album with its epic tone from start to finish. Supertramp's great bassist Dougie Thomson shines brightly on \\"Child Of Vision,\\"  particularly during the song's second verse. Also notable are guitarist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson's clear-as-a-bell lead vocal throughout and keyboardist Rick Davies' impeccable piano solo at the song's end.    When listening to \\"Breakfast In America,\\" it's no wonder it was a mega hit for the band. This album finds the band at it's most cohesive musically, and the lyrics are delivered with a wink and a smile. The yin and yang trade off of Roger Hodgson's high lead vocals and Rick Davies' lower lead vocals compliment each other beautifully when they're brought together to form their tightly layered harmonies.    \\"Breakfast In America\\" is my all time favorite album - period. I've gone through the original LP, two cassette versions and two CD versions and it still sounds as fresh as it did when it was played on my sisters' recordplayer back in 1979. It is the album I point to when I introduce Supertramp to a future fan of the band.     What's also fun to know: \\"Breakfast In America\\" won a Grammy award for best album cover design in 1979.    Though it's hard to see on the CD cover, the waitress' name tag on the front cover says \\"Libby,\\" which is appropriate because she is depicted as the Statue of Liberty as seen out of an airplane window.    The band has a sense of humor too. In the photo on the album's back cover, Rick Davies is shown pouring sugar in his coffee, but the newspaper he's reading is blocking it from going into his coffee cup.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|Il Divo is now my favorite group after recently hearing them on Oprah! Their voices are incredible and can relax you after a hectic day. Beautiful music, but I can only give a 4 star rating since there is only one song in English on this CD. Still nice listening, but I can't sing along much.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Note:  This review is by a high school English teacher. <br /> <br />First, the objections of some other viewers are correct.  The plot IS predictable and the message IS politically correct.  A little girl who is destined to be the new leader of her patriarchal tribe has to prove herself against the stubborn resistance and willful blindness of her grandfather, who is the current tribal chieftain.  Obviously, the film is not going to end with her being packed off to a nunnery. <br /> <br />Now onto the real meat of this film - stupendous spirituality, near perfect story execution, hauntingly magical presentation, rich cultural content and of course, Keisha Castle-Hughes, who was apparently born to light up a movie screen with her eyes. <br /> <br />If you are teaching world literature, I would honestly put this film in my top 20 of all time for that purpose.  One writing prompt I used was, \\"What cultures do you claim as your own, and what can you tell me about them?\\"  This prompt caused such an animated discussion about culture, especially in the wake of the film, that it had to spill over into the next class. <br /> <br />BTW - in my opinion, the \\"PG-13\\" rating is completely unwarranted, and \\"PG\\" would have been spot-on.  However, I can't speak for your own cultural or personal sensibilities, and I would certainly recommend a complete pre-viewing before you show it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I had never really paid attention to John Mayer's music until I heard \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\".  On a whim I bought the cd and I love it.  I can't stop listening to it.  Infact I'm going to purchase \\"Heavier Things\\" and I'm sure I'll enjoy it too!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|PLOT/STORY: nice space frontier adventure with the feeling of true exploration.  No motives such as \\"To go where no man ...\\" but just living and trading by, well, . If you enjoyed the feeling of ENTERPRISE (year 1 or so), you'll enjoy this.  Sort of like \\"Lost in Space\\" without the \\"Lost\\" and without the \\"Monsters\\" or \\"Robot\\".  Technology is also believable and not too far fetched. No phasers, shields or photon torpedoes, Romulans, etc.  However, there are some MYSTERY elements involved and I won't spoil it for you. <br />ACTING: excellent and beautiful mix of characters and cultures. <br />TRANSFER: excellent and full-screen <br />MUSIC: catchy fiddle and banjo-- nice touch!  Inspirational! <br />CASE: the way that they should be.  Disks are single sided and cases are polypropylene (flexible) so that disks can be inserted/removed WITHOUT damage. <br />SUBTITLES: English subtitles available so great for learning English as well. <br />EXTRAS: nice assortment including auditions, gag reel, and behind the scenes <br />CONCLUSION: buy it! Great entertainment PLUSE the episodes are \\"re-watchable\\"!  The $25 set includes 14 episodes and the $45 set (maybe) includes the Serenity movie as well.  I went for the $25 set. <br /> <br />
B000LC3IDI|3.0|This movie is terrible and sick. I never wanna see It again I have never seen nobody so sick minded and make people suffer. part 1. was crazy and scary. 2. was good and 3. was ok but to much suffering and killing.

0446528056|5.0|Just as I was about to give up on Nicholas Sparks after reading a string of mediocre novels following his first three blockbuster hits, I decided to give him one more chance.  I'm glad I did!  This is by far the best book he's written--even better than \\"The Notebook\\" and the two that followed, \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"A Walk to Remember.\\" I started reading \\"Dear John\\" at 8 PM one evening and couldn't put it down until I finished in the wee hours of the morning.  Written in the first person by the young male protagonist, John Tyree, he tells the heartwarming story of his romance with the girl of his dreams--Savannah Lynn Curtis, whom he meets by chance one day on the beach.  Their background and personalities are strikingly different, but yet they form an unexplainable bond that grows into a powerful love.  Savannah is almost too good to be true, and I kept thinking: \\"Gee, I wish my son (who is John's age) could meet a girl like that!\\"  I won't go into any details to spoil the plot, which turns out to have many twists and turns--not only involving John's relationship with Savannah but also a heartwarming story concerning John's father, John's time in the service, and his thoughts and emotions in general.  This is a beautiful story, and frankly when I finished it left me emotionally drained where I wasn't able to get back to sleep just thinking about it.  Not only is \\"Dear John\\" an entertaining read, but it was very well written and fast paced with a stirring conclusion. Congratulations to Nicholas Sparks on another winner!

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I am a period drama aficionado and count \\"North & South,\\" \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Wives & Daughters\\" among my top favorites. I was keenly awaiting this new version of Jane Eyre as I count the earlier version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke as one of my favorite dramas. <br /> <br />This \\"Jane Eyre\\" has notable differences to earlier versions and they are, in most cases, good differences.  The same attention to detail, care, fine locations, engaging storyline, and superb acting and production values that you would expect from the BBC are present this version of JE. The cast is led by Toby Stephens (a favorite since his \\"Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" days) and newcomer Ruth Wilson. Most of us already know the story and I am pleased to report that the screenwriter has done a good job of staying true (in most cases) to the book.  The screenplay and locations lend to the gothic and atmospheric feel of this version, and there is some beautiful cinematography throughout.   <br /> <br />I quite like Toby Stephens as Rochester. He is very different from Timothy Dalton's (my favorite version) portrayal but is good all the same. I think perhaps I wish he (Toby) was a little more stern or a little more of a brooding presence. I always thought of Rochester as a brooding, mercurial hero in my mind since I read the book years ago, and this difference between the book Rochester and Toby's portrayal doesn't always mesh.  While watching I found myself wondering what it would've been like if Richard Armitage (from \\"North & South\\") had played Rochester instead!  Ruth Wilson is pitch perfect, on the other hand. Her Jane is both strong and intelligent, but vulnerable all the same.   Francesca Annis, Christina Cole, Tara Fitzgerald and Georgie Henley are quite good in their supporting roles. <br /> <br />I suppose one thing that may set the purists on fire are some of the changes (call it \\"modernizing\\" the story?) made to this adaptation.  There is certainly more kissing and passion- only alluded to and not often seen in the book and earlier versions - no doubt to make it appeal to modern audiences.  Although I like some kissing here and there, I must admit that \\"less is more\\" in this case. This Rochester is also far more likeable and appealing than his predecessors - and in my heart I wish he was a little more complex.  I like this version - not love it - and because of this I will only give 4 stars.  If I had loved it like I love \\"North & South\\" and even the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke \\"Jane Eyre,\\" then it would've gotten 5 stars in my book. <br /> <br />I do recommend this adaptation to fans of period drama, especially if you are a Bronte fan.  It is well worth seeing and I have no doubt that many of you will become Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson fans by the end.  I believe that it is a fine addition to any British period drama fans dvd library. <br /> <br />
1401907725|5.0|This deck is absolutely beautiful from the artwork to the golden edges of the cards.  Each card has a theme with a paragraph of an inspiring message. <br /> <br />This was the fifth oracle card deck made by Doreen Virtue that I have bought (out of the eight I currently own).  Despite the beauty of the cards, I found this one more difficult to use than her other decks at first because I personally prefer cards that do not have a lot of writing on them.  But, once you got the hang of the cards a bit more, they were very enjoyable to use. <br /> <br />Some people work better with cards that have a lot of writing on them.  If you are one of these people, then this is a great first deck of Oracle Cards for you to start with.  Another deck that is good as a starter for this type is the \\"Messages From Your Angels\\" deck. <br /> <br />Others work better with cards that have very little written on them and are based mostly on the picture...like me.  If you're like me, do not start with this deck.  You're better off with \\"Healing With the Angels Oracle Cards,\\" and \\"Healing With the Fairies Oracle Cards.\\"  My first deck was \\"Goddess Guidance Oracle Cards,\\" which has worked for me very well every time I have used it. <br /> <br />Either way, this deck is wonderful, but buy it accordingly (if you plan to do so) to what I have just stated as it will help you enjoy it much more.  ^_^
B000K4WPCM|2.0|Just consider it a male version of \\"The Craft\\" -- \\"The Covenant\\" is basically a flimsy witchcraft story dressed up with lots of male eye candy. The candy is nice for the eyes, but it would have been nice to have a little meat for the brain as well.<br /><br />Ipswich has four (used to be five) witch families, and the eldest son inherits a dangerous bunch of magic in his early teens, before coming into his full power at eighteen (do I smell another magic/sexual maturity analogy here?). They mainly use these powers as... well, the way you'd expect any teen boys to. But then the body of a student is found in a car, and the sons of Ipswich are suspected.<br /><br />And Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) starts to figure out that something weird is happening -- ghosts, magical peeping-toms, and a mysterious student who just transferred there. Not only must Caleb stop the magical attacks -- but keep his own burgeoning powers under control too, as he confronts the secret enemy.<br /><br />\\"The Covenant\\" is pure fluff from start to finish, and at times it feels like it isn't aspiring to be much more -- the plot is quite basic and rather suspenseless, since the bad guy practically has a \\"REALLY SINISTER AND CREEPY\\" sign around his neck -- and a five-year-old could guess who he is just by the backstory.<br /><br />In a way, it feels bad to kick such an unpretentiously popcorn movie, but it could have been way better -- instead, it's loaded with with cliches galore. There are a few cool scenes, such as a car flying apart and reconstructing -- quite nice, visually speaking.<br /><br />But the rest of the time, it's just predictable and rather cheesy -- dialogue is extremely teen-movie (\\"You ready to say \\"uncle\\"?\\" \\"I'm ready for you to go to hell!\\"), and the climax is like a magic-powerball-throwing fight from a bad children's anime.<br /><br />The actors are there basically for the looks, and they form a pretty typical circle -- good boy, shy boy, bad boy, and mischief-maker. Not great acting, but most of them won't make you openly cringe. And of course, they toss in some teen-movie starlets, who don't really register, as the token girlfriends.<br /><br />\\"The Covenant\\" is pure popcorn, with a load of cliches -- might be fun for a watch after two A.M., when nothing else is on.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I bought this CD several months ago and I am still listening to the songs frequently (as in several times a day). <br /> <br />This is a symphonic metal band with a female fronted voice.  The songs range from fast and heavy, like \\"Wish I Had An Angel,\\" to the lighter and melodic, \\"Nemo.\\"  Later in the cd is a song, \\"Ghost Love Score,\\" which is very epic and somewhat soundtrack-ish sounding and also very beautiful. <br /> <br />This song has elements that will make you think of high fantasy and mythology.

B000LPS3B2|5.0|\\"Shutter,\\" offers nothing new in the horror genre, in regards to what one expects from horror. However, what impressed me with the film is that it is the first feature film by both of the Thai directors, Bangjong Pisanthankun and Parkpoom Wongpoom. And given that Thailand does not have a very large, or great pedigree in the horror film market in comparison to Japan, this film is a worthy effort. The films main protagonist is named Tun (Ananda Everingham), and he portrays a photographer whose past is about to catch up to him. Tun and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) are driving home late one night after drinking and entertaining friends at a club, when suddenly their  car hits someone in the dark. Since both were drinking, Tun decides it best to leave the scene of the accident.<br /><br />Nothing will be the same for the two after this incident. Moreover, there is something in Tun's past [no spoilers] which will have a significant impact on his life. Soon strange occurances begin to happen. The photographs that Tun snaps appear to show strange shapes and figures in them. Thinking that these exposures were defective, or the careless acts of the developer, Tun insists that a mistake has been made. It is either his camera, or defective film. Soon Tun's friends begin to die suddenly: All by by suicide; and each of them have a connection to Tun and his past. Thinking that the car accident was the reason for the now unexplained events that are occuring in his life, Tun and Jane begin to look into this matter. However, the true reason behind these events are much more ominous  and sinister.<br /><br />While the film does have some elements of other horror films in the film, they are more out of an influence than genuine copying. Furthermore, this is typical of the horror genre, including American horror films. Many borrow from each other. Having written this, I would also like to point out that there are many elements in this film which you will not see in MANY horror films: Like a story. The strength of this film is the journey that Tun and Jane must go through in trying to untangle the mess that their life has now suddenly taken. Further, the acting is very good in this film. Plus there are no special effects, or silly gore scenes. All in all, I thought this was a very good film, and for that it gets 5 stars. I have the import DVD, purchased through Asia Cinema. Therefore, I don't know how well this current DVD copy is. However, I do recommend the film. It will make a nice addition to your foreign cinema collection.

B00005JPGM|5.0|I saw the movie last weekend with a friend. accent <br />It is a brilliant movie. The best of 2006.  <br />It has a very serious subject. Leo gives an amazing performance. I was shocked by this movie - it opens your eyes of what is happening in Africa (I cried a lot).  <br />I am very proud of Leo that he did this movie. I wished this movie would be more recognized by the public and critics.  <br />It is sad that that it is not nominated for best picture at the oscars. But I am so happy that Leo got nominated. He is breathtaking. My friend who saw the movie with me, lived in Africa for 6 years.

She said, nobody could have done it better. <br /> <br />It is a really important movie (not just an action movie).  <br />My friend and I think that this movie should be shown also in schools (for older students), because it shows the real world.  <br /> <br />WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!

0307236722|5.0|This book is an extensive collection of the best baking recipes from Martha Stewart.  It's definitely not the kind of cookbook you use once and then put away for months.  It's got the usual recipes, but some very unique ones as well. Its my go-to book for baking anything.  It may not be for the baker that doesn't mind using store bought cookie dough, but there are some easy ways to bybass the time-consuming parts - like buying frozen puff pastry dough for example.  I'd recommend it to anyone who truly enjoys the entire baking process.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|_The Illusionist_ is an excellent and entertaining film with a unique story detailing the efforts of a young magician to win the love of a woman.  The story is set in 1900s Vienna, and the costumes and scenery are certainly appropriate for that time period.  The story traces the life of a young magician (who was first taught by a wandering magician he came in contact with) as he meets with a young Duchess and tries to win her love.  However, the two are forced to separate because the young man is a peasant and the Duchess is royalty and such an accommodation is inconceivable to the people of the time.  After their forced separation the young magician travels to the Orient where he learns the secrets of the \\"dark arts\\".  It is only then that he returns to Vienna as the illusionist and stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton).  The magic tricks of Eisenheim are particularly complex, and seeing as how they have no apparent and conceivable manner in which they could be accomplished many attribute them to the supernatural.  It is while performing on stage however that Eisenheim meets with the Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel) again in a daring encounter with death that invokes the immortality of the soul.  As it turns out however, Duchess Sophie is to be wed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who not only challenges the tricks of the magician but also is notoriously ruthless and cruel (and even rumored to have beaten his previous mistress and possibly killed her).  The story involves a profound encounter with death and raises the question of the nature of the soul.  Indeed, the police Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is also to enter this story as the plot unravels.  Ultimately a conflict ensues between the Crown Prince and the magician that must be settled in a very disturbing manner.  Further, the emerging spiritualist movement plays some role in this story as the magician invokes the spirits of the dead.  Spiritualism (which was often linked to socialism and various reform movements) is invoked by the people as a means to achieve a \\"spiritual republic\\".  Such subversive activities are of course frowned upon by the powers that be.  The movie ultimately raises the question of the existence of the supernatural and the survival of the soul after death.  To see how this is resolved within the movie, you must watch it.  However, as a story the movie is a classic tale of love that knows no bounds (neither the separation in social class nor the separation of the grave can drive the lovers apart).  I found this movie to be excellently done.  The story is interesting, the magic tricks are impressive, the characters were well played, and the setting was as I would expect the turn-of-the-century in Vienna.  As a love story this movie is a classic and is sure to provide a night's worth of entertainment.us reform movements) is invoked by the people as a means to achieve a \\"spiritual republic\\".

0312932081|5.0|I have read Ender's Game at least 6 times and ADORE it. The main character, Ender, is easy to relate to and the reader is allowed to explore his complex psycological and emotional life as he follows the archetypical heroic path. Through his experiences, Ender and his siblings in the novel reveal the true nature of humans and survival. <br /> <br />I have multiple copies of this book because I like to give them out to people and share the joy I got from this book with others. It is so moving, educational, and pertinent to the present day. Young readers will relate to the \\"kids\\" in the book (who are mini-soldiers with immense responsibilites) and adults will be deeply familiar with the pressures, emotions, and challenges that come with grown-up responsibilities. This book has wide appeal and is also very entertaining. Page-turners don't come around often enough, but rest assured that this book is one of the few that catch one's interest and imagination immediately.  <br /> <br />Someone once said this book is about children but not necessarily for children. I agree. It is an awesome novel that anyone can enjoy, and it is mature enough in its content that adults can appreciate and love this book even more than children can.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I was a fan of Madonna in her early years, and even in the 90s she wasn't all that bad. Yet her newest works, including Confessions, just leaves a whole lot to be desired. Her songs are just empty with the same old cliche lyrics that now at her age just make her sound immature. A woman her age I think should have a lot more intelligent things to be saying that's all. Also a lot of her songs just are uninteresting to the point of boring these days.  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the album overall is not horrible. There are some songs that prove likeable such as Hung Up, Sorry, Push and especially Forbidden Love- which is a very beautiful song. Other than these mentioned songs though the rest of the album is nothing worth buying. Her older stuff is much better, but old Madonna fans may want to at least try this one out just for the sake of being a fan for so long. For sure there will be a song or two that will catch your ear, but that's about it to me. <br /> <br />3/5
B000GPI2EK|2.0|From what others have said about this album, 'Blood Mountain' must be the best thing since sliced bread, and its release the greatest event since Armstrong set foot on the moon. Those lauding this album include virtually every respectable music journo around. Look at the reviews posted by the others here on Amazon - all raving about this alleged masterpiece. Surely, so many people can't be wrong? That's why I just took the plunge and bought the CD without even listening to any tracks first. <br /> <br />My impression? The only thing I can compare it to was watching Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" about 2-3 months after it was released. By then, the movie was so hyped that when I watched it I couldn't help but be disappointed. I thought to myself then: 'yeah, it's good ... but it's nowhere near as good as what they said it would be; it's not the \\"Godfather\\" or \\"Star Wars\\", is it?' This is more or less what I felt after listening to 'Blood Mountain'. It's OK and it does have its moments. But 'album of the decade' ? Er ... I can think of several albums I bought just this month that were better IMHO. <br /> <br />The music is 'nice' but not epic. It has some fine touches of sophistication, and is surprisingly mature for a supposed metal album. The mood is very surreal and dream-like (nightmarish?). It certainly is not your run-of-the-mill black/death/thrash/Gothic metal. I commend Mastodon for creating a very cohesive album, where all the songs fit neatly into a strong narrative theme - creating a consistent and lasting 'feel' and vibe. It's like drinkng a fine single malt Scotch. The taste is strong, heavy and not to everyone's taste - but it's the finish that lingers on on your tongue and keeps you intrigued. This really is an album to be savored in its entirety - as opposed to picking and listening only to one or two 'favorite' songs. <br /> <br />But that's all I can say for it. For me, most other aspects were unexceptional. The songs are decently heavy with a few nice hooks,but hardly melodic or grand. The riffs are chaotic and wild but not very memorable. The lyrics are lazy repeats of cliched phrases taken from the horror novel lexicon. The drum work and guitars are professional but unspectacular. There is nothing musically heroic to compare with a young Ulrich or Benante on drums, a Van Halen or King or Li/Totman on the 6-strings. If the entire album was an instrumental, I could still live with it. But for me, the weakest part of the album is probably the vocals. It is yet more sludgy, inarticulate rasping in the post-grunge subterranean mould - it sounds like a Lovecraft story reads, but you can barely make out what's being sung (or rather growled). It's simply awful on the ears. Doubtless, there are many fans of this type of animal noise 'singing' - but for others the noise may induce a headache not unlike that experienced with the hangover after downing several bottles of Jagermeister the night before. <br /> <br />I expect after a review like this, many Mastodon fans would like to send me hateful messages and question my metal credentials. But let me say this. I have a very open mind when it comes to music. I have enjoyed metal for 3 decades - from Sabbath to Van Halen/Malmsteen to Metallica/Slayer to grunge to nu-metal/Slipknot to death/black to the recent power metal resurgence. I've been to metal concerts on 3 continents, listening to every sub-genre around. I love 'em all. I tried very very hard to like this album. I listened to it again and again until the induced headache threatened to split my head in two, trying to convince myself that this album was as good as people said it was. After all, I didn't want to be the odd one out. I didn't want to be the only guy around thinking the world was flat. But you know what? I just couldn't 'like' this album. I don't hate it, but I'd only give it 2-3 stars, not 6 stars out of 5 like everyone else.  <br /> <br />At the end of the day, what metal has meant to me all these years is saying \\"I can walk my own way and I don't care what you think\\". I guess that applies to anyone appreciating any form of art. Everyone should have their own opinion ... then live and let live. My own opinion is that 'Blood Mountain' is like the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone on the bandwagon seems to be saying how beautiful the clothes are, and I feel like the only kid on the block who can see them for what they really are.

B000J10ERO|4.0|There's a lot that is supremely well done about this expensive-looking 2006 revival of the long dormant blockbuster franchise, and having the talented Bryan Singer (\\"X-Men\\", \\"The Usual Suspects\\") helm it was a smart decision since he has proven abilities in creating a singular cinematic vision without compromising the integrity of the story at its core. However, the overriding challenge centers more on the somber, almost reverential tone that Singer has felt a need to imbue the film. That's not to say there are not thrilling moments or even some comic ones, but the most pervasive sense in the epic-length movie is the priority placed in sustaining the mythic stature of Superman and reusing familiar elements from the previous films to ensure we are not disappointed with any possible discontinuity with the legend. I just wish Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris could have looked a little deeper into the irony of a superhero now that we are dealing with a greater sense of ambiguity between good and evil.<br /><br />The film picks up the story about five years after the end of 1980's \\"Superman II\\" as the superhero returns to Earth after a lengthy sabbatical in which he was futilely trying to find survivors of his home planet Krypton. The world has fallen into inevitable chaos in the interim, but more pertinent, his longtime love Lois Lane has moved on with her life. Still a star reporter at the Daily Planet with a Pulitzer Prize in hand, she now lives with fellow reporter Richard White, the nephew of editor Perry White, and has a young sickly son. Meanwhile, arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, released from prison, embarks on a diabolical plan to create a new continent and destroy North America using the Kryptonian crystals he steals from the Fortress of Solitude. From this elaborate set-up, the plot covers pretty familiar ground for most of the duration, but it is punctuated by some amazing sequences like the young hero's discovery of his powers over gravity in a cornfield, the derring-do rescue of a 737 with Lois aboard, and Superman's misty-eyed airborne seduction of Lois. The story takes an intriguing turn when things look the bleakest for our hero in the last third, but it all ends with the door unsurprisingly wide open for a sequel.<br /><br />Although he has a tendency to look a bit glassy-eyed, Brandon Routh turns out to be an ideal choice for a sincere and somewhat melancholy take on the icon. When he reverts to alter-ego Clark Kent, he seems to be channeling his predecessor Christopher Reeve's bumbling charm, which makes these gratefully brief scenes feel a bit derivative. Given Kevin Spacey's innate tendency toward hamminess, I am surprised that he doesn't seem more inspired by Luthor's utter villainy and satirical sense of cruelty. It's as if the fun has been exhumed out of his performance. Following in Valerie Perrine's footsteps, Parker Posey plays Luthor's moll with air-headed assurance, though the actress' idiosyncratic persona is not fully utilized here. The most problematic casting, however, comes with Kate Bosworth as Lois. Sincere and as committed as she seems to be in the role, she lacks the gravitas and maturity to be remotely convincing as such an accomplished woman. Eva Marie Saint barely has any screen time as Martha Kent, and outtakes of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's deceased father, are used rather cryptically near the beginning.<br /><br />Not too surprisingly, the film is much more visually lustrous than its inspiration thanks to Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography, Guy Dyas' production design (especially of Metropolis) and the truly superb special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD set has the 154-minute movie on the first disc though unfortunately without a commentary track from Singer, the screenwriters or the principals. The second disc offers extras that would be of interest to fanatics, specifically a five-part documentary that lasts nearly three hours and should have been really edited down for the general audience. There is a quick short, \\"Resurrecting Jor-El\\", that is somewhat interesting to see how the Brando footage was prepared, as well as fifteen minutes of relatively uninteresting deleted scenes.audience.

B000HT386M|2.0|<br />The acting is ordinary, no brilliant special effects and nothing deep or original as I am sure I have seen something similar. It is a silly film about a man who has a family and career and puts his career first. He gets this remote control which enables him to manipulate much of his life. Eventually it ruins his life and he finds out that he needs his family first. So we have a Hollywood happy ending that makes it right. <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00004XOWM|4.0|alright looks heres the deal.  I know what real metal is.  I listen to Slayer, Iron Maiden, Priest, whatever you guys want to call \\"real metal\\".  I also know what real metal/hardcore musicians sound like.  I listen to Psyopus, All Shall Perish, Into The Moat, Meshuggah etc. So  <br />MY POINT IS: you can not deny what the band does in these songs.  Whether its nookie, my way, boiler, just like this, or whatever, the songs are amazingly well written and put together.  Now, granted, I will be the first to admit that Fred Durst is a f**king idiot and some of the stuff he says....is just retarted.  But the SONGS are good and 4/5 of the band knows what the hell they are doing.  Hence, I given them 4 stars. <br />I would rather listen to this than most of the music thats coming out nowadays. Why complain about Limp Bizkit, Korn or the Deftones when music like My Chemical Romance and that new AFI album is coming out right now.  All I'm saying that if you actually go and listen to these songs, you will realize that there is enough substance to make it worth while.  I really used to like this stuff when I was in middle school and now that I'm old enough to realize why, its good again. <br />So don't judge so fast like I always did.

B000M53GM2|5.0|In \\"Goldeneye\\", James Bond, played for the first time by Pierce Brosnan, must prevent an ex-MI6 agent, Alec Trevelyan, from detonating a powerful electromatic pulse, via satellite, over London. The pulse would render all electronics in London totally useless, and Trevelyan would seize that opportunity to electronically rob the Bank Of London. Along the way, Bond is assisted by computer programmer Natalya Simonova, who has extensive knowledge of the goldeneye satellite. Bond's other enemies throughout the movie include Trevelyan's sidekick, Russian General Ouromov (who has betrayed his government); Boris, a computer programmer who was once a comrade of Natalya, but betrayed her; and Zenia Onatopp, a dark, sexually charged woman who takes pleasure in making love, and killing. She especially enjoys killing WHILE making love ;) <br /> <br />The feel of \\"Goldeneye\\" is rather dark and serious, although there are comical moments strewn throughout the movie (so it's not quite as stiff as either of Dalton's Bond movies). There are a wide array of characters featured in the movie, all of whom are thoroughly enjoyable, and well written. The actors playing them are especially entertaining to watch. Kudos to Izabella Scorupco, who is not only gorgeous, but plays the part of Natalya very memorably. Famke Janssen is also magnificent as Onatopp, and there has not been any Bond villian quite as quirky or devilish as Onatopp since (what Bond villainess has ever licked Bond's face, and then beaten him up? Just Onatopp!). Pierce Brosnan, of course, fits right in as James Bond, and manages to combine elements of a dark edge with a touch of a light side. <br /> <br />\\"Goldeneye\\" works very well as a Bond movie. The plot is intruiging, and moves along at a perfect pace, keeping the viewer interested. The action sequences in the movie are very well done, immensely enjoyable to watch. Eric Serra's music fits the movie PERFECTLY, and in my opinion, the producers should have invited him backfor more films. His score adds a dark undertone to the movie, something which all of Brosnan's Bond movies afterwards would painfully lack.  <br /> <br />Characterization is also important in the movie. One of the most memorable scenes has Bond sitting on a Caribbean beach at sunset, staring out at the ocean, and thinking about his inevitable confrontation with Trevelyan, who used to be an old friend. Natalya walks over to Bond, and questions how he can be so cold, so dark. \\"It's what keeps me alive,\\" Bond replies, before the two of them go off to make love. It's a shame Brosnan was not given more scenes such as this one in future Bond films... it certainly makes \\"Goldeneye\\" unique, and deep.
B00024YVJU|5.0|When I think about Eloy, the first thing that comes to my mind is WOWwww!! <br />Their early work (pr-80s) stuff was one of the all-time top3 best Prog/Space Rock Albums ever done in the history of music. <br />It's only sad that they never got the attention they deserved. <br />Eloy captures your heart and ears right away with groovy and complex music patterns, resonant bass lines and incredible drums. <br />All musicians are top notch and they demonstrate their musical abilities exceptionally in each album to the point where one thinks :\\"Can this get any better??\\" <br />All their albums are concept albums, like Pink Floyd, so that's why I'd compare them with Pink Floyd. To me Eloy is Germany's answer to Pink Floyd, although they might not be in the exact genre, but they both take you on a trip to somewhere else (even without 420). <br />If you would like to get acquainted with ELoy and you already have a taste for Space/Atmosphere Rock, I'd start with Ocean and Down and then go to their live album. <br />Just listen to the drums and bass lines and observe how incredibly beautiful they weave into each other almost effortlessly. <br />I wished we could see one last live performance of Eloy in the US <br />
B000K7UBTI|5.0|As the title states, I'm not an Iron Man fan. I never read any of the Iron Man comics. I bought this DVD only because I enjoyed the Marvel Avengers DVDs and wanted to get a closer look at the man inside of the iron. <br /> <br />From this movie alone, I was able to see many different sides of Iron Man including his romantic relationships, his tense relationship with his father, his treatment of friendships, and his will when behind the mask. Although this is not a true-to-form representation of his origins as depicted in the comics, it is a very compelling story of his origins nontheless. At first I was a little dissapointed to know the main setting for confrontation was going to be a Chinese setting (it is becoming overused). However, the further into the film I got, the more quickly I decided there was an involving enough story being told here that the seemingly overused setting didn't matter. <br /> <br />It soon became clear to me why the main confrontational setting took place where and how it did; contrast. What better contrast to a technologically advanced flying iron man than an ancient civilization that goes as far back as the Chinese civilization depicted here does? <br /> <br />For someone like me, a non-Iron Man fan, this animated feature allowed me to see little bits and pieces of Tony Stark's and Iron Man's life. Because the entire story of his origins had to fit in one film instead of a series, I only get glimpses of each side of him. But it is enough to get a clear picture of him and understand him as a whole. Along the way of discovering who and what Iron Man is, I get to see it be told with a contrasting but fitting storyline. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie has let me know enough about Iron Man that it has turned me into an Iron Man fan. Maybe this animated film is not for hardcore Iron Man fans, but it is certainly a story worth appreciating and seeing.
015603283X|5.0|This book was a real treasure house for me, like taking a literaure class without all the academia. This book lead me on to other works and authors that I missed in my evidently not-so-rounded education, including Eugene Sue, The Devil in Love, Rafael Sabatini, and prompted re-readings of Dumas. The storyline is full of history and literary background that puts Dumas and the adventure serial into context. The mystery is a fun puzzle, and made me feel intelligent (I also now own a Latin dictionary). Kudos also to Sonia Soto, who was able to translate puns and poetic meter without a hitch. This is a great story as a mystery novel, but I think it will be most enjoyed by those who find magic in the staying power of literature.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It had a great story line and the plot twists were well timed. Natalie Portman did a good job at being a scared girl turned revolutionary. This movie reminded me of George Orwell's masterpiece 1984. The citizens are not as afraid of the government in this movie, but there are definitely similarities. I was disappointed with the end, and not because it was a bad conclusion but because what I thought was going to happen didn't. For those who have not seen this film I do not want to spoil it with silly summaries of the plot. I will say, however, that this movie is better to rent than buy. I don't think it has nearly the same effect if you continuously watch it like some movies do.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|The reviewer who gave this movie two stars and made the comment related to the \\"rubs against reality\\", didn't grow up in a family like mine... <br />;)  :) <br /> <br />My husband and I loved this move, and thought it was hilarious -- it made us both laugh -- REALLY laugh -- at a time when we needed it.  I was reading the reviews because after seeing the movie,  I'm about to buy the DVD for myself and for my brother as a gift (I know he'll like it, too!) and I wondered why it wasn't rated five stars. <br /> <br />For me this movie highlights some of the craziness you can encounter in \\"reality\\", and shows the humor in it.  It shows a family of folks going through difficulties and stress -- and while all of these folks are very different, the bottom line is they accept each other for who they truly are (even with all the differences and conflict) and love and support each other.  That's a beautiful message and a state to strive for.  Coupled with the humor, well, to me it just doesn't get much better than this.  GREAT MOVIE!!! <br /> <br />As to the two-star reviewer -- well, guess it just goes to show, to each their own. <br />I LOVE this movie, and highly recommend it.  :)
B000LC3ID8|4.0|Horror franchises aren't known for maintaining the energy and excitement of the first films in the respective series. I really enjoyed the first Saw - while it does have its flaws, I still think it was a refreshing film in comparison to the other horror movies that were coming out at the time. With that said, if you didn't enjoy the first Saw, you're not going to enjoy Saw 3 so don't bother. <br /> <br />Saw 3 picks up immediately after Saw II and while it is a horror movie so we're not talking about The Brothers Karamazov in terms of plot and character development, the viewer will enjoy Saw 3 more if the two previous films have been seen. <br /> <br />Ultimately it seems that the Saw movies come down to the traps and the twist ending. It seemed like the second Saw was all traps and the twist ending wasn't that surprising (some would say a cliche). Saw 3 has some very good traps but there's also some that seem unrealistic or shot poorly. Overall, they were okay - some definite moments that will stay with you but others that were just silly. As for the twist ending, I didn't get on board. It just seemed like the producers were so desperate to outdo themselves that they brainstormed all the possible twists they could come up with and threw them all in.  <br /> <br />But even with those criticisms, I still had a good time with the film. I think it fits well into the series and while neither Saw 2 or 3 have matched the first film, they both stand up as welcome additions.

B000L43AN4|5.0|Wow, this caught me by surprise.  Some really great ballads, some remakes of old tunes like Good Night Irene and some of the most funky stuff I have ever heard.  Waits has hit the mark with this one.  A lot of great political commentary with more material on three cd's than I could ever imagine. He must have gone on a (writing) binge. Some of it sounds like the Salvation Army Band and others are so mellow and beautiful.  I suspect Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave if he has heard Heigh Ho.  However, it is a faithful rendition, at least as far as the words being there.  Over all a big thumbs up.  I lost the [...] CD when I gave my player away and forgot to remove it.  Oh well, I will just have to skrimp and buy another copy as I liked it better than anything I have ever heard Waits do.
068987474X|5.0|I saw this book being talked about on Oprah a couple of years ago and ordered it right away.  I love Sex and the City and remember the episode where Berger's character tells Miranda that the guy she went on a date with 'just wasn't into' her because he didn't want to go upstairs with her after the date.  I, like the other characters on the show, was flabbergasted. Greg Behrendt was a contributor to SATC and the whole story line and this book came from a discussion he happened to be hearing between several female writers of the show.  One had been on a date, but hadn't heard from the guy in a couple of days.  All the women were making excuses for him (he's busy at work, he's just playing games, etc).  The woman asked Greg for his male opinion and he just said \\"He's just not that into you\\".  When that line made its way onto the show, it made me angry.  But this book makes me feel liberated.  If a guy doesn't show interest in you, it's not because you're not pretty enough, thin enough, rich enough, or whatever.  He's JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU and when you can accept it and move on, it's a glorious feeling.  The main concept of the book is don't ever change who you are for a man.  There is a man out there who will love you for who you are, and if you never meet him, it's his loss.  I recommend this book to any single female.

I was looking forward to this Ironman DVD.  All in all, I enjoyed it, but the whole retro vibe didn't work for me.  The cars look like they're from 1950, and the China setting--everybody looked like they came out of some Fu Manchu movie from 1930.  I would have rather seen them do a complete modern update.  I really liked the use of CGI though.  I thought it looked really cool and worked well.

I thought this movie was much better than having some people trapped in a house. There was only really 1 twist in Saw II, but Saw III is filled w/ different twists and turns in the climactic last 10 minutes of the film. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of good horror films.
B000FVGMC4|4.0|I'm sure this guy is about to blow up and get really popular.  So pick up the Import and say you heard him first!  This guy is going to be all over VH1's Top 20 Countdown in 2007.  <br /> <br />\\"These Streets\\" is a very impressive debut.  It's hard to believe he's only 18/19 years old.  He has a great sound to him.  He has a very soulful voice that sounds much older than he is. <br /> <br />It's sort of singer/songwriter-sounding but with a lot more production.  I read that production was handled by one of Coldplay's producers.  I think if you're a Coldplay fan, you'd probably dig Paolo. <br /> <br />I have a hard time categorizing this.  I can only say that it falls into the category of \\"good music.\\"  He's kind of like a less-depressing, much better version of James Blunt.  All ten tracks are solid - no real duds in the bunch.  Good stuff from a promising artist! <br /> <br />(One minor gripe... the last track, which contains a Hidden Track, is 14 minutes long.  So if you're going to rip this to your MP3 player, then you're stuck listening to the whole 14 minutes as one track.  A minor annoyance for a good album.)
B000LC3ID8|5.0|The third installment of the Saw chronicles was much better than the second which I thought got a bit cheesy at the end.  The third movie was extremely gory (if you don't like blood and guts I don't recommend watching it), had a good plot, lots of action and on the edge nail biting intensity.   <br /> <br />Jigsaw is on his deathbed and has his crazy assistant, Amanda, kidnap a doctor to help him with his illness but of course in Jigsaw fashion, there is a catch.  He also has her kidnap a man whose child had been accidentally run over by a driver and the driver was let off with a short sentence, which the father believes was not long enough for the crime.   The father has been living in a state of revenge and Jigsaw gives him the opportunity to fulfill his fantasies.   All of the characters weave together perfectly and at the end of the movie, all is explained.  The end of the movie is a perfect lead into the next sequel.  There are lots of twists and turns with the plot but all are believable.  If you like these kinds of gore movies, I highly recommend it.     <br />
B0000CC5CS|5.0|I was just noticing in my Bible study from Genesis on the Tower of Babel how man's technology had become threatening to God, so God divided the languages of men from one voice into many tongues so that they had to stop work on the tower. I was just thinking when God might send our technologically advanced society into darkness as well! In this movie, of course, the computers controlling society go haywire and plunge America into nuclear armageddon!<br /><br />That pretty blonde woman terminator that Arnold is trying to kill is more advanced than he; she takes a licking but keeps on ticking! I am sure that the cause of women's rights might think that this movie actually encourages domestic violence! Can you believe that Arnold Scharzeneggar once a guest star on Robert Schuler's HOUR OF POWER!<br /><br />Since I wait for the end of the world due to nuclear armageddon, I think there is a certain romance of having the hand of a pretty young woman to hold as you wait out DOOMSDAY in safety of a bomb shelter designed for politicians! I would say that at the air force command center in the movie that I thought I recognized a supercollding cyclotron as a long tube there in the tunnel that the young people fled though. I had seen one once at Michigan State University in a guided tour in 1984.
B00003CXAA|2.0|A truly great trilogy of movies (particularly the first two), reproduced in a manner that makes them almost unwatchable. Many times the actors are completely indistinguishable. This was a rotten thing to do to these movies.
1932100660|5.0|The eye opening, frightening, and thought provoking evidence set forth in this well written and thoroughly researched book should cause each of its readers to reevaluate their lives and lifestyles.  Dr. Campbell's tome is the \\"new\\" paradigm for all of us raised on a Western diet of meat, fat, sugar, and processed wheat.  A wake-up call that does not mask how difficult changing our lifestyles might be, but our lives literally depend upon a radical change. <br /> <br />I am not a physician or a scientist, so as a layperson reading this book I can attest that it has generated dramatic changes in my life; changes which I hope to maintain for a healthier second half of life.  Read it and live.  Pass the soy!
0345457692|3.0|I enjoyed this book, and am something of a sci-fi snob; I usually stick with P.K. Dick, William Gibson, or Neal Stephenson. If you like those authors, you will probably enjoy Altered Carbon. But at over 500 pages, I found at times my attention wavered. This book could have been a true sci-fi classic if the writer had shaved it down to 300 or so pages. There are many plot digressions that have little impact on the story.
B000L22WTO|4.0|Released as a tribute to his departed friend, David Gilmour's \\"Arnold Layne\\" features two performances of the title track (composed by the late Syd Barrett) and one of Barrett's \\"Dark Globe\\".  The former comes in a full band arrangement, the latter in a solo acoustic guitar performance reminiscent of the original. <br /> <br />The takes of \\"Arnold Layne\\" are mostly distinguished by their vocalist, with David Bowie singing the first and Richard Wright the second.  The band's performance is stunningly tight, maybe a bit too much for my taste.  Barrett's genius was his inventiveness and his unerring pop hooks, not his performances, and it seems like this gets forgotten.  Nonetheless, both versions prove to be decent performances-- I give Bowie's the edge simply because he captures the very British aspect of Barrett's music better than Wright does on the vocal. <br /> <br />The gem on the recording is Gilmour's \\"Dark Globe\\"-- his band may be too good to pull it off, but Gilmour sheds his technical expertise and embraces both the jagged rhythms of the piece and makes no effort to hide his own limitations as a vocalist.  It's perfect, gut wrenching in a way different from the original but equally powerful. <br /> <br />Truthfully, I've pretty much lost interest in Gilmour's works-- as far as I'm concerned, Pink Floyd's done little relevent in quite a long time and Gilmour's solo career has lacked interesting material, but with Barrett's quirky edge being among my favorites in music, I couldn't resist this, and while it's got its problems, I'm glad I got it, even if only for \\"Dark Globe\\".
B00005JLEU|5.0|Complex film.  Beautifully done, funny and intriging.  Study up on Japanese culture to fully appreciate.  Even if you don't it is excellent.
B000A88EV4|5.0|I first rented this movie not knowing really what to expect.  I had heard from a friend of mine overseas that this was a wonderful movie, something I just had to see.  I had fallen in love with Thewlis's performance as Remus Lupin and just needed to see more that he had been in.  At this point I had already watched some other movies with him in impressive roles, namely Gangster No. 1, Black Beauty and Total Eclipse, which I thought were all wonderful  Then I finally watched Naked and I was blown away! <br /> <br />His Johnny is not a nice man, not by any sense of the word.  He is rude, demeaning, cocky, and doesn't care a lick about anyone, including himself I am sure.  But he is also intelligent and funny in a sort of sadistic way, and I found that I could not help identifying with this character.  What a brilliant piece of art and look at humanity this film is, kudos to Mike Leigh for making such a rough and tumble look at the darker side of things.   <br /> <br />My husband recently bought me the Criterion Collection Naked and I even got him to watch, and later admit to enjoying, the movie.  I would comment on my favorite parts, but there are too many to point out.  Every supporting actor in this really makes each scene different and each has its own feel and chemistry between the actors.  All involved did a wonderful job.   <br /> <br />Oh and to the Remus Lupin fans (which I am of course, fangirl to the end!), there is a joke in there about werewolves that is pretty funny, given that he made this movie years before Azkaban. :) <br /> <br />
B000IJ79WU|5.0|This is an important DVD to own not only for Superman fans, but for anyone interested in filmmaking in general.  I grew up with the original Superman films, so they are well-established in my consciousness.  On this DVD, I first watched the documentary, then I watched the movie with the voice-over commentary, and then I watched the film as a whole.  I suggest that you use this method for viewing this film.   <br /> <br />Whatever you do, YOU MUST LISTEN TO THE COMMENTARY.  It is a wonderful lesson in filmmaking.  Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz explain each scene and the differences between the film as originally conceived and the way it actually turned out.  Richard Donner REALLY doesn't like Richard Lester - he says he couldn't make it through his version of Superman II.  Listening to Donner's comments, I tend to agree with his choices more than Lester's.   <br /> <br />The thing that hurt Lester's Superman II the most was the absence of Marlon Brando.  Even as a kid, I knew leaving him out of the film was completely bogus.  What I didn't know was that Brando had already filmed his part, which has now been fully restored.  It is a great improvement.  The first two Superman films were conceived as one long movie and filmed contemporaneously.  If Donner had been allowed to film the sequel, that's how it would have felt. <br /> <br />Now, \\"The Richard Donner Cut\\" isn't perfect.  How could it be?  It was pasted together from whatever was available.  There is the famous screen-test inserted into the movie in place of the actual scene.  This is very jarring but Donner felt it was the most important scene in both movies (the reason he used it as the screen-test) which is why he had to include it.  He was even forced to use some Lester footage.  As a result, the movie has an unfinished feel to it.  A lot of the special effects are very rough.  At least now, the true version of Superman II can exist in our minds. <br />
014028009X|1.0|I bought this book because I'd heard so much about it and I simply couldn't wait to start reading it. However, after the first few pages, already, I started to wonder what all the fuss about this book was about?! I made myself read on, only to finally put this book aside after having \\"worked\\" my way 2/3rds through it. How could such nonsense with its shallow level of jokes/humor possibly make it to a #1 New York bestseller? It completely beats me!!! (I am reading A LOT (am a book worm), have almost never before NOT finished a book!)
B0000C7PQK|4.0|This Engima CD 'Voyageur' is very enjoyable - melodic and hypnotic, as is their custom.  The only thing I didn't care for as much was the male voice on some of the songs, as it made the song not as soothing as it could have been.
0446528056|3.0|I LOVE Nicholas Sparks.  This book was well written and did not bore me as other readers had said.  I think that if I hadnt had high expectations, I would have enjoyed this book much more.  The ending leaves something to be desired, but is a good contrast to the themes of his other books.
B0002M6QLS|3.0|1st part - 3 stars<br /><br />2nd part - 4 stars<br /><br />3rd part - 5 stars<br /><br />There is very special feature in Hollywood: if first part of the film is great, then sequel is worse and if there is 3rd part of film - then it's usually crap (for example, Matrix, Final Destination and think there're more examples).<br /><br />This movie is absolutely opposite. First part seems ok, second is better (would even say much better), third part is wonderfull. Jokes are less flat and more intresting.<br /><br />But still first part is very nice and good to watch. Nice start for great movie.
1400049628|4.0|There are plenty books that may help you survive extreme situations, such as plane accidents, 3th world revolutions or atomic wars. <br />But we all know that the chances that something like that happens are remote... But a Zombie outbreak is something completly diferent: its happening all the time, in near places, without you even knowing it. <br />So dont be carefree and foolish: protect your loveones against the hordes of undead. <br /> <br />Use your head: cut theirs!
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Very well written CD but you need to be in a very mellow mood to listen to it.  The instrumental songs are great and the guitar work at the end of \\"The Blue\\" is awesome.  There is a cool bluesy sound in \\"This Heaven\\".  I always thought that one of the downfalls of About Face was that as soon as the guitar started jamming the song would fade out.  He doesn't short change you on this CD, but it is something you listen to when you want to really relax.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|This is probably the most sraight up cd I've ever bought. It makes cry and feel stronger at the same time! It gives you courage to be different, and to be someone you really want top be.The booklet that cam inside it is really inspirational.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is possibly their best work to date.  I didn't think it was possible to write music better than their last two CDs.  They give you a ton of music with great guitar & bass.  If you liked their last two Cds you will love this one.  I am not a fan of their early stuff so if you like the early stuff this may not be for you.
0385338694|5.0|I love Kinsella's books.  This book was fantastic and I could not put it down.  I was actually upset when I finished it because I really loved the characters and enjoyed the story.  Her Shopaholic series is wondderful as well.  It is on my list of must-reads.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|When a friend told me to go and watch Al Gore's documentary about global warming I thought... \\"what is the point, he is one more of those politicians\\". I must confess that if only 50% of what the video shows is true is still shocking (sadly, I believe that basically everything is correct). I am still surprised to find educated people that believe we humans cannot be responsible for the global warming problem. I hope this video helps many people to understand what the situation is, and to realize how close we are in decades to a possible massive disaster if we do not shift the use of technology to something different than oil and charcoal.  <br />I wish Al Gore had pointed more consistently, in addition, that the human population cannot keep incresing at the present rate because that factor is strictly connected with the amount of damage we are making to the environment and the chances of keeping the Earth livable for future genrations.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|The long-awaited DVD release of Sergeant York is worth the wait--as trying as it was--as well as every penny you spend on it. The film has been very nicely mastered for DVD and the special features are unusually plentiful for a film this old.<br /><br />Picture quality: Excellent transfer. Contrast, brightness, and sharpness are very good. The cinematography looks great and, in some scenes, almost modern thanks to this transfer.<br /><br />Sound quality: The sound was really amazing, too. The 1940s sound effects don't sound dated at all, and are particularly impressive during the climactic battle sequence.<br /><br />The special features are also good, but the film itself is, of course, the primary focus here. Overall, a quality DVD package for a very, very good movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 6 year old recieved this for Christmas and loves it!! The three of us (mom,dad, and son) love to play together. When I watch my son play, it is almost like I can see the wheeles turning in his head. <br />

0060899190|4.0|My 14 year old daughter really wanted this book (it was at the top of her list and if she didn't get it she was going to buy it herself. After viewing it I didn't feel right purchasing it for her, but when her older brother wanted a unique gift for her, I thought it was OK for him to purchase it.  I have read some of the excerpts with her, that I thought questionable, and the bottom line is she understands what is already known to her and if it doesn't make sense, she just moves on to the next postcard or asks for clarification.  In a way, it has opened opportunities for some very good discussions. My daughter has read some very adult material, so I am comfortable with her reading this book, but I would say that you need to carefully assess your own child's ability to handle the material presented before purchasing this book.  My daughter absolutely loves this book.  She reads 5-10 pages at most in one sitting....sometimes fewer if it is one of the puzzles or requires more thought.
1881273156|5.0|Have you ever had one of those books on your reading list for ages that somehow always seemed to get pushed to the bottom of the pile to make way for some other more urgent subject matter? Then when the book finally does struggle up the ladder to the top of your list, you feel like a complete fool for reading countless volumes of fluff when you could have, and should have, been reading a masterpiece! Such is the case with THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES by Gary Chapman. I've had this book on my shelves for so long, I don't even remember buying it.<br /><br />Dr. Chapman simplifies the complexities of expressing love to your spouse (and later in the book, to your children) into five categories (or languages) of love. What he says here is remarkably simplistic in its' design, yet obviously dynamically powerful in its' end results. As I read these pages, I had so many lights coming on in my head I thought I would trip the breaker!<br /><br />I've read dozens of books on building, maintaining and repairing marriages and some of them are laden with superb textual content that will certainly build strong marriages, and I cannot say this book is the best I've read on the subject, but it is certainly the most understandable and has the easiest degree of applicability that any couple will be able to utilize it's principles. You'll learn a lot about yourself and how to better express your love; but more importantly, you'll learn a lot about your mate and how they want you to express your love to them.<br /><br />In the closing pages of this book, Dr. Chapman states that his ultimate goal for writing this book is to eliminate the alarming high divorce rate we face today. If every married couple would read this book, his dream could very well be a reality. There is no longer an excuse to flounder around in a marriage of misery! Read this book and use it!<br /><br />Pastor Monty Rainey
B0000630YA|5.0|This is just a classic album. This was Alice's first \\"solo\\" project without his original Alice Cooper group (who went on to for the billion dollar babies).  Alice was nervous about this one when it was release, but its the one that solidified him as a rock legend.  Vincint price doing an intro to Black widow, who else could pull that off but Alice. And who else would dare venture into the teritory of necrophelia...alice cooper (cold Ethyl).  And the classic Stephen, I love that song, mental healthcare run wild.  A very shocking album at the time, but a classic which many tried to copy, but never can achieve. THis edition contains 3 bonus tracks as well, nice little editions for the dollar.
B000I2IT44|4.0|Before this DVD, I had never witnessed Porcupine Tree live in any capacity, even though I had been listening to them since the release of 2002's \\"In Absentia.\\"  <br />The experience captured on this DVD is almost exactly what I pictured a PT concert to be, and if you're a fan of their music -- especially their later catalogue -- then it is a must have.  <br />There are only two things I can honestly complain about with this DVD set, the first being that the song \\"Deadwing\\" from the album of the same name was omitted. From what I understand, they played this song as part of the setlist for the tour, and I really wish it was included. It's some of their finest work and the ideal opening track for a show.  <br />The other thing I noticed is that a few of the songs sounded somewhat thin or bare when compared with the studio versions. This could probably be attributed to the fact that Steven Wilson does so much of the instrumentation in the studio on his own. Unless he grew another pair of arms, or hired a ridiculously large band, it would be impossible to reproduce every single guitar track or keyboard blip captured on the albums.  <br />Overall, it's a fairly minor issue. The sound is great, the setlist is good, and there is no excuse not to own this if you are at all interested in the music.   <br />
0740748475|5.0|I bought this set of books for my 12 year old son who is an avid reader of Calvin and Hobbes. I also enjoy that little rascal and his tiger. These books come in a nice slide out case. The books are heavy and well made. These books will be great for passing down for generations because they are so well put together. And of course the comics are nothing but funny!
B000008LOV|5.0|The \\"Wilburys\\" is a pretty amazing group.  Their talent goes without saying, but what you may not have realized is that the group really does sound like they are having a lot of fun while they're working together.  This is definitely an excellent CD to purchase at whatever price.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|To act funny is not easy, and an actor like Schenk knows that. Although originally an actor, Otto Schenk has directed many operas at the Met and elsewhere. This DVD of L'Elisir D'amore, from the Vienna State Opera, directed by Schenk is a masterpiece. You have to watch this DVD several times to appreciate his work. I've never seen a chorus really acting, besides bodies being moved around. The various and different expressions and nuances on the choristers' faces are an intimate part of this production. It takes discipline, patience, leadership, and artistic inspirational insight for any director to accomplish that. The physicality and theatricality of this production, thanks to Schenk's genius, is phenomanal and it shows what opera buffa is all about. With so much action going on, on stage, it's amazing that the charaters not only can act with precision but also can sing without sliding or losing pitch contol. At times, it's difficult to comprehend it, and you may think that the voices are dubbed! Well, what about the quality of singing? L'Elisir D'amore is not a play but an opera after all.  I was fortunate, in the early 70s, to see L'Elisir at the Lyric Opera in Chicago with Pavarotti and Blegen. Pavarotti, the best bel canto tenor in our lifetime, vocally was phenomenal. A purist, that's all he cares about: the voice! In this DVD, the paradigm shift that Netrebko and Villazon have brought to the opera world today is confirmed one more time. Netrebko (Adina) is not only a formidable soprano but also a formidable actress. Villazon (Nemorino) is not only a tenor with an unbelievable clarion but also a great actor. The combination of singing and acting, as this DVD shows, have made Netrebko and Villazon the opera darlings of our time. Since Callas and Gobbi- voice notwithstanding- we have not seen opera singers with the acting capability of Netrebko and Villazon. One reviewer remarked that Villazon is overacting. What do you expect? He is the village idiot who has the hots for the beauty-queen of the village, and who also gets drunk! He's in character to the limit and you feel sorry for him. Nucci (Balcore) may have passed his vocal prime, but he still sings and acts well. D'Arcangelo (Dulcamara) vocally is excellent, and he moves on stage impessively and convincingly. Besides acting, the chorus sings gloriously with control, and adds color and vitality to the village's carefree life. The orchestra is well conducted and compliments Donizzeti's playful and joyous score admirably. Although, acoustically, there is some imbalance between the lead singers and the orchestra, this DVD is a gem and is highly recommended.    Constantine A. Papas  El Paso, Texas
0307346609|5.0|I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, and oddly enough I discounted this book for a long time.  When I eventually picked it up I was incredibly surprised.  This book has to be one of the most riviting books I have ever read.  It may seem cliche, but I was literally unable to put this book down.<br /><br />Brooks has managed to write a sweeping panoramic story not just about zombies, but about humanity.  By using the innovative method of transcribed interviews he evokes a gritty realism that brings you right into the story.  I had no problems believing his premise, in fact it was hard to shake this book off at time.  Brooks doesn't pull his punches prose-wise, and there are scenes here that have seared themselves onto my brain for the rest of my life.  He has also done his homework.  I can't vouch for the realism in many of his interviews, but I can tell you as an Army veteran the scenes of the military battling the zombies were exceeedingly well done, right down to the gaffes and stupidity that would more than likely occur during the initial onslaught.<br /><br />By using the trope of zombie infestation Brooks skillfully lampoons the military, celebrities, prescription drug companies, Middle Eastern countries, and a host of others.  He doesn't spare many from his biting prose, but yet there is a Studs Terkel-like feel as humanity shakes off its blundering stupidity and finds its inner strength.  Brooks makes a case for the next generation being able to become the next Greatest Generation.  In the end what is important is humanity's will to survive despite the horrors confronting it.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this book, but I also highly reccomend that you read it during the day with the doors locked.

B000JBXXZ4|3.0|This album is a step back from A Crow Left Of The Murder.  Nor horrible but not great either.  Despite the averageness of it, \\"Dig\\" is one of the best songs I've heard from Incubus.  If only the rest of the album was this good.
630469654X|5.0|A fantasy, dealing with the curse of star-crossed lovers, Ladyhawke never fail to be top-notch entertainment. The cast is exceptional, and get their characters right. It's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what's going on. <br /> <br />Along with \\"Dragonslayer\\", this is one of the top fantasy movies. The story is compelling, the setting has a very gritty, dirty feel to it, and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages. <br /> <br />This is not a movie I can just put on 'in the background' and let play while doing other things, because it suck me in every time.
B000J103PC|4.0|Tremendous to see Meryl Streep in a role where she can command the screen utterly. Her character, Miranda Priestly, will remind everyone of the worst female boss they ever had -- AND the fact that a demanding boss can sometimes prove that you can do the impossible.  Priestly is the kind of tyrant that one finds at the top of super-successful institutions -- crazy, but inarguably driven to seek excellence that others don't care about.<br /><br />And those of us who agree with Adam Ant that, \\"I don't follow fashion ... that'd be a joke,\\" will have new appreciation for this industry's demands. Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs grows from a Plain Jane to a beauty while working at Runway magazine -- and learns a lot about her own capabilities. While the superficiality and excess of the fashion world is obvious, there is a kernel of value to the fashionistas' attitude that beauty is worth seeking.
B000F1IQN2|2.0|I was expecting *Munich* to be a high action film and it wasn't.  Instead, I learned a thing or two about the sad tragedy of a bloodshed in Munich in 1972.  However, *Munich* was just simply too long to maintain my interest.<br /><br />It's 1972.  Munich is hosting the Olympics.  One evening, Palestinian terrorists have captured the 11 Israeli athlectics and murdered them.  This has come to be known as Black September.<br /><br />Shortly afterwards, the Israelis have decided on vengeance.  Anver and his team of men have been stripped of their identities and sent off on missions to assassinate those involved in the Black September massacre.  These men are not professionals in assassinations and weaponry.  However, they learned and improvised quickly to succeed in their missions.<br /><br />For someone not well versed in history of tension between Israel, Palestine and Arabic countries might assume that this what started the whole thing.  No additional information is provided these tensions.  So, the whole thing seems to be \\"out of the blue\\".  Perhaps, it was.<br /><br />Nonetheless, *Munich* is a long movie.  A long movie about vengeance with mission planning.  These missions are nothing \\"high action\\" like Mission Impossible.  They're simply and to the point.<br /><br />Maybe you'll like this type of historical movies, dealing with terrorism of the past.  For me, this was something that I could've been satisfied with an hour-long documentary on PBS or the History Channel.  Nothing in this film truly captured my attention.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is the album that brought Dream Theater to the masses and firmly established them at the top of the prog rock heap.  In fact by 1992 when this album came out progressive rock was all but dead in the U.S.  The fact that the single from this album \\"Pull Me Under\\" received any airplay at all was rather remarkable for the time period.  The album is a true classic without a weak track on it.  Charlie Dominici is replaced by James Labrie on vocals and there is no contest as to which one is the better singer.  \\"Pull Me Under\\" starts of the album with a bang, listening to it again after all these years it still pulls me in and I find myself banging my head along with the chugging intro.  The centerpiece of this album is the almost 10 minute \\"Metropolis Part 1\\".  This has long been a fan favorite and a staple of the band's live shows.  The song is actually only an excerpt from a longer work that would be released as the album \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" a decade later.  The song is all that makes Dream Theater great, extreme complex prog metal instrumental interplay, intelligent well thought out lyrics, soaring vocals.  The rest of the album is also very strong.  \\"Another Day\\", \\"Take The Time\\", \\"Surrounded\\", \\"Under A Glass Moon\\", \\"Wait For Sleep\\" and the epic album closer \\"Learning To Live\\" are all eloquently crafted and performed.  If a nutshell this album is about as good as melodic progressive metal gets.

Keep them from advancing upon your territory in the name of defense. <br /> <br />Heck, this movie at times was so random, I am surprised that Brom didnt pull out twin M9 Service Pistols (Beretta) and start laying waste to everything around him. <br /> <br />What was with the dragon suddenly growing?!??!?!?!?!??! <br /> <br />This movie has in a way, more than one, but is not completely void of, using the similarities of the accounted, already released and famed, movie films based upon the following but not limited to, movies of Star Wars by G.Lucas and Lord of the Rings by Tolken and is hereby charged with by may not be deemable by others, an official 1 star rating based upon the fractional numbers of 1/90th improvence on: Actors Acting and the other 89/90 being, but not secluded to, the special effects on Saphira, the dragon. <br />
B000002R48|4.0|This is the debut album from the band that would go on to become arguably the most successful heavy progressive bands in history.  Although they may not have invented prog metal, they were certainly pioneers in advancing the genre.  This is the only album to feature original vocalist Charlie Dominici who would be replaced after this album by James Labrie.  Keys man Kevin Moore is also on this disc, but would eventually leave.  The rest of the lineup remains the same as today with John Petrucci on guitar, Mike Portnoy on drums, and John Myung on bass.  Most, if not all, of the members of Dream Theater were graduates of the Berklee College of music in Boston.  Every member of this band past and present have been virtuosos on their respective instruments.  I personally consider this the band's weakest album, but there is still much here to enjoy.  The all instrumental \\"Ytse Jam\\" is outstanding and a track they still pull out live now and then to this day.  \\"The Killing Hand\\", \\"Fortune In Lies\\" and \\"The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun\\" are all great too.  The vocals on this album are certainly different from the latter stuff with Labrie.  Dominici has a decent voice, but is not at the same level as his instrumental compadres.   The music at times delves into 80's hair metal territory and also appears to have a definite Rush and especially Queensryche influence.  The production on the album is another issue.  I have the re-mastered version where things have been cleaned up quite a bit, but the original version' sound was quite muddy.  This is not an album for starters with Dream Theater, but for the completest it is a nice addition to their catalogue.
0743289412|3.0|The title of this review indicates my first (and worst) problem with \\"Lisey's Story\\": the constant repetition of phrases the Landon's used in the \\"private language of marriage.\\" (The fact that many such expressions seem to have come from his bad ole daddy doesn't seem to have kept Scott Landon from using them ad nauseum.) More important, the book is boring. A thriller should not be dull. It can (and should) have lulls, of course, so the next time someone jumps out and yells \\"Boo!\\" the reader is startled, but here, the novel comes to a dead halt in places. The action does pick up in the last third of the story but the climax comes long before the drawn-out end. I did like the acknowledgement page; however, I don't think he has \\"the sister thing\\" quite right, at least not until \\"big sissa Mandy bunny--now 59 years old--asks her 49-year-old sister Lisey to \\"drop the Mandy bunny\\" stuff. Only for diehard King fans; others, read Peter Straub instead.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think this series is awesome...I never watched the series before but while on a trip to Seattle I had the chance to view the entire series as well as the movie Serenity, which is based on the series, Firefly. I just had to have it in my collection. I've become hooked on the show, and as such, my son-in-law-to-be calls me a true \\"browncoat\\". I definitely recommend this series to everyone. Truly funny and engaging show, with alot of edge of your seat action!
B000001EC1|4.0|I have soft spots for a lot of these songs; during my radio days, a rocking Bon Jovi single was good for a lift during the airshift. Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Samboro were always good for a rock-candy riff amid the other pop tunes. The ersatz Springsteen may have been cannon fodder for critics and snobs who'd insist that the band wasn't 'rock' enough, but \\"Living On A Prayer\\" and \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" were meaty shout-outs for car-radio cruising.<br /><br />Which is why \\"Crossroad\\" is such a great Bon Jovi record. The albums were always fair to average, but the singles were mega-shots of energy. Even the melodramatic ballads could convey the angst of blue-collar relationships. \\"Always\\" is romantic, \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" outlaw mythology. I often get irritated by those who accuse hit-makers of being \\"corporate;\\" there is a skill and a knack to being a good songwriter. It means people pay attention to your songs and take them to heart.<br /><br />Therein lies the rub. Bon Jovi took a lot of flack for some of these songs. But he (and the band that bears his name) have outlasted many of the 'important' artists that came and vanished with little or no consequence. \\"Crossroad\\" contains several rock classics, and that alone is enough to give it four stars. (But it is due for an update...)
020161622X|3.0|Pros: well written, 100% valuable pragmatics, great analogies (comparing programming with gardening), useful, pleasant exercises, with well explained solutions.   Cons: Any serious developer going through a couple of serious projects already knows most of this. In that sense I see this book more as a tutorial for the \\"rookie\\" (pragmatic) programmer. And when it comes to design rules and pragmatics I found much more solid, universal and valuable: \\"The Art of Unix Programming\\" by Eric Steven Raymond, amazingly enough available on-line at: [...]
0812932293|5.0|Very interesting. His life story, told by Richard Branson gave me a new perspective.
B0000B0WVQ|3.0|I heard \\"the Valley\\" and loved it. The rest of the CD is nothing like the valley- but I still enjoy the songs.  Reminds me a little of elastica.  I put this on my harddrive and mixed it in with some other punky stuff- nice to have female voices in there too.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I ordered the Wicked soundtrack after seeing the live show.  Both are wonderful!  The songs are catchy and expand the narrative well.  An almost perfect complement to the book--not the same, of course, but it holds well to the themes of friendship, justice, and the nature of evil.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Lost in Translation stars Bill Murray as Bob Harris, a middle-aged American actor in Tokyo for a week to shoot commercials for a brand of whiskey sold in Japan.  The film also stars Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, the American wife of an American photographer who has tagged along with her husband on his business trip to Tokyo.  Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this movie and it was beautifully filmed by Lance Acord. <br /> <br />The film is about two people in a alien culture connecting in a way that they would never have connected back in the States.  If you've ever been to Asia on a business trip, this film captures perfectly the overwhelming off-kilter sense that an American feels in large Asian cities.  Superficially, they are made out of the same elements, concrete, bricks, glass, pavement, and the structures are similar, tall buildings, streets, sidewalks, cars.  But everything is just slightly different and some things are enormously different.  I had to laugh when Bill Murray came out of the hotel and onto the street and saw a van driving down the street with two Japanese women dressed like Jackie Onasis waving to onlookers as another woman exhorted the crowds in Japanese over a loudspeaker.  I've seen similar things myself in Taiwan and probably had the same confused expression on my face as Bill Murray did.  When you are immersed in a different culture, you can often run across things that are just baffling.  Sofia Coppola captures that feeling perfectly. <br /> <br />And it's in this strange world that Bob meets Charlotte.  Both married, but both bored and somewhat overwhelmed by their surroundings.  In America, they'd hardly glance at each other, because Bob is 20 years older than Charlotte, and they really have very little in common.  But in Tokyo, compared to everyone else they run across, they have a lot in common.  So they connect, they talk, they start hanging out together, they explore a little of Tokyo together.  And at the end of the movie, Bobflies back to the States, and Charlotte awaits her husband's return from a two day side trip to Kyoto.  Both of them gained a lot from the experience and both of them have changed, for the better.  Kind of a bittersweet ending because you get the feeling they'll never see each other again. <br /> <br />This is really a wonderful, engrossing film though.  It is marvelously well written and directed.  Bill Murray is perfect as the slightly bewildered American in the strange world of Tokyo advertising.  Scarlett Johansson is extraordinary as the twenty-something young wife with a philosophy degree wondering about her future.  The rest of the cast fills in the edges well, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. <br /> <br />Really well worth the price of admission.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Ever since \\"The Love Bug,\\" people have been fascinated with wonder on the possibility that perhaps all the love and attention they give to their cars could be reciprocated by their cars!  \\"Herbie\\" was the underdog Love Bug.  Christine however is the jealous bitch-car!<br /><br />In my early 20's I-like many other young men-found and restored my own special \\"Love-Car\\"- a 1968 AMC Javelin, painted the same colors as Christine!  My customized licence plates told the story of my obsession and love for that car for all to see!  \\"HOLY J\\"  :)  But however, the \\"Holy J\\" was after all, just a car to party in with the gang and wreck all the time. In the end, 'Holy J' meant to me that I \\"resurrected\\" the car dozens of times after the results of drunken road trips!  It never had a vengeful bolt on it's chassis, as Christine did!<br /><br />Take a classic nerd.  Add the rusted wreck of a 1958 Plymouth Belvedere. (That was a Beledere, not a Fury.)  A gorgeous Belvedere with an attitude!  What do you end up with?  A lot of magic.  A lot of unswerving devotion. A lot of vengeance!  And a lot of guts in more ways than one!  And unlike my Javelin, Christine had the ability and talent to FIX HERSELF after being trashed by hoods, and after trashing herself in her many murderous sprees in revenge of those who f(ool)ed with her!<br /><br />I read the book after seeing the movie long ago.  I was disappointed in the book, it got boring in many places, whereas the movie stuck to the main star, Christine!  There was no need to show rotting corpses in the back seat to convey the sheer EVIL under her hood!<br /><br />My favorite scene:  After Arnie's girl chokes on the hamburger in Christine, he drives her home.  Upon returning to the car, Christine won't start.  Arnie tries to sweettalk Christine to no avail!  Only when Arnie tells Christine that nothing has changed in THEIR love affair does Christine respond with a deep motor roll, and the radio plays \\"I wonder why I love you like I do!\\"  And Arnie smiles the most chilling adoration smile you ever seen!  Its the smile a teen has after his first sexual encounter!  That smile alone speaks volumes!<br /><br />I would love to see a 2007 remake of Christine!  Call it Christine-Resurrection.  Show the cube of crushed metal of the old Christine melted into a ceiling beam in a factory that collapses, killing dozens. Then show the twisted girder once again melted down and sent to Detroit to form the body of the new Christine:  A gorgeous 2006 Chrysler 300C Touring Sedan...WITH A VENGEANCE!  Just waiting for the future nerd to come along to fall in fatal love with \\"her!\\"<br /><br />(PS: To see the real upcoming resurrection of a \\"Christine,\\" go to [...]and feast your eyes on the entombed '57 Belvedere to be dug up this June!)d Arnie smiles the most chilling adoration smile you ever seen!

1582701709|5.0|The secret is just that, a secret that has been kept a secret for years and years, only to be passed on by people that knew the secret.  It was an elite group until now.  You have the potential within to do anything you want but you need to know \\"The Secret\\".  Read the book and watch the DVD and you will not be disappointed!  IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND HOW YOU VIEW EVERYTHING FROM NOW ON!
B000B5XOYI|4.0|While I did not like all of the BATMAN movies especially the campy TV one. I found some of them interesting in how different actors approached the project. I was given a gift card for Xmas and I felt it was worth the money I did not spend personally. Holy Arnold Batman now he is The Govenator.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I am sure that I am in the wee 'minority' but even than I really can't understand the fuss about Daniel Craig and the movie itself. I found the movie Casino Royale boring and Daniel Craig never really came across as bond to me.<br /><br />In the movie Daniel Craig feels more like a physco henchman ala the lines of Robert Shaw\\"s 'Red Grant' than the heroic figure of Bond. We grew up with Sean Connery's bond who was sauve, sophisticated, lean & mean gentleman spy which set a bar for all the other actors playing Bond to follow. However, in Daniel Craig version of Bond he is this polar opposite figure who is a confused as well as brutish running around in speedos and messing up half of the stuff he touches. He appears to be missing the famous wit and intellect of the cinematic bond rather he is raw, unfocused and almost to a level of a remorseless thug who has somehow been recruited by the secret service(hint:reminds me of a another bond rip-off movie). Daniel Craig is convincing atleast in a sense that this is a bond that atleast 'I' never grew up liking. Hopefully in the next few movies he will flesh out the charismatic, sauve, gentleman super-spy Bond persona lot more than he currently potray's. Right now Daniel Craig's Casino Royale comes across more as a british version of the movie XxX rather than a bond movie.<br /><br />As far as the movie is concerned its dark, gloomy, boring, simplistic, disjointed and lacking on the fun escapism factor. Gone are most of the fun elements we used to associate with bond himself and the franchise too. The gadgets are about almost all gone and so are the quirky one-liners as wells the sophistication and the high-end production values which were the earmark of the bond movies. The action sequences though intense are excessively front-loaded. Around about half-time the movie runs out of steam and than we are subjected to boring phsyco-babble, way too long casino sequences and a love story that never really convinces. And than at the very end you have another short action piece(which kind of defies logic since this movie was supposed to be all 'real') culminating in Daniel Craig taking his first small step towards the iconic bond and thats about it.<br /><br />Well thats the end of my honest review........have another short action piece(which kind of defies logic since this movie was supposed to be all 'real') culminating in Daniel Craig taking his first small step towards the iconic bond and thats about it.    Well thats the end of my honest review........
B00003CX5P|4.0|I bought the VHS when this movie came out for home and while the packaging of that tape was nice.....It wasn't the quality that DVD can deliver. I am glad that I bought this disc.
B00004BZ16|5.0|OK, I can relate with people that say the Clash included a lot of filler in this album. Yes, there are some songs that are, well, they aren't even Clash songs. I mean, you got kids singing, you got Jamaicans singing, women singing, etc. And if you get caught up in some of these \\"different\\" songs, you start to take a negative view of the album. HOWEVER, let's keep something in mind. When this album was released, it was on three albums. However, it was priced the same as your typical double album. So in effect, you were getting triple the music for not much more. So, when you keep that in mind, you se that you are not being ripped off at all. You are just experiencing an extremely talented band having fun. They play rap, reggae, punk, ska, funk, etc. And if you don't like a song, just forward it, there are plenty to choose from. There are plenty of Clash staples here, like \\"Something About England,\\" \\"Somebody Got Murdered,\\" \\"Lets Go Crazy,\\" \\"Police on My Back,\\" \\"Charlie Don't Surf,\\" etc.. Yeah, \\"Lose this Skin\\" is a stretch, among others, but like I said, if you don't like it, forward it and keep in mind, for the price, you got a pretty nice deal just the same.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|When i heard that Martin was going to make this movie I couldnt wait for it to be released.  I went in the theater with high hopes a was not dissapointed. Dicaprio and Damon both put out kickass performances and you cant for get Jack is back. Best movie of 06 and deserves oscar for best picture and actors.
032147404X|3.0|This is basically a short book (one day read) that has quite a bit of useful information in it but, unfortunately, also contains lots of filler (should have been at most 1/2 the size).  It is also more geared toward a DSLR owner than the owner of a digital point and shoot which I happen to be.   <br /> <br />A newb, like myself, would be advised to look elswhere for a first book.  It would, however, make a decent second choice book particularly if you own a DSLR.  I read Amphoto's Guide to Digital Photography and preferred it.
B00004R99J|4.0|The Gold Collection disc is too flawed to seriously consider at this point with the \\"10th Anniversary{ two-disc set now out.  <br /> <br />Gold Collection: <br />1. Worst DVD tranfer of a Disney film in recent memory <br />2. No \\"If I Never Knew You\\". Not even the rough cut.  <br />3. Extras: a Trailer and some music videos. Not much going on here.  <br />4. Not anamorphic <br /> <br />10th Anniversary: <br />1. Anamorphic 16:9 <br />2. Great new transfer <br />3. \\"If I Never Knew You\\" in the movie and completely animated. Major addition to the last half of the movie. <br />4. Both versions of the film, the 1995 cut and the 2003 \\"Director's Cut\\".  <br />5. Loads of extras including a documentary, updated audio commentary track, sections for each major character with art, concept drawings, deleted scenes, scenes that never made it past the concept stage......you get the idea.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|I've loved the Chili Peppers ever since I was in 8th grade (I am now 29 years old), and it saddens me to say that this album was terrible. The last two albums (Californication; By the Way) since the return of John Frusciante have been beautiful, but I guess it now seems clear that they were building towards this cookie-cutter pop disaster. The Peppers seem to have left their integrity behind for this one, creating a radio-friendly collection without much merit. What's worse is that it's not only one, but two cd's of mind-numbing mediocrity. Save yourself some money and buy a Pearl Jam record.
B00004R99U|1.0|I am a hardcore fan of the original film and this cheap quickie to make some cash off the original was both misguided and awful. Terrible songs, terrible script.....ugh. Where to start? This may be the worst Disney sequel EVER and that is saying something! I am not going to tread the same ground about the story that has been covered 200 times already. Just avoid this at all costs. Please. Do if for the children. And if you love the original \\"Pocahontas\\", do it for yourself.
1591791707|5.0|Marshall Rosenberg has initiated peace programs in war ravaged areas around the world including Ireland, Serbia, Croatia, Rwanda and the Middle East.  He also gives workshops has worked in the prison systems and has applied his ideas with great success in a variety of settings.  His book that goes along with this audio series Nonviolent Communication was a textbook for one of my communication courses which was a requirement for a Masters in Integral Psychology.  In short, he is a highly credible author with a gift for simplifying complex topic down to simple models that could be applied easily in daily life.<br /><br />The basic model he uses allow a person to unravel the trigger for an emotion from the actual cause which is often unconscious thinking or beliefs.  For example, if I child didn't clean his room that is not necessarily the cause of the parent's anger.  The real cause is some underlying need for example that the parent is concerned about the child developing discipline or an examined assumption such as my child is ignoring what I asked them to do.  The point is that we often jump into action or go immediately to a negative emotion without much CONSCIOUS thought.  This four step process allows you to deepen your awareness so that when you are in situations that might automatically trigger you, you can chose more healthy options.<br /><br />Another aspect of the four step process is staying with emotions until one uncovers the underlying need.  Sometimes, this involves the emotion shifting to another one.  For example, say my partner gets angry because I didn't do the dishes.  Rather than just starting an argument, Rosenberg would advise my partner to stay with her emotion.  By being willing to fully feel the anger, she might realize in actuality that she feels hurt.  By staying with the hurt she may have the realization that her underlying need is actually to feel loved and that me doing the dishes is symbolic for her of loving her and being concerned.  With this additional awareness she is in a position to make a more vulnerable and powerful request that is likely to get her what she really wants.  For example, using the four part model she might say, \\"When you forget to do the dishes (observation), I feel hurt (feeling-notice there is no blame or shame) because I notice that I'm not feeling loved because I associate you following through on things like that with being concerned for me (the real need).  Now that you understand how I feel, would you be willing to be more vigilant about your agreements over everyday stuff because when you do it makes me feel like you care (request).<br /><br />Admittedly the model is simple, but it is also very powerful.  Most of us act without awareness much of the time.  In our time contrained culture, we also tend to dismiss feelings as sources of information about needs that are important to us.  This model helps you to get back in touch with the purpose of your emotion and your buried needs.  It will help you to increase the intimacy in all of your relationships, not to mention helping you to make requests that are more likely to get you the results you wanted in the first place.<br /><br />If you are serious about changing unhealthy communication patterns, I would also get the book to accompany this audio set.  Patterns of language and the thinking that accompanies them are deeply engrained.  In fact, there are often hidden assumptions in our automatic thinking such as OTHER people CAUSE our emotions.  We actually have a lot of degree of control over how we feel when someone does a particular behavior.  A lot of this depends upon how we \\"frame\\" or contextualize the behavior.  This book is very useful in helping you uncover these patterns and changing them.<br /><br />In my practice as personal growth coach I often recommend this book and audio CD to clients.  I've seen this information help a lot of people and it has helped me too.  If it helps you avoid even one argument withan important person in your life, it is well worth the cost.  I guarantee it will raise your awareness around your unconscious processes and help you to have healthier relationships if you apply the ideas faithfully.<br /><br />The CD on giving and receiving anger compassionately is especially good.  This is a problem area for a lot of people and I think this CD alone justifies the cost of the set.  Don't be deceived by Rosenberg's simple presentation of ideas.  It is often the most simple ideas that are the most powerful when applied in daily life.well worth the cost.  I guarantee it will raise your awareness around your unconscious processes and help you to have healthier relationships if you apply the ideas faithfully.

B000IKHNT8|3.0|Watching the original versions of the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD is like travelling back in time - not so much to the innocence of youth but more to the days when picture quality was never much of a consideration on video releases and Fox had the reputation for the worst transfers in the business. Watching these DVDs is to step back into an age of low resolution standards conversions with all the loss of detail and motion blurring that that entailed: certainly if you've got one of the old remastered video releases you might as well hold on to that, because the quality isn't as poor as this. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. From Lucas' past track record it's all too easy to imagine this is just a scam to allow him to sell a remastered version a couple of years down the line, but it's even harder to dispel the notion that somewhere Lucas is whining \\"See how soft the focus is? How can you say these are better films?\\"  <br /> <br />Although commonly blamed for the death of cinema as we knew it, in truth Star Wars was a huge breath of fresh air after the increasingly stale and formulaic week-in, week-out reality of woefully unimaginative and derivative downbeat on-the-cheap 70s cinema. It wasn't merely a matter of having a happy ending, more that there was a sense of panache and unapologetic adventure that had been missing for too long at the time (even the decade's best adventures, such as The Wind and the Lion and The Man Who Would Be King, saw their heroes destroyed by society in an age that had no place for them). Looking at it for the first time in years, its much better directed than remembered, extremely well constructed and beautifully designed, introducing the `future is old' concept that many would attribute to Ridley Scott. It also, unlike the prequels, has the saving grace of Han Solo, a character whose deprecating sense of humor undercuts the more solemn and potentially pretentious moments in a way that would be much missed amid the talk ofapprentices, trade embargoes and midi-chloridians in the prequels. It's still fun and it still works, even in the very worst transfer of the originals. <br /> <br />The Empire Strikes Back suffered the least in the special edition reworkings (although the clunky rewriting of the scene with the Emperor shows Lucas' leaden touch with dialog only too clearly) and as a transfer suffers the least of the original versions, but it's still not good enough. The film itself holds up surprisingly well, fully deserving its reputation as the best (and naturally least commercially successful) of the series. A lot of the credit has to go to co-writer Leigh Brackett, with the film's verbal sparring having a classic Hollywood feel to it that gives it a mixture of the best of both worlds, while keeping things moving at a brisk pace. Irvin Kershner's direction brings the best out of the cast too, while the action scenes - particularly the battle on the ice - are the best in the series. It's just a shame that the film's (genuinely unexpected at the time) cliffhanger was thrown away in the follow-up. <br /> <br />Return of the Jedi isn't as bad as the scarred memories of working at a movie theatre showing it five times a day for 12 weeks would have it, but it's still the least of the series. With no producer or studio to rein him in this time, Lucas offers something that's little more than a rehash of the first two films, but with bigger Death Stars, more spaceships, more teddy bears and far, far too many Muppets, it's crippled by an atrocious opening section where one after another the heroes try to rescue Han Solo only to get captured in the most tedious ways possible. Richard Marquand's inability to direct action is much to the fore in this section, and he's not much better in the rest of the film, while Harrison Ford gives a particularly bad performance that's all too indicative of a bored man with nothing to do but stuck here anyway because of contractual obligation. If you can forget the dire first third, the rest of the film is okay when it's dealing with the Skywalkers' family feuds but less successful on the ground in the Teddy Bears Picnic - sorry, Ewok scenes. Still, it does have Princess Leia in the slavegirl outfit... <br /> <br />The discs also include the revised special editions released a couple of years ago, which at least boast excellent picture and sound quality, though are all extras-lite with only a commentary and a Star Wars Lego promo.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is a good lyricist but to say that he is bringing hip hop back(especially when cornball groups like D4L and Dem Franchize Noize can make crappy albums and go gold)is a bit much. Kanye's production especially on this album is solid and innovative and not simplistic sounding like the beats you get from these overrated producers(think Nitti and Swizz Beatz). Standout tracks: ALL FALLS DOWN, SPACESHIP, JESUS WALKS, NEVER LET ME DOWN, GET EM HIGH(Kanye and Talib's verses were hot but Common steals the show), THE NEW WORKOUT PLAN, SCHOOL SPIRIT, TWO WORDS, THROUGH THE WIRE(crazy first single) and FAMILY BUSINESS. Filler: Breathe in Breathe out(corny snoozer alert), Slow Jamz(I never liked this track but to put and extended version is going overboard) and all those skits(while truthful) were not funny. Bottom line: Kanye West shows and proves on this highlight album of 2004. His flow is impressive, the production is great and the guest appearances shine along with him. A classic debut.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|A few months ago I was channel surfing when I stumbled across Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle. This movie is light years beyond awful. I believe it was the worst movie of 2003, the worst movie of the decade, the worst movie in the history of cinema.    Some Amazon vendors are selling used DVDs of this film for one penny, but even that price is far too high. The only good thing about this movie is that it would make an effective alternative to water boarding.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|I'm not even going to bother going over a synopsis of the plot. All you horror fans need to know is that this movie surpasses the first film, but in my opinion, it doesn't stand up to the second film in terms of suspense. Saw 3 is the goriest, most disturbing of the films. It seems like 2006 was the year of gore! First came Hostel, with it's torture and blood, then came The Hills Have Eyes, with it's rape, animal killings, parent killings and brutality, and now comes Saw 3...With it's flesh tearing, bone breaking, head twisting, gore splattered shock-fest. I have NEVER, in all my years of watching horror, had to actually cover my own ears and close my eyes while watching more than one scene in a movie before this one. The opening scene had me squirming in my seat with my lids tightly shut (after 15 seconds into the scene I had to mute the tv because I was so grossed out by the noises) and the scene involving a victim trapped in a device that \\"TWISTS\\" every limb on his body until the skin tears and the bones break made me want to literally vomit. But, still, the movie was very suspensful and horrifying. It kept you watching and interested. If you can stomach extreme gore and terror then you might enjoy this film. I have to admit that I REALLY hated the ending though. I can't even explain how upset it made me, but overall, the movie was very scary and disturbing. Better than the first, not as good as the second...give it a try...but do it on an empty stomach!!
B000002P86|4.0|First let me point out to my loyal \\"The King Of The World Blues Reviewer\\" fans: Obviously BB is an all-time icon, but he is not in my personal top 6 electric blues guitarists, nothing negative in that statement, he's just a little too sedate for me overall. Now, moving on to the review. Talk about the word \\"fun\\"! If you could use that anywhere, it is here! BB performs \\"duets\\" with everyone from Van Morrison, Tracy Chapman, Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, The Stones, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, and a few others. BUT! THE MOST FUN ONE OF ALL, THAT ME AND MY SON SHAQ JR. LOVED, WAS WITH THE RAPPER \\"HEAVY D\\"! They perform a rap/rock duet, where \\"Heavy D\\", talks about making a \\"move\\" on BB's sweetheart \\"Lucille\\"! I'm sure anyone reading this review knows who that fine lady is! This CD is a definite \\"buy\\" and can be enjoyed by all ages, and musical tastes!
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I never had HBO and couldn't bring myself to watch the episodes edited down for TV. I thought about going through the 20 discs one at a time on  Netflix but realized it would take me so many months that I would spend just about the same amount of money buying this set from Amazon. And I am so happy I did. I love this show, and I finally know why everyone was so upset when it was over. I finally caught up with the rest of the world.
B0009K7ROI|2.0|This CD is a total disappointment! After being impressed (Despite a voice showing age.) with his 70th Birthday CD (See previous Shaq review) I was excited when I saw this released. But this CD is really poor. The voice is about gone, and the lyrics range from ridiculous to absurd! A sample for \\"The King Of The World Blues Reviewer\\" fans: \\"Chaos in the neighborhood/our city park is a garden of misery/a sick population all beyond recovery/it's hard to be homeless.\\" Or \\"will your baggage/even make the flight/or will they lose them/somewhere in the night\\" LAST BUT NOT LEAST: \\"Get ready for the world and all the things we left behind/farewell Kona Village I'll be back some other time.\\"<br /><br />Shaq hopes Kona Village is a retirement community, where a blues singer should go to retire and live near the Seinfeld's! (Maybe John can run for President of the condo association!)
B00003CXSM|2.0|As most of the Revolution Studios movies, \\"The Wedding Planner\\" is not a conventional one. You won't find the classic leading lady with the classic leading guy in the classic romantic-and-predictable-as-usual story. And this stereotype-melting effort is probably what catches our attention. To see couples or situations you normally don't see due to social stereotypes and conventionalisms it is certainly a rather interesting exercise. Having said that, \\"The Wedding Planner\\" is also really fun movie to watch. Most characters are great (except perhaps Lopez' italian admirer who is plainly lame). And my other serious complaint is: what's with Matthew McConaughey's hair in this movie? It looks so dry and frizzy and so artifically colored! I think they could have afforded to give the leading guy a more stylish look. On the other hand, passing J. Lo as a italian gal is not very believable (I mean). But on the up and up, J. Lo's wardrobe and hairstyling are remarkably beautiful in this movie giving her a tidy, neat and classy look very distant from her usual flamboyant bombshell persona. Overall a nice entertaining light and funny romantic movie to watch.
B00000DF6O|4.0|To quote BB himself: \\"All live, all real. No overdubs, no high-tech tricks. JUST THE BASIC BLUES!\\" Shaq, \\"The King Of The World Blues Reviewer\\" says: \\"This is what I call mellow blues.\\" This is the kind of music you want on, when you want to relax. A rainy day in winter, open the curtains, put this CD on, sit back, and let BB gently, serenade you. There's no better way to end this review, than to quote the other \\"King\\" (BB) himself: \\"In case you're interested, my favorite is \\"I'll Survive,\\" a song I wrote back in the fifties. I sang it then, but I'm not sure I understood it .Now I know the meaning of survival.\\"
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This has got to be one of Gary Cooper's greatest roles. From everything I've read of Sgt York this is really authentic. Everyone will be inspired by watching this film of one of WW I greatest heros. His faith realy inspires me.
0385512058|5.0|This book was recommended to me by people helping me with a job search.  I would read a few pages and then put it down so offended by the self serving narcissicm of the story I could not read on.  After a few days I would pick it back up again and read some of the smartest and insightful information I've ever found.  I read to the point of Mr. Ferrazzi's divorce and I realizied that all of this information was useless if he could not maintain the one relationship that really mattered.  I put the book down for several weeks resolved not to read again,  he had lost credibility with me.  Then I began again and read idea after idea I used the very day I read them to enhance my job search and my relationships with people I interact with for business. Their is no doubt, my future is brighter because of reading this book.
0739334085|5.0|If you are curious about Barack Obama and whether he'd make a good President for this country -- or even curious about whether he's like 'all the other politicans' we have -- check this out...<br /><br />I thought I'd give it a chance and I have never been more moved or encouraged. If I could give this 20 stars I would.  This is an amazing, book that makes me hopeful and interested in our potential to improve our great country.<br /><br />No matter your politics, this type of practical leadership and common sense thinking is exactly what we need.

Awesome book.  Worth a read.  You'll feel encouraged and excited that someone out there actually has some common sense and interesting perspective on how to move things forward.<br /><br />I think the book is wonderful because he isn't taking sides and he agrees that Republicans and Democrats both have points and faults.  He points out some of his own party as well as others of course.

0920668372|1.0|I'm so surprised that people find this to be their favorite book!!!  I just read it after a long time on the shelf to my 6 year old, having forgotten how awful it was!!!! First of all, a mother doesn't pick up a sleeping baby or toddler because they might wake up.  No mother I know would crawl across her TEENAGE BOY'S FLOOR when he's sleeping and pick him up to rock him, nor would she DRIVE to her GROWN SON'S HOUSE in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, climb a LADDER to climb through his window and rock the grown man while he is sleeping!  Sick and weird!!!  It is some crazy codependent relationship.  There are plenty of books that express the beautiful unconditional love of a parent for a child, and this is not one of them.  I am always the first to cry and sentiment and sap, but this one made me feel physically ill.  Blech.
B00005JPGM|5.0|There arent many words I can say for the film...it was amazing, Brilliant, and stunning. Its amazing how to us diamonds represent our ideals of beauty, eternal love and romance and also the very harsh and violent cultural and economic conditions that produce some of them, something that for the most part Americans are blind to. Leonardo DiCaprio was breathtaking , and continues to produce astounding movies...see it...although heartbreaking it is a stellar movie
B000E41MS6|4.0|We found this show to absolutely be fantastic.  One of the most refreshing shows on TV today.  Bravo for BBC and Dr. Who.
B000068FWC|4.0|This is Supertramp's biggest-selling record, with the hits \\"Take the Long Way  Home\\" and \\"Logical Song\\".  Its a little less progressive than their earlier albums, and a little more focused.  Good instrumentation at times, with two keyboards, woodwinds, drums, bass, glockenspiel and didjarridoo.
B000002KO1|5.0|It defined an era, was an exceptionally tight band, and Chrissie is a punk goddess...Listening to this defines being 18 and falling in love for me. One of my top ten, stranded-on-an-island albums, and that's saying a lot...
B000FIHJLK|3.0|Indeed, after listening carefully to this release, I have to say that \\"Live in Munich\\" is uneven at best, if not plainly disappointing. Being a major Rainbow fan (especially Dio era), I eagerly expected this to be far and beyond the \\"Live in Germany 76\\" album, which, regardless of what critics might say, is a great set. Even more so now! Now I understand why Rainbow scholars kept saying that the \\"Rising\\" lineup was the best one!<br /><br />I never fully agreed with that since \\"Long Live R n' R\\" is my favorite Rainbow album, although I could probably acknowlege that \\"Rising\\" is their strongest album. But after listening to this...well...First: we only get one new song, the title track of the (at the time) upcoming release, but the tradeoff is not a good one, `cause we lose \\"Stargazer\\", without a doubt, the crown jewel of Rainbow's catalog. The rest of the songs are the same, although the length of the versions varies greatly, \\"Mistreated\\" being dramatically shorter (some 6 minutes shorter than the version off \\"Germany `76\\") and \\"Still am sad\\" dramatically longer (surpassing the 25 minute mark).<br /><br />That being said, I feel that the new versions lack the punch of the previous release, and I'm not quite sure why: I mean, the backbone of the band (Blackmore-Dio-Powell) is the same, the songs are the same...the new guys...well yeah, they're new, but it's hard for me to accept that just `cause of new bass and keyboard players a band can lose so much strength but...apparently it can...and additionally, the show had sound flaws! During \\"Do you close your eyes\\", Dio's microphone goes dead after the solo, so an entire verse goes instrumental. You can faintly hear him, but for all intents and purposes, the song gets screwed up.<br /><br />This release's biggest disappointment (other than the set list...but we knew that one going in...) it's that it fails to live up to the live recordings made during their previous german tour in '76 and to offer anything really worthy of recognition. Why, instead of playing 25 minute versions of some songs, not include a few of the many other shorter ones in Rainbow's catalog, such as \\"Run With the Wolf\\"? And no, I'm not counting the rather loose jam they have with \\"Starstruck\\" (one of my favorite Rainbow songs), which is absolutely dreadful as far as I'm concerned. What? That this is supposed to be symphonic rock, you say? Oh, rubbish!!! No wonder why punk got so big!  And to top it all, the edits that they made are simply atrocious and totally uncalled for: I mean, what's the point of making a double CD release if you're going to edit it??!! Even the intro gets cut out!! It doesn't make any sense, and it's borderline blasphemous!! Am I being too harsh? Being a huge fan, I asked myself that question but...in the end, I remembered that, until listening to \\"Germany `76\\", I didn't really like \\"Stargazer\\". That record smoked, this one doesn't.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you, like me, are a Rainbow freak, you'll probably want to pick this one up. If not, and you're a looking for an introduction to live Rainbow, my advice is to stick with the \\"Germany `76\\" set, or the recently released individual concerts from that German tour.

0767903862|5.0|I loved this book and it turned me into a Bill Bryson fan. I honestly laughed out loud when I was reading this one. I'm not the type of person who gets to read all the time, but I'm glad I made the time for this one. I gave my friend a copy who will be visiting the sunburned country in a few weeks, and I know it will make the long flight go by so quickly.

As far as I can see (not looking too hard), he's put out Heathen and Reality, both excellent CD's to get. I played this while with my wife and the beat kept going on and on and on if you know what I mean, doin Pablo Picasso and all, GET IT!
0812975219|1.0|Some readers of this type of book don't want to be distracted by important ideas when seeking nuggets about how to make wads of money.  So when deciding to purchase this book, I dismissed the many criticisms as reflecting a lack of appreciation for narrative style and individuality.  This was a mistake.      Other reviews amply (and accurately) document the author's narcissism, so I won't belabor that.  I'll limit myself to two points.    1) Taleb extensively details the weaknesses of others' investment strategies, and explains how some pretty dopey people can do quite well, at least in the short term (basically, due to luck).  He also frequently touts the superiority of his approach.  Unfortunately, he never clearly specifies what that approach is.  I kept turning the pages in a vain search for an affirmative, lucid explication of his advice.  Near as I can tell, and to save the need for anyone to read the book, here it is: make frequent, small bets on long shots because the market consistently underestimates their frequency and therefore underprices them.  You may bleed a little along the way, but the home runs will more than compensate for your discomfort.  Details on how to implement this strategy are left, implicitly, as an exercise to the reader.     (As an aside, I note that occasional success of investors due to chance is entirely compatible with standard financial theory, but unusual returns at the tails are not.  Taleb fails where Mandelbrot succeeds - see below - in making the distinction clearly and explaining why it exists.)    2) Taleb takes the reader on a meandering, though occasionally entertaining, tour of some of the trendiest ideas in academia - evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, social network theory, chaos theory (now getting a bit stale) - as well as some chestnuts from statistics, finance, and philosophy.  Don't get me wrong.  I think these things are all important, interesting, exciting, and worth reading about.  And Taleb makesno gross misrepresentations of their content, at least none worth quibbling about.  But neither does he demonstrate anything but a superficial understanding, failing to go beyond their obvious implications.  It reads like \\"here's another interesting thing I've learned a little about\\" rather than a deep synthesis relating them to each other and/or to investing.      I recently finished Mandelbrot and Hudson's \\"(Mis)Behavior of Markets\\" and the contrast could not be more stark.  Though I have significant problems with it (perhaps to be detailed in a separate review), theirs is an excellent book, well worth reading.  Mandelbrot also suffers, though less frequently, from the bouts of pomposity and self-promotion as Taleb; the difference is that Mandelbrot has some justification, having been a leader in more than one area of applied mathematics.  Where Taleb scratches the surface, Mandelbrot goes to the core.  Neither provides any \\"get rich quick\\" answers, but you will learn something from Mandelbrot.      Normally, I would cut some slack for a book where the sentences are generally well constructed and lots of interesting ideas are integrated, but in this case, so little value is added (especially relative to its exaggerated sense of erudition and self-importance) that I cannot recommend it at all.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|I'm a renthead and in my opinion, the movie really didn't do the musical justice.  =(
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I bypassed seeing this in the cinema or buying the earlier DVD edition.  I am glad that I did so.  Having watched the Director's Cut, I cannot see how any of the footage could have been cut without harming the storyline.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie: the colour, the music, the acting (well, most of it) and the portrayal of historic events.  Hopefully, this movie will encourage viewers to learn more about the period of history represented for themselves.  Many of the struggles represented here are ones we are familiar with today.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love this CD....I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!  The only thing I was upset about is that I ordered enough to get free shipping and of course wanted to take advantage of that; however, Amazon says that if I have all my items shipped together they will not be arrive in time for Christmas.  So, I pay for shipping and they ship my items separately, I get them within 2 days of each other and pay almost 20 bucks for shipping.....bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JP9V|5.0|I must say, I never read the novel, but this movie was incredible. Apart from a great story, the filmography was superb. There were scenes over five minutes long without a single change of film, and I've never been so intriged by a film. In addition, the world in which they live in extremely convincing. Exellent job with the surroundings especially for a war-torn world. My legs were shaking the whole film with suspense. All I can say is \\"Go See This Movie!\\"
B0009X7664|5.0|This movie is a classic, one of the best ever made.  If I visited somebody's house and saw this DVD sitting on the shelf as I was looking through their movie library, their \\"film\\" credibility with me would take a quantum leap.  And this two-DVD package gives you a lot of extras.  Glad I got it!
0062502182|1.0|This book is very popular and, supposedly, inspiring. A week ago, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I was shocked. The writing is completely devoid of wit, elegance, or anything remotely inspiring. Any aspiring writer in junior high armed with a stack of Hallmark cards can create this, whether or not the student has any genuine writing talent at all. The lines in the story were relentlessly corny, growing ever more cloying and insufferable with each page turned. There are no new nuggets of wisdom to be found here,only a new syrupy way to convey the old ones. I desperately wanted to stop reading before I was halfway through, but felt that I needed to finish the story to credibly give it a bad review. Hands down, this is one of the worst books I have ever read.
0312995423|4.0|I picked this up at a book fair or something.  I don't think I even paid a buck for it. I forgot who Dan Brown was when I picked it up (DaVinci Code guy) - I just liked the title.  So, yah, it's got all the Dan Brown-vibes to it: End-of-the-world type of thing going on that only 1 or 2 people know about and can fix. It reads like a movie. It was interesting and kept me interested in it.  A solid read.
1563898586|4.0|I hadn't seen the movie but had heard poor reviews, so wasn't keen to read this - until I read some reviews and lists here on Amazon. Glad I did. Alan Moore is a wonderfully creative writer of intricate stories that always ring true to me. I loved his reign at \\"Saga of the Swamp Thing\\" a while back. Kevin O'Neill's illustrations gibe well with the tale and add an interesting eye on turn-of-the-century reality. Am considering also purchasing the second volume.
0743298020|3.0|I have seen the many glowing reviews of this book.  Though it kept my attention throughout and I did enjoy elements of it I was not \\"ravished\\" by this book.   <br /> <br />I wont go into too many detail,but for example I didnt buy Margaret's profound grief over her twin, which is a central stuggle of hers.  I also figured out the big secret-the identity of the \\"ghost\\"- way earlier than i should have, robbing me of suspense.   <br /> <br />I realize the book was meant to be an homage to the Bronte/Austin style of storytelling.  However, by repeatedly mentioning these authors, Setterfield just kept reminding me that I could be reading the masterful Jane Eyre (and other classics) instead of a novel that was a pale shadow of them.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is simply a beautiful story. It is all about being a human being a the ecclectic mix of our story as people. If you need a mood booster then check this out.

B00005JPGM|4.0|I remember a candy bar commercial that left a lasting impact on me.  In this commercial there is a man who is in dire need of a Kit-Kat Bar.  He rushes to the local convenience store and see's that, to his great delight, there is only one more Kit-Kat Bar in the box, and it's all his.  Once the man leaves the store the lady at the cashier pulls another Kit-Kat Bar out of a box full of Kit-Kat Bars, and another man rushes into the store feeling as lucky as the previous man felt.  The lesson, I assumed, was that those who control the flow of supplies controls other peoples emotions.  Diamonds are sold much in this same way, where diamond companies sit on thousands upon thousands of diamonds a year, releasing very few to the general public so that they can overcharge for their beautiful little stones.<br /><br />Despite the overflow of diamonds out there, many diamonds that are sold in stores are known as either conflict diamonds or blood diamonds, which are diamonds that were bought from terrorists or other people who cause great suffering to get the diamonds.  \\"Blood Diamond\\" takes place during a civil war in Sierra Leone, where a group of revolutionaries known as the RUF have just invaded a small village of families.  There they raped the women, killed the men, and took the children with them to train them to be revolutionaries too.  One man that is spared is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a fisherman who's family is taken to a special prison, and who's son is being trained to be the next general of the FUS.  Solomon is forced to fish a river for diamond stones, where he finds the biggest diamond ever seen by man.<br /><br />Through a series of events that can only be classified as \\"way too close for comfort,\\" Solomon buries the diamond but now has a living nuisance in the form of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler who has heard about Solomon's diamond, and now wants it for himself.  Solomon wants nothing more then to save his family but lacks the connections to save them.  Danny has the connections to save Solomon's family, but only see's the effort worthwhile if Solomon will lead him to the place where the diamond is buried.  Solomon goes along with Danny but both men are joined by Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), a frustrated journalist who wants to inspire change but doesn't know where to start.  She figures if she can learn about how diamonds are smuggled she can take a good first step, which is why she is particularly interested in Danny's form of work.<br /><br />As for the FUS...well, they cause the most trouble.  In almost every scene they are in the FUS shoot guns and kill as many people as possible, in action sequences that contain blood adrenaline thrills while still containing much human tragedy.  Most action movies about tough material skates a fine line between filming fast paced action sequences while trying not to exploit a terrible situation.  In most movies the human feelings are besides the point.  In \\"Blood Diamond\\" though the story is much closer to home then most action movies will go, and therefore it would be suicide if movie tried to ignore the human dilemma in the situations.  The movie doesn't ignore the human emotions though, which leads for a more fulfilling action movie then you usually see.  Also worth noting is the excellent acting.  Leonardo DiCaprio shows that he's come a long way since he made \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" and \\"The Beach.\\"<br /><br />Sporting a very convincing Australian accent, DiCaprio not only sounds like a native from Africa, but his accent is consistent.  He manages to go through many different emotions and feelings without ever breaking character.  This is worth noting.  It's also worth noting that DiCaprio's performance is really the only performance there is to critique in the first place.  All the actors are so convincing in this movie that I forgot anyone was even acting in the first place.  The only reason I knew DiCaprio was acting is because his accent ispresent.  Otherwise though, the acting is so solid there's almost nothing to say about it.<br /><br />If there was a weak point to the acting, I would have to say it was Jennifer Connelly's performance as Maddy.  While Connelly doesn't do a horrible acting job for this part, the character itself feels a little artificial.  Yes, the beautiful reporter falls in love with DiCaprio's character, but admist all the chaos in this movie, I can't exactly pinpoint exactly where they would really have time to fall in love with each other.  The first time the two have a serious conversation about anything, Danny tells her about his childhood and how his parents died.  We see sympathy in her eyes, but anyone would fell this way after hearing a story about how ones parents died.  This does not equal romance, but the director runs with it anyway, probably knowing that if he didn't run with it the romance would seem extremely false and fake.<br /><br />The movie ends with a warning to people who buy diamonds to make sure that the diamonds you buy are not conflict diamonds.  I wonder how the consumer is supposed to know what constitutes for a conflict diamond and what doesn't, but I guess my job isn't to laminate on that too much in this review.  I don't even want to laminate on the politics of this film too much as I don't think they add up to much in the end.  What I want to laminate on is the excellent acting, spectacular action sequences, and heartbreaking ending.  Hey, I AM watching a movie as opposed to a documentary!  I think laminating on these things is worth doing after you see a good movie.  And \\"Blood Diamond\\" is a great movie.<br /><br />Rating: ****cent is present.

B000006045|5.0|This album is pure genius... from start to finish. It's amazing how the songs progress on the album to a sort of climax near the end. The song \\"Mezzanine\\" is my personal favorite, and I love how there is enough variety among songs for them to not all sound the same. The vocals are an amazing mix of beauty, mystery, and roughness, and the lyrics are poetic and dark. If you like Zero 7, Mono, or Portishead, this is a must. This is darker, less pop, and more interesting than some of Massive Attack's other stuff.
B000002IHV|4.0|It's amazed me, in retrospect, that heavy metal was able to produce some great love songs without the melodies sounding sappy and the lyrics gooey.  They could even use the word \\"love\\" without rolling your eyes (well, that was the case for me).<br /><br />\\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" is not only Ratt at their best, but a great representation of 80s metal.  The first three cuts - You're in Love, Never Use Love, and Lay It Down - are my favorites and never fail to bring a smile to my face as it gets me to thinking I was only 9 years old when I heard them for the first time (and on wonderful vinyl!).  I'm just shaking my head thinking this album is over 20 years old!  Time sure does fly!<br /><br />Truth be told, I wasn't a mega-Ratt fan, but I loved this album and it's on my short list of albums to add to the collection.  - Donna Di Giacomo

6301963717|1.0|It starts by showing Johnny Casper complaining about a bookmaker who profits illegally from a fixed fight: \\"Its not ethical!\\". But mob boss Leo explains the bookmaker is paying for protection and he won't allow him to be bumped off. Tommy loses at horses and cards (symbolism?). Leo asks Tommy about Verna; she is missing. The person hired to follow Verna was found dead, and now Leo wants to get even. [No Maltese Falcon here.] Tommy says starting a war will only cause more trouble than its worth. [Does Tommy's bad bets symbolize a loser?] <br /> <br />Tommy is brought to see Casper and offered a deal. He refuses, and earns more bad luck. [No Glass Key is broken.] Trouble seems to be developing in town. There is an attempt to assassinate Leo, but he turns the tables. But Leo can't contact the Mayor and police chief; have they switched sides? Tommy tells Leo too much about his personal life, and is kicked out of the outfit. [A good cover story for undercover work.] <br /> <br />Tommy joins the other side, and goes for a ride in the country. There is a flaw in Tommy's job performance. Now the gang war begins. [A Red Harvest?] Tommy learns that a good deed does not bring a reward. But Tommy lucks out. There are more complications, and surprises, in this confusing story. It lacks plausibility and credibility in its shocking ending. <br /> <br />Some have compared this story to some old novels from long ago, but its just a distorted shadow. It appears to be like something made for low budget TV. This story exists in a vacuum. No mention of the industry needed for this small city, presumably in the mid-west. We see people dressed in tuxedos at the gambling club, but no mention of the Ruling Elite. They don't seem to have ordinary businesses, schools, or churches. Its like a cartoon. Those who gave this film a high rating must have low standards. <br />

B000F5GNX8|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you are looking for a dynamite flick that takes the classic crime noir genre and modernizes it with a dash of a gay Val Kilmer...then this is definately the film for you.  It starts with a bang and keeps you laughing until the end.  It's one of those rare films where you thank the DVD gods for the pause button so that you can laugh without missing anything.  Don't waste your money renting this.  You will want to see it againa and again.  Buy now.

How refreshing is it to play with these pros.\\" ~ Stan Getz ~<br /><br />\\"This memorable session was Stan Getz and Oscar Peterson's first and only meeting in the recording studio as co-leaders. Stan Getz and Oscar Peterson Trio remains a most satisfying collaboration and is presented here - in its entirety - for the first time.\\"  ~ Nat Hentoff ~<br /><br />Stan Getz with Oscar Peterson, Herb Ellis and Ray Brown? Yes, indeed, on this CD! The group will utterly delight you with their outstanding performances. While I tremendously enjoyed this CD in its entirety, the part I love most is the ballad medley, which the group perfectly performed. I believe this medley is the crowning glory of this album. It's so beautiful that I can just put track #3 on a repeat mode and forget the rest of the tracks! What a brilliant idea to do a medley of all these songs so meaningful to me. This medley alone is worth the price of the CD. The songs and its respective soloists are as follow.<br /><br />\\"Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered\\" - Stan Getz, tenor sax<br />\\"I Don't Know Why, I Just Do\\" - Herb Ellis, guitar<br />\\"How Long Has This Been Going On\\" - Oscar Peterson, piano<br />\\"I Can't Get Started\\" - Ray Brown, bass<br />\\"Polka Dots And Moonbeams\\" - Stan Getz, tenor sax<br /><br />Also one of my favorites tunes here is \\"I'm Glad There Is You.\\" Stan Getz's genius shows in every note of this superb and melodic track, and Herb Ellis plays his guitar in a very creative fashion. This is one of the most sublime and notable instrumental versions of all-time. It starts off artistically with Ellis' guitar then Getz joins in slightly overpowering Ellis' guitar to make the most enchanting mix of sax and guitar simultaneously, then comes that gorgeous \\"solo showdown\\" between Getz and Ellis. It's so beautiful! I listened to it with a few repeats.<br /><br />Stan Getz can swing, too! Just listen closely to \\"I Want To Be Happy,\\" \\"Pennies From Heaven,\\" \\"Three Little Words\\" and his very own \\"Blues For Herky\\" and \\"Tour's End.\\" He plays his favorite instrument effortlessly with ease, precision and virtuosic flair.<br /><br />When jazz greats get together for a gig, the result is one great album such as this.<br /><br />An enjoyable musical journey.own \\"Blues For Herky\\" and \\"Tour's End.\\" He plays his favorite instrument effortlessly with ease, precision and virtuosic flair.

0061122416|3.0|After hearing great praise for this book and seeing a quote or two from it, I got it with admitedly high expectations. I wanted and expected to be moved, motivated and inspired. I was let down. I'm thinking maybe something was lost in the translation to english? As a previous reviewer said, this is a mild self-help book. And it's no more inspiring than one. Yes, it does have some great parts, but as a whole it was a letdown.
0743298020|3.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield was among one of the most highly touted books of 2006. A major bookstore went so far as to call it \\"a distinguished debut novel of the year.\\"  Written in the tradition of other Gothic books like those by the Bronte sisters, Daphne DuMaurier and even Victoria Holt, It had been some time since I wandered on the moors of England or sat in a comfortable but foreboding English manor home talking with a friend.  And what reader could resist an old fashioned story complete with secrets and a ghost.  With this in mind I really looked forward to this book  I even went so far as to suggest it to my book group based on other readers praises before I even read it. Unfortunately along the way something went wrong for me.<br /><br />Vida Winter, an elderly reclusive English author for 60 years, realizes her life is coming to an end.  Although many have tried to interview her and find out more about her past, she has never revealed the history of her life or what happened to the thirteenth tale. Now Ms. Winter invites a shy and retiring woman to her home to hear the full story.  Upon receiving the invitation, Margaret Lea, the daughter of an antiquarian bookseller reads a book by Ms. Winter Vida titled The Thirteen Tales.  Ending the book with only 12 tales, Margaret also wonders whatever happened to the last tale.  Although reluctant at first, Margaret does meet with Ms. Winter.  And as Ms. Winter begins to tell Margaret her story there is one stipulation.  That while Ms Winter tells Margaret her story and the missing thirteenth tale,  she will ask no questions.<br /><br />What ensues is a Gothic story filled with interesting characters (it would be safe to say that today we would call the family highly dysfunctional) abounding loyalties, well kept secrets  and a ghost.  And as the novel progresses we learn that Vida Winter and Margaret Lea learn they are bound to each other in an unexpected way.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I didn't love this book.  I certainly expected to since at one time I couldn't get enough of Gothic novels or mysteries.  While the use of words described everything beautifully and I feel as though I was in the room listening to Ms, Winter,I found the book to be very slow moving, perhaps to set the scene better, but for me it took on a plodding feeling as I read.  I also found I didn't really like the characters all that much although I tried to.  And finally I felt there were too many unanswered questions for me at the end.<br /><br />I will be curious to hear what my book group thought about this title but me, I'd rather be reading Jane Eyre or Rebecca, especially for the first time.<br /><br />PS - I wrote this book review yesterday in the morning.  The afternoon found me browsing at the library when I came across an audio of The Thirteen Tales.  Apparently I haven't quite finished with this book and now will begin listening to the discs hoping that I enjoy this venue better than the book.

B00005JP9V|3.0|Mopey office man (Theo) is brought into a rebel brigade by ex-girlfriend and mother of his dead child with the purpose of getting some travel papers to get a young girl out of England. It's 2027 and not a single birth has occurred in 18 years. The young girl is pregnant and they want to keep her safe. Mopey office man quickly bites off more than he can chew.<br /><br />This is a dark movie, much like 28 Days Later, except without the zombies. Lots of explosions, car chases and mass murders. Michael Cain has a small role as the most \\"excellent\\" best friend. Julianne Moore plays the girlfriend but don't go to see her if you're a fan. It's a very small part. Clive Owen is actually quite natural as this character especially in the one-on-one scenes with Cain.<br /><br />I have two peeves. The propagation of humanity problem is because of women's eggs. In the 1994 book of the same name, by author P.D. James, it was the sperm count that was affected. While I expect many changes when you transform a book into a movie, this detail bothers me.<br /><br />Second peeve, throughout the whole movie cats, dogs and various wildlife seem attracted to Theo. They make a point of showing it with the cinematography so I kept thinking it would come up at the end why but it never did. Even my date kept expecting something more. While the story is complete in the main story sense I felt there were gaps that may have been edited out. I'm looking forward to special features when it comes out in rentals.<br /><br />I'd watch it again. Even if you're not a Clive Owen fan it's worth seeing. I want to read the book now.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|My first impression upon watching this documentary was utter amazement and fear. In fact, \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is billed as the scariest movie you'll ever see. Could it be that life on Earth as we know it will end within the next 50 years? It did not take me long to feel that this may be the most important documentary of all time (and the scariest one)!<br /><br />In this documentary, Al Gore draws attention to the crisis of global warming. Gore blames CO2 for the temperature hikes we are experiencing worldwide. This documentary is basically a filmed version of the lectures that Gore has presented over 1,000 times to audiences all over the world.<br /><br />Gore left me no room for doubt regarding the reality of global warming as Earth's ultimate environmental crisis and eventual doom. I was fascinated and convinced by his thorough presentation. And I am not alone to feel this way. Here is what other reviewers on amazon.com have said about this documentary:<br /><br />A. A must see; a must think.<br /><br />B. The most important film I have ever seen.<br /><br />C. Very important; watch & watch again.<br /><br />D. What in the world are we waiting for?<br /><br />E. Required Viewing.<br /><br />F. Save this planet by individual action.<br /><br />G. Eye-opening!<br /><br />H. Al Gore is the smartest man on this doomed planet!<br /><br />I. Great inspiring movie. Please see it and let's change the way we live.<br /><br />J. The truth is very disturbing, but you need to see it.<br /><br />K. Don't Blow it! Good planets are hard to find.<br /><br />L. Spread the Truth.<br /><br />M. A must see for every resident of planet earth.<br /><br />N. Stunning! Seeing this film is one of the most important things you can do all year.<br /><br />O. Only 50 years from now... If you LOVE your CHILDREN, do you part to help NOW!<br /><br />Al Gore's message is quite clear: Our planet is dying due to the fact that the world is steadily getting warmer. The question is what does this mean for all of humanity and what can we do about it? This film argues the case that the effects of global warming will continue, and indeed steadily get worse.<br /><br />As I was reading the reviews on amazon.com, I found more and more people disagreeing with Al Gore. Some accused him of political manipulation. He is instilling fear in us in order for us to vote for him on the next presidential race. In other words, unless we vote for him, global warming is going to get worse and the icecaps are going to melt and we are all going to die by drowning!<br /><br />Some mistrust Gore. Some have exclaimed, \\"Isn't this the guy who said he invented the internet!?\\" Others believe that he is selling snake oil and that there is no truth in his claims. After all, they say, he is not a scientist. Shouldn't this documentary have been presented by a scientist? Furthermore, why did Gore not do something about Global Warming when he was vice-president and in a better position to do so?<br /><br />Many scientists in fact argue that his facts are not sound and that there is no correlation between CO2 and global warming.<br /><br />So which is it? Is Al Gore right and doomsday is within 50 years from now, or is this just an exaggeration and unsound science?<br /><br />Now I am not a scientist and am very new to this subject. With that said, here is the other side of the coin:<br /><br />(1) Gore says that Earth is heating up because of man-made pollutants, which are raising the level of CO2 in the air. This CO2 traps the radiated heat from the Earth, thus warming up our planet. However, not only is Earth heating up, but all of the other planets in the solar system as well. If this is so, then our man made CO2 emissions aren't the major reason for the heating of the planet. If you visit the NASA website, you'll see that the Martian ice caps are melting too! So what could be the reason for this global warming? The primary source of heat on Earth, or anywhere in our solar system, is the Sun. If it wasn't for the sun, Earth would be a ball of ice. Our Sun goes through cycles. The Earth warms or cools with increased or decreased solar activity in the sun. This is not hard to visualize since a slight change in the Sun's angle turns summer to winter or winter to summer, a difference of several degrees! Our sun could therefore be the main reason behind our global warming.<br /><br />(2) The earth has had many cooling and warming cycles for thousands of years, long before man could possibly contribute to it. The planet has seen far more severe climate changes than what we might experience and such changes have neither destroyed the planet nor the life upon it.<br /><br />(3) One volcanic eruption (such as Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic eruption in the 90's) causes far more pollution and Co2 gases than our industries. During the Gulf War in 1991, when Saddam Hussein set fire to the Kuwaiti oil fields, more pollutants had been released in the air in one go than in any other time in history.<br /><br />(4) We exhale CO2! Does this mean in order to have less CO2 in the air we must have less people on our planet? We are presently 6 billion people on Earth, and this number is rapidly increasing.<br /><br />(5) Sea level has been rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year for the past millenniums. Many scientists believe that the worst case scenario is a 2 feet rise in sea level within the next 100 years! Gore believes that we will be seeing a sea level rise of 20 feet in the next 50 years.<br /><br />In a nutshell, no one really knows enough about the global climate to really say what definitively will happen within the next 50 years. In fact, no one really knows what the weather will be in the next few days (`This will be a sunny weekend,' exclaims the weatherman, only to have a rainy weekend).<br /><br />The best we can do is to listen to all sides of an issue and then come to an educated opinion of our own. We should not let others do the thinking for us. This doesn'tmean we can keep polluting the air we breathe. Everyone should do their part in trying to keep the environment clean.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed this movie and I think it's worth seeing. At least it got me thinking!

0440237688|4.0|The Giver really is a good book.  A thought provoking read, however, I'd say for some children, it may go over their head.  This is young adult literature, and it's fine young adult literature provided you haven't read very many dystopia novels out there.  The idea is enlightening, and even though the ending is a bit ambiguous, it brings about discussion like no other.<br /><br />In the future, the world is perfect.  No one starves.  No one is left unwanted and the community assigns each person a job that they are certain to excel at once they reach the age of twelve.  When the \\"ceremony\\" finally happens, Jonas is selected by the council to be the next Receiver of Memory.  It a title of honor.  Jonas then begins his training with The Giver, who gives him memories of unimaginable things.  Color.  Feelings.  History.  The Giver holds all of them.  The Giver isn't just full of joy, he also gives Jonas memories of despair, war and others that aren't so pleasant.  As he changes over the course of one year, Jonas discovers that the \\"perfect\\" world that he lives in may not be so perfect after all.<br /><br />There are plenty of books out there just as thought-provoking as The Giver, but this is one where your brain will really turn on for a second.  As the book opens... who wouldn't want to be in this world?  Everyone is so nice to each other.  You don't have to worry about trying to find a job.  No poverty because everyone is fed, and all your decisions are made for you.  At first it feels like heaven.  But just as Jonas discovers, you too will see that this world is far from perfect, and that while we may want a world where life is simple, there's a sense of loss in having a world that would be like that.  The pains and pleasures of life should never be forgotten, which seems to be where this book is getting at.<br /><br />The characters outside of Jonas don't really come to life, but it's strangely effective in this novel for the simple reason that the people don't have feelings to begin with.  Therefore there's no need to be so heavy in character development.  However, as the novel progresses, Jonas DOES come to life as he receives new memories.<br /><br />The Giver is a great thought-provoking book but it suffers in some areas.  For one, the book hardly goes into detail on some aspects.  You get about halfway through the book before you even realize that the people in this community can't even see color.  And what themes of the book do come up don't stick around long enough (such as music) for the reader to ponder too much about it.<br /><br />Another huge aspect we have to face: The vague ending.  Some people love interpretation, those people will undoubtebly love The Giver's conclusion.  However, for those expect some sort of resolution, it isn't quite there.  That's not to say it's a bad ending.  It's just to say that it doesn't feel complete.  It certainly gives the reader a chance to interpret, but it feels anti-climatic.  All that build up for... well, virtually nothing.<br /><br />However, in some light, my disappointment with the ending may very well be what Lowry was trying to draw.  Some sort of emotional reaction.  We may never know.<br /><br />The Giver is a great thought provoking read.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to elementary school students.  It seems a bit more secondary.  Despite that, the idea is so simplistic. Anyone can understand it, but the themes and allusions may go over some of the younger readers heads.on't have feelings to begin with.

1594200823|5.0|Food.  Everybody needs it, yet hardly anybody knows where it comes from or what's in it.  Before WWII in this country, ALL food was organic.  Now, very little is.  In fact, most of the \\"healthy\\" food you buy (fruits and vegetables) is laden with pesticides and some of it is genetically-engineered and/or irradiated.<br /><br />USDA beef, chicken, and pork?  The label and seal are practically meaningless.  Chances are the animal came from a huge meat facility where animals are packed in and forced to eat antibiotics with their (unnatural, to them) feed.<br /><br />Pollan will educate you and you'll be a wiser consumer because of it.  First, he'll show you how King Corn is hidden in EVERYthing (practically) we eat -- and explain why.  Then he'll examine the raging debate in the organic world where big business (sniffing money) is moving in.  He'll also show you what it means to raise grass-fed animals (the way God intended) and why it's worth seeking out and supporting farmers who raise, slaughter, and sell such animals.<br /><br />And that's just for starters.  I'm no big fan on non-fiction books, but this one had me riveted.  Bring your appetite for knowledge, read the book, then do something about it with your dollars.  If we're going to change Big Food, we're going to have to support the Little Locals who are farming the way our grandparents (and further back) once did.  Your health depends on it.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|I fully agree with and cannot improve upon Mr. Waldo Martin's review of the movie.  If you've ever read any of Fleming's Bond books, then you already know Daniel Craig fits the character as he is supposed to be better than ANY of the previous actors.  Gone is the tiresome womanizing, adolescent humor, and the ridiculous contrivances.  Good riddance!! <br /> <br />I can't wait for the next one ... too bad we have to wait until 008!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|What has Maynard James Keenan learned in his time with A Perfect Circle? Apathy isn't it. This album has what I consider to be the best social commentary on any album of the year. In place of the angry, confused, existential warrior of previous Tool releases, MJK has matured into a rock Gandhi. The album is rich with well placed philosophical banter and social commentary. The incredible lyrics behind \\"Vicarious\\" are powerful enough to make even the most prideful American questions their TV addictions. \\"Right in Two\\" is one of the most moving Tool songs to date, uniting evolutionists / creationists / athiests alike to find peace with one another. For the older fans, songs like \\"The Pot\\" and \\"Jambi\\" will satisfy their urge for new Prog Rock.<br /><br />So what's keeping 10,000 Days from taking number 1?<br /><br />If I could rate albums for the best message / social commentary, then 10,000 Days would definitely snatch number one. But 10,000 Days lacks in one area: content. Unfortunately, the album really only has 6 finished songs. The rest is chanting, space jelly that cannot be considered anything other than studio experimentation. It's a return to the formula of their strongest release, 1996's Aenima. But Aenima had a much stronger 9 songs (surrounded by studio experimentation), making 10,000 Days feel... well, light. After a few listens- I found myself listening to 4 or 5 songs, and skipping the rest. I suppose there are worse things to complain about. This just left me wanting more content!<br /><br />Give it a listen for yourself...

B000JK8OYU|5.0|You know it's sad when the best album of the year is a collage of recordings that were originally laid down 40 years ago. But it's a well deserved success. I guess what this album really does well is hold to its mission statement: \\"You will experience this music in a whole new way\\". Not only did George Martin surpass my expectations in the execution, but he was able to give new life to some of the richest, most enduring music on the planet - while satisfying buffs and new listeners alike. It's about damn time the Beatles got some new age treatment. For the first time fans can listen to TRUE stereo & surround sound mixing of (some of) the Beatles catalogue. Crisp, exciting, refreshingly creative. It's as though the Beatles got back together and decided to play an 80 minute studio medley. Bravo. Encore?<br /><br />Best moment: The previously unreleased \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Acoustic)\\", with additional lyrics and a backing score written by George Martin.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|What really bugs me about movies \\"inspired\\" or \\"based on\\" real life events, is that the producers take that real-life event, and then fictionalize it into something unrecognizable.  If people don't research what they've seen, they go away thinking \\"this is how it happened\\".  Spielberg, at least is honest when he says the \\"facts\\" are that there was a terrorist attack in Munich, the Israeli government decided to retaliate, and some of those terrorists were indeed killed.  Beyond that, most of this movie is fiction.<br /><br />The intelligence sources used to track down the targets were not the quasi organized crime characters depicted in the film.  Apparently, much of the information came from Israeli Intelligence.  Why the change?  There's probably more drama in some shadowy trans-national organization.  Some people perceive some sort of \\"balance\\".  I suppose it depends upon one's perspective.  If one cannot differentiate a terrorist act like the massacre in Munich from a government taking measures (albeit extreme) to protect it's citizens from future attacks, then I suppose that individual could interpret things like the overdone depiction of personal trauma suffered by the team members as a message against direct retaliation.  Although most people would have difficulty killing someone in cold blood, I doubt that the actual Mossad trigger-pullers had the misgivings depicted in the film.<br /><br />The message that killing a terrorist only causes another to step forward is flawed.  The same would be true with capture and trial.  The Israelis have used every method imaginable, ranging from direct negotiation, to capture and trial, to assassination.  The fact is that these groups want what won't be given...the elimination of Israel as a nation.  The only alternative for Israel (and us too) is to fight, making the price of terrorism ever higher for it's perpetrators.  This is not a purely military issue.  In some cases, it is practical to capture, try in open court, and imprison.  In others, the only way to eliminate a threat is to go out and kill it.  Yes, others will probably step forward, but they will not be as skilled or experienced, and may at least be impeded by the knowledge that they have to live in constant fear, or at least concern, for their own safety.  There doesn't seem to be much room for moral hand wringing when the alternative is one's own destruction.imprison.  In others, the only way to eliminate a threat is to go out and kill it.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|Chapter 11 of Genesis tells a story of mankind's attempt to reach heaven by building a tower, not as a way to glorify God but as a way for mankind to glorify themselves by putting them on God's level. God strikes the plan down by confusing/creating different languages so that the builders cannot understand each other thereby suspending communication. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, along with his screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's take on this material is \\"Babel\\" their third and most ambitiously produced film with locales in Morocco, Japan, San Diego and Mexico and like the Bible story, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is once again dealing with communication or lack thereof: how we talk and either no one listens or more to the point...doesn't understand. Simple themes told exceedingly well here.<br /><br />In the best sequence, shot in Japan a deaf mute girl, Chieko (Rinko Cucuchi), desperate for attention and contact other than she can get from her pals, tells (actually signs) to her father (a sad sack Koji Yakusho from \\"Shall We Dance?\\"): \\"You Never Listen to Me!\\" Ironic on at least a couple of levels. Chieko is reeling from the normal drama of being a teen as well as the not so normal drama of having found her Mother dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She is also dealing with a father who is also devastated and unable to comfort himself much less his daughter. They live in a glacial glass high-rise box in Tokyo: a symbol of the icy coldness of the lives that they live within.<br /><br />The two other parts of the film deal with the stars (a very good Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) in Morocco on vacation (!?) and a supposed terrorist attack and the third, a very real and scary sequence involving the Pitt/Blanchett children and their caretaker, Amelia (a terrific Adriana Barraza) and their harrowing journey into Baja California.<br /><br />Every one of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's films (\\"Amores Perros,\\" \\"21 Grams\\" and \\"Babel\\") contain at least one gut-wrenching, emotional and transcendentally beautiful scene: the dog fight in \\"Amores Perros,\\" the Naomi Watts scene with Sean Penn in which she explains how it is to lose a family in a random accident in \\"21 Grams\\" and here in Babel: Chieko at a Shinto dance club, the soundtrack stopping and starting to approximate Chieko's experience, Chieko: wide-eyed, wide-eyed, mouth agape...experiencing a world in which feeling and touching is paramount and hearing isn't.<br /><br />Though I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga stretch the \\"if a butterfly flutters its wings in Hawaii, etc.\\" metaphor to the breaking point, there is no doubt that<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" has got the goods where it counts: deep in the recesses of its soul and heart.ful scene: the dog fight in \\"Amores Perros,\\" the Naomi Watts scene with Sean Penn in which she explains how it is to lose a family in a random accident in \\"21 Grams\\" and here in Babel: Chieko at a Shinto dance club, the soundtrack stopping and starting to approximate Chieko's experience, Chieko: wide-eyed, wide-eyed, mouth agape...experiencing a world in which feeling and touching is paramount and hearing isn't.  <br />Though Iñárritu and Arriaga stretch the \\"if a butterfly flutters its wings in Hawaii, etc.\\" metaphor to the breaking point, there is no doubt that  <br />\\"Babel\\" has got the goods where it counts: deep in the recesses of its soul and heart.  <br />
1594481938|3.0|I've come to the conclusion that I don't \\"get\\" Nick Hornby.  It seems I have the opposite reaction than most people have to his works.  For example, I thought that How To Be Good was pitch-perfect brilliant.  However, most Hornby fans thought it was his worst work to date.  Now comes A Long Way Down, which many Hornby fans (and quite a few critics) have stated is a return to form for the author.  I, on the other hand, thought the book was just...okay. <br /> <br />Two factors weakened the book for me.  The first was Hornby's decision to make the narrative an interlocking series of four first person accounts.  While the narrative does move along nicely, having each story told in the first person takes away from Hornby's great skill of writing masterful dialogue.  Without this dialogue, I found the story difficult to enjoy.  Another factor that detracted from my enjoyment was the decision to make most of the book's central characters unsympathetic.  Other than Maureen, who moves from a selfish desperation to a quiet acceptance of her role in life, all of the other characters are very unlikable.  It can even be argued that by the end of the book, they really hadn't grown past the issues that brought them to a building's ledge in the first place.  Consequently, it was hard to enjoy a book about four miserable people, three of whom are relatively comfortable being miserable. <br /> <br />Again, I don't know if it's just Hornby's take on topics, or if I just don't possess enough brain cells to comprehend the message (please, no speculation in the comments area on which option is more likely).  But, I do know that despite the trademark pop culture references and the glimmers of incredible dialogue, A Long Way Down is a book that doesn't quite live up to Hornby's ability and reputation.

0920668364|1.0|Do you want your mother to \\"love you forever\\" so much that even when you're grown-up and living in your own home, she drives over in the middle of the  night and climbs through your window and rocks you like a baby? Because that's what happens in this weird & creepy book. You want to be stalked by your mother into old age? This book is seriously unhealthy. Ick. When I worked at a children's bookstore, we used to hide it from customers and put other alternatives in their hands. Plus, the illustrations are so flat out ugly.  This is not about how much parents love their children (which involves letting them grow up), this is about not being able to let go. I think Munsch needs therapy.
B000HBKCDC|1.0|Track four from which the album gets its name, written by Sarah McLachlan, is absolutely stunning in its lyric-melodic combination.  It truly paints a picture of, and provides comfort for, anyone experiencing grief during the Christmas season.  In addition, her renditions of traditional songs such as Noel are soulful, powerful performances.  I just pulled the CD from my car--and it's five weeks since Christmas!

7119005901|5.0|For Americans. Is it the correct translation? No, but that is okay, because a lot of people who buy this book will have done so from exposure to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games from Koei, and they used the Americanized spelling that unfortunately doesn't match up pronunciation wise, but the names are the same as they appear in all the games. I much prefer this, as I bought a copy of the original translation, and had no idea who the hell they were writing about. For those of us who got exposed to this, one of the greatest stories (about 70% true) ever told, having to go back and relearn all the names would be VERY taxing, not to mention annoying as hell.
0765315246|2.0|That's it. It's miliporn. The concept was great, but in the end the author was not up to developing it. Actually its low grade miliporn because it's pretty obvious this guy is a Deitz-wannabe but hasn't the chops to pull it off. The Deitz cyborg legion covers the same issues from the same empty right wing positon but does a much better job. Or read, Their Master's War; The enternity Brigade; The Forever War; Bill, The Galactic Hero, I could go on but why point out so many books that do a better job on the theme? <br /> <br />The real tragedy, of course is that the author has a great idea. If I was an editor and been given a choice sight unseen between this work and the Clone Republic I would pick this book immediately. The problem is that the clone Republic is a higher grade of miliporn than this piece. That's too bad because if he could open up his view and write for the sake of his work and not a check, this author could be a fantastic writer.

0618680004|5.0|I absoulutely loved \\"The God Delusion.\\"  I finished it yesterday, and I felt like a new man.  While reading it, I was proud and felt a common bond with all free thinkers.  We do not need god, and Dawkins lays out why.  I have previously been hiding my Atheism, afraid of the reprocussions of my friends and family.  This book helped me to see that religion is a shield for those who cannot accept reality.  I highly reccommend this book to anyone needing exact justification as to why religion is not only useless, but harmful to society.  Way to go Dr. Dawkins.  I can only hope to have an educated conversation with a man such as yourself.

B0000046ZJ|5.0|There are so many superlatives about this album.  The first thing one new to the Peterson trio may notice is the lack of drums.  And yet, the trio swings so hard that it's very easy to forget.  Getz's soft, gentle tone on sax makes a stark but highly effective foil to Peterson's high-energy keyboard acrobatics and staggering virtuosity.  The bass and guitar hold everything together transparently, working together in perfect syncronization during the solos, to keep the energy at a proper pitch at all times, then peeling off to do their own magic when it's their turn to solo.  The speedy opening cut, \\"I Want to Be Happy\\", constantly pops with surprises and new textures.  Often, I'll play it twice in a row because it's so much fun to listen to.  This album is top jazz musicians at the top of their game.

B000EBEHR2|1.0|i love placebo, they've been my favorite for so many years, so fellow placebo fans, don't hate me. this pains me very much. The first and second album i absolutely loved, the third was great but different from the other 2, the forth had some great songs and i liked it(this was showing the start of their decline in my opinion), but Meds, oh my. There are about 3 songs on this album i love. this is not good because on some of their other albums, i loved every single song, they sounded different. but alot of the songs on meds sound too much a like for my taste. The thing is, their previous stuff really showcased a raw talented, passionate sound of the vocals, guitar, and drums. on meds, it's like they traded their instruments for synthesizers which gives off a cold, robotic, repetative sound, which isn't the great sound they used to have which led to their success. it sounds too processed. meds sounds like the album that the mainstream wants to hear instead of the placebo fans that loved them in the beginning when they weren't as popular. i love these guys, but they need to bring back nancyboy, and rid themselves of these new electronic producers and equipment where just pushing buttons gives you sounds, and go back to basics. last, brians (the singer)lyrics on this album were so simple, before his lyrics were more complex with more hidden meanings, meds is so blunt and straightforward. <br />i hope they go back to their roots and bring back that human element to their music. <br />all in all, they're still great, for me, their past music and some present, will always be the best music i've ever heard.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|[...]<br /><br />First I want to start with the trailers.  All the trailers I saw are COMPLETELY misleading us... I was led to believe the movie was about an American couple in some Arab country who, because of the accident involving the gun, the husband is trying to save the wife but because no one speaks english, he cannot get the appropriate help, while another story happens somewhere else following the same protocol.<br /><br />Completely wrong.  Everyone understands each other (except for the Japanese girl who is absolutely impossible to comprehend) and there's no language barriers between anyone (the couple has a helpful man who translates for them).<br />Brad Pitt's character had a helpful Muslim guy who spoke Morrocan Arabic and English, the Japanese girl knew sign language and could write, the Mexican nanny could speak English and Spanish, the Morrocan boys had no trouble speaking with anyone else in some other language.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, I think if the stories had been made out into separate short movies, all still connected, but in different segments, with much of the brutal scenes toned down by a lot, it could have worked out great, but all together like that, it was too painful to watch.<br /><br />First off, it's way too brutal. For seemingly no reason, the movie seems to grab you, rip at your heart, only to save you from breaking apart with a minor footnote that everything's going to be alright, then continuing to strip your heart sinew by sinew.<br /><br />It's brutal, but also tasteless and tactless.  First off, we have a little arab kid not even 13 masturbating in front of the camera while fantasizing about his cousin whose been putting on a show for him in the shower while he spies through a hole in the wall.<br />We also have a Japanese girl who is apparently deranged and has no fear of being raped, wandering out in public with a miniskirt and flashing boys at the discotheque or w/e, then calling up a police detective involved in a case with her mother and stripping naked before him.<br />We also have Brad Pitt dry-humping Cate Blanchett's character while she's urinating in a pan and slowly bleeding from the gunshot wound.<br />We've also got the Morrocan kids getting involved in a police shootout and one of the boys getting shot and killed.<br />We've got an old man and his old wife being brutalized by the police in Morroco.<br />We've got two American kids nearly dying in the Texas desert because the border patrol gives up on finding them after a few minutes.<br />We've got a nanny who has devoted her life to the two kids, and has spent 16 years in America, only to be deported when she's discovered to be an illegal alien, without being allowed to recover her 16 years worth of property, contacting her 16 years' worth of contacts, friends, or even to say goodbye to the two children she's loved for so long, just given a snotty-assed response by a snotty-ass immigration officer, \\"You should have thought of that BEFORE you snuck into our country [16 years ago]\\"<br /><br />The stories are so loosely connected as to be completely irrelevent, most especially in the case of Chieko, the Japanese deaf-mute girl.  Chieko's story and Amelia's (the Mexican nanny's) story have absolutely nothing to do with each other, or the shooting incident, save for the fact that Amelia is the nanny of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's character's kids, and Chieko is the daughter of the man who originally owned the gun involved.<br /><br />The stories: For one, there's the deaf-mute Japanese girl who is so<br />sexually starved that she's apparently gone insane, licking her<br />dentist, flashing her crotch at boys at the J-pop, and literally<br />exposing herself to a police detective and forcing him to hold her<br />breast.  [...] Her story is in no way connected to all the others save for one piece of insignificant detail; her father owned the gun involved in the<br />shooting of Cate Blanchett's character, then gave it to a Morrocan<br />guide, who sells it to the guy whose kids are involved in the shooting.<br /><br />Two, the Morrocan kids get ahold of the gun from their father who buys<br />it from the guide to shoot jackals who keep eating his goats. The kids<br />play around with it, and remember the guide saying that the bullets<br />could travel 3 kilometers. They don't believe this, so they test it buy<br />shooting at cars and buses on the road. They hit a bus, and obviously<br />hit Cate Blanchett's character, then run away in a panic. This starts a<br />police investigation, in which the police began torturing the guide who<br />originally owned the gun and his wife, and then leads to the family.<br />The father discovers what the sons have done, and he beats them, then<br />the kids take him to where they have hidden the gun. They find it, and<br />on their way off, the police find them, and this leads to a shoot-out<br />which leaves the older brother shot and presumably dead, with one of<br />the officers wounded as the younger brother shoots back. He then breaks<br />the gun, and surrenders to the police, fearing they will shoot him.<br /><br />Next is the seemingly \\"main storyline\\" involving Brad Pitt's character<br />and Cate Blanchett's characters. Neither have names, or if they do,<br />they are never given directly or indirectly to the audience. This story<br />is perhaps the dullest of them all, in which Cate Blanchett's character<br />is shot, and rather than turn back where they came, the tour guide<br />brings them to his village, where they sit there, slow down her<br />bleeding, and then wait for hours for an ambulance to arrive. A man<br />arrives to tell them the US embassy pulled the ambulance out at the<br />last minute to send a helicopter instead, meaning it will take even<br />longer to arrive. All in all, nothing dramatic happens, except Cate's<br />character pees in a pan while Pitt's character kisses her sloppily and practically dry humps her, then she is taken out by helicopter and cared for at a hospital, where Pitt's character checks up on his kids and their Mexican nanny, where her story now begins.<br /><br />Now the Mexican nanny Amelia, whose story, I believe, is the most<br />cold-hearted and brutal at the hands of the filmmakers. She wants to<br />attend her son's wedding in Mexico, but she has to care for the<br />children and has nowhere to leave them. So she brings them with her,<br />and her nephew Santiago drives them down across the border, where they<br />attend the wedding, and Santiago gets drunk.<br /><br />At nightfall, they are driving to the border, and the border patrol stops them as they realize he is drunk. When asked to pull over, he simply speeds through, and tries to lose the cops in the desert. Then he tells Amelia and the kids to get out of the car, he will lose the cops, and come back for him.<br /><br />The next morning, they are seen a dirty mess sleeping under some<br />sharp-looking wooden desert things, and Santiago is nowhere to be seen.<br />Not only that, they are completely lost. She tries to find a road from<br />which to signal for help, but cannot find any, so she leaves the girl<br />(who is asleep) and tells her brother to look after them, she will find<br />help and return. She finds a patrol officer finally, and tries to tell<br />him about the kids in the desert. He decides instead to arrest her, as<br />apparently she was a suspect when Santiago sped away in the car.<br /><br />Finally he lets her lead him to the children, but she cannot find them<br />because the desert sucks, or the children have moved. When she is shown<br />before a border officer person, she is told the children were found,<br />but would have been nearly dead. The officer then proceeds to brutally<br />rip into her, essentially saying it was her fault and that the children<br />could have died (because, you know, in the desert, you'll die if an<br />adult isn't sitting next to you),then he has her deported, her<br />property confiscated, in true ancient Roman proscription fashion, not even allowed to say goodbye to her 16 years' worth of friends, family, and the two kids who in the end I believe still love her. She<br />never sees the kids again and is left in abject poverty, trying to find<br />her son back in Mexico who she finally does find at the very end of the movie.<br /><br />Also, people looking to see \\"Brad Pitt's best performance\\" should know that at most, he gets probably 10-15 minutes of screen time. And even that amount is nothing more than looking somber, or looking a wreck because his wife is dying.<br /><br />All in all in all, I really don't understand how to categorize the movie, or how even to judge it properly, but this was one movie that made me depressed for all the wrong reasons... it was very heavy on raw emotion, for seemingly no purpose other than to toy with the audience's emotion and make them cry.<br /><br />I don't understand why I hated it and thought it terrible, but I just do. Honestly, I believe you should go see it for yourself to truly judge. [...]<br /><br />I have to repeat what I said above: If each individual story were separated from the big mash it was mushed into for \\"Babel\\", and made into separate little movies, or even TV movies, and released separately, but still connected, it could have worked, and worked great (aside from the brutal parts which would need a heavy-hand toning down the gritty brutality)., I believe, is the most  cold-hearted and brutal at the hands of the filmmakers.

B00005NG9Z|5.0|Watching this video, I thought two things.  One, what a great and artistic group of musicians Alice in Chains was.  It's the kind of music that when you listen to the lyrics you feel the souls of Staley and Cantrell just pouring out in their music.  It's all the more evident when you see it.  At the same time, it's amazing to trace how Layne Staley disintegrated from his rampant heroine from the early videos to the MTV unplugged show AIC performed.  The irony is that if he was clean, we probably wouldn't have any of this music to remember him by.  Sometimes I guess it's better to burn out than fade away.  A great DVD.

But I have to admit the sound quality here is very good,plus Frankie Valli and crew had some wonderfully created vocal harmonies. Tunes most of us remember are here, like \\"Sherry\\",\\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\", \\"Walk Like A Man\\" (perhaps my Four Seasons favorite), \\"Candy Girl\\", \\"Let's Hang On(To What We've Got)\\", \\"C'mon Marrianne\\" and \\"December,1963 (Oh,What A Night)\\". Also sort of liked the solo hits from Valli. Honestly, it's been SO long since I've heard and of this. Would make a great gift idea.

VERY big \\"but\\", if you are a fan of Sci-Fi at all, or even if you simply enjoy a darn good story, then you owe it to yourself to TOTALLY disregard the fact that Firefly was made by the same people. Personally, I find this to be fully un-credible and I found it impossible to believe until it was proven to me. <br />Firefly is easily right up there with B5 and is certainly one of the very best television shows that has ever been produced!! Story, music, characters, EVERYTHING about this show screams quality! I can only wonder what sort of \\"nob end's\\" FOX has working for them (or was it the \\"BIG\\" boss that canned it?). At any rate, the canning of Firefly has got to be the most idiotic, shortsighted and tragic act in television history.... bar none that I am aware of (well.... I still think B5 should have been about 2 or 3 seasons longer to fully flesh out the epic story). When Crusade was canned it saddened me, but when I heard that Firefly had been canned, I genuinely cried (after I sat there gathering fly's and carpet fluff on my tounge and bottom lip for about an hour)!! <br />I can only hope that this helps a few other Buffy/Angel haters out there get past their initial scepticism and see Firefly for what it really is....... a Sci-Fi/storytelling masterpiece! <br />Oh, and DO NOT miss the follow up movie Serenity. It is not quite as brilliant, but still a fully worthy way to \\"round off\\" the story. I think they did just about as well as the short timeframe allowed. Just make sure you are sitting down on a chair which has side's (so there is less chance of you falling off) and have a box of tissues at hand!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Slightly darker, some of the frivolous feel of the original has been toned down (without removing the humor), and the special effects and sound have been improved. I think my wife and I should have a son so we can watch it over and over and over and over again. Maybe get a few Star Wars toys and scatter them all over the house.
B000J103PC|5.0|Geez, Meryl Streep is phenomenal in her role as the editor-in chief to elite fashion magazine \\"Runway\\" and plays the perfect boss from hell. I can't imagine any other actress for this role! Also nice to see actress Anne Hathaway mature as an actress and move beyond \\"The Princess Diaries\\".    This movie is fast paced, humorous, and a total chick flick at heart. I loved every second of this movie.... Sure its no Oscar Nominee, its not meant to be anything other than just pure entertainment.
0307276902|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars, except for the whole Oprah incident....it leaves you wondering what is true and what is exagerrated. Take my advice and try to ignore what you heard and read this book for what it is. Frey has a great writing style. He will suck you in to his crazy life from page one. You can't help but root for James though out the book and I STILL do! I wish James would have never went on Oprah. Don't be tainted by what you have heard and check this book out. You will cheer, laugh and maybe cry. I laughed out loud and truly enjoyed James' sarcasm and humor.
B00000DR8R|5.0|a huge gap exists between the strength of this album and the recognition it gets. it is a true classic, for my money the best album of the decade bar none. buy it.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|If you like Cirque du Soleil, you will love this mixing of classic beatles songs. The album flows really well, but it is obvious that it was rendered for a performance. It seems a bit dark for a beatles album, and especially one titled love, but has some great remixes nonetheless.
0618680004|5.0|It covers all religions and gives an explanation of why he detest religion. His scientific reasoning is excellent but at somtimes gets very deep and fervid.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|When the movie first began I thought it to be somewhat boring,but as the movie goes on it captivates the audience.In fact,it actually illudes the audience.<br /><br />The story is of a young magician who desperatly wants to be with the woman he loves,unfortunately he is a peasant and she is a duchess,the two are separated at youth but reunited by fate in further years. The Duchess(sophie) is the soon to be bride of the crowned prince thus still separating the two lovers.<br /><br />The story turns into the saddened murder story of Sophie,once she attempts to escape the marriage.A heart-broken illusionist begins to attempt to reveal the truth about her murder.<br /><br />The Illusionist is definately an offer of hope to american film industries.It contains the classics all compiled;mystery,romance,fairy tale,magic and adventure.I recommend all to see it,you'll want to watch again and again only to have more things revealed.<br />After all,everytime you see a magic trick-you see something you didnt see before.
B00000I07Q|5.0|Bon Jovi is one of the few 80s' rock bands that can survive commercialy even to this day. Their third and previous album SLIPPERY WHEN WET became super hit, with two #1 hits YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME and LIVING ON A PRAYER. 1988 follow up NEW JERSEY became more solid and vivid than the predecessor well balanced in pop and wild appeal of the band.<br /><br />LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME and BAD MEDICINE both became huge hits from the album but other tracks shine in its own right. Particularly I like fifth track BLOOD ON BLOOD and fast-paced track 99 IN THE SHADE which keep our adrenalin running.<br /><br />Verdict: One of their finest efforts and one of the best late 80s rock albums.<br /><br />Rating: 96 out of 100<br /><br />Recommended for: 80s rock fans and wide range of pop rock fans.
0156027321|4.0|This is a very well written \\"page-turner\\" type book.  The beginning can seem sort of slow, but it's full of crucial character development.   Once I got to the part where he is stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, I could barely stop reading until the end.  My only complaint is that the author seems to insult the intelligence of most adult readers by pointing out subtle symbolism, etc.  Kills the mystery and takes the fun out of deconstructing a book after being finished with it. <br /> <br />All in all, this is highly recommended for middle school/high school students as well as adults who are looking for a quick read.  It'll make you feel like you've been stranded in the middle of the Pacific!
B000FILW86|4.0|There's really no need to compare the new Cheap Trick to the Cheap Trick of the past because ROCKFORD stands tall on it's own.  Robin Zander's trademark vocals are here along with the live sound that the band so seemingly strives for.  After a strange verse, \\"If It Takes A Lifetime\\" slips into an absolutely killer chorus complete with terrific backing vocals.  An inviting keyboard leads into the mid-tempo stomp of \\"This Time You Got It\\" and \\"Every Night and Every Day\\" is a tune heavily influenced by The Beatles with all of the Cheap Trick flourishes on display.  It's awesome to have Cheap Trick still contributing great music to the Pop/Rock genre.

080701429X|5.0|Hitler had occupied Austria when Viktor Frankl, a young Viennese psychiatrist and writer, learned that the United States had approved his request to immigrate. His parents were overjoyed --- their son would escape the Nazis, go off to America and continue his brilliant work.<br /><br />Frankl was feeling guilty about leaving his parents when he noticed a piece of marble on a table at home. What was it? His father said it was a piece of the largest synagogue in Vienna, burned by the Nazis. On it was a fragment of the Ten Commandments --- the part about honoring thy father and mother.<br /><br />Rock covers paper. Frankly decided to stay in Vienna and look after his parents. As if that were possible! Before the war was over, the Nazis imprisoned Frankl, his pregnant wife, his brother and his parents. All but Frankl perished.<br /><br />In 1945, in just nine days, Frankl wrote \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" It has sold tens of millions of copies, been published in dozens of languages --- for many, it's been a life-changer. Somehow, I missed every opportunity to read it. Just as well. My younger selves might have missed the profundity of this short, simple book.<br /><br />Frankl's message is simple: Life can be terrible. But there is one power you alone possess --- the power to decide what you think about your situation. If you think there is a point to your suffering and if you can imagine your life on the other side of it, you are searching for meaning.  More, you are finding meaning, for the very act of searching ennobles you. Achievements can pile up, riches may come your way --- none of that matters. The search is everything.<br /><br />For Frankl, the search for meaning is both a philosophy and an attitude. Going into a concentration camp, he knew what the odds were --- 90% of the people on his transport train would die, most within a few hours of arriving at Auschwitz. And this led him to his first breakthrough: \\"I struck out my whole former life.\\"<br /><br />Auschwitz became his teacher. He had no fear of death; the gas chambers spared him the thought of suicide. He learned to look eager for work; if you want to live, you have to be useful. And then he learned The Secret. Let him tell it:<br /><br />We stumbled on in the darkness, over big stones and through large puddles, along the one road running through the camp. The accompanying guards kept shouting at us and driving us with the butts of their rifles. Anyone with very sore feet supported himself on his neighbor's arm. Hardly a word was spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his hand behind his upturned collar, the man marching next to me whispered suddenly: \\"If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are better off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us.\\"<br /><br />That brought thoughts of my own wife to mind. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another on and upward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look then was more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.<br /><br />A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth -- that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.<br /><br />I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world may still know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when a man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way--an honorable way--in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life, I was able to understand the words, \\"The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.\\"<br /><br />Those are easy words to write in the comfort of the coffeehouse, surrounded by attractive people who have the dual luck of health and wealth. But to feel this way after being shipped to four concentration camps and losing your loved ones --- that's something else.<br /><br />Yes, Frankl was lucky, and he knows it; as he says, \\"The best among us did not return.\\" But the lucky did. Indeed, only the lucky did. And isn't a great part of luck the irrational belief of a better future?<br /><br />Like all concentration camp memoirs, Frankl's is one horror after another. But unlike almost all others, his memoir is dotted with remarkable scenes. Like the time a block warden, at a very low point in the war, asks Frankl to speak to the inmates. Frankl reminds them that all they have lost can be achieved again. And then he says something at once shocking and inspiring: \\"Human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have meaning.\\" Even hopelessness offers a kind of dignity. If we act well in dire straits, we honor God --- we show that, even as we are killed, we maintain our dignity. That was some sermon....<br /><br />Days after the war ended, Viktor Frank walked out of the camp and into the countryside. He listened to the birds sing; he felt the expanse of earth and sky. He did not yet know that the wife he thought of constantly was dead. He had just one sentence running through his head: \\"I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in the freedom of space.\\" And with that, Frankl walked into his future.<br /><br />Why read \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" now? Because we live in an age of weak excuses and phony explanations and very few people stepping forward to take responsibility for anything. In this appalling time, Viktor Frankl reminds us that what we do and how we think about it actually matter. He tells us that, even on a crowded planet, every life is important. He makes us stand tall and see clearly and think straight and want to do right.<br /><br />It doesn't get much simpler than that, does it?f moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.

B00005JP9V|3.0|This a bold. challenging, ingenious yet flawed movie. It is mostly for film buffs/sci fi fans and arty types.<br /><br />The premise is fascinating...women are now infertile and the human race is dying out. The world has gone down the crapper. Immigrants are now subjected to concentration camps and are considered lower than low. There is a discovery of a pregnant immigrant and her baby will be the subject of some type of multiple illicit political ploys.<br /><br />Clive Owen is a real cool actor. He is no action hero yet he is a man's man. He is not loud and brash yet he radiates charisma. His acting talent was effectively demonstrated in the terrific drama \\"Closer\\".<br /><br />There are two action sequences that are quite harrowing. One involves an unexpected ambush in a car and the other is Clive Owen chasing/looking for a baby while an apartment building is in the midst of a military attack. Both scenes involve (I believe) just one camera take (a la \\"Saving Private Ryan's\\" opening beach battle scene) so you know the battle does not take place on a sound stage but rather it is laid out in a more elaborate manner. The long takes makes it look like it is really taking place, like it is a documentary.<br /><br />An issue with the movie is the lack of narrative. I guess, the viewer catches wind of what is going on while Clive Owen's charactor does but the effect makes the movie slow at times. It is hard to understand the depth of any of the charactors because of this type of story telling. Charactors come and go (like... die off) and the movie really does not deal with it.<br /><br />Lastly, (I am not giving away anything), the ending is abrubt and very unfullfilling. The movie starts out slow. builds up steam, captures your passion and then has a very weak ending. That may not be the film's fault since the movie is adapted from a novel. Whatever it was, I thought the movie was anticlimactic.<br /><br />Now, I give this movie a big thumbs up because it was great science fiction. It was no lasers/robots/spaceships sci fi but, rather, a plausible plot occuring in the not so distant future. You would have to think about this flick when it's over.<br /><br />This may be like a Stanely Kubrick movie where you just are not going to get it upon one viewing. Theer are a lot of subtleties in the movie that may need a second analysis.<br /><br />Since there are so many problems in today's world, I like a good dommsday movie.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|You will not believe that only three guys comprise this band.  They are tight as a drum.  It is a rarity that you can have someone equally proficient on mulitple instruments as shown by Matthew Bellamy on guitar and vocals. And they can reproduce this live, just check out the videos on Youtube! <br /> <br />To the album itself, Take a Bow, Starlight, Assasin, Supermassive Black Hole, and Knights of Cydonia are the standout tracks witb the others supporting the album.  Their vocal harmonies are reminincent of Queen and their musicianship is top notch.  If you like bands like Queen and other prog/art groups this album is for you.
6304698623|5.0|This DVD is beautiful, because you didn't focus on the lighting, or the quality of the sound. The plot draws you in, until the only thing you can think of is \\"What happened to her father?\\" \\"How will she survive in the attic?\\" Its about a girl, named Sara, who, no matter what happens, through good times and bad times will always be \\"a princess\\". She never gives up hope! I find Sara, not only sweet and angelic, but an excellent role model. It's great!
B0002JJBZY|1.0|Now let me state right out that I am a huge fan of the original show. Maybe too huge. I find it IMPOSSIBLE to believe that any company putting out anything of this magnitude and expense wouldn't go to the original 35mm prints to bring to DVD, but no. This is a transfer of horrific quality, the orgin of which was obviously the scratchy, scraped damaged 16mm prints sent out to multitudes of local stations for syndicated broadcast, most of whom cut out entire scenes (that no one would notice, so they THOUGHT) to fit in more commercials. To make it even worse, in the 80's they took these horrific prints, cut out a certain percetage of film frames from the ENTIRE FILM they had left, and then SPED UP THE AUDIO, BADLY, to COMPENSATE when making the videotape collections. Willam Shatner SOUNDS LIKE A CHIPMUNK THROUGH THE ENTIRE THING. He should SUE. Nichelle Nichols, a mezzo with a deep voice, turns into a little girl soprano. The movement of everyone is rushed, the pace is relentless, they recut the thing to have more dialog interruptions and people talking over other people's lines wherever they could. The action is jerky as if watching a bad quality AVI with dropped frames.    This collection is HORRENDOUS, a travesty of a great history-making show and possibly the pinnacle of \\"old Hollywood\\" style filmaking. Must have been overseen by executives in their 30's WHO NEVER SAW THE ORIGINALS, EVEN ONCE.    Save your money for the new HD remasters, even though they'll change a million things, some of which they'll make better, some of which they won't. They can't possibly mess it up any more than this pile. This set is unwatchable junk, unless you like Alvin and the Chipmunks and Keystone Cops.    It's not even worth downloading. I know some people like it, but they can't possibly have ever seen the originals.    Oh, the color scheme of the cases is nice.      ****    UPDATE    Well thanks for the clarification. That would explain the widely disparate responses to this set. Ireturned mine, so now to be on the safe side I will wait EAGERLY for the remastered versions. From the handful of episodes I've seen on TV, they're FANTASTIC, they did a very respectful bang-up job. The footage of the enterprise orbiting various planets is brilliantly done and adds a realism the original grainy flickering footage that looked like it was shot in the 1940's didn't. Special efx have come a long way.    If these sets are as most of you say they are, then it would be great for real fans to have both versions. I might even take another chance on this set someday.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|If you think it's funny to watch a grandfather say the \\"F\\" word constantly in the presence of his 7 yr old granddaughter and to advise his teen grandson to \\"F\\" alot of women, then this movie is for you. Christian bashing is alive and well as the teen boy wears a t-shirt saying \\"Jesus Was Wrong\\" the entire movie. Also, pornography is endorsed and the 7 yr old does a striptease at the end that some would label child porn. This movie will damage your soul and your children's souls.  <br />

B00005JJX8|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock made two kinds of movies: bone-chilling thrillers that looked into the dark side of human nature, and witty adventure stories.<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a sterling example of the latter kind of movie -- a chic, sleek, golden-tinted caper, full of witty dialogue and solid acting from legendary actors. Despite the taut action scenes, Hitchcock makes it feel almost like a cinematic vacation.<br /><br />Paul Robie (Cary Grant) was \\"The Cat,\\" the most notorious jewel thief in Europe, before he retired. But now impossible heists -- made in Robie's style -- are popping up all over Cannes, and he's the immediate suspect. Narrowly escaping the police, he enlists a friend to help him clear his name by capturing this new Cat.<br /><br />To do that, he masquerades as an American tourist, and gets to know pretty oil heiress Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly) and her mother. But when the Stevens jewels are stolen, Frances brings the cops down on Robie -- and now he is more desperate than ever to find the Cat, because he suspects it's an old friend...<br /><br />Hitchcock was in fine form with \\"To Catch a Thief,\\" especially since he had two great actors in the mix. Granted this isn't one of his more insightful or suspenseful movies, but it captures a sense of sly wit and fun instead.<br /><br />If \\"To Catch A Thief\\" has a problem, it's that astute viewers will be able to guess who the  Cat is after about a half hour, maximum. But fortunately viewers can be distracted by Hitchcock's knack for razor-sharp dialogue (\\"What do you say?\\" \\"My only comment would be highly censorable\\") and double entendres (during an intimate lunch, Francie asks, \\"You want a leg or a breast?\\").<br /><br />It's also gorgeous to behold -- he entire movie is bathed in the golden Riviera sun, with lots of swimming, fast car chases, elaborate costume balls, and ornate hotels. But Hitchcock winds it up with a genuinely tense rooftop chase, complete with wrestling and gunshots.<br /><br />Grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life. Kelly is also quite good as an heiress who is less prim than she appears; John Williams and Jessie Royce Landis have fun supporting roles as a \\"veddy veddy English\\" insurance man and a shrewd rich woman.<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is a warm, sumptuous piece of classic film, with great dialogue and even better acting. Fun, stylish little mystery./> <br />Grant is a bit grizzled (and VERY overtanned) here, but still dapper and charming enough for Robie, a thief with principles and a taste for the good life.

B000002IJO|4.0|Beau Hill's production may have made this album sound a bit slick, but regardless, it's shows a band at the top of their game with tight musicianship and hook-laden songwriting skills.  It's not in my opinion the best album in the Ratt catalog, but it's still a solid effort.  The guitar interplay between Warren DiMartini and Robbin Crosby is always interesting to hear, even if the overall sound could have been a bit more raw -- kind of like on Ratt's debut EP and first full-length LP.  Still, if you're a die-hard Ratt fan, this album will find a way into your collection.

0711986746|5.0|Peter Freestone was Freddie Mercury's personal assistant from 1979 until Freddie's death in 1991.  In that time, Peter found himself in the midst of many interesting scenarios, many of which are chronicled in his book.  Peter's detailed account of the layout of Garden Lodge (Freddie's palatial home in the Kensington section of London) is especially noteworthy.  Peter went around the world with Freddie, experienced many tours, witnessed many recording sessions and video shoots, met many people who came and went in Freddie's life, and was even with Freddie during his declining years.  One can tell his loyalty to Freddie was steadfast.  Even though I favor Jim Hutton's book over all other books written about Freddie Mercury, this one still gets my stamp of approval, and I would still recommend it.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|...Meaning you can't easily pin him down. Yet between Scorsese's excellent documentary & Dylan's own Chronciles (Vol.1) this is as close a revealing display of 'who'/'what' Dylan is, and how that means different things to everyone interested in him and his art. I think the film brilliantly explores the facts, myths, contrivances, and oh yeah, impact the man's music and the path it cut through American culture and beyond. His impact IS so immense that it's easy to forget that he's just a man with a guitar/piano, a pen/typewriter, scraps of paper and cigarettes who has somehow been able to filter the complexities of humanity - be it love, anger, fear, outrage, compassion, sarcasm, loneliness, hope and humor via deceptively simple music and incredible poetry. He is a mirror, but not always the reflection of that mirror. As he sang in 'The Man in Me' (New Morning) \\"The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen/But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine\\". Still, Dylan is always an open book to anyone - whether or not you are of his generation, ignored him at the time this film explores, were born after this era (I was born in early 1968 in Rochester - a day's drive from his base at the time) or you have only recently discovered him. That is a hallmark of great art and a great artist - there's always something different you find everytime you tap into it. <br /> <br />Scorsese's research into his subject is excellent - from interviews (starting with Dylan himself) to contemporaries both alive and gone (Ginsberg, Van Ronk), thoughtfully plucked film footage including from 'Eat The Document'(including some outtakes(?)) not surprising since Scorsese as a young man edited both Pennebaker's film of the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967 and the documentary of Woodstock. There are many revealing moments, too numerous to list here and many more questions raised about the relevence of the artist to late-twentieth century, cold-war era culture. <br /><br />The pace is perfect, the threads many and artfully woven together. And stands up well to repeated viewing as a result. However, I take one star away because a discussion/exploration of the apex of his gradually frenzied pace and output - 'Blonde On Blonde' is *completely* omitted. I'm still scratching my head about that one. The record that best illustrates the genius and contradictions of the end of the era the film look at isn't even given a passing mention! Why? Not particularly interested? Had to cut any segment on it out to make the original TV broadcast time limit? Having said that, this is my sole disappointment with what otherwise is a fruitful and fascinating attempt to nail down the droplet of genius that was/is Robert Allen Zimmerman/Bob Dylan.
B0007P3582|1.0|Okay, here's the deal...when 50 first dropped `In da Club' I was impressed.  In fact all the singles off `Get Rich of Die Tryin' impressed me.  To this day the phrase \\"what up gangsta\\" remains part of my vocabulary.  So needless to say I was awaiting 50's follow-up with moderately high expectations, and that's what made the complete package such a let down.  The single `Candy Shop' became a phenomenon, and it was nice to see Olivia come out of hiding (not like 50 really let her do much) but other than that the rest of the album is a complete waste.  It's funny how an album boasting 22 tracks with no interludes can produce little to no hits.  I'm sure the radio DJ's would argue that statement saying that songs like `Disco Inferno' and `Piggy Bank' got plenty of radio time but that doesn't mean anything.  With his sophomore album 50 comes off silly, repetitive and simple.  The beats are weak, the lyrics are stupid and the content is just the same recycled garbage over and over again.  We know you hate every rapper more famous than you, we know you're incapable of a serious relationship, we know you like sex with as many different women as possible, we know you like to shoot people, you like money (who doesn't) and you do drugs...but couldn't you think of something, anything else to rap about?  At least he closes the album with `Hate it or Love It' featuring the members of G-Unit with some talent.

032147404X|5.0|I really enjoy Scott Kelby. Everything in this book is useful and made me purchase two more of his instructive publications.    It is precisely because of his sense of humor that he is successful...I firmly believe that. Even on my worst days I find humor valuable. The fact that he is one helleva teacher is not a bad thing either. Highly recommended!
B000I2J79K|5.0|for all you fans that like classic rock what can be a better DVD than this...Chicago & EW&F . This  DVD is absolutely amazing.

The sound and picture is absolutely supurb. A truly TOP notch Classic dvd from 2 of the best LEGENDS of music in the business.. DO NOT miss this...
1591391105|5.0|It is all to easy in a new job to launch in with what we think are clear mandates, work with vigor and enthusiasm to turn them into plans that we think will benefit the company and the people who work for us only to realize that the glittering darkness at the end of our launch silo is not a starry night sky but a wall embedded with wreckage to which we will shortly add. \\"The First 90 Days...\\" explains the challenges that we can encounter, which are most likely for each of four types of situations, and what we can do to keep them from becoming bricks in that wall.<br /><br />I won't make another job move without re-reading this book and analyzing the new situation as it suggests. It provides a good framework for understanding the type of situations one can move into. It has checklists of things to focus on and questions to ask by situation type and time frame starting before the first day and on through the first 90 days. I particularly liked the \\"Conversations to have with your new boss\\". Not only does Watkins describe the things that we as newcomers and our bosses need to have a clear understanding of but he provides a framework of several conversations and how and when to initiate them in order to facilitate the understanding. I highly recommend it for any position change.
B000002H92|5.0|Double CD, featuring the original/official \\"Absolutely Live\\" [see my review on that album elsewhere] integral on one disc (with the exception of the Ray Manzarek sung Willy Dixon classic \\"Close to You\\" which has been shifted to the other disc) and on the second disc the complete \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" and \\"Alive she Cried\\" with an exceptional fine \\"The End\\", which outside this package is not availble. This gives you a wealth of songmaterial, wellknown studioalbumtracks but surely even more songs, written by the Doors or others, which didn't appear on any of the 6 regular albums. I addition of long versions of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and \\"Light my Fire\\" (with Morrisons \\"Graveyard Poem\\" interlude) there is the Them classic \\"Gloria\\" in The Doors own characteristic vein, you hardly can say this is by Van Morrison/Them, and another Willy Dixon crack \\"Red Rooster\\" (already famous by the Rolling Stones) with John Sebastion from Lovin Spoonful on harmonica (like he did on the studioversion of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\"). Also appears a premature \\"W.A.S.P. (Texas Radio and the Big Beat) which at that time was a work in progress, the definitive version can be found on the final studioalbum \\"L.A. Woman\\". All in al these performances show you how good a liveband The Doors were. This in total makes it a must have for Doors fans and good music lovers alike. One of the best concertregistrations that can be found. Therefore strongly recommended.
B000JSI7AI|1.0|Seriously, this movie really sucks. No, I am NOT one of those gay hating baptist (if you want to be gay cool whatever) but I am a sane enough individual to admit that this movie was completely a gay parade of nonsense. The plot was in my opinion absolutely boring and idiotic. This is the message I got from this movie, \\"When your atop a mountain and your all alone or your married it's okay to screw your buddy, because it's okay to be gay.\\" Honestly, come on! You have to be honest with yourselves. This movie was just sad in a way that makes you wish you wouldn't have wasted your time. I was hoping to see a beautiful love story that would have helped me understand the love and connection gay people feel. Will and Grace demonstrates a better example. The two men in this movie cheated on their wives and were sex addicts. And if people think that is the greatest movie of all time then they are really delusional.
B000002HNR|5.0|The one and only official live-album released in between \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"L.A. Woman\\" albums, this shows the Doors at it very best. They were not a middle of the roadband who played each night a greatest hits show but varied their setlist as often as possible and did not only play wellknown songs of their albums, on the contrary. Looking on the songlist on this album it shows more songs outside their studioalbums. To begin with a dynamite McDaniel classic \\"Who Do You Love\\" with the same sometimes weird lyrics as James  Morrison used to write, to a medley which has \\"Loves Hides\\", a short but interesting track, not available on any or the regular albums. The same goes for the beautiful \\"Universal Mind\\", reminiscent of the \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" album, and the even stunning \\"Build Me a Woman\\", which is more from \\"The Doors\\" album but nevertheless doesn't appear on any of them. Further comes \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" in its long form as it is used to be but neither on any album released (that is until the 2003 compilation \\"Legacy\\" and the 2006 box \\"Perception\\"), from which the lyrics are printed inside the \\"Waitin for the Sun\\" album because of the song \\"Not to touch the Earth\\" which is a part of the mentioned longtrack, overall an outstanding performance (comparible to that on \\"The Doors Box\\" set, the \\"Live in New York\\" disc) and - oh surprise - the Ray Manzarek sung Willy Dixon classic \\"Close to You\\" (on the \\"In Concert\\" package switched to the second disc), somewhat comparible to the L.A.Woman outtake \\"(If You Need Meat) Don't Go Further\\", also by Dixon and sung by Manzarek. And last but not least \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\\", which preludes a heavy metal version of \\"Break on Through (To the other side)\\" with stunning guitar work by Robbie Krieger. Closer \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is also fabulous. The midsection is dominated by a long version of \\"When the Music is over\\", the audience was clearly having trouble with something or someone and the singer shows his annoyance andtreathens to stop the show or play only one repeating note by Manzarek, with which the audience give in and the song evolves to a real eruption. Many acts have released timeless live recordings, this is definite one of them. Superb, it really gives you an idea how a Doors performance could have been and gives you the feeling that you were there. Highly recommended!
B0002O7XW2|5.0|exelente pelicula, altamente recomendable para los estudiosos en la materia de Carpenter y Stephen Sking felicidades por tenerla a la venta gracias!
B000056JYC|5.0|The guitar playing alone would make this album worth having.  The pure rock and roll would make this worth having.  Combined, this is an album you must have. <br /> <br />It may not the greatest live album ever (I think it is Warren Zevon's \\"Stand in the Fire\\"), but it's pretty damned close. <br /> <br />Not only \\"...an honorary member of San Francisco Society...\\" but all society, Mr. Peter Frampton...in all his glory. <br /> <br />Enjoy
B000HWZ61Y|4.0|The 2nd cd is what many fans have been waiting for--to have all the singles in one place!  Still, the cd is too pricey, seeing that many double cds now only cost about 18 dollars. Still, how can you resist?  I give it a four b/c of the price.  A 5 otherwise!!!
B00003CXPD|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.Being an expat Brit.I understand the varied accents and nuances, am a fan of Julie Walters and was thoroughly entertained.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens is perhaps the best Action/Sci-fi flick ever made.<br /><br />I'll never forget seeing Aliens in the theater on the day that it was released back in 1986. My expectations were for a film that mirrored Alien in the sense that the sets would be kept dark, you'd not really get a good look at the creatures, and the looks that you did get would be puppets or men in Alien suits.<br /><br />But, man, what an exhilarating scene in Aliens when Michael Biehn (Cpl. Hicks) pushed up that ceiling tile to reveal an army of aliens crawling toward him. Then as they dropped through the ceiling into the room...that was some intense movie making and holds true to today.<br /><br />A lot of movies that you watched pre 1990 you may remember as awesome, only to be let down by a refreshed viewing in the current day where \\"it just doesn't seem as cool or scary anymore for some reason\\".  But rest assured, Aliens is not one of those let downs.<br /><br />Aliens Director James Cameron is perhaps one of the best writer/director/producers in the business. He is the master of bringing realism to fantasyland. Terminator (T1, 2 & 3), True Lies, Titanic, Point Break...all movies...just like Aliens...that once you've seen 'em, you never forget 'em.<br /><br />Be sure to choose the Director's Extended Version play mode of the Aliens DVD; it's one of the rare Director's cuts that adds substance rather than fluff.<br /><br />Side note: If you're looking to acquire the all of the 2-disk Alien series (Alien, Aliens, Alien3 and Alien 4...Alien v Predator not included), Amazon often has the box set \\"Quadrilogy\\" at about half the price that you'd end up paying for all 4 individually.
0895260131|4.0|The book is an excellent primer to the Islamic religion and why Muslims are acting the way they are today in the world.  It gives you history about Muhammad and compares his teaching with Jesus as well as the history and teachings of the Islamic religion in general.  <br /> <br />The book is full of citations to the Qur'an to support the author's statements.  It is a fancinating book and I could only read about 10 to 15 pages at a time since it made me stop and think about the author's statements and compare them to what is happening in the Middle East and in the Muslim communities around the world. <br /> <br />If you know little or nothing about Islam and Muhammad and want some insights into what is happening in the Middle East and the religious violence, this book is an excellent start.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Movie was great. Shipping was very fast. Price was very good.
B000H5V8DG|1.0|I first pre-ordered this item during the summer, and was very happy when it arrived weeks before the December 23rd shipping estimate.  Yet when I opened the box, I was disappointed to see that they had used cardboard sleeves to keep the DVDs in.  Even worse, they had a rough cardboard edge directly in the middle of the DVD. <br /> <br />Due to the packaging, the DVDs shifted around during shipping, and several were scratched.  Approximately 5 would start freezing while being played - but not until a good part of an episode! <br /> <br />I contacted Amazon, who sent me another box, and allowed me to pick and choose between the better DVDs.  I managed to get a complete set that works, with minor scratches, but I'm afraid that storing them inside the Rambaldi DVD sleeves will just scratch them further. <br /> <br />Great idea, but the packaging is horrible.  You'll spend more time trying to assemble a working set, then it's worth.
074356619X|3.0|I don't think I heard anything that would qualify as a \\"secret\\", as this power of positive thinking stuff has been around for a long time.  But a new pep rally for self confidence every so often, is a good thing.  Some reviewers have been miffed that it didn't talk about God.  Actually, that it talked about being your own advocate in goal setting and going after what you want in a positive way was what I liked.
B000002LHX|5.0|Bought this CD for my husband, 1 because he loves Batman and 2 he requested it on his Christmas list!! He loves it. It's a great CD if you love the soundtrack from Batman (with Jack Nicholson) and you are a big fan of Prince.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|It's hard to get people who've never seen the show to take it seriously. \\"Veronica Mars\\" is kind of like \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" in that way. However, when some people happen to watch with you because they have nothing better to do, it's a good idea to have the DVDs handy because they will definitely want to borrow them. <br /> <br />There are a standard set of extras for a TV show on DVD: deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes, and the aforementioned gag reel, but they are noticeably lacking commentary, the one thing I would have expected from Rob Thomas and crew.
0553804367|3.0|In general the book covers big ideas to vague.  For a person with a science background it leaves much to be desired with the details it discusses.  A brief history of time is a much better read.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Love the story, the book, the musical and now the movie!!! <br />And love Gerard Butler !!!
B000I0QL82|5.0|It's my favorite all time movie. I watch it every Thanksgiving night as I set up  my Christmas tree - love it love it love it!!!

B000HBK3MM|4.0|True, people may have put her hype to an unrealistic proportion before the album's release, but truth be told, \\"Corinne Bailey Rae\\" is a solid and nearly exceptional debut record. Corinne has a beautiful voice and soothing music to go as the soundtrack with it. Being as this is just the beginning, I can only wonder what's coming next from her. It succeeds in being melodic/soulful, sunny, and heart-warming at times. She's pretty talented, and I think if you have taste for soul, jazz, pop, pop-rock, and blues, you'll enjoy this album. And perhaps you're not usually even a follower of those types of music. Me, I tend to be an alternative and electronic rock type guy, but am sold on this record. <br /> <br />There are many highlights. \\"Like a Star\\" is a wonderful way to open the album, and the punch continues with \\"Enchantment\\" and the big, feel-good single \\"Put Your Records On.\\" I tend to like the first half more, which is the case with many CD's I own, but there's still moments there, like \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" and \\"I'd Like to,\\" which actually reminds me of some moments on Lauryn Hill's solo debut album (although as an artist, she's got more in common with India.Arie). <br /> <br />It is highly recommended, and if you feel like a lot of music out today is garbage, I suggest you check out some of the actual quality stuff, like this great release.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is a true CLASSIC! Belongs in your library. Re-live an era that is gone but this makes it not forgotten.
0465011047|5.0|&#34;Aquariums of Pyongyang&#34; is one of the first books I read about the experience of people in North Korea. It details a young man's family's life in the North Korean gulag. It is one of several recent biographies that show the sheer violence and absurdity of everyday life in North Korea.<br /><br />The book begins with Chol-hwan Kang's life as a middle-class resident of Pyongyang. The family was thrown into the gulag without reason. There, they suffered years and years of hardship, which Kang details in this book. Kang escaped the country through his own cunning and then made it to safety through a network of like-minded people fighting for North Korean citizens.<br /><br />This book offers something that human rights reports cannot: the author's own heart-wrenching story. It is not filled with statistics and numbers, but it is filled with family and feelings. This makes &#34;The Aquariums of Pyongyang&#34; unforgettable.
0893860220|5.0|Most of the reviews here praise this book for what it is. I will try to review it on the basis of whom it will appeal to.    Regardless of your belief system, if you feel that worshiping is a meaningless exercise, but are still curious about understanding if there is something beyond the cause-and-effect realm we inhabit, you have come to the right place. Am not referring to an uninformed iconoclastic attitude towards organized religion but to a healthy dose of skepticism born out of thought and enquiry. Surely, in a world with so much pain and where genocides still occur (as in Sudan), millions of people attending places of worship and chanting prayers does seem foolish, if not outright delusional.    `I am that' introduces you to the concept of `I', the one beyond the idea of an individual self and the body. One of the most attractive features of this idea is that it stands on it own and is beyond all dogma and religion and does not need any membership or subscription (what a relief!). Despite what the Maharaj says about his concepts being so simple that anyone can comprehend them, this is a book that probably cannot be understood in its entirety by an average reader (like myself). No problem, it will still give you a new perspective at the deeper meaning of life.     As an accompanying and a more practical book, I also recommend `Phantoms in the brain' by the neurologist VS Ramachandran. Here, the author describes the function of the various components of the brain through easy to understand experiments and dwells on the idea of consciousness. While science is no where close to discovering how the idea of a self is formed, there are tantalizing teases that it is created by the various components of brain acting together. If this is so, it only serves to prove what the Maharaj and various other realized masters like Sri Ramana have been saying all along. There must be something beyond the self to which it (the self) must wrap around.
0689877692|5.0|The pop-ups in this book are extremely well done.  I am impressed by their intricacy.  It is not a challenge to find the dot, but that's hardly the fun of this book. I would not let any child near it though.
0689865384|5.0|Besides, The Giver, this is my favorite young adult book. Referred to me by a librarian, I was hesitant by the title itself. But Westerfield delivers more than just an intriguing plot, he also delivers a powerful message of our world today. This book brings on so many unspoken issues that we see as problems, but are truly trivial issues in our day and age. I love how he incorporates it all into a futuristic and believable plot. This is a classic in the making (like 1984 and The Giver), and if you loved those books, you'll love this one, too. This is, by far, the best of the three in the trilogy.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Best Ever!!!!!!!!. Powerfull dynamics. More unusual instruments. Repeat viewing a must. Now when playing the CD you can visualize the exact people and instruments being used. Yanni has outdone himself with this one.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This may be my favorite music DVD of all time. The unfortunate circumstance being a requiem for a great man. Maybe one of the most altruistic \\"celebrities\\" to have ever graced us with his presence (though I'm sure he would be embarassed by such accolades).     That said, this double disc set is a marvel at every turn. Even from the first disc, in an Indian Orchestra performance conducted by Ravi Shankar's daughter Anoushka you know this is \\"the stuff\\".     I have little, if any, knowledge of Indian music. At first it is a little difficult to comprehend, after a short few moments, I was able to, \\"turn off my mind, relaxed, and floated downstream\\" (sorry, about that), and I really began to enjoy the almost mantra-like sounds of the music.     On to the second disc. This I knew was the meat and potatoes of the collection, the reason I'd bought the thing on the first place.    From the opening notes of \\"I Want to Tell You\\", this band was in command of the songs. And what a performance! I could easily break them all down  and cover every nuance of every tune. But I won't.    Highlights:    Gary Brooker - Old Brown Shoe.   An amazing \\"reading\\" of a somewhat forgotten gem, His voice fits the song perfectly.    Joe Brown - \\"That's The Way it Goes\\" from \\"Gone Troppo\\".   Had never heard it before this, and this mid-tempo rocker (with a not too subtle storyline) forced me to go out and buy the original.    Ringo Starr - \\"Photograph\\"   One of the most poignant of all the performances. George had written this for Ringo's first solo record. The words originally about a lost love, now about a lost friend. And Ringo sounds emotionally lost while singing it.     Billy Preston - \\"My Sweet Lord\\".   GOOD----NESS!!!!     This is THE reason for buying this disc. PERIOD. He wrings EVERY ounce of emotion from this tune, without beating you over the head with it. This version will bring you to tears. An absolute classic.    So, there you have it.  It's great.  It's a must have.  Why are you still sitting there?
B00005JMXX|1.0|The science is deplorable and the acting is worse. If the world should end the day after tomorrow, and you haven't yet seen this movie, consider yourself lucky!
074356619X|5.0|Loved it Very positive If you liked What the Bleep you will enjoy this.
B000093OU8|5.0|So, I finally picked up a copy of this classic album.  I literally haven't heard it since I owned the cassette version more than 15 years ago.  This album is every bit as good as I remember, if not better.  The guitar work is simply stellar and the songwriting is top-notch as there is not a bad song on this disc.  \\"Wild Frontier\\" is a rarity in that the 12\\" versions are often better than the original album tracks.
B000020617|5.0|Probably the only album that I can honestly say does not contain a weak song on the entire cd. <br /> <br />An incredible combination of lyrics, vocals, electric guitar, and drums that accompany each other perfectly...which seems a difficult task in this music genre.  For me personally, it often seems that in the albums of other bands, either the vocals, guitar, or drums override the other two...but not in this album. <br /> <br />Dave Grohl has outdone himself (yet again).  It's the musical version of caffeine and an electric album to work out to.  Taylor Hawkins' drums are solid, powerful, and clean (listen to the first 20 seconds of Gimme Stitches and you will see what I mean). <br /> <br />Although \\"Learn to Fly\\" is probably the most recognized track (with an incredibly funny music video to match)...most of the other songs are equally memorable and high energy and all are worth listening to again and again. <br />
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I enjoy this cd immensley. The 5.1 sound is incredible on my theatre system. The songs intertwined is really interesting and gives you the listener a new Beatles experience. The cheering crowds from the Beatlemania days add a certain historical 1960s essence. This latest Beatles release is helmed by George Martin. Who has done a fine job on the remastering of the original Beatle tapes. The linear notes are very informative explaining more in depth about the \\"Love\\" project. This cd is definintly a trip through the Beatles remarkable musical career. I praise Capital and George Martin for a beautiful Beatles remastered cd. My only gripe and I know there are countless Beatles and rock fans that will agree with me on this \\" Why doesnt Capital records or who ever is responsible remaster in the same quality as \\"One and \\"Love\\" the whole Beatles catalouge. The reason is money. Since 1987 Capital has released the Beatles complete catalouge but not remastered as these releases are flat sounding,  and mostly in mono. Big deal another Beatles release of old songs we have heard  countless times but still enjoy. \\"Yellow Submarine\\",\\"One\\"and \\"Love\\"  are nice remastered releases but clearly dodge the real issue of Capital or whoever, releasing these new Beatle compilations to make loads of money instead of remastering the whole Beatles catolouge from \\"Meet The Beatles\\" to \\"Past Masters Volumes 1 and 2\\". Once they remaster the whole Beatles catolouge, than these new Beatle compilations would be nice to add to our remastered Beatles catolouge. Clearly Capital is just pumping out these different Beatles releases (some I have not mentioned) along with the twenty year plus unremastered Beatles cds to make money. That is all good, said and done, PLEASE CAPITAL OR WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CURRENT BEATLES UNREMASTERED BEATLES CATOLOUGE, STOP WITH ALL THESE RIDICULOUS MONEY MAKING BEATLE COMPILATIONS AND GIVE THE FANS WHAT THEY REALLY WANT. A COMPLETE 24 BIT OR 5.1 DTS, REMASTERED BEATLES AMERICAN RELEASE FROM \\"MEET THE BEATLES\\" TO \\"PAST MASTERS VOLUMES 1-2\\", ALL 16 BEATLES CDS COVERING ALL THEIR COMMERCIAL RELEASES AND SINGLES, THERE IS THE 16 CD SET OF THE BEATLES RELEASES ALREADY AVAILABLE, BUT I WILL NOT BUY IT FOR IT IS NOT REMASTERED AND DOES SOUND FLAT. PLEASE REMASTER THIS SAME SET. THAT IS ALL I ASK OF CAPITAL. \\"Love\\" is a highly recommended and an enjoyable Beatles listen. IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF THE LATE JOHN WINSTON LENNON(1940-1980)   \\"IMAGINE\\", HAVING THE WHOLE BEATLES CATOLOUGE REMASTERED. WOULDNT THAT BE BETTER THAN THIS NEW BEATLES MONEY MAKING COMPILATION OF \\"LOVE\\"........................UPDATED--2/17/2007--PS. I HAVE READ WERE APPLE, CAPITAL IS SUPPOSED TO RERELEASE THE WHOLE REMASTERED BEATLES CATALOUGE IN 2007. THIS WILL BE THE SAME CATALOUGE RELEASED IN 1987, YOU WILL HAVE TO UPGRADE TO THESE NEW REMASTERED BEATLES CDS. THE 1987 BEATLE CD RELEASES ALL REMASTERED IN 2007 AND IT TOOK A MERE TWENTY YEARS. LOL!!!!!!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|When \\"Pearl Harbor\\" came out three years after \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", I was hoping for a similar dramatic blockbuster that infused admirable and likable characters into an action-filled, heart-tugging, and well-directed/produced movie.  Instead (and how can I articulately put this?) well, quite frankly, it sucked.    The acting was extremely poor in the lead roles (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale).  Even with the number of high-quality actors in it (i.e., Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Josh Hartnett, etc.) they were not enough to save this film.    The special effects, however, were quite remarkable and one of the few bright spots in this cinematic bummer.  Unfortunately, these first-rate effects didn't make up for the awful acting.
B0002ZXCY4|5.0|Immerse yourself in this musical journey! It is nothing short of brilliant and spectacular. As an artist, I find the music of Ayreon and the stories it tells quite inspiring. Anyone who is a fan of metal, progressive rock and sci-fi and fantasy can't help but fall inlove with this album. It follows in the very grand tradition of Jeff Wayne's musical version of the War of the Worlds quite nicely. In fact, I believe it overshadows it in the process. The compositions are strong without being overpowering and lend great depth to the stories being told. Arjen Lucassen has quite a talent for assembling a great cast for his projects. This is no exception.<br /><br />This does remind me quite a bit of Dream Theater in the level of artistry and the overall sound. This is an almost symphonic level of music and flawless blending of styles that isn't often heard.
B00011RPB0|5.0|*** Slight spoiler at the end of this review ***    The acting and directing in this movie are remarkable.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson very convincingly portray two lonely souls who meet each other in the bar of an upscale hotel in the middle of ultra fast-paced Tokyo.    The acting is quite subtle with so many wonderful facial expressions used by both actors to communicate feelings to the audience.  The characters become real.  This is, perhaps in large part, due to the audience's ability to easily see Murray as that aging, cynical movie star who grudgingly travels to Japan to make a healthy sum of money starring in a Japanese whiskey commercial.  His brilliant, comedic talent is used sparingly, yet very effectively in several, low-key, yet hilarious scenes.    Roger Ebert beautifully describes the final scene of the movie (in his September 2003 review):  \\"I loved the moment near the end when Bob runs after Charlotte and says something in her ear, and we're not allowed to hear it.  We shouldn't be allowed to hear it. It's between them, and by this point in the movie, they've become real enough to deserve their privacy. Maybe he gave her his phone number. Or said he loved her.

B00005K3O4|4.0|It's hard to describe this movie - campy, yes, strange, definitely unsettling.  But it's the John Massari score that stands out for me.  I'm pleased to see that the soundtrack for Killer Klowns is now available.  It's worth viewing for the music alone!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|A great production but with some miss  conceptions  <br />For instance the Aral  sea Kazakhstan was not dried doe to de global warming as suggested in the film but through the diversion of the main rivers that feed it to provide water for cotton cultivation in arid Soviet Central Asia.  <br />
B00005JPAM|4.0|I really liked this movie and Helen Mirren -- as usual -- does a fantastic job of portraying the Queen and her royally dysfunctional family as complex anachronisms.  Ms Mirren absolutely deserves the kudo's she has received and could easily capture an oscar for her performance.  She is definitely aided by the makeup and costumes which also deserve mention as being outstanding.  Several things stand out in this movie which I felt served to capture the royal family, its isolation, its dislike of Diana (and why), and its weird family dynamics.  The line \\"Diana is even more annoying dead than she was alive\\" I thought captured their real dislike of her as a person.  Even more distrubing was the reaction the Queen had to the death of the stag versus her reaction to the death of Diana. Heart felt emotion for the stag, nothing for Diana.  The flap over the flag was a real indication of how this family is trapped by tradition and protocol, which is more important to them than people.  In fact this film, which may be close to the truth, shows that the royal family lives in a gilded cage constructed of tradition, protocol, slavish minions, and isolation from any real people.No one dares tell them the truth or to disturb the tranquility of their placid and unreal existence.  Clearly this is why Diana was so despised by them.  Diana was outgoing, hated the protocol, the stiffness and almost total lack of emotion, love, or family.  She was everything they hated but everything they needed.  Of course they really never understood that and even today they have little grasp of how outdated they are as an institution.  This is a totally dysfunctional family and you see Prince Charles as a grown man incapable of making his own decisions because he must get permission from the Queen.  Prince Phillip -- one minute he is husband and the next he is subject, but clearly he is the most isolated of all -- and likes it that way -- unless he doesn't get his way.  These are living anachronisms and Mirren manages to convey that even they are beginning to realize that.<br /><br />The Tony Blair character (Sheen) is well done and really shows the schizophrenic attitude the Brits have toward the Royal Family.  The PM of England is certainly one of the most powerful men in the world, yet we see him bowing and (gag) kneeling to kiss the hand of the sovereign.  It shows how he has the power but his power is fleeting while the royal family has the influence which remains as long as the monarchy exists.  Which the film clearly shows is on shaky ground due to the isolation of the royal family.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because I thought the cinematography was distracting at times and there were too many gratuitous shots of Diana, but Mirren's performance is well worth the price of admission.nd Mirren manages to convey that even they are beginning to realize that.   <br /> <br />The Tony Blair character (Sheen) is well done and really shows the schizophrenic attitude the Brits have toward the Royal Family.

B00005JP9V|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />One of these days, some innovative filmmaker is going to make a movie set in a future where the skies are crystalline blue, governments treat their citizens with decency and respect, and people live in relative harmony with both technology and one another. But until that time we have \\"Children of Men,\\" yet another dystopian vision of what life might be like in the not-too-distant future - and, as usual, it ain't a pretty picture.<br /><br />Based on a novel by P.D. James, \\"Children of Men\\" takes place in the year 2027, a time in which the world has been thrown into chaos by war and disease, and the entire human race has been infertile for 18 years. Only Merry Olde England has, for some reason, been able to escape the generalized destruction (though not the infertility). In a bid to protect the nation from hostile outside elements, the government has begun to round up all its illegal aliens, locking them into cages and deporting them off the island (when it isn't slaughtering them outright).<br /><br />The overrated Clive Owens plays a Ministry of Energy bureaucrat who, much against his will, finds himself caught up in a plot to transport a young pregnant woman - the world's first since 2009 - to a place of safety so she can hopefully help to restart the otherwise doomed human race (although one wonders how a single child in the world will effectuate that outcome).<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" has much to recommend it. It has a strong sense of time and place, with a look that is just right for its subject matter. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has drained most of the color out of the picture, and director Alfonso Cuaron has filmed the scenes with a great deal of immediacy and excitement. Cuaron certainly knows how to gin up the suspense and to make us feel like participants in the action.<br /><br />But the film is less successful at exploring the profound implications of its theme. James has come with an unusually intriguing premise - just what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. Instead, the movie turns into a surprisingly conventional \\"chase\\" movie, with characters running for their lives from hostile parties amid a ceaseless hail of explosions and bullets. Just why is it that dystopian dramas - from \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" to \\"Logan's Run\\" to \\"The Island\\" to \\"Minority Report\\" to \\"The Imposter\\" to \\"Paycheck,\\" to name just a handful - all feel the need to adhere to this tired narrative formula? Every so often, the film zeroes in on its theme, yielding, by far and away, its most effective moments: people sobbing uncontrollably as they watch a news story relating the sudden death of the world's youngest person; an art collector amassing many of the world's greatest sculptures and paintings even though he knows that in less that a hundred years there will be nobody left to appreciate them; a former midwife, sitting in an abandoned schoolroom, recounting with soul-wrenching sadness the day she realized children would no longer be gracing the world with their presence; combatants momentarily stopping their gunfire to stare awestricken at a newborn babe. We yearn for more of these psychologically astute and insightful moments, but, alas, this is not to be, as Cuaron and his team of writers pour on the action scenes pretty much at the expense of everything else.<br /><br />Owens, Michael Caine (in the annoyingly stereotypical role of an aging eccentric hippie) and Julianne Moore are the \\"name\\" players in the cast, but the most powerful performances come from Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant woman and Pam Ferris as the person assigned to be her midwife.<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" is a good film that could have been a great one were it not redolent of so many likeminded movies that have come before it.ust what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it.

B000803PKY|5.0|I don't know what I was hoping to find when I got this dvd. But whatever it was, I was left with the feeling I had found something even more precious. It's the odd glimpse of genius at work - \\"yeah, we could do it like that\\", the depth you reach as he shares every breath with you, then takes yours away. And that's just the music. Most of all it's Jackson's intensity, passion and vulnerability exposed in the photos. He is surrounded by great people - musicians, friends, adoring fans. And yet he is alone, empty, the grail for unquenchable thirst. You want to be his fountain. Take another look at this beautiful man. Get to see where the music comes from.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell is not for everyone.  I had my two book clubs read it, and most didn't finish the book.  After the first one, I explained what the reader had to understand and look for in reading the book.   <br /> <br />The format is highly unusual, but if the reader persists, there is understanding and growth.  Both my husband and I enjoyed the experience and recommend it highly to others.  It is exciting to see an author willing to expand our horizons.
B0000025T6|5.0|The story of \\"Nebraska\\" is well-known to Springsteen fans as he slipped this brooding, low-tech solo album in between two blockbuster sets with the E Street Band, \\"The River\\" and \\"Born in the USA\\".  The characters here are reminiscent of \\"The River\\", but with an eye and ear directed back an album to \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\".  For the most part, Bruce's vocals epitomize what my choir director means when she talks about singing quietly, but still intensely.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"Atlantic City\\", \\"Johnny 99\\", \\"Used Cars\\" (which I can relate to--our second car when I grew up was always a \\"junker\\"--and we couldn't dream of the winning the lottery to replace it), \\"Open All Night\\" (anyone who's driven on the New Jersey Turnpike at night can relate to it), and \\"Reason to Believe\\" (a live-action semi-hymn)--almost no intersection with those of the Amazon editorial reviewer, but I think that's testimony to the overall quality of the album.  The title track sets the tone well, but it's just too dark to be considered a favorite.  Still, five stars for a courageous, sincere and successful effort by The Boss.
0156027321|5.0|For me, the best books show us worlds we could never visit ourselves, lives we could never imagine.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is extraordinary, and one of those books that did that for me.<br /><br />And stay with it:  When I read it, I found the first quarter of the book beautifully written, but it seemed a bit meandering.  But trust me, it's not.  The beginning section is truly the spiritual setup for the book, and provides the boy with everything he needs as he attempts to survive the terrible adventure that awaits him.<br /><br />By the time the book begins in earnest, with a fateful voyage and two characters -- Pi and Richard Parker -- trapped in amazing circumstances, the book is simply impossible to put down. The writing is beautiful, the characters are haunting and sympathetic, and it's all so real you can smell the saltwater, or feel the rumble of a tiger's purr.  The story surprises at every turn, not least in a quietly stunning moment near the end, when Pi tells a little story of his own.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is an incredible book, and one I recommend without hesitation.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Great series, just watch out for every cliff hanging ending.  It's hard to stop watching.  Can't wait for the season 3 DVD's.
0307237699|5.0|The Audacity of Hope is a five star read.  People of all parties should read this book, as Senator Obama speaks truth and intelligence and I feel has the makings of a great President. He points out the good and bad in both parties and just makes PLAIN sense.  I hope people will read this book to get a sense of what this man is all about.  He is the real deal and THE MAN in my opinion to lead this country in a better direction.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I just watched this movie on an overcast saturday afternoon.  I have been disillusioned with movies lately, they all seemed like a waste of time.  This wasn't.  I really enjoyed how smart this script was, the characters were believeable and there is an awesome surprise ending.

B000K7VHPU|4.0|This was a very good, very entertaining movie.  With all the technology we have today we have no doubt lost the fascination with illusion that Eisenheim's audiences marveled over.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the ending was rushed a bit.  Too much activity was placed in the last minutes of the film to allow for a complete and satisfactory explanation of the main element of the story, mainly, the mutual love of Eduard and the Countess.
0618680004|5.0|I absolutely adored this critique of religion by Richard Dawkins.  He is a preeminent scholar who backed up his arguments against the existence of God, or rather the probability of the existence of God, beautifully.<br /><br />Dawkins also made a compelling argument for the fact that religion is not simply a benign preference that one adopts; it can be and is indeed frequently used to justify sexism, homophobia, territorial disputes and futile, bloody wars.<br /><br />It seems politically correct nowadays to separate fundamentalist religions from the mainstream, in particular when we are talking about Muslims; however, Dawkins argues that all religion is a form of fanaticism because it's based on myth and compulsion.  He talks about how frequently we overlook the fact that suicide bombers truly believe that they will be rewarded in the hereafter for their heinous deeds.<br /><br />The only complaint that I, as an agnostic, would have about The God Delusion is that it offers no solace.  Dawkins seems to find comfort in science and the evolutionary theory but I don't and I don't imagine that a terminal cancer patient would either.  That's not to say that fear of mortality justifies a belief in a higher being whose presence we can't confirm -- it is to say that I understand why people embrace the concept even if it runs contrary to what we know scientifically.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald<br /><br />Ottawa, Ontario
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is what you expect from some of the most down to earth rockers, you will find out there.  They are committed to their craft and they do a wonderful job of executing it.  Kawn's vocals, how he pours himself into every song, so much power and passion.  Thomas's and Barry, if there were two gods of the strings, it would be theses guys, and Oliver, the haunting effects that roll from his keyboards, and Casey one of the most talented drummers its been my pleasure to see perform.  These guys bring so much energy and power to each and every song they perform. Patric Ullacus has a knack for capturing the best aspects of a show, I know the Seattle show was no were near the size of this one, but the energy and power was the same, and for that I have to that Patric for giving us something that will hold us over till they return to the northwest.  Thank you.
0743289412|3.0|Stephen King, master of suspense, put me to sleep with this long-winded tale about a grieving widow.  He placed way too much attention on the relationship between the woman and her husband, a former best-selling, well renowned author, and the woman's family, without setting a background or any other conflict or characters.<br /><br />I'm probably in the minority but I gave up reading after 100 pages because I found that the story was moving along at a snail's pace.  I could have been interested in the plot but it just didn't have enough action or development for me.<br /><br />Sigrid Macdonald<br /><br />Ottawa, Ontario
B000JVT1U0|5.0|Despite being plagued by production difficulties, budgetary problems and abysmal distribution (British Lion were unprepared for the film) Robin Hardy's directorial debut \\"The Wicker Man\\" is still with us and stronger than ever. Numerous DVD re-issues, soundtrack releases and even a bungled Hollywood remake makes the film remarkably persistent. An impressive feat for an unpretentious low budget British horror film. It's status as a horror film could be contested, such is the complexities of generic study. And with its very naturalised cinematography, numerous musical numbers and detective narrative it is apparent the film is a complex hybridity. Perhaps it is this very hybridity which has attracted such a devoted cult following. A number of films approached Christianity as an institution under threat in the 1970's, but none as insidiously and disturbing as this one. The film hinges on a great performance by Edward Woodward. He is a boorish, rude and arrogant man as he strolls around a community he has no place in. Pontificating and criticising, believing it to be a god given right. One would ordinarily celebrate the fate of such a repugnant man. But Woodward still elicits sympathy through a subtle and nuanced performance. It works so well because Christopher Lee produces an opposite performance, he is free and easy in the face of Howie's stiffness and repression. The film also benefits from a wonderfully intricate narrative courtesy of Anthony Shaffer which keeps the audience guessing to the devastating climax. A tremendous soundtrack of folk songs by Paul Giovanni adds authenticity and just the right atmosphere of creepiness. A high watermark that British horror has yet to reach again.<br /><br /> In terms of DVD US audiences might be better off importing the recent UK Region 2 edition, which contains both the 88 minute cut of the film and the 100 minute director's cut. The bonus disc also includes the excellent Mark Kermode documentary \\"Burnt Offerings\\", this effort by Anchor Bay isn't too bad though.fort by Anchor Bay isn't too bad though.

B000CNFC76|5.0|Great story and a well done movie. One of the finest moments in sports history. Imagine a match where Tiger Woods & Phil Mickelson and an unknown amateur ended up in a sudden death playoff and the amateur won (with a 10 year old for a caddy, BTW).    Great family entertainment. You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy it.  Buy the book also, you will enjoy it 10-fold if you liked the movie...
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This was one of them.  There are elements of this album that are empowering and there are elements that can make you feel that your life is small and fragile. It's flat out beautiful, it's not the same sound as I Brought You My Bullets but it's the same raw emotion, just evolved and that's a wonderful thing for those of us that have been fans since they've played VFW's in New Jersey.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I came upon this movie while switching channels.  I have seen this movie on tv but never really saw the whole thing.  This time around, I caught the movie in the beginning.  From then on, my eyes were stuck on the tv. I finally decided to buy the dvd.   <br />This is a great movie.  It is a great love story between lovers and families.  It was kind of long, but it went by pretty fast.  I was not a big fan of Brad Pitt.  But because of this movie, I am starting to warm up to him.  I have always been a big fan of Claire Forlani.  She was perfect for this part.  She is exceptionally beautiful.  Anthony Hopkins was superb as William Parrish.   <br />This movie is about whats important in life.  I think Death's and Susan's love story is one the best of all time.  I cried when Susan knew who he was, but she said he is still Joe.  I cried until the scene where she runs after her father and Death because the 2 men in her life is gone.  Then, I cried again when the sweet guy from the coffee shop came back and realized she has a second chance at love.   <br /> <br />This was great movie.  This movie is a classic.
B00005JLIU|5.0|This has everything - mystery, romance, slapstick comedy and a group of actors that stand the test of time!  Raspberries, dahling!
B000J103PC|5.0|I loved this movie.  I didnt think I would love it but I do.  I thought this movie was very funny.   <br /> <br />Meryl Streep was believable and hilarious as the boss from hell.  Anna Hathaway was wonderdul as Andrea Sachs.  Stanley Tucci was superb as the fashion expert and friend to Andrea.  Emily Blunt was great as Emily.  She was snobby towards Andrea but at the end she was jealous of Andrea's new position as Runway.   <br /> <br />I can not forget about Simon Baker as Christian Thompson.  He is hot and charming as Andrea's admirer.  He was not too confident, but he was still sexy.  It seemed like he geuninely wanted to help Andrea with her journalism goals but at the same time, he wanted more from her in a intimate way I guess.  I was looking forward to Andrea's and Christian's scenes in the movie.  I was actually rooting for them to get together and hoping that Andrea dumps Nate.  I was hoping to see Andrea and Christian meet again  and connect after the Paris trip.  It did seem like they like each other.   <br /> <br />I didnt like how Andrea's friends and boyfriend did not support her and her new job.  If they really cared for her, it would not matter how she dresses or who she works for.  It was her job. <br /> <br />Other than that, it was a great movie.  I can watch it over and over.
0307277887|2.0|Great story line, wonderful characters and setting, problem is, it is not written well at all!! Jeff Lindsay has a great imagination, but terrible writting ability, almost painful to read. If I had not watched the Showtime series and enjoyed it so much, I would not be able to read the book. Truth be told, I am having trouble with it regardless.
B000001ESF|5.0|With Rush's 2112 just passing it's 30th anniversary mark, the sound might seem dated to someone hearing it for the first time, but the guitar licks and explosive drums have made this release a classic that has stood the test of time. 2112 is like Rush's rock opera, and not far from comparison of The Who's Tommy or Jethro Tull's A Passion Play. The first half(or side 1)is a continuous epic piece with the concept being about the severe oppression and discovery of music. The second half are the standard, radio-like songs, most of which have Led Zeppelin qualities but still showcase Rush as they developed their sound of what they both liked and what was popular at the time. The songs grow on you from the first listen with the radio hit \\"A Passage to Bangkok,\\" \\"Lessons,\\" and \\"Something For Nothing,\\" all becoming favorites for the true Rush fan.

B00005T30L|3.0|Can you relate to the statement, \\"I can't relate to 99% of humanity\\" expressed by Seymour (Steve Buscemi), the 40-ish lonely guy and obsessive compulsive collector of 78 blues/ragtime records? If you can then you just might be one who moves within the shadows of existence much like the characters in the most appropriately titled, `Ghost World' released in '01.<br /><br />`Ghost World' is a somewhat grim but poignantly humorous tale dealing with that percentage of society that never fit into the mainstream of society. Whether you're young like Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) recently graduated from high school, middle-aged like Seymour (Buscemi), or the unnamed old man sitting on a bus bench in a location where the bus never stops anymore, they are all part of that disenfranchised group that we see but never really notice.<br /><br />While this film is considered a cult classic by many I have to admit it fell short of my expectations. What really worked well in this movie was the Seymour character played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson may have received top billing and they do deliver fine performances, but Buscmi is the real star of this production.<br /><br />Good, but not great. My Rating: 3 ½ Stars.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|There are two types of movies that cast a nutty crazy family. There is the one type where you are glad they're not your family, but you can still appreciate and like them. <br />Then there's this family in \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\". <br />What is nice about such directors like Woody Allen, is that you can typically relate to any family in there, one way or another. It's nice, like comedy. You tend to laugh (more) at the funny bits that you can relate to. <br />Little Miss Sunshine was hard for me to like. And mind you, I don't need a film that I can relate to that I can like, but it does help some. <br />This family was way too much for me. They seemed over-hyped, overly dramatic, a bit too crazy and one in particular, a bit too vular and crude for me to enjoy it. <br />I still wanted to try to enjoy the film, but to me, there wasn't much of a plot. It was basic, which may be nice, but again, the dysfunctional family didn't help, and to me, the humor wasn't really there either. <br />Weather it was a comedy or drama, it didn't matter. It didn't do anything for me. <br />It's hard to like a film when you can't stand the cast. I don't think there was anyone I could put up with. The suicidal one I guess was the only one I could put up with or didn't mind. He was allright. The others, no.

B000B5XZLU|5.0|Dymanmite is yet another montage of eclectic musical genius from Jamirouquai.  Although this album is phenomenal it is no better than any of the others.  Only different, on yet another level.  But then again each of their albums are an expression of the mind(s) and soul(s) behind the sound, boundless.  If you haven't yet seen Jamiroquai in concert you must put attending a performance in the US or abroad high on your list of priorities.  Why?  Don't ask just go and see for yourself.  By the way, my favorite song from the album is Seven Days in Sunny June.
B000JJSM4S|4.0|Having virtually every album the Beatles made (that were available in the U.S.), I never had a doubt that they were the best pop musicians in the world.  I remember my 70 year old grandmother bouncing to the tune \\"Love me do,\\" as she was ironing.  This album is a type of closure for me, for I grew up with the Beatles.  I was 12 when JFK was assassinated (1963), and the world was in a dark hole, mentally and spiritually.  Then the Beatles seemed to appear from nowhere. They were like voices from above that reassured us everything was going to be alright, and that \\"Love\\" truly was the answer.  Unfortunately, like other universal themes, its message still escapes humanity, but its nice to know we have a time capsule in this album we can revisit in our own way and appreciate what the Beatles did for us with their obvious talent (ahead of its time) and timeless message.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I got this DVD a week ago and I have watched it non-stop. This is the REAL Kiss* (my rant about what is being passed off as Kiss in 2006-2007 is below). This is Kiss in the prime time. Before and during the time when this band took over the world. It gets no better than this I promise you!!! <br /> <br />You have over 6 hours of vintage footage here. Every second of it is worth it's weight in gold. You get some TV clips from the mid 70's but most of this is Kiss live. This set has 4 COMPLETE LIVE SHOWS from 1975-1977!!!  <br /> <br />Winterland, San Francisco: This show is AMAZING. Not only is the sound flawless for a 32 year old concert (play this on a surround sound unit with lots of bass and get BLOWN AWAY) and it is filmed in black and white. It gives the show a unique feel. This is very early Kiss. The band already had its famous choreography down, but did not have its huge hit songs yet, or any elaborate stage or explosions. Peter's drums do lift about 10 feet off the ground at one point. Which is impressive for a band that admits it was BROKE at the time, and this was in 1975! The high point (for me) of this concert is the song \\"Watchin' you\\". I have literally watched this song 50 times. This is pure talent and anyone that says Kiss could not play should watch this one. Kiss Is awe-inspiring on this funky track. Ace is jaw-dropping. Peter is a beast. All in all the Winterland show is down right amazing. The band is so tight. Every instrument is spot on. Every member of the band is in top form. This concert is worth the price of this DVD by its self! <br /> <br />Cobo Hall, Detroit: I may be biased because I am from this neck of the woods. But THIS is where Kiss grew leaps and bounds. Detroit is Kiss' favorite place to play and it shows here. Explosions... check. Fire... check. A+ stage show and musicianship... check. The high spot of the show for me here was \\"She/Watchin' you and Parasite\\". Ace does his famous smoking guitar. Gene does his blood puke. Peter has a drum kit that come out 10 feet and up 20. This concert has about 5 encores. The fans were off the chart.  <br /> <br />Budokan Hall, Tokyo: Kiss was huge in Japan (along with other monsters such as Gamera and Godzilla). This is another excellent show. The song \\"Beth\\" is played, as well as \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Rock and Roll All Night\\". Another amazing set. <br /> <br />The Summit, Houston: Yet another fine set from the boys <br /> <br />If you do not own this DVD you are not a fan of rock music period. All 4 members are in top form here. This is all I will ever need. This is the best music DVD ever released!!! <br /> <br />*The Kiss of 2006-2007 is not a band. It is a corporation. It is purely business. Gene Simmons is Donald Trump with a bass guitar. He owns the rights to the music and the rights to the marketing. He has basically cut Peter Criss and Ace Frehley a raw deal. These guys get next to nothing. They do not profit off of merchandise that carries there likeness. \\"Kiss Inc.\\" owns the \\"Cat Man\\" and \\"Space Ace\\" characters that Peter and Ace CREATED. The modern Kiss has Ace and Peter FAKES that dress like them, wear the same make-up, act like them and play like them. And I feel sorry for the individuals that CREATED these characters. Ace and Peter WERE KISS. And it stinks for these founding members to be treated so poorly. BOYCOT the new KISS!!!!!!!
B000GH3CVQ|5.0|I also just saw Once at the Sundance Film Festival.  My husband and I are traveling to Ireland and picked the movie just based on it being filmedin Ireland.   Little did we know, it wasnt Ireland at all that we would fall in love with.  These two artists are absolutely amazing!  Best CD I have bought in a long time!  You will not regret this purchase.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|By the 1960s, the Hollywood western had calcified into formula story-telling; not that there weren't some good movies still being made, but there didn't seem to be anywhere to go for the genre. Then came the Italians and achieved what had escaped Amercican directors: the restoration of the western as a visual (rather than just a literary) art form. Leone's \\"Dollar Trilogy\\" had shown increasing evidence of this, but not until \\"Once Upon A Time...\\" did it all come together. The story itself is pretty trite; what matters are the stunning visuals combined with probably the best musical score ever written. Not being a sports fan, this film would be the only acceptable excuse I could think of to acquire a large-screen plasma TV. What will stick in your mind once you've seen it a few times are the \\"face-plus-music moments\\": Jack Elam's expression when he first hears the harmonica; the camera circling to reveal Henry Fonda's face for the first time; Cheyenne making his entrance at the stage station; Morton crawling toward the mud puddle; and many more. This is truly a masterpiece.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I must admit that I was not a big fan of Al Gore when he ran for President in 2000.  Yes, I agreed with a lot of his views but he seemed to have the air of the elite about him.  I voted for him because \\"he's not GWB\\" almost as much as because of his platform.  However, in recent years that has changed.  I was thrown by his outward presentation style just as many in the U.S. were.  In truth, he's quite an informed and dedicated public servant.<br /><br />As such, now 6 years into the W administration, I see how the environmental issues of not just the U.S. but of the world have been swept under the carpet of \\"more important issues\\".  Are the subjects of prayer in school, gay marriage, the war on terror and social security and health care reform important issues?  (*insert expletive here*) YES.  Of course they are important issues.  They tend to divide our nation.  Any issue that does that is important.  But somewhere along the line our poisoning of the earth got lumped together with the \\"religious\\" issues I just mentioned.  Public opinion seems to say that if you support taking action towards solving global warming you then support those hot issues listed above (restricting religious teachings in public schools, allowing even civil unions for gays or a revisiting of how we have approached the war on terror).  Hence, supporting the fight on global warming has become against Christianity and (unfortunately) against America.<br /><br />And just look at our administration.  They are doing NOTHING to combat it because they are under the impression that it will irrevocably hurt the commerce in our nation.  And, yes, I was concerned about the commercial aspects of \\"radical\\" change in our environmental policy ... until Al Gore revealed that the diminishing of ozone destroying emissions has been successful.<br /><br />Did you know that?  I didn't.  And I didn't because of 2 very important facts:<br /><br />1.  I never heard about it from the media.<br /><br />2.  I never heard a big industrial corporation complain.  Never.<br /><br />It works and with barely a speed bump in our industries.<br /><br />I'll end with the following; If those who follow the teachings of modern Christianity are so literal of their interpretation of the Bible, why does the earth come under the category of something we can abuse?  If God gave us free reign over the earth to do as we will, does it necessarily mean that we should mistreat it?  We don't tolerate spousal or child abuse.  Why tolerate the poisoning of our world?  And what of the idea that God puts hardships in front of us to test us?  Could it not be that He gave us free reign over this planet in order to see if we might destroy it, hence, failing this test?<br /><br />And what of the perspective of \\"sins\\"?  I have heard it put that homosexuality is the most grievous sin imaginable.  Could someone please explain that to me?  A gay relationship involves 2 people just as any committed relationship involves.  Two.  In poisoning the earth we threaten (nowadays) billions.  That tells us something; we have a MAJOR problem that concerns everyone in the world including Christians.  (Who, by the way, are part of the single most popular religion on the planet.  Persecuted?  I don't think so.)  Regardless of the hotbed issues the U.S.A. has been focused on, preserving our planet for future generations of Christians and Muslims and Jews and Republicans and Democrats and liberals and conservatives (to name just a few) alike seems far more important.<br /><br />Let's save these other issues for a time when we're not facing world-wide crises that affects every faith.eard a big industrial corporation complain.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|I am very happy that I purchased this box set.  The packaging is beautiful and I love that it has its' own plexi case to keep it looking nice.  The CD book is beautifully laid out with pictures of the stars and the special features are very good.  I am so glad that I waited to buy the full series on DVD.  It was worth the wait!  It really is a special treat to own this.
B000FIHJLK|4.0|This release is much better than I expected in all aspects. The sound and picture quality is very good. The xtras are a real hoot, a couple interviews with past band members and three promotional videos (all looked to be shot on the same day) that are a very nice addition. RB, as we find out, barely makes the show after being released from jail in Austria, thus making the band very late taking the stage, even Dio alludes to it during the show (..the late hour. The band's setlist is short but has many long performances and Blackmore's guitar is on fire, he really kicks out the jams here. The rest of the band is very tight. I was a bit worried that the 1977 performance would be dark, grainy and sound poor, but you gotta hand it to the German crew, they did a masterful job getting this set down on film. Good job. Feel safe in making this purchase.
B0000025DV|5.0|This is such a great cd and one of ELO's finest achievements. I only rate A NEW WORLD RECORD and TIME slightly better. This is one of Lynne's masterpieces and such a great listen it is. My only complaint is that I wish there were more up-tempo songs than slow/mid-tempo ones, but oh well we all can't have our cake and eat it too! Anyway, if you don't have this cd in your collection/library, by all means, get this one. You won't be disappointed!  Can't wait for the 30th Anniversary Edition cd to be released!  Highlights:\\"TURN TO STONE\\",\\"SWEET TALKIN' WOMAN\\",\\"STARLIGHT\\",\\"JUNGLE\\",\\"STANDIN' IN THE RAIN\\",\\"MR BLUE SKY\\", and \\"SWEET IS THE NIGHT\\"
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Gwen Stefani has an amazing voice and amazing talent, but what did she do? I have been a fan since i was six and i still think she is amazing but she sounds like everything else on the radio. I think she should go back to No Doubt and be that amazing song writer and singer again!
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|This a great masterpiece from ELO. Great song writing, great sound, it's just fantastic! I love listening to this and with the great re-mastering, so wonderful! This is the album that really cemented the ELO sound and made the world take notice how such a great sounding, original band, like no other then or since, ELO really is. That's why I love listening to them so much. I highly recommend this re-mastered cd!   Highlights: \\"TIGHTROPE\\",\\"TELEPHONE LINE\\",\\"SO FINE\\",\\"LIVIN' THING\\",\\"ABOVE THE CLOUDS\\" and the bonus \\"SURRENDER\\"
0385484518|4.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my Pastor since I had read it a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it for it's spirituality and it was also helpful to me in looking at illness and death through the eyes of a person  facing both.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|This is the album that pretty much to me, was the beginning of that ELO \\"sound\\" that I love so very much and was pretty much the time when ELO was really just starting get very popular. I like this album very much and their next album A NEW WORLD RECORD proved to be even better. Jeff Lynne, at this point, seemed more comfortable with the sound that he was trying to achieve for ELO. This album from start to finish is such a wonderful listen, pretty solid, and the re-mastered sound is clean and crisp. I only wish there were more songs on it, but oh well, at least the extra bonuses are a real treat. I definately recommend this album, especially if you are just starting to listen to ELO, this is beginning of what I think is the start of the great ELO sound and song writing.  Highlights: \\"WATERFALL\\",\\"EVIL WOMAN\\",\\"NIGHT RIDER\\" and \\"STRANGE MAGIC\\"
630460288X|4.0|Demolition Man is a very enjoyable action flick.  Its very thought provoking and pure entertainment.  Its definitely one of those movies I catch myself watching whenever it comes on tv.  Sylvester Stallone was terrific as \\"no bull\\" hero,.  And Snipes is very entertaining as the villain.  Wrecking havoc with great one-liners.  I am surprised director Marco Brambilla didn't have many future projects.  I think he would have followed with a number of great action movies.  Anyway, here is the plot.  Its the future, the year 1997 (Be aware, this movie was made in 1992).  prisoners are cryogenically frozen for their time sentence.  During that time, they are all under suspended animation.  John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is the #1 cop and has reputation as the \\"Demolition Man\\".  Why?, because he will go as far as demolishing a building in order to get the job done.  Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) is the world most psychotic criminal.  Spartan finds himself unjustly prisoned after finally pursuing Phoenix, whom he has been chasing for yrs.  However in the process of catching him, several people were killed.  Spartan and Phoenix are both sentenced to the \\"cryoprison\\"  The movie then forwards to 2032 where the world has now become a much different place.  Sex is outlawed, so are tobacco, alcohol, meat and anything unhealthy.  Cars have auto drive, profanity is illegal.  Guns have now become antics, and crime apparently has become a rare event.  Simon is now about to undergo a parole hearing and surprisingly escapes and now continues to create terror and mayhem.  The police quickly realize that they do not know how to handle Simon and realize the only person who can stop Phoenix is John Spartan.  They have him released and team up w/ police officer Lennina Huxley (Sandra Bullock).  As Spartan goes after Phoenix, he finds himself trying to adjust to the new world.  But as he digs through the new world to find him, he learns this new world may not be as nice as it seems.  He learns of its corruptness and that it may have not have been an accident that Phoenix escaped.  With a plot, how could anyone not want to see this film?  However my only real problem with this movie is that it's an Action-Comedy.  A movie like this was not meant to be an action-comedy.  Maybe a few good one liners here or there but that's it.  The comedy in this film is really not that funny and just distracts you from the seriousness of the film.  Simon Phoenix tends to have many goofy habits.  Hell, he's more funny than terrifying.  If Wesley Snipes had been more \\"Blade\\"-like in this movie, I guarantee it would have been one hell of a clash of the titans in the end.  But other than that, its definitely an action film I recommend.
6304493711|4.0|Not listed in the main list of actors, this is John Hannah's first film.  I love the supporting actors more than the main two.  Highlight includes John Hannah doing a poetry reading of Auden at the funeral, very touching and moving.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|I have been a faithful Dream Theater fan for many years now, and they never cease to amaze me! This is without question one of the great live recordings out there today. As a drummer of 30 years, Mike Portnoy inspires me much the way Neil Peart did many years ago. John Petrucci ranks with the great guitar players of any genre. Jordan Rudess is just incredible on the keys, and to think I was worried when Derek Sherinian left the group! John Myung, the quiet one, just holds down the fort on the bass like only he can. James LeBrie nails all the vocals effortlessly. You will be amazed my the tightness of this band, and the Orchestra really compliments the awesome songs of DT's catalog. I also highly recommend buying the DVD as well, there is nothing quite like watching these guys perform either. Simply Awesome!!
078324228X|3.0|Moves kind of slow, but well acted.  Supporting characters make this movie good.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I get tired, REAL tired of customers who wanna be REAL MOVIE CRITICS, going in more depth than the mariana trench. This movie, if you are to see only ONE movie this year, should be it. A classic tale of young love, being torn apart, the finding it once again, with the help of some illusions along the way. The acting was superb, the costumes, hell, I felt like I was in europe 150 years ago! Rent this, then you will buy it, to watch it again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never caught this series the first time around, only when it aired on Sci-Fi.  What a gem! The veritable cast of characters only makes it more interesting, and there's more to them, er, some of them anyway, than meets the eye.  Don't miss this set!!
0307277887|5.0|A lot of readers tend to comment that the ending of this book was not well thought out, kind of came at you from out of nowhere - but I believe, if you read the book after viewing season one of the Showtime series, the ending is plausible and keeps you guessing.  I'm a huge series fan, so this book was wonderful for me.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  You will not regret watching or purchasing this movie -- it is a classic.  It's bittersweet, so don't expect to laugh the entire time (though you will for a good portion of it).  Only watch it with mature children. <br /> <br />Oh how I love this movie.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is superb - everyone should see this excellent documentary and then act on it.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Unlike most people posting reviews of this film here, I had not seen it when I was younger, while on drugs, nor did I even know what Pink Floyd was. Rather I simply found a short clip from \\"The Wall\\" online, watched it, and was stunned. Needless to say, I hunted down the film, and watched it in one sitting, and when it was over? <br /> <br />I bought the original 2 disc album, and listened to it daily. Truth be told, the music itself tells a pretty good story, if dark and depressing for a good deal of it's duration. Had I heard the music before the film, I'd have known what to expect. Of course I didn't, but comparing the two is pretty stupid in my opinion. The reason for that is, while hardcore fans seem to take to heart the fact that the key factors in the production of this film weren't happy with it, they did in fact create a masterpiece of film and music fused into one giant story that has more layers and depth then most films I can name. <br /> <br />Trying to take \\"The Wall\\" and make a film from it, must have been as trying and difficult as Kubrick's direction of \\"2001\\", as both films are stretching and reaching to not only absorb you, but trap you in a world of sight and sound, where there is no escape till the credits roll. The problem with this film is, too many people are viewing it once or twice, and missing more complex metaphors to physiological viewpoints or at the bare minimum, the main point. Merging live action segments with animation, creating tripy and psychedelic imagery for a purpose. It isn't just random algimations here, we are seeing the inner workings of a mind that seeks to isolate itself from the world...and thus build a wall, to keep everything and anything out. <br /> <br />It's much deeper then that, but what must be said is, despite how bizarre or insane it might seem, it's a film that anyone can connect with, since it isn't about \\"Pink\\", it's about everyone, and everything, just as \\"2001\\" wasn't about outer space, it was about humanity and evolution. Everything you see is just window dressing for the real message- <br /> <br />\\"Tear down the wall\\". <br /> <br />This film introduced me to Pink Floyd's music, and to \\"The Wall\\", which stands as one of the greatest rock albums of all time. The film is the visual representation of that album...therefore? <br /> <br />It's one of the greatest films ever made, that doesn't require you to know the music, the band, or anything before going in. Just know you will be glued to your chair for the duration, and when it's over? <br /> <br />You will never be the same again.
B000IY041S|5.0|Never seen an American DVD without Dolby Digital but since this is a German import they dont seem to have the same restrictions. <br /> <br /> Its kind of irritating not knowing this going in since a lot of PC players wont play DTS. Also my DVD player is old and wont play DTS. <br /> <br /> So if all your stuff supports DTS you'll be fine, but beware its DTS only.(it has crummy PCM 48k sound but who wants to listen to that?).
B000KF0NHU|5.0|Great looking HD DVD. Combo format is perfect if you have kids who also want to watch on a SD DVD player. More Combos please!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to see this show on broadway.  Nevertheless, the soundtrack is oh so addicting.  Completely amazing.
B000JBXXZ4|1.0|this album sucks.  there are maybe a couple songs that MIGHT grow on me.  Crow left of the murder was like that but most of the album grew on me.  light grenades is complete trash, and i've been a huge fan for years.if you like incubus and don't want the disappointment of finding this out for yourself, then get the new deftones - saturday night wrist
B00004RFCM|4.0|Sex and the City not only helped establish HBO as much as the Sopranos did, but it also gave adult viewers a show about grown-ups going through mature experiences often funny, sad, ridiculous and unexpected. The movie never felt forced or uninspired until last year, when it went off the tracks creatively. But even then, you still cared about what happened to these four women.It's comedy, its dramatic leanings and emotional diversions have often had the upper, stronger hand in the storytelling.This movie sort of grows on you, even though it's quite possibly the most man-hating thing ever created.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I am a Christian Bale fan, and he can play a poker face with the best of them.  He does just that in this twisted-future flick, where everybody is drugged to keep down violence and war.  Of course, after he misses a few doses, he sides gradually with the resistance.  He tries to deal with newfound emotion while keeping that poker face for his job as top cop/enforcer.  Entertaining, and draws you into his character.
B000ION23K|5.0|I did not think this movie was going to be that enjoyable. But then when I popped  it in to my DVD player, I was suprisingly shocked. I loved every minute of this movie. I thought this movie will be like \\"ANTZ\\", but instead it had a different story line. It was funny how Peanut a human boy was transformed in to a little sized ant and had to live an everyday life like ants. I thought that was something different then any other animated cartoon movies. PLus, this movie gave me second thoughts about never demolishing the ant colonies. My mom even loved this movie, so I bet any age will enjoy this movie.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Christian Bale is excellent as the pre-hero, learning martial arts, disciplines and harsh wisdom from Liam Neeson.  Then Bale reassumes a role in his father's company, from which he manufactures all those bat-trinkets.  Michael Caine as the butler is sharp and plays a greater role in guiding the younger Bruce Wayne.  Ladies like me will love the beefed-up Bale, who looks even hunkier without the bat outfit.  Lots of action as he becomes known as the great crimefighter, but playing the spoiled rich guy from 9 to 5.  He reveals himself only to a childhood girl friend, played sweetly by Katie Holmes.  Bale glides confidently through the special effects, lending realism to the impossible.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|So let me start of by saying that the guys in this movie are smoking hot. But the movie itself was just pretty much boring and the plot wasn't that good at all. The only thing that kept me from stoping to watch this movie were the models. lol. Plus I think most of the guys in this movie were showing fashion rethir then good action. I have to be honost, the fights in this movie reminded me of this cartoon \\"dragon ball Z\\".
B00005JKHP|5.0|Original cast, slinkier uniforms.  It's original Star Trek, so of course it gets an EXCELLENT  rating.  The grandeur of the immense enemy V'ger loses a little on the small screen.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|ABSOLUTELY GREAT!  HAVE WORN THE CD OUT ALREADY FROM SO MANY PLAYS.<br /><br />WHO WOULDN'T LOVE BUBLE'S STYLE.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I don't get the \\"Punk\\" music that came out way, way after the punk revolution was over. What do these guys have to rebel against? I don't know. <br /> <br />That aside, I also don't really care for Greenday's very formulaic structure to songwriting. It all sounds the same to me. Maybe I'm a stickler, but whatever. I see no difference between this and the stuff they put out in the 90's that I didn't love either. <br /> <br />Don't bash me for my opinion, and I won't bash you for yours.
0393978672|4.0|Like many other seminal literary works and ideological manifestos, 'The Origin of Species' has suffered from the fame (and notoriety in equal measure) heaped on it by reviewers, commentators, atheists, agnostics and orthodox bible believers. I would not equate this work with the bible or 'Hamlet' or any other literary work.  This is NOT a literary work: it is a study, a collection of observations from which Darwin himself draws only tentative conclusions.  As a man of science there is little more than Darwin can do because the truth lies somewhere between 'we don't have a clue' to '42' and he admits as much at various points in his published research.   <br /> <br />What is fascinating - to me, at any rate - is watching the process of his logic unfold as the pages are devoured. I wonder how many readers of this have read publications from, say, the Church of Scientology?  I must confess I have not but my given understanding is that there is no way of completely proving or disproving their mantras.   <br /> <br />This book has set in train a wondrous debate about God, Creation and Natural Selection and in that sense it ranks as a work which although difficult at times to read - Darwin would I'm sure admit to being no literary genius - is worth reading simply to discover for yourself what all the fuss is about.  <br /> <br />I think it's important to read historical reports of the aftermath of the publication of the first edition of this book. That in itself and the ensuing debate is, in my opinion, at least as interesting, if not more so, than the work which sparked the whole thing off.
B00005JO1R|4.0|I was not that familiar with Johnny Cash, June Carter, or their music when I saw Walk The Line, and I fell in love with both the music and the story. Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary as Cash, and Reese Witherspoon leaves behind her blond dingbat roles to morph into Carter. Wonderful acting jobs.    But...    I have since read biographies of Cash by those close to him, and am disappointed by the fictions told or implied by the script. For instance, my favorite scene, where Cash plays for Sam Phillips for the first time, is awesome and unforgettable -- except for the fact that it didn't happen anything close to how it was portrayed. That's to be expected in a biopic, but what annoys me is that you're left with the impression that after June accepted Cash's marriage proposal he got clean of drugs and they lived happily ever after. The truth apparently is that he used drugs for practically the rest of his life, trapped by an addiction that damaged his career and reputation, almost destroyed his marriage, and over the years took a horrible toll on his health. We see Cash struggling with drugs in the film, but according to Walk The Line, all it took was a good woman to set him free.     Enjoy this film -- and there is a ton of stuff to enjoy -- but know that it unfortunately leaves us with a simplified -- and typical -- Hollywood ending.

0743289684|5.0|It is difficult nowadays to get an objective, nuanced opinion on Islam, neither flattering nor biased against it. If I were to recommend a way to try and achieve this, I would suggest reading several good books on the matter, including this one among them.     This is a wonderful autobiography. I knew that Ayaan Hirsi Ali was a controversial thinker, but I was afraid that her life would be boring. However, the author manages to narrate her own life and circumstances in such a way that I could not put it down, and read it in less than two week's time. I highly recommend it.    Other books that I would recommend reading (as Khaled M. Abou El Fadl -scholar trained in both Islamic and Western law- says, non-muslims \\"first and foremost [are to] learn and understand, because nothing helps the puritans' cause as much as Western ignorance, prejudice and hate\\") would be the following:     ASSESSMENTS OF ISLAM:     1) The best, impartial, wise: \\"Islam. History, present, future\\" by Hans Küng (written in German, already available in Spanish, English translation coming in  2007).     2) Harsh but well argued: \\"Muslims in the West: Redefining the Separation of Church & State\\" by Sami Awad Aldeeb Abu-Sahlieh.     3) Moderate Islam at its best: \\"The Great Theft : Wrestling Islam from the Extremists\\" by Khaled M. Abou El Fadl     HISTORY:     1) General: \\"The Venture of Islam\\", by Marshall G. S. Hodgson (nowadays a classic included in any bibliography on Islam).     2) Turks: \\"The Turks in World History\\" by Carter Vaughn Findley.     3) Political theory: \\"God's Rule : Government and Islam\\" by Patricia Crone.     4) Jihad: \\"Understanding Jihad\\" by David Cook (it also seems interesting although I have not read it yet: \\"Jihad in Islamic History: Doctrines and Practice\\" by Michael Bonner).
0743298020|5.0|For anyone who yearns to experience a really good \\"snuggle in the blankets by the fire\\" story, The Thirteenth Tale is definitely the book to read. Diane Setterfield expertly creates an unforgettable world of characters each with their own vivid set of dreams, regrets, and mysteries that will simultaneously haunt and enchant the reader. The Thirteenth Tale is a fictional masterpiece that no doubt reminds us how to absorb a story with childlike awe and captivation.

B00005JNX0|5.0|While probably a kids movie, the fun factor can be enjoyed from both kids and parents alike.  Each of the animated animals in the film had a distinct feel, and NONE of them were annoying, which is a big plus in animation because it seems like everybody wants to throw in at least one annoying character these days.  Not so in Madagascar. <br /> <br />The penguins were absolutely hysterical.  The quality of the storyline is pretty good too, and the humor never fails.  Of course, as an adult, you have to kind of force yourself to pay attention to animated films for the entire length, but I was able to keep myself entertained, and I hope you are too.
B00006LSM3|2.0|Love the Beatles since childhood, of course John and Paul solo, even the occasional Ringo, but George always will have a special place as the unappreciated and vastly under-rated 3rd musical genius of the group. In many ways George was deeper on a spiritual and emotional level, which I believe was best reflected in his music and ability, all the while continuing to stay in the backdrop of Lennon-McCartney. I think both John and Paul consciously and unwittingly each burned this man to their own detriment. I think Paul realized this a bit too late, sadly, and may also regret not having spent a fraction of the time he used up in his downturn periods with John.   <br /> <br />I have most of George's work on vinyl, cassette and CD, and my spouse and kids are very well aquainted with the majority of his work, whether they know the titles or not. I was very saddened by his passing, and of course wistful as I had been with John's passing - because I knew we were being \\"robbed\\" again of what might still have been to come. So I just had to get his last release, placing it ahead of anything else that might be on my musical wish list. It saddens me to say that I think George, of course knowing his condition and the inevitabile, likely just kind of let go. Maybe it just was a simple release from what he had previously wanted to accomplish, maybe he felt he had nothing left to prove (too true), or maybe he just wanted to express and vent - no frills. Maybe worse, he just didn't have it any more. For me though, it just wasn't the George that pierces the heart, mind and soul, that brings one to a deeper appreciation of how profound our relationships are and  <br />what they should be or make us feel. This wasn't the same George, and I will miss him that much more.

B000002GEV|5.0|I first saw Supertramp in 1973 as the rhythm section for Chuck Berry at London's Rainbow theater. A few years later Crime of the Century showed up, courtesy of an older brother. We played the grooves out of several copies. IMO it's a really great album (their only great album) that has held up over the years. 30+ years later and on another continent and I still love listening to it!
B000G7PMD2|5.0|This is, by far, the best sounding live CD (and DVD) I have ever heard!!! Nothing comes even close. Their talent is just jaw dropping and add the orchestra and you obtain a mind blowing piece of work. I went to the DT 20th aniversary tour when they played in San Francisco. It was a good show but I was disappointed that it was not as extensive as the shows that they play in NYC. They always seem to play better in NYC for some reason. Other than that, its great! Dont hesitate, just go and buy it! You will get your money's worth, I guarantee it!!!
B00005M1CO|4.0|I've known Elvenking with the album \\"The Winter Wake\\" ... <br />The first time I bought Elvenking was quite strange...I have a huge archieve,that I was looking for something new,and I bought Elvenking for the good looking of it's cover... <br /> <br />And when I listened to it,i loved it,more than I expect... <br /> <br />I immediately bought the albums Heatenreel and Wyrd,they are also great,but again to be honest they didn't give the feeling of the Winter Wake... <br /> <br />The first characteristic of Elvenking is,their music is kinda \\"cheery\\"... <br />Melodies are cute,and it has a different magic that makes the listener happy <br />And for sure,they will make your heart beat faster! <br /> <br />I like their pass melodies within a song,you'll see that it is their characteristic. <br />And they used other instruments (Flute,Violyn,Classical Guitar) well,and complete the soul of this great music... <br /> <br />Another Haven,Moonchariot,White Willow,The Wanderer are some of the top songs of Elvenking I like... <br /> <br />I recommend everyone to buy it really,if they are seeking a different perspective for the harmony of folk melodies with Power metal,since you'll see Elvenking is \\"original\\"
B000LC3ID8|4.0|This movie wraps up what actually turned out to be a decent trilogy. Both main storylines are compelling, and the conclusion offers a few actual surprises. The violence is brutal and some of the traps, as usual, are sadistically ingenious. Also included is some nice 'fill in the gaps of the previous films' material; This is a well-rounded, satisfying 'gorror' movie that lives up to the previous films reputations, and then some. I'm not sure the skull operation scene close ups were entirely needed, but hey...Plus these movies give you some interesting ideas to think about in terms of 'what have I really done with my life? what kind of person would Jigsaw say I am?'. I give these movies points for this, because at least they're trying to get you to think, even if it's on a semi-surface level, and often lost in a sea of blood and shredded pig corpses.

0393327655|5.0|Though I hesitate to use biblical analogies in discussing atheism, my utter lack of compositional creativity leaves me with no better alternative.  So I say this:  if Bertrand Russell's writings were the Old Testament of atheism, Sam Harris has provided us with atheism's New Testament.  Single-handedly responsible for the resurgence of atheism, The End of Faith offers a rational and scientific treatment of atheism that is far superior to all other contemporary writings in the atheist canon, even surpassing the much beloved writings of Richard Dawkins.  The End of Faith is an extremely well-researched, supremely intellectual tome that effectively dissects both the philosophical, historical, and modern problems posed by religion.  Using a highly persuasive, logically grounded philosophical thesis that is augmented by the most up-to-date scientific findings, Harris provides the reader with a solid argument against religious dogma that serves as both a warning to humanity and an optimistic alternative to the world of religion.  Harris also uses modern evolutionary psychology and neuroscience to tackle an argument that has long troubled even the most learned atheists, namely, without God, why be moral?  Well, modern science seems to have an answer.  We're hardwired to be good.  Religion doesn't serve as the basis for morals, our brains are already programmed for morality.  Religion only serves to cloud our naturally ethical inclinations by giving humanity a reason for infighting.  The controversial and often misinterpreted chapter on spirituality and mysticism is anything but a defense of religion.  Rather, Harris argues that the deeply personal and seemingly inexplicable spiritual phenomena that often lead people to accept the supernatural may actually be nothing more than altered states of consciousness that have perfectly rational explanations, but have yet to be properly investigated and well-understood by science.  Let us hope that all of humanity reads this book.A future defined by reason rather than superstition may seem like a pipe dream, but perhaps reason can serve to uproot the stronghold of religion in the people's hearts and minds.

B000JLTR8G|5.0|I saw the movie, The Yakuza, in 1975.  I remember going into the theater and not knowing what to expect.  Sidney Pollack directed this film.  He'd just finished The Way We Were and later went on to do Out of Africa and Tootsie.  Mr. Pollack was drawn to the script of The Yakuza because it dealt with honor, obligation, friendship, and lost love.  It was also his chance to learn more about the Japanese culture and how we differ from them and their way of thinking.  For me, it was a learning experience about true friendship and keeping one's promises.<br /><br />The story deals with Harry Kilmer (played by Robert Mitchum) being asked by one of his best friends, George Tanner (played by Brian Keith), to go to Japan and rescue his daughter, who's been kidnapped by the Japanese Yakuza.  It seems that Tanner had business dealings with the Yakuza and was supposed to buy guns for one clan in particular.  He spent the money, rather than buying the weapons, and now his daughter is being held as a hostage until the guns are produced.  Kilmer reluctantly returns to Japan to fulfill his debt to Tanner, but in order to save Tanner's daughter, he has to call in an old favor from a Japanese man named Tanaka Ken (played by Ken Takakura).  The payment of this debt will bring great pain into Ken's life and create an obligation on Kilmer's part.  In the end, both men will have to join together to take on a Yakuza clan in mortal combat--two men with only a shotgun and a sword against thirty.<br /><br />This is much more than a movie about swordplay and violence.  It's a love story about loss and redemption.  It's about how a person chooses to repay his debts because it's his actions that make him a man.  It's about friendship and the cost it entails.  If you're true of heart, this movie can't help but resonate with you.  I've seen it at least twenty-five times over the last thirty years, and the ending is just as powerful now as it was back in 1975.  I can still feel Robert Mitchum's pain as he pushes a token of his apology toward Tanaka Ken and ask that he and Eiko be forgiven for the pain that's been brought into his life.  The DVD of The Yakuza has a fifteen-minute vintage featurette on the making of the movie.  That turned out to be better than I thought it would.  There's a feature-length commentary with Sidney Pollack, which isn't too bad.  He talks about what drew him to the script and how the Japanese culture intrigued him.  There's also a lot of discussion about lighting and why he used the \\"wide screen\\" format for this film.  Last, there are subtitles for all the Japanese that's spoken in the movie.  Some of the VHS videos had many of the subtitles deleted, but not so in the DVD.  This is the 112 minute version that was released in the United States and not the 123 minute version that was seen in Japan.  The motion picture soundtrack by Dave Grusin can now be found on CD through Amazon.  Only three thousands copies of the CD were pressed and that was done back in early 2006.  I had to pay an arm and a leg for my copy, but it was worth it.  Of all the movies I've seen over the last fifty years, The Yakuza remains my all-time favorite film.  Highly recommended!!!ushes a token of his apology toward Tanaka Ken and ask that he and Eiko be forgiven for the pain that's been brought into his life.

B00062RCBW|5.0|I started watching TNG when it premiered in 1987, and have continued to watch it on and off ever since.  In '87 I liked the show because of the weird looking alien costumes, but as an adult I can watch the show and enjoy it for completely different reasons.   <br /> <br />While the very thing that attracted me to this program in my childhood is now one of the things I find somewhat distracting when viewing it in my mid twenties, I find that there is more than enough good writing to make up for it.  I'm glad this show has been released on DVD, and whats more, I hope to buy it someday.   <br /> <br />Hopefully one day Paramount will stop asking almost $400.00 for seven seasons of a t.v. show.  I have purchased many other season sets from many different studios (including Paramount) and I have rarely seen such a gouging.   <br /> <br />
B000GUJF4G|5.0|Loud, explosive and amazingly violent! What a thrill ride. This is what a disaster movie should be.  <br /> <br />I wasn't sure about this movie due to all of the negative reviews. Now having seen it, my wife and I had a blast watching this film. <br /> <br />Sure, the characters are given next to nothing when it comes to development,  but honestly, we couldn't care less. It is all about the action baby! Hardly a moment goes by where you can relax enough to take a breath.  <br /> <br />Technically, this is an awesome presentation. The video is perfect, with fabulous color and detail regardless of scene (bright, dark, dry or wet).  And the sound! WOW. The Dolby TrueHD track had the house just-a-rockin'. The LFE channel was amazing and the surrounds got a workout. This is a good movie to show off your electronics and let you know all of that hard earned cash sunk into receivers and speakers was not wasted.  <br /> <br />Is it an Oscar hopeful for Best Picture. Nope. It is a hell of a lot of fun and a great way to make it through a bag or two of extra buttery microwave popcorn. To be sure.  <br /> <br />We are fans of the original Poseidon, and while that was a traditionally better film, I would have to say the new version is more entertaining in its own way. I wouldn't even venture comparing the two in any depth (ha! no pun intended). It is like reading a book and then seeing the movie. Both can be extremely entertaining, but they will be different.  <br /> <br />Buy it, you will like it, if you like non-stop action and excellent special effects.

B00003CXWV|4.0|Depp always commit full heartedly to his performances and this film is no exception.  His near flawless performance as the very unlikeable George Jung, for me, is jaw-dropping as it is aspiring.  There is no real point to this story other to just let us peek inside the life of a man who establish the cocaine trade in America.  The director is careful to keep you at arms length while adding subtle touches to humanize Jung.  The best way to do that with an American audience is to throw in a sad looking kid.  We're suckers for children.<br /><br />Maybe the message is: If you're not careful, you too can make a career out of bad choices or maybe it's just fun to watch Johnny Depp do his thing.

0316172324|3.0|\\"Blink\\" is a very interesting book to read.  Plenty of stories that really make you think about how people make decisions, even first impressions. The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 5 is that though the book is interesting, after finishing it, I'm unsure of how to apply what I have read or even if there is any benefit to applying what I have read.  The book's focus is on the bad and good decisions that people or companies have made in the blink of an eye.  But, even as I write this, I'm still left with -- what did I really learn and can I apply it?  It's still a good read but I wish I would have borrowed it from the library instead of buying it.

B000053V7Q|5.0|Forget the other offerings in the Elvis Presley category. This is the only DVD you will need to own. \\"That's the Way It Is\\" serves as a silencer to the critical public's opinion of Presley in the 70s. Presley truly cares about these performances, and his effort and voice pound the music to life. This is Presley at his best... humble, motivated, striving to put his crown back on the throne after the bland motion pictures that sought to confine him in the 60s. \\"That's the Way It Is\\" has been masterfully redone from the original, with all the annoying distractions finally gone. (We loved the fan interviews, respectfully of course, but let's face it, this movie is about The Man.) I only wish \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight\\" had not been taken out. (In case you don't know, someone flubbed on the original releases and included \\"....Lonesome Tonight\\" on the original DVDs sent to the stores. The April 10 release date is of the \\"new\\" DVDs with the song edited out.) Bottom line, this movie proves that Elvis is king and that's just the way it is.  <br /> <br />
B000056IKS|5.0|My favorite music is free form type of stuff, so hearing \\"Hallo Gallo\\" made me buy this CD. I have heard this band before but never bought anything by them in the past. This is a hard album to put in a catagory, maybe 70's Krautrock?? This album is a perfect example of how much you can do with a little when you know a lot. There is not much in the way of melodies, but the sonic structure is what makes this record. The fact that there are guitars on this album, really give it a dynamic push/pull that most electronic music lacks. There is a balance of beautiful weirdness and improvisational structure that has it's roots in much 60's psychedelic music, the make up the heart of this music. Truly unique.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd has always lived in the shadow of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan but with this release he travels back to the roots of the Blues to pay tribute and give back to those that made and shaped this music.  Kenny shows maturity and grace when playing alongside some of the greats even though it is his album and his dvd. Kenny's plays to support and highlight the legends instead of overshadow them and it makes this project one of the best blues releases in recent memory. At the same time you can always tell when he steps into the spotlight as that biting tone gives you shivers.  Kenny clearly continues to have command over his instrument but it is nice to see some restraint and respect given to the forefathers (and mothers with Ms Etta Baker)  The dvd is fantastic and a true treasure in that since the making of this film several members of the cast have passed away.  This project was clearly done with love in mind and it shows.  I thank Kenny for making this album and I certainly hope he will recieve a grammy for this as it will be for all of the legends.  I can not recommend this enough.

It's great to have him back at full artistic power.
0312119038|5.0|As this is a book relating to Catholicism, it is fitting for me to start the review with a confession. I bought this book not because I was interested in it, but because I wanted to read its sequel - The Spiral Staircase - and felt I should read this book first. I was not interested all that much in the story of becoming a nun and my only curiosity was how Miss Armstrong would find anything interesting to say about it.<br /><br />Well, I was off the mark. Karen Armstrong's recounting of her 2 years in the convent (and subsequent disenchantment with the process) are fascinating. Most of the action in this story takes place inside the subject's head as she tries to wrestle with being human in a place where humanness is to be shed (as one must renounce worldy desires, thoughts, and feelings to be close to God).<br /><br />Karen Armstrong does a magnificent job of depicting what this conflict is like. The process of becoming a nun, as Armstrong describes it, is a rigorous program of self-denial. One is not to complain, be tired, be mournful, be happy, be questioning, or let onesself feel any of the things that come with the territory of being human. Rather, it was taught that the pinnacle of the spiritual life was the abillty to shed one's humanness, to think and feel only about one thing - God.<br /><br />Armstrong also tells of a very hierarchal system where to question one's superiors is to question God (as one's superiors are closer to God than onesself; that is why they are superiors). With accuity of word, Karen Armstrong recounts how she was constantly made to feel insignificant and imbecilic by her superiors. At the same time, feeling bad about this was attributed to her weak spirit and - so it was called - her selfishness.<br /><br />Armstrong's story ends when she voluntarily leaves the convent after experiencing much too much. Here she tells of the schock of living in a 'regular' world after years of physical and emotional seclusion.<br /><br />This is much more interesting a book than i had originally thought it would be. Owing to Armstrong's ability to describe the internal struggle between her desire to be human and her desire to devote herself to God, Through the Narrow Gate has an incredible forward motion. As The Spiral Staircase picks up where this book leaves off, I cannot wait to read the latter half of Karen Armstrong's remarkable journey.>This is much more interesting a book than i had originally thought it would be.

B00005JOLI|4.0|Yeah I would like the Movie to be longer, but 15 hrs could not do this great story any more justice. I loved it and cannot believe the negative reviews. It will take its place along with the Harry Potter sieries. I am well over 13 and a little beyond 55.
0393317552|1.0|Considering Diamond stated at the outset of this poorly written book that he was not writing a 'racist treatise', I was confused when I read several pages later that Australian aborigines are genetically superior to Europeans. Really, Diamond, how does an alleged superior ability to map out one's environment translate to genetic superiority?
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is the best musical performance on DVD I have ever seen.  The concert is spectacular visually and in sound quality, not to mention the song selection.  It is a timesless classic that I could not have found at a better price.
B00005U122|5.0|This concert is simply the best that's out there. The song selection is absolutely perfect (although \\"whish you were here\\" could have been replaced by, say, \\"Hey You\\" or \\"Echoes\\" or any other song; since it seems to be part of any live performance of Floyd or Waters). I'm glad they did \\"Dogs\\", which IMHO is one of (if not) the best Floyd number. As for Waters' Solo songs, \\"It's A Miracle\\" along with \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" rank the top with Graham Broad's astonishing drums and Jon Carin's keyboards . \\"Comfortably Nomb\\" is nice duo between Snowy White and Doyle Bramhall. All in all, this is a must have for Floyd fans or people who like to watch more than two hours of \\"great\\" music.
0743455967|4.0|Although King's \\"memoir of the craft\\" is a couple rungs below Writing for Dummies in terms of usefulness to anyone who has written more than her name and address on an envelope, it is at times a funny and inspiring insight into the making--and near unmaking-- of one of the bestselling authors of all time. <br /> <br />In the beginning of On Writing, we learn that King survived years of rejection slips from would-be publishers before winning the lottery with Carrie. At the end of the book, King recounts the details of surviving a horrible accident that befell him in the late 90s. Elementary advice about important stylistic elements of writing fiction is stuffed in between. <br /> <br />I would like to write that King's advice was helpful, but it wasn't...at least to me. Maybe other wannabes learned more than I did and would tout King's sagely writing wisdom. Be that as it may, what I found most helpful was witnessing through King's narrative the importance of hard work, perseverance, and passion in developing a career as a writer. <br /> <br />Oh, and a little talent never hurt.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Does anyone know how many seasons there are to Charmed? I just bought 1-6 and have ordered 7 but I see people are talking about 8 so I was wondering if it's still on or how mant seasons there are.<br /><br />Thanx so much!!
B00004TFRF|3.0|Either I'm not deep enough or this film is just too weird, or maybe these two deficiencies met each other halfway, but anyway I didn't get much from this film. The same basic themes: <br /> <br />(a) identity is fluid  <br />(b) nothing is real  <br />(c) sex makes us do weird things <br /> <br />are mostly covered and better treated in the film 'Jacob's Ladder'. <br /> <br />A big HOWEVER though - this movie has one FANTASTIC scene which probably could justify all the money otherwise wasted in its creation: that is Mr. Eddie's encounter with the tailgating driver! Oh Lordie! That was SOOOO satisfying! Worth the price of admission for sure. Anybody who has ever driven a car - lick your chops and savor well!
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige stands as a successful film in the sense that it delivers what it promises to the audience: a challenging and fun mystery (how did Bale and Jackman pull off their respective Transporting Man tricks?), believable tension between the two male leads, a worthwhile side story involving Bale's wife and Johanson, and a very very good red herring in Tesla.  And the director juggles all these elements succesfully so that the end product is a film that masterfully balances all these into a cohesive story.   <br /> <br />Also, unlike the Illusionist (a movie with a similar theme and a similar open date) which fails to incorporate the story with its foundation (\\"All is not as it seems\\") the Prestige is succesful because its story is true to its founding principle - the obesession for 'prestige.'  While the storyline at times delineated into several timelines and characters, the major piece never wavered from the two magicians' obsession to out-do and out-perform one another.  By the end of the film, when all is revealed, you see how far the two men have gone to fulfill their goals and you can almost hear the mental click as everything comes together into a whole piece. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there is at least one major logical flaw with this movie. *SPOILER AHEAD*   <br /> <br />I understand why Bale would have to reveal the identity of Tesla to Jackman for the movie to create its grand red herring, but than at the end of the film one wonders why in the world would Bale even know about Tesla's machine.  After all, Tesla's machine had nothing to do with Bale's trick at all!  Moreover, Bale could not have possibily known about Tesla's machine, as it did not even work until the end of Jackman's stay at Colorado.  On the other hand, if Bale just threw out the name at random to get Jackman to commit years and fortune, than the end result is a huge coincidence that just defies logic. <br /> <br />The only possible explanation for all this is if Bale knew in theory that Tesla could perfect such a machine, and so sent Jackman on what he believed to be a fool's errand.  After all, such a machine could not possibly be built, right?  This would explain Bale's knownledge of Tesla, his machine, and why he would fool Jackman with Tesla's name.  But even this theory has its holes, as Tesla's assistant claims that someone (logically referring to Bale) has already purchased this machine, and Tesla himself works in ernest to perfect it for Jackman's satisfaction. <br /> <br />In the end, there is no clear and logical answer to this flaw.  Even if the viewer didnt catch its significance, I believe that because of this the viewer, in his mind, will not be completely satisfied with the story.  Even when the conscious fails to spell out such a flaw, the sub-conscious almost always does recognize it.  Hence the 'feeling of bad taste' in the viewer's mind when they are presented with very complex storylines that include logical holes in them. <br /> <br />In any case, overall the Prestige is a very good flick, and certainly worth a view.
068815333X|5.0|In the last (so far) of the Kenzie / Gennaro tales, Lehane shows growth and imagination, as the trio from Dorchester go after a new kind of psycho bad guy, a serial killer who gets people to kill themselves.<br /><br />This very imaginative plot puts the team of Patrick, Angie & a very angry Bubba, to their greatest test yet.<br /><br />I have said before that I am not really a detective story kind of guy, but Lehane shows again that loyalty, and good versus evil are universal themes, and he transforms the genre to cusp of literature. He just gets better as a writer at every outing. Although he seems to have gotten through about all the kinds of bad guys I can imagine with these tales, I hope that this is not the last outing for these characters whom I have grown to care about.<br /><br />Isn't that what great books do?
0307346609|5.0|Wow!  I went into reading this book expecting another mediocre reading experience...it seems like nearly every book I've read recently with zombies in it hasn't been all that good and I'd actually been putting off reading World War Z for several months for this very reason...as it turns out, I need not have worried, Brooks' book is quite a step up from what I've been reading and I really enjoyed it!  I think that Brooks has pulled off something that is difficult for the zombie genre...being a largely visual medium, the world of zombie is sometimes hard to capture adequately in words...Brooks has accomplished this by leaving the Zombies in the background (though there are some very graphic descriptions of zombies and their attacks interspersed throughout the narratives) and using first person narratives to tell the story of an alternative future history...what I like to call a \\"might be.\\"  The author takes the idea...what WOULD happen if the dead started to rise...how would individuals and governments react...who would accept it and prepare, who would deny it to their own detriment...it's an idea that anyone who has watched even one zombie flick has thought about.  What would *I* do...how would my neighbors react...people in large cities...would it become global and how would peoples all over the world react.  This book covers it all and in a unique way.<br /><br />In World War Z Brooks has chosen to explore the scope and magnitude of a zombie infection through \\"interviews\\" with individuals from all over the globe...every country, every race...from doctors to soldiers to politicians to mercenaries and beyond.  This isn't the \\"everyman's\\" story; these are interviews with people from the \\"inside,\\" those in the know and those who are part of the \\"war machine\\" from start to finish.  What really makes this novel stand out is the individual narratives strung together to form a larger picture of the entire \\"invasion,\\" instead of choosing one group (or several small groups located in different locations) to focus on, thus NOT personalizing it with a single group or individual and their experience through the \\"war.\\"  Don't get me wrong, the story is still individualized, but in a broader way that gives humanity a face through the key players of the \\"war.\\"  There are definitely places where I wanted to know WAY more...where Brooks could certainly flesh out these stories, making each into an individual novel (a series)...I longed for that in places, but has he done that, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much...probably what the novel really needed were a few places where the \\"narrator\\" filled in some \\"historical\\" details to help bring the novel to a more cohesive whole...but really this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />Overall, World War Z is well written, humorous (Brooks skewers politicians, the military-industrial complex, pop culture, and the \\"modern\\" way of life in an equal opportunity fashion) and which gives the reader the best of both worlds...zombies AND human drama!  I particularly liked how the interviews wove together a picture of each country the world over...each with its own strengths and weaknesses (some were geographically advantaged or disadvantaged, for others it was culturally or politically) and how those strengths and weaknesses played out across the globe.  I give World War Z five stars...it certainly takes from Romero and others...but it definitely has its own message and is well worth reading, I'd recommend it to fans of the zombie genre wholeheartedly...but I think it also had appeal outside of the horror/zombie fan base...while it does have zombies and is graphic in places, this is really a human story...a drama told in individual interviews that really reached out to the reader, there were a few places where I got a little misty eyed, or outraged, and yes grossed out.  Well done and very hard to put down!in different locations) to focus on, thus NOT personalizing it with a single group or individual and their experience through the \\"war.\\"  Don't get me wrong, the story is still individualized, but in a broader way that gives humanity a face through the key players of the \\"war.\\"  There are definitely places where I wanted to know WAY more...where Brooks could certainly flesh out these stories, making each into an individual novel (a series)...I longed for that in places, but has he done that, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much...probably what the novel really needed were a few places where the \\"narrator\\" filled in some \\"historical\\" details to help bring the novel to a more cohesive whole...but really this is a minor quibble.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|Wonderful movie,I am glad I finally bought it. A real time love story!!
0596101996|5.0|The previous edition of this book, 4th edition, remained at arm's length at all times at work and rescued me repeatedly from various day-to-day JavaScript challenges.  It has become tattered from rigorous use.  I always loved how the book was organized, with the first half as a walk through the entire gamut of JavaScript's workings -- tutorials, walk-thrus, code samples, cross-browser issues, and practical solutions -- and the second half of the book as a complete JavaScript language and DOM reference.  That already very useful format has actually been improved upon.  David has combined the DOM API reference and client-side JavaScript reference into a single alphabetized section.  Now that I think about it, I did find myself flipping back and forth a lot in the previous edition, so this is a welcome improvement.  Each object, property, and method contains a helpful \\"availability\\" of that item.  This may be the standards spec it came from [DOM Level 2 HTML, ECMAScript v1], the JavaScript version in which it emerged [JavaScript 1.0], or a list of browser versions, if it is a proprietary feature.  This is critical info to have at-a-glance - could perhaps save you 2 days of work implementing a non-standard, IE-specific JavaScript feature, when you could have been coding the standards-compliant equivalent.  David has removed a lot of the deprecated, not-widely-adopted DOM interfaces that no longer apply to modern browsers.  David has also moved focus away from some of the more oddball DOM interfaces that have been replaced by more sensible JavaScript objects that implement those interfaces, for example, window.getComputedStyle() rather than AbstractView.getComputedStyle().  In  other words, David has removed all of the \\"stuff that still exists, but you no longer need to worry about\\".  This makes for a more focused, less cluttered, \\"on topic\\", useful tome.  I don't need to know about the 10 different methods that browser manufacturers fought over 7 years ago.  Tell me what I need to know NOW to write practical, functioning, modern, cross-browser JavaScript.  That's exactly what Mr. Flanagan has accomplished. <br /> <br />What else is new in the 5th edition? <br /> <br />1. Nested functions and closures. <br /> <br />2. A dedicated \\"Classes, Constructors, and Prototypes\\" chapter, with much more coverage on object-oriented programming in JavaScript. <br /> <br />3. A new chapter on Modules and Namespaces. <br /> <br />4. New chapter on scripting Java with JavaScript. <br /> <br />5. Coverage of the legacy (Level 0) DOM has been combined with the W3C standard DOM.  More consolidation.  Less flipping back and forth. <br /> <br />6. Cookies and Client-Side Persistence.  Updated coverage on cookies, and brand new coverage of other client-side persistence techniques, like IE userData persistence, and Flash Shared Object Persistence. <br /> <br />7. AJAX - Coverage of scripted HTTP calls using the now famous XMLHttpRequest object. <br /> <br />8. XML - Demonstrates how to create, load, transform, query, serialize, and extract info from XML docs. <br /> <br />9. Client-Side Graphics - JavaScript's graphics capabilities. The cutting edge &lt;canvas> tag, SVG, VML, and communicating with the Flash plug-in. <br /> <br />10. Scripting Java Apps and Flash Movies - Another brand new chapter. <br /> <br />So, is the 5th edition worth the purchase?  Absolutely.  This book is a must-have for any web development library.  I turn to it repeatedly.  Here's an example. <br /> <br />Last week, I overheard a developer on my team proclaim to someone, \\"We can't do that. JavaScript can't control stuff in another frame.\\"  They went and informed my boss how monumental their task was becoming as they proposed a hacky, inelegant server-side workaround. <br /> <br />I managed to grab the one developer and said, \\"JavaScript certainly can talk across frames.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Really?!\\", he asked, astonished.  I opened \\"The Definitive Guide\\" to the part on cross-frame scripting and bookmarked it for them. <br /> <br />\\"Oh, wow!  GREAT!\\", he exclaimed, \\"That completely solves our problem.  Totally cool!\\" and zipped away book in hand.  Hours later, they had it worked out, rather than days with the server-side solution. <br /> <br />I've seen some one-star, complaint-type reviews posted that this isn't a beginner book.  Exactly right, but I'm confused as to how a quality rating [of 1 to 5 stars] equates, in any way, to skill level of the book, or its ability to meet someone's self-conceived personal notions of what the book is supposed to contain.  There are some overview-type chapters that go over syntax, operators, scope, expressions, and the usual array of language basics, but these reviewers are correct in that this book is not a beginner's tutorial on JavaScript.  It is a meat and potatoes, soup to nuts definitive guide and reference on all of the important and practical aspects of JavaScript programming.  It is not a cookbook of cute-but-useless cut-n-paste recipes [although there are plenty of USEFUL code examples].  It is not the quick-and-dirty example of how to slap the hottest AJAX library into your site to attempt to make it behave like a Windows app.  The chapter on AJAX shows you how to use the XML HTTP object directly, wrapped up in some nice reusable routines, so you can WRITE YOUR OWN AJAX-based features [which I prefer over using someone else's complicated, obfuscated framework]. <br /> <br />Great job, again, David!  If you develop websites in any capacity, you need this book.  It should be on every developer's shelf. <br />

B000HT386M|3.0|None of Adam Sandler's films are particularly well liked by critics, but audiences always love him. Never the less, \\"Click\\" was a new low for the comedy superstar. It got some of the worst reviews of the year and it didn't even manage to \\"click\\" with audiences. That didn't stop it from being a box-office success anyway and the film does have its merits. Sandler plays Michael Newman, an architect, who is being crushed under the pressure of family life and work. One night, fed up with the fact he can't find the correct remote to turn on the TV, he goes to Bed, Bath, and Beyond to pick up a universal remote. In an incredibly cheap joke, he heads into the Beyond section and meets Morty (Christopher Walken) who gives him what he's looking for. Problem is, when Michael returns home he finds that the remote control lets him control his universe. He can pause, skip, rewind, and mute...Whatever he wants. Using the remote to skip arguments with his wife (the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale), hit his boss (David Hasselhoff, who manages to score some laughs), and get to work quicker we start to realize how similar this movie is to another recent comedy hit. \\"Bruce Almighty.\\" This movie openly and unapologetically borrows from other, more superior films, that came before it much like the 2006 Robin Williams vehicle (no pun intended) \\"RV.\\" Even though Michael uses the remote for selfish reasons, the movie is still funny until it runs out of steam is the second half. Not only does it run out of steam, it seems the screenwriters ran out of ideas. The first half of the movie is a typical Adam Sandler movie, lighthearted and mean-spirited. The second half is dark comedy, with some attempts at drama. The entire atmosphere and mood of the film change. A movie that had a new joke every few minutes now takes ten minutes to give us a joke and some of them aren't that funny. Christopher Walken didn't even get one laugh from me and he's an actor that usually walks into a movie (and he walks into alot of them) and makes it funnier. There are some scenes in this movie that are hilarious though. My picks for the two funniest scenes in the movie are when Sandler hops a fence to chase some high school kids (doesn't sound very funny, but when you see the scene it will) and when Sandler is stuck in traffic and a man pulls up next to him singing and doing some dance moves. This scene (especially when Sandler turns the volume down) should rank as one of the funniest scenes of any Adam Sandler film. The humor is very mean-spirited and there are times when Michael is a pretty unlikable character, but the movie does have it's moments but it's not worthy of many (or, possibly, even one) repeat viewing. Although, I want to add that it's similarity to \\"Bruce Almighty\\" might involve the fact that this film was written by two of the three screenwriters of that film. Look for Jack Nicholson's daughter (2007 Miss Golden Globe) Lorraine Nicholson in a very brief scene as the 14-year-old version of Sandler's daughter. <br /> <br />GRADE: C+
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|The film is gory and may not be for children but without the extreme torture we would have viewed Him as someone like Simon from Cyrene who a strong and healthy man barely held up the end of his half of the beam. The prophet Isaiah nails it when he writes of Him not resembling a human being. A moving description of this figure who's face and body is transformed into nothing. We the world then, now, and the future are \\"the nothing\\" We did this to Him and we alone are responsible for His \\"Stripes\\". No mortal man or woman could sustain such brutal whippings and live and that's not including the crucifixion. This is no ordinary \\"man\\". Whether you believe He is the only God which He is, this movie is about love and what a greater movie to have during Valentines than the love from the Father. P.S. Watch for the suprise ending, it'll move your soul.
0780619587|4.0|I knew nothing about this DVD when I bought it except what I read in the reviews on Amazon. This movie being based on a true story made it extra enticing. I was not disappointed. Once I stopped concentrating so hard on deciphering what the main character was saying, as due to his mental defect, he spoke very rapidly and repeated phrases, it was even more enjoyable. If you enjoy someone triumping over physical, emotional and social hardships, this movie is for you. I don't know if Geoffrey Rush was nominated for an Oscar, but he should have been. Excellent acting.

I would highly recommend this watch even over other more expensive examples.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I wish politicians were analyzing scientific data closer, better and with a sincere unbiased view. Many politicians just focus on money, profit/success and short-sighted advantages. Which politician would prepare his people for what happens in 50 years? We need politicians with an IQ far above 100. A must-see-movie. <br />In my eyes Al Gore should return to the big political scene. I would welcome him as president of the USA in 2008.

B00011RPB0|2.0|The subject of two lonely people, one man, one woman, having a chance encounter that blossoms into something more, is quite a common one for movies, books and TV shows.  This half-comedic take on it adds the twist of a foreign setting, Tokyo, Japan.  The man is Bob, an aging TV star flown into Japan to shoot a drink commercial.  The woman is Charlotte, a newlywed tagging along with her husband.  Charlotte and Bob meet each other by accident in a bar, and form a friendship while meandering thru the daylife and nightlife of Tokyo.  Both are married, yet neither is happy in their marriage.  Neither is willing to betray their marriage, so the movie is an extended play on foreplay and flirtation.   <br /> <br />I found this movie to be quite boring.  Bill Murray does seem past his prime, especially as a comedian, in this movie.  The dialogue between the two is realistic enough, though not that engaging.  And for a movie set in Tokyo, they could have used more famous sights as settings for different scenes.  Instead, much of the movie takes place in their hotel, or in malls, or restaurants, or other places that are quite similiar between the US and Japan.  The only worthy cinematography was the scene where they witness a Japanese couple on their wedding day.  Outside of that, the only memorable scene was Charlotte introduction, a shot of her butt in see-thru underwear to begin the movie.  How appropriate, seeing that Scarlett Johansson is one of Hollywood's new bombshells.  Otherwise, I was as distracted watching this movie as the two characters were in their stays in Japan.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|I remember watching a few episodes of the tv show 20 years ago as a late-teenager and thinking how ridiculous it was in its flash and machoism. I wasn't expecting much from this big-screen adaptation and my expectations were surely met: talk about a dud. Miscast (Colin Farrell looks as if he's trying to remember his lines most of the time; or maybe he's pondering his future, seeing as he's on his way to obscurity)and obsessively long, there isn't one scene here that rings true. Why are these two partners friends? They don't seem to have any rapport excepting a weird \\"I'm with you 100%\\" thing which comes across as just blah. And the whole relationship between Sonny and the drug dealer's money moll is laughably bad. Don't get me wrong: I like polish, but usually on my coffee table. And forget about the \\"climactic\\" showdown: it stinks too and could have directed better by a rank amateur (as opposed to a fine director copying one of his earlier climactic gun fights, and by this I mean HEAT).Stay away from this stinker.
0060899190|5.0|As you go through this collection I guarentee that you will find at least one of your own secrets.  This really is a great work of communal art.  I purchased his second and third books and plowed through them all in one night.  Some of the secrets are lighthearted and fun and others come from tortured souls who need an outlet.  Although I didn't exactly shed any tears, this book made me take a deep look inside of myself and made me realize they everybody has a story - sometimes told on the back of a postcard.

0618680004|3.0|While reading the book I decided that although Dawkins might be familiar with science, he knows very little about religion -- in particular, Judaism. He lumps all religions together. At the very least, Jews can add; we don't say that 3=1, a Christian equation that seems to bother Dawkins. Further, his Christian-centric view makes it sound like the God of the Hebrew Bible is some kind of maniacal figure. Let me just say that he is forgetting how old these books are. Compare that literature to the Iliad with its capricious gods and heroes who commit war crimes, killing anything that move, but powerless without their gods' help.  <br /> <br />Torah is the foundation of the Jewish law.  But as with any other law, we have ways of amending, reinterpreting and modernizing it.  The facts speak clearly for themselves: <br /> <br />1. While the British were still killing people for petty theft in the 19th century, Jews outlawed death penalty 2000 years ago. Not bad for followers of such an \\"unforgiving control-freak\\" God. <br />2. The Hebrew Bible established a day of rest -- the Shabbat -- thousands of years before labor unions became popular in the west. And Jewish law went even further in establishing Shabbat for animals and land. How's that for social justice and environmental protection?  <br />3. Noahide laws speak against cruelty to animals (not bad for laws framed by a \\"capriciously malevolent bully\\"). How many animals do biologists experiment on -- without even asking about the ethics of their work? <br />4. Ancient Hebrews had a centralized form of government including written and oral law, lawyers, courts of justice, a temple, and other aspects of administration more than a thousand years before anybody in the British Isles could even read or write anything (and then only due to the Roman influence). <br /> <br />Perhaps Dawkins' understanding of religion is limited to his obedience to a Christian preacher as a child. Maybe that is what's behind his making gross generalizations about other cultures that he doesn't understand.

B000LPS4BG|5.0|Goodfellas has long been one of my favorite movies.  I've watched it many times since I saw it in the theater.  I've seen it on tape, on laserdisc, on the original \\"flipper\\" DVD and the remastered anamorphic DVD, and now, Blu-Ray Disc.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that the Blu-Ray is a significant improvement over the remastered DVD.  The picture is brighter, the colors are more vivid, and many scenes have much more detail and clarity.  Of course, the overall picture is much sharper.<br /><br />Goodfellas is not the kind of movie that is a showcase for high-resolution video, however.  It has a lot of dark indoor scenes; very little takes place outdoors (something I never noticed before).  I noticed some graininess, which has a lot to do with how Scorcese shot the picture.  It's just more noticeable in the higher resolution.<br /><br />There are some minor problems with the audio in one scene.  The dialogue drops in volume and then jumps back up in the following scene.  Other than that, the audio is fine, although I would have liked a more aggressive surround mix, at least in the musical selections.  However, there's not much use of the surrounds here.<br /><br />Also, at one point there's a vertical line halfway across the screen.  Why this wasn't cleaned up is mystery to me; it lasts for about fifteen seconds.  Admittedly this is a very minor problem, but with expensive new technology flaws of this kind stand out more than they would on tape or standard DVD.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the movie and are considering upgrading to the Blu-Ray, I'd highly recommend it.  It's not an eye-popping effects movie to begin with, so this disc isn't the first one to reach for if you want to show off your system.  But it's probably the best way to watch the movie.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie show in a modern way (effects and sound, etc) what Platon told us in the classic mith \\"the cavern\\" in The Republic. You have the blue pill and the red pill, with the first one you can enjoy the effects, the performance, all that \\"hollywood\\" way in a movie. With the red pill, you can discover in every character a message.... neo, cipher,trinity, morpheus... the white rabbit, the oracle... i feel a need to watch it over and over again.
B000002KO1|3.0|By all accounts, the Pretenders should've been a great band. The had it all: a distinct sound, lots of skill (especially when it came to sadly short-lived guitarist James Honeyman-Scott), a charismatic, instantly identifiable singer (Chrissie Hynde), and a slew of catchy, hook-filled hits, all of them very good and a few found here: Brass in Pocket was the biggest of them, not their best song but certainly great. The only thing the Pretenders lacked, at least in my mind, was an album that was thoroughly good from start to finish. This, arguably their best, certainl has some good points: the aforementioned Brass in Pocket, for one. There's also their first brilliant Kinks cover (Stop Your Sobbing), the crunchy rocker Precious; Kid, pure glorious pop; and the closing Mystery Achievement. But there's too much generic, forgettable, faceless rock (The Phone Call; Up the Neck; Tattooed Love Boys; the Wait), a boring spacey instrumental aptly named Space Invader; and Lovers of Today, which drags. Ironically, what could've been the best song is probably the worst: Private Life. Interesting lyrics, and I love Hynde's vocals on this song. The problem? The song itself is a repetitive six-minute pseudo-funk vamp best suited for the likes of the admittedly better Talking Heads.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Pretenders fan, but they've got several good tunes. Inconveniently, they were all spread across their albums, rather than condensed into one. They were an extraordinary singles band (much like the Police and CCR), but not an album band.

B000002KO3|5.0|Every band has an album so good, it overshadows everything else they did, even making their better albums seem like mere trifles by comparison. For the Talking Heads, it was Remain in Light. Eight tracks of sheer brilliance: funky, paranoid, and avant-garde thanks to Brian Eno's genius production job. Loaded with unforgettable classics, namely the first four songs: Once in a Lifetime is not only the group's signature song, but arguably the greatest tune of the entire New Wave movement, maybe even the late-'70's in general; Crosseyed and Painless fuses dance with rock and avant-garde music in a way that NOBODY had EVER attempted before; The Great Curve is seductive and sensual, a rare thing for the group, with a cool distorted guitar solo; Born Under Punches has some of the best paranoid lyrics one's likely to hear, period, with an unforgettable feel to boot. This could've been a science-fiction short story, as could've the droning closer Overload, which is also first-rate. Seen and Unseen, Listening Wind, and Houses in Motion are all slightly weaker than those five, but they're all pretty good: there's not a bad song here. I'd say this is even better than Fear of Music, which is quite an achievement. If the Heads do anything for you, you owe it to yourself to buy this.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|I think this season is already better than the first.  It's so trashy and yet addictive and I love it. <br />Continuing right on from the end of last season, Amanda throws a party to celebrate her buying the building and moves into Rhonda's apartment.  As you could probably guess, she starts setting her sights on Jake who is still with Jo.  Michael gives Jane divorce papers, and plans to move in with Kimberly.  Further on in the season, the drama continues as Sydney becomes a more permanent fixture.  She's the evil and manipulative sister of Jane and she's the character you love to hate.  Michael gets addicted to pain killers, Sydney blackmails Michael, Billy and Alison get engaged (but not before various troubles in their lives) and so on and so on and so on.  <br />This has all the makings of a typical Aaron Spelling production and it is the kind of show you will take the phone off the hook for.  I love it and can't wait to watch all these episodes again.  Be warned; you will get hooked.
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|Ok, I really wanted to like this movie because I saw the previews on another movie and it looked very interesting. I guess that I should know better than to judge a movie by the previews. To me, this movie was simply awful. It was a bunch of highschool kids playing \\"gangster grown-ups\\" in a very adult manner. These kids at this age don't have that much of an organized mind to plan out such an elaborate scenario. The only reason that I gave this movie 2 stars was for the acting which was very good. The story was not believeable for me at any point in the movie. Yeah, there is trouble in the Burbs and it started with this movie.
B00005JPKC|4.0|This is the only war film Clint Eastwood should have released, though I think this film helps make the lackluster Flags of Our Fathers a little better. The acting is very good, especially the great Ken Wantanabe as the general in charge of defending this doomed island. I wouldn't go as far to say that it is a great film, but it deserves a spot on my top ten war films ever made list.
B000LPR9ZS|4.0|When I first seen SAW III at the movie theater, it is real gruesome and it was used by DLP projector with the best possible picture.  So, I had to bought this movie from Wal-Mart... on Blu-ray because I was thinking it might will look better than how it look at the movie and most ppl say blu-ray looks awful... aww please, I believe they are not watching blu-ray on High Definition Television (HDTV).  Watching blu-ray on SDTV or EDTV not going to surprise your eyes into HD...   <br /> <br />I watched this movie with an Playstation 3 that plays blu-ray <br /> <br />Now, I seen all Saw movies.. I would like to say this movie has more gore than the first and second ones... It alot of disturbing images going on in this film, a lot of strange stories and flashbacks.  If u like Saw 1 and 2.. then you would love this one far better.  <br />By the way, there will be another Saw movie... Saw 4.. the same mastermind John will return but i am not sure if this is an sequel or prequel.
B00009Z574|5.0|This album proved that Yes weren't ready to give it up yet in the age of the Punk rock prog haters. This is a strong effort and has gotten better with time.
B000EUA6DW|3.0|Minor Threat reminds me of Robert De Niro's character in Raging Bull: a film about a boxer that did not know when to give up the fight, so much that it messed him up. Yet, it also reminds me of Sylvester Stallone's character in the Rocky films: a guy who didn't know when to give up the fight, so it messed the audience's emotions up. As this four piece unit is indeed a band that hits like a boxer's deathblow, hit-after-hit into your stomach, head, and finally the heart. It does one-two-three smash in a number of ways.    First, the flaming lips of singer/songwriter Ian MacKaye are of a punchy and punky tone: lots of heavy swearing, political slander-- and certainly even more-- limited amount of properness; this band does not want to be mainstream: this is hardcore punk and it contains thunderous, super-sonic screams, with a F-you! guy attitude. Second this band knows how to play there instruments to the bone. They have a thunderous up-and-front attack to your speakers, that makes it pure head-banging music. There is no subtleness here, this is raw punk rock, not very well produced and rough around the edges, which may turn some listener's off.     However, those who look at there music with a speculative eye will find that the band makes many comments on their own stance against drugs and alcohol: certainly making them one of the few anti-establishment groups to be known for such a thing. Take the song, \\"Out of Step (with the world),\\" it contains the straightforward short lyrics: \\"(I) Don't smoke/ Don't drink/ Don't f**k/ At least I can f**king think/ I can't keep up (repeat three times)/ Out of step with the world.\\" Minor Threat tells us that we can still have fun, without these poisons that may kill us sometime down the line: in other words it shows you can live the high life with just good `ole fashioned logical thinking, and reasoning. They show this facet through their first song on Complete Discography, known as, Filler, a song about the bad aspects of blindlybelieving in religion, an anti-conformist subject often brought up in punk music.    Yet, do not worry, even if you do not agree with their outlook on life, and do not like hardcore at all, its at least a short album; as on this twenty-six song collection of their career, the songs are all only a minute or two long, sometimes even less than a minute, while the whole album runs no longer than forty two minutes. These short run times are in the classical punk mode, and they even pay homage to the British 1970's band, Wire, with \\"12XU,\\" a good cover, played with plenty of conviction.    Minor Threat may seem a little outdated in their same-sounding songs that lack much nuance. Yet, towards the last six or seven songs, the listener is awaken from their fading concentration with some pretty good tunes; especially, \\"Cashing In,\\" featuring a special homage to Wizard of Oz's yellow brick road, and its famous line, \\"There's no place like home.\\" Ian McKaye would later go on to front, Fugazi, a band that set up the genres of modern Alternative, and Emo (that is Emo when it was still more in line with hardcore punk.)    Looking back, Minor Threat was a band that along with Black Flag, and Bad Brains, laid the groundwork for hardcore punk, and even if it also showed this genre's bad attributes, Minor Threat also played some good rockin' music.      *** ½ (Out of 5)

B00013RC9I|1.0|Talkie Walkie is a waste of resources.  The distorted tones make many of the cuts sound like they are out of tune.  The vocals sound like they were recorded by zombies.  All in all, I thought it was pretty boring.  I bought the album because the last cut is pretty good.  There are a few other cuts that are not bad.  But most of it is pretty awful.
B00005MAM2|5.0|For those that didn't understand the plot or the ending , here goes. The Government did not give the main character powers. His initial contact with the escaped test subject awoke what was already in him...in all of us. If this is true then we all must carry the same genetic code as the one who created us. When in the holding cell, Kaneda was asked \\" we use knowledge & energy to create all types of things. where does all this knowledge & energy come from???\\" The main character just happened to evolve to the point where he was using the other 90% of his brain becoming more like the one who created us(GOD?). When his power became fully mature(he could not handle it, before then & up to this point)It took Akira to stop him . When the test subjects said Akira was taking Tetsuo away & \\"It's too big for us as we are now\\". They meant they were going away to create their own universe. Validated by when the professor actually looked & mentioned that the merging of Akira & Tetsuo's enregies was how the universe was created according to his readings...(BIG BANG THEORY???). So when their universe is created their genetic code,knowledge & energy will be passed down to their creations. Their creations will evolve to the point where they will be using 100% of their brain as well & the cycle would continue. This movie is interesting as it fuses religion & science. Precursor to intelligent design,evoulution or whatever they call it these days. This movie was way ahead of it's time
B000008LUN|3.0|UFO proper began with 'Phenomenon' released in May of 1974 as it introduced one of hard rock's finest guitar players in Michael Schenker. After debuting at the dawn of the 70's with two awful \\"space-rock\\" albums (1970 and 1971 respectively) the band regrouped as a recording unit and were giving an injection of talent by the arrival of a young (18 or so) German kid who barely knew English. Metal being an international language, the transition was musically smooth if not personally but the combination proved magic and saved UFO from obscurity. 'Phenomenon' was in many ways a real first album being that is not one of their acknowledged classics yet it laid the groundwork for what was to follow. Immediately blowing the doors off of the awful Mick Bolton era was the metal classic \\"Rock Bottom\\", still one of the band's and Michael's masterpieces; a real early speed metal anthem with an amazing lead break section and reintroduction of the verse. \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" has also taken its place next to \\"RB\\" in the catalogue of UFO greats but it is not as good in my opinion although it works better as a single. The rest of the record is a hodgepodge of early Schenker and some of the remnants of the band's misguided first incarnation. \\"Too Young to Know\\" has always been one of my favorite UFO tracks and stands alongside \\"Rock Bottom\\" for me, the awesome melody that Michael plays throughout really overpowers the first great piece of songwriting by Mogg and Way. \\"Oh My\\" is another solid effort but not any thing the band wouldn't blow away on subsequent albums. Perhaps to not alienate fans of their first two records (as if these losers really existed) the band still carries the space rock albatross on \\"Space Child\\", only made listenable because of Schenker (if Bolton played on it, oh man what a turd this would have been!). Nothing else is really all that memorable and the band was still one record away from their first true classic, 'Force It'. 'Phenomenon' is definitely a taster for the magic that was to come.
0375757260|5.0|It's only now that I notice the subtitle \\"novel without a hero\\", and that is what struck me most about this novel- the lack of heroes.  Indeed, just about all of the characters are flawed in some way, but I beg to differ that there is no hero.  Surely the good and honest Major Dobbin qualifies. He may be gawky and awkward, but that makes him so much more endearing than the stereotypical Prince Charming type, or reformed rascal that we might expect to see in a typical contemporary Victorian novel.    <br /> <br />In some ways, Vanity Fair is a typical Victorian novel.  There are lots of characters that can be difficult to keep track of, it is kind of soap-opera-ish, and as it covers a long period of time, it is very long, tending to drag in the middle.  However, the action really picks up in the last couple hundred pages, so it is well worth it to keep reading. <br /> <br />Another winning quality of Vanity Fair is the narration.  It is a hyperbole and parody of the typical Victorian narration. Not only is the narrator an omniscent, third-person who passes judgements, but he is a wisecracking and exaggerated one as well.   <br /> <br />I think Thackeray also deserves a lot of credit for not making the story predictable. I honestly didn't know quite how the story would wrap up, and as it neared the end I could tell that it wasn't going the way of a Hollywood movie plot (thankfully!). <br /> <br />When I  read the summary of Vanity Fair, I was led to believe that it was all about Becky Sharp and that it was her story alone.  Although you could argue in the end, it really is all about Becky and how she manipulates people, the characters of Amelia and Dobbin are too well-developed and interesting to play second fiddle to the scheming Becky.   <br /> <br />In summary, Vanity Fair has more depth, wit, and honesty than your typical Victorian novel, so I highly recommend it!
B000L5XHFO|4.0|While not the most emotional album Eric Clapton has made, \\"Me And Mr. Johnson\\" is a warm, lush and stripped-down take on classic delta blues that'll make any music fan smile. Since there's been plenty written about the music itself (see reviews of the CD version), I'll mention the record qualities.<br /><br />The recording is crystal clear, with a warm, full sound that pours out of your speakers. There's good separation between the musicians, though as some have pointed out, there's no main instrument front and center in the mix; if anything, Clapton's vocals are slightly louder.<br /><br />The vinyl itself (this is an audiophile release, after all) is ultra-clean and weighs twice what a normal LP does, so it won't wobble or flex on the deck. My copy had no discernable hiss, clicks or bumps to distract from the music, so it was all Clapton and band and no noise. It's amazing how smooth and, well, \\"non-digital\\" this release sounds.<br /><br />The only downside is that the album is just too short; you wish there were more songs to hear. For those of us who still collect records, and especially those who love great rock and blues performances, this album is definitely worth buying. Once you hear it, you'll know why.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|I'll admit right off the top that I'm a Beowulf snob.  I've read several translations, I've dabbled with the original, I teach it.   <br /> <br />When it comes to movies, I'm not a snob.  I'm eager to be pleased. <br /> <br />This \\"movie,\\" the 2005 \\"Beowulf,\\" is atrocious.  I cannot believe some of the comments made in other reviews.  Liberties taken with the text aside, this a bad movie.  It's pitifully sentimental, poorly acted, laughable in all the wrong ways and places.  The apparently intended humorous moments fall flat or shame themselves.  I was embarrassed for the actors and the producers while watching this.   <br /> <br />And I will admit, I only watched the first hour or hour and a half.  I couldn't take it after that.    <br /> <br />This is the worst movie I've seen in some time. <br /> <br />You want a great Beowulf flick, there is an \\"Animated Epics\\" version (yes, it's a cartoon) that is difficult to find but extraordinary.  In terms of artistic impression and respect of the language, et al, this version is supreme.  And it's a meager 30 minutes. <br /> <br />2005's Beowulf is awful.  Awful.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I grew up with James Bond, from Sean Conroy on. I have always enjoyed them, but this movie is the best Bond ever.  I really loved the shower scene, I have never viewed such a beautiful scene. No nudity, sex act, or camera's spinning around, It was pure and honest, Thats all it was and thats all it needed to be. I've never seen anything like it. I was afraid of Daniel Craig as Bond, I've never heard of him before, but he eats up the screen. He is 'James Bond', he's everything Bond should be. I love Sean, but Daniel is better, or maybe the writing is so much better, I don't know. If you haven't already seen it, GO! If you've never been a Bond fan, GO! <br />

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|New Jersey quintet My Chemical Romance have made a beautiful work of art. \\"The Black Parade\\", their third studio effort, is very different from their first two albums, \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" and \\"I Brought You My Bullets...\\", but this change signifies musical and artistic growth for the young band. Each song in this album follows a linear story about a young man dying tragically young and looks back at his life with a plethora of emotions.  <br /> Their song-writing has always been sincere and cathartic, driven along by their multitalented ringleader, Gerard Way. For \\"The Black Parade\\", the lyrics have matured, yet retain the raw power and honesty that make MCR special. This album is packed with truth, creativity, emotion, and life.  <br />  Very few rock albums have fully listenable and interesting songs, but \\"TBP\\" has 14 very diverse and enjoyable songs, allowing the listener to appreciate each one for its uniqueness. The epic \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" is a grande affair that gives the listener a scope of what the entire album is about. I have so many favorites on this album, but if I had to choose, I'd pick \\"Cancer\\", \\"Mama\\", and \\"Famous Last Words\\". \\"Disenchanted\\" and \\"WTTBP\\" are fantastic; \\"The Sharpest Lives\\", \\"This Is How I Disappear\\", and \\"House of Wolves\\" are chaotic, operatic, and powerful in their own right. \\"Blood\\" is a hilarious satirical ditty that proves that the Jersey boys haven't lost their sense of humor.  <br /> Buy this album; not because you want it, but because you need it.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|I was a long-time incubus fan, but now I am wondering if I've grown up and out of the phase or this album just blows.  I am going to go with both... <br />I have never heard so many cheesy metaphors or lame choruses.  \\"Love hurts, but sometimes it's a good hurt\\"??? really?  I miss the days of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself... even Morning View.  But I guess I've grown up and out of whatever kind of music they are spewing at us these days.  This pains me to write, but i think i'm done with incubus for awhile, unless there's a complete reversal from this terrible album.

B000KN7BOA|5.0|Wrapped in a snug fold-out digipak, this Rhino re-issue of Bee Gees First is a wonder to behold.  Being the first international album by the three brothers, Rhino has beautifully remastered the original into one CD that has all the original fourteen songs in Stereo and Mono.  These are different sounding recordings and not simply Stereo condensed into Mono.  Classics like, \\"To Love Somebody\\", \\"Holiday\\" and their first big hit \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\" are given new life.  In fact, the latter song has four different versions included here.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains fantastic Alternate Versions and preciously unreleased material.  Compare Barry's lead vocal of \\"One Minute woman\\" to Robin's take.  Or compare the orchestral and instrumental differences between originals and Alternate Takes of \\"I Close My Eyes\\" and Turn Of The Century\\".  It must have been a tough decision to make regarding songs choices.  The Bee Gees show a remarkable sense of humor with \\"Mr. Wallor's Wailing Wall\\" and Beatle-esque perfection with \\"Gilbert Green\\" and \\"House Of Lords\\".  With 42 songs and a running time of well over 100 minutes, this is a long awaited release.  This album made it to #7 on the Billboard charts in 1967!  Also includes a colorful booklet packed with trivia, history, album and single photos as well as comments from Barry and Robin Gibb.

Being the second album by the three brothers, Rhino has beautifully remastered the original into one CD that has all the original twelve songs in Stereo and Mono.  These are different sounding recordings and not simply Stereo condensed into Mono.  Classics like, \\"World\\" and their first #1 hit in the U.K., \\"Massachusetts\\" is given new life.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains fantastic Alternate Versions and previously unreleased material.  Compare \\"Swan Song\\" or \\"Really And Sincerely\\" to the original takes.  Also included on album for the first time are singles, \\"Words\\", \\"Barker Of The UFO\\", \\"Sinking Ships\\" and \\"Sir Geoffrey Saved The World\\".  Other new delights are the vibrant, \\"Out Of Line\\" and \\"Ring My Bell\\".  Eastern influence is obvious on \\"Deeply, Deeply Me\\" and the second CD concludes with two Christmas songs, the second being a medley never before released.  With 37 songs and a running time of nearly 100 minutes, this is a long awaited release. \\"Massachusetts\\" went to #11 on the Billboard Charts and #1 in the U.K. (Their first #1!).  The album hit #12 in the USA!  Also includes a colorful booklet packed with trivia, history, album and single photos as well as comments from Barry and Robin Gibb.
1401207138|5.0|I'm sure that the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons would agree--Alan Moore's \\"Watchmen\\" is among the great works of human literature.  The Hugo award that it won is partial proof of this statement, and it's inclusion in Time magazine's list of the 100 greatest English language novels from 1923 to present is more proof.<br /><br />But the real proof is in the pudding as they say.  \\"Watchmen\\" plays with so many themes and ideas about the nature of the human race that it would be tedious to list them here.  Suffice it to say that it is a deep work, worthy of repeated readings.  And because it's a graphic novel, it's very easy to read and plumb the depths of Moore's story.<br /><br />Which makes the Absolute Edition such a necessary thing for any hardcore fan of the book.  The digitally restored and recolored art jumps out from the heavier paper pages. The bonus material at the end gives a view of the genesis of the story.  But most importantly, it's sturdy construction will endure repeated readings, and the heavy slipcase will protect the book while it sits there looking good on your bookshelf.  This is one copy of the book that you won't lend out to a friend, never to be seen again.

B000ATQYT2|1.0|First of all: I LOVE this movie!!! I give it five stars and more! But what is your problem with selling a perfect DVD to make your buyers happy? I saw the movie years ago in Germany in the original format and language. The beautiful Song: \\"When love is gone\\" was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in Widescreen format! So... what is your problem to release the DVD with these features. Do you want to make even more money, by saying in a couple of years: \\"Sorry, we made a mistake. But here's a new DVD with all of the features for ONLY xx.xx$?  <br /> <br />I'd recommend to all of the fans: \\"DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!\\" Don't play into the hands of these big corporations!!!
B00004W3L3|5.0|I remember when this album was released. I was just finishing high school. I remember hearing \\"Kayleigh\\" and thinking \\"Huh, theres something here\\". I bought the cassette and was a Marillion(and FISH fan) from that point on. <br />It wasn't until CD's came out that this was the first CD that I bought. I bought myself a personal player slapped it in and was overwhelmed by the journey. This is a definite headphones album. The story-cycle follows a pattern and the vocals(by THE MAN Fish) and the music that accompanies this is awe-inspiring. <br />I turned more people on to this album in college than I can probably remember. It's just that good. For me it reminds me of \\"me younger days\\" whenever I listen to it. I guess this is because it was in such heavy rotation for years after I first heard it. <br />I recommend the remastered double disc, because of the sound quality and the story about how this concept by Fish and Marillion came about. Fascinating and funny story. <br />All in all, this album would please anyone who sat down, put on the headphones, and just let the journey begin.

If you aren't, you may be pleasantly surprised by what you hear or you may go ughh! If you don't like a true songwriting master who uses his voice as the \\"true\\" instrument in so many different ways to TELL THE STORY, then this is not for you. <br />My personal favorite(and worth the price for the whole package) is disc 1 \\"Brawlers\\". It's like having Jack London sitting down with you and telling you frontier tales. IT'S THAT GOOD. The other 2 \\"Bawlers\\" & \\"Bastards\\", are exceptional in their own way, but they don't have the punch of that opening disc. <br />All in all, if you like Tom's style and songwriting, dont hesitate and just buy this. Highly recommended.
B00005JPBD|5.0|Pedro Almodo`var`s `Volver' is a tale of incest, murder, family ties, and death.  Perhaps one of the most surprising and original films of the year, 'Volver' is able to switch from pathos to tenderness, laughter to tears, and intrigue to revelation skillfully and with such smooth transition, it is difficult to find any fault.  The movie is a women's tale, mostly seen from relatives of a family grieving over a mother's, then an aunt's, deaths.  But it is also a tale of men who are an incidental part in the movie.  Mostly a plot devise, the men seem more absent than the women.    Centering around Raimunda (Penelope Cruz), the family is first seen sprucing up her mother's cemetery plot.  Then, there are family get-togethers with her aunt Agustina (Blanca Portillo), sister Irene (Carmen Marna), a beautician, and sister Sole (Lola Duenas).  At home she must manage her teenage daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo) and her drunken louse of a husband, Paco.  A peeping Tom with a debased incestuous interest, he comes on to Paula, who doesn't believe him when he says he is not her real father.  The situation escalates, but then the rest of the movie gradually fits the family pieces together:  The mother's life and death, faithless relationships, and how Raimundo is going to manage between picking up employment and finishing her chapter with Paco.    Much of 'Volver' ('To Return') rings true.  It's developments are very unique.  I sometimes thought this movie was like a Spanish 'Terms of Endearment,' 'Secrets and Lies,' and 'Ponette' all wrapped up into one, but this film refuses to be pigeon-holed.  It is not unlike putting a rewarding jigsaw puzzle together with myriads of scenes and colors.  I found my jar dropping slightly from the changes and revelations that occur.  Marvelous acting and expert plot development make 'Volver' a testament to cinematic beauty and artful story telling.
B000058T5E|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed by this CD. When I heard Beck's rendition of \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" with Imogen Heap, I thought this CD would be fantastic. Instead, I found a CD that was more electronic rock than rock or blues with heavy use of the drum kit. Most of the songs didn't have any melody.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|This album blew me away. I'm not a huge follower of death metal these days but this album really revitalizes the genre. The whole Norseman theme these guys take on is very fitting to them and their sound; the lyrics are worth listening to. There's nothing I would change about this album. It has that \\"rise\\" feeling to it that most death metal bands seem to lack.
6305078564|5.0|I own this and have watched it multiple times now. It's a great \\"ladies slumber party\\" movie (thought it takes all night and then the next morning)I have seen the other studios' versions..they just don't compare. If you're thinking it's long, so maybe it gets boring? I think you will find, instead, that you're not wanting it to end! It's that good!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|a beautiful album. \\"river\\" is one of my all-time favorite songs by joni mitchell, and sarah's version is perfect.  \\"greensleeves\\" is unusual and provocative, especially for a song that's been done so many ways. i love listening to this cd even when its not the holiday season. sarah has a way of making every day seem worthy of christmas carols.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|As the owner of a spiritual (new age/metaphysical) store, I found this movie to be very interesting and informative.  Upon receiving the movie I watched only the movie portion.  One of the psychics at my shop borrowed it and viewed the entire dvd.  She watched the interviews and how the movie was produced before watching the movie.  Upon returning the dvd she told me that the informative section of the dvd was extremely helpful in understanding the entire movie and enabled her to realize that the actors were not just acting but truely believed and practiced what they are acting out.  I rewatched the entire dvd and agree with her assessment. <br />Another psychic at my shop told me that it \\"depicts how I see many of my visions.\\"  Everyone I know that has seen the movie, and I, agree that the  movie accurately portrays the personal Aura (energy field)that surrounds us all.  The lesson about the inner energy that we all posses has been withheld from the general population for a few thousand years.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about their spiritualiy or is dissatisfied or feels incomplete with their current belief system.  View this movie with an open mind that all things are possible and when it is over see how you feel.

1439110123|5.0|Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1992 this book has two parts. (In the book are five parts). The first 250 pages tell the story more interesting from my point of view. It is like petroleum became what it is today, who founded the company and how they acquired production sites. The rest of the book is purely economic policy on the control of oil reserves history.<br /><br />Highlight interesting facts to be read between the lines, for example, World War I was designed to destroy the Ottoman Empire to get their territories Near East, full of oil, under British rule. Idem, the objective of the Second World War was to destroy the British Empire and territories to pass the same control of North America. The crisis of 1973 was produced to increase the price of a barrel of oil so that was profitable to exploit reserves in the North Sea. And so on.<br /><br />It is a story of the second half of the nineteenth century and twentieth century until 1990.

9707704667|5.0|Pobre Ricardito: Este \\"pichiruchi\\" (un mal pagado traductor) ama a una chica cuyo nombre verdadero ni siquiera se enterará hasta muy tarde en su vida.     Pero despacio: La historia de amor ya comienza en el verano de 1950 en el distrito limonense de Miraflores dónde el niño bueno (Ricardo) se enamora de la niña mala quién por aquel entonces aún se llamaba Lily. Pero no dura mucho tiempo el romance. Ricardo se va a Paris para trabajar como traductor y interprete. Pero - ¡que sorpresa! - la niña mala, ahora convertida en la camarada Marxista Arlette, también se encuentra allá. Comienza otra breve romance hasta que la niña mala se fue a Cuba.     Después de su regreso a Francia a la niña mala le gusta mudarse de nuevo  y se encontrará en Londres durante la era de los hippies. ¿Y quién crees le seguirá a la niña mala hasta allá? Sí, claro: Ricardo. No voy a continuar aquí para no revelar demasiado, pero claro, hay algún punto en que cambiará drásticamente toda la historia...     Es una historia sobre traición, obsesión, decepción, una ambición desmesurada y sobre todo sobre las muchas facetas de amor. Ricardo es una persona típicamente pequeñoburguesa y la niña mala es una persona que aspira mucho a la felicidad económica. Qué va a ganar: ¿el dinero o el amor? ¿Qué crees?    Creo que hay gente - como yo - a quién le gusta muchísimo leer este libro; pero posiblemente haya otro tipo de gente a quién no le va a placer mucho ésta ultima novela del hombre más famoso de Arequipa (la ciudad blanca de Perú). El razón es que Travesuras de la niña mala es un libro bastante diferente a los demás de Vargas Llosa.     Escrito en el estilo clásico de las love-stories del siglo XX, MVLL me sorprendió grandemente con esa novela. Como ya mencioné antes, yo amo este libro. Muchas gracias Mario por ésta excelente novela!
1594200823|5.0|I have been a professioal chef for my entire carrer and feel \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" should be mandatory reading for all chefs. We are the \\"keepers of the food\\" and should feel obligated to offer our patrons the healthiest choices avaliable. The Dilemma may continue, but my passion for \\"Better Choices\\" is on fire. Thank you Michael Pollan!!! <br /> <br />Chef R
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I can't watch this show without cracking up. It never fails to make me laugh (or cry, in the case of the last season).
B000HCO83G|4.0|Cool effects. Same great actors (what happened to the Nightcrawler from #2, though? I loved him and think he should have been in this one).<br /><br />I am not entirely sure of what I thought of all of the storylines, but, it was a great flick and my family enjoys it.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|Hard to believe that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are still going strong after 20 years.  My son is now hooked on them, learning Snow on his acoustic guitar.  I first saw them years back in Gainesville, Florida, and enjoyed their punkish approach to music, but the band can no longer be written off as a joke as they have amassed an impressive discography with Stadium Arcadium perhaps their strongest effort to date.  The songs echo back to the 70s and early 80s as does so much music these days, but they are firmly grounded in the band's commitment to music and the their desire to build on their musical foundation.  The Peppers at times seem a bit too serious in their ballads, but quickly rev it up, reminding us again of their punk roots.  I think they could have paired their songs down to one disc and made a stronger CD. It is hard to imagine the megaband they have become, but it is also nice to see that they haven't taken on the pretenses that usually come with it.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the real deal.
