B007SGM084|1.0|I really wanted to give this book a chance, even though I know that \\"mommy porn\\" is not my genre.  Unless you are a teenage mom who loved Twilight and wanted the S & M version, this book is beneath your reading level.  Don't waste your time.
B006H5120E|1.0|Pure schmaltz.  Cheap romance, pathetic dialogue and special effects that look like cartoons.  I am certain James Cameron used subliminal hypnosis to convince the public to shower him with billions.  I know I'm the only one who disliked this movie.  I just had to speak up.  Thanks for the use of the hall.
B005LAII58|5.0|The Expendables are back with new members as they reunite to take on a simple job. The task looks easy for this mission, but things go wrong, and one of their own is viciously killed. The group venture out to seek revenge in hostile territory, against all odds. The crew enter into a world of destruction, wreaking havoc and turmoil as they shut-down an unexpected threat. Their mission is not complete, until justice is served against the villain who murdered their brother. Acting Performance of: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Arnold Schwartzenegger, and Bruce Willis is Superb. The drama is intense throughout, and this movie is as much of a SLAM-BANG Action Thriller as 'THE ROCK' is with Nicolas Cage. There are edge-of-your-seat thrills, and entertaining from start to finish. Highly Recommended to all action and thriller lovers!
0312641893|4.0|I'm usually a little cautious about books that become really popular, but with Cinder I had to read it if only for the cover. That said, I was so glad I decided to. Cinder is unlike any fairy tale retelling I've read. The world Meyer created is so detailed and done in such a casual way that it felt entirely believable.<br /><br />Cinder, though, is not the typical Cinderella. Not once does she wait around to be rescued from her horrible life by a marriage proposal from Prince Kai. She knows and uses her abilities, first in an attempt to help her sister, and later in an attempt to help the Prince retain control of his kingdom. I really enjoyed how she wasn't falling all over the Prince even though he is kind, charming, and good looking. It was interesting to see the discrimination she faced and how she dealt with it in a very matter-of-fact way. She wanted a better life, she wanted to be judged for her actions and abilities, yet she never sits around having a pity party.<br /><br />I did find the different ways of referring to people a bit confusing at first. Cinder is also called Miss. Linh, and Linh-mei (with an accent on the e). But after the first few times, I caught on and it added depth to the world building.<br /><br />There were a few twists thrown in and I think they'll make the sequel even more interesting. Marissa Meyer is definitely an author I will be reading more from.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I never heard of this writer before, so I was surprised how this novel kept me reading. The characters are well developed and interesting. Kvote is irritatingly gifted and  charmingly naive.<br /><br />A lot of suspense, and written in beautiful english.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is really fun and I am 16. I play with my aunts who are my friends on the game. Everything else is fun also.
B007STBUIW|4.0|The movie itself is well enough known that I won't discuss it, and I'm not one to pore over the special features, at least not right away.  Most of my review will discuss the digital formats of the Universal 100th Anniversary package.<br /><br />I purchased the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital+Ultraviolet.  Redeeming the Digital and Ultraviolet copies was relatively straightforward, although it did require I sign up for an ultraviolet account, as well as an account with an ultraviolet partner (I was provided three choices; vudu, flixster, and universal).  There were a few options for the Digital copy as well, and I elected to use Amazon.  I believe itunes was another option, as was windows media.  The Amazon option provided me with a 9.99 credit to be used towards Jaws on Amazon instant streaming, which provides you the standard definition copy labeled \\"with deleted scenes\\" (the HD version does not appear to be for sale at this time, only for rent).  I can't pick out the scenes that had been deleted previously, though it did feel like some scenes had more to them, but I've always watched \\"edited for time content\\" on TV so that's to be expected.  Both the digital copy and the ultraviolet copy have \\"redeem by\\" dates in 2015, which is a lot better than previous digital copy limits I had seen in the past.<br /><br />I was personally disappointed to only get the standard definition copy from Amazon and in Ultraviolet, but that is all the insert promised.  I have read other reviews that indicate that the itunes digital copy comes with both the HD and SD versions, as well as an \\"extras\\" download.  If you have and use itunes, that may be a better avenue for you.  Given the chance to choose again, I'd probably still pick amazon, because I buy a lot of digital content from Amazon, and I don't use itunes at all.  I may consider holding onto my redemption code, however, to see if the HD version becomes an option, though if when you get around to it the code is either expired, redeemed, or somehow bad, there is probably less that you could do to right it.

B003274QH6|5.0|The first season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" establishes the tone for Vince Gilligan's series; Gilligan was fascinated with the idea of someone who went from an ordinary guy to the epitome of evil; Walt (Emmy winner Bryan Cranston)after being pushed out of a company that he helped co-found has adjusted to life as a High School chemistry teacher married to Skylar(Anna Gunn) expecting their second child when Walt finds out he has inoperable idiotpathic non-small cell. lung cancer. Determined to leave a nest egg and to pay for his cancer treatments without breaking his family for his family after discovering how much money amateurs make creating crystal meth, Walt decides to do the same thing with the assistance of a former student and drug dealer named Jessie (Emmy winner Aaron Paul). As Walt fights cancer and produces drugs he changes profoundly. He discovers the darkness that always lurked in his soul and allows it to consume him.<br /><br />Walt also must contend with his DEA brother-in-law (Dean Norris who is marvelous and often overlooked by the Emmy committee)and the fear he will find out about his extracurricular activities and try and prevent what he is doing from both Skylar and his physically handicapped son Walt Jr. (R. J. Mitte)<br /><br />The Blu-ray for the first season looks quite nice although the show occasionally looks a bit soft. It's not a pristine prsentation but the show looks quite nice with improved detail (the video noise is occasionally a bit distracting and in the form of increased 'grain'). Before the Blu-ray I had rented the DVD set back in 2009 and it has many of the same strengths and weaknesses as this set just not quite as noticeable because of the lower resolution of DVD. Most folks probably won't notice the minor flaws in the transfer and, on the whole, the presentation is quite pleasing. Colors pop while depth and detail are noticably improved.<br /><br />The first season was shorter than all the other seasons with only seven episodes and they are spread over two 50 gig discs.<br /><br />The lossless 5.1 audio sounds marvelous and is top notch. English SDH and Spanish subtitles are available.<br /><br />The special features although limited compared to other sets. We get two audio commentary tracks on both the pilot featuring Cranston, Gilligan and a number of other cast members and also on \\"Crazy Handful of Nothing\\" on the second disc.<br /><br />We also get deleted scenes for three episodes as well as auditon footage for Gunn, Paul and actress Betsy Brandt (who plays Skylar sister Marie).<br /><br />We also get a featurette \\"The Making of 'Breaking Bad'\\" as well as an excerpt of the show \\"Shoot Out\\" about the improved quality of cable TV shows. \\"Inside 'Breeaking Bad'\\" is a series of short featurettes. \\"Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery\\" can be viewed as a slide show.<br /><br />The first season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" establishes the tone of this brilliant show--one of the finest written shows on TV--and although the first season was unnecessarily short (due to the Writer's Strike at the time as I recall), the quality of the show is high.<br /><br />Highly recommended.y are spread over two 50 gig discs.<br /><br />The lossless 5.1 audio sounds marvelous and is top notch.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I couldn't put any of the (3) Fifty Shades books down but I didn't want them to end. Especially Fifty Shades Freed. Such great books to get lost and transported to somewhere else in the evenings and on the weekend. My husband still smirks at me when I mention Fifty Shades......
0425263908|2.0|Had never read an erotic novel before and have not read any of the 50 Shades..trilogy<br />Bought this based on the reviews. Was intrigued up to about halfway , then bored, skipping over the sex scenes which leaves very little story left. Seemed very repetitious..hot, wild sex, hot wild oral sex, yeah, got that the first time. Gideon slightly  reminded me of Rourke from JD Robb ..in Death novels, and don't want that character tampered with in my brain!<br />I'm glad I tried this genre. Will not be reading book 2 and will not read \\"50\\" unless I can borrow it.
0761169253|5.0|I know this book has been around for a little while now and plenty of good things have already been said about it, but one more person urging you to buy this or borrow it from your library can't hurt.  Now, this book is not solely based on gaining your ideas from other places as the title may suggest.  While it does wonders to make you feel better about your inspirations finding their way into your work, it also touches on the way a creative person thinks and works.  It urges you to stretch and grow in ways that will ultimately help you to improve.

0440244412|5.0|What a wonderful way to end the series. It finalized the story but left enough open to let your mind wonder about Mac's future.<br />I cannot rave about this series enough. There was real hardship, real change, real devastation on the world. I haven't read a series like this.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|If you are tired of the same old story lines, then you are in for a treat. The movie stays very true to the book, and the acting is superb. I bought my DVD this morning, and I cannot wait for \\"Catching Fire\\" to be released! Enjoy!
0099579936|5.0|this books was sooo good loved it!!! I could not put it down this summer. Best book i have read this summer.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book took me on a rollercoaster ride, it had it's ups and downs but I couldn't stop reading it, but overall it was a great read and I enjoyed it.
0345803493|5.0|This is my favorite of the three books!!!! Loved it! Its super cute yet serious at the same time. I could not stop reading it I brought the book everywhere with me.
B000J103PC|3.0|This is the movie based on the best-selling book of the same title by Lauren Weisberger. Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci all do a marvellous job in their roles. Of course, Hollywood sees fit make a few significant changes from the book: Andrea's best friend isn't alcoholic, Andrea takes Emily's place in Paris under different circumstances, and Hollywood makes Miranda Priestly NICER than in the book, especially towards the end. Fun to watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a really fun game love the ice age theme its really addicting and fun my Kidd just love it as well
B0086DBE62|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Would not recommend this to anyone.... Did not even want to give it one star.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The insistent utterance of \\"oh, my\\" by the main character is irritating. While the author may find it the character's \\"trademark expression,\\" in my mind, it is a lack of creativity. The books are poorly written. To be fair, it is the type of book you may want to finish only to see what happens. However, I wanted to skip to the end.<br /><br />The plot was appears to be a soft-core version of \\"The Story of O,\\" only a pop, soft-core, unrealistic version. A teenager may believe the rather exasperating fantasy plot; but an adult will not. It proves a book can become a best seller if it hits a certain nerve in the targeted market segment. Oh my....<br /><br />If you want to read literature on M/S go for something sophisticated and literary. If you are susceptible to cheap thrills; you may like this one. I find it unsatisfactory both in writing style, plot and character development.<br /><br />\\"OH MY.\\"

B007VUA7VO|4.0|I would reccommend this app because it takes out the guess work of exactly how much energy your device has left. It breaks down how many hours are left for any particular type of usage.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|This adventuristic record returns to the techno-pop-rock formula that made Version 2.0 so remarkable.  Shirley Manson is as Shirley Manson as ever; few are as capable of conveying power, fury, optimism, brokenness, seduction, maturity, and innocence in just 11 songs.  Although Not Your Kind of People does not break much new ground sonically, it is classic Garbage, and it fills a gaping void in the current musical landscape.  Listeners will experience bouts of thrashing, crunching, guitar-driven euphoria (see: \\"Control,\\" \\"Battle in Me,\\" and \\"Man on a Wire\\").  Listeners will also become entranced by hypnotic beats (\\"Sugar\\") and atmospheric dreaminess (\\"Not Your Kind of People\\").<br /><br />Ultimately, what separates Not Your Kind of People from its predecessors is its thematic range.  One expects a heavy dose of rage and sullenness on a Garbage record, and it's there.  What is less expected, however, is the convincing optimism in songs like the title track, \\"Big Bright World,\\" and \\"Beloved Freak.\\"  When Shirley croons in the title track, \\"We are extraordinary people,\\" it is perhaps the band's boldest expression of self-acceptance in their discography.  Additionally, Shirley's interpretation of \\"This Little Light of Mine\\" on \\"Beloved Freak\\" achieves a similar vibe.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Not Your Kind of People revels in and rivals the glory of Garbage's earliest work, notably Version 2.0.  A long-time fan, I could not be more satisfied with Not Your Kind of People.  Five beaming stars out of five.
B007NR9WBG|3.0|I wish Warner Bros. could have handled this way better than it was in the latest DVD edition. According to the reviewers Brainstorm original aspect ratio for the \\"Brainstorm\\" sequences was that of ordinary Super Panavision: 2.20:1. Yet, I measured 2.46:1 on my PC monitor, which is 1080p native. The spherical shots seem to be correct, at 1.66:1 though. And in this regard, I have to agree with most reviewers that claim that both the DVD and the Blu-Ray transfers were struck from a 35 mm reduction print.<br /><br />Warner has done well with reduction prints of wide gauge formats insofar DVD is concerned. They should have disregard it when the Blu-Ray edition was considered. Surely, the Super Panavision shots look sharp, not state-of-the-art but good. However, all of the remaining of the movie look, comparatively, well below Blu-Ray standards.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I was trained by professional athletes, and almost everything they said NOT to do, Jillian does!!!  This video is full of exercises to tear ligaments, destroy the back, and guarantee you'll be seeing a doctor eventually...maybe for life!<br /><br />This is one of the worst trainers I've ever seen!  Seriously, it should be banned for completely wrong forms and routines that WILL injure people, as it has according to the60 complaints I've read from people who've used this video who WERE in great physical shape before doing this.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is a collector's item, obligatory for film fans and movie buffs. The DVD release, based on the Ultra Resolution transfer method was quite good, but easily surpassed by this new transfer. I was even more impressed with the way sound was processed, much more detailed and defined than before. Highly recommended!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I am very pleased with this excellent app. Syncs quickly and consistently. I would definitely recommend gReader. works better even than the browser version via my laptop.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I read so many negative reviews and comments about this picture that if I had to rely on them to make my purchase of the Blu-Ray I would not have it elected even on my wish list. I am glad I didn't. I know films are personal and their interpretation subjective, but at this point I must confess that I could not care less for the negative remarks about the actress who played Marilyn or their cohorts.<br /><br />It is an honest film, that shows the intimacy of a troubled, frequently intoxicated mega star. It is also sometimes moving if one understands what is really happening with the characters. The Blu-Ray edition contains a high quality transfer for both audio and video. Highly recommended to those who liked this film.
0316098515|5.0|Wow, I just cannot come to terms with the utter stupidity of some of the reviews about this cookbook. First off for the record Eleven Madison is one top ten restaurants in the WORLD and the only restaurant in its tier to do both lunch and dinner service, so no this is not just a cookbook filled with granny's recipes (btw I love my granny's cookbook) or some Rachel Ray thirty minute meal cookbook. I am really fed up with products of this fast food culture not paying homage to the chefs that are reinventing American cuisine as we know it. Please do us all a favor and crawl back under your rock and don't forget your BIG MAC........... Sorry, this is one of the best I own and I highly recommend it. The recipes are easy to follow and they are accurate, everything that I have tried has worked. Even though I have never worked for Chef Daniel I  can understand his philosophy and I am grateful that he is sharing his knowledge through this cookbook.
B007XNAQ6A|5.0|Awesome concert. Wonderful memories of seeing them live on this tour. Clearly an excellent show on a Friday night in Manchester and all the band are up to form. Great selection of new and old. The additions to the band are also fabulous: Dom and Anna particularly seem part of the band to me now. This is definitely a great buy.

1469984202|5.0|I have not been so engrossed by a story since I first read Dune. The characters are rich and complex.  The story vibrantly dark. The suspense is intoxicating. Clear your schedule. You will not be able to put these books down, until your done.

B004EPZ0AM|5.0|I was surprised to see the low rating here, but after reading the comments regarding false reviews, I understand. My kids (toddler and kinder) love this movie even more than the first. It is beautifully animated, funny, touching, and is awesome to watch on Blu-ray.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|When you are thinking about Jim Jones and his Kool-Aid while reading an over-hyped book, I think it's safe to say that's not a good thing.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read, and I feel like I got tricked into drinking cyanide laced Kool-Aid because I should have known better.  It was repetitious and the love story was so juvenile.  There was nothing insightful or earth shattering about this book at all.  It is a simple story of a gal having lots of sex with a guy, and insights on the gal's insecurities.  That's it in a nutshell, and it's repeated over and over again.  I was waiting for the other shoe to fall but I'm left feeling empty and feeling silly for buying into the hype.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|What a horrible movie.  The only thing it was good for was to up your profanity quotient for the year.  No story, no plot and what little there was was absolutely ridiculous.
1594744769|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book.The basic premise, and first few chapters were good. This had the potential to be a good book- even a GREAT book. Then the author seemed to hit a wall and the ensuing mess was both tedious and convoluted at the same time. Characters disappeared, things left unexplained. It was almost as though he gathered a bunch of weird photos together and then tried to write a story around them, and although the pics are great, there's not enough to flesh a story out of.

030758836X|5.0|This suspenseful book will have you guessing from beginning to end! Flynn brilliantly wrote one of the BEST books of all time.
030758836X|5.0|So often we tell each other \\"That was a really good book.\\" But how does one define \\"good\\"? It could mean almost anything. My definition is that it keeps me guessing, wanting more, and putting off important tasks so I can turn the next page. If the book is \\"good,\\" I want to get back to it, thank you. I have to confess it's been a long time since I read a book that I wanted to get back to this much. Ms. Flynn certainly knows how to write. No wasted words. She took me on an emotional ride, and I let her manipulate my feelings the whole time. That was the fun of it. Plus, the book is really thought-provoking. What is really going on in people's heads? And the ending that so many have criticized? Pure perfection. Loved it. Do I want more of Nick and Amy? Oh, yes. More please.
0425263908|5.0|while the plot of this book parallel's that of 50 shades of grey, it has a unique twist and i could not put it down! very excited for Day to release the next sequel in October!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is my favorite Deathcab cd.  I've had it in constant rotation for the past seven years.  The standout tracks are \\"Summer Skin,\\" \\"What Sarah Said,\\" and \\"Brothers On A Hotel Bed.\\"  It's melodic rock with a dash of emo with Ben Gibbard's emo crooning voice to finish things off.

Totally disappointed! I'm left hanging! It keeps telling me it's unavailable for purchase in the USA. I really want to read the rest of the novels.

B007TXN4TK|3.0|its fun but for some songs when it tells you to play 3 keys at the same time and you press it correctly it will tell you you missed.Really fun but they really need to fix that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Highly recommend this book. Love the authors dark & witty humor. Nick & Amy, perfect marriage or not?  Amy perfect to the world as told by her parents books. What happens when she goes missing? Told from alternating points of view between Nick and Amy. Did Nick kill his wife? Maybe it was his father? He is a crazy old man with a distaste for woman. Maybe a crazy ex-boyfriend took her for his own pleasure, Could it have been her childhood BFF gone stalker? The twists will keep you wondering. This is a must read!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|something for everyone my husband and I fight over who gets to pick the night's mix of soft relaxing music and noises. use it every night since I downloaded it.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game stands out as it is not the run of the mill match 3 or angry birds knock-off; you have to use logic in the upper levels.  Warning - it is extremely addictive!
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days by Tool is the Greatest Album of All Time, equivalent if not better than any of the very best albums produced by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Miles Davis, Led Zeppelin, etc.<br /><br />Tool creates music and sonic fields of Divine Immanence that root us in the glorious reality of being alive.<br /><br />Or as Rumi once said... \\"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field.

0440244412|5.0|Shadowfever review with major SPOILERS:::::!!!!!!<br /><br />I'm going to do my best to keep them to a minimum but there are a few things you should know going into this.<br /><br />1. Don't read Shadowfever if you haven't read the other four books IN ORDER. It's pointless and it will dilute if not ruin the journey for you. It is worth the wait. Go pick up a few paperbacks or order them online at amazon, zip through them then buy this book The pay off is worth it.<br /><br />2. You probably, shouldn't read this review if you haven't read the book yet. I'll do my best to be general but I don't want to ruin anything for you. If you haven't read the book, and you still read the review and something is spoiled for you...you were warned.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />I can't remember having anticipated a book this much. This was a remarkably satisfying journey, filled with great tension, action, and passion. ShadowFever has twists, and turns, and stunning twists again. In the past with other books before they came out, I have wanted to read spoilers.<br /><br />With Shadowfever, I didn't want to know a thing before I had the book in my hands and I'm glad I didn't because there were so many surprises, it would have (for me at least ) taken away from my joy had I known ahead of time. Just when you would think you have something figured out, another twist.<br /><br />Given the cliffhanger at the end of Dreamfever, the first 90 plus pages of this very large tome were difficult to read. I struggled mightily to get through them. I don't think it was necessary to drag out the suspense that long as to whether Barrons was dead or not. I don't think it was necessary to have Mac align herself with Darroc. It created such a miserable situation when Barren's did come back. Then the person we've thought of as the main villain, was disposed of in a shockingly quick, rushed and downright odd manner before the book was 1/4 of the way over. I did not see that coming.<br /><br />Moning however certainly took us on a journey. I don't think it is a huge spoiler to state upfront that yes....Mac and Barron's get their HEA. When Moning herself stated in an interview that no character that she has created has obsessed her as much as Barrons, I thought it unlikely that he would have not survived. His timing for his return however...sucked. I HATED that part. But it was good for the story I guess. This is what i mean, there were things that were so hard to read but you couldn't stop.<br /><br />Personally, in suspense, when lovers are (at least to me the reader/viewer)...unnecessarily kept apart for \\"the good of the story\\", when just some straight talk and honesty could cut the crap and they could work together to save the day, it is frustrating. At times I felt...jeez...we are back to where we were three books ago. The scenes with Mac and Barron's sizzle...but they are both lying to each other, or not divulging the truth, he's only showing he cares by displaying jealousy....and she's off at the Abbey, or off on a beach with V'lane etc instead of asking what to me would be some of the obvious questions that don't come up until the very end.<br /><br />But wow, when it's right. It is so right. The conversations between Barrons/Mac, both spoken and unspoken, are tense, hilarious, and sexy. And the scenes between them near the end are seriously worth five books of waiting. Never again though. I don't think I can handle it.<br /><br />There appears to be a division in the ranks of the fans as to whether the real Villain of the piece could be \\"redeemed\\". To me, it is a nonstarter, based on the Rape. End of story. If someone wants to discuss it with me in comments I'm willing to go there but I have no interest in reading in later books one where he is brought back and the love of a good woman saves him. I wish him dead. End of story.<br /><br />There also seem to be some of the fans of the Highlander series who keep talking about how disappointed they are that Barrons and Mac didn't \\"say the words of the Druidic commitment ceremony\\". I loved those books but they were ROMANCE Novels. The Fae books are closer to Horror then Romance and there would be no room for that in this series. They don't even need to tell eachother they love eachother so to have these two people suddenly start spouting loving words like that would have been insulting to the characters involved and the readers who have gone on this exciting yet exhausting 5 book journey.<br /><br />I feel for readers of romance who have followed an author and then can't seem to make the switch to Urban Fantasy, make that mental adjustment when their favorite authors do. I'm sure it is frustrating, if you expect one thing and suddenly are getting something else. You can always see them, pick them out as the dissatisfied fan in the Amazon book reviews and the forums who whine about how it isn't like the romance novels and basically I discount their opinion. That sounds harsh but there it is. Like or dislike a book based on the rules of the genre, not on your preconception from another series in another genre.<br /><br />I do however have some tiny bloody bones to pick. Moning's not telling the fans who or what Barrons is, the whole...\\"I can't tell you or I'd have to kill you thing\\" feels contrived. It is another unnecessary frustrating cliffhanger obviously intended to hook people into reading the next three books Moning has been signed to write in the series. They will focus on Christian, Ryodan, and Dani. Obviously she wants readers to buy the next books to find out the answers to those questions.<br /><br />I don't understand Mac's being so cold to Christian and leaving him in the silvers so long before getting help to get him out and who gets him out still makes no sense to me given further developments. There is also a scene that is not at end I felt would have been the resolution of the entire series that is inexplicably missing. Obviously it will be in the next series, but to me anyway...it is the wrong choice. Besides the whole Barrons/Mac/Vlane triangle, we've also been reading to find out killed Mac's sister Alina. We find out the who, but we are left hanging on how that knowledge will be handled. Mac tells us how she will handle it, and we aren't shown.<br /><br />On another note, alot of people seemed to find the character of Dani annoying, I thought she was great. I\\"m not sure why all the \\"Dani hate\\" in the Amazon Forums. I don't know that I'm ready to read a book featuring her until she grows older, but I loved her and Mac hanging out together.<br /><br />So many things were answered that I would have thought it impossible to wrap up all those threads in such a satisfying manner; who killed Alina and why, who the real villain of the piece was and why, who the Unseely King was and where he'd been hiding,(although the \\"why\\" of that wasn't ever really explained) how Mac knew the things she knew.<br /><br />Moning really did create a near masterpiece of Urban Fantasy and I will re-read it over and over. Much like Moning, I'm obsessed with Barrons and although at times I was frustrated with Mac, I loved her and think she did pretty damn well for a 24 year old who started out knowing only that her sister had been murdered and she wanted justice. It turned out in the end, justice for Alina's death would actually involve deep forgiveness, and Alina's death was only the beginning.<br /><br />Shadowfever, really is a book about shadow selfs. Facing what is deep inside and what is the truth of ourselves as well as others, and really that is as true in real life as it is in Fantasy, which is part of what makes something so fantastical, feel so real.I loved those books but they were ROMANCE Novels.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The futuristic plot was believable; the characters were well developed and it was easy to identify with them. This was a hard book to put down. It was, however, very violent and the violence was directed at young people.  Reading the first book without reading the other two, especially the third, would tend to leave the reader with a very bleak perspective.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|never heard of this movie until i was searching for something to watch.  I highly recommend this movie as one of Wahlberg's outstanding performances once again,
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and east going! graphics are good and easy to manuever. I have Oregon trail and tiny village and I completely enjoy this game:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked the back forth husband/wife \\"diary\\" format.  Not a new idea but a fresh approach on the subject.  I would definitely recommend it.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|Well, I must say, renting this was a waste of $3.99....Only because I now MUST purchase the blu-ray!!!!  I won't go into great, explict detail about the awesomeness of this movie, plenty of reviews have already gushed lovingly over The Raid.  I just wanted to, deservingly, bump up it's rating.  If you're a fan of action flicks you will love this.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|this is another great CD from Sixx A.M i love these guys product was in brand new condition and really goes well with the book . over all great experience =)
B008XG1X18|5.0|After a couple of days of not working at first I am happy to report that this app works perfect!  I highly recommend it for the Kindle Fire!
B004N44SOI|5.0|great CD i have the book and am looking forward to reading it along with the CD. the product was in brand new condition and was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed it well worth the money =)
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I think this is a mistake.  I have never purchased the Hunger Games.  I dont have it in my home.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Even though I new I was beginning a series I was still hoping after reading 800 pages that there would be a few resolutions.  Not a complete continuation of every story line.  With that out of the way, it was a well written and thought out book.  Loved the character created and the flow of the different stories as they intermingled.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game and addictive...I have accumulated a couple million points without realizing how much I have played... My favorite game so far!
0553582038|2.0|I will defend the series, but not this book.<br /><br />Everything that I enjoyed about the first three novels was absent in this one. And I am not only talking about the action elements of war. (And the dragons were never in a war, but they were absent anyway! No awesome dragons, no frightening wights, no nothing. Even the maesterly magic was teased and then dropped. WTF?!? Thanks for removing all of the cool elements.)<br /><br />Killing characters off in a series is a literary device; but denying the readers characters that have been driving the stories in order to introduce new, less interesting characters? Terrible.<br /><br />Deciding on specific regions for the focus of plot development is a literary device also; but arbitrarily turning attention to one region in order to introduce new, less interesting plots? Terrible.<br /><br />Teasing storylines so that you edge the reader along is a literary device; but never bringing any resolution - not even to your subplots?!? - Terrible.<br /><br />One of the above would have been forgivable. But all three at the same time? Terrible. TERRIBLE!<br /><br />It's why the Catelyn Stark teaser at the end of the last novel gets a scant, almost forgettable entry here.<br />It's why the Gendry/Brienne subplot is never developed; just another tease.<br />It's why we are forced to watch Sansa do absolutely nothing.<br />Forget about the awesome characters that were absent altogether - why not at least develop storylines for the ones who are included?!?!?!  AAARRRRGGGHHH! Arya, Sansa, Cat, Jon, Littlefinger, Nymeria the direwolf, Kevan, Margaery... even Jamie was not explored enough, and he was the most interesting character in the entire book.<br /><br />Cersei?!?!? OK, we get it. She's a paranoid psychopath. Every Cersei chapter is basically the same, and according to Ser Helpful above, she gets 22.5% of the book.<br /><br />I kept wondering if a ghost-writer was brought in. I can only hope that this never happens again, and that we get back to the basics.<br /><br />It just wasn't good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun and addictive.<br /> my kids love to play and are better at it and faster than I am. I think it will help keep my mind sharp.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app! It has all the weather info you need in a clean and easy to use format.
B0086700CM|5.0|Move over angry birds, I think I found a new obsession. Fast and high quality. Got to collect all those coins!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so excited to see an official Pinterest app for kindle fire. I was previously having issues with the site both mobile view and desktop view, mobile works fine for me now, but still so glad to see an official app, especially a free one! working great for me so far no issues logging in or repinning, haven't tried creating pins yet, though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E.L.James doesnt care what you lot think, as shes cashing her multi million pound cheque.<br /><br />I admire people like her and George Bush..<br /><br />It shows any idiot can do well.
B0086700CM|3.0|Fun game, good time waster, but app graphics/gameplay suddenly became sluggish after phone updated to Android ICS, making it almost unplayable. Disappointing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is my first review of a book purchased thru Amazon and read on my Kindle. It was a great experience for a senior citizen. I learned more about the computing hardware and software industry and the salesmeanship it takes to become successful. Also it introduced me to the ease of not carrying books to a country in Eastern Europe where I live six months a year and travel about most of the time. I only wish I had started this when Kindle was first introduced from reading the biography of Steve Jobs a truly remarkable man.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this app is amazing!!! it is a knock off of where is my water, but this one is awsome LOL
0741470314|4.0|As a MICHAEL JACKSON admirer I found the book interesting and enjoyable. It will certainly open the eyes and minds of those uncertain about the complex difficult life Michael Jackson had to endure not only by the media but by the circle of so called advisers around him. Have an open mind as 'DEFENDING A KING' is factual. The only thing I found frustrating, certain statements I wanted more information about. Totally recommend a read.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The kindle version claimed it came with X-ray enabled content. When purchased it came without the X-ray. It took 3+ weeks of getting that figured out. Eventually repurchasing three times finally fixed the content. The X-ray content was the reason I was purchasing via amazon. Every customer service representative said something different about X-ray content. First said it wasn't and that it was an error on the site and the website would be changed as soon as possible. Then a week later it was still up. I contacted and there was a long back and forth. Apparently it was always enabled. Repurchasing the book didn't give me the content though.<br /><br />This was the biggest debacle I had seen in a while.<br /><br />However, the book is a good read. I haven't seen any glaring formatting errors. But I was hoping for X-ray enabled content for this book so I docked the star.
B00846REIS|3.0|Let me just start by saying I enjoyed this book, it's written well and keeps you turning the page. However the similarity between bared to you and fifty shades it very much the same.  The only thing this book has that fifty shades didn't it the fact that he appears to be a much better boy friend to her. It was a great book in my eyes because I love the was Gidion is in the book i'm very excited for the next one.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The advertisement take up too much of my phones screen space.<br /> A paid version without ads would be great .
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book! It took me awhile to actually start reading it because the premise of the book seemed so far outside my normal reading parameters. However, once I finally started I read the book in one sitting! Very easy read! Loved the story!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|only some games are unlocked right away you have to get points to unlock all others so it is time consuming
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|yeah its pretty good. I like the interface it makes it easy to use. it works really good with iftt
B007J4T2G8|2.0|THIS BOOK GOES ON AND ON ABOUT A WOMANS MUSHY FEELINGS FOR A MAN SHE JUST MEETS AND IT DOES SO FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST FIVE CHAPTERS, THAT IS AS MUCH AS I COULD STAND TO READ.<br />I UNDERSTAND HOW SOME WOMEN MAY GET AND HAVE GOTTEN WRAPPED UP IN THIS 'DRIVEL' BUT I THINK MOST MEN WILL STOP READING IT LONG BEFORE I DID. I ONLY LASTED THIS LONG BECAUSE I WAS SURE I MUST BE MISSING SOMETHING, I WASN'T.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I feel like an idiot for ignoring the other reviews here, and buying into all the hype to read this book (and also for buying the 2nd book hoping it would be better). Without exaggerating, this is one of the worst books I've ever read! It's not only very poorly written but also very poorly edited. I'd give it negative stars if I could. Although most of the characters are Americans in their 20's,  they use terms like \\"go to the cinema\\", \\"smitten\\", \\"rucksack\\" and many others that are clearly British and/or very dated. The sex scenes become so repetitive and pointless,  seemingly used as filler, that I started skipping over them. In fact, \\"repetitive\\" is a good term to describe most of this book,  as the author uses the same descriptive terms and phrases over and over and over again! They actually became laughable to me. The whole book and, judging from about 1/3 of the 2nd book I was able to stomach reading, probably the whole trilogy should be considered as an insult to every reader's intelligence. PLEASE DON'T GET SUCKED INTO THE HYPE LIKE I DID! Don't waste your money or your time on this book!
0061726834|4.0|I don't know how to feel about this book. I liked it, but I didn't. I liked the whole concept with the way the book twisted everything we believe in about love into something so evil and infectious and wrong. But then there was something about it that I don't like, and I just can't quite put my finger on it.<br /><br />I don't really know how I feel about the characters. But I did like Hana and Alex, but I didn't really just fall in love with the characters like I usually do. Lena got on my nerves throughout most the book, except towards the end when she started actually doing things and standing up for herself. Other than that she was pretty much a bore. To me she didn't really have a backbone to say how she really felt and do what she felt was right. I know she had her inner struggle going on and all, but it took her damn near the whole book to finally do something about it. I also didn't like how just, boom, I am now all of sudden in love with Alex?! But anyways, enough with the boring about her, she did have some positives.<br /><br />Like I said before, I didn't start liking Lena unless I about 3/4 of the way through the book. She finally started standing up for herself and when she figured out the truth about her mom, I thought she reacted just the way she should of. It showed she had true emotions instead of the ones she thought she should feel. The government had the people's mind so screwed up, it was sad to see. I thought Hana was awesome and I hope to see her in Pandemonium.<br /><br />This book did keep me entertained. It wasn't all that suspenseful but it did have its moments and I really enjoyed the romance between Alex and Lena! I did like the book and enjoyed it. But it took me a while to truly get into it and I felt it could of been better. But that last chapter of the book just pissed me off! lol I really hope that Alex isn't what my mind wants to believe because I thought he was awesome and he was such a sweet heart and always looked out for Lena's best interest.<br /><br />I'm glad I already Pandemonium so I can continue the series :) and to see what happens next! Hopefully it doesn't have an ending like this one.s best interest.<br /><br />I'm glad I already Pandemonium so I can continue the series :) and to see what happens next!

By playing each game you earn points to buy more mini games. I really like this app and it has tons of fun games to keep you entertained for hours.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I don't think I've ever read a full blown prequel before, but everyone knows that I loved The Maze Runner Trilogy by James Dashner. I have to be honest, I didn't even know there was going to be a prequel to the The Maze Runner trilogy. So when I seen Kill Order on Netgalley, I did a little happy dance :) I didn't know how I would feel about it, but...Here's what I thought.<br /><br />I really liked the whole idea of this book. You get to see how everything got started, which was actually pretty amazing, but also very sad. (From the Sun Flares that destroyed the world to the The Flare that infected the living) At first I didn't know how I felt about the whole present to past point of view switch. But, then I realized the greater role it played in the story of us learning how everything got started.<br /><br />The characters, I enjoyed. Trina and Mark were similar to Thoma and Teresa in some ways, but not all. Their bond as friends were something that I enjoyed reading about. I also liked Alec, he was hilarious at times, but he also took the role as leader. It was kind of weird seeing an adult take the lead, when in the Maze Runner, it was nothing but kids.<br /><br />But there are some cons to this book.<br /><br />I don't know what it was, but I found that as I was reading it, I couldn't stay focused. I'd read like 40 pages and then my mind would start to wonder. That's the reason why I rated this 4 stars. I also felt like there wasn't enough story to the book at times. I mean don't get me wrong, I love a good action packed book, but I felt that there was a little too much action and not enough 'meat' to the story. (for lack of a better word)<br /><br />But in other aspects, I now have some unanswered questions. The ending of the book which is basically where Thomas first came into play. Was DeeDee Thomas's mother or was she the lady who came to pick up Thomas? Or was that not her at all? Did she even make and survive? I am so confused!<br /><br />But overall, I did enjoy the book and the story. It just took a little while to get into. Thanks to Netgalley for approving me of the E-ARC. All thoughts are my honest opinion.enjoy the book and the story. It just took a little while to get into. Thanks to Netgalley for approving me of the E-ARC. All thoughts are my honest opinion.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I won't spoil it for everyone.  The review says it all. I'm an all out action girl and I love comedy.  I didn't very much like the first Movie.  The second one, A Game of Shadows, is so action packed and is at times too funny!  The best part is, you don't need to use your brain to follow this one.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Che piacevole sorpresa! Iniziare la visione e constatare la presenza della traccia audio, nonche' sottotitoli, anche in italiano: esempio raro, se non unico, nei miei acquisti diretti dagli USA. Quanto al film, beh ogni commento appare superfluo. Basti dire che siamo di  fronte ad uni dei capolavori di film musicali che oggi, ahime', non si producono piu', vuoi per le musiche, che per le coreografie, e gli interpreti. E che interpreti!  Il trasferimento in blu ray e' splendido, colori brillanti e ottimo audio originale. Classico che vale la pena di rinnovare oggi  che finalmente esiste in alta definizione .
B001FB55I0|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen.  I still love it now.  Great movie, ton of action and great acting.  If you love buying action movies, this one is one to buy.
1608871045|5.0|made in a scrapbook style, with all kinds of extras and blue-prints with excellent photos. i bought it for a gift, now i have to buy a 2nd one for myself.  a must-have for DARK KNIGHT fans :)
B002ZG99A4|4.0|What can I say, I'm an action girl.  The action is good.  I love Jet L. I love the knife throwing and the kick butt action.  It's not one on one fighting, nor either one or the other dies.  You really don't know who is going to off who, when, or if it's the original fighter that's still alive to get some revenge.  The only thing that ruins a movie is some bad acting by the Leader of this Island , a cameo or 2, and something/ someone at the end that leaves a bad vibe. Great movie tho.  Glad I bought it.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This has to be seen as a ground breaking contribution to the sexual liberation of women and one which will whip up much enthusiasm in the sex toy industry.<br />I found it gripping, I was bound to each page and now understand the erotic effects of expensive cars, helicopter flights and wealth in tying up of sexual stimulation as experienced by women.<br />My  attempts to follow this good example has been frustrated because the local equestrian center has sold out of whips and straps.<br />I am saddened at thought of what Lady Chatterley missed.<br />I look forward with lascivious anticipation to the next world best seller.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|I feel that one of the only reasons I bought this movie is because H. Ford is in it. Not to much drama. Not scarry. Not much gun fighting. It wasn't as action packed as I had hoped.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Gabourey Sibide, as Precious, is every bit as good as I've heard. The script has some problems, but not with the part of Precious. Her character is inspirational without being unrealistic. We like Precious, we feel empathy for her character and her circumstances, but we're not manipulated into liking her.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this film - and it's not really the fault of the film - is that it seems to focus all of the \\"blame\\" on the mother and father. I think that this was a dramatic decision that was made, and it wasn't meant to ignore all the other factors which create the kind of environment that kids like Precious live in. When a movie depicts a rough life in the ghetto, that doesn't mean it has to get into all of the complicated stuff that creates ghettos in the first place. Nor does it have to get into what we, as a society, could do to help kids who are trapped in toxic environments. It's all too easy to hate and blame the parents, but for ignoring the rest of it I was going to give this movie three or four stars. After I thought about it, I saw this film as a powerful slice - a small slice - of a big problem that we have in America. I realized that the narrow perspective, the narrow focus, also distilled the power of this drama. This is a powerful drama, not a comprehensive documentary.<br /><br />Some critics see this film as depressing, stereotyping, exploitative, etc. I don't see any of that (except for depressing, maybe, but not all movies can be about happy circumstances, right?). I've not seen anyone make a good case of how the film exploits anyone, and the mere fact that it depicts abusive black characters in a ghetto doesn't \\"prove\\" that it's stereotyping, any more than a movie depicting abusive white characters is stereotyping. The unfortunate fact is that there is plenty of abuse going on in America. To be guilty of stereotyping, a book or film must imply that ALL people of a certain class or ethnicity behave in a certain way. This film does not do that. Also, let me suggest that if this film was about a white girl living in the ghetto, getting abused by white parents, it would be just as powerful, assuming that the white girl was as good an actress as Gabourey. :-)<br /><br />A minor problem I had with the film - and this is a personal quirk of mine - is that all of the \\"good\\" people were physically attractive. The teacher at the alternative school, the case worker, Nurse John. If this film is guilty of one stereotype, then that's it: Good people are good looking. Of course, the notable exception here is Precious herself, but I think the film subtly implies that Precious might not be obese if she had grown up in better circumstances. That being said, the teacher, and her girlfriend, and the case worker (Mariah Carey) were all beautiful, so I'm not complaining too much. It's a movie, after all. The thing is, I know that people who are beautiful inside come in all kinds of packages, and I think Hollywood sometimes forgets that. :-)s film does not do that.

B003DWC6LI|5.0|OK, I don't know if this was the first \\"chick lit\\", but although I'm now almost twice as old as I was when I first read it, it's still one of the best books about in this genre.<br /><br />Fielding manages to satirise and amuse whilst still giving us a main character who is warm, funny, engaging, and amusingly inept without being tiresome. No cringy Bella Swann \\"I'm so clumsy, isn't it charming?\\" guff going on here! Bridget is someone we all either know or have been at some point; we can cringe with her parental embarrassment, sympathise with her hangovers, and hope with her for a relationship and not being eaten by an Alsatian.<br /><br />Still one of the funniest, most enjoyable, and (deservedly) best known chick-lit heroines, Bridget is a welcome addition to my Kindle.

0345803485|1.0|I really do not want to use the word \\"stupid\\", but I can't come up with another word which describes this book more accurately. It is a combination of a silly teenage girl book and an oafish magazine you read an a too long flight. The characters are dull, the story fatuous, the sex bad. Really wonder who and why people like this book. With so many great books around, do not waste your time on this one.

B001DM1VXE|5.0|I don't know if this is as good as my rating, but it's so odd, brave,<br />idiosyncratic and haunting, that I want to forgive it it's flaws.<br /><br />Made on a shoestring, but using those limitation to create a unique<br />look and style, this is a psychological thriller about paranoia and<br />ideas, that puts you inside the lead character's head as he slowly<br />cracks up, trying to figure out the mathematical basis of all life. He<br />gets mixed up with Hassidic Jews who think he may have found the true<br />name of god, and wall street traders who want his secret for riches.<br /><br />Full of surreal touches, it's not always clear what's real and what's<br />in our lead character's head - but rather than being annoying, that<br />only pulls you in deeper. To me it recalled great surreal earlier films<br />like \\"Eraserhead\\", and \\"Seconds\\", but on speed.
B0050VI5SI|1.0|You heard it all throughout 2011.  &#34;Pumped up kicks&#34; off their &#34;Torches&#34; album got alot of airtime, you heard it on Y100, 97.3 the Coast, 97.9, 101.5.  You mean when you're parents purchased those cool pair of Nike's for the new fall academic year!?!  Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0042GNDT8|5.0|If you want to listen to some of the best renditions of Richard Strauss ever recorded, then buy this set right away. Reiner was an expert at conducting Richard Strauss.<br /><br />The sound quality is even better than on modern recordings.<br /><br />In particular, the excerpts from Elektra and Salome are possibly the best performances I have ever heard from these operas.
B004UJ6YNO|1.0|The unmelodic beats, and way the words to the song are sung make you think you're sucking on a lemon.  &#34;Price Tag&#34; off her &#34;Who You Are&#34; album is a gem.  Interesting how the song is not even about that.  I eventually realized to start welcoming the refreshing value of the tune.  I bought it here off Amazon from the &#34;Who You Are&#34; album.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This product came with an open box that had been taped back together. Not to mention that there were no instructions included. Not too happy.
B0056369RO|1.0|A hodgepodge of mashed up electronic beats signifies why they titled it &#34;Party Rock Anthem.&#34;  I suspected guys love this tune.  I tried to give it a 5-star rating, because I am its only hater!
B003BWERF8|5.0|Pairs flawlessly with my[[ASIN:B0085OU6Z2 JLab Go Wireless Bluetooth Headphones - Blue]] everytime.  Signal strength is really good it works up to about 30 feet away, signal does cut out a little with the ipod and transmitter in my pocket, but overall a great product.
B004HYXW1O|1.0|The intriguingly poignant combination of melodies, beats,.. the bass, guitar,.. drums, produces a melancholic sound.  It literally pulls the listener in.  When the singer's ..&#34;nothing..&#34; first occurs and breaks and falls is my favorite part, and that's just &#34;Nothing.&#34;  It's on my playlist loving it.  Another great song on this particular album is &#34;For the first time.&#34;
B0021L8UQ2|3.0|The movie is good , but in the end , someone have a lapse , I don't now if a editor or director, but ....<br />I try to tell , my friends is the movie goes great and 5 min to the end of the movie  the guys goes bananas and crap the movie.<br />It's a horrible fault make this mistake, great movie that going down in the end, incredible!
B003Y2XI8W|1.0|Once again, I was in Pembroke Lakes Mall in one of the stores, &#34;Tilly's,&#34; when I first heard this song.  It's pretty fast for such heavy beats.  It can be compared to MGMT's &#34;Kids.&#34;  This song just debuted so I know I purchased it from this site.  I don't have my laptop with me right now, where I know exactly all my Amazon.com purchases.  Loving it!
B0072GPQ72|4.0|Exremelly well maid war drama, but very depressing at times, maid me want to cry a few times. Happy ending was a big plus, cheered me up! Some historical errors.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would recomend the movie for the whole familly.

0385737955|5.0|What would you do if you woke up in a lift with no memory? Thomas found himself in such a situation where the darkness and the motion of the lift does not help him much. When the lift finally arrives at its destination he steps out to a completely different world called the Glade. Even with almost no conscious memory, Thomas knows from the very beginning that the Glade is different from the world he belongs to. Slowly he gets acquainted to the lifestyle at the Glade, where everybody works and has different sets of responsibilities. His instincts tell him from the very beginning that he is supposed to be a runner - the group that ventures into the dangers outside the Glade walls and into the Maze. Not everyone is happy about his arrival though - the Gladers who have gone through the `change', especially Gally is angry with Thomas for some reason. But Thomas doesn't get enough time to get answers to all his questions as the very next day, for the very first time a girl is sent into the Glade - breaking the rule of a boy a month. The girl's arrival and her comment about a `trigger' gives rise to new questions and suspicions. What is the Glade? Why are they here without any memories of their past lives? Will they ever be able to get out of the Glade? What is the purpose of the Maze?<br /><br />Thomas seems like a very strong character from the very beginning. Landing up in a different world with no memories of his life so far is bound to confuse and scare people. Thomas takes it all in a stride, well better than rest of the Gladers anyway, and starts to learn the ropes in his new environment. Teresa's arrival is well into the story and she spends most of her time in a coma. So, we do not see or hear much about her. But man when she awakes - she plays a very crucial role. There are a quite a few other people who plays important roles in this book. Newt is an ex-runner. Minho is the current leader of the runner. Frypan is the keeper of the kitchen and Alby is the leader of the Glade. All these boys are very brave and likeable. But for some reason I liked Gally too. He seems a bit crazy towards the beginning and is angry with Thomas, but his last action in the book really redeemed him.<br /><br />James Dashner has built an awesome world of his own with the Glade. Though it is a bit slow at the beginning, the story has an amazing plot with great characters and a hell lot of twists. I guess the slow start was a necessity to build the setting, the plot and the characters not only for this book but also for the sequels. The dark secrets, the flashes of memories, the horrible creatures in the maze, the `trigger'... everything has a purpose in this book. This book has a lot of action, drama and the bonds created in the Glade.<br /><br />This book elicited similar reaction from as The Hunger Games and now that I look back on both the first books in the Trilogy, I personally think that the Maze Runner Series has a lot of promise.f the Glade. All these boys are very brave and likeable. But for some reason I liked Gally too.

B003KRLKHC|4.0|Did not have an opportunity to see this when it was in the theater but wanted to.  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Parts felt like an updated Mad Max (which I enjoyed way back when).
B0084IG7KC|1.0|so said you could watch it at 1201 , so I paid for it and now its not in my video stuff grrrr stayed up for nothing, guess I will have to wait till next week now unless i want to spend money again with xbox
0823003035|5.0|the author provides an alternative to the traditional stick figure, cylinders, and preconceived shapes that many other books teach. The approach allows the artist to rid themselves of adding in bias into the drawing. great book!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The first reviews I saw from people were from people that didnt like it.. Honestly, before I even read ANY customer reviews from this website, I had picked up the book from Wal-Mart and read it. I LOVED IT. Yes, there are times where I get a little annoyed from words being used wrong or a word is obviously missing from a sentence, but all in all, I enjoyed the storyline. I've never read a book like this with this kind of story.. it was definitely not what I expected it to turn out to be..<br /><br />I liked it so much that when I wanted to re-read, and my co-worker borrowed the book I got, I bought it on my amazon kindle application just to do so.<br /><br />There are books that I've read after reading 50 shades that have 4-5 star ratings.. but when I read the book it turned out to be dull.. and for this book it's the opposite. I liked it a lot, but it doesnt have such a great rating..<br /><br />I say, to each his/her own! you'll never know if you really like something or not until you give it a try..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It felt as if the pages were made of super glue, I couldn`t put it down. I would give it more than five stars if i could.i am sure there isnt and never will be a better book.

0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson has a great life.  He gets to just set out galavanting through Europe at will, then scribble down his musings.  But what musings they are.  Reading this was an introduction to a different kind of travel writing.  Most books set up a city, then give hotel and restaurant recommendations.  Bryson never mentions any business by name.  The book is more about his personal journey than being able to replicated it on your own trip to Europe.  If only we could all have such carefree journeys as this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! The way it is arranged makes it easy for anyone to find the verse they are looking for with ease. I also like the fact that I can download different versions onto my device. I use it often and would not want to go back to life without it.<br />The downloaded versions especially comes in handy once I am in the subway tunnel.
B0071K5KWU|5.0|In my 2004 Amazon review of Tony Banks' debut classical work, \\"Seven,\\" I wrote it marked \\"a new beginning for a very overlooked songwriter and composer.\\"  Thankfully, \\"Seven\\" was indeed this new beginning I was hoping for, and the subsequent result is what I was looking for and then some.  With \\"Six,\\" Banks now takes us deeper into the realm of classical music, augmenting his writing for orchestra with two stellar pieces of music for soloists.  This work again proves Banks is hardly in retirement with his great writing talent; as usual, he rewards listeners with a wide palate of tone color and imagination.<br /><br />The album opens with the most melodic and interesting work of the six.  In \\"Siren,\\" Banks employs saxophonist Martin Robertson (who has actually recorded sax on some of Banks' solo albums) to handle soloist duties.  Robertson's solo playing is very well paced and nicely compliments the orchestra.  I call it the most interesting work because it seems alto sax (or indeed any sax) is largely overlooked in classical music.  It was nice to hear it front and center in this work.<br /><br />The other work for soloist on the album is \\"Blade,\\" featuring violinist Charlie Siems.  While this up-and-coming musician is largely known to British audiences, Siems playing on this work is very impressive indeed, and should be a fine introduction to an American audience.  The crashing chord at the beginning of this work certainly catches your attention, anticipating greater things to come, and Siems does not disappoint.  Banks notes in his liner notes \\"Blade\\" could have worked as a rock song.  While there are hints of that flavor present, the piece still holds up nicely as classical fare.<br /><br />While much talk will probably be made of the soloists, the other pieces that complete the album are just as captivating.  \\"Still Waters\\" is a piece that starts off slow but progresses into something with surprising melodic depth and emotion.  Likewise, \\"Oracle\\" develops into abeautiful little tune.  \\"Wild Pilgrimmage\\" is a piece I wasn't particularly thrilled with at first, but subsequent listens have proven my first impression wrong.  There are quite a few subtle nuances in this piece that become more apparent on a second listen.<br /><br />The final work of the album, the epic \\"City of Gold,\\" is a long piece reminiscent of Banks' \\"Island of Darkness\\" from his \\"Strictly Inc.\\" album.  The adventurous feel to the music for this piece seems to set it apart from all of the other works, and it was a great choice to end the album on.  I couldn't help thinking though if there was more of a subtext to this piece.  A \\"City of Gold\\" is not particularly new imagery in the world of Genesis.  It made an appearance in the Genesis song, \\"Trick of The Tail,\\" which Banks also wrote: \\"Bored with his life in the City of Gold/he left and let nobody know.\\"  I wonder if perhaps this grander piece is a sequel or prequel to that earlier song.<br /><br />As with \\"Seven,\\" Banks showcases some interesting melodies and chord structures that make for a remarkable musical journey.  It would be interesting perhaps to see Banks attempt some other classical music landscapes with future projects.  A piece with piano coupled with a violinist or some other solo instrument (or even a voice) would make for an interesting idea.  So would a string quartet or piano quintet.  Whatever the end result, Banks' writing will most certainly make it something worth hearing.

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I had only heard of Halestorm from a link on YouTube while listening to Evanescence probably six or so months ago and fell in love with Lzzy's voice and her punk-ass attitude.  Before Halestorm I wasn't a big fan of the punk/rock genre, but I went ballistic after that first song.  This was before Strange Case Of came out, but by the time it did I was screaming Lzzy's notes to Here's To Us on Youtube.  Now that I have I can say that I have never had an album that I liked every single track on besides Born This Way, and now I add this to the list.  The music is hardass and at some points slower and beautiful.  Its all I love about Halestorm is their versitility and also Lzzy's WOW-ing voice makes you just scream the lyrics in painful bliss almost, its just a very clever album, and just as good, if not BETTER in my opinion the Halestorm in 2009.  I would recommend this to anyone regardless of what music they like because they changed my mind on the genre they perform on.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a good app. it's the best!!! I would highly recommend this for everyone who has a kindle fire.  it lets you know when your battery is getting low. I love it so much.
0307949486|5.0|I recieved this book from a co-worker, I saw the movie and soon after wanted to read the book.  I finished the book in two weeks.  I fell in love with Larsson and Lisbeth Salander.  I reccomend this to people who want to read something fresh, thrilling, and adrenaline pinching.
0439023521|5.0|I read a lot,and I often enjoy Y. Adult books.This was being talked about a lot so I read it on my Kindle.I was honestly shocked at how much I liked this dystopian style story.Katniss is a strong female lead who does not rely on a boy to live,in fact the boy relies on her!She is tough because she had to be.This is defiantely worth reading!
1435122968|4.0|Do not read the introductions before reading the stories since editor S. T. Joshi often gives away crucial bits of their plots or aspects of their narratives that spoil elements of their mystery. In fact, since I found the editor's critical opinions worthless, I soon began to pass over the introductions even after reading the stories.
1476712042|4.0|Just finished this book based on all the rave reviews.  I enjoyed this book, however I did not give it<br />five stars as I felt it was a little drawn out.  I thought to myself that they (Abby and Travis) just needed to get on with it<br />already.  How many times can you break up character's and get them back together?  With that being said I<br />did love the story of the two.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. It seems that Fifty Shades was written for young single women who have a confused idea of love and commitment. I do not recommend this book for any one with half a brain.
B005QUQP76|1.0|When I bought this mouse, I loved the way it worked.  The DPI sensors and the sniping button were perfect for my use.  However, it stopped maintaining a stable connection to my computer within the first month.  I got a replacement, and it had the same problems within a week.  Were it not for the fact that this mouse does not last anywhere near the 2 year warranty it gives on the box, I would recommend this mouse, however, given the fact that this mouse that can't reliably make it past a month of regular use and that it doesn't reliably stay connected to the computer when it is \\"working,\\" I cannot recommend this mouse to anyone.
0307887448|5.0|Whew! I finished reading this in 5 hours flat. From the first page to the last, it's chocked full of references from the 80's. I really enjoyed this book. It was a really fun read for me, since I used to love all those old arcade movies and 80's sitcoms and movies! A lot of the writing wouldn't be what I'd consider to be \\"literature highbrow\\" but I really think that the cheese factor was actually intentional. I enjoyed the characters. I enjoyed the premise and most of all, I enjoyed the picture it painted about the future in video games. If you enjoy SecondLife, EVE Online and World of Warcraft, you'll enjoy this book's tale.<br /><br />I was born in the 70's, and grew up in the 80's and this book definitely gave me a sense of nostalgia. The only thing that bugged me was the sheer amount of time Wade would have had to dedicate to studying all this stuff...and it just didn't seem possible that he'd have enough time to actually watch, listen and read all the content he purportedly went through in that time frame. That's my only minor issue with the story.

B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This is a movie filled to the brim with action and adventure; if you enjoy a wild ride action movie this one should leave you fully satisfied. The pace is essentially non-stop from beginning to end with fighting, action, intrigue, and adventure.<br /><br />One reviewer compared it to Pirates of the Caribbean and that's probably a rather good comparison. One thing you should not expect is the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Although there may be a few hints of Doyle's' literary Holmes character the movie creates a very contemporary Holmes in the spirit of the first Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr. In other words you'll enjoy this one if you enjoyed the first one. If, on the other hand, you're a devoted fan of Doyle's Holmes you may be disappointed in this version of the famous fictional detective.<br /><br />For a general action/adventure movie it does a good job; if that's what you're looking for you should be satisfied with this one.
0345529057|2.0|Let me start by saying this review is not about the actual books.  I read the first book, that I checked out from our library, and it was good.  So I decided to get the whole series in one shot while saving a Few dollars.  The library edition had xray and page numbers.  the way the picture was displayed I thought I would get 4 individual books downloaded onto my kindle, but I was wrong.<br /><br />This particular bundle comes in one giant file, no xray, and the page numbers did not work.  I think it is really sad that the publisher is essentially selling a different and inferior product for essentially the same price and that is what mad me mad.<br /><br />With a story this detailed it would be nice to be able to use xray and note the page numbers.<br /><br />Otherwise I enjoyed the first book and look forward to the others.
1451608659|5.0|Frankly I'm surprised just how much I enjoyed this book. Off the top of my head, it ranks as the best personal memoir I've ever read. I was not familiar with Dominique Moceanu's background when I first read a excerpt from the book in the NY Daily News. It sounded intriguing, but, while I am a big sports fan, gymnastics has never been my thing. I subsequently saw the book on display in Barnes & Noble and perused it. I was more intrigued but still couldn't bring myself to buy it. The next trip to the store, I caved and picked it up. Great decision. This is an astonishing story on multiple fronts. It reads almost like a novel in that many of the things that have happened in Dominique Moceanu's life seem like a work a fiction. No, all of that couldn't have really happened? But it did. Having a tormented childhood with a father and self-serving coaches who were so demanding that even winning a gold medal in the Olympics wasn't good enough. Emancipation from her parents at age 17. A second gymnastics comeback vindictively thwarted by the very same egotistical coaches whom she had helped win the team gold medal in 1996. That was just the tip of iceberg, when at age 26, about to give birth to her first child, Moceanu finds out that she has a long lost sister who was given up for adoption at birth. This sister had idolized Dominique as a young child, not knowing they were biological sisters. The sister was handicapped, born without legs, yet she's managed to accomplish more than most 'ordinary' people ever do. A fascinating read on various levels. Touching human interest story. An indictment of the overbearing nature of (some) coaching in elite level gymnastics. Inspirational example of what proper attitude can allow one to accomplish.
B007UR1OHO|1.0|This movie was super slow.  My mom, sisters, and I loaded up on gelato and kicked all the men out in preparation to watch this movie.  All of us were so disappointed that we traded two hours of chick time for this movie.  We forced ourselves to keep watching in hopes that it would get better and that the supposed determination of Tatum to win his wife back would move us to heartfelt sorrow and anticipated victory.  That didn't happen. Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams had poor chemistry.  What should have been sappy but acceptable romantic interludes were poorly done and completely unbelievable.

141690977X|5.0|I think this is one of the best dating/relationships self-help books on the market.<br /><br />Greg totally nailed it with the concept of 'He's Just Not That Into You'.<br /><br />It might sound a little harsh at first, but you need to read all the way through, perhaps even twice, to really get what he means.<br /><br />In a nutshell, he encourages women to move on from relationships that are not right for them as quickly as possible, rather than waiting around for things to magically improve, trying to change the man, or compromising (too much) what you truly need from a partner - and, as a result, ending up unhappy. The same can be applied to non-romantic relationships, such as those with family, friends and work colleagues.<br /><br />It's definitely made a difference in my life. Ladies, 'don't waste the pretty' on a man who doesn't appreciate you. Move on ASAP and find someone who does!
B008OOYALE|3.0|Dragon Story is fun but you have to spend a lot of coins to do stuff and its hard to get coins. Like when you expand your land you have to spend coins to clear the trees and stuff to be able to use the land. You also have to wait a long time for your eggs to hatch and for your dragons to evolve. They should get DragonVale in the Amazon app store too. Anyways I might delete.

B008602KQI|5.0|Some people will love it depending on whether your ok with how they leave some parts out of the book. If not then chances are you might not like it. I myself love it I watched it 3 times so far and about to watch it food the 4th. I just loved how it came together. I think its the best movie I ever saw. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|When I first read \\"The Forever Girl\\" by Rebeca Hamilton, I thought that she was a good author, and now, after reading \\"Her Sweetest Downfall\\", I must say that she is a GREAT AUTHOR, all my expectations have been fulfilled.<br /><br />I must say that this novella has taken me back to the world that Rebeca had created in The Forever Girl,though I think you do not need to have read that to understand this novella, and I have been really happy to be back there.<br /><br />In this story, the author makes you feel every feeling in the characters life, every scent, every beat of their hearts...You are under their skins from the first word in the first chapter, and in my opinion this is one of the best thing you can find in the story, she is able to take you into the story so that you cannot give it up.<br /><br />I love romance, I love fantasy, I love feeling how my nerves get crazy and relaxed when things get better. If you like feeling like me, you should read this novela. I am sure you will be hungry of more, so as I am.

0985081821|5.0|When I decided to read \\"The Forever Girl 1\\", I did not know what was about to happen around me. It got me in the first chapter when I discovered that I was IN the book.<br /><br />The author, Rebeca Hamilton, makes you feel as if you were each of the character...you are in SophíaZs skin, you listen the voices in your mind, you feel what she is feeling each moment in the story.<br /><br />Sophia finds herself in a world that compells yourself.So, itZs been an amazing adventure in which you are caught from the first word. As I said, itZs in first person,so I felt as if I were Sophia and I were living her experience at the same moment she was.<br /><br />IZm not going to talk about the plot because you can read it in the synopsis of the book, but the world that Rebecca has created will make you feel as if you were in the scene in the moment in which everything is happening. RebeccaZs describing ability is so good that you can even feel how the house is burning in front of you or feel how Charles is touching every part of your body...I love this man!!!!!! (I was always scared when they werenZt together)<br /><br />Thanks Rebecca for create this amazing story. IZm looking forward to reading Book 2, and everybody who read it will,which I hope to come to my eyes pretty soon. After reading The Forever Girl, nothing will be the same for you!!!!!

0812550706|5.0|The \\"Ender's Game\\" was a very good book full off excitement. Science fiction isn't really my favorite genre, so I did not want to read the book at first. My brother insisted I read it and I'm so happy he did. Ender is young child bread for perfection. In an over populated world now controlled by the number of children you can have, kids are freakishly intelligent and defend the universe from buggers [Aliens]. At a very young age Ender is sent off to space school. Ender is tested with many challenges, including uncalled for fiscal contact. Ender does not put up with this and fights back to protect himself. Ending up with a few casualties.<br />Ender went through some hard times and he didn't think he would make it but the generals kept saying, \\"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get to it.\\" Ender is almost pushed to extinction, only wanting to just quit. He is like a robot; I'm still wondering how Ender did it all. Although Ender wants to quit he still goes on, only for his beloved sister. While ender is out fighting, his brother and sister make use off their self in politics. Ender is quickly moved to the highest school even though his trainer is unhappy by this. He ends up saying \\"All right. We're saving the world, after all. Take him.\\" If not for this the world would be no more, the buggers would have destroyed it. In Ender's new school things are different he is pushed even harder but as they said \\"He's the one.\\" This was very accurate, not wrong at all. His scores where unbelievable, no one could compare to them. Even though everyone in the book is bigger and better ender always come out on top.<br />I have no clue how Ender does it he is amazing I'd like to say smarter than Napoleon or any other great warrior. This book was great 5 stars all the way. I really wish they would come out with another book. This book is a have to read for any age. If you don't read it you're missing out, on one off the best books ever. I only wish that the book would have been a lot longer a little too short. Orson Scott Card did a great job by far one off his best books, if not the best book he has ever had. At the beginning off the book Orson Scott Card talked about how he got the ideas which I found quite amazing. If you ask me this book is way better than the \\"Hunger Games\\" or any other war book. Yet it does not have a lot of fancy awards. \\"Ender's Game\\" is a great must read thriller. Great for any age.
B005WGBQ9G|4.0|I have never read the comic books this series was based on, so I cannot compare the two, but being a fan of all things zombie, I was very impressed with \\"The Walking Dead.\\"<br /><br />The major strength of this television format is that it allows rich character development without the brevity and time constraints of a two hour movie. We get to know each person, their strengths and weaknesses, hopes and fears. Thus, we grow to care for these characters (some more than others), and this human drama, more so than the zombies themselves, was what kept me coming back for more.<br /><br />The first season did a masterful job of keeping us emotionally invested in the story. While I still liked season 2, I personally found the middle episodes losing momentum. There is only so much you can do plot wise with being stuck on an isolated farm, and some of the character conflicts and zombie scenarios grew tiresome. By the time the umpteenth character wandered off by themselves into the forest or into town, I started to get exasperated as I knew they would soon encounter a zombie and struggle to get away.<br /><br />But the series redeemed itself with the tense final episode of season 2, as all hell breaks loose, the surviving group struggle to stay alive, and a radical plot development is revealed. Can't wait for season 3.
B004ASNG04|4.0|Although I am rather skeptical about the whole idea of measuring such a complex concept as society's development and assigning specific marks to it, still I must admit that there is a method in this \\"folly.\\" the author is undoubtedly well documented, not only in archaeology, but in history as well. This book updated my notions on ancient civilizations (I used to think that the earliest times we knew anything about went little further back than 5000 bC, while the author brought convincing information on events dating back to 15000 bC).<br />Another merit of this book is that of actually measuring how dark the Dark Ages really were and to what extent medieval times represented a decline versus e.g. the Roman Empire, by comparing and relating significant data, such as maritime traffic, etc.<br /><br />In short, I rate this book with 4 stars because, though I find the graphs purposeful, the author seems to me almost to fall in love with his figures and make the whole excercise look somewhat gimmicky.
0061537969|5.0|I'm not a dog person.  In fact, I tend to not like dogs, since my experiences with them have mostly involved them harassing me while running and cycling.  But I LOVED this incredible book!<br /><br />This is a deeply moving story involving a diverse cast of characters which seem very real and believable.  I personally identified strongly with the lead character (not the dog) because of some things I've been through in my life (including driving in the rain on a track), and I've encountered the other characters in my life too.  And the plot was powerful and gripping, fully holding my attention from start to finish.  There are some truly sad moments, even heartbreaking - part of the reason I said the story is deeply moving - but many other dimensions of the human condition and experience are represented as well.  Frankly, I was spent by the end, but in a worthwhile way, maybe on the order of some sort of catharsis.<br /><br />Really, this is an incredible story, one of the best works of fiction I've ever encountered - and I'm mainly a non-fiction guy.  I don't know how the author, Garth Stein, was able to conceive and execute this story so well.  But I'm grateful, and will be reading (actually, listening to the excellent unabridged audiobook) again.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|I have a decent knife collection which includes the CS SKR in San Mai III steel as well as a Fallkniven S1. The SRK is very very good. Extremely sharp out of the box. Nice heft, nice grip and nice sheath. Thick blade which makes the knife very sturdy. Did not have to resharpen it yet so can't talk about that. This blade (VG1) comes from Japan as does the one on the S1 (VG10). I really can't tell any difference although VG10 is 'supposed' to be somewhat better. The blade on the SRK is a little longer than the S1 but the S1 has a longer overall length. If you are on a budget get the CS and save yourself about $50 over the S1.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Just thinking about writing a review for this book makes me tired. So, I'm not gonna spend a lot of time and energy on one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is so contrived that it was painful to follow.There is nothing good to say about the characters. Not a one was believable. In fact, nothing is believable about this book. I can't understand how it got published! For those of you tempted to buy it, remember that &#34;best seller&#34; does not necessarily reflect the quality of the book, but reflects the quantity of fools that bought it. Thank goodness Kindle lets you try it before you buy it. I'd give this so-called novel zero stars if I could!
B0014I4KIK|3.0|We bought this album after hearing a couple of the songs on the car radio and enjoying them.  On the home stereo, her voice sounds quite nasal, and the backup band sounds pretty uninspired.  As to the songs, the sound is retro, the drumming is particularly boring, and everything begins to sound pretty much the same.  This is OK as background music, but certainly nothing that we feel like turning up and getting into.  On the other hand, lots of people seem to like it, so suggest you listen to the samples through headphones, and decide whether it's music you'll enjoy over your home stereo.....

I LOVE the cd I have, but why should I buy it again??!!  I wish they would just cut a second cd.  Totally not fair!!!!!  Ellie has a beautiful voice and I have been looking for her next release.  A re-release of an old one is just not fair to fans!!!  Nothing against her, many artists do this, and it's wrong!!  But \\"Lights\\" is fabulous--not one bad song.  She is so talented!  So I would guess this one is even better.

B008MBXFEM|4.0|My favorite of the Nolan Trilogy. However there was one key track I wish it had, that is stopping me from giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />This is the track that plays at the final showdown starting with when the police are facing off againsts Bane's mercs. It starts with the Deshi Basara chant (slowly) when Mathew Modine's character says \\"there is only one police in this town\\". The soundtrack should have included that part in the \\"Imagine the Fire\\" track. If anyone somehow finds this track, please let me know. When this movie comes out in dvd, I'm gonna see if I can find a way to rip that track from it

B008602KQI|3.0|I am not a very good person for writing reviews but I thought I would just warn people about this movie.<br /><br />I have seen the movie and read the first and second books so Im not just throwing things out of my ass. Personally 15 dollars for this movie is way too expensive. I tormented an HD quality rip of this movie three days before release. Not sure how they do that but yeah way better than Amazon's streaming.<br /><br />Now it may depend on whether or not you read the book before the movie. I did while on a rainy cruise being stuck inside. The book is only about 380 to 400 pages so it's not hard hard to put everything in the movie. I mean the the 7th Happy Potter book was 780 or so pages and the movie(s) were very accurate to the book.<br /><br />The movie misses some important parts in the book. I will list some here in this review so be aware of the SPOILER ALERTS. These do go tell some things of the second book.<br /><br />1. *SPOILER ALERT*<br />In the movie Katniss is given a pin with a Mockingjay on it. She then sneaks the pin into the games. But really what happens in the book is that she is given the pin by District 12's Mayor's daughter. Each tribute is allowed a symbol such as the pin so it's not like she had to sneak it into the games. The reason this upsets me is because in the 2nd book because the daughter gives Katniss the pin they become friends after she survives the games. Katniss is sometimes invited over to the daughters house ( I cant remember the daughter's name at the moment.) for dinner or for the two of them to talk. In the 2nd book katniss over hears a television in the Mayor's office and it shows the riots and the people rebelling in District 8. The movie just shows a scene of people knocking people over and raiding stuff after Rue dies. This does play a big part in the books but they probably will fix that in the second with all this money from the first movie.<br /><br />2nd. *SPOILER ALERT*<br />When katniss is taken into the visiting room after being selected at the Reaping Gal is allowed in to talk. In the book after they tell Gal to leave he starts to say something to Katniss but by then the door is closed and she cant hear what he said. Later in the second book you realize what he was going to tell her was that he loved her. In the movie they don't mention any of that. The love between Katniss and Gal starts them to start wondering whether or not to leave the district. I find this as a big part of the books and should be included in the movie/movies.<br /><br />That's probably not everything that upset me but like I said I don't do reviews that often. This is just my opinion so sorry if I have said some incorrect content of the book or movie so please feel free to correct that or my grammar(if it means that much to you) in the comments. Thanks for reading.<br />- You can call me Rob.
0385534639|5.0|If you want a quick, easy beach read go elsewhere. This book is as intriguing as it puzzling. It hooks you because the reader really doesn't know where it is going next. I loved it.

B008602KQI|4.0|(this review contains no spoilers)<br /><br />Gary Ross's adaptation of THE HUNGER GAMES is pretty faithful -- in fact, it's probably one of the most faithful book-to-movie adaptations I've ever seen. I remember reading the first book in the series and constantly thinking \\"oh man, this would make a great movie.\\" And it's true: the movie version of THE HUNGER GAMES is good. However, most of the movie will seem very, very familiar to those that have already read the books. With original author Suzanne Collins cowriting the screenplay, many of the points in the movie are line-for-line translations to film.<br /><br />Here's some plot information for those that have not read the books: in the future, America has been segregated into 12 districts, and every year, two young adults are selected from each district (one male, one female). Those that are selected are entered into a competition called \\"The Hunger Games;\\" it's a competition where the winner is the last male or female left standing. In a dangerous environment with little food and plenty of weapons/traps, the main character, Katniss Everdeen, has to find a way to survive and make it back home.<br /><br />While I was skeptical of the cast, all of them turn in great performances. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic in Winter's Bone, not so great in X-Men: First Class, but she really inhabits the role of Katniss Everdeen well. Elizabeth Banks isn't even recognizable while playing Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman is an absolute blast. And on and on -- the cast is great.<br /><br />Gary Ross's direction is remarkably clear. I was pleasantly surprised by the dystopian aesthetic that the crew was able to achieve early in the movie. Once the characters find themselves in the Hunger Games, the setting is so wildly different -- and the same goes for the Capital. These settings never look cheap or uninspired: they are all different and relatively detailed. Some of the dialog doesn't quite translate well to the screen -- where characters spouting off exposition in the book feels natural, it comes off as a bit stilted here. The romance element doesn't really manifest itself all that well here either. One of the unfortunate things about this adaptation is how rigidly it adheres to its PG rating. The book is a bloody mess at times, and the movie is pretty sterile in comparison. While I understand that the studio essentially forced the movie to meet a PG-rating so that children would be able to to see it, the move really tones things down. A certain character's death isn't nearly as poignant because viewers aren't able to see everything that happens. Haymitch, a slobbering drunkard in the book, has a few drinks here, but isn't depicted nearly as disorderly as he does in the books.<br /><br />If you've read the books, your enjoyment of this movie will come from what you want from it: if you want a literal adaptation of the book, you are in for a treat because this movie never strays from the book. If, however, you would prefer the movie add something to the series that couldn't have been done in the books, you won't find much of it here. Overall, it's a pretty good movie, but the PG-rating removes some of the book's teeth.screen -- where characters spouting off exposition in the book feels natural, it comes off as a bit stilted here.

B0006B2A42|4.0|1968's \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is a dramatization of the Alistair Maclean novel of the same name.  Its premise is the launching of an American nuclear attack submarine under the Arctic ice cap, loaded with Marines and two spies, one British, the other Russian.  Their objective is to rescue the crew of a drift ice science station, which has been damaged by fire.  In reality, they hope to retrieve a film capsule dropped from a satellite near Ice Station Zebra before the Soviets can get it.<br /><br />The cast was headlined by a number of prominent actors, including Rock Hudson as the commander of the USS TIGERFISH, Jim Brown as the leader of the Marines, Patrick McGoohan as a British intelligence officer, and Earnest Borgnine as a Russian spy who has defected to the West.  The plot is rather convoluted and involves multiple betrayals and a dramatic confrontation with the Soviets on the ice.  The ending is perhaps unexpected.  The cinematography and special effects have held up pretty well.<br /><br />\\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is still a decent action thriller of the Cold War genre, although it is not as good as MacLean's original novel, which featured a tense but coherent plot, an heroic American submarine crew, and a cunning but differently motivated hero.  Alistair Maclean fans are recommended to stick to the original; for all others, the movie is certainly worth a look.
B007M45PMU|4.0|While modern music has been moving towards a more synthesized, polished brand of sound, there has been an increase in bands that focus on traditional, folksy songwriting.  Compared to, let's say Maroon 5, these bands stick out in stark contrast.  Fleet Foxes, Arcade Fire, Mumford & Sons, Admiral Fallows, the Head and the Heart, Old Crow Medicine Show, the Avett Brothers -- the list goes on and on.  The Lumineers' debut album (selftitled) firmly establishes the band as a group to be reckoned with in these ranks.<br /><br />The band begins with the poignant \\"Flowers in Your Hair,\\" and it's a great introduction to the band's sound and sensibilities.  The Lumineers aren't quite folk, not quite bluegrass, not quite Americana, not quite blues, but they fall somewhere along all of these spectrums.  Underlining everything is Wesley Schultz's earnest vocal delivery and Neyla Pekarek's fantastic harmonies.  \\"Ho Hey\\" is the song that everyone has been talking about lately -- the band's breakthrough hit is representative of a lot of the material on this album.  The album ranges between faster songs and slower ballads, and the band handles both equally well (I don't seem to really prefer one style over the other here).<br /><br />The Lumineers have established themselves as a band on the rise and certainly one to watch in the next few years.  Listeners of Mumford & Sons, Old Crow Medicine Show, and the Head and the Heart will find plenty of material here to love.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B007FNN9BW Ho Hey]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B007M45QWO Slow It Down]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B007M45RNM Morning Song]].\\"

B007IXWL2C|5.0|A lot of people have touched on this and I would like to defend the author for doing this; repeating the phrases and words both characters use: \\"Mr. Grey, Mrs. Grey \\" seems to be a particularly big issue with everyone. When we read the first book it was something Grey did that Ana picked up. It continued into the second book and then the third book because it is who they are, quirky and eclectic. If the author had changed some of the more frequent things they do or say, then we would lose who the characters really are by book two. If you ever take a literary class in school,  you will hear the word \\"repitition\\" throughout the entire course. It is a way to keep the audience in the loop throughout the story; it keeps everything fresh in your mind so you don't have to go flipping through pages to see if it was something already said or done and where. Yes there were some parts in the book where the word made absolutely no sense but as an avid reader and learner, I loved that they were new words I had never heard of before and that (after looking up the definition) they have now been added to my vocabulary. These types of books are meant to entertain,  not for you to completely over analyze like Ana. Please, just sit down and read. If you don't like it then don't read it but I love the books. I read a new book every day and I read this book quickly because I could not put it down,  which is a new for me. Great job E. L. James.
0738711500|2.0|My Mom wanted a Tarot deck.  We browsed the shelves then I pointed out a design that I love and use, Ciro Marchetti's The Gilded Tarot  [[ASIN:0738705209 The Gilded Tarot (Book and Tarot Deck Set)]]-with the same designs as the set pictured here.  So she picked this deck, the \\"Easy Tarot.\\"<br /><br />I assumed it was authored by the same reader as mine, Barbara Moore.  It is not.  Together my Mom and I did her first spread and compared book interpretations.  We agreed we did not like the author's interpretations in the book provided with this set - the \\"Easy Tarot,\\" and instead preferred the readings provided in my set with book of interpretations provided by Barbara Moore.  In fact we felt very disappointed and not at all in agreement with this book's interpretations, in our opinion, sometimes too vague, and even off-base.  I hope my Mom will still use her deck, but the book provided in \\"Easy Tarot\\"  will be a deterrent, I am sure.

B005LAIHPY|3.0|There are some movies that just want to entertain you. This is one of them. It has no geopolitical pretenses, no higher motives, no highfalutin' ambitions. It's fun, it's got great CGI, and yet there's moments that are genuinely striking, particularly in the relationship between the layabout leading man and the Japanese captain who helps him after the fecal matter hits the circulating air device. As a matter of fact, I found that relationship kind of touching, given the respectful way the Japanese were treated throughout the film, as allies.  I also liked that the crew reflected something of Hawaii's racial mix in its population, and that the sarcastic cameraderie of the military was captured in much of its scatalogical glory. And most wonderful of all was the performance of an actual Army vet in a major, unforgettable role as the amputee who needed something to fight for after a lifetime of service.<br /><br />  I have to say the weakest link was a froth-spitting Alexander Skaarsgaard,  whose entire performance in this movie seemed to consist of humorless pill or goggle eyed cannon fodder, but that's the way I've found him in so many other things. I'm biased in favor of his father, and with good reason.<br /><br /> The movie starts out with an absolutely hysterical exercise in comic excess, as Hopper, the lead character, tries to impress a pretty girl in a bar. You'll never look at another chicken burrito again, and Taylor Kitsch shamelessly milks the comedy from every last second of it. What's surprising is that she's the daughter of an Admiral, and she's very much the love interest, but not in the family business. It's the one kind of disappointing decision in the movie, especially seeing as how the actress gamely makes as much of the role as she can, given that there's not much there. (Having Rihanna around, nailing her lines with attitude and relish doesn't help her, either.) Speaking of Rihanna, she's both bad ass and funny consistently the way through, whether saying, \\"Maholo, (word that refers via obscenity to Oedipus' improper relationship with his mother)\\", or spanking a Japanese rival in soccer on the bootie and saying, \\"C'mon, princess.\\"<br /><br />  The heroism of the lead character isn't black and white or anything, either: it's flawed and stubborn and based on bad decisions, but he listens to wiser voices, whatever their rank, and manages to save lives and eventually redeem himself, in some rather touching scenes. (Even if, as I am, an Army vet and not a Navy one.) The chemistry between the characters enlivens almost all of the dialogue and interaction, and while most of the actors were relative unknowns,(at least to me and with the exception of Neeson and Rihanna) they commanded the screen and gave the movie a richness of personality you just wouldn't expect. The name actors----Skarsgaard and Neeson-----were outplayed by the many small roles filled with actors who made the very most of their short time on the screens. It was a delightful surprise.<br /><br />  There's some surprising emotional heft to the movie due to the absolute rightness of some of the way the director \\"got\\" the way soldiers, sailors, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard will nag and fight among themselves and then practically kill themselves to save a fellow the very next minute if one of their brethren come under fire.<br /><br />  Now on to the bad: the plot, and....the plot. Yeah,  this is just a big dumb action movie, but it never pretended to be anything but, and yet its actors gave it their all, and that's why I'd watch a sequel unquestioningly if the same personnel were involved.<br /><br />  All in all, great fun.r saying, \\"Maholo, (word that refers via obscenity to Oedipus' improper relationship with his mother)\\", or spanking a Japanese rival in soccer on the bootie and saying, \\"C'mon, princess.\\"<br /><br />  The heroism of the lead character isn't black and white or anything, either: it's flawed and stubborn and based on bad decisions, but he listens to wiser voices, whatever their rank, and manages to save lives and eventually redeem himself, in some rather touching scenes.

0545123283|5.0|Linger is the second in Stiefvater's Wolves of Mercy Falls.  It picks up where Shiver left off, only this time Stiefvater included two new narrators: Isabelle and new wolf, Cole.  I have to say I really enjoyed the new additions.  I was prepared not to like Cole - I generally don't get along with jerky guys.  But Cole had a lot more depth than I expected and ended up being a really fun character.  I also enjoyed Isabelle's point of view.  She is definitely working out some grief issues and is not afraid to call people out on their crap.  Love that.<br /><br />I also enjoyed following Sam and Grace's continuing romance.  There is much less of a hurried feeling now that Sam is remaining human during the winter.  But there sense of foreboding as Sam can't quite let himself believe that everything will remain ok (and he's right about that).<br /><br />Where Shiver was like a time bomb counting down, Linger is slow and simmering.  Stiefvater is a great writer and has a knack for setting the mood through her words.  Linger has a melancholy feel with a touch of foreboding.  And of course, it ends with a cliffhanger like Shiver did.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Shiver, you will like Linger.  I can't wait to read the final installment, Forever!

B003AMAOW4|5.0|Wagner's Lohengrin is perhaps his most overtly 'romantic' opera. Indeed, it is the quintessential 'knight in shining armor/damsel in distress' story. But like its other Wagnerian cousins (and direct relative, Parsifal) there are many layers of meaning at work in Wagner's text. Musically, this is his most brilliantly scored work, full of brassy fanfares and rousing choruses.<br /><br />And in every way, this is an outstanding musical performance. The American born and trained Kent Nagano, Director of the Bavarian State Opera, leads a performance that can stand comparison to any recording I have heard. His cast, many of them home grown favorites, is headed by THE great singer of our time, Jonas Kaufmann, whose voice, technique and temperment are ideally suited to the role of the Swan Knight.<br />Only one tentative attack on a pianissimo high note slightly mars an otherwise unimpeachable live performance, introspective, anguished, and heroic by turns.<br /><br />Anja Harteros, a German-Greek soprano whose star has been rising in recent years, plays Elsa as a visionary at odds with her regimented surroundings. She is fully immersed in the role and perfectly suited to the vocals demands, as well. Wolfgang Koch and Michaela Schuster are well matched as a thuggish Telramund and his blond gun-moll Ortrud. Friedrich is a notoriously ungrateful role, easily descending into stock moustache-twirling villainy and cruelly high in the voice. Koch is more than up to the vocal demands, and is wholly credible as the villain who is also a victim. Schuster, as his wife, is all eye-popping, sneering, malice. If she does not erupt with quite the volcanic force of Christa Ludwig, well, who else does?<br /><br />Christoff Fischesser, one of a bumper crop of young German basses, may seem a bit callow as the warrior-king Henry the Fowler (the one historic figure in the opera, father of the founfer of the Holy Roman Empire), but he sings Heinrich's demanding part with finesse and detail. TheKing's Herald, here a significant presence in acts one and two, is excellently proclaimed by Evgeny Nikitin<br /><br />The Bavarian State Opera Chorus is the equal of any, i.e. The Met or Vienna, opera chorus in the world, as is the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra.<br /><br />As to the production: To those \\"all-rude dank word-sayers\\" who decry anything resembling a modernized staging I say \\"Shut your mouth and open your mind!\\" I know every bar of this opera well, I own scores, both full orchestral and piano reduction, and I speak German fluently. I am also both a trained opera singer and trained in theater production. And I am telling you all that this is one of the most intelligent, well-thought-out modernized productions I have ever seen. Not a single detail is not clearly without meaning in the context the director, Richard Jones, has devised. Yes, perhaps we miss Lohengrin's entrance in gleaming armor. But if we understand him as man living a preternatural life, desperate to find his way to a normal world and fit in, then his appearance in a baggy t-shirt makes perfect sense. If he is not drawn onstage by the swan, he is at least carrying it, and this becomes an allusion to his father, Parsifal's slaying of a swan as an ignorant youth. The building of the house is a metaphor for the building of a Society, and when Lohengrin is betrayed he burns that house, leaving the town a series cots, like a homeless shelter.<br /><br />All aspects of Ultz's designs are similarly integrated: The Brabantian (Bavarian?) costumes gold uniforms yielding to Lohengrin's blue t-shirts; the wedding ceremony  mingling blue and gold sand in a vase; the Herald `broadcasting' from a tall chair to TV screens; even the quote from Wagner (Here, where my delusions find peace, I name Wahnfried, my home) integrate into a thoughtful gloss on Wagners score. To dismiss all regie-theater out of hand is as reactionary and luddite as those forgotten 19th Century critics who declared Wagner's \\"Musicof the Future\\" as an ill-fated aberration.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|To be concise; I love the series. I've read a lot of fantasy and Science Fiction series over the years. This isn't the best or most enjoyable. But I'm waiting on book 6 and 7 and will buy them. The writers imagination, and created world is genius. The Characters are enticing, interesting, and often complex. But; All Men Must Die. And that is the problem. Every character you love or hate dies. Once you get invested in them a knife, arrow, or axe finishes the relationship. Even bad guys you love to hate die quickly. As you sift through five thick volumns of books you feel a deep hopeless loss. I'm at the point of realizing I'm addicted, smoking more but enjoying it less. How is George Martin going to sew all the characters and sub-plots into a satisfying conclusion? He's not. He can't. Most of the plot problems will die or be killed off. This is not a fantasy series but a television series that will continue as long as the ratings and sales continue. We're watching a fantasy world called a Game of Thrones, not reading a novel, a story with plot, a satisfying adventure series. I believe George Martin has begun building more house than he can finish. If he pulls this off he is Genius. If not he was an opportunist. All Men Must Die.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie was an average movie for something hollywood puts out and can be entertaining if you forget about the books. The problem is that no one seems to be doing that. Much of the rich detail is lost in the adaption and the cuts are spread too thin. The viewer doesn't really get any time to focus on anything in particular of much substance. I remember when Pearl Harbor came out reviewers said that you couldn't manufacture a romance in 40 minutes and though I am not that \\"old romantic\\" type of guy I think that it was well done. Unfortunately I don't think you see that much time of Peeta and Katniss together in the entire movie. The Hunger Games is this kind of movie, designed to give you an outline for important events so that you can refresh your memory from the book in a quicker and a hollywood-style entertaining way. Much like a study guide from your school days, it outlines important events hardly ever going into detail, but when it does you appreciate it and focus on those moments as you prepare for your upcoming essay of writing a review like any passionate hunger games fan has.<br /><br />So all in all if you're a fan you sort of have to buy the movie but I won't blame you if you wait for the price to drop a little. If you're not a fan definitely see it and maybe wait for the price to drop a decent amount before you buy it (if you're the type of person who avoids movie rentals).<br /><br />Waste of Space below \/ :)<br />*Read Only if you Have lots of Energy/Excitement either in a positive or negative way about the movie, the regular review is done :) This is the movie that I wanted (in hindsight) and I was wondering if you people out there would agree so please leave feedback.*<br />Okay so I have done some thinking about this series and how this movie fits in with the novels. I have to say that when I first saw it I was extremely disappointed. I couldn't put my finger on exactly why but everything seemed wrong, until it struck me. The screen writers triedto do something pretty noble. Something that we (the fans) all wanted them to do. They tried to fit all of the elements of the book into this one movie and make it marketable (because let's face it hollywood just makes movies for us for the money) but Susan Collins wanted a work of art. Unfortunately a movie cannot contain all of the elements of the book, it is just too short. The way it went down was that they wanted to equip the viewer with all of the scenes that they would need to transition into the second book. Tension with Gale, rebellion in the districts, etc. and not so much on the story that is really the foundation of the series, it is the story that supports these grand themes and future subplots. I really think that Gale should have been cut out along with the rebellion and be labelled a side-note to be focused on later, here's why: Time is limited so two things need to be focused on, the game itself and Peeta&Katniss mushiness I suppose is an adequate description. Their \\"romance\\" was so weak because they barely spoke 5 sentences to one another before the games, compared to spending almost an entire week in each others company (in the book). At the end, all they need to show is Katniss having second thoughts about Peeta and so forth for viewers that are new to the series and leave a cliffhanger with Peeta hurt/confused and Katniss beginning to wall herself off. Then second movie, (because of course there was always going to be a sequel) you do a \\"oh yeah, remember Gale? and defying the Capital? well quelling that in your interview didn't work Katniss\\" and then introduce Gale as the cause of Katniss' unease and go from there with Snow pushing her to the limits of her sanity and forcing her to decide what she thinks about \\"the boy with the bread\\". Plug done the whole Hunger Games movie series saved. But what do you think?
1416914285|3.0|I've put off reading this series because, well, it's 6 books long!  But I finally decided to take the plunge since it is so popular.  After reading it, I had the same feeling I did after reading Twilight.  I just don't see what all the hoopla is all about. I felt like it was a series you are either on board with or you're not. Unfortunately, I fell more into the latter category.  I didn't hate it, but I wasn't blown away by it either.  I think my main problem is I felt that Clare was just trying too hard.  She just pushed the limits of the characters and plot until it just seemed a little desperate.  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me saying this, but I found Jace to be very tiresome. I know Clare was trying to make bad boy Jace funny and edgy, but it felt so forced. I wasn't as amused by Jace's quips as everyone else in the book seemed to be.  I also have a hard time getting behind romances where the guy is a total a-hole to everyone, but the girl falls in love with him anyways.  Not to say I'm against bad boys, but I need to see some kind of reason why a girl would be interested, you know? Clary was ok, but fairly uninteresting to me.  I think she has a lot of potential to develop into a pretty kick ass character, but in this book she was basically just argumentative and headstrong and constantly putting herself and others in danger.  (Another pet peeve of mine - being headstrong does not make you a \\"strong\\" character.  It makes you reckless.)<br /><br />I did like the Shadowhunter idea and all the different supernatural beings, but the plot was a little slow for me.  I felt the book was overly long and started to lose some steam at the end.  I like some of the major revelations that come up, such as Valentine's background and history.  But some of the plot took unnecessary turns, ESPECIALLY the big twist at the end. Um, WHAT?!  Ick.<br /><br />I know there are many out there who love this series and I can see the attraction, but for me it was not my favorite.  I just don't think it held my attention enough to read the rest of the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The 1,500+ reviews on this book do not lie. I read the sample and purchased the omnibus edition and could not put it down. The storyline and the writing style kept me glued to the pages until the very end. Free of errors, typos, and other silly mistakes made by most e-book authors, it was a pleasure to read - even the slow parts were enjoyable because it allowed the reader to absorb and digest the story.<br /><br />The first two stories were the best to me out of the entire series. It really set the tone for this desolate world where people live deep, deep underground and forge a new environment for themselves. Although the story is dark at times, it is ultimately a story of hope, faith, and love - hope of a better tomorrow, faith in humanity, and love between human beings (romantic, platonic, familial) that seek to conquer the tragedy that is sometimes our existence.<br /><br />The heroine faces the difficulty of being cast out of society and fighting against the authority that tries to protect the community by plying it with subterfuge and misinformation. In the end, she would rather share the truth about the world with the citizens of the silo rather than continue the status quo, even if it means the end of the false peace everyone knows. Is this the best course of action? Hard to say, but it is certainly courageous.<br /><br />Books like this make me appreciate self-publishing, although I think Wool would have found a publisher even in a traditional publishing world. Buy it! It is worth so much more than those other generic, formulaic books that authors and publishers charge far more for. It will not disappoint.

B00457WZEI|5.0|I am so grateful that I read this book. It was so well written and captured what warhorses must have seen and felt. Many people think animals do not have feelings, I am not one of them. I have six dogs and a parrot and I know they have feelings. Just look into their eyes and see their soul. This book allows you to look into the soul of a magnificant horse and the events he went through as not only a horse but as a victim of war. The movie was terrific but the book is so much more. Don't miss the opportunity to go on this journey. You will not regret having read this book.
034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers falls into a genre I like to call \\"Book Club Lit\\".  It's that type of book that usually stars a broken young woman with a tragic past who has to has to learn to trust and forgive again, usually with the help of some special or quirky characters.  The Language of Flowers most definitely falls into that category, but I found it better than most in that genre.  It is a sad, yet hopeful book.  It begins on Victoria's 18th birthday as she is released from the foster system.  After spending all her life in the foster system, Victoria is almost feral and completely distrusts everyone.  She knows herself to be broken and unlovable.  The only time she felt loved was when was almost adopted by Elizabeth, who taught her the language of flowers (the Victorian notion that each flower conveys a meaning).  But she was taken away from Elizabeth at the age of 11 and put back into the foster system.  The reader finds out the details in the flashbacks interspersed between the present day.<br /><br />Victoria is an extremely damaged girl and her actions are not always rational.  Sometimes she is a hard protagonist to love and makes decisions that can infuriate the reader.  Victoria does start to heal, but in small doses, with a lot of set backs.  Ultimately though, she is seeking her own redemption and forgiveness and once she begins on that path she can start to accept the love of those around her.  Victoria's journey is messy and nothing is tied up with a pretty string, but you find yourself rooting for her the entire way.<br /><br />Language of Flowers is beautifully written - very lyrical and moody.  The beginning is amazing and really draws the reader in.  The middle tends to sag a bit, but it bolstered by the ending. I found this book to be a wonderful read overall.  And yes, it would be great for book clubs. Fans of books like Sarah's Key, Broken for You, or Water for Elephants should be all over this one.

0439023491|4.0|Katniss and Peeta are at it again; they continue to have to pretend to be in love; are they really just pretending?  If you read Book 1 of this three book series, you already know which of the two is not pretending.  But what about the third person, Gale, in this love triangle?  Who is really in love with whom?  Just like The Hunger Games, Catching Fire is a slow starter - although it includes a shocker early on - but it picks up speed fast and will hold your interest.<br /><br />The ending in the Hunger Games that left those who read it wanting more, picks up immediately in Catching Fire.  At first, the setting of this Game, which is a Quarter Quell, might seem to be too limited to accommodate an exciting and audience-riviting Game.  Read on, you will be surprised!<br /><br />Just like it starts with a shocker, Catching Fire ends with a shocker.

0393340244|5.0|Cordelia Fine has done science a great service with \\"Delusions of Gender.\\"  Fine, a neurophilosopher of note, seeks to attack the now-prodigious belief that neuroscience has established the existence of \\"hard-wired\\" differences between the cognition of men and women.  In modern journalism and educational theory, it has become increasingly trendy to claim that neurological sex differences can explain anything from differing color preferences, to career choice, and even the gender gap in mathematics.  Some modern education theorists even claim that modern neurology supports the idea that education should be strictly sexually segregated in order to account for the supposed innate qualitative differences in learning ability between sexes(girls are supposedly inherently emphatic, while boys are supposedly inherently systemic).  These ideas are so casually cited as facts in the media that many people, in my experience at least, tend to have the impression that they represent the consensus of neuroscience.  Fine has three main objections to this popular trend:<br />1.  Neuroscientists have not, in fact, discovered real evidence of innately \\"hardwired\\" differences in the \\"knowledges\\" of males and females.<br />2. These pop writers misinterpret neuroscience in general.  The media has crafted a picture of neuroscience which portrays it as the search for innate human nature, which goes against the essence of the field, and creates the false impression that we should ignore data from the social sciences which points to the flexibility of gender roles.<br />3. Pop neuro-sexism has potentially negative effects, and already plays a role in discouraging women from attainment in mathematical fields, the corporate world, and other areas of life.  Unfortunately, pop neuro-sexism has begun to play the same social role as past biologically-based explanations of gender divides, in that it unthinkingly treats the fleeting present of society as the permanent state of nature.<br />As Fine stresses to the reader though, \\"Delusions of Gender\\" is not meant to refute the possibility that there may be some differences between the general neurological dispositions of men and women.  Rather, her goal is to demonstrate that there is overwhelming evidence that most of the gender gap is socially constructed, and that the notion that there are \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" brains is patently absurd.<br /><br />The book is broken up into three main sections.  The first collects the massive amount of sociological and psychological data which suggests that the much-discussed \\"math\\" gap and the gap in high-level economic attainment is socially constructed.  There have been multiple and oft-repeated studies which prove that women internalize the negative effects of sexism, which have nothing to do with their innate abilities.  When women are reminded of society's opinion on female analytic ability or business acumen, they tend to do very poorly on tests which measure these abilities.  However, when women are encouraged to believe that their gender shouldn't matter, or that women are actually good at traditionally \\"masculine\\" fields of knowledge, they far outperform the average female test-taker, even to the point where they nearly close the gender gap.  This poses a serious challenge to people who carelessly speculate that gender gaps can be explained by neurological difference: Even if there were different innate tendencies between men and women, what makes them so sure that our society has fully unleashed the analytical potential of the female half of the human race?  It's an assumption that I myself find frustrating, and it is somewhat confusing as to why neuro-sexists aren't called out on it more often in the media.<br /><br />Fine also points out that the real world itself flies in the face of our patriarchal assumptions.  If our gender gaps are so innate, then why have some countries entirely closed gaps in political representation and mathematical attainment?  In fact,there are some countries where girls outperform boys on math tests.  Even more interesting, high-ranking teams in the international math Olympics have an upward trend in female representation, to the point where many of the most successful teams are now gender egalitarian.  Today, half of all new Bachelor's degrees in mathematical fields are held by women.  Recently, Master's degree representation passed the 1/3 mark, and PhD representation continues to grow at a rapid rate.  Despite this, some male mathematicians still have the gall to claim that the Bachelors-Masters-PhD discrepancies represent an innate inferiority in mathematics, thereby arbitrarily throwing down yet another so-called \\"natural\\" barrier to women's attainment.<br /><br />The second section delves into neurological evidence, and a critique of the way in which neuroscience is used by neuro-sexists.  Fine explains the history of pop neuro-sexism, and describes the research claims of the handful of neurologists it has arbitrarily selected as its stars.  Fine respectfully disagrees with the actual neuroscientists in question, but blatantly takes glee in eviscerating the claims made in pop non-fiction books such as \\"Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus.\\"  She goes through a wide variety of commonly-cited pieces of evidence for neuro-sexism.  These include the in-utero testosterone spike in males, the emphatic tendencies of women, the supposed spatial superiority of \\"male\\" brains, and other such examples.  She presents many pieces of contrary evidence to the notion that these differences have the effects that the neuro-sexists claim they do, and explains why the ultimate effects of these phenomena on developing brains are still highly ambiguous.  Perhaps most importantly, she accuses pop neuro-sexists of having an entirely incorrect understanding of the brain.  Pop authors claim that brains have \\"emphatic\\" capacities and \\"systemic\\" capacities, and that the male-ness or female-ness of your brain determines which you have.  However, in doing this, they ignore the intricate interconnectivity of these capacities, and the ways in which they strengthen one another.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that just because a person tends to use one or the other does not even suggest a weakness in the other.  The human brain can be called upon to deploy both empathy and analytic ability.  It rarely ever shelves either of them, and can quickly shift in emphasis based on the situation at hand.  Also worthy of mentioning is that new evidence points to the possibility that having an emphatic emphasis may not cripple your scientific or mathematical ability at all, and even plays an essential role in genius-level systemic thought.<br /><br />Fine admits that there is some convincing evidence that there are some types of developmental differences which affect brain structure, such as the huge gap in rates of autism which exist between the sexes.  However, when looked at from a broad perspective, neurology suggests nothing resembling a gendered division of labor.  If anything, neurology suggests that the individual is the most important unit.  Traits which are present and variant within the individual cross the gender line.  Our socialization powerfully impacts our very neurological structure, and an individual is capable of rapidly shifting their neurological activity.  Pretending that sex discrimination is somehow respectful of the supposedly unique ways that \\"female brains think\\" is absurd, not to mention socially useless.<br /><br />The final section focuses on child development, and serves mainly as an objection to the common belief that childhood behavior represents raw, unmolded human nature.  Gendered socialization begins as soon as a baby is out of the womb, and as one study indicates, possibly even in-utero.  Even the most progressive parents treat their children differently in ways that they do not consciously recognize.  Sexism makes its way into parenting by the unconscious, yet pernicious use of different word choices and tones of voice, depending on the sex of the baby.  On top of this, childhood development research has proven that although it's nearly impossible to shake adherence to gender roles once they've been adopted, that there is a surprising degree of plasticity which can change depending on the attitudes of nearby adults and even the local culture of other children.  The point being, that socialization runs agonizingly deep, and the tendency of girls to wear pink (which is a very recent phenomenon) and for boys to associate child-rearing with being \\"sissy\\" (also more historical in nature than people tend to think) are by no means self-evidently natural.<br /><br />\\"Delusions of Gender\\" is a fresh and welcome rejoinder to the nonsense on stilts which presents itself as scientific objectivity.  The evidence I relayed here is barely a fraction of what Fine provides for the reader.  This book not only refutes specific points, but also provides an exciting picture of the complexities of modern neuroscience.  Fine's conversational tone makes for an excellent guide through the nitty-gritty of this burgeoning field, while also raising a strong objection to the pseudoscience which feeds off of it.  As Fine reminds the reader, despite cries of \\"political correctness\\" from pop neuro-sexists when faced with criticism, this issue has profound moral dimensions.  When people are told that they possess a biological trait that inhibits their mental abilities, it devastates their sense of ambition and confidence.  If neuro-sexists want to avoid moral criticism, then they should refrain from trying to reform our entire education system based on faulty science, or by actively trying to stem the tide of female attainment in the same exact manner as sexists have always done.  The author also suggests that neuro-sexism hurts males too, mainly through attempts by neuro-sexist education theorists to chalk up all \\"boys' problems\\" to their neurology, thus crowding out any discussion of the effects of cultural messages we as a society send boys during their development.ines which you have.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|Got to love the 'smart' look of this app! On top of that, you can mix up to 10 sounds! Some of the sounds have their own combo to them. So no need to combine thunder + wind + rain + wind to get a Thunderstorm. I recommend this one over other ones I have purchased in the past.
B00783NWB6|5.0|This film was my introduction into the \\"Underworld\\" franchise.  I've never been a fan of vampire movies, so I typically steer clear of them, but I was hungry for a 3D movie and took a chance.  I'm glad I did because I loved it! It's not a slow, horror movie, and it doesn't involve the usual vampire cliches like driving a stake through the heart or using garlic or crosses to ward them off.  There's plenty of gunfire, crashes, explosions and gorey deaths to satisfy the action fan.  The 3D experience is great because the movie was filmed with 3D cameras, so there's lots of depth and pop-out effects.  However, at times it was a bit difficult to appreciate the 3D effects because most of the scenes were dark to begin with, and I found myself adjusting the brightness more than once to compensate for the added level of darkness caused by the glasses.  Still, the 3D effects were much more enjoyable than in many other so-called 3D movies, especially those poorly done 2D-to-3D conversions like \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and its sequel.<br /><br />After watching \\"Awakening,\\" I had to buy the first 3 chapters in the story because I was so impressed with this one.  The earlier films focus a bit more on story and the history of the feud between the vampires and lycans.  It helps if you've seen those movies, but I don't think it's mandatory if you're in it just for the effects and butt-kicking action.  The movie opens with a short montage of clips as Selene explains what came before, then she talks about how a war to eradicate the vamps and werewolves began after humans discovered their existence.  Highly recommended.

I guess I liked the comradeship, but as a not quite twenty year old anymore, I find Ross's perpetual whining annoying, and Rachel is so self-absorbed most of the time it is also . . . annoying. Some good laughs overall, but not as good as other sitcoms.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|This film was my introduction to the \\"Resdient Evil\\" franchise.  I've always avoided zombies movies, but I was looking to add another 3D movie to my collection, so I took a chance.  Though the story was about as brainless as the poor souls infected with the T virus, the action and gore were good (if not over the top), and the 3D effects were among the best I've ever seen.  In fact, I had a better 3D experience with this film than I did with \\"Avatar\\" because \\"Avatar\\" didn't have enough pop-out effects for my taste.  \\"Afterlife\\" was filled with them and also offered plenty of depth.  I got the first 3 flicks in this franchise after seeing this one just to satisfy my curiosity, but I didn't have as much fun watching them simply because they were all 2D movies.  (I'm glad I found used copies of them for dirt-cheap prices.) If the 3D in this film weren't so good, I'd knock off a star.  I'd say buy this just for the 3D if that's your main interest in it.  Otherwise, you should know the story here isn't very deep, and the action features that \\"Matrix\\" style type of wire work with lots of green screen shots (some of which work, and some of which don't).
B0084PB97G|5.0|Anyone who loves real R&B (not the spineless version of today's so-called R&B)  will be inspired by this Bobby Womack comeback album.  It's his first in many years.  Pulled out of self-imposed retirement and perhaps a bit of self-doubt and fear that he might not have anything left to offer, Bobby delivers the goods here.  And it all sounds fresh, with modern but loving production led by Daman Albarn, this joint just gives you hope.  From the opening Bravest Man cut where he beseeches both old and new young soul searchers  to \\"gather round,\\" to the heartbreaking, ethereal spell of \\"Whatever Happened to the Times\\" to the oughta-be-a-hit-single sermon of \\"Stupid,\\" Bobby grabs you with that high tenor that just takes you to church.  Amen, brother.

031620157X|3.0|First I must say that I did enjoy this book. It is a wonderful, fantastical story involving many colorful fairy tale characters living all in one world after their \\"Happily Ever After\\"s. BUT, it was definitely too young of a read for me. I do understand that a 23 year old man is not the target audience, though.<br /><br />I can see how Chris Colfer has been working on this since he was young. The world has depth, with many of the kingdoms ruled by a traditional fairy tale princess. Reading this book reminded me of so many books, as well as other media from my childhood. The twins, Alex and Connor, as well as their storybook reminded me of the kids from The Magic Tree House series. Harry Potter also came to mind, although this book isn't as well structured. Warriors of Virtue and other fantasy 90's children's films where kids are thrust into magical worlds also came to mind. Something from my early childhood that this book reminded me of was the Wee Sing VHS tapes. One of my favorite computer game series as a child was King's Quest.  Many nursery rhyme and fairy tale characters are in both of these. This book especially reminded me of King's Quest because of the list of items they needed to collect to complete the Wishing Spell. On that same note, there is a game called Enchanted Forest that has a similar theme of collecting storybook characters' items. Since Chris Colfer is around my age, I wonder if any of these things actually did inspire him.<br /><br />This book is a very easy read. Many of the big revelations were very predictable. I thought everything in the story was too easy for the twins. I wish there would have been more difficult hardships and conflicts to conquer. At some points the story was unusually dark. There were some deaths in which no repercussions were mentioned. I wanted to see more of the wolves' stories. They were seen as merely bad guys. I wanted more depth. Red Riding Hood's Kingdom is surrounded by a wall discriminating against all wolves of all shapes and colors. I thought this was going to lead to a message about not generalizing groups of people, but that never came. The story is generic, but what really pulled me in was the rich characters and the rich world they inhabit. Colfer took a clever take on many of the well known fairy tale characters.<br /><br />My favorite character was the Evil Queen. I really enjoyed her back story. I could not get The Mayor from Once Upon A Time out of my head whenever I imagined the Evil Queen.<br /><br />In the end. I give this book a 3/5. Now, this is my rating for me, a 23 year old man, reading this. If I was age 10 to 12, I would probably have given this a very strong 5. I recommend this to anyone interested in fairy tales and magical worlds. I recommend this even more so to a younger audience. If you have a niece, nephew, son, daughter, or if you just know a youngling that likes fairy tales, this would be a PERFECT gift!<br /><br />-PAULof all shapes and colors.

B007MDB71O|4.0|It might surprise many people to find that many of our most revered adventure films hearken back to the era of the pulps for inspiration; the most glaring (and possibly best) example of that of course being the INDIANA JONES films. But there's also some brand-recognition that's at work at times to, more specifically with the recent (and amazingly awful) reboot of CONAN THE BARBARIAN. When director Andrew Stanton, director of two of the most beloved films in recent years (the beautiful FINDING NEMO and the Kubrick-with-a-heart genius of WALL-E, which I consider to be the best animated film ever made), decided to make his first jump into live-action films, he also looked back to the pulps. In this instance, he looked to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, and less-famously, the tale of a Confederate Civil War soldier thrust onto the Red Planet as originally told in the book \\"The Princess of Mars\\". While the film itself surrounds the adventures of the titular character, the real star of JOHN CARTER is Stanton and the deftness and joy that he tells this tale which, aside from a few missteps and some less-than-stellar characterization, is a rousing pulp sci-fi adventure extravaganza with some of the most eye-poppingly amazing visuals of a film since AVATAR.<br /><br />This film has a cast that is to die for... aside from its star. You have Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris (The princess of the tale whose only other real claim to film is X-MEN ORIGINS: WOVERINE as Silverfox) who plays her as an intelligent, quirky, beautiful and deadly woman; Ciaran Hinds, James Purefoy and the voice of Polly Walker who all are there to bring the same charm or gravity that they brought to their respective characters in HBO's brilliant series ROME; Dominic West (best known from THE WIRE) as Sab Than, the would-be puppet tyrant of Barsoom; Mark Strong (the British heavy in just about every film from SHERLOCK HOLMES to GREEN LANTERN) as Matai Shang, the immortal who looks to control the fate of Barsoom; Bryan Cranston in an unrecognizable but important role; and the voice talents of Willem Dafoe (who also worked with Stanton on FINDING NEMO) as Tars Tarkas, Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) as Sola, and Thomas Haden Church as Tal Hajus.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch as Carter lacks a certain consistency in his characterization. He has charm and is ruggedly handsome, but he lacks the leading-man charisma a role like this requires. The writing by Stanton, Michael Chabon, and Mark Andrews, who have a number of characters to deal with, a great deal of plot and exposition and to combine all of this with some bravura action set-pieces hurts the film somewhat in terms of characterization and may seem like a waste of talent in some cases, but each actor has their moment to shine, no matter the size of the part. The real winner, cast-wise, is Collins, who is so strong in her performance that I want to see her in more roles, and would love to see a film based just around her character. But the film is strong enough on its other merits to maintain great interest in the characters and the story to see it all the way through and still have a terrific time.<br /><br />The biggest winner here is sadly the biggest loser of everyone involved here, and that is Andrew Stanton. He directs the film with an eye for spectacle, precision of detail, and most appropriately, a strong sense of fun; the best example of this is the scene in which Carter leaps from ship to ship eventually meeting and fighting alongside Dejah. It's an incredible moment in the film because of just how well each moment is orchestrated. He tells the story of the film with a visual assuredness that rivals that of more experienced live-action filmmakers, and the filmmakers assembled a fantasic crew of digital and practical effects artists so that the interaction between the human/humanoid actors and the CG characters is totally seamless. Unfortunately, the film was something of a colossal bustat the box office due to exceedingly luke-warm reviews, an epically poor marketing campaign, and the natural comparisons between this film and AVATAR. I would watch this film a hundred more times before I would ever even think of watching AVATAR again, but it's a comparison worth making. So because of all this, the \\"failure\\" of this film to reach the heights it was intended to hit is all on Stanton's shoulders, which may hurt his ability to continue making live-action films. Although, looking at the reviews on Amazon, this film might receive some new life on home video, and the disconnect that exists between the marketing of the film and getting audiences in the theaters may now start to dissipate via word of mouth.<br /><br />When all is said and done, JOHN CARTER is a exciting pulp-flavored visual feast with something for everyone, and I can only hope that everyone can watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />4/5 Stars.at the box office due to exceedingly luke-warm reviews, an epically poor marketing campaign, and the natural comparisons between this film and AVATAR.

B005LAJ22Q|2.0|If you think a wafer-thin subplot about finding a dumb little girl who got lost in the first episode is enough to hang several episodes on, this show is for you. If you think that budget cuts resulting in the cast spending many, many episodes on a rental farm is exciting, then this show is for you. If you think that despicable people acting like snotty brats from a high-brow soap opera is characterization, you'll really love this one. People acting like simulacra of people rather than real people...heh, that's always fun. The pregnancy dilemma, the walkers in a barn dilemma, the naval-gazing guilt, the endless accusations and holier-than-thou progressive liberal posturing...man, this show is tedious. Repetitive. Slow. Why do these people even stick together if they hate each other so much? That's pushing disbelief into Lost territory...and we all know how much fun that epic load of junk was.<br /><br />Season 1 was quite polished and held enormous promise. Season 2 is studio-driven pablum for people who think that telling \\"high-brow\\" zombie stories is the pinnacle of TV horror. Think about it...if you take out the zombies and just make this a plague series, you're left with a wishy-washy drama filled with people who do dumb things, make stupid decisions and snap judgments, and react like children.<br /><br />Move along.

B000059TEQ|4.0|After reading the book for a book-group challenge I had an urge to watch the movie also.  I was not disappointed.  Like the book (see my separate review of that) it was just simple, just about love without any unnecessary drama.  It followed the book to the letter without change or embellishment which is just what I wanted to see.  If you are going to watch this movie I would recommend reading the book first as they just go together like, well, Oliver and Jennifer!<br /><br />I have dropped a star because Ali McGraw just was not a good actor in this, very forced and wooden and also because Jennifer looked far too healthy when she was on her deathbed - surely they had some pale makeup even back in 1970!!<br /><br />It also made me think about whether it would have been actually possible for them to pay Harvard Law School tuition on the money they were making from Jenny's job and their summer jobs.  Ok, I know it is a movie and I am slightly overthinking it but this picked away at my brain a bit.  Surprisingly it never occurred to me while reading the book.<br /><br />The appearance of a very young Tommy Lee Jones (or Tom Lee Jones as he called himself then) brought a big smile to my face.<br /><br />A classic anyone who loves love should watch.

0553801473|4.0|A Dance With Dragons is essentially A Feast for Crows, Part II.  Both books take place immediately after the (insane) events of A Storm of Swords, and both books feature fewer major events than their predecessors.  A Dance with Dragons emerges as the better of the two due to its point-of-view characters being those more central to the series' overall story.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons has been criticized for being overlong, with \\"not much happening.\\"  Some reviews express the opinion that Martin's world has grown too large and his characters too spread out; many reviewers doubt that he will be able to bring them back together for a satisfying conclusion in the final two books.  I disagree.  It's true that this book doesn't feature the earth-shattering events of A Storm of Swords, but its description of the aftermath of these events is clearly moving the series toward its conclusion.  On the Wall, the Free Folk are being welcomed as allies against the greater threat of the Others.  In Mereen, Daenerys struggles with her abilities as a ruler, and she finally gets to use--albeit in a limited sense--those lovely lizards of hers.  In and near King's Landing, Varys and a young man with his sights on the throne complicate the Lannisters' plan to salvage the realm.  All of these events are important to the main plots of the series: the Others' return, Daenerys' journey home, and the Westeros \\"game of thrones.\\"<br /><br />Are events moving as quickly as some would like?  Perhaps not.  But, to be fair, the series has had to change course multiple times in only a few volumes, and Martin is not unwise in taking the time to explore the consequences of his previous books.  Before a certain execution in the first book, I would never have anticipated the large-scale civil war that occurred in the second book.  Similarly, the events of the Red Wedding essentially ended the War of the Five Kings, so the fourth and fifth books take the form of the remaining pieces aligning themselves for the battles to come.  \\"Should it take two full volumes to do so?\\" I hear critics cry.  It's a fair criticism, but I think it's one that applies more to 'Feast' than 'Dance.'  The experiences of Cercei, Brienne, and Jaime, while interesting from a character perspective, probably could have been edited down significantly without impacting the main story.  The characters of 'Feast' just aren't as critical to the story as Daenerys, Tyrion, and Jon Snow, and, in retrospect, it might have been better to combine the two volumes into a single work.<br /><br />This observation doesn't diminish the value of the fifth book itself, which stands on its own as a fine addition to the series.  There are wonderful opportunities for characters to grow in this volume, from Jon Snow's \\"Kill the boy\\" to Theon's character turnaround to Daenerys' confronting her own fallibility as a queen.  If Martin can make me root for Theon Greyjoy again, his storytelling prowess is clearly still strong.  It's true that Martin makes too much use of the \\"character-in-peril cliffhanger,\\" but we had these in book two (Bran and Rickon, Tyrion) and book three (Arya), and, while annoying, they are infrequent enough that they don't greatly detract from the book's overall impact.  Yes, there were no major battles in this book, but neither was there in A Game of Thrones.  As with the first book in the series, A Dance with Dragons is all about character development, and it thrives because of this.  The pieces are in place for The Winds of Winter to be filled with the spectacular action sequences that fans of the series love.  I can't wait!
B007Q476KU|5.0|Loved this movie very well done. I loved the way the faces of the horses were captured. Never thought how important the horses were during the war. This movie shows how hard horses work and how loyal they are.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I fell in love with Elantris immediately, and was hooked as a Sanderson fan.  I loved Mistborn: The Final Empire, and while I don't feel that the second and third books lived up to the first, I still enjoyed them heartily.  Warbreaker was a bit of a disappointment, so I was wary about The Way of Kings.  And I was wrong to doubt, because it is by far his best yet!  I cannot wait for more!

B008S0TAY6|1.0|I haven't gotten to read this issue yet because, like the last issue, amazons only making it available on the Kindle Fire or Android platform.  However, all the rest were available on the iPad.<br /><br />I love the series by the way.  This is a specific ding against Amazon for trying to tie to their reader, while having software on competing platforms.  This is no longer the \\"Kindle Edition.\\"

Repinned, changed boards.. so far works great - MUCH easier than using the mobile web browser! Read the other reviews.. sorry but I think some review to be read,  not to report.  I will test this out and update if needed,  but so far so good!
B000002A3T|5.0|After many years of enjoying Pink Floyd's music, I feel the Division Bell may indeed be their best album.  The Division Bell grows on you, with each listen, and all the right ingredients of great music and lyrics are there to make it an enjoyable experience.  I understand there is a lot of disagreement, among Pink Floyd fans, over who carries Pink Floyd's legacy, although the Division Bell further proves that David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason made excellent music, together, without the input of Roger Waters.<br />  On July 6, 1977, I was fortunate enough to see Pink Floyd play at Montreal's Olympic Stadium during the Animals tour.  At the time, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were still all the buzz in most people's heads, since Animals had just been released and was not yet as known as those previous two albums.  Imagine that I was able to attend that concert in Montreal for $25, after purchasing a ticket in Plattsburgh, NY which included bus service to and from the concert, as well as admission to see the show.  In addition, there was a keg of beer also provided, in the rear of the bus, which made the trip to Montreal that day all the more memorable.  Back in those days, crossing the border, into Canada, was as simple as declaring one's citizenship and how long you planned to be there, but I don't believe the border guards even bothered to come onto the bus, because everyone knew Pink Floyd was going to be playing in Montreal and by the sound coming from the bus it was probably evident where we were going!  The concert was general admission and me and a friend found ourselves sitting on the grass around 400 yards in front of stage.  There were people walking around, with their faces painted, and all types of drugs being shared and/or consumed, as mental preparation for Pink Floyd to take the stage was highly anticipated by all.  A distinct white cloud of smoke hovered over the crowd, emitted from the collective sharing of joints that circulated among the over 90,000 people in Olympic Stadium that day.  The weather was perfect and no one was thinking who was the best member of Pink Floyd, or what turn their music would take in the future, because many, including myself, had also heard Meddle, Ummagumma or Obscured by Clouds and knew this band was always capable of producing quality music, even after the bar had been set so high with the release of Dark Side of the Moon.  Even David Bowie's version of See Emily Play on his Pinups album was a compliment to the band, since Mick Ronson was such a great guitarist.<br />  As the concert got underway, the crowd was treated to the amazing live performance of nearly the entire Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here Albums with songs from Animals including in the mix.  At one point in the show, a sixty foot helium pig was inflated and began its slow trek high over the crowd in Olympic stadium, but someone in the crowd fired a bottle rocket and the pig was sent back to the stage area and deflated.  An exploding helium balloon would not be welcome by anyone and I understand it was during this concert that Roger Waters began to feel there was a Wall separating himself from the audience.  The seeds for the next album were now being sown and no one but Roger Waters truly knows whether it was his ego or paranoia that forced him away from the band.  Now, 35 years later, I feel the Wall was when Roger Waters showed the rest of us that he began to take himself too seriously and a division was also created between himself and the other members of Pink Floyd.  The usual tempo and flow of music that makes Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, as well as Animals, such enjoyable albums began to fade with the release of The Wall.  I understand it was Roger's insistence on playing all the instruments, as well as writing the lyrics, that created the greatest division among members of Pink Floyd and we the fans must ask ourselves if it wasn't a good thing that DavidGilmour wanted to prove his contributions to Pink Floyd by carrying on their music.  The best song on The Wall is Comfortably Numb written and song by who?  The same man who continued to carry the Pink Floyd banner, with Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell, with the help of Richard Wright and Nick Mason.  If you listen to Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking you will hear the point I'm making, carried to extreme, with Roger Water's screaming.  David Gilmour is not capable of such nonsense and The Division Bell is a return to form for Pink Floyd.  I only recently purchased The Division Bell, providing myself a time capsule of enjoyment, because I've always enjoyed the solo albums of Richard Wright and David Gilmour so much.  Richard Wright's Wet Dream is pure pleasure and David Gilmour's three solo albums are equally great as his contributions with Pink Floyd.<br />  As a side note, I also saw Emerson, Lake and Palmer at the Olympic Stadium, later that same year, as they were accompanied by an 80 piece orchestra, which was only used in Montreal and New York, before being dropped because it was too expensive.  I arrived at the Emerson, Lake and Palmer concert in Montreal on another bus trip from Plattsburg except this time I only paid $18.50!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I want to start off by saying this is only my second \\"review\\" for any of my items since becoming an amazon buyer. You can chalk that up to laziness haha. However, after reading the negative reviews on this item I felt the need to add my two sense in here. This case is absolutely wonderful!! It is \\"lighter\\" than I would have thought but that in no way detracts from the durable feel of the item. The stand works great for me. Maybe I'm easier on the item then some others? Or it may be that I have a lighter touch. Regardless of the reason, I have yet to find fault with this case. In my opinion, it in no way feels cheap. I've had this for awhile now (at least a few months) and while the strap might be glued on, it is still as tight as the first day it came in. Another amazing thing is that I have yet to scratch or damage the case in any way. But again, this may be because I am not hard on my items. I do have two toddlers that are obsessed with my electronic devices though and they have not even come close to damaging the case ( the few times they have snuck it away for a quick playtime fun)<br /><br />All in all, I give this a full 5 stars. It's a great simple case that more than satisfies my needs for it!

030758836X|1.0|From one of her first books, I thought Flynn would emerge as a fresh contemporary voice of a new writing generation. Instead, in this awful effort, she's emerged as another hackneyed, untalented grind-it-out-for-bucks author. She has no idea how to capture the voice of the male characters. A tough guy doesn't talk like this. And the lead female? Throws the women's movement back into the stone age. It's painfully laborious to make one's way through this tripe.
0553386794|5.0|Read the other reviews for content - I can't add more - GOT is a great book! I'll review the book itself - YOU WANT THIS PARTICULAR, SLIGHTLY LARGER PAPERBACK. GOT takes a while to read. You might as well enjoy the experience: larger type/spacing, larger pages, nicer paper/stays open more easily, making it easier to handle. Most importantly the map and all it's labels are legible. I'm now reading Clash of Kings which I bought in a mad rush at B&N - but it's the itty bitty paperback: about 3\\" thick, hard to hold/keep open, smaller type and tighter spacing. The map labels are nearly impossible to read. I gave away this nice copy of Game of Thrones - wish I'd kept it just to refer back to the map.
B003KVNV4S|5.0|If you like it you'll like it, if you don't like it you won't.  People spin an arbitrary review however they want about everything and anything.  Music is music, The National is The National.  I am not the last line of defense between you and the one click button.  Do what you want, listen to what you want to and buy what music you like.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am not afraid or ashamed to say it - I love 50 Shades of Grey and I love this book! This book does have some similarities with 50 Shades, but then again - what romance/erotic novel doesn't?? It also is better written (not as repetitive, more mature) and the female protagonist is strong and way more enjoyable to read about! I loved the fact that she wasn't a virgin. She knew what she wanted and was comfortable with herself. In all, a great read.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|just want to keep playing and playing . very relaxing but a great challenge non the less. just what the doctor ordered after a very stressfull day!!
B004SC7B6M|5.0|This is hands down the best album Within Temptation has released, second perhaps to The Silent Force. Discounting the inherent strength of Within Temptation's musical style, the second biggest strength of this album is the beat - many of the songs infectiously drive you to MOVE to the sounds coming through your speakers, and those that don't are still the same greatness we've come to expect from Within Temptation. Sharon Den Adel's voice has always been hauntingly beautiful, and it helps that she and her band members have managed to remain humble for the nearly 15 years they've been a band; there's no pettiness from any of them.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Within Temptation, just buy this album in its entirety. The songs are the stuff legends are made of, the band members are awesome people that actually deserve your money, and you get a discount for buying all the songs anyway. So what are you waiting for? :D
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is a great app for the kindle fire for relaxation background noise.  I got the free version and then payed for the upgrade sounds.  Great for a nursery.

1926778103|4.0|I started keeping up with \\"Joe Mad\\" when he began his stint on the Uncanny X-Men comics in the 90's; ever since then I have tried to get my hands on EVERYTHING that he's created. His art style is so unique (atleast it was until everyone began imitating it) and engaging that it's impossible not to love. I even tried to keep up with him through his Cliffhanger days when he couldn't meet the deadline on his Battle Chasers comic to save his life (you can get the collected edition of those on Amazon too, it's pretty pricey but worth the $)! Needless to say, I was quite sad when Joe announced he was going to hang up his pencils and make the jump to video games. Imagine my surprise when they released this book! Almost every review on here would agree that the content of this book is fantastic. It's amazing the amount of work that Joe has put into creating this game's world and its' characters (if only he would have put that much work into Battle Chasers!). Based on content alone the book would get a perfect \\"5\\", but the other reviewers were right about the crappy binding. The book does fall apart quickly. I wanted to give the book a lower rating based on its' shotty binding, but I just couldn't do it with such amazing content! Bottom line, if you're a Joe Mad fan then you need this book, but be warned that the binding glue does not hold so be careful with it.
B000050FEN|5.0|The DVD package was excellent. One disk has the movie and the other has special features, etc. Quality was EXCELLENT, and sound was GREAT as well.<br /><br />This movie was well written and very well acted out. Morgan Freeman was the perfect fit for Det. Somerset and Brad Pitt played his character extremely well. In my opinion anything Morgan Freeman plays in will be a hit!<br /><br />This movie is a great detective thriller with some horror chills in it. I have seen it many times and plan to watch it many more. Excellent movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a magnificent author. She added things at the right time. The violent dark intensed parts had me turning and turning. I would pay 30 dollars to read the trilogy. This book has the perfect plot, perfect characters, and a perfect book. I mean who could ask for anything more???

B005RRDKYE|5.0|The movie has no real parallels. It is Napoleon Dynamite quirky, and slightly reminiscent of 60's acid films (which may be the best way to watch this movie.) Scott Pilgrim is in a band with Stephen Stills and a guy name Young Neil waiting in the wings. He is currently dating a 17 year old Chinese school girl who wears Catholic school uniforms. Her name is Knives. They play video games together. Scott has a dream about a girl, then meets her in real life. They start to date and now he finds out if they are to continue dating he must fight (literally) her 7 ex-boyfriends. These fights take on the characteristics of video game battles complete with Batman like \\"Zonk\\" words, special effects, and magical weapons. The humor is at times laugh out loud funny. The dialogue is extremely clever and witty. Scott also lives with (shares a bed with) a gay roommate (Wallace), although Scott is not gay. Wallace has the ability to immediately text message Scott's sister whenever something happens in Scott's life. He can even do it passed out drunk. If you liked this film you might also enjoy \\"Kick-Ass\\" which also boasts quirky humor and special fight effects.<br /><br />No nudity. No foul language. Adult situations. WARNING: This film is not for everyone. You will either love it or turn it off after 20 minutes. Instant cult classic.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|Like the movie.  Not as good as MI:2 but better than I and III (imho).  I'm not going to debate Tom Cruise's acting or the video quality - others have done that very well already.<br /><br />What earns this title 5 stars for me is that Paramount opted for CHOICE!  I can choose an iTunes digital copy or Ultraviolet.  I'm also not going to be sucked down into the debate pit about which format is better.  I prefer iTunes but others might like the new Ultraviolet.  Lately, there have been a flotilla of titles that have been Ultraviolet only.  And with the exception of Deathly Hallows, the studios have been unwilling to trade leaving me with a format I can't use.  So, empathy for those who did not want to or could not use iTunes and the only choice available was iTunes.<br /><br />Bravo Paramount for good customer service!  Let's vote with our dollars and support this kind of product!<br /><br />Matthew
B005OYKI1I|5.0|** MINOR PLOT SYNOPSIS (MINUS ENDING)**<br /><br />Vin Diesel is busted out of prison and is reunited with his sister Jordana Brewster (who I fell in love with in D.E.B.S.) and her bf Paul Walker in Rio, the most recognized skyline in the world. They are bad guys stealing cars off a train. As things turned out, these were cars seized by the Brazilian DEA, who for some reason unlike their American counterparts don't disable the vehicles. Due to infighting, the effort is partially botched and Vin Diesel and Walker end up as captives of a Rio mobster. They discover he wants one of the cars back real bad. After they escape they dismantle the car to find out way.<br /><br />Meanwhile Dwayne Johnson comes down from the US to take back Vin Diesel. It seems the US has jurisdiction in Brazil, but hey its a movie. From a chip in the vehicle, Vin Diesel discovers that the crime boss has money stored in various cash houses throughout the city. Walker and Vin Diesel assemble a Mission Impossible team to go after the cash. They attack the first cash house and burn the money which forces the mobster to relocate all his eggs into one basket. As it turns out, that basket is inside the evidence safe at the police station, making the task of that one last hit a bit more difficult. At this point the movie takes a few interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />The plot contains numerous implausibilities as does most Mission Impossible action movies, vehicles that can bust through concrete walls (that never use rebar), and don't even scratch the head lights. The ending will keep Myth Busters busy for a season.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|After all the fuss about this series I downloaded to my IPad with great expectations of something different. Alas was very disappointed. Firstly, it took a while to get past the very young writing style. Secondly, was expecting some pretty steamy scenes - but again .....the sex scenes weren't anything you can't read in a Mills and Boon Blaze.<br />Overall, the story, although predictable, was sweet - a fairly standard love story where the power of love redeems the beast.

B002XMGJHG|4.0|I like many heard \\"The Final Countdown\\" and that's how I know of Europe. After hearing this, I can say that I now question why this album didn't get them success. This album is a good example of what Melodic Metal sounds like. I also love the energy and passion behind most of the songs on here. Even the ones I'm not too fond of don't fail to please! And Joey's voice is golden here! The rest of the band is also in their prime and if they have more albums that sound like this, then I want to know which ones to look for.<br /><br />The Music:<br /><br />1. \\"Stormwind\\"- AMAZING guitar opening! I can feel the passion in just the guitar playing at the beginning! And Joey's voice sounds very open and great. Not like some of the more nasal vocals he does later. I do find this one to be one of their very best songs on here. The music just plain rocks, the vocals couldn't have been done any better, and they aren't doing this for MTV or anyone; they are just making music that sounds good and that's what makes this better than their other works. Great song!<br /><br />2. \\"Scream of Anger\\"- This one sounds heavier from the beginning. A little bit like Judas Priest or another metal band. I like this one though. As a huge power metal fan, I love that this might have influenced power metal with the double bass drumming and the melodies here. The vocals are again top notch and the drumming hauls here. Great song!<br /><br />3. \\"Open Your Heart\\"- This is the original version of the same song on their 1988 album. That one is all drowned in keyboards and drained of the passion and emotion that this version stands for. This one is clearly the better version of the song because his voice sounds better, but on top of that, more passionate. The music is also just very easy, and passionate, nothing that sounds forced or out of place. Also it sounds a heck of a lot better with the keys being used mainly as a background thing on this version than in the front doing lots of counter melodies. yeah, I don't know why they would re-do this song, because this version is PERFECT, and the famous one is crap. But, yes, it's a great song, and I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />4. \\"Treated Bad Again\\"- This one is a harder-edged blues-rock song. It sounds good, but it's not my style of music. It flows nicely on the album and the guitar work isn't fancy but impressive and it'll sound good to others but my opinion is it's not the best here.<br /><br />5. \\"Aphasia\\"- This one's an instrumental full of amazing guitar work, impressive drum fills, galloping bass lines and some backing keys. This rivals some of the instrumentals I've heard from RUSH at being catchy while technical. I mean the only thing in this song that shows technical chops is the guitar part. The drums are harder than a pop song, but they aren't anything too fancy like Neil Peart or Mike Portnoy. Great Instrumental though, I love it!<br /><br />6. \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\"- This one is an epic rock/metal track. While there's no double bass, this one rings power metal as well. This one has all the elements that make a good power metal song (minus double bass) and it sounds great. It has that 80's passion and flavor that gives it something unique. Great, highly recommended song!<br /><br />7. \\"Wasted Time\\"- This one is a little more on the epic side than the others due to the pitches and notes that are being played by the keys giving it a dramatic atmosphere. It is a good song and I like the galloping guitar part during the chorus. This song is high in energy and Joey sounds very inspired here. He even uses a little bit of edge in his voice at points. This one's a good song.<br /><br />8. \\"Lyin' Eyes\\"- This one isn't the best one here, but it is another Judas Priest-esque song. It isn't a favorite of mine, but it does rock and have a driving guitar part. Others may like it more, but to me, it's not that bad, but I'm not thrilled by it either.<br /><br />9. \\"Dreamer\\"- Ok, is it just me, or does the piano intro and the chorus of this song remind you of Infinity-era Journey? I just think it has that 70's Steve Perry Journey ring to it. Anyway, this song is a ballad and both \\"Open Your Heart\\" and this one are GREAT ballads. I like \\"Open Your Heart\\" more in terms of vocal work, but I like the musical work on this song better. This one is mellower and has less power, but it's more of a relaxing song. Great song none the less!<br /><br />10. \\"Dance the Night Away\\"- This one is a party type song and closes this album off. I'm not too big of a fan of it, but like I keep saying, it's not outta place, it's just a difference in opinion from person to person. It does have some rather cool guitar stuff going on, but I just don't care for it.<br /><br />Verdict: This album is great for fans of: Judas Priest (I'm not a fan, but a lot of this sounds similar to 80's Priest), Iron Maiden (Not really cause it sounds like it, but because it has a metal influence in it), Journey, and other 80's bands of this sort. I haven't heard all of TFC album, but I've listened to some of it, then found other things to listen to while this one kept my attention. It just has a better quality to it than typical Commercial Europe. Great album and highly recommended!
B008J05EL8|5.0|All the previous reviews should be removed as totally irrelevant. Are you, people, reviewing the app package or the developer's business practices? I know that for a cheapskate any price is an unbearable price.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie captures the horror of being drafted into a hopeless battle perfectly. I have read the books, and the movie changes only a few minor details. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible (as always). I can't wait for part 2 and 3.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I loved the app at first but then realized they were spying on me and so uninstalled.  This app collects your personal info, who you are, your name, phone number, google account info and other contact data.  Disturbing.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book And I couldn't put it down.... I have read the Complete series without reading others judgement on the books or googling it because I didn't want to be persuasive by someelse judgement .. I am glad that I didn't read other people comments.. I loved the book :) but judge it yourself.<br /><br /> It's a fiction book!! So don't over analyze it..
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book!  i was on a 5 day vacation in Maui and ordered it for my kindle to lay around and read.  I ended up buying book two before i flew home:)<br />The only hard thing for me was that everyone has like 3 different names, so initially that can get confusing.  Also some people's names look similar, so if you are reading it fast you think they are talking about the brother, when they mean the father, etc...  Not a big deal, but it made me have to re-read a few pages to get my story straight.<br />All of the plot lines are so well thought out and i can really feel the effort that was put into this book.  I dont re-read books, but this one I will:)

B008YL7MSA|5.0|I just received this collector's edition from Best Buy for only $29.99! The packaging is beautiful. The 4-disc collection includes the Blu-ray version of the film (disc 1), the Blu-ray version of the special features(disc 2), the dvd version of the film (disc 3), the dvd version of the special features (disc 4), digital copy & ultraviolet. The special features are \\"Game Maker: Suzanne Collins And The Hunger Games Phenomenon,\\" \\"The World Is Watching: Making The Hunger Games,\\" \\"Letters From The Rose Garden,\\" \\"Controlling The Games,\\" \\"A Conversation With Gary Ross And Elvis Mitchell,\\" \\"Propaganda Film,\\" \\"Marketing Archive,\\" and a Blu-ray exclusive, \\"Preparing For The Games: A Director's Process.\\" There is also a nice acrylic keepsake displaying Katniss' pin in flames. The film looks beautiful on Blu-ray and if you have a home theatre system, you'll be impressed. This was given to me as a gift and I couldn't be happier! Enjoy!
1936608898|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, especially the way in which the scientific information was made very accessible for people with little to no background in any science or nutrition! I am excited to share this book with friends and family who just can't seem to wrap their heads around why I no longer eat grains or processed foods. The \\"strictness\\" of the Whole30 is also presented as it is, with clear, concise, logical and \\"tough-love\\" explanations for why it must be so, yet the authors are down-to-earth and practical when giving their advice on how to make it a sustainable lifestyle, rather than a temporary 30-day \\"diet.\\" I highly recommend this book, for those who are already practicing a paleo/primal lifestyle, and for those who may be new to it and/or suspicious/skeptical about the way in which it is often presented as a fad \\"caveman\\" diet -- this book is a fantastically written explanation of the science behind eating whole, real foods (which is at the heart of paleo/primal living, anyway!!!)
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Thanks for making this game.  It has brought me many hours of something to do.  If you like something to do buy Star Traders yeah?
B008XG1X18|5.0|Is used for Android Beam, taking your phone and putting it against another android phone to share information. You people are ridiculous.
034580404X|4.0|After all of the hype I thought I better jump on the bandwagon. I thought the story line made sense and flowed however the passionate parts lacked, I'm half way through the second book and I'll let you know what I think
1936608898|5.0|What a great book.  I had spent some time on their website, which has most of the information, but the book puts it all together in one place.  I enjoyed reading through it and finished in one night.<br /><br />What I liked the best was their treatment of how you make decisions with what you eat.  Very insightful.  I am just finishing my first Whole30, this book was what I needed to go from putting my toe in the water to jumping in.<br /><br />Bottom line - their approach can work for anyone.  It is extreme but not impossible, and you don't have to be hungry!  I look better, feel better, and perform better after implementing their approach.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is the type of book that you hope you find every time you crack the cover of a new book. It's starts off and while difficult to follow at first, once you get a field for the world being created it's easy to be sucked into the story. I had a hard time putting in down and I'm thankful that the 2nd book hasn't been released yet, because my work has suffered enough as is.
B007EC6FIS|1.0|I'm really at a lost with this album, nothing in the album was catchy or memorable. I just felt bored, even the piano (which I love) was weak. I still think the second album they put out was their best and hope that someday they'll put something out that grabs me like that did.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The book, Dracula, was exciting, it was full of mystery, and one never knew what was going to happen next, it is worth while reading.

B0012GMV4O|5.0|Great cd featuring one of the best guitarist anywhere Leslie West along with the late great bassist producer vocalist Felix Pappalardi. Long gone is the era of heavy bands who can write & play like this. As a matter of fact that goes for most bands these days who can barely write & play they're instruments! Almost no guitarist these days even comes close to this tone & musicianship! If your a musician or even not, pick this one up!
B004BC7MRM|2.0|I loved Kid Rock's Devil album but this reminds me of a time when Garth decided to branch into rock and roll and It didn't go well because what fans loved about the artist's music was being changed. I hope Kid Rock will stick to his \\"Devil\\" type genre.

B00101ZOTK|5.0|Excellent movie that warrants seeing many times.  The writing and acting far exceed the normal tripe tossed out by Hollywood.
B0086700CM|5.0|Excellent game.It has a very good upgrade system.  Keeps you coming back for more.  I highly recommend this fantastic game.
B006DHAT5K|3.0|If ever there was an example of a romantic comedy in need of sexual chemistry, this is it. Both leads in the film are appealing, talented actors, but it's a stretch to feel any real romantic heat between the two. However, if you're willing to look past that (and I was), you'll find a pleasant 90 minutes of entertainment that is similar to such TV shows as \\"Happy Endings\\" and \\"The New Girl\\" in its vibe and writing.
0765316994|3.0|This book started with so much promise, and if it had ended before the 3 'codas' it would have received a better rating (although it would have been rather short.)  I agree with many of the other reviewers...although the first half is goofy, and the sci-fi makes sense less than a quarter of the time, it is a rather fun romp in a star-trek like world.  However, once this has completed, the codas are just an utter waste of time.  In regards to characters who one has almost no connection with, I kept thinking 'who cares?' throughout the whole thing.  I kept waiting for the main characters from the first half to make some sort of appearance; rest assured that they do not and when the rest of the book finished it was with a sigh of relief from me.  I so wish the first half of the book had been slightly more expanded upon - that was really quite fun, and why I liked the book overall - and could absolutely have done without the codas.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This is the second part to \\"Something Borrowed\\"  both very good books.  I had to remind myself these characters weren't real and to stop thiking about where they are now.  If you are looking for a lot of events in one book- this is the book.  So many things happen there isn't a dull moment.  Also a surprise ending.
B003Y5H5JM|1.0|My only complaint about this is the length.....why is the blue ray 89 min and the regular version 20 minutes longer. This makes absolutely no flipping sense to me. I desperately want to see this movie. But I am not going to pay for an 89 minute blue ray.
1596912863|4.0|Highly entertaining; I thought this book was adorable, creative in the extreme (why didn't *I* think of an Austenland!!?), and kept me turning pages until I had finished it. I've already bought the sequel, [[ASIN:1596912898 Midnight in Austenland: A Novel]], and am waiting for a vacation day when I can just sit and get lost in Austenland again without interruption! :)
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I bought this for my daughter when she was 2 1/2 months old, she played with it until she was about 9 1/2 months old. She really loved this toy and it really helped her learn to crawl. I purchased this from Target for $14.99 and in my mind it was worth every penny.<br /><br />This is a video of her playing with it. [...]<br /><br />When I first purchased this toy my daughter was not liking tummy time very much at all. She HATED to be on her stomach and would get so mad and cry. We tried everything to help her enjoy tummy time but nothing worked. Finally I tried this, even though it was beyond her age level, thinking that if nothing else she could look at herself in the mirror and at the flashing lights. It worked! Instead of spending only a minute or so on her belly she was spending a full 10 minutes at a time, then 30, then soon after that we couldn't get her to lay on her back! She was crawling all over the house!<br /><br />She didn't really 'chase' the snail like it says they can do very often. Sometimes I would roll it and she would go after it though. She would just lay on her belly and laugh at the mirror. When she was sitting up on her own she would lay the snail on its back and spin it around the mirror. Or push it back and forth. Or teeth on the antennae. Or just hit it like a drum. She didn't really play with the ladybug either. But she loved the music and the talking and the lights. For a baby toy she played with it for a really long time considering some of her other ones have only held her interest for 2 weeks.<br /><br />It is very durable, the mirror never scratched and she used to hit it with a wooden spoon. It was easy to clean with an antibacterial wipe, and we never had to buy batteries for it. The batteries that came in it from the store are the same ones in there today. Right now I have it packed up in a box to give to a friend of mine since my daughter has outgrown it. Fisher-Price has been around for ages so its a brand I trust. My daughter has a lot of other Fisher-Price toys that we have been happy with.<br /><br />I can understand why some reviewers have said this toy is not so safe. It is heavy, which is probably my only con. You definitely should not leave a small baby alone with it if you think they might try to pick it up and might drop it on their feet or knock it over on themselves. (My daughter went through a phase when she had first learned to stand where she would pick up the snail while standing and drop it just to hear it thunk on the floor. It barely missed her toes a few times so I took it away from her until she got over it) I don't think its heavy enough to cause real damage, just maybe a little boo boo, but still. At the same time, when babies are in the age range for this toy, they should never be left alone with anything ever, especially if they are playing in the floor. The best thing to do is play with your baby while they are playing with this toy (or any other toy), and that way they can't get hurt. If you are looking for a toy that you can leave your baby with so you can go wash dishes or talk on the phone or check your email or whatever, then this is definitely the wrong one. Go get an Exersaucer or a nanny. If you are willing to sit and play with your baby while they learn and explore, then this is probably a winner.oys that we have been happy with.

B0063IH60K|3.0|It is solataire.  I like the amount of options for a free game but I do not like that the ads pop up each time a new shuffle is done.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|I have no idea why people like this movie. The story is unoriginal--to put it mildly. The premise is absurd. The acting is stiff as cardboard. It stars Sam Worthington. Wow, it is sooo bad. The fact that it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars is all you need to know about that institution.
0375507256|3.0|Only finished this one because of the clever style in which it is written. The author spent the entire book flaunting his obsession with anal sex and demonizing everything Christian, capitalist, or white. How do people like this live to adulthood?
B000002LAC|5.0|Trio is a gift for my husband, who has long been a fan of country music. He is thrilled with it.
0553801473|3.0|With already thousands of comments about the book what more is there to say?<br /><br />While reading the book I am totally engrossed.  Each chapter is well written with lots of details and interesting.<br /><br />The problems are: Characters continue to be added to the point that it is hard to remember who is who. there are multipe kings, queens and princes, and more knights than one can imagine.  There are multiple companies of sellswords.  The are multiple free cities each with their retinue of stange sounding advisors and leaders.  There are at least 4 major religions, and an uncountable number of gods. There are as many plots & schemes as their are charcters.  It is not uncommon for a character be drowned, stabbed or knocked out at the end of a chapter, only to be found alive several chapters later.<br /><br />Two characters who have not seen since the end of book 3 show up at the end of book 5.  Game of Thrones has become like a lot of TV shows that start off amazing but in their suprise popularity jump off the tracks in trying to keep fans interested (e.g. \\"Lost\\").<br /><br />I am not sure if George Martin has it all planned out or is just winging it at this point, but it would seem the vast majority of fans, myself included, would like to see the focus narrow, not broaden. He has built a truly amazing universe. If he could just use the next book or 2 to allow some closure to many of the stories and stabilization to the rule of Westeros, he can then he keep writing books of new adventures, uprisings and stories of different characters and regions.  Let's hope this happens.
0345803485|1.0|Excessive kinky sex and a weak story line make this book borderline pornography.  I wouldn't touch another book in the trilogy.
B005VT42BS|4.0|i highly recommend this app.  It really does what it says and then some, its does maybe a little too much actually.
034580404X|5.0|This purchase was a good one because the books are so much fun to read. And with all my friends reading it at the same time makes it worth wild.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great to check how long you can do a certain activity before battery runs out and to check how long you need to charge. I reccomend this to anybody as a great app.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I'm not really a shinedown \\"fan\\". I have their first album, and I like a couple of their songs. But when I saw this for 99 cents, I figured why not. I would gladly pay (well, I would have, before I didn't) full price for this album. It has everything a good rock album needs. Catchy chords, lyrics, a ballad, a sad song for a rainy day. Its drinking music for good times and bad. For My Sake is a great song, and so is the album. There aren't alot of albums I can listen to first track to last, but this is one. For the money I paid, its easily one of the 5 best albums i've ever bought. Good stuff
0385342063|5.0|I just loved this book. Everything about it was pitch perfect. I really had a feel for Poppy as if she was a friend. I thought it had some great twist and turns, and highly recommend.  Now who can you see in the movie?<br /><br />If Hollywood cast it, movie would be as dull as lifeless as Something Borrowed!<br /><br />This is my dream cast:<br /><br />Poppy - Emma Stone<br />Magnus - Dominic Carter<br />Sam - Tom Mison<br />Mother - Helen Mirren<br />Father - Bill Nighy<br />Vicks - Kristen Scott Thomas<br />Lucinda - Sienna Miller

B004CIIXC8|5.0|This was the first Andrea Arnold film I ever saw and I'm glad I bought it. It's the story that anyone in a dead end situation can relate to. Mia is a lot of teenagers at 15 (lonely,frustrated, depressed) and her environment doesn't help at all. Living with in a housing project with her foul mouthed little sister and young mom (who sees her as competition) is a trying experience to say the least. she does have something going for her... dance(kinda). Mia is real into hip hop culture and wants to become a dancer(see the movie for the result)the films soundtrack go's great with every scene and certain plot points prove that \\"life's a bitch\\". This film is so great in that it captures the broken spirit of the characters and you feel like your watching real people deal with real issues. As a American it was refreshing to see another side of London (The ghetto)and that's one of the things I loved about the film.So in closing a round of applause for Andrea Arnold and the cast for a terrific movie and the criterion collection for bringing it stateside. Go see this asap
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I got into the books around six months ago and although I loved both the film and book I felt like the \\"Hunger Games\\" part of the movie felt a bit rushed, I do wish they made it longer and showed certain parts that the book talked about. But nevertheless a fantastic movie, for both newcomers of the series and fans alike. Highly recommend it to anyone. :D
1400169615|1.0|If you wish to bask in the fruits of F. Scott Fitzgerald's powerful penning, I suggest you avoid this audiobook.  While undoubtedly well-meant, the narrator's obsession with enunciation becomes quite annoying when prolonged over a 15-hour period.  Passionate dialogue and magnificent descriptions rapidly grow dissatisfying and forced when inflicted with the meticulous pronunciation of even the most common words.  Thankfully, there is an alternative in the version rendered (superbly) by William Dufris.  It is both cheaper and far more enjoyable than this disappointing interpretation of Fitzgerald's timeless work.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This show is written and performed brilliantly.  The storyline follows an English Lord's family and their household servants in the country, spanning from the sinking of the titanic, through the World War and beyond. It covers the dilemma faced by the family when the heir apparent is reported lost with the sinking of the titanic, to the eldest daughter's marriage prospects, the youngest daughters love for a commoner and the servants machinations to further themselves.  The characters have engaging depth, rich dialogue, and are surprisingly able to evoke sympathy even when doing the unspeakable.<br /><br />The chararcters evolve from season to season, giving the viewer a genuine sensation of peeking into their lives through time, while developing a sense of attachment.  The show depicts the class differences as well as the strict laws governing inheritance in England with deft clarity and authenticity.<br /><br />The costumes and the countryside are pleasing to the eye and elicit wistfulness. The formality of the speech, inherent to the period, makes one long for the days where abbreviations and speaking in slang were frowned upon.<br /><br />I truly loved this show and am looking forward to the release of the new season.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an excellent read. Think everyone should get something out of this book. Makes you wonder are there any real Christian Greys
B008COII1Y|3.0|Watched the Amazon Instant vid. The trailers really hooked me but I found the complete product to be pretty slow and the soundtrack was horrendous as I had to have the music irritateingly (is that a word?) loud just to barely hear the dialouge/narration. It was good enough to get through but I wouldn't add it to my collection unless I see it somewhere for a buck or two. Neat idea though.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I have to admit, I stayed away from restaurants for a few months after finishing this book.  It's one thing to think chef's let food drop on the dirty floor, then pick it up and keep cooking.  It's another thing to know it to be true.  But that's what this book is all about, telling it like it is.  Peeling back the trimmings and peering into the underbelly of kitchen life.  From chefs having sex with bride's at their reception dinner to a standard day in the life of a top chef, it's all here in it's dirty glory.  Looking around at modern restaurants though, I've been wondering if this book spawned the open kitchen movement where almost all restaurants in California now have taken down the solid wall between tables and chefs.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|as good as farmville and pioneer trail .  I'm having a blast playing.  just don't like being required so many words.
B006PTZNRU|5.0|ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!! LOVE THE MUSIC AND IT IS PERFECT FOR JUST CHILL LISTENING WHILE CLEANING THE HOUSE OR JUST TO RELAX
B0041KKYGU|5.0|As a teacher myself, this movie was very cathartic.  Cameron Diaz plays the world's worst teacher sleepwalking her way to a paycheck until she hatches a plan to turn her life around.  But it's not so much the plot that matters, but the jokes.  And this movie is damn funny.  Raunchy as all get out, but funny.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I knew nothing about this book when I picked it up. I simply based my purchase on reviews. I wasn't disappointed but probably would not have purchased it if I would have read what it was about beforehand. With that said...<br /><br />I liked it. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about Ender's world and his dilemma. The book was thought-provoking and very clever. I was sad, mad, angry and lonely for Ender. I love a book that can develop the character that well - to allow the reader to sympathize for the main character.<br /><br />As a girl, I would have loved a love component to the book - but other than that it was a fun read. I liked it - not a light, sunny beach read but worth it if you like military or sci-fi.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I stayed up all night to finish this book. I couldn't put it down!<br />The very real and deep relationships between the characters (all of them) was so well written. I didn't know what Slam poetry was before I read the book. I was a little turned off by the idea of it. But, many friends INSISTED I must read it. They were right. I cried, laughed, and fell in love with Will & Lake.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really did like this book. I read it in three days and was thoroughly entertained the whole time. Great characters, great plot, kept me wanting to know what would happen next. I love love stories and I was rooting for this couple the whole time!<br /><br />My only complaint was the style of writing. After reading Game of Thrones and Count of Monte Cristo it is hard to go back to the basic, more elementary style of writing. But once I was into the book I forgot about her writing style.<br /><br />Worth the purchase. Nice summer read.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love the site but I've only had the app for a day and I'm already having server issues. Once they fix that it will work well. Too many people are using it for the amount of space they have.<br />You can choose the board to pin on it's right under the image just click on the board  they shows up and your options will appear. it's easy.
B00005LELD|4.0|What can I say much about a lens hood? This one works well and can fold down when not in use and gives good protection. Would have liked it if the price was a little lower than what it costed me.
0316123587|5.0|I bought this Glee book for my granddaughter. It was a great price and so was the shipping! When she came to my home I gave it to her and we both looked it over and read the great titles and words these kids were saying! I laughed my foolish head off! Allikatt, age 16 just beamed with smiles and she cherishes this gift so much! It is well worth the time to order it and the price was super!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I bought few of the new version rear caps. They fit really nice on any Nikon mount lenses. When you use the rear cap you can feel that snug fit which was not the case with other rear caps used.
B00005O5CM|2.0|The shipping and handling time was reasonable. The price was not bad to be a \\"brand new\\" movie, however,  the audio is very poor. I had to turn my tv's volume up really high and still the audio wasn't good. Also, throughout the whole movie, the audio randomly goes on and off completely, this happens constantly.
B000816TCY|4.0|I don't take risk with non OEM batteries. I used it for my nikon P&S and the batteries work like a charm.
B0034G4P80|3.0|Overall, there's a lot of action in this movie, some great visual effects, but seriously lacking in the story department (development) and characterization.<br />The story follows a comic book character (which I haven't read) Thor as he has some disagreements with his father (the King) on leadership styles, gets exiled to Earth, meets a girl, finds out his brother is a bad dude, and ends up saving Earth and his world from certain doom.  Well, that's kind of the story, generally.<br />First, the issues I had with this. The main character, Thor, wasn't all that interesting. He didn't hook me, interest me, intrigue me with who he was, what he was about and what he wanted. Main characters and villains are critical in the story. I think the villain was slightly better developed than Thor.<br />The world he came from, was just plain hokey, the way they portrayed it. It came across ver unrealisitc (all the armor was too perfectly shiny, the capes were unnecessary). It didn't feel real to me.  Fine if you want to take me to another world. Ok. But you have to make that world \\"real\\" to the audience. If we don't \\"buy in\\" to the world, it's going to be hard to sell the story and characters.<br />The subplot love story was really pointless. I'm not convinced it added anything to the story, or the characters. It felt more like a high school crush to me.<br />I still don't get what the bad brother was trying to do. It didn't made sense to me. Not very well developed either (not sure if that's bad writing on the comic book series, or bad writing on the script or both).<br />The good things, I did like some of the visuals, and some of the directing was nice. Obviously they spent some money with VFX.<br />It would have been great if they had put equally the amount of effort in the story and character development.<br />If you're looking for an action movie, don't care much about story, this might be the perfect movie to watch. I was left wanting more, than it delievered.<br />I would not buy this for my collection.not buy this for my collection.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am truly astounded by how this app has helped me sleep. I am a true insomniac am so sleep deprived. I select the cavern rain and wind and I'm gone within minutes. Usually when I wake up during the night its over and I'm up but using this app I go right back to sleep. Awesome!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love this movie! I love every single minute of it!! I make this statement because it is the truth. PRINCESS MONONOKE is absolutely the best film of 1999. Technically, it is a 1997 movie, but it was released in the U.S. two years later as part of the contract between Disney and Studio Ghibli. I missed the opportunity to catch it in theaters back in 99, but I got the chance to see it a year later on DVD.    All I knew at that time was that it was made by Hayao Miyazaki, who had only two previous films released in the U.S.: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. I heard stories about how his work is an inspiration to animators at both Disney and Pixar, and that he was a mentor to John Lasseter. I knew nothing about the story or the characters, and that was an advantage in this kind of a film.    I'll try not to reveal too much about the story. Set in ancient time when forests were ruled by gods, mankind has been doing terrible damage to the forests and have been angering the gods. When a boar god becomes a murderous demon and attacks a village a young boy named Ashitaka successfully defeats the demon, but at a terrible price. His right arm comes in contact with the demon and he is inflicted with a curse that will eventually kill him. He is the last of his tribe, and is told by the village's wise  woman to go on a journey to find a cure. Cutting his hair, he sets off on his journey, vowing to see the world without hate.    Ashitaka saves the life of two men  who live and work in a village known as Iron Town. The town is ruled by a woman named Lady Eboshi. Her people have been cutting down trees in order to manufacture Iron, and have been fighting with the gods with deadly weapons. A human girl named San who was raised by a wolf god has vowed to kill Lady Eboshi and has a deep hatred for all humans, including Ashitaka when he gets in the way of an attack she makes on Eboshi.    If this story seems rather oversimplified to you, believe me, it is not. In reality, there isn't really any clear line about who is good and who is evil in this film. Lady Eboshi isn't an evil character. She is a woman with some flawed motivation. She is actually seen as a good person to the people of Iron Town--someone who rescued young prostitutes and given them a much better working and living environment. Another character is Jigon: a man who is simply out to make money.    What Miyazaki demonstrates in this movie is that he creates characters that get your attention, and images that are just plain astonishing. He personally draws thousands of frames himself, which is something that most animation directors don't do. With PRINCESS MONONOKE, he does something that very few films, animated or not, are able to accomplish for me. He makes me forget that I'm watching a movie, and makes it feel like I'm actually in this movie. It's like an out of the body experience.    I cannot describe these amazing and really beautiful images that PRINCESS MONONOKE gives us. But I can reveal two things.  Many times during the movie there are scenes where you hear absolutely nothing on the soundtrack: no music, no dialogue, no special effects. The image will actually stop for several seconds, without any camera movement. Quiet scenes like this are so rare these days, especially in animated films. Miyazaki understands that not every scene has to have constant movement or quick cutting, like in most Hollywood action movies. PRINCESS MONONOKE does have several action scenes in it, but it is action that you can actually care about.    The other thing I can tell you about is the ending. There is a romance in the movie, but this isn't a romance where the hero gets the girl. It is actually one where the hero doesn't get the girl YET! Two of the characters love each other, but they understand that they cannot live together. When this movie ended, I had the sense that a real romance would actually come between them, but it would simply take time. How many movies, animatedor not, have the courage to end that way?    There is another element in this wonderful movie. The music is by Miyazaki's longtime composer: Joe Hisashi. He has created a beautiful and mesmerizing score for this movie. It adds to the emotional power of the story and images, something so very few movies are able to accomplish.    PRINCESS MONONOKE was the film that sparked my interest in Hayao Miyazaki, and I currently own all of his movies on DVD. It also got me interested in other Japanese Anime. What the Japanese understand is that animation does not have to be pigeonholed as entertainment for children. PRINCESS MONONOKE has scenes that are dark and violent. It is rated PG-13, and I consider that rating appropriate. If there are still some children over 13 who still have the childlike wonder in them and haven't lost it due to the cinematic ADD that too many Hollywood movies generate, PRINCESS MONONOKE will be a real treasure.    The great filmmaker Howard Hawkes had a formula for defining a great movie: \\"Three great scenes, no bad scenes.\\" Multiply that by three and you get PRINCESS MONONOKE.    note: Hayao Miyazaki made the best film for children that I've ever found: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. This should be the very first film children see in their lifetimes. If this review has sparked an interest in Miyazaki for you I also recommend a wonderful book about this man: HAYAO MIYAZAKI, MASTER OF JAPANESE ANIMATION by Helen McCarthy, which is available here at Amazon.com    UPDATE, 2015: PRINCESS MONONOKE has, at long last, been released on blu-ray. The best movie of 1999 just got better!!!!!! This blu-ray is absolutely gorgeous. And the new DTS 5.1 sound is just plain wonderful.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Like when my fav. show isn't on or when your on a VERY long trip. (: I'm up at maybe 4 a.m. wondering what I should do and I just go in my moms room and play this game while shes sleeping ... I told you this game was fun.  ;)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I decided to \\"chance it\\" and purchase based on customers reviews only.<br />Happy I did!<br />Looking forward to more books in the series.
B008YYCK8O|5.0|This is a great episode, whereby the writers keep us guessing once again.  Wonderful to see Donna back.  Do not like the fact that Mike's grandmother passed away.  WOW!  She is a fantastic actress, and love her wit; she'll be missed on the show.  I'm not feeling good about the fact that Jessica probably won't remain Managing Partner, as Lewis doesn't vote for her.  Thus, there is only one episode left, and we already saw the previews, so not enough time to fix this.  I know that Hardman had it planned to promote Lewis, thereby guaranteeing his vote.  Not sure I trust Hardman.  It seems he is repaying Jessica and Harvey back for what they did to him 5 years ago.  I can't imagine Hardman being on top at the firm, there are too many people who don't like him, and I certainly would like Harvey and Jessica to keep winning, but would like to see them befriend Lewis, all stick together and fight to get Hardman out.  If not, there is going to be a constant battle between all three, Jessica, Harvey, and Hardman.  You writers are so cruel to keep us in anticipation for such a long time..........LOVE THIS SHOW!!!  KEEP IT COMING!!!<br /><br />Josey Newman, Atlanta, GA
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this is an awesome read for all ages and it is told so well you dont want to put tye book down, recomended for everyone

B0019IMVDG|5.0|Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) has a mind for math and he is a bookmaker wizard.  He is sent to Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino for the mob.  Within a short period of time the profits are doubled and the mafia keeps two sets of books to hide the money from the federal tax authorities.  The mafia sees a real cash maker in Sam and they send out Nicholas Santoro to protect Sam and the casino from any problems. Nicki is not to smart and a real thug and he is quickly banned from every casino in town.  That leads him and his crew into more strong arm crime and robberies. He is a real out of control gangster.<br /><br />Sam meanwhile falls in love with the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and they are soon married.  For multiple reasons Nicki and Sam are at each other's throats and Sam is also in trouble with the casino commissioner for firing one of his family members.  All of this action leads to more violence, betrayal and conflict......<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with an all-star cast and it is directed by Martin Scorsese who is simply one the best directors of Hollywood history.  The result is a fiery and action filled movie that depicts the history of the Las Vegas Casinos and the mafia control of gambling.  The story line is very good and with such a great cast of actors the movie just seems realistic.  There is a lot of violence and language, it is the mob after all, but it is still a very good movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to you.
1451627289|4.0|This book is not so much about the assassination of our 35th president as it is about the journey of a man from New England to Texas and the love that he found there. King, not my favorite writer, not a great writer (in my opinion), but a master craftsman of story, creates a fascinating premise and then spends the next 800 pages or so playing it out. It DOES get a bit long and drawn out (but never boring) mostly because you want him to get to the assassination part. But he has his reasons for approaching the story the way he does and when you get to the end of the book you will understand, you will smile and yes, you will cry.<br /><br />King made me cry at the end of \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and damn him if he didn't make me do it again with this book.<br /><br />Perhaps he's a greater writer than I give him credit for.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This is a cute game for kids to play. It is fun to play even without making purchases using real money.
B003UESJEM|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining, and the cast is top notch.  The story is all too real with the tough economy the U.S.A. has been going through.  Having seen it now, the pace of the story seems odd.  There is so much time spent setting up the story and introducing the characters, that the end seems somewhat rushed and they tried to tie it up in a neat little bow and that just didn't work for me.  I expected a little more substance after seeing the trailer.<br /><br />It's about corporate downsizing, loyalty, family and friends.  The story is compelling but doesn't quite go anywhere.  They could have rewritten the last 30-40 minutes and answered lots of questions that are just left hanging.  If the price is right, get it.  I did like it.  Just don't pay top dollar for it.  It is a little flawed.  The cast can make up for some of that however.  They are great.  One thumb up!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This was the first book I've read in many years since having twins and having no time to spare but I have the reading bug again. I totally loved the trilogy and really didn't want the story to finish. It's taken some time to actually get my head away from the characters and back into my 'real' life.<br />I highly recommend anyone to read these books I doubt you would be disappointed.....
030758836X|1.0|What a bloody waste of my precious time reading this rubbish..<br />Back to only reading British/Irish writers..<br />Don't waste your time and dosh as I did!

0802798225|4.0|Brittany Ellis and Alex Fuentes could not be more different.  She's the golden girl of the school and he's a feared gang member.  But, when they are forced into being chemistry partners, they discover they're a lot more alike than anyone could've imagined.  I liked the style of having the story narrated alternately by Alex and Brittany.  It make both characters very real.  A very sweet teenage romance.
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|This cd was purported to be one of the best live recordings of the bowie/ronson spiders from mars early 70's recordings. it is!

B00881VLCE|5.0|Love this game)!!!! I give it 7 stars!!! My kids love this!!!  They play all night long. Y<br />ou can make it more challenging by iNcreasing the number of prices you want.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This may not be the album people expected, but what an amazing album. A thousand suns is still better, but living things is the perfect follow-up to A Thousand Suns. Chester sounds amazing as usual. Fans will love that Mike Shinoda is heavily involved in this album with his rapping and singing. For the first time fans will hear Brad get a solo part on this album. LP Fans will appreciate the amazing effort on this album.<br /><br />LOST IN THE ECHO-MIKE'S RAPPING IS GREAT ON THIS SONG WITH AN GREAT VOCAL PIECE FROM CHESTER. THE BEAT IS SO WELL DONE AND WILL HAVE LP FANS HAPPY WITH THIS SONG AS A GREAT LEADOFF TRACK.<br />IN MY REMAINS-THIS SONG SHOWS OFF BRAD'S ALWAYS AMAZING GUITAR ABILITY IN THIS SONG.<br />BURN IT DOWN-THE MOST HYPNOTIZING SONG ON THE ALBUM. THE BEAT IS AWESOME, WITH A SMALL RAP FROM SHINODA. PERFECT SINGLE FOR THIS ALBUM.<br />LIES GREED MISERY-THIS SONG IS VERY INTOXICATING. CHESTER SHOWS OFF THAT LEGENDARY SCREAM OF HIS, AND MIKE KILLS IT ON THIS TRACK.<br />UNTIL IT BREAKS-THIS SONG IS MADE BY SHINODA'S AMAZING RAPPING ABILITY. CHESTER'S BRIDGE IS POWERFUL, AND BRAD'S VOCALS SURPRISES BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT VOICE DURING THIS SONG.<br /><br />These are the definite stand out songs on the album. You will be repeating songs over and over until they are stuck inside your head.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Loved this picture.  Perfect example of how a child, a kid, can worm his way into your heart for evermore!! Hugh Grant is at his best in this one and the boy actor is great. A touching scene is when Hugh Grant comes out on the stage and \\"rescues the boy\\" from certain boos to cheers.  Shirley

B007PTJOV0|4.0|It's one of the best free platformer games I've found for the Kindle Fire. Decent graphics, easy to use controls.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|My wife and I both enjoy cartoon movies, but we don't always like every single one.  This particular one was semi entertaining, but we honestly grew a bit bored with it and figured after the fact that it was a good one time watch, but probably wouldn't own it or watch it again.<br /><br />However, if you have kids, there is plenty of entertainment value for them in it...my wife and I ourselves just couldn't get into it as much as say movies like Up, Finding Nemo, etc.  If you're a person that likes animated movies, I'd still say give it a watch because it may yet be something you yourself would like, and if you have kids, they would probably like it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is just a terrible book, I can't understand the fuss or popularity. It reads like a cheap romance novel, and not even a good one at that. It's repetition bores the reader from the first chapter. I kept reading just to get the meat, thinking there must be a reason for all the hype. It never materialized. I mercifully skimmed over most of it but through the entire trilogy, this book does not deliver. Don't waste your time or money. It's a crime that the kindle version is so expensive.<br /><br />Money and time wasted!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it!! the only think I dislike is sometimes it will skip. other than that it is great! download now!!
B007549W62|1.0|I feel that this movie is very DISTURBING! And if you want to have anxiety and feel depressed, then this movie is for you! It's very graphic and eerie! It just shows how people who don't have any faith in God whatsoever would behave during an apocalyptic event!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|get it now! there is nothing wrong with this app. don't even get the full version. you have soo many levels to pass on this version.
B008FOB124|5.0|My copy of the new CD happen to arrive the day I was going to see DCD in concert. I listened to the CD and loved it, they still have the sound that made them famous. Both Brendan and Lisa have kept their awesome voices. It has 1996 when their last album came out and this new album was worth waiting for. After hearing them live and on CD, I have to say the concert was even better. If your a longtime fan I think you will love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|this app rocks!!! get it now!!! it is very fun!!!! you can unlock so many cool blades and backgrounds! you don't want to stop playing. you get so used to playing it that you don't want to stop until you unlock everything.

B002ZG999U|5.0|For me \\"The Expendables\\" was like a huge comic book, the humor was great just a thoroughly enjoyable movie if you like adventure movies this is one I would recommend.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|I was very happy with this cd.  I bought the cd because I saw him play and sing on TV.  I also play the guitar and I wanted to learn some of his music.  Yes, very happy!
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|One of the problems I find in reviews about music, is that people pattern their reviews based on their taste, rather than the music itself.<br /><br />This is Steve Vai's brilliance. This album is absolutely remarkable. The music is pristine. The way he crafts the sounds is absolutely amazing to me. He is a true master of the art of playing his instrument and recording every sound he can squeeze out of it.<br /><br />Do I like all the songs? No, I don't. Does that make them any less spectacular? No, it doesn't. The creativity involved in crafting this album is jaw dropping.<br /><br />I, too, only like a handful of the songs on the album and don't quite appreciate the non instrumental tracks, but that's my taste, and not a reflection of the actual music itself.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Vai. Another masterpiece.
1594135851|2.0|The books in this series are very good, but you probably have your own opinion by now.<br />I'm writing this review to point out that the only paperback version listed is large print, which is weird, and it's easy to miss that they're large print from the way it's listed.  Watch out for this, it's annoying.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.<br /><br />It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does exactly what it says and is exactly what I was looking for.  I use it on my Nexus 7 tablet.  I like how you can set different alarms.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. For some reason I've put off reading it for years, and now that I've read it, I wonder why. It was a delightful tale of the joy that Christmas can bring to our lives. Scrooge is well depicted as a grumpy individual, but the transformation that the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future bring about will warm any heart. I'd recommend this book to any and every reading person!
B008MM9630|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Super cute and addictive. It's a great way to pass time. Always have things to do so it doesn't get boring.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I feel woefully inadequate to reviewing this book, as it is one of the great classics, and there's been so much said about it already down the years.<br /><br />My thoughts on reading it (apart from that it's a good book, and very vividly written) were that Emily carries out a very good analysis of what \\"heaven\\" or \\"hell\\" may mean to different people - that one person's \\"hell\\" may be different to another's. I have not read any studies on the book, so I don't know even if this is meant to be one of the themes, but that was my impression.<br /><br />I would definitely read this book again one day.
B00634GHJA|5.0|love this app, but need room on my phone..  please fix to allow option of moving app to sd card..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There's some poor controls but, its fun.<br />People say its bad its not the worst I play it sometimes on my moms kindle to she has so much games that she unlocked and I love them so I'm going to download the app back.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In order to really appreciate and fully comprehend the depth of this book you must read the entire trilogy, all three books.  These books provide hope on so many levels while showing what life and relationships can be about.  They are erotic, suspenful, mysterious, and very addicting... The author paints very clear pictures to the point where you can actually visualize the scene and feel as though you really know the characters.  A must read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like that the calculator fills the whole screen and is easy to read. So often apps like these are so small that it defeats the purpose of having it on your device. Thanks!
B000GAWH28|5.0|I purchased volume one of this package as a companion to volume 2, which I had obtained many years ago.  I finally made the time to begin reviewing the works of Shakespeare and was happy to find this set still available.  For my entry level use, it is complete and well put together.

B008220AVW|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to buy this movie. Even if you don't like her as much or at all you will definately love this movie and will start to feel love for her. Her movie opens up to her fans. It is very inspirational,touching, and fun. She teaches us life lessons on experiences/mistakes that she has made herself. Katy Perry is an amazing talented person who once had a dream come true. Anyone young and old will love this movie so much.
B007RTAR64|4.0|This was very cute and I didnt open it because I love to collect movie dolls but I am only upset because where is Peeta????????? You cant put out one without the other!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is fun, challenging, and will easily kill the time. Runs beautifully on the Kindle Fire. It is worth the 99&cent; that is charged and Where's My Water is just as good!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book started off good.  Kept me interested.  The characters of Amy and Nick were written to be complicated and they were.  But, then it drifted into a direction of disbelief.  I found myself saying, what are you kidding me.  The Amy and Desi relationship was too far fetched, as was the investigation.  I wanted to rate this book higher and was looking forward to doing so as I was reading it.  But the ending, well it took what might have a 4 star to a 2 star. I can't say I hated it, cause I did enjoy the first part, but then it spiraled out of control, and lost all sense of being a well written novel. The ending was a let down and we as a reader and a consumer of this book deserved better.  Can honestly say, my Kindle will not be downloading any more of Ms.Flynn's books.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|So many good tracks in this.  Not overbearing. They serve to enhance the picture.<br /><br />Some favourites include A Planet, Going in, Life, Dazed, Space Jockey, Collision, and Debris.<br />You will have to see the film to truly appreciate the way these tracks are used, giving each of their settings a highly surreal and atmospheric feel.  No surprise from the Master Ridley Scott.
B007PVHANM|4.0|While I have no complaint with the quality of this film, I do object to the cheap, flimsy \\"recyclable\\" snapcase.  I hope this isn't a trend.  The plastic leaves a permanent indentaion if you grab it firmly; in fact the case strikes me as having little more substance than CD shrinkwrap.
145162607X|5.0|Maybe I've been living under a rock.  I was familiar with Philippa Gregory's work, I was aware of her reputation as a writer, and yet... I had not picked up one of her books until now.  I also don't have much knowledge of this period in history, so The Kingmaker's Daughter may as well have been a work of pure fiction to me.  At least one reviewer mentioned that the events in this book overlapped with events in some of Gregory's earlier works, but in reading as a \\"newbie,\\" every page was filled with suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />Anne Neville was born to a family of great wealth and power, with a father known as \\"The Kingmaker.\\"  With only two daughters, Anne and Isabel, Richard's ambitions lie in securing powerful marriages for his daughters.  He is intent on making one of the girls a queen.  Richard has little interest in the girls aside from as pawns in his schemes, and his actions continually put their lives at risk, as well as his own.<br /><br />While this novel has kings and queens and dukes and duchesses, the most interesting relationship was between Anne and her older sister, Isabel.  The girls had a complex relationship; their sisterly love was oftentimes overcome by competitiveness and mistrust, as others manipulated them and maneuvered them around the chessboard.  As they grew older, their bond was tested more severely.<br /><br />Gregory writes with such richness and intelligence.  I was hooked from around page 20.  Since this was a new story to me, a heavy dose of suspense remained throughout as I viewed nearly every character with suspicion, wondering how he or she would betray Anne. I grew to care for Anne as she matured from a young girl under her parents' control and protection to a young woman who must use her wits to survive.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app for relaxation &amp; meditation. It's worth upgrading from the free version. Glad I found it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I tell you what, my wife is the one who got me started playing this game. One night she asked me to check on something she was cooking. Well that's all it took. Joking aside the game is fun and entertaining and I am a 40 year old man.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|I can tell that anyone under the age of 62 will have a hard time with the concepts in this movie & won't be \\"gettin' it\\"... I am 68 years young and this was a pick-me-up & throw me back to the good ol' days in downtown San Francisco and the \\"Summer of Love\\" 1968. Loved this movie!!! Man... everyone needs to \\"chill out\\" and enjoy the \\"scene\\" and \\"get down with it\\". Seeing Alan Alda was a treat...he has never lost the \\"touch\\"... he played a pivotal role in the film, and always makes me laugh. Jennifer was slightly out of character but, was great as someone having a complete \\"change of life\\" moment. Paul Judd seemed to fit well in the \\"soup\\" of the cast, seemed a bit stiff...but mostly was his character. I have seem some of the reviews panning this movie... wow... do we have a bunch of people out there that are so \\"PC\\" they can't even enjoy a good romp once in awhile??? This movie represents a moment in time when we should stop and consider life, friendships, relationships, and just being able to have fun!! It seems that most people today have totally forgotten how to do just that.....sad scene folks...So get this film and put aside any expectations; just relax and enjoy.. I highly recommend this movie!!

B0084IG7KC|5.0|One of the best movies of the year by far, this film is a genuine masterpiece and exceeded all my expectations. Originally i believed it to be another twilight clone, bloodless with little emotion, but i was pleasantly surprised, the film offers extraordinary acting and directing. the action was well paced and the main star Jennifer Lawrence was a strong female lead who played Katniss perfectly. every actor was well cast. Act 1 is placed in the capital and with the training of the 24 tributes leading to act 2 with the hunger games which is with adrenaline fueled intensity leads to a satisfying climax. Im definately in for the second installment.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love these books!! I'm actually about to reread all of them! I could barely put them down! Amazing books!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book.

B002FL5HYQ|4.0|If you're considering reading a Trump book, there is no doubt you know he is successful. Likely, you also know that he has an ego the size of Trump Tower. Well then, who better to write a book called \\"Think Big and Kick Ass\\"? Trump's personality comes through boldly in the book. Sometimes it is humorous and motivating, other times it can be a little much and get off-topic slightly.<br /><br />The book is co-written with Bill Zanker, founder of The Learning Annex, an online channel for self improvement. Bill's commentary are at the end of each chapter and are only a couple pages per chapter. What this adds to the book is another point of view for each of Donald's major points.<br /><br />The book is broken down into 10 chapters, with a summary of Key Points at the end of each chapter, which I think is very helpful when you want a little refresher. There is also a list of books for recommended reading in the Appendix and a Q&A of common questions Trump has received during speeches with the Learning Annex.<br /><br />Alas, here are the chapters and my commentary on each one:<br /><br />1. Do You Have What It Takes?<br />Can you really dream big? If so, there is a multiple-choice test in this chapter to self-assess. This sets the tone for the book. If you don't want to be super successful and aren't willing to bust your hump to get there, don't continue reading.<br /><br />2. Passion, Passion, Passion!<br />Do what you love. For Trump, it is real estate and making deals. Maybe for you it is teaching others or baking. Just start doing what makes you happy and take action every day to get bigger and better.<br /><br />3. Basic Instincts<br />Go with your instinct, using all knowledge that you have.<br /><br />4. Creating Luck<br />I was actually surprised that Trump acknowledged and made some thoughtful points regarding luck. Some people do get lucky and some people get tough times. However, he rightfully tells you to avoid thinking of the world in only these terms. Create your own luck by working hard and putting yourself in the best situations. Mind over matter. Action over standing still.<br /><br />5. Fear Factor<br />What I wanted to be my favorite chapter turned out to be my least favorite. He went a little too far off topic on this one. My only takeaway was to realize that people want to go after the #1 and replace them. That means on your way to the top people will try to knock you off and once you get there, you have a target on your back. Essentially, be on the lookout and be aggressive, and don't let others dissuade you.<br /><br />6. Revenge<br />Funniest chapter by far. To quote Donald's summary: \\"When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.\\"<br /><br />7. Big Mo!<br />An object in motion tends to stay in motion. Get going! And once you do, keep the momentum and don't rest on your laurels.<br /><br />8. Never Take Your Eye Off The Ball<br />A continuation in thought from the previous chapter. Keep your focus.<br /><br />9. I Love You, Sign This<br />Get a prenup. No exceptions. There is no room for error or doubt in the back of your mind about future of the business you are building.<br /><br />10. Thing Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life<br />This is the \\"bring it all together\\", high-level chapter. If you're familiar with the movie Boiler Room, act \\"as if\\". Live the life you think a successful person would live and put yourself in the situations and environments that a successful person would. To a good degree, I like what he is saying. Although I would argue that one shouldn't be irresponsible by living too far beyond their means if they have to support others.<br /><br />Here's what I think: if you need a little motivation and like the lifestyle of the Donald, you'll probably like this book. I would recommend borrowing from a friend or from the library (that's what I did) to determine whether or not this is a book that you need to buy to keep on your shelf. If you've read books from Napoleon Hill and DavidSchwartz, you might skip this one and start taking action on your goals instead.
B0086700CM|4.0|so temple run is very addicting but I only gave it 4 stars because turning your device side to side to get coins on the kindle fire kind of screws you up but other than that its a great game!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There are definitely some high points to this book, and well, there are a few down sides to this book.  The book is read as a narrative with the main character, Ana, as the very young, but intellegent, soon to be graduate of a colllege degree. In the beginning you can be easily swept away by the author's ability to have you feel as though the character has an unbelieveable ability to be truly in the moment and depict her surroundings as well as the actions and emotions of herself and other characters, it begins to get annoying as the descriptions and the main character's explainations of how \\"his lip twitched\\" and his \\"unkept hair moved\\" become repetitive and predictable.<br />The language went back and forth from being what sounded like conversations from a young girl in her early twenties with occassional wiffs of naivete, to conversations that she would have with herself or with the other main character, Christian aka \\"Fifty Shades\\", that consisted of a much larger vocabulary and sudden spurts of knowledge only gained by someone twice her age..<br />It also left me feeling a bit let down, however, I do like that  the author is able to draw you in, but sadly on to many occasions youre drawn in and you feel as though you are waiting for something, anything to occur and nothing really does. She was able to draw me in, I was wanting to root for the smart, beautiful girl, but then youre constantly reminded of how she apparently has no clue she's beautiful and apparently never really looks in the mirrors she describes. So I'm not sure if its intentional, if the author wants you to \\"grow up\\" (ie: life experiences, self-esteem, independence or dependence) with the character,  or if its just a character that isnt planned well.<br />Without giving away to much, the beginning of the book builds up the characters and the last half feels as though you are watching a marriage struggle, which left me wondering what did I miss, and how can she go from being so innocent, yet so smart, to so naive, to being overly forgiving and accepting of this person she's only known for a couple of weeks....<br /><br />So in a nut shell, without giving my opinion about everypage - It is a fun read, its definitely not a book youre going to buy if your looking for something intellectually stimulating, in fact it is quite the contrary, stimulating-yes.  Can be a bit repetitive at times. I'm a huge fan of trilogies, so yes I have read all three books. And as I said, its a fun read! I dont think it should be sold to minors (wait til you get to the 3rd book of the trilogy....)
B005FISBTO|3.0|No subtitles - really? And having to sit through ads for Showtime on each disc without being able to skip them is annoying as he!!. Major thumbs down to Showtime. The 6th Season however is still classic Dexter with some new twists (Religion) tossed in. But even as good as it is the lack of subtitles is a stupid move by Showtime and those ads! Ugh!

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, in some ways, reminds me of that Twilight Zone episode, \\"The Trouble With Templeton,\\" in which an aging stage actor, nostalgic for his youth, ends up traveling to his past. Like that episode, there are wistful elements that suffuse this film's narrative. Our rear view mirror tends to be rose-tinted, isn't it? Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) and his fianc&eacute;e Inez (Rachel McAdams) are holidaying in Paris, sort of mooching off Inez's parents who are there on a business trip. Gil, a self-confessed hack scriptwriter who's raring to write his great American novel, is enamoured with La Ville-Lumi&egrave;re, the City of Light. On and on he goes regaling a couldn't care less Inez with anecdotes concerning the literary luminaries who populated Paris back in the day. Inez's eyes are gone all glazed. She'd rather go shopping. So, from jump, the dynamics of their relationship set off our uh-oh radar. And yet MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is touted partly as a frothy romantic comedy.<br /><br />It's written and directed by Woody Allen, and you know what you're getting with that name brand. Clever words, a touch of satire, a slice of whimsy, and a neurosis or two. I hear Owen Wilson delivering his dialogue, his verbal tics and cadence, and I picture Woody Allen mouthing along those same lines. I didn't like Wilson's character initially; he seemed a little pushy and opinionated. But then along comes Gil's fianc&eacute;e's old crush, a gent who is so pedantic and know-it-all that Gil, next to him, immediately becomes more sympathetic. After one evening of wine tasting, Mr. Pedantic extends an invitation to Gil and Inez to step out and go dancing; Inez accepts and Gil declines. Gil instead opts for a midnight stroll. And when he gets lost and sits on the steps of that old church, along sidles an old classic Peugeot packed with revelers who wave Gil on over. A bemused Gil gets in the Peugeot and off they motor to the swinging 1920s.<br /><br />No explanation at all for the time travel. Woody Allen expects us to just roll with it, and I was cool with that. In the dizzy era of jazz and flappers, a flabbergasted Gil bumps into one literary icon after another, from F. Scott Fitzgerald (and his wild wife Zelda) to Ernest Hemingway to Gertrude Stein (warmly played by Kathy Bates). And maybe the high point of Gil's evening takes place in Gertrude Stein's salon when she offers to proofread his manuscript.<br /><br />Meanwhile, life in the present day keeps on keeping on. Except that now Gil's fianc&eacute;e and her parents have taken to wondering where Gil disappears to when evening swings around. The future pops-in-law even sics a private detective to shadow him (the gumshoe's eventual fate may elicit a grin). In the roaring '20s, after each midnight, Gil keeps running into famous and interesting folks (including Adrien Brody's entertainingly manic Salvador Dali). And, in the past, Gil meets the exquisite Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who once was mistress to Braque and Modigliani and is currently Picasso's lover. Surprisingly, sparks fly between her and Gil. And I did mention \\"frothy romantic comedy,\\" didn't I?<br /><br />Every now and then a Woody Allen film muddles that line separating fantasy and reality. Two of my favorite Woody Allen films are [[ASIN:0792846117 Sleeper]] and [[ASIN:B00005O06L The Purple Rose of Cairo]], with MIDNIGHT IN PARIS perhaps elbowing in and inching up in my personal rankings. I love this premise; I love time travel. Paris looks exquisite, day or night. Woody Allen fabricates grace and wit and romance, not just of the heart but of an era. The ensemble cast is fantastic. Marion Cotillard is enchanting and luminous (but when is she not?). Owen Wilson's character exhibits such enthusiasm over the Who's Who of Paris circa 1920s that he becomes just irrepressible. Note that Woody isn't going for out-and-out authenticity with his depiction of the historical figures. He's having too good a time exaggerating a trait, tweakinga characteristic. I chuckled at Papa Hemingway's tendency to relate everything to one's masculinity and virility. I enjoyed Gil's befuddling of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. I will say that you'll get more out of this film if you're familiar with even a few of the larger than life personalities Gil meets in the past. But if you were in the dark with some of these folks - as I was, occasionally - well, I say this: to the wiki!<br /><br />The DVD's bonus feature:<br /><br />- \\"Midnight in Cannes\\" - at the MIDNIGHT IN PARIS press conference in the Cannes Film Festival, 2011 (00:04:57 minutes)<br />- Theatrical Trailera characteristic.

1593083564|4.0|Mansfield Park is my fourth Jane Austen novel (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Persuasion being the others read).  For two thirds of the story, I thought to myself that Mansfield Park was going to be my favorite Jane Austen novel.  It is longer than the other three novels I have read with various plot lines that kept me interested in what was going to happen next.  But then it seemed to me that Jane Austen decided it was time to bring her long story to an end.  I was uncomfortable with the speed with which she resolved the many problems that had kept the reader wondering how everything would turn out.<br /><br />Fanny Price is our main character and she is much like Cinderella.  Taken at ten years old from her poor home to live with rich relatives, she is given an unheated attic bedroom and then treated as little better than a servant by her adopted family, except for her beloved cousin Edmond who realizes Fanny's true worth.  Eight years later when the main action of the story begins, Fanny is now a beautiful and demure young woman who genuinely cares for her family and friends and serves them as best she can.  She seems almost too good to be true, but from time to time her humanity reveals it self when she shows herself to be a harsh critic who expects others to be perfect, like herself.  Her cousin Edmond is her male counterpart.  The two cousins sit in judgment on the people in their little world who do not live up to their high standards.<br /><br />Fortunately for the reader, the rest of the characters in the novel have faults and failings.  Henry and Mary Crawford are the two foils for Fanny and Edmond and both are living, breathing human beings who do not live up to the high expectations of Fanny and Edmond.  Henry proposes marriage to Fanny and she rejects him utterly.  His proposal itself is an affront to her because she thinks him a shallow flirt.  Edmond wants to propose to Mary, but he thinks she will not accept him because he intends to become a clergyman and he she has contempt for men of the cloth.  These are two major plot lines in the novel and Austen resolves them with dispatch, disposes of other loose ends, and then ends her story.<br /><br />Critics rate Jane Austen at the top of the list of great English novelists.  She continues to be read and admired and many films have been made of her work.  Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth as D'Arcy is the best of them, in my opinion, and Mansfield Park, with Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price, takes so many liberties with the original story that most Jane Austen fans will resent this retelling of the novel.<br /><br />Each of us has our own favorites when it comes to English novelists and I must confess that Anthony Trollope and Charles Dickens are at the top of my list.  That said, I agree with the critics that Jane Austen's work continues to deserve an audience and I recommend Mansfield Park as representative of her work.become a clergyman and he she has contempt for men of the cloth.

0307592731|1.0|I stopped reading this book less than half way through it. From what im reading in reviews on Amazon i did myself a favor. Ms. Strayed definitely has some daddy issues that need about $10,000 in professional help that no amount of walking the PCT could possibly cure. Reminds me of a few crazy ex-girlfriends i had, except those girlfriends outgrew their drug induced, self absorbed, and feelings of self loathing that they tried to find answers for through actions of severe depravity by the time they were 20.<br />People who have never been on a trail will be mystified by the BS. People who have will see right through it. A book about hiking the PCT where someone didnt even complete half of it, at least A Walk in the Woods was funny and did the trail justice by describing it with dignity and respect, things devoid in his book as well as in Ms. Strayers own life. If you pick up this book planning to hike the trail yourself and using it as a reference you are putting your life in danger. The only resounding theme in this book is that if life throws you a curve ball, its time to quit. Ms strayer is still lost, the PCT(and all of the other long trails) teach and change those who want to be changed.<br />A disgrace to hikings long history of love and life. Sickening.

B006LSZECO|5.0|First, the negative. I thought the plot slid off the rails a bit at the end. Although it had a strong sense of inevitability, it was somewhat over the top and became repetitious in the last 30 pages or so. But that doesn't mean the ending dragged, it just wasn't as strong as the rest of the book.<br /><br />That said, it definitely gets five stars!! Why? 1) I could not put it down (took time off work to read, which I haven't done in a long time ... too long), 2) the writing is brilliant, 3) the characters leap off the page with life -- they are complex and hateful and completely understandable.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Gillian Flynn since Sharp Objects, and Gone Girl did not let me down.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|**This is a review of the Hunger Games 2 disc BD**<br /><br />Hunger Games books - great. The film, almost as good (which is meant as a sure compliment). Every actor was choice perfect. My main problem is the fact that I wanted to watch the next movie RIGHT THEN. Better editing? My next 'gripe' is the special features: while there is a sizable collection, but everyone kept saying the same thing - so and so was amazing // can I compliment some one else more than they have already?<br /><br />So, while I cannot complain about anything, I can find anything that makes it stand out either. Yes, it is an above average presentation. I guess I'll 'finish' the review properly, when the next movie is made. And at the end of the day, this film is perfect for fans.<br /><br />My complaint is minor. Read the books. Enjoy the movie. And we cannot wait to see the next one.

They were well written wonderfully passed and I fell in love with the characters so fast I could never put the books down I had to know what happened; and watching the movie was the exact same way. Even though I knew everything that was going to happen the movie made it so realistic it surprised me every time! My friends and I LOVE this movie and believe me when I say that I was going crazy yesterday (august 17th) because I couldn't wait to see it again and now that I have I can easily say that this is my new favorite movie. It is so incredible, the acting is fantastic, the camera and lighting (in my opinion) are perfect, and it follows the book so well.<br />In the beginning i did not have high hopes for the movie. I was definitely excited but i didn't think it was going to be as amazing as it is. I suggest that you watch this movie, YOUR GOING TO LOVE IT!<br /><br />~Jamaica Perrier~<br /><br />PS: TEAM PEETA!!!! <3

B000FC1MCS|3.0|A quick read. I finished it in three or four hours. The plot provides a peek into the mind and life of an adolescent with autism (Asperger's Syndrome).<br /><br />Mark Haddon is not Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, despite the referential title, but the plot caught my attention, especially when I feared for Christopher's safety and well-being on his nerve-wracking journey into London.  I cared about Chris. And I cared about the mystery of the poor pitchforked dog. But that part of the story fell flat.<br /><br />As one who has worked with a few children with mild autism and has read several books about the topic,  Haddon's portrayal of Christopher struck me as fairly accurate in some respects but yet grossly stereotypical, insulting, ignorant, and diminishing.  More reliable works about autism in the popular press include [[ASIN:0307396185 Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's]], and (even better) [[ASIN:054505690X Marcelo In The Real World]].<br /><br />Another story to help young adults become more aware of individual differences is [[ASIN:0756970202 Al Capone Does My Shirts]], set on the Island of Alcatraz in the time when the gangster was imprisoned and assigned laundry detail. It's fiction, based in some history.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I do a lot of recording on location where portability, and reliability are crucial.  The E5 output may not please self appointed audiophiles (who I think are often more impressed with numbers than sound).  The point is, I need a device that spares the batteries of my super portable recording devices, has enough output to be heard in loud situations, even with open air headphones (Grados), and which deliver a natural sound.  Sure if you press them too hard, they'll break up on you, but not nearly as quickly as the headphone outputs on most portable audio or video devices.  They add virtually no weight or take up no space in my gig bag (which is a small drawback - they are very easy to lose!).  If you intend to use this as a stereophile listening device, there are probably better options.  If you intend to obcessively test this at your shop bench, there are probably much better options.  If you intend to spend $20 on a device that works SPLENDIDLY, this is for you.
B003TTEUQY|5.0|I didn't watch this show when it first came on the air, mainly because I didn't want to get hooked on another show.  But I love medical dramas, so I gave this a shot.  I was hooked from the very first episode, and this show has been consistently great through each season.  I'm glad it was renewed, and I cannot WAIT for the next season!  I'd give this show 10 stars if I could.  I LOVE it!!

B002VHI8FE|3.0|Good book but it had issues.<br /><br />1) The names drove me crazy and broke the flow of reading. There were a bunch of females whose names ended in \\"o\\" and a bunch of males whose names ended in \\"a\\". So maybe that was nit-picky of me... I let it slide--eventually.<br /><br />2) Too many apposition shifts. There were too many characters and the story kept jumping between their points of view. This happened about three times every chapter.<br /><br />3) There were some characters that I didn't like, and those annoying characters received way too much time in the spotlight. It was like listening to someone try and salvage a bad joke.<br /><br />4) Glokta: one of the main characters read too much like torture porn.<br /><br />Good stuff:<br /><br />1) Original story. It was...<br /><br />2) Good writing: the dialog, the descriptions, and the action were all well written.<br /><br />3) Funny, at times<br /><br />4) Unexpected directions: the author never went w/ easy or convenient answers.<br /><br />All in all it was a good book. But the ending sucked.<br /><br />(sorry about the typos this is just a quick and dirty review)
B0016K40KO|5.0|If David Lean's \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" is any indication, it's that characterization and storytelling can be as beautiful as a striking landscape. These days, most Hollywood epics are either big-budget fluff pieces or overstuffed slogs that are rich in visuals and poor in content. \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" is a real epic: epic in themes, settings, characterizations and ideas.<br /><br />\\"Bridge\\", more than many movies of its time and today, is a startling portrait of the madness of war. The movie may be about a captured British unit forced to build a bridge for the Japanese army and that the British Army sends a unit of commandos to sabotage it but it's all a McGuffin to reveal how war and illusions of grandeur profoundly affect the human psyche. Alec Guinness' Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa's Saito, two opposing sides of the coin, both want to build a bridge for different reasons: for Nicholson, it is to show the ingenuity and hard work of British soldiers, despite the fact that it will aid the enemy, even going as far as sending physically damaged soldiers to do the job; for Saito, it is to express Japanese pride or commit harakiri. The bridge, far from symbolizing the human connection, symbolizes the futility of war and how impossible visions and baseless loyalty lead to the disintegration of the human mind.<br /><br />Adding an interesting twist to this story is the character of Shears, superbly played by William Holden. Shears escapes the Japanese base camp and is miraculously rescued, only to be forced by the British army to go back and sabotage the bridge or he will be charged for impersonating the officer. Shears is a soldier trying but failing to escape the horrors of war and that the British army's refusal to heed to his pleas reveals how any country's declaration that a soldier performs his duty to defend his country are a baseless proclamation in the face of reality.<br /><br />Watching \\"Bridge\\" for the first time, one can easily be misled into thinking that the movie is a grand, old-fashioned action-adventure. But the movie is more than just an adventure. Like David Lean's other majestic epic, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", \\"Bridge\\" is a movie filled with ideas, revealed upon multiple viewings by examining the cinematic details, from the encompassing landscapes to the chose of camera angles depicted.<br /><br />Speaking of which, David Lean's command of the cinematography in \\"Bridge\\" is absolutely spectacular. There are, of course, the epic shots like the deep focus shots in the camp where Shears talk about his escape plan with the British unit in the background, the extreme long shots of the commandos scaling the cliffs with Warden limping in the foreground and the shots of the bridge's construction and eventual completion. But its subtle moments are equally memorable, such as the claustrophobic shots of Nicholson in the oven, the full shot of Saito crying after releasing Nicholson and the officers and the concluding montage of Nicholson's realization of \\"what he has done\\" before purposely (or is it accidentally?) destroying the bridge. One of my personal favorite shots in the movie are not even epic shots but a simple low-angle shot of an escaped Shears' head looming over the hot sun, an expression of fatigue and desperation presented from the man's face. Shots like these prove that there was more to Lean's epics than camels and lush romances.<br /><br />Anyone accustomed to the fast-paced, rapidly-edited action movies of Christopher Nolan and Paul Greengrass may be put off by the movie's deliberate pacing but that really works in the movie's favor. It doesn't jump into anything; it takes its time and sets up a chain of events that reaches an emotionally satisfying conclusion. Despite its 160 minute length, \\"Bridge\\" is hardly boring. It is eternal proof that a movie can still rivet an audience without a dozen action scenes linked together.<br /><br />\\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" works on many levels: as a taut action-adventure, as a powerful psychological study of men in a noncombat war situation and as a grand epic with big shots and bigger themes. The two-disc special edition is the DVD/Blu-Ray to get. Watch it and you'll marvel at the skill, ambitions and passion that made \\"Bridge\\" one of the most memorable war movies of the 1950s.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy.aut action-adventure, as a powerful psychological study of men in a noncombat war situation and as a grand epic with big shots and bigger themes.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|The novel is quite funny for those who have enough knowledge of Star Trek and similar TV sci-fi to see the trends of those shows. Good dialog and well paced plot. The codas are not as entertaining though, but are a decent plus to the book. And of course the story is quite predictable after a certain point, if you are reading this book it means you are after exactly that. To quote a character, \\"that is recursive and meta.\\"<br /><br />P.S.: What's up with those editorial reviews? \\"Courtroom showdown in a cathartic finish\\", \\"punch to the stomach\\", \\"blend of offworld adventure and political intrigue\\"? Are these canned phrases randomly picked in reply to a review request? They have nothing to do with this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. My husband is kind of obsessed with it. The only thing that I have a problem with is there are some times when you want him to turn and instead he jumps and ends up diving off the wall. That always makes me mad but it is probably just the way I slid my finger across the screen! Other then that it is hard to put down!

0345803485|1.0|I'll make this short. Don't waste your time. This was not a good book at all and I'm confused as to why it was so popular.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is horribly written.  The scenes and characters lack depth.  There is a lot of lip biting and blushing on the part of Ana.  Grey's eyes are constantly flashing a shade of gray.  Ana the virgin explodes into a million pieces with orgasms twice in the first sex scene.  It's flat out ridiculous.  The sex scenes are not erotic.  They somehow fall flat.  There's so much press about this book and it must be just because of the sex.  It's certainly not because it's a well written novel worthy of becoming a classic in our generation.  It's as though a young girl wrote the book.  Entertainment Weekly said it's \\"in a class by itself.\\"  Thank goodness because it would be appalling to put it on par with any serious author of our day or any other.  Don't waste your money on this!  I am returning it for a refund and I'm just on Chapter 10.  Hopefully I can avoid dropping any more IQ points by not reading further.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is an unusually good movie. It compares well in tone with the original Star Wars film and is comparable in many ways to Avatar from a technical perspective. The four-armed Martians are spectacular. It is unfortunate that the critics, none of whom give any indication that they ever read any of the books, uniformly speak ill of the movie, guaranteeing that there will probably never be a sequel. Although there are some plot changes for the the purposes of telling a story in a sort period of time, the film is faithful to the spirit of the books. All of the main characters are authentically and accurately presented. For those who don't know it, John Carter is a major hero of Edgar Rice Burroughs on the same level as Tarzan. If there had been the technical expertise to present Mars or Barsoom in earlier days of cinema, Carter would probably be a bigger name than Tarzan. The film has inspired people I know to read the books.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I first watched this movie on my computer while all my relatives were sleeping. Bad idea. I was laughing up a storm. This movie is absolutely hilarious. It has very quick & witty, dry humor, as well as some subtleties. All the characters have their own personalities and facial expressions that are funny and quirky. The movie's storyline isn't bad at all either. The voice acting is top-notch and the musical scores are very fitting. I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it on blu-ray the same day. I'm 24 years old and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you have a dry sense of humor, like witty humor, or humor in general, I highly recommend picking up this film.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|The movie was fun and action packed. The audio was amazing and engulfing. The CGI looked extremely realistic on bluray. Can't wait for the next movie (they're making a trilogy, right?).
B00783NWB6|4.0|I'm a fan of the entire UNDERWORLD series.  Can't wait for the next one.  Technically, the 3D imagery and the sound were an easy 9 out of 10. No dropouts, lots of depth.  I would have liked a little more \\"out of the screen and in your face\\" 3D effects.  Kate was GREAT (and gorgeous)as usual.  The story was good. The series reminds me of the cliff-hanger serials in the '40s and 50's but with present day production and acting standards.  I'd like a little more character interaction interspersed with the non-stop action.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Watched on my computer 3 times. A great movie for the ambitious person who may be in a slump. Motivates in a twisted way. What you need is already inside you. Great music too!

0307346617|5.0|I was really impressed by World War Z. It wasn't just about zombies, but what would occur if there were some sort of global epidemic. There were so many carefully thought out stories. In fact, some of them were genius. They were all realistic, but they still had that element of the ridiculous that zombies give books. It was unbelievably creative and I think everyone can find a character they can see themselves being (or wanting to me). It's not too scary or gory for those that shy away from that sort of thing.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased m BK2 from WholesaleHunter but I just had to let Amazon customers know that it is all but impossible to go wrong in purchasing this knife.<br />The blade is a full tang, 1/4\\" wide and sharp as a razor; out of the box.<br />Please note that someone will always find something they don't like about any product. I say that this knife is designed as well as is possible. The grips are hard but so what, it fits the hand very well, I haven't found a blister rub spot yet, including chopping wood. The blade can be ground down flat (oh wait, that'll happen normally over time with normal sharpenings.) Some complain about the sheath; well, it's definitely designed so that the knife will never unknowingly come out of the sheath...ever. It has not dulled my blade as some have mentioned. I will complain about the dang belt loop though, it sucks. Get a belt clip; yeaaaaa...problem fixed. The [[ASIN:B004D6H1WC Mora Classic Number 2.]] makes the perfect accompaniment knife to the BK2.<br />It just came to me that the best way to describe this knife is; The Ka-Bar BK2 is a true woodsman's knife.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works very well. The first app that I found that does it all.  I like the many options that be turned on and off.
B0019IB0II|3.0|I picked up this book because I am an avid reader of the popular science genre, and I had heard glowing reviews. The book is fine, the writing is engaging and emotionally moving. However, the science stops after the first few chapters, and what started out as an engaging and intriguing personal case study in the inner workings of the human mind rapidly turned into one woman's journey of self discovery, and stayed that way for 12 more chapters.<br />Great if you want a moving comeback story of how motherly love overcomes all obstacles, or if you are the friend or family of an individual who suffered a stroke, or a recovering stroke victim yourself.<br />If you wanted something along the lines of an Oliver Sacks book about the peculiarities and intricacies of the human mind, stop after chapter 8.

0446541478|3.0|The book provides - through the use, among others, of (fewer than expected) technology/start-up examples - some interesting insights about Israel's history, development and idiosyncrasy, as well as some of the drivers that have led the country to become what it is today.<br /><br />I found most curious the influence of the mandatory military training in the shaping of the Israeli people's character (in particular the \\"chutzpah\\") and entrepreneurial drive, and their correlation with the creation of the start-up environment and with the way business is conducted.<br /><br />Considering my little knowledge about Israel, the book has been an entertaining way of learning a little more about it. However, I'd note that it is a book focused on Israel as a country rather than on the technology/start-up scene.

0345803485|1.0|I was given the trilogy set as a gift and I read the 1st book.  It doesn't work as a romance novel and it's not good erotica.  It's poorly written with no plot and character development.  The sex scenes are so boring and repetitive that I found myself skipping them.  The best thing about the book is the ending where Ana comes to her senses and leaves him.  Have some self-respect and self-esteem!!!  I cannot believe that this is a best seller!!!  Try \\"Delta of Venus\\" by Anais Nin if you want good erotica.  This is trash and not worth the time or money!!

B008S7EPXA|5.0|It has been a long time since Dead Can Dance released a new album after Both Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry parted ways to follow their own solo careers. And ever since the album Spirit Chaser came out, I have been waiting for them to get their act together one more time and create a new album.<br /><br />I am happy that the wait is finally over and their new efforts are here for us to enjoy. Unfortunately I attempted to purchase this album from Amazon.com the first day it came out and I had lots of problems with the download process. I purchased a couple of other albums at the same time and those downloaded without any hitch, but this album for some reason never did. I got my money back and went to iTunes where I paid more for it, but downloaded it without any problems.<br /><br />After listening to this album, I wish I would have known Dead Can Dance was going on a world tour. For what I hear from my friends who attended their concert at Berkeley, CA, it was quite an experience.<br /><br />Thank you DCD for a wonderful new album!

Anyway, I hope the love scene would be pure and simple, as in the book.....Gus worried about his \\"disfiguration\\" and Hazel worried about mismatched underwear (truly teens here!).  I don't know, it just seemed  by leaving out the sexual \\"play by play,\\" Hazel/Gus retained a secret tenderness that even Hazel doesn't want to share with us.  This is just one example of Mr. Green's story-telling ability.  I may be purchasing some of his other works ...as he is new to me.

0679643362|4.0|Most people have read Siddhartha, this is the 5th time for me although before it was Hilda Rosner's translation.<br /><br />First I want to say I am subtracting a star because of the intro by Tom Robbins. In the beginning he made a statement that Hesse experimented with \\"hallucinogenic mescaline\\". I did not know this and started researching it. I could find statements that he \\"may\\" have and one biographer said maybe but he doesnt think so. How can Robbins make such a flat out statement unless he has some proof. This bothered me and I stopped reading the intro. I dont see this statement as being true so now I would question everything he claims. The into should be removed unless they have evidence.<br /><br />For the translation, it is good. I was comparing it to Rosner's from time to time as I read. The wording is not radically different, a little similar actually but Bernofsky's flows well and has good rhythm. There were 3 things that seemed questionable. She used the word \\"bar\\" where as Rosner uses \\"inn\\" and \\"pen pusher\\" to Rosner's \\"sacrificial official\\". Bar and pen pusher seemed to me a little inauthentic and did not to fit the people and times then.<br /><br />Also Bernofsky uses the term \\"child people\\" (\\"Kind Menschen\\"), whereas Rosner uses \\"ordinary people\\" (\\"gewoumlhnliche Menschen\\") throughout the book. Child people just sounded awkward to me. I wonder what the German words that Hesse used would actually translate to. Although Theodore Ziolkowski uses \\"child-people\\" in his analysis of Siddhartha. I suppose it does describe better how Siddhartha viewed the people that played the daily games of ordinary life. In terms of translation theory sometimes the literal translation looses some of its meaning into the English phrase resulting in a more workman like translation. It seems Bernofsky has more successfully captured the spirit of what the author intended.<br /><br />These may be picky things, they just stuck in my mind while reading. But it reads very well and I would recommend it. Everyone should read Hesse, it is a real treat.and I would recommend it. Everyone should read Hesse, it is a real treat.

0345803485|3.0|My daughter gave me this book. It was a decent read, very Harleqluin Romance-ish, If you throw in a bit of S & M. I found the writing good, NOT GREAT. She repeated the same descriptions over and over again. And how many times can you say \\"JEEZ\\" before we want to pull our our hair? And what about the premise that a stunningly gorgeous young woman in her twenties, who happens to be a virgin, would be willing, first time out, to walk into a Red room of pain and not want not to run for the hills . . . unbelievable. Apart from that, the story does flow and you do get a peek into the world of whips and chains.  The Sex scenes are decent, if you enjoy reading pornography. The trilogy has two other books, but since my daughter already told me what happens I'm going to pass on reading them.

0439023513|5.0|In the world of fantasy, Trilogies often use tragic means to create a happy ending but when that fantasy clings to the real life pangs of the human condition, anything can happen. What struck me most about the Hunger Gamer series was the author's desire to let people in on the discomfort both physical and psychological of her characters. Extreme situations fraught with violent outcomes always damage the psyche of the individuals who endure them. Humanity was not meant to survive an onslaught, we are fragile creatures and yet our yearning to exist pushes us through unreasonable circumstances and out the other side.<br /><br />Katniss, Peeter, Gale, the families of District 12 and 13 are all survivors of tremendous terrors. They all carry the scars of a life lived on the edge but it is because of their struggles that we persist in reading. We consider how we might falter if America crumbled into the same fate as Panem. We consider how or if we would want to survive. Mockingjay is a fitting ending to a tragic tale. While Suzanne Collins allows the sun to shine on another day, she does so while forcing us all to face it with a few more tears.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|For whatever reason, I never got to see any of the Trilogy in theatres so I had no expectations other than the opportunity to watch a movie I'd heard good reviews about.  Amazon shipped my product promptly (as they do with most everything I order - and believe me I order a LOT).  The problem was when I opened the product and tried to watch it, it would not play on my Blu-Ray player.  I had just finished watching the Deathly Hollows parts 1 and 2, and the disk player is relatively new and the firmware up to date.  I have been able to watch any of the other movies in my library, but the Jurassic Park Blu-Ray disk had the following issues:<br /><br />1. Only the trailer came on IN A LOOP - I spent over an hour trying to get the top menu to come up on the screen;  Then I could not eject the disk from the player, my entire system was frozen;<br /><br />2. Reinserted disk (after unplugging the player and pressing the eject button when turned back on) and spent 35 minutes waiting before the Universal logo finally showed up - the unit was frozen again and the top menu button didn't work, the pop-up menu did not work, and I wound up unplugging and ejecting again.  After multiple tries and much frustration, I contacted Amazon and they sent an RMA for the return of the product plus they comped me $10 for the frustration factor.<br /><br />3. The same day, I reordered the set, making sure the product was from Amazon - while the customer service was rep on the phone.  (BTW both sets came from Amazon, not from a third party.)<br /><br />4. Received set through Prime and opened it anxiously anticipating viewing it.<br /><br />5. Quickly inserted disk and encountered many (most) of the same problems.<br /><br />6. I left the product in the player, and after an amazing 45 minute wait, the Universal image came up on the screen.  And all of a sudden the top menu came up on the screen with no prompting!  Imagine my thrill.  However, I could not click the \\"Play\\" icon on the screen nor could I arrow down, to either side or up, or anything else.  Each button resulted in the message, \\"That operation cannot be performed on the disk at this time.\\"<br /><br />7. Magically after another 15 minutes of frustration and just waiting, I was able to click on the pop-up menu and selected the \\"play all\\" option, and THE MOVIE STARTED - IN FRENCH!<br /><br />8. I paused the movie and tried to get back to the setup.  That didn't work.  I stopped the movie, and that didn't work.  I simply could not get back to the top menu.<br /><br />9. I called Amazon customer service again.  They informed me the movie was set to display in French, English or Spanish.  With the customer service rep on the line, I tried to get the top menu up again to set to English, but could not.  I felt something was drastically wrong with the disk and said so to the customer service rep.  First of all, I shouldn't have to wait 1 full hour just to get to the menu, then go through all the convolutions to get the darned thing to play.<br /><br />10. Customer service rep at first said they would send me an RMA and I would have to go through the entire process again.  What I wanted to know was what assurance I had that the same problems wouldn't occur again.  The rep put me on hold.<br /><br />11. When the customer service rep returned to the line, I was told Amazon had received \\"a large number\\" of complaints and customers were being referred to the Universal Studios (888-721-7210) and Universal would have to resolve the problems, there was nothing more Amazon could do.<br /><br />12. I called Universal, and as per their instructions on the VMM, left my name, my phone number and a brief message about the problem I was having with my product and asked if they could give me a call back, saying I was available anytime.<br /><br />13. A week passed with no return call.  I called the Universal number again and got the same VMM and left the same message.<br /><br />14. Bottom Line:  I'm holding a $37 lemon and no way to get my money back nor watch the movie at this time.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I bought a pair of these for my fiance, and he's had them 2 years or more. They have a classic look that those hideous rubber Crocs don't.In fact, he had me get him 3 more pair in beige(in case they change them) plus 2 in herringbone(not shown here). He says the bumps inside are like an oriental foot massage, every time he wears them. Also he looked at something about oriental accu-presure,and it appears that's what they do. Every area of the body(organs, etc) has a connection to the foot. Stimulating these pressure points, helps promote a healthy body, without pain, and less diseases!(not that these are the only ones with those bumps)<br /><br />The first pair's still look great. Cleaning these are a breeze. I spot check with Dawn(dish detergent) then let soak in luke warm water. I then toss into washer on delicate cycle, and let air dry.I've read of others shrinking theirs, by washing& using the dryer, which is unnecessary.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I'm very happy to have this version of Beauty & the Beast. It's a well-done version with good features in attractive packaging.  I found the price to be quite reasonable based on the BluRay quality and the general pricing of Disney BlueRay discs. Definitely recommended for anyone who loves the movie and wants to add it to their collection.

B007K3JFUQ|1.0|This is a great movie but what is not great is the deceptive advertising that goes with it. I thought that I was getting a 2-disc version of the movie,<br />dvd and digital copy. There is no copy, you get one disc. There was a little piece of paper on the front of the case that said something about going online and getting the digital. I didn't have any desire to do that so threw the whole thing away. Like most other things, they are now trying to rip off people with clever advertising - you don't get what you think you are, less for you money.  They should not even mention digital copy or anything else, just tell it like it is - you are getting a DVD, period.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This sixth season counts twelve episodes, which is fitting since it is based on the Christian Apocalypse, in fact not the one in John's Book of Revelation, but another reconstructed version widely enriched with the numerous apocalypses that exist or existed in the Levant and even the Middle East traditions,  going back to the Zoroastrians and the Babylonians, hence to the old apocalyptic visions we can find in old Sumerian documents (clay tablets)  and Zoroastrian stories that are as old as the Sanskrit Vedas, if not even older. But altogether we remain within the vast tradition of the three originally-if-not-still-Semitic religions.<br /><br />It is a fad today, and has been for quite a while, to integrate the Apocalypse in TV series. I can just quote the most famous ones like \\"Supernatural\\" in the USA (WB TV) and \\"Being Human\\" in Great Britain (BBC). And of course we have to think of the secular vision or rewriting of it in the long series of \\"Terminator\\" and the \\"Sarah Connors chronicles.\\" But \\"Supernatural\\" is seen from the point of view of the monster hunters who try to prevent the coming of the apocalypse that is programmed in an inescapable way, and yet, there is always a way out when there is a way in. On the other hand \\"Being Human\\" is the apocalypse seen from the point of view of vampires and it is again the attempt to stop it by blocking the taking over of the earth by the Old Ones (the vampires from the original millennia of humanity). This sixth season of \\"Dexter\\" takes the apocalypse from the point of view of a deranged, fundamentalist Christian zealot who thinks that by enacting the prediction you could bring the end of the world. Dexter is thus the one who is trying to stop the criminal and that is not easy.<br /><br />If you consider the apocalypse and all the religious bull that goes along with it in the minds of all latter night (not to speak of days) prophets, read my lips to see who I mean, is undrinkable, just avoid this season. If on the other side you are only interested in serial killers and catching them, what's more if you believe in one serial killer being able to catch all the serial killers and pass them to the other side of the transatlantic Gulf Stream back to Europe where they probably or obviously belong, then welcome to this season.<br /><br />But there is a lot more than that.<br /><br />The series this season definitely defends the idea that you have to believe in some kind of higher force behind the universe. It ridicules the fundamentalist zealots of the three originally-if-not-still-Semite religions for sure. But it states very clearly these people are dangerous.<br /><br />In the same way it ridicules the fundamentalist zealots of the evolutionary theory that can only impose their stuff with harsh and purely rhetorical attacks on the creationist point of view, hence the zealot fundamentalist originally-if-not-still-Semite beliefs. Rhetoric is not an argument and certainly not evidence or proof of anything. It is nothing but play on words and superficial semantic jingling juggling. In fact there is no proof of any sort on either side.<br /><br />On one hand the question \\"Who created the universe?\\" and the answer \\"God.\\" will bring the next question: \\"Who created God?\\" And there is no end in that direction except the crazy science fiction of Ron L. Hubbard and Scientology that we are nothing but the rejects of an extra-terrestrial civilization that existed zillion, zillion, zillion, zillion, zillion years ago. And then \\"Who created these extra-terrestrials?\\"<br /><br />On the other hand if you are on the side of evolution and science, nothing comes from nothing. We can say the beginning of the universe we know is a famous \\"big bang\\" but then since nothing comes from nothing (Lavoisier among others in the 18th century) that \\"big bang\\" came from something, there was something before that \\"big bang\\". Then what was it and where did that come from? Evolution is a theory that perfectly explainslife, in fact not only vegetal and animal life but also mineral and cosmic life, the way we know it and over a very long period of time, knowing that what we see at the outer limits of the visible universe (with modern technology) is what it was billions of years ago and we have no way to know what it is today, except through speculation and reconstruction.<br /><br />In the same way this season uses a lot of symbols in the most irritating way, especially the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. It is written somewhere: \\"I am the alpha and the omega\\" but it is in fact slightly more than that: \\"I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.\\" (Bible, Revelation 1:8, Standard American Version). The first part states that there was no time before the beginning, and states that there will be no time after the end. That led Saint Augustine to considering that eternity, before the creation and after the end of this world is timelessness. But then how can the past \\"was\\", the present \\"is\\" and the future \\"is to come\\" not be seen as contradictory, except if you play on words and consider that verbal tenses refer to time and hence there is no past and no future before and after the creation and the end of it. \\"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.\\" (Bible, Ecclesiastes, 1:2, Standard American Version) Just as if the eclipse of the last episode was the end of the world. How naïve!<br /><br />As entertainment this season is great, even maybe greater than the previous ones because there is a fairly tighter unity of the twelve episodes and a fairly ugly fight for power at the head of the Miami Metro Police Department. But as for the ideology and the ideas it transports and even bombards onto you it is slightly naïve and definitely over-powerful. We are not supposed to think about all those theories and political or ideological ideas, but at the very same time it is unfair to crush the audience with such heavy-weight hammers and expect the audience to say thank you and not be in anyway influenced by it. Luckily the classification of the season is -18, \\"suitable only for persons of 18 years and over\\" and \\"not to be supplied to anyone under that age,\\" but even so how can we assume that over 18 year olf people can be un-influenced by such heavy at least graphic arguments.<br /><br />In fact it is not the apocalypse per se that is at stake here but the exclusive reference to the three originally-if-not-still-Semite religions. \\"Supernatural\\" is careful to refer to a lot of religions and other beliefs. \\"Being Human\\" is careful to refer to a lot of theories that have nothing to do with the three afore-mentioned religions. But this season of \\"Dexter\\" is extremely narrowly targeting that particular vision in the three afore-said religions. At least the Buddhist can have a great laugh at it.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|From the day this film came out in theaters I have been watching it regularly. I watch it about every year and a half. It is one of Lynch's better films and if it were not for Elephant Man would maybe be his best. Although many Lynch fans may disagree with me on that one. Few films have been able to accomplish what this movie has. It is a study on the notion of forgiveness and importance of family. It's about a lonely pilgrimage which really plays on an important part of Lynch's personal life. Lynch has said on occasion that one of his favorite things to do is just sit in a chair and think (Lynch is also big on meditation). Alvin Straight, \\"It's amazing what you see when you are just sitting.\\" Lynch used to go to a restaurant to sit and look at the silverware, think and write on the napkins because \\"Ideas are the best things going.\\" Alvin is a walking contradiction which is all resolved by the fact that he is riding a lawn mower 500 miles. How is this possible? The answers is in the stars. If you like action movies then this is not going to work for you at all. This is more for the student of film and the person who likes to think. I would not disagree with the person who says that the movie is not entertaining. It's a slow movie. It's about an old man driving a lawnmower for goodness sake! It captures the feeling of the slow country life. There are long distance shots that really make you feel like you are familiar with the landscape. There are only a few times in which the movie makes you feel like you are riding the mower with Alvin, which was a good decision. If you are simply emotionally moved by this film then I think you have probably missed the point and maybe some of the finer details. Yes it is emotionally moving but it is more than that. It is a series of pictures pieced together to tell one tale from many different angles. Lynch took this so seriously he wouldn't allow chapters in the final DVD release. Why did he allow chapters in his other films? Because he needs you to watch it in one sitting to get what is going on. Amazing film. I have endeavored not to \\"over think\\" this movie. Think too hard when watching Mulholland  Drive and in my opinion you are wasting your time because it's a television pilot with an ending pasted on not unlike the Twin Peaks Pilot made for the Japanese market. The Straight Story can only be observed well or not. If you are thinking too hard then you are missing its meaning. This film is a huge departure from Lynch's artistic philosophy. Commonly he would prefer the viewer create or derive their own meaning like a moving painting (Six Men Getting Sick). But with Straight Story he has crafted a work of genius with clear meaning. Mary Sweeney (co-writer) hoped he would fall in love with the project and that he would direct it which is exactly what happened. Thank God for her influence on the film, she deserves a lot of credit.
B008GJV4F2|3.0|Eleven years after its release, I finally watched Chocolat. I laughed, I cried, and I cringed a little bit.<br /><br />The premise is as human as it can be - how do people go about integrating someone different into their midst? Not so well, as it turns out. Juliet Binoche who plays the complex Vivanne is beyond stellar in her performance. Judi Dench - well, she's Judi Dench! Fabulous. Alfred Molina does a fantastic job at playing the highly unlikeable Comte and Mayor of the village, eventually showing his vulnerable side, and then finally giving in to it, becoming very likeable in the end. Lena Olin (playing Josephine) undergoes a similarly dramatic transformation under the loving acceptance (and chocolate) of Vivianne. Vivanne herself reveals more of her shadow self as the story unfolds, thus keeping her character interesting.<br /><br />Of course I had heard about the uncannily steamy romance between Roux (Johnny Depp) and Vivianne (Juliette Binoche) and was anxiously awaiting this delicious morsel. Ah - however... Johnny Depp's character lacked the interesting intricacies of the other roles. But more importantly, his acting was tepid and his assumed accent was an abomination. It vacillated from Spanish-esque, French-esque, to Irish brogue, and sort of settled in the Irish range for the duration of the movie. Really? No language coaches? As the male romantic lead, he paled against Juliette Binoche.<br /><br />Nonetheless, overall an entertaining and darling movie. Made me want to run out and get some really good chocolate.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I've always been fascinated with the idea of what other world's or the clearer possibility of alternate \\"dimensions\\" would look like. And this movie satisfies and entertains those matters very well. The cinematography and special effects are superb. The story is well written and draws you in from start to finish. I would highly recommend this movie, and I believe this is one of the best you'll find in production for 2012 viewing.
B0045HCJRQ|4.0|great movie, arrived early and in good condition just as stated would use this dealer again. But let's get on with the movie If you have not had the oppertunity to see Jody Foster and Richard Gere then you have missed a Civil War love story that leaves you tearful and wanting to rewrite the ending. In a time when tradition and women's rights were deeply divided one can only embrace the courage that Jody Fosters character displays by her dicision to live the dream of love for a man she only wished her husband to be. great chick flick though I have to confess to seeing this movie in the theater and the gentleman sitted next to me felt moved emotional at the end as he kept saying to me don't cry it will turn out ok and was just as moved by the ending as I was. recommend as a great movie to watch.

159114325X|3.0|I have expected the same outstanding quality of the former books authored by Breyer and Skwiot.  Their joint effort is. however, disappointing.  Most of the photographs offered in the present volume have been previously published in other works.  The only advantage is having them now enlarged and collected in one book.  It is true that many wartime photographs of Kriegsmarine's capital ships are blurred and the availability of good \\"action shots\\" is limited.  It is equally true that there are also several photographs of extremely high quality.  Unfrotunately, too many of the former type have been selected for the present album - they are valueless to the modeller, and, since most of them have been published elsewhere, they offer nothing new to a naval historian.  Finally, those who seek photographs of German ships during their combat days will be disappointed - most of the material shows the vessells either in their pre-war days or during the early stages of WW2.<br /><br />The captions accompanying photographs are frequently banal (e.g., p. 227: \\"Although the weather is foggy, it is clear that the catapult has been removed...\\") or simply odd (e.g., the caption accompanying the famous photograph of Prien's submarine passing the Scharnhorst and her cheering crew upon the U-boat's return from sinking the Royal Oak reads: \\"In the foreground one of many German submarines returning to base...\\")  By trivializing captions' content the authors missed the opportunity of expaanding the text describing each ship and provide additional factual information about the depicted vessel, its characteristics, unusual aspects of construction, appearance, etc.<br /><br />The quality of the historical background of the ships presented in the book is largely an abbreviated version of the earlier (and outstanding) English and German texts by Siegrfried Breyer on capital vessels of not only Kriegsmarine but other nations as well. In addition to prior works by Siegfried Breyer, Whitley's still available \\"German Capital Ships of World War Two[[ASIN:0304357073, Arms & Armour) (Vol 15)]] offers a much more exhaustive treatment of design and operational histories while providing a quite decent pictographic support.  In many aspects the latter books, even if some have been published only in German, present a better source of information for those with more than perfunctory interest in the subject than the present album.<br /><br />The main value of Breyer's and Skwiot's work is purely esthetical.  It is a well produced, large format volume published in the best style of the Naval Institute Press; it is a pleasing book to leaf through and to recognize photographs seen on many previous occasions this time presented in full page blow-ups.  There are also some new items or those that have not been published with a near boring frequency, and these are worth looking at.  However, with its substantial price, this is a book for readers either devoted to Kriegsmarine or with already exhaustive naval libraries willing accept a high price for a limited amount of new photographic informastion.  Readers (and modellers) who are merely curious about the heavy units of the German fleet will be probably better served by the excellent books on the subject published by Osprey, Kagero, or Seaforth Publishing.

Build quality is superb, the pins are intact and it even has a nice weight to it due to the materials used. For cosplayers, Trekkies or collectors, I highly recommend this item especially for the price. Thanks Amazon. You're come though for me again.

B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I'm not a big Steven Soderbergh fan, (I don't hate the guy, I just don't actively seek out his movies) but of the few movies that I've seen - 'Traffic', 'Che', 'Solaris', 'The Informant!' to name a few - I haven't been disappointed, yet, and neither does 'Haywire'. It's an action film with a story that's nothing new, but it's serviceable, and it's perfect if you're looking for something to just pop in, sit back and relax and enjoy.<br /><br />Gina Carano is Mallory Kane, a mercenary who is set up for a murder and finds herself the target of her own mercenary contract company and, unlike the audience, she's not going to take that sitting back. The story's been done before and from the onset, we can pretty much guess who the dastardly, double-crossing bad guys are, but Soderbergh manages to keep us engaged with a brisk pace and some nice, unexpected, little twists.<br /><br />Acting-wise, the A-listers (McGregor, Tatum, Fassbender etc.) competently pull off their roles as you would expect them too. For a newcomer, Gina Carano also holds her own with what she is given; she's sexy, dangerous and in control and it gives her a strong screen presence. When she jumps into action, running, climbing, kicking ass, she delivers as good as she gets...move over Jason Statham.<br /><br />Speaking of action, it's fast and brutal. There are fights, shoot-outs, car chases...the works. I'm thankful that Steven Soderbergh keeps the camera still with little cutting during action so I can actually track what's going on, it's not that I don't appreciate the in-the-action handheld style of shooting that directors so love to use these days, but if you've got a well-choreographed hand-to-hand fight, I want to see it, not bits and pieces because of jarring camera work.<br /><br />It's not perfect - I still have some questions about the plot - but 'Haywire' is a fun ride. Carano's an enjoyable leading lady to watch, the action is hard-hitting and Soderbergh adds some real flair with his direction and cinematography work to what would've been a by-the-numbers action movie in the hands of anyone else. It's worth the watch.

B00006HBUA|1.0|It fails to be both a satire and a homage to the old 1960's cartoon of the same name. It's jokes are soo bad that even South Park would call foul on them and its effects are no better too. The movie also has a lot of mean-spirited moments like Shaggy wanting to sacrifice his friends in order to save himself. In-fact, none of the cast members act nothing like the ones in the cartoon. Its use of supernatural elements is out of place in the Scooby-Doo World and I'm not counting the 1980's/1990's TV movies. The dumbest part of the movie is finding out that Scrabby-Doo(Scooby-Doo's Nephew) was the villain the whole time mainly because it was poorly handled. The only upside is Matthew Lillard's performance but it still fails to help in the film in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|The second season of \\"Castle\\" comes in five DVDs, packaged in a nice, sturdy case.  The best (in addition to the eps themselves) is that there's a series of Bonus features in the fifth disk.  I cannot recall if there are episodes with a commentary track.  However, the series is worth the investment just in the fact that each episode is close-captioned and also has subtitles in several languages (no dubbed tracks).  I am glad I bought them and have watched them already more than twice.  This show is dangerously addictive... but then, if you're reading this review and contemplating the purchase of the second season, you're a lost cause.  Let's enjoy the show!<br /><br />EDIT: I have checked and there are NO episodes with commentary in these discs.  In short, season 2 of \\"Castle\\" has no commentary track for any episode.
B000NQPZCY|1.0|I can't believe I bought this \\"blu-ray\\" and did not get the original version of the movie and this \\"director's cut\\" of the movie totally cut out some of the most crucial scenes of  the original movie that made the original movie one of my favorites!  I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this so called \\"director's cut\\" and if they wanted to ruin the original... they should have at least, given the consumer the opportunity to view both versions on the blu-ray!  If you are a fan of the original of this movie or have heard about how great this movie is...DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! :(
B003L77FYS|5.0|Not only do I think that the third season of \\"Castle\\" is a tour-de-force, I also believe that the nicely cased DVDs offer a good deal more than one thinks.  EACH disk has some type of Bonus Features, and the fifth one has the most.  I won't add anything about the series quality, because I'm sure you, the reader of this review, already know how good it is.  Let's just say that it's very well done, with subtitles in various languages, close-captioning and English soundtrack.  The video quality is quite satisfactory, and so are the extras (like deleted scenes and bloopers, besides featurettes and commentaries).  In short, it's worth buying.
B007XH6BPG|2.0|I've been a fan of Hackett and Squire's music (and Yes/early-mid Genesis) since the 70's.  I was quite disappointed in this effort.  I LOVE the first track and maybe 2 or 3 others (of the 9 tracks) but the rest are very generic--you may not even know that they are by Squire/Hackett unless someone told you.  If  you are expecting anything close to the majesty of \\"Fish out of Water\\" or \\"Voyage of the Acolyte,\\" you will be disappointed.  My expectations were not nearly that high.  Yet, I was still very disappointed.<br /><br />If you want to get a  good prog. album, get Trevor Rabin's (Yes, Trevor Rabin!) \\"Jacaranda\\" CD.  With that one I was pleasantly surprised.  :)
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I won't delve on the contents of \\"Castle\\" because if you're reading this review, you want to know about the DVDs, not the show.  All in all, mine came in a sturdy plastic case without anything too fancy.  The image quality and resolution are great, and I only wish they had MORE commentaries on different episodes and MORE special features (or bonus features, as they're called in the DVDs).  There are subtitles in several languages and all the eps are CC.  Worth watching the first and fifth episode for the juicy, fun running commentary from Nathan Fillion (in both) and Stana Katic (in one only, alas!), in addition to Christopher Marlowe's and Rob Bowman's.  Even though I found some eps online and have them in my laptop, this collection offers a lot better quality and sound.  Definitely a requirement for Castle fans!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|like<br /><br /> (NLT)Joshua 5:10-12<br />While the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they celebrated Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month. [11] The very next day they began to eat unleavened bread and roasted grain harvested from the land. [12] No manna appeared on the day they first ate from the crops of the land, and it was never seen again. So from that time on the Israelites ate from the crops of Canaan.

B000009HF2|1.0|I could never understand why this album was so popular when it first came out and still can't, after all these years, understand why this live performance is so beloved by so many people. It's annoying in the way the audience responds so admiringly to the mediocre performance. So pretentious and corny. I swear everyone must have been high or brainwashed on a Peter Frampton acceptance drug given to them before the concert. Boring. And to think that this is one of the top selling live records of all time.....jeeez.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Despite all the negatives, this is a fun read and will keep you reading.<br /><br />Very far-fetched and stupid coincidences.  The problem is, the coincidences were not necessary- just a lazy way out for the author-- he could have come up with explanations instead<br /><br />But, the main character is fun to read. Yes, he is unrealistic and there is a lot of violence-- but that is the nature of this genre.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game sucked.I hatted it.I used to play on my ipod and it was really fun.I decided to get it on my kindle fire thinking it would be fun.pppphhhhtttt,not a chance.plz think about what  u could go through when downloading this app,and its not good!
1439170916|5.0|A Pulitzer?  Yes, this book won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize.  THE EMPEROR OF ALL MALADIES does provide a stunning history of the main discoveries, setbacks, politics, et al., of cancer, but it isn't without numerous faults.  The word \\"careering\\" was used instead of \\"careening;\\" \\"$20,000\\" was used instead of the figure \\"$200,000\\" in another important sentence; the use of far too many parenthetical comments also distracts from the manuscript.<br /><br />The author often added statements that can only be described as trying too hard to be poetic or elegant.  In my humble opinion, those literary ornaments failed.  For example, while providing a brief history of Luther Terry, the author writes: \\"Terry had thus spent his childhood in the penumbra of tobacco and his academic life in the penumbra of cancer.\\"  That sentence brings little value to the end of the paragraph and could have been deleted.  In another concluding sentence, the author loses his compassion and hopeful tone when he wrote of an elderly patient that he didn't think could survive the treatment \\"I don't know if she died from the treatment or the cancer.\\"  As I stated, that seems to me to be lacking in compassion not to mention follow-up.<br /><br />It's very interesting to me that a highly educated MD would write a compendious though accessible book--the chapters are very short making for easy reading--that reads like a journalistic novel.  Compare it with the works of Gary Taubes in which a journalist writes works that read like highly-informative and accessible medical books.  Faults and tone notwithstanding, for the history of cancer, for providing such a great overview of a terribly difficult subject, for the education it provides, it is highly recommended... - lc

1439190275|5.0|In his first book, Dr. Atkins didn't differentiate between types of carbohydrates, he simply aimed to have folks limit them.  In THE NEW ATKINS, three giants in the field of weight loss update the original manuscript with studies for further reading, individual case studies, and some of the science behind very low carbohydrate dieting.  As stated in the dedication, the late Dr. Robert C. Atkins established the nutritional principles that remain the core of the Atkins Diet.  This innovative thinker worked tirelessly to help people understand how to improve their health by implementing these principles.  With every passing year, independent research continues to confirm the wisdom of his ideas.  Highly recommended... - lc

0345803485|2.0|I only read it because half the people were all \\"OMG, IT SUCKS\\" and the other half are all \\"OMG, IT ROCKS\\". In a situation like this there is only one solution. And that is to make up my own mind about this book. So I got it and read it.<br /><br />At first I was really annoyed at the fact that the writing and dialogue was so British and the characters were based in Seattle, USA. I get it James wanted to be \\"mainstream\\" but seriously! It was so bad and overwhelmingly irritating. If you're going to write about people living in the States and they're 100% American, try and do some research on how they talk and the words they use. I had to fade out their actual location and their nationality so the dialogue wouldn't be so annoying. ARGH!<br /><br />After I got over the dialogue, I got irritated by Ana's use of words... like Jeez, Oh my, Inner Goddess, Holy Moses... Seriously woman. You're like on the verge to commit yourself as a \\"Submissive\\" and you don't have the decency to actually learn how to swear. She even says f*** and sh**. I don't see why she can't do it instead of Oh my, holy moses and all that crap. Tsk.<br /><br />Yea, sure... the book had a lot of sex, BDSM and bad dialogue. But when you skip all the BDSM, and read further... James actually lessens the bad dialogue and simply focuses on something else. This book is more about a girl trying to breach and set a man free from his demons. Isn't that what most romance books are all about?<br /><br />The book actually had character development... yes... with a bad annoying character like Ana. But you get used to her. Well, I did. But every time she says Oh my, I get annoyed still and makes me hate her some more. There is a lot of romance, even if the guy is a little cold. Towards the end, Ana actually comes to her senses and Christian is beginning to change and his wall begins to crumble.<br /><br />I knew what to expect when I began to read it and I expected to hate the book but I still kept an open mind about it and at the moment, I say it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I think it might be because I skipped all the BDSM and stuck to whatever angst and romance James has lurking in this book.it and at the moment, I say it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

B008VOHQNQ|5.0|The show is really amazing. I love lawyer shows like fairly legal and this. I love them because they can be serious but also humorous at the same time. This show is really addictive, The relationships between the characters draws you in. I recommend this to people.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|It does play files, as long as you don't enable hardware acceleration, and if you don't mind everything being horribly out of sync. Does Amazon even try any applications before they post them? So many fail, especially the media players.
0143115014|5.0|I can not put this book down.  It is very informative if you are a perfume lover and would like to read up on a scent before purchasing.  The writing is very clever and they cover perfumes from high end to drug store buys.  I feel that Turin and Sanchez know their perfumes and this book will be my go to for perfume buying. A wonderful read.

B004EPYZP8|3.0|I watch this movie on dish other day I think it was a little to predictable in plots. I figured it out soon enough the hero was goinging to get even with the client for killing his buddy. The biker guys  really gave him a beat down and there was several actors in movie that could have been deleted since they did not add any value. The Love interest Marsha Tomei  role could have been bigger. Overall the movie was Ok and it is the kind of movie you can watch more the once.  3stars and I wanted to give it 4 stars but as stated the plots were like you seen it before.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I don't find the special features (programmable buttons, simulated surround sound, some silly voice-altering feature) compelling enough to overlook it's more basic problems as wireless headphones.<br /><br />The biggest problem: bugginess. There are times when it distorts simple sounds (like Windows' folder navigation click) and occasionally sets the balance incorrectly (I spend a full round in a game wondering if there were others to my right because my footsteps weren't centered).<br /><br />Second biggest problem: interference. Microwave running will take it down at quite a distance (more than my ASUS headphones from long ago) this manifests as intermittent and digitally-distorted sounds. Charging while wearing the headphones will cause interference on the left side (very disappointed in Logitech for not doing more in the hardware to avoid this). Update (Dec 2012): also WiFi from an adjacent laptop can introduce cracking (akin to the sound heard when turning the plug in an analog jack).<br /><br />These two things make the headphones unreliable and frustrating and I certainly would not recommend them.
1410440478|1.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan, I usually don't follow the crowds.  As a Red Sox fan my first experience with his writing was Fever Pitch, and I couldn't even get through that book!  I should have known not to even crack open this tome.  Like others who gave it 1 star (I'd have given in 0 if I could)  this book was  way over written. By about page 150, I was skimming by  reading the first sentence of each paragraph and at times felt that was even too much!  I found myself wondering if Stephen King is a narcissistic egotist who just writes to put more on  paper? The repetitive obdurate made me want to scream, why didn't you just name the book OBDURATE already?  By page 400 I was reading the first line of each page.  I am so glad that I didn't spend money on this book.  I'm glad Stephen King fanatics love it, but for the rest of you...don't bother.

0143119680|5.0|When I finished book one, A Discovery of Witches, I could not wait for the second book in the series to come out...this book takes up right where book one left off. The attention to detail is amazing, and it was a book well worth the wait. I am now awaiting the third book in this trilogy with great anticipation. The only helpful hint I would offer to make this book a \\"perfect read\\"...if it has been more than a few months since you have read A Discovery of Witches, re-read it. It will make this book flow more easily. It had been a year between books for me, and for the first few chapters, I had to stop and think of the references to book 1, and who was who when the characters referenced things that had happened...but it still flowed for me, and the book did not lose me...<br /><br />Deborah Harkness, please hurry with the third book in this trilogy!!!

B005LAII62|4.0|Paranorman is a movie about a boy who can see ghosts and this leads to him being considerered a freak and an outcast in his hometown. However, he starts to have visions about diaster to his town, and this comes at the time of the 300th anniversary of the murder of a 'witch' and her curse. Norman's crazy uncle has been doing a ritual for many years to keep the curse and witch contained.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he dies leaving the task to Norman and due to misinterpretation and lack of reliabel info, he ends up missing the deadline causing zombies to rise.<br /><br />The thing I would compliment the movie on the most is characterization. It is good at the show, don't tell rule. You can tell so much about Norman just by how the world interacts toward and the enviroment. This is this wonderful shot of Norman ,at the beginning, when he is just walking along a dessert street adn talking to (what appears) to be no one. At school we get how his peers think of him when we see 'freak' has been written on his locker. He casually takes out cleaning supplies, this scene tells us that this happens often.<br /><br />We also have good characterization of the side characters as well. Although they mainly stick to stereotypes like Courtney, the self-centered teen girl and the dumb jock. His best friend ,Neal, comes off as instantly likable and a lovable character.<br /><br />The stop-motion is done in a realistic, yet still cartoon-like fashion. This movie needs praise for it's use of enviroments to create wonderful atmosphere. The graveyard is a wonderful isolated and spooky location. The final 'battle' is also a wonderful set that fits the mood perfectly.<br /><br />The most I think kids and adults will take away from this is that it is okay to be different and even if the world feels like it is a against you, there are still people there for you. I think that is a good message for everyone.<br /><br />I will wanr conservative/Republican parents that this movie has a gay character in it. Though you do not think out till the end. I am not against this, in fact I praise it. I just do not want to hear complaints/lower starts because of that.<br /><br />I do not see this movie as scaring children, simply because the zombies are just too silly.<br /><br />All in all, a good family movier in it. Though you do not think out till the end. I am not against this, in fact I praise it. I just do not want to hear complaints/lower starts because of that.<br /><br />I do not see this movie as scaring children, simply because the zombies are just too silly.<br /><br />All in all, a good family movie
0440244412|5.0|This book put the other 4 books to shame. You think you know the story your reading, but really you have no idea. This book is not only twice the size of the others, its also twice the book! awesome book!! the best in the series, and well worth more than just 5 stars!!

B007857FOO|3.0|I bought this version of Breaking Dawn for a friend who is a huge fan of the Twilight series of books and movies. I am unable to rate it, other than to say it's a great movie, because I do not know what is inside the package that justifies the higher price.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|I thought this was a really good movie. The child actors far surpassed the adults' performances. I normally don't like watching alien movies, but this one had good characters and the alien was the backstory actually. It was more about Joe's loss of his mother and Alice's dad being involved in that somewhat. Also, Joe and Alice like each other.<br />The special effects of the train crash were very good. I wanted to back away as in several scenes I felt as if the train was coming through the screen at me. The train derailment seemed to never end and I waited for someone to be killed in a horrible way as there were train cars and parts flying everywhere.<br />One of the parts I liked best was when the credits were rolling, on the left side the movie the kids had made was playing. Too cute.<br />I recommend this movie to people who like supernatural, alien and horror movies.
0061692042|3.0|The basic storyline is as told.  A fifteen year old boy and girl lose their parents to jail after the latter commit a bank robbery.  Then the plot twists in a world of many bad circumstances that are only somewhat plausible.  Mostly, the book is written exceptionally well yet didn't quite strike much interest in me.  I wondered why....<br /><br />In part, this genre I find depressing - that of someone who gets some bad luck.  In this case, I was also bewildered at some of the plot twists.  And then it threw in just enough of the 1960s stuff to lose my interest (will a certain generation ever keep re-hashing events which weren't that interesting even when they happened!).  I certainly could put the book down and it's very sad.<br /><br />But, but!  This review is not meant to be a bad one.  The prose is lovely if cool, as befits the narrator, an older and somewhat damaged man looking back later in life.  The tone fits the story and story teller.  If this novel is your type of book you'll probably love it.  If not, it's still a worthwhile read if only to watch how a truly masterful author writes...
B007STBUIW|5.0|When reading all these reviews the first thing you should note is that Amazon has for some reason combined comments for previous releases of this movie with the new 2012 Universal's 100th Anniversary Release.  Many of the comments you see here are actually for an older release which is not very smart of Amazon.<br /><br />The 2012 release on Blu-ray is excellent.  It has to be one of the best transitions to Blu-ray from an older movie that I've seen.  It also comes with a DVD version which I have not looked at.  How it compares to previous releases I'm not sure.  It is my understanding though that this is the first Blu-ray release and it appears to be of Blu-ray quality, not just an older DVD version slapped on to Blu-ray.  I'm not sure how the extras compare to previous releases.  It could possibly have some of the same extra's.<br /><br />If you don't already have this movie on Blu-ray then get it.  If you have an older copy of this movie on VHS or Beta then definitely get this.  Even if you have an older DVD copy of this, the Blu-ray is beautiful so get it.  If you have already gone and bought a million upgrades to this movie and are tired of spending money on new releases then no one is forcing you to get it.  It is however worth getting if you are not satisfied with your older copy.
B008CP93S0|4.0|I thought this movie was so funny, it had me laughing to tears multiple times. Definitely not for the prudish type, though, as there is plenty of dirty talk and nudity. I love Paul Rudd's style of comedy and Jennifer Aniston plays on it perfectly. I will absolutely recommend this movie!

B00005N6KG|5.0|My first pair lasted over 5 years. This is unheard of with corded headphones. They get hung up, yanked off, whatever and cut out. My original set has been pulled off while mowing the lawn, hung up in trees and stolen by my dog when I set it down. It is just starting to cut out in one ear so I opted to replace them before they quit. The new headphones work and sound great. Better than an expensive Koss set I had that quit within a few months. There are no earbuds to wear out or replace either. I love them!
0312641893|4.0|I met Marissa Meyer at ALA 2012. She was so nice (and interesting - I didn't realize she had written fan fiction until listening to a panel with her) that I had to read her book. I love fairy tale retellings, but had skipped over this one because I had burned out of the genre. I'm glad I met Ms. Meyer because I would have missed out on this gem.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg, no longer human, and is looked down by society because of it. She is also an orphan who cannot remember her life before becoming a cyborg and who lives with her legal guardian (\\"stepmother\\") and her two step sisters and works as a mechanic. She meets the city's prince \\"Kai\\" (what is with this name? Diana Peterfreund uses it too in For Darkness Shows the Stars) and her world is turned upside down.<br /><br />I actually disliked the parts that were taken from the traditional Cinderella story because they almost seemed out of place. But the world Meyer has created is spectacular. Lunars (people who live on the moon) with the ability to control bioelectricity, cyborgs, princes, a plague, and a mysterious past all add up to a fun story. Can't wait for the sequel.
B007NZDES0|5.0|this is very good if you like sade BY THIS. most of her hit songs are on it. older she get better she looks
0385534639|2.0|I was definitely underwhelmed with this book. Maybe it's the hype; I expected it to be mind-blowingly good. Instead, it's an interesting idea (a black and white circus which is only open at night and kept together by magic) with a not-so-interesting story built around it. The chapters which focused on descriptions of the circus itself were poetic, but the actual storylines were mundane. I would say that the problem is that I listened to the story instead of read it except Jim Dale narrated it and he's a phenonemal narrator. All said, the circus itself was really neat, but the actual book was only okay.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great format.  I don't totally understand why it goes to a new page everytime I highlight a part.  would like it to just highlight the part with a pop up button that brings up all the highlighted parts.  like the kindle.

0812993292|5.0|Has there ever been an event in your life where a friend took the heat for something you did and you responded in a way that you wish you could change?  Or when a friend desperately needed you and you failed them by not being there?  What about now?  Are you in a marriage that has lopped along daily but you've forgotten why you are there?  The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce addresses these subjects in a delightfully thoughtful way.<br /><br />While the title of the story led me to believe the book would be boring, it is an error to judge it by a rather long, uninspired title.  Harold Fry is a character with heart.  A man who has long lived his life in autopilot, but, on a whim, has decided to change the past in his present and, in the process, he creates a ripple effect that causes a national movement.  While rather unrealistic, haven't we found that the most unlikely inspirations can pop up most anywhere?<br /><br />I expected to wander through the novel much like Harold has spent his life:  slow and bored and forcing myself to read it a page at a time; however, what I found was a likable set of characters and I found myself cheering Harold's journey and wondering how it would end.  There were some mystical elements in the novel, but not enough to distract me from what I needed to get from the book personally and what I wanted to see happen in the book.  I cannot tell you whether or not Harold's journey ends successfully, but I enjoyed the book throughout and hope you will give it a try.<br /><br />I received this book as a free offering from goodreads in exchange for my honest review.
B000KIPT30|5.0|This is a very solid piece of equipment. Inexpensive, small, made well and works well.<br /><br />Save some money and get this one.
0345803485|2.0|To the point: This book certainly entertains, but the popularity is likened to the bubonic plague.<br /><br />This contagion has been heralded as the porn for stay-at-home moms - an erotic novel they can fantasize about.<br /><br />But between the lip biting and head tilting (two motions that are repeated without mercy throughout the novel), my brain literally shut down.<br /><br />As a man, I finished the novel wondering what all the fuss was about. This isn't controversial, nor does the literary ability warrant its undeniable popularity.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Challenging and fun (from my adult perspective). Love it! Almost too much for my phone to handle but works great on my Kindle.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that one is still analyzing for months-remembering subtle nuances that could perhaps be clues to the truth. In the end, the genius of this work is that all one is left with is...DOUBT.

034580404X|5.0|If you are looking for a \\"curl your toes\\" read, then please look no further.  E.L. James has put out a great sexual trilogy that certainly bumped my summer up a notch.  Enjoy!
B005HSL626|5.0|its so adicting I can spend hours playing fruit ninja free.<br />the game is awesome and I recamend it to everyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in the trilogy...just as good as the first. Definitely don't read it if you're easily offended by alternative lifestyles. Read this and book three in two days.
0857520652|5.0|Harold walks thru the painful problems of his troubled marriage, his lack of backbone to stand by his friend, and in the process he faces the deep hurts of his loveless childhood.  In the bargin, he not only saves the cost of psycho therapy, but the courage and faith that he portrays by his walk helps his wife and the other people that he meets along the way deal with theirs.  It is a well written book that holds your attention and it has a message for all of us - what more can you ask of a book?
B008PSPNFG|5.0|This is IMO the best all around Vai album. Usually I like a handful of songs and the rest are just throw away for me. Especially when he has someone singing. While there are some songs on this album with singing, they are done well and fit the music. I am thrilled and plan on listening for days on end!
140053271X|5.0|I found tablets and phones lack the battery life and quiet simplicity of this type of specialised product.<br /><br />Forget checking email, listening to audio or constant distractions. This ereader is purely a reading machine. The text is clearer than a laser printed page and the capacity of 32GB micro SD card means accessibility to 10,000's of books.<br /><br />As with my Samsung table I found PDF viewings unsatisfactory and even maps in epubs were a disappointment.<br /><br />Another issue is that, without a US credit card billing address, B&N will not let you use your account so I have had to store by own epubs in the machine and find them elsewhere.<br /><br />The unit is easy to operate and had a claimed battery life of up to two months. It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.<br /><br />The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure. There is only a minuscule delay when turning pages. All in all I am delighted by the unit which is good value for something that holds practically my entire library.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little game and takesup plenty of time! and I think the point system is weird . fun for kids and adults.
0452289963|5.0|I find this book Tolle's best so far!  It is profound and enlightening.  As a spiritual counselor, A New Earth is required reading for my clients and students as I am teaching ego identification.  I have seen lives change from this work.  If you are seriously wanting to change your life, this book is a wonderful foundational tool to do so.  I suggest you read it in small bites, process, and journal as you go, especially if you are new to the concept of the dark ego mentality.  Brilliantly written!  I'm on my third reading of this book!  It's that great.

B003BKZW7C|5.0|A true Stephen King classic. An absorbing reading which draws one in a terrifying story, even more terrifying , when by reading it brings back memories from your own childhood.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I have viewed this movie over and over again. For the reader interested in American and Montanan history, this heroic family saga has it all: a great storyline and terrific acting set against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains.

006197806X|5.0|Alert: May contain spoilers and you most assuredly need to read Delirium before continuing!<br /><br />I am telling you people, I am turning out to be a real sucker for the second book in a series.  I loved Pandemonium, book 2 in the Delirium Series by Lauren Oliver.  First of all, while Delirium was a good story, the writing was a little flat for me, but Oliver remedied that in Pandemonium.  She takes on a \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\" story telling style that sprinkles all of the action and \\"aha\\" moments into the exposition of the story line.  This keeps things moving at a faster pace, the lag time to a minimum and works well with the fickle human nature, as you are continually wanting to get back to the previous account to see what is happening-like mini \\"to-be-continueds\\".  And then the end...A cliffhanger of all cliff hangers.  I mean Lauren Oliver, is this what you want, fans to be tortured.  All I am saying is that I am currently in the process of seeing if I can get my hands on an ARC through a connection of mine.  The possibility is remote, but still there.  Let's hope Oliver continues at this clip with book 3, Requiem due out March 5, 2013.<br />Now for the characters.  I love how Lena is painted through out this story.  She was a small town girl, confined by her limited experience and then thrust out into the great beyond without much to go on.  I love the new found strength Lena carries with her, but you also get a sense of her naivete as she moves through the action and hubbubary of the story.  I appreciate that Oliver did not turn Lena into this all-knowing survivalist and savvy political activist. Refreshing...<br />Now for Julian. I wasn't sure, if I was going to even like this book because you spend all of Delirium falling in love with Alex and now you have to start all over hoping and wondering if and when he will appear again.  Then you meet Julian, and you are like, \\"Who is this cold-hearted, unloving drone that has to tag along with me in my story.  Get this emotionless Zombie out of my way, Julian you are the fly in my ointment!\\"<br />But....<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Alex, I do...It's just...in the end...I don't hate Julian...I might even like him a little...O.K., fine...I'm caught in the love triangle myself as controversial as that may be with Delirium fans.  There I said it, I am right there with Lena, sucked in and completely confuzzled on what to do.  But then again, as I have said before, I do love a good love triangle!<br /><br />My one reservation is that there are some potty mouths in this book, so some might gasp a few times at the expletives in this young adult novel.emotionless Zombie out of my way, Julian you are the fly in my ointment!\\"<br />But....<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Alex, I do...It's just...in the end...I don't hate Julian...I might even like him a little...O.K., fine...I'm caught in the love triangle myself as controversial as that may be with Delirium fans.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|One of the best drama programs on TV, with an excellent cast and some of the best writers ever assembled for a series.
B0009P42S2|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to think--the name & cover makes it sound like a kids' movie, but it is not.  It is a true anime (very artistic, character-driven, & detailed), with a pseudo-futurism twist.  I was surprised at the great character development and detailed story.  On the front cover James looks like some kind of mass-produced anime hero, but he is actually just a regular but intelligent person put in a difficult situation.  I actually got this movie sooner than other anime I wanted to check out, partly because of the cheaper price of Steamboy--it is probably only the name & cover that makes it seem less desirable--but also because though I knew Patrick Stewart's voice was in the English audio track, I later learned it also has Alfred Molina and Anna Paquin (default is Japanese, but English is available on the disc).  If you like movies that are better than most other movies, this is a movie for you, it's that simple.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and the whole series. It was a great way to end the story. Will probably read them all again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Battery HD has several different ways to look at battery function, (ex. Hours &amp; mins to fully charge  from AC source; How long I can listen to music while reading a book) My uses for a meter like this are well met. Ads are not as intrusive as some other &quot;free&quot; apps.  I think it's pretty good.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is awesome!  My children really enjoy the game and the Phineas and Fern show.  The price is right too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great to keep you busy and your mind active. Allows you to go back and best your own scores. Thumbs up!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you want a CD of a variety of Beatles songs, this is a good thing to get.  If you get the Beatles Album '1' that has all their Number One hits, you miss out on a lot of the iconic songs from the late 60's that are more recognizable than a lot of their Number One hits.<br /><br />This is from the Cirque show in Vegas of the same name, the only difference is that the show now plays the entire Blackbird song instead of just the opening stanza.  In fact, don't look at that song list and think that the entire songs are on the CD.  Some of them are just partial songs that serve as openers for others, like Blackbird opens for Yesterday.  And they alter some of the songs, like Because is A Capella on this album where it originally wasn't.<br /><br />So this album is more like a work of art rather than just a collection of songs.  It's a good buy, especially if you're waiting for the Beatles songs to be available as MP3 downloads on Amazon, like I am, instead of using iTunes.
0345803485|1.0|Honestly, this is the worst piece of writing that I have ever come across. The author has no command of the English language, originality, and over-uses words that have clearly been plucked from a thesaurus with no thought as to their suitability for what she is trying to describe. The characters lack any sense of credibility. The writing itself made me feel ill.<br /><br />One reviewer said that it read like a 16 year old girls fantasy. It did. It is THAT BAD.<br /><br />And, like another reviewer, it distresses me that we live in a world where anyone could think that this was literature. I'm not normally this harsh, but if I was the author, I would be embarrassed to call this my work and even more embarrassed that people were buying it.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\" , with its front office focus is a baseball movie with a different twist.  It is the story of Oakland Athletics' General Manager, Billy Beane, who employs a radical economics based system of player selection to lead his small market team in search of the Holy Grail of World Series glory.  The story is intriguing and, to a large extent, true.  The acting is superb.  Brad Pitt plays the role of Beane well and Jonah Hill is convincing as the Yale-educated economist who crunches the numbers to select the players that can bring wins to Oakland.  Enjoy the movie and, at its end, you will want Billy to get that team that does not lose its last game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have not read any Harry Potter, Twilight, or any other kind of Tweener/Teen books.  As I'm past, well past, that age. But we were talking about them at work one day so I decided to download The Hunger Games onto my Kindle.  Fabulous book.  I couldn't put it down.  Ms. Collins is a fantastic writer.  I believe she could make a story about someone standing at a bus stop sound spectacularly interesting.  I can't wait to read the next two.  Well worth the $5 bucks I paid to download it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love the game it is so cool.I can't wait for the next update to come.I want you to make the next update to be beter then the other's.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Good game. A lot like the original.  Having to connect to social sites and pay real money keeps it from getting FIVE stars.)
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this novel. After that is was too predictable. I found myself wanting the story to end by the last portion of the story. Again, the first half was great.
B000068QVN|4.0|Grand Funk Railroad<br />Live: The 1971 Tour (2002 CD)<br /><br />  Comparisons to the 1970 \\"Live Album\\" are inevitable but this presentation of the 1971 tour stands up well against that previous recording.  There are five songs on the 1971 tour CD that cannot be found in the previous \\"Live Album\\", these are `Footstompin Music', and (the four songs from the Shea Stadium Concert:) `I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home', `Hooked On Love', `Get It Together', and their rendition of The Rolling Stone's `Gimmie Shelter'.<br />  This is another very entertaining live CD from Grand Funk Railroad.<br />It is a solid Four Star release.
B004EPZ084|3.0|Ok to watch.  Passes the time.  Crude, not all too funny, but acceptable to watch.  Three male employees who have just horrible bosses and arrange a plan for each other to kill each other's bosses.
B008602KQI|3.0|Naturally, as in all movies based on books, points were changed. I was kinda upset that they changed main details such as who gave Katniss the Mockinjay pin and of course the mutts. With the books one would want to scream because you get trapped in the world of horrors, but with the movie I was like \\"Okay, whatever....\\" Disappointed I paid full price instead of renting, but that's my own fault. Still a decent movie though! If the changing of book details bothers you I wouldn't buy this movie, I would rent it. :)
B005L3HKTU|3.0|I'm new to Insomnium, and listening to this for the first time I should just be loving it, but I noticed a higher frequency buzz that was beginning to make my ears hurt. I looked at the other reviews and some have noticed the sound problems as well. I'm no music producer or anything, but on Windows Media Player, if you switch on the graphic equalizer and initially set it to the Rock setting, then move the bars separately, if you dramatically drop the 4KHz bar, you pretty much get rid of that strange \\"buzz\\" that creates so much noise. I also raised the 8 and 16 KHz bars, and that at least is a good start to getting the recording to be more listenable. It's too bad, because this rates right up there with Omnium Gatherum New World Shadows for melodic composition, but all the variety and subtleties are buried beneath that horrible noise at 4KHz. I'm going to see Insomnium this fall, so hopefully I'll hear these songs as they should be live.
B004SIMNF0|5.0|So I went from the Cameraslinger straps then to the Black Rapid dual strap, and now to the spider holster.  I am currently using the Spider Holster and Black Rapid strap. The Spider Holster is definitely the best out of the three for me.  It is comfortable. I've had more bumps with the straps than I do with the holster.  The holster also feels much more secure.  The thing I didn't like about the straps was that it was a pain to take off when I was in a hurry.<br /><br />I am thinking about buying the dual Spider Holster and getting rid of the straps altogether.  It is expensive but I'm going to say it's totally worth it.

0446563048|5.0|Tony Hsieh's book is a delightful story of bunch of things. It is part autobiography, part philosophy, and a big part business. Somehow he manages to bring it all together effectively. Hsieh and company managed to build an over a one billion dollar business not by focusing on profits or efficiency. That by itself is intriguing but certainly not unique. He tells the story well and weaves it nicely with his life and philosophy of life. I read somewhere (I am not sure where but I believe author, investor, and physician William Bernstein wrote it) that most people think that power, fame, and wealth deliver happiness when in reality autonomy, competence (similar to the concept of \\"flow\\") and connectivity are the true roots of happiness. Hsieh's book reminded me a lot of this saying. He has pursued autonomy and competence through building businesses and solving problems creatively. He also touts connectivity and lives by it through his numerous friendships and passing interest with raves. Remarkably the pursuit of the true sources of happiness has obliquely led to wealth, fame and power for Hsieh.<br /><br />Hsieh's book is worthwhile for a wide audience. You do not necessarily have to be interested in improving or building a business. It is also entertaining and fun. Highly recommended.
0345803493|1.0|If you have read book one, STOP -- DON'T KEEP READING. Book two is an extreme let down. I had most of the same complaints as everyone else about book one (repetition, unrealistic, not much of a plot), but I was still intrigued enough to keep reading - mostly because of Christian's character. And I was interested to see how the whole Mrs. Robinson story-line would pan out. Big mistake. This book  reads like a bad fanfic written by someone in the 10th grade. I should have stopped reading when Ana and Christian got back together within like the first two chapters of the book (LOL)! There is absolutely NO PLOT. Ana and Christian just have tons of sex, tell each other how much they love each, tell each other that they don't deserve each other, and random events are sprinkled in that lead to absolutely nowhere and add nothing to the story. It's like the author herself got bored of writing about Ana and Christian so she added some random event for a couple of pages for no reason. And it felt like the author just wrote as she went along with no clear plan of where the book was going. Even if the story's repetition doesn't bother you, the complete lack of realism will. They have only known each other for what four weeks and they can't live without each other??  Ugh I REALLY wanted to like this book (who doesn't like a good naughty romance?), and I was hoping that it would live up to the hype, but I was sadly mistaken. And don't even get me started on that horrible \\"cliffhanger\\" at the end. Sorry nothing will make me read the 3rd book. This book is HORRIBLE.  SAVE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY!!
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Interesting insight in chinese history. Henry Kissinger may be one of the greatest experts about the subject and his review shows how the chinese culture of growing stronger differs from the western perspective.

B008XBCJ34|1.0|Nice price point, but no extras and no extended release. These features are out there. Why wouldn't they be included with this highly anticipated release? They'll be included in the next one that will tempt people to buy again. I've waited this long, I think I'll wait a little longer.

B000PC0SPU|5.0|For the past few decades, the modern workforce centralized around people who excelled at left brained activities. But due to abundance, automation, and cheap labor overseas, the modern workforce will have to excel at both left and right brain activities. This is the central argument in Daniel Pink's book A Whole New Mind.<br /><br />In the first section, Daniel Pink outlines the current migration from the knowledge age to the conceptual age by contrasting left and right hemisphere thinking, arguing that cheap foreign labor and software is devaluing left hemisphere and increasing the importance of whole minded (right and left brain) thinking.<br /><br />The second half is focused on what Mr. Pink calls the six senses, aptitudes that are essential to compete in the conceptual age:  design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. A chapter is devoted for each aptitude.  At the end of each chapter a portfolio is provided with exercises and resources.<br /><br />A Whole New Mind is an intelligent, but simplified look at the changes coming in our future economy. It's raising an important flag in a world that still over values science and engineering, and looks down on the liberal arts.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked books one and two and of coarse you have to read book three. Was very confusing in the beginning, are they married, are they not. Couldn't tell. Then it was mostly the same old, same old. Wasn't surprised she ended up pregnant. Finally some excitement when the ex boss makes a reappearance. All in all I enjoyed the series and an glad I read them but am also glad I can move on to something else now.
B004BQVGHK|5.0|I collect these types of DVD's due to the detail and animation,to others who are collecting this type it is a great addition to your collection and can recommend it being on your \\"to get\\" list and is reasonably priced,(about middle of the road) so if you are on the fence at the moment it IS a worthwhile purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen the movie first and was anxious to read the book. I really enjoyed it even though I already knew the story line. It kept me wanting to know more about what happens to Peeta and Katniss. I'm already reading the 3rd book. I would definitely recommend this book.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|As a devoted Studio Ghibli fan, I was thrilled that I could order this dvd rather than wait for the movie's release in the U.S. in March '13.  This film is more in the reality-based Ghibli films such as \\"Only Yesterday\\".  While visually it is not as stunning as some of the studio's other work, it is still very beautiful and does not disappoint.  That along with the strong narrative, delightful humor, and depiction of life in Japan in the 1960s makes this a must see for Ghibli fans and everyone else who will become a Ghibli fan after seeing this movie.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|Just like most book to movie adaptations its just not that good. The whole movie is like a sprint. They take no time to explain anything. Rush rush rush. Its like the movie was made under the impression that everyone read the book. Surprising though Woody Harelson-Good  Not surprising Lenny Kravitz-Bad  A few of the characters didn't fit the bill by a mile but the main characters were pretty good. They changed up way too much of the original story for my liking. Including going for a friendly pg13 really threw a monkey wrench into it. Also the fact that they never visited their constant struggle of HUNGER in this movie is pretty mind boggling. Or how they barely scratched the surface of their struggles in the games. Well I could go on and on but I'll leave it with a 2 star cause lets face it, it ain't no Davinci Code or Angels and Demons and those just set a bar so high when it comes to book to movie stinkers they're pretty much the 1-0 star standard. The books are pretty good though and I'll still watch the rest of the movies but not at the theaters and it'll be a rent.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the best movie yet of this decade. It was a well written novel and now an awesome movie. Everyone needs to watch this film eventully  in time this might actually happen and f it does it will play out just like this great awesome amazing movie get it now!!!!!
1451626657|5.0|I served in the US Army, and what struck me about Catch 22 was that although this was an obvious satire, it was still so true.  Even the craziest parts of the book were no more crazy than the day to day life of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.<br />My dad has since passed, but we spent hours discussing this book, and he actually served in the Army Air Corps during the war.  But it doesn't matter.  Anyone who served in the military, and I think anyone who has worked in a large company can understand and appreciate Heller's work.<br />This book is part of our national psyche now, and it has to be in the top 10 American books of all time.

Together, they have written a very funny, clever book.<br />The question of what do the worker bees of good and evil think when Rapture approaches is not something I ever considered before, but it is a good question,  And when a devil and an angel like things the way they are, well, wacky things start happening.<br />I laughed regularly while reading this.  This is truly one of the funniest books I have ever read.

B0014I4KH6|4.0|The complaint here is that the jewel case for this CD arrived broken, with a small piece totally missing. Had it occurred during shipping the broken off piece would have been inside the padded envelope. Not so, which means an obviously damaged item was shipped to a customer. The CD itself was OK, so this situation is not worth the hassle of a return. I have many extra CD cases. It does indicate sloppy quality control to me. Otherwise, I would have rated this CD 5 stars, as I am a member of Taylor Nation, possibly the oldest.<br /><br />This album was cut when she was 16 years old. She wrote all the songs, and I am sure did most of the arraignments, beginning her fast rise on the way to becoming a self-made millionaire. I read through some of the complaints here -- Hey, lighten up, whiners. What would you expect a 16 year old girl to write songs about, anyway? She is one of the great songwriters; her target audience distracts the unaware from how truly great her lyrics really are.<br /><br />Kris Kristofferson said it all in an introduction at an award ceremony, her music speaks her truth. All you have to do is listen. Those critics of her voice itself should probably record themselves and publish on YouTube, so we'll all become enlightened.<br /><br />My advice is, if you don't get it, don't get it.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I have a fond memory of a few movies I've seen in my childhood and this is one of them, therefore I wanted my son to watch it.  There were several scenes I had forgotten, so I was thrilled to watch the movie again. It is really enchanting!

B000002O1Q|2.0|The \\"Sorcerer\\" track on this CD is nothing like the movie rendition. Completely different singer, different altogether and not even close. If that was one of your favorite moments in the movie and you want to capture it again, do not buy this CD. I rate the CD a 2 only because everything else on this CD seemed to be true to the movie's music. A bummer for me.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a plain and simple calculator that worked, I could get to it easily, looked good and worked on my kindle fire, well now I have! I love it, perfect! Thanks!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Great job with a grim tale. This is the sort of movie/book that I would probably never borrow or buy myself. After reading the description alone, I'd want to go climb in a hole for a day or two. Much less watch it. A friend recommended it. So I watched it with trepidation.<br /><br />Things I loved:<br />* no background music through most of the film<br />* authenticity<br />* no unnecessary dialogue<br />* critters, and their love of them<br />* the story and its execution<br />* the protagonist's perseverance and bravery<br />* the frontier feel<br /><br />Regarding authenticity, the characters looked the part. I think this is because some of them weren't actors and yet gave truth to the part. Also, the details such as the frayed clothes, home-made haircuts, crowded interiors, and so on.<br /><br />The frontier feel is from teaching the kids how to shoot, skin, and cook animals and other meals. Also, it is from the perseverance and harsh landscape and difficulty surviving.<br /><br />I just went with it, and could not help liking it very much, in spite of the despair. I will have to check out the author.<br /><br />This director should have won many awards, and the advertising and distribution should have been much better and wider. You need to see it. Or at least try it.
B004INNRFK|5.0|The show is greatly produced, with overwelming performers, unique in the world to have them all together one night in Vegas but at home, in your DVD. Don't miss this!!!!
B002ZCLH5S|2.0|So much more that they could have done with the \\"spaceship\\" and they end it with a really really cheesy scene.  Not only that, but it got off to a pretty slow start to begin with.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have read all three of the books, and I have too say, this movie truly brings alive the world of Hunger Games better than Suzanne Collins ever did. The action is enticing (and I think they made the shaky camera to keep the movie under R, because even with the camera the action gets very up-close-and-personal (even without the monologuing (YAAAAAAAY MONOLOGUIng!!!!!!!!!!!!!!))). The \\"emotional\\" scenes are played out interestingly, but im a boy so I laughed hysterically. It was an overall good movie, that was far better than the book (Suzanne Collins is not a very good writer, and whats the deal with writing in present tense), and it was great.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Poor acting by KStew. I love the other actors but saw the movies once do not have the desire to repeat the experience. KStew ruined this good movie. Charlize is awesome as always.  Heard there is a sequel but it's just going to be the huntsman.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the best adventure game I have ever played! They should make one based on the hunger games that would be so cool; since the hunger games has a lot of running and adventure to it the makers of temple run and temple run brave should really look into that.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is great and I love it so much except for when I go on aarcade mode and it says time up it always closes the app its sort of annoying
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the ability to change version on the fly. Great tool to have during study time or during service.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I really like the feel of these, most headphones hurt my head or ears, but these don't.  However after my first pair failed in the right ear, I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt.  Now on my second pair, and the right ear failed again!  I was happy with them the first time, but now I would NOT recommend these to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I just downloaded this app so I haven't gotten very far but so far it is hard to get the 4000 points to complete some of the mini games.  Some of them are really easy though.  Overall it is not bad.  They are pretty fun mini games.

B000HAEK4A|5.0|Started streaming this about 8 months ago, loved it.  When I started watching it there wasn't any CC.  Surprised to find that Amazon actually went back and encoded it with CC.  Much better now, when you are almost deaf it's frustrating not knowing what the dialogue is.  I bought the series DVDs, and they are great, but still stream now that CC has been enabled.  Easier than messing with the DVD.Great series, superb acting.  If you like Sci-fi, you'll like this.

B007MJSQSK|5.0|This movie was very different from anything I can think of.... It had SOO many twists and turns in the plot it was constantly keeping you guessing until the end! It was funny, fast paced and surprising. I thought it was very unique and worth the time & would recommend it if you want something different to watch!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app and its free. I like how the numbers are big. everything about calculator plus. is awesome
B0049P1VHS|3.0|The walking dead is one of my favorite tv series of all time. So I decided hey why not buy this? So I bought it and well the disc is fine but there are scratches and marks that were all over the case and disc. This was worth my money but I wish that the condition was better for what i paid for it.
0385534639|3.0|First let me say that the idea of this book was fantastic, and from the reviews i really thought i was in for an amazing read.  After about fifty pages or so i began to realize how wrong i was, but before i continue let me say this SPOILER ALERT & I didn't hate the book, i didn't care for first half of the book though the second half was much much better.<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />If you are reading beyond this point i don't want to read any complaints about spoilers.  If you use the audiobook, be prepared for the fact that the voices will blend together and his reading style can be a big dull.  I decided to switch from audio to book format about 10 pages or so in, which did make it more enjoyable.  The book starts off and at i had high expectations with comparisons to harry potter, hunger games and even water for elephants it was safe to say a few pages in i was very disappointed.  There is some violence in this book, but not like you would expect, the father Prospero the Enchanter or Hector Bowen as he is also called abuses his daughter repeatedly, breaking her wrist and slashing open her fingers so be prepared for that.  The point of view of this book changes constantly, which can be hard to follow and a couple chapters in you will find yourself asking what the hell is going on.  The many names for the same characters can be confusing as well. While i did like a beginning scene where Celia \\"also called Isabella\\" and Marco first meet, the book hopes around a great deal.  Some parts may have great detail others are just sort of rushed over.  The beginning seems like a never ending ramble. The beginning battle of the two characters which takes forever to begin is more of a game of one uping each other in a interesting but rather expected fashion.  When the term battle is used i like many thought they fought with magic, but that isn't the case at all!  There is no duels, but a serious of while amazing sort of boring displays of magic transformation, illusions and mirages.  However as the book progresses other characters begin to make it more interesting and by around half way threw or a little more the book becomes increasingly more interesting and kept me reading until the very end.  While i do think the beginning will be the stopping point for a great man readers i encourage you to keep going it will be worth it by the end. I also feel this is one of those books you have to read more then once to grasp all of it.  Le Cirque Des Reves \\"The circus of Dreams\\" is a very interesting place with some unusual people.  It is unlike any circus you have ever been too.....ages.

0142418471|5.0|Times have changed...and so has the state of young adult fiction. I can say unequivocally that a book like the fantastic Will Grayson, Will Grayson didn't exist when I was younger, but then again, very few young adult books were even written for boys, let alone books with gay characters in them. (Heaven forbid!)<br /><br />High school student Will Grayson is struggling to survive without making waves. Of course, given that his best friend is the very large--and very out--\\"Tiny\\" Cooper, avoiding making waves isn't too easy. He is attracted to his friend Jane, but is afraid to let her know or act on his feelings because it lessens the risk of getting hurt. But as the high school gears up for the performance of Tiny's autobiographical musical, Tiny Dancer (possibly the gayest musical ever), Will feels everything unraveling. And then one night, in the strangest of places, he meets another high school student, also named Will Grayson, who has come to meet a guy he has been chatting with over the internet. But the \\"other\\" Will Grayson's life is far more complicated.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. Narrated in alternating chapters by each Will Grayson, the story is funny, heartbreaking, hopeful and ultimately, amazingly memorable. It looks at relationships (romantic, platonic, even those with your parents), struggling to be happy, struggling with unhappiness, fear of rejection and breaking out of your shell, without ever being preachy or cloying. I read the entire book in one day and immediately fell in love with the characters. If I had any criticism, it's that I finished the book too quickly. I'd love to know what happened to the characters after the story ended.<br /><br />I only wish I had people like this--and books like this--in my life when I was growing up. Things might have been a little easier...
B003O86FMW|3.0|The Hunger Games was good...this was just ok. It was, in fact, almost the same story as the first installment just not told nearly as well. No character growth, only marginal movement in the storyline. Some parts were very boring and the 'exciting parts' just were not nearly as engaging as the first book. I'll finish the series to see how it ends. But the writing this time around was sub-par.
0439023521|5.0|It is the future, and the nation of Panem has arisen out of what was once North America. Panem is represented by a glorious Capitol, and the world Panem rules is divided into 12 Districts, each focused on a particular industry, like agriculture or coal mining. Those in power remind the citizens of Panem just how insignificant they are once a year, by forcing each District to choose one boy and one girl to represent it in the Hunger Games, a battle of survival televised to all citizens. The contestant who wins the Hunger Games spends the rest of their life as a celebrity to their District and all of Panem, while the other contestants meet their fate at the hands of one another.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old resident of District 12. She steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, and although she expects it to be a quick death sentence, she realizes she actually wants to survive, and win. But what she faces in the Games--both physically and emotionally--is far beyond anything she could imagine, because much like our own reality shows, the Capitol manipulates the circumstances of the Games.<br /><br />This book hooked me from the very start. While the creation of a new world out of the one we know isn't new, Collins' depiction of Katniss' life and the description of the circumstances around the Hunger Games is tremendously compelling. Having watched more than my share of reality shows and knowing how \\"real\\" they are, I still was captivated by the Games themselves. And while I had suspicions of how the story would unfold, I still was excited to finish the book. If I had any criticism of the book, it's that its main character was a 16-year-old girl, so some of the rationale behind Katniss' actions, and her reactions to situations, were a little childish, but this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a fun little puzzle game that I've been enjoying lately.  The puzzles tend towards the easy side though I just started.
0800177975|4.0|As you can read from other product reviews for this movie the good ratings are people who get the satire of the film and appreciate all the jokes. The people that  do NOT get the movie obviously gave it bad reviews, looking for something the film quite isn't. And I feel sorry for them that they were not well informed enough to know what the movie was before going in and seeing it or purchasing it or otherwise. Caveat Emptor.<br /><br />This is a good movie. It's solid, good movie, good stunts, and makes you think. It's hard to combine all that without being too pompous about itself.<br /><br />If you're an Arnie fan, watch it or get it, and if you've seen it already and can get what the movie is without having a hissy fit because you didn't know what was going on, enjoy it!
B00821OXNY|4.0|I purchased FALLING SKIES season one on Amazon Video and watched it over a weekend.  As a post apocalyptic series, it was pretty good.  The characters are strong and interesting, and there is a lot of action.  I have since followed the second season.  Recommended!
B007VT6QSI|3.0|Justin is an unbelievably talented kid. His first releases really dusted the possiblities with magic glitter but this present disc has all but removed the charm of his debut. I've yet to make it straight through this disc without moving on to something else. With each track I couldn't wait for it it to end. I've tried to listen and I can't even stomach it. There's no individuality to it. It sounds like all the rest of the \\"stuff\\" that's out there. If he was aiming to sound like his heroes, then he's a success. If he's aiming to be a stand-out artist, then the disc is a failure. It's not that it is bad; it is just unremarkable. And given the way that he came out of the gate with My World and 2.0, it is quite a let down. I'm not a casual listener. I think that JB is the real deal but this disc is predictable and trite. For a more interesting listen, check out Conor Maynard's Contrast cd as a better option. It's colorful and agressive. But this Bieber cd is ONLY for those who are his most devoted followers. Can't wait for the next one.
B005SJIP1E|5.0|Now that nearly everyone around the Amazon water cooler seems confident that this incredibly low-priced set incoroprates the much-lauded \\"Carnegie Hall\\" remasterings, I have to say, I'm so glad I puchased for it if only for the original jacket art included with each CD (now I hope no one is going to carp that the liner notes on the gate-fold CDs are missing..but the CDs are a bear to remove from the cardboard sleeves - a little too snug). Having this particular set is *almost* like owning the leather-boxed LP set of from the mid-70s. At that time (I was running a classical music record store at that time), the set was retailing for around $100 - a pretty astronomical amount for a clerk's salary even with my paltry discount! So I passed on it, but this set is pretty satisfying because it has the wonderful remasterings that I'm confident leave the original LPs in dust (without, admittedly, an A-B comparison), and supersedes the \\"Bernstein Century\\" releases. I'm only disappointed that it doesn't include the 2nd Symphony with the LSO and Janet Baker (I'll have to keep my \\"Bernstein Century\\" for that one including some duplication). I don't know why Bernstein was so enamored with Jennie Tourel. I understand she was a dear friend, but certainly there were more exciting mezzos available in New York at the time of the recording. It's a small cavaet: the sum is greater than the parts. As an addendum, I would suggest that anyone interested in Bernstein's Sony cycle and great performances, also purchase his 70s \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\". It is a beautiful performance and I would go so far as to say one of the great ones - and it is has been lovingly remastered. [[ASIN:B004ARZJG4 Mahler: Das Lied Von Der Erde]] - and new copies are available for under $5. Bravo Sony!

B005GHN2GG|4.0|Good group of characters with a developed story line. Romance scenes were thankfully not overdone. Also liked the cover a lot. Very happy to have read this book and would recommend it.
B004O2HAMG|5.0|A Simply incredible American epic, and a story of touching friendships.  I watch Lonesome Dove about once a year and it still moves me every time.  Duvall's Gus McCrae and Jones' Captain Call are two of the most compelling fictional characters in television history.  Masterfully written and acted, with a great score, I couldn't recommend it more highly.

B000000XB9|5.0|Totally awesome, great condition, and couldn't be happier!! Never thought it could be so easy and cost so little. What a deal!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book overall was great. It started a bit slow but not for long. A lot of twist and turns made it a entertaining ride. We rarely take place in the action togheter with Katniss tough. Most of the things that happens has already happened when we read it meaning that Katniss tells what she has done instead of us being with her when it happens.<br /><br />-----SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER-----SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER-----<br /><br />The ending was realistic, no one ever gets fully restored when one has suffered so much death as Katniss. It's okay that Gale went to 2 and Katniss and Peeta became a couple. That way Katniss can meet Gale again as friends later when his feelings for her are gone.<br /><br />The things that maked me literally pissed tough were how suddenly Prim died. Was that really necassary of the author? Katniss has suffered so much pain and when the sister she sacrificed her life for still dies... what!? I thought it was okay that finnick died but what about Annie? We didn't get much emotions from Katniss about Finnick's death either.<br /><br />But the main thing was how the author made Katniss into a whiny girl that in the end nearly accomplished nothing alone and how Finnick and her team died in vain. Yes, she made it into capitol, but only to see Prim die and then faint. So what did Katniss's team accomplish? NOTHING.<br />And how could she say \\"Yes\\" to a new round of Hunger Games? She totally throws away everything she ever stood for and Prim would never have wanted that.<br /><br />The whole series built up to the fight against Snow, but Katniss just fainted.<br /><br />I do not hate the book but it felt rushed. The end didn't do the series justice. A 100-200 pages extra would be enough to make it justice.<br /><br />-----SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER-----SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER------SPOILER-----<br /><br />If I have gotten something wrong here please comment back!

The set even includes the two Daria TV movies (although I would prefer that \\"Is It Fall Yet?\\" was on the disk with season 4, since it originally aired between season 4 and 5.

0765316994|5.0|This was a read-in-one-sitting book for me. Not because it was light, fluffy and undemanding, but because I felt compelled to not put it down.<br /><br />The premise is simple: 'Redshirts' begins as a piss-take on 'Star Trek', particularly that show's habit of killing off indiscriminately its nameless extras, or 'redshirts'. On the Starship Intrepid, don't go on away missions if you're an ensign or have just joined the crew; because while the captain and his elite are safe from harm, you're not. It's only when the book's main characters find out why this is happening that the author takes off in a completely different direction to what I was expecting.<br /><br />It becomes an examination of personal identity, responsibility, and whether or not we are truly in control of our own destiny. Throw in a couple of space battles, some excruciating death scenes, and characters that bring you along on their mission, and you have a science fiction novel that at the outset is a beach read, but once you dig deep into its pages, it is a lot more than that.<br /><br />'Redshirts' features three beautifully written codas at the end of the main story, one of which deals with an extraordinary case of writer's block. Taken in tandem with 23rd century mayhem, they offer a different perspective on what it means to 'be'.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This review is for the audio version.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.  I noted that some of the negative reviews found it boring and slow, but I feel that for such a sweeping work Follet had to set the context.  That being said, as a historian I appreciated and enjoyed what he did.<br /><br />Too, others described it as formulaic.  Personally, this doesn't bother me if the formula works.  In this instance, I believe it does.<br /><br />But as much as I enjoyed the writing, the reading by John Lee surpassed spectacular.  Accent, tempo, timing and nuance were really engaging.  Perhaps this is what carried me through those parts that others described as boring; frankly, likely because of Lee, there was not a single portion of this massive book that I found dull.<br /><br />I did note some minor historical inaccuracies that were distracting.  For instance, the Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle was a bolt-action weapon rather than a semi-automatic.  If Follet did enough research to find out what sort of weapon they used, he could have taken the time to describe it correctly.  There were other nits of this sort that were minor but nonetheless bothersome.<br /><br />Regardless, I'll be certain to buy the next volume in the series.  I especially hope that John Lee returns as the audio reader.
0785162348|5.0|If you're an Avengers fan or just a fan of movies and art in general, you'll love this book. It has in-depth descriptions and pictures of the characters, scenery, weapons, etc. and all of the concept art is FABULOUS. I was expecting this to be awesome, but I was blown away by just how beautiful the artwork was.<br />The timeline is really cool too, and helps you keep track of when all the events in the movies take place.<br />For over 200 pages of incredible art, this book is priced great. Totally worth every cent, and a must have for all Avengers fans!
B0016492BW|5.0|This is a great movie, perfect for the times when you just want to watch something different!  When I saw that it was out on Bluray I had to add it to my collection.  Some people might say that the transfer to Bluray doesn't do it justice, but I think that all depends on the watchers tv, audio setup, and so many other factors.  It looked and sounded great on my setup!  I would recommend this to anyone who likes some old school comedy every once in a while.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was so excited to read this book. I was hearing about it all over and how people read the book in one day because they couldn't put it down. It has taken me about a month to read this book. A lot of it is about sex, which I knew, but the story line isn't that great and it's very poorly written. I don't recommend this book.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, it kept me enthralled from start to finish.  There were surprises around every corner, which i love in a book.  It was written so well and an absolute pleasure to read, just started another of Gillian Flynn's books, hopefully i will love it as much as i did, Gone Girl !!!
034580404X|3.0|I don't no why the book is a best seller! Once you get started you need to read all there to find out the whole story plays out! The theme about grey and her search to find out his early childhood are repeated to many times, if you can speed read it's better.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this book because everyone else seemed to be! It's not usually what I would choose but I thought I'd broaden my horizons.  It was a mistake.  I'm going back to what I know.  It was poorly written, boring and doesn't make any sense.  I didn't find it exciting in the least and the storyline is so predictable, I don't feel the need to read any more of it! Save your money I say!!!

B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Wow! The acting in this movie was amazing.  Even though few words were spoken throughout the movie, I felt as though I watched and listened to an entire dialogue.  The unspoken and unheard became loud and clear.  The actors facial expressions and body motions moved with their lips and created a script that anybody could understand and enjoy.<br />This movie should be catalogued with the best classics.<br />What I liked most about the movie:<br />It was cerebral.<br />Every actor and every scene combined with great music to bring this movie to life (living color and sound).<br />It didn't need sophomorish bathroom humor to be funny.<br />It didn't need sex to be passionate and romantic.<br />It had many very memorable moments like the old time greats - Here's lookin' at you kid.<br />It didn't need words or sounds to hear and experience the action, love, tragedy and inspiration.<br />And, the dog was just as much of a character as any of the human actors in the movie.  The dog should be named Oscar.<br />I watched this alone, and like a good book I couldn't stop watching - even though I was tired and needed to go to bed.<br />I plan on watching it again, and I am going to insist that my girlfriend watch it with me - I know she'll love it.<br />If they made silent movies like this back in the beginning, it could have delayed the need for talkies.<br />From one armchair critic to another - watch it (you'll be glad you did).
0060512806|4.0|This book will appeal to people interested in World War II, cryptography, paranoia at the highest level, swash buckling adventures, the power of money, commerce, international communications networking; which probably covers 80% of the readers in the world.<br /><br />Unlike Stephenson's book called Snow Crash (Highly recommended)  this story is one in the present time with deep links back to the 1940's during World War II.<br /><br />The main characters are Bobby Shaftoe- a grunt in WW II Marines; Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - a cryptography and code geek at the highest level; Goto Dengo - a Japanese soldier who follows orders without question, any order;  Avi - super super paranoid genius and business person: Rudy - who ends up working for the Nazi's during WW II. Along with a large supporting cast of characters<br /><br />The bulk of the story revolves around creating and breaking codes during WW II and then extends beyond that as future off spring of the main characters run into each other when developing a data crypt in the Philippines, while looking for some long ago buried gold (literally tons of it).<br /><br />They intermingle and run into mostly bad guys along the way.<br /><br />Stephenson fully develops each character and we are privy to what they are thinking during various situations. The evolution of computers is blended into the story line as well.<br /><br />The various story arcs move along at a fast pace which is god as the book is over 1100 pages long.<br /><br />Recommended. I have Stephensons  ReaMd on my shelf to read and am looking forward to it based on the last two books I have read from this author.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty had already established himself as a rock star since the late 70s but his 1989 album Full Moon Fever was his commercial peak thanks to a series of hit singles including what is argubly his most popular song, \\"Free Fallin'\\". Other hits include \\"I Won't Back Down\\" and \\"Runnin' Down A Dream\\". Coming off the success of The Traveling Wilburys and deciding to make his first solo album without The Heartbreakers, although two members did contribute to this record, Full Moon Fever in my opinion was Petty's most mature record at that time. It was on constant rotation and its singles are still played on classic rock radio. The whole album is a gem, including one of my favorite Petty songs, \\"Depending On You\\". Also, the rock icon pays tribute to The Byrds with a cover of \\"I'll Feel A Whole Lot Better.\\"
B008OM0M4U|1.0|The movie was not funny--pure pro-Israel propoganda and aren't we just a little sick of that. Why didn't they make a movie about Netanyahu and Barak trying to dictate to the rest of the world about their slobbering infantile aggression that not only threatens the United States, the rest of the world, including Israel, and threatens to wreak havoc on the global economy. The movie, 'Dictator' might have been somewhat funny in 1972---and here I must emphasize the somewhat-- but it is certainly not funny today.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this. It works great on my kindle! No glitches...so far. Great way to relax s<br />after a busy day!
B0072AXGNY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book for a lot of reasons. First of all, Rollins uses reasonably well researched history, places, and theories as plot devices.  Unlike Dan Brown and his poorly researched \\"Da Vinci Code\\", Rollins actually gives very interesting factual data about the \\"Black Madonna\\" and the prophecies of St. Malachy, not to mention the Domesday Book and the Svalbard Seed vault.  Of course, what he does with this background is his own story, and it's a good one!  How he weaves history into a story about corporations gone bad, the evils of GMO, disappearing bees, is quite a feat! Kept me on the edge of my seat!<br /><br />Secondly, he doesn't pollute the book with a bunch of sex or profanity.  I was able to read the entire book without having my sensibilities assaulted.<br /><br />Obviously, it is action fantasy and the characters and action are a bit overdrawn, but that is all part of the fun of the story and background.  What's more, as I've already mentioned, you end up learning a few things about the real world.  What could be better than that?

0470638842|5.0|Eric Qualman, an experienced former internet marketer for some of the largest brands, brings to the forefront what every business should know- the importance of social media in today's modern economy. Socialnomics is a passionately written case for social media and shows how social networks have changed the business processes of production, marketing and selling. The book is also a call for companies that are steeped in the old ways of marketing and customer engagement to embrace the social media revolution.<br /><br />I am in complete agreement with the concepts proposed in this book. I was particularly interested in real economical impacts that social media has triggered. Being a social media user and book author, I can attest the fact that brands that are leveraging social media are more likely to capture their customers' attention. Social media has also made it possible for consumers to obtain products and service faster and to immediately give feedback about the products/ services from a brand.<br /><br />However, I wish Qualman had talked about the negative effects of social media and how this could also impact economics and social culture. He also seems to be of the opinion that traditional marketing may be as good as dead, yet the fact is that traditional marketing does have its place.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I just bought the bluray today and just finished watching the entire movie. Let me just tell you that the picture and sound quality are absolutely amazing! I guess we can't please the ones that gave it just one star, but it is what it is! You simply can't go wrong with this movie! I saw it again after many years and I was very impressed, need I say more!?

B005LAIHSG|2.0|... but that acting.  Wow, really really bad.  This was the first time I have seen Kristen Stewart and if I see her in a film again I won't bother.  Much like the John Carter lead, she was completely incapable of making me care one whit what happened to her.  After awhile I kept glancing at my watch to see how much more I had to take.  I wish they had picked someone who could act to play the role.  Theron did a pretty good job as well as the rest of the crew, but Stewart completely ruined the film.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Caught this at the late showing and was glad I did.  There are a few things I had issues with, but overall an entertaining film that is better by quite a bit compared to Aliens 3 and 4, though not as good as II or the masterpiece first film.<br /><br />The plotline is posted in wikipedia if you want to know what happens, but basically they find evidence of alien life through archeological digs in ~2080.  They convince a really old guy to build a starship to go to this world and find it.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with the film was similar to what I had with no. 2.  The crew of the ship is a bunch of misfits.  This old guy spends 1 trillion bucks to put this thing together, and he gets a bunch of hard drinking, mohawk wearing wackos to be his crew.  Similar to the marines in no. 2 - as if they found the flunkies from basic training instead of elite professionals to be the choice team to send on some multi-gazillion dollar mission.<br /><br />They get on the planet.. take off their helmets, and black goo from X files starts leaking all over the floor.  Gee... whats that?  Dead alien bodies everywhere... hmmmm... the air SMELLS good...<br /><br />Yadda yadda people die and turn into genetically modified monsters.. more people die and things start exploding.<br /><br />They also have the philosophical undertones of why are we here?  What is our purpose?  But at the end of the film it didn't seem to matter all that much.  The focal point was scary aliens and black goo and people splatting all over the screen.<br /><br />And thats why I give it four stars.  There are some good scenes with the engineers (the humanoid aliens) and the black goo.  The lead is pretty good and some of the rest of the characters (especially david - very well done by Fesbender) do a good job.  And overall when I walked out of the theater I was glad I saw it.  I may even buy it when it comes out.  Not 5 stars, but definitely better than most of the John Carterish trash that comes out during the summer.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|ordered this  movie for my son he loves the first one so i got him this on blu ray at a great price
B00785P2QC|4.0|best game ever I could play this all day. you don't have to wait hours for stuff to load or whatever like most app on here. every thing is quick and fast.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|This movie was ruined by the bad acting of Kristen Stewart. My wife and I both felt that way after seeing it at the theater. If they had a different Snow White this would have been a good movie. The scene where she gives a speech to rally the troops was the worst acting I have ever seen. She has no emotion. I wonder if she is a zombie? Charlize Theron was amazing as the evil queen and the rest of the cast was good but they can't overcome Kristen Stewart's poor acting. Save your money and buy anything else.
0756405890|5.0|Better to read a well-written book twice than read something mediocre once.  Mr. Rothfuss comes from the school of \\"show don't tell\\".<br /><br />Description of settings are lush, immersive. Characters are well-formed and believable.  Warning: if you are more of a plot/action person, you're going to think parts of it drag.

0307887448|5.0|Wade Watts is a delightful character. I was cheering for this plucky, resourceful, resilient kid the entire book.  The secondary characters - supporting and villains - were sparkling.  What makes any book or movie for me is the believability and quirkiness and well-roundedness of character.  Mr. Cline scored in that department.<br /><br />Since I spent my formative years in that strange cultural place in time called the 80s, the references were icing on the cake.<br /><br />The ultimate compliment:  I can't wait to read more from this author!
B002HNAAZ8|5.0|Amazing return to form for D2, an awesome hair band who never made it as big as they should have.<br />Great to have Ted back, as he is the voice of D2 (sorry Paul), and one of the outstanding voices of the genre.<br />There's a lot to like on this CD, from the big anthem \\"That's What I'm Talking About\\" to \\"Hearts on the Highway\\", to the classic D2 fun of \\"F.U.$\\", with its catchy, singalong chorus.  I also love the ballad \\"Fugitive\\", which some have cited as one of the weaker tracks.  Tremendous tune, with some heartfelt lyrics about relationships ending.<br />Saw these guys live a while back, and they KILLED.  My g/f said I was smiling the entire time-probably the most fun I've had at a show ever.  Ted was in great voice, and is a tremendous frontman.  I got a guitar pick from him. Rob Marcello is amazing, and seems like a genuinely nice guy.<br />If you like either the first D2 album or \\"Screw It\\", buy this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  I have it on my iphone and on my Kindle Fire.  I've had no problems with drag or anything else. It's just fun!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|I am a huge fan of the books! I read them all within a week and was so sad that I actually read them so quick. So when the movie came out I was one of the first to be at the movie theatre. I was disappointed with how they portrayed some things. I felt that they did not do the book justice. Now my husband who did not read the books really loved the movie. So that might be helpful for you to know...I will still go and see the next one when it comes out because I am just curious to see what they do with it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I don't know what 2 right but I see everybody else's reviews and that's freaking awesome. I'm looking foreword 2 playing it
B003SI1W3K|4.0|Great Movie. My eight year old son watched it several times. Great HD Quality through Prime Instant Video on my Vizio TV! Streaming was consistent and clear.
B000J103PC|2.0|As much as I love Meryl Streep, and I do love MS, I found this movie annoying.  It wasn't funny, and the plot was way too predictable.  I knew at the beginning that the very moral Andrea would be tempted to betray her friends for power and privilege, but in the end she would realize the error of her ways.  Streep's character was too unbelievably \\"evil\\".  With many comedies you are convinced to suspend your sense of the ridiculous if the movie is done well enough.  This never happened for me in this movie.  Perhaps some of my disdain has to do with the fact that I have no interest in, or tolerance for the high fashion industry.  I'd rather be frying trout on a campfire by a beautiful river.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game. fun and challenging keep it up disney. hope to see more like it. I'm gonna get crankeys story next.

0670023329|5.0|Quick and gripping read about a young man who escaped from a North Korean prison camp. What makes this book stand out from other similar stories (for example any memoir about the Holocaust) is that he was BORN in this camp, and until his mid-20s, it was all he ever knew.

I will say that this put women back in time as a sub servant to men. Although the story went on to be interesting in the second book and third it did not improve on the dark side of the story in my opinion.

0143123173|5.0|\\"The Cold Dish\\" of revenge is well-served in the first book of author Craig Johnson's \\"Walt Longmire Mystery\\" series. As the sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming, Walt Longmire has learned to keep his friends close, his enemies closer, and to keep a close eye on potentially unfriendly situations. A longtime lawman, Walt's law enforcement career actually began with his tour of duty in Vietnam. Also serving in Vietnam was Walt's lifelong friend, Henry Standing Bear, who now runs the local watering hole, The Red Pony. Walt and Henry go together like salt & pepper in a perfectly-seasoned recipe. Two strong individual characters, quite interesting on their own, but even better as a duo. The depth of their friendship is unspoken, but none-the-less keenly felt. That doesn't mean that they can't insult each other to infinity and beyond, which provides much of the laugh-out-loud humor in the book. Along with Walt and Henry, we meet a unique group of supporting characters like Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti, Walt's fast & foul-mouthed deputy. A former Philadelphia patrol cop from a long line of police officers, Vic moved to Wyoming along with her husband when he was transferred through his work as an engineer with a mining company. Vic, as loyal as she is loud in expressing her opinions, is also extremely competent, and in her own way, very caring. Rounding out the roster in the sheriff's office are Ruby, the capable and observant secretary/dispatcher; Ferg, the dutiful deputy; and Turk, more punk than policeman, and more attitude than ability. The setting itself, the stark, majestic beauty of the land, and the history of relationships between the settlers of the past and their modern-day descendants and the native Cheyenne is also an entity with a strong presence. Walt is the kind of detective whom I find most intriguing, flawed and fascinating, his keen intelligence expressed in his deductive reasoning skills and his wry humor. His interactions with the residents of the community, his love for his daughter, and his reflective grief over his wife's death are all important components of Walt Longmire. When a crime case from the past once again rears its ugly head, this time with murder as the result, prejudices and passions are combined in an explosive mix, one with devastating consequences. Author Craig Johnson writes with a sure sense of his people and their place, their ambitions and weaknesses, and the story line is consistently compelling. The conclusion is shattering--a stunning blow to the senses--yet we are ultimately left with the rekindling of the desire for life to continue and for laughter to reclaim its rightful rank. I was captivated by \\"The Cold Dish\\" from the very beginning, and it just got better as the story progressed. However, there was a turning point in the story line for me where Walt has to question a crime witness, a strange, alcohol-fueled, mule-riding man living in a decrepit cabin. The vivid word imagery of the scene and the interplay of dialogue between Walt and the surprisingly informative witness are simply superb, and a very good book then became a keeper. When you read \\"The Cold Dish\\", with my highest recommendation, you will discover exactly what I am talking about, and then, just like me, you will look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.is love for his daughter, and his reflective grief over his wife's death are all important components of Walt Longmire.

B004WPT3ZM|4.0|Megadeth sets the bar for any and all thrash metal with this killer album. Truly one of my all time favorites and a classic by anyone's standards. All tracks have a certain catch to them and it's ripping solos, crashing drums, and hot vocals the whole way through. Not much can be said that is bad about this album, it's loud, well remastered, and is a must for any thrash metal fan. It is hard not to headbang to any of these tracks, and even the cover song \\"I ain't superstitious\\" is truly phenomenal. My 4 star review comes not from this amazing album, but the inclusion of the live CD. I read a lot of reviews that said that the audio quality was bad. Still, I figured it couldn't be that bad, and I figured the few extra dollars spent on the Anniversary edition would give me a whole new Live album to love. If only I had listened to the reviews... The live CD literally sounds like Dave and the gang got together in Dave's mother's basement and started garage banding with a tape recorder. It sounds like it takes place in a low key bar, with very bad ambient effects and the quality is like a static cellular phone. I listened to it all the way though once just to prove the reviews wrong and convince myself it was worth the extra dollars, but it just isn't. Buy the album; it truly is astounding, and will be your new favorite metal album, but save those couple extra bucks you would spend on the anniversary edition for a rainy day, or put it towards another Megadeth album!

1568363842|5.0|This book came in the mail within 3 days ~ just in time for my Japanese adult ed class.  This is the textbook that was used for the class.

B008645YEE|5.0|I don't go to many movies, after all I am legally blind so if I want to `hear' a movie, I usually wait for the DVD release. But after the Aurora shootings, I don't know. I think I wanted to reaffirm my right to go freely, anywhere in this country, and not fear for my life or safety. So, I made it a point to take a cab and walk into that theater in Lake Oswego. It felt good, and I actually got a seat about five rows back from the screen, so I could actually see most of the film. I also felt somehow proud to, at least in my mind, confront the stigma this film had and has for a lot of people all because of one deranged monster in Aurora. Another good thing that came out of this is I was reviewing a catalog of books being offered for review and one of those books was published by The University Of Colorado Press, so I made it a point to write the editor and offer to review the book (you'll have to wait for the book review) and it was good to talk to someone who could still keep the beautiful things in the front of their mind after the tragic event.<br /><br />First thing that I noticed, almost naturally given my limited vision and my back ground as a musician and eclectic fan of many forms and genre of music was the sweep and drama in the sound track. Like the previous Dark Knight film, this one was scored by the Academy- Award® winning composer Hans Zimmer. He teamed writer/director Christopher Nolan to create the music for the final installment of his Dark Knight Trilogy.<br /><br />From the opening track, \\"A Storm Is Coming\\" it is apparent that this is no ordinary soundtrack. This isn't just pretty, sanitized sound to fill in the silent or transitory spaces in the action. As a musician, I could hear that Zimmer wasn't playing it safe. The music was daring and at the same time beautiful and masterfully composed as a \\"whole and necessary\\" part of the film. Nolan had this lesson he says he learned from working with Zimmer, \\"the real risk is in playing it safe,\\" and that is the beauty to be found in this album.<br /><br />Besides some breath taking music, and to aurally remember this fantastic film, I think owning this sound track is an effective way to honor the victims and survivors of the murders that happened in Aurora. A way  stand up to the fear that monsters like this generate. By overcoming that fear, we defeat the monsters and display the hero in all of us.<br /><br />The Dirty Lowdownt is the beauty to be found in this album.<br /><br />Besides some breath taking music, and to aurally remember this fantastic film, I think owning this sound track is an effective way to honor the victims and survivors of the murders that happened in Aurora.

0345803485|5.0|I've just finished listening to the audiobook of Fifty Shades of Grey.  The only thing I knew going into the book was that there was lots of sex and BDS&M.  But there was so much not said about the actual story so I decided to give it a try.  I glanced at some of the other reviews and have come to the conclusion that this book is not for people who are looking for a typical romance happy ending.  It's also not for people who have issues with control and expect perfection in book writing.  Maybe you have to have had your own emotional issues to really appreciate it.  This book is about a young woman and man who have never experienced any kind of real loving relationship.  She only knows relationships from books and he from a very messed up youth.  It's hard for me to find fault in either person.  You can see both try and make small steps in growing towards what's normal.  My view is that even though Christian has a long way to go you can see he loves her and tries to be what she wants.  If you disagree you only have to look at all the things he does that he has never experienced before her.  The fact that Ana willingly tries to do the things that he wants show her own growth.  However I'm irriated when she says she'll try but then blames him when she doesn't like it.  The ending was heart wrenching for me.  I could feel the pain from both of them.  I want to run out and get the other books but I'll wait until I can get the audiobook from the library.  Some of the reviews for the other books don't look nice but as with this book not everyone likes the same things so I will give them a try and hope that somehow in the end they can overcome their pasts and the two can find happiness together.

Even when he released his 2001 debut \\"Room For Squares\\", he was instantly pegged as a Dave Matthews clone. Not helping matters was the fact that his debut was produced by John Alagia- the same guy who also worked with the Dave Matthews Band. He decided to switch things up a little with his sophomore effort \\"Heavier Things\\", where his music was still the same in sound and production- except that he forgoed acoustic guitars for a more electric sound. Fast foward a few years later, when John made an attempt at making a soul music record with \\"Continuum\\". That album was his tribute to his favorite album at the time, D'Angelo's sophomore effort \\"Voodoo\\". He loved that album so much, that four of the session musicians that played on \\"Voodoo\\" (trumpeter Roy Hargrove, bassists Charlie Hunter and Pino Palladino as well as late guitarist Chalmers \\"Spanky\\" Alford) all appeared on \\"Continuum\\". He then followed it up with the underrated \\"Battle Studies\\", which picked up where the last recording had left off. After a three year hiatus, John returned with his latest release, the country flavored \\"Born And Raised\\".<br /><br />Joining him for the production of \\"Born And Raised\\" is the producer Don Was, who is best known for his work with Bonnie Raitt, The B-52's and The Rolling Stones. He starts the album off with the mild uptempo track \\"Queen Of California\\" in which he namechecks his musical influences. On the Celtic influenced ballad \\"Age Of Worry\\", he urges to those who are concerned with making mistakes to not be afraid of taking chances. He insists to put his bad days behind him on the first single \\"Shadow Days\\" and searches for musical inspiration on the acoustic ballad \\"Speak For Me\\". On \\"Something Like Olivia\\", He searches to find a woman who's similar to the one who he discovers is already taken. He sings of not wanting to be alone on the title track \\"Born And Raised\\", and sings from the perspective of a teenaged kid on \\"If I Ever Get Around To Living\\". He takes a less optimistic view on relationships on the bluesy \\"Love Is A Verb\\" and gets help from trumpeter Chris Botti on \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\\". He sings of wasting his time away on alcohol on \\"Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey\\" and falls madly in love in such a short time on the ballad \\"A Face To Call Home\\". While John Mayer's \\"Born And Raised\\" shows him stepping out of his comfort zone, deep down it's still the same old John under a new genre. The overall theme and sound is noticeably melahcholy, but it works well with the concept of the record. In short, it's an album that's actually pretty good.from the perspective of a teenaged kid on \\"If I Ever Get Around To Living\\".

B0034G4P9E|5.0|Much like Fighter, it is an emotional fighting film but Fighter had more comedy intertwined.  Warrior makes you jump out of your seat during the fight scenes, cheering on the two main characters in their struggle to win which inevitably brings them closer together.  Even manly men who watch this will ball there eyes out on more than one occasion.  Manly tears will most certainly be shed near the end and it will leave the audience speechless.  Truly an amazing film that I highly recommend to all.  You don't even have to be into MMA or fighting in general.  You will love this film nevertheless.

0671578855|4.0|Lord Miles Vorkosigan, no longer a mercenary commander, seems to be settling in nicely in his new career as the youngest Imperial Auditor -- and if you don't know what any of that means, then you need to go back to the beginning of the series because far too much history has already taken place for you to jump in here.<br /><br />In the previous volume, Miles and one of his colleagues solved a mystery and averted possible disaster on Komarr, the gateway world Barrayar captured for its own protection a generation before. And in the process, he lost his heart to a young woman -- now, conveniently, a widow -- who was a member of the minor Barrayaran aristocracy. Now they're all back on their own world and Miles is planning a campaign to win her hand. Her previous marriage was very unhappy and a great psychic strain, so he knows he has to give her time -- but, of course, romance and military strategy don't have much in common and Miles manages to get it all wrong.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his clone-brother, Mark, whose talents run to financial matters, not the military, is trying to set up a new enterprise involving human-food-producing insects that could be worth millions, . . . if only the little critters weren't so repulsive. Mark has his own romantic involvement, with one of the Koudelka sisters (who have been supporting players in the series for years now), but he's having problems getting her parents to take him seriously.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Emperor Gregor (with whom Miles has had a close personal relationship all his life, his father the Count having been Regent and then Prime Minister) is finally getting married, to a Komarran girl -- which is a great relief to Miles and his cousin, Ivan, because it will put more heirs between them and the throne. Anyway, security for the wedding, the first event of its kind in more than a century, is extremely high, which brings more problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the area of domestic politics, two of the key counts' districts are in danger of switching from the Progressive faction to the Conservative, and Miles becomes personally involved in both those matters, too, mostly because the other side was foolish enough to piss him off. (As Ivan notes, you really don't want to challenge Miles's ingenuity.)<br /><br />And there are several other supporting plot-lines, as well, all of which add up to a nicely complex and very enjoyable romp. In fact, it's very nearly light opera. Bujold subtitled this one \\"A Comedy of Biology and Manners,\\" and that pretty much nails it.cts are in danger of switching from the Progressive faction to the Conservative, and Miles becomes personally involved in both those matters, too, mostly because the other side was foolish enough to piss him off.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book because of all the hype. I figured if that many people liked it, it should at least be an ok read. I was surprised to find out it was so much more. The story line is fantastic. I must warn you though because if you read the first book, you will certainly want to read the others. So be prepared to buy all three books. They are all great!

1476712042|2.0|This is one of those books I was excited to read because I'd heard a lot of good things about it, that is, until someone compared it to 50 Shades. (I'm not a fan of those books for a multitude of reasons).<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me about this was the cover.  It's almost exactly the same as \\"A World Apart\\" which is just confusing to me.  I expect to duplicity from indie books but not from mainstream publishers.<br /><br />The story itself was alright but I felt like the relationship between Travis and Abbey was an unhealthy forgone conclusion. I found his anger issues to be scary and his overall behavior was borderline stalkerish.  I liked Abbey in the beginning when she was standing up for herself and while I understand the bad-boy pull, there's no way I'd allow a guy to treat me the way she allows Travis to treat her.<br /><br />I can see why people are comparing it to 50 Shades because it does seem like a watered down version minus all of the sexually explicit scenes.  Travis is controlling and overbearing and Abbey relents after deciding she can't live without him. Meh.<br /><br />This just wasn't the book for me.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This rating is not for the movie, but for the formats and product delivered.<br /><br />Multiple issues:<br /><br />1) No DVD format copy... Not as listed on the Amazon site (BluRay / DVD plus UltraViolet)!<br />2) UltraViolet \\"Digital Copy\\" (read: false advertising!) and Flixster FAIL, big time (You knew this last winter, why is it not fixed?)!<br /><br />Positive Note:<br /><br />1) Still a good movie, just can only watch it on BluRay instead of all of the formats I thought I had bought.<br />2) Amazon gave me a partial refund for not sending the combo with the DVD format.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />First of all, this package was advertised as a BluRay / DVD combo with the UltraViolet \\"Digital Copy\\" (more details on that below)... but where is my DVD copy?  I bought the package for the dual format so I could play the movie on my family's older DVD format devices... Amazon has agreed to give me a partial refund, since I opened the package before realizing there was no DVD format in the package.<br /><br />Now, I would like to claim my Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow Part 2 UltraViolet Digital Copy as some consolation maybe I can watch my movie when I'm traveling, but...<br /><br />First: I have to install another browser to support Flixster's lack of programming skill to even claim my movie code (Flixster is the method Warner Bros. used at their UltraViolet interface)?!  Since I use Safari, I get a blank page when trying to claim my code when I get to the Ultraviolet link, the FAQ says this is a known issue, workaround: make the consumer install a different browser?!  I guess I have to install Google Chrome on my Mac.<br /><br />Second: Flixster Collections (their movie download app) is listed as an UNIDENTIFIED developer with Apple... UNACCEPTABLE!  If this is what I should be using on my Mac, make the effort to show that you're legitimate Flixster!  They also recommend Adobe Air to do the downloads... At least Adobe is reliable and trustworthy... so I caninstall Adobe Air, we'll see if it works though.<br /><br />Third: The Flixster website is TERRIBLE to find anything useful for help or contact information!  Too many issues with trying to get this to work, and I know I'm not the only Mac user out there.<br /><br />I even installed Chrome on my iPhone to try and claim the movie there to work around installing another browser on my Mac... nope, have to claim it from a laptop or desktop!  The filxster.com formatting on the mobile device with Google Chrome is awful as well, doesn't even fit to the screen, have to pan around to see things!<br /><br />So now that I have downloaded Google Chrome AND Adobe Air on my Mac... now I am being asked to download Flixster Desktop App, just to download the movie... Isn't that what the Adobe Air was for!  Why should I have to install all of this junk on my computer to get to see the movie I paid for?!<br /><br />While I'm waiting to download the movie to my Mac (which is taking an exceedingly long time... over three hours to download), I will try to watch it from my iPad... What if I have internet issues?  Why can't I rewind more than 30 seconds at a time?  Why can't I fast forward or skip with a button?  I can do those things with the slider, give me some buttons. No subtitles, the BluRay disc it came with has them... By the way, the downloaded version is standard definition... Why not Hi Def? I bought the BluRay version didn't I?<br /><br />By the time I figured out how to get the accounts and various Apps and programs, gave them my personal info, installed them, downloaded the movie, uninstalled the excess junk off my Mac and was ready to play the movie, it was well over four hours after starting this adventure!<br /><br />Now I have it downloaded to my Mac and I can't play it through iTunes, again, no buttons other than pause, can use the slider, but can't pick chapters or scenes, no subtitles (I wanted to do this all of this on my computer, not a simple mobile App).  With iTunes I had those features, as if it was a disc playing in a player, just on my computer!  \\"Digital Copy\\" does not mean what it used to mean on packages... false advertising?<br /><br />Both my phone and my iPad already had the Flixster App as we use it frequently to look up movies in theaters and buy tickets... Great job on that, just the expansion to UltraViolet leaves MUCH to be desired!<br /><br />I will NOT be purchasing any more Warner Bros.' or any other studios' movies using UltraViolet copy (by the way it is not a \\"Digital Copy\\" which I used to be able to play in Windows Media Player and iTunes so stop with the false advertising).<br /><br />I will ONLY purchase digital copies through iTunes now.  Since this movie isn't in my iTunes collection, it probably won't even be worth it to watch, one more system to have to keep up with.... epic FAIL UltraViolet / DECE, Flixster and Warner Bros.!<br /><br />I have submitted complaints to both UV and Flixster and am waiting to see if they even respond.  I wish I would have read all of the review on UV earlier.  I usually don't read the reviews on movies, because I know what movies I want... now I'll have to check up on the formats too!<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for their help, as much as they could.  I think that they shouldn't carry the UV format until DECE gets their platform figured out though.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Dark Roots of Earth is an outstanding addition to a long history of superb albums by Testament. Yes the band is rolling forward and they don't even pause to look back! The new material is hard as diamonds and evokes plenty of dark imagery with solid musical production values in each and every track. It is great to see that Testament are as vital in 2012, as they were in 1991. Time has not weakened this band one little bit! Chuck roars on the vocals, and Alex delivers on the guitars. If you have ever been a fan of Testament, then this is an essential purchase for you. New fans of Metal will find plenty to like as well. I can think of no good reasons not to give Dark Roots of Earth a 5 star rating. Thrash Metal is alive & well in 2012.
B003L16FAE|5.0|As we are all aware of the fact that this isn't a brand new film by any means, but I will say it looks great on bluray in all respects except for the fact it lacks any extras which some people aren't too happy about! The only scene that I found to be blurry/below par was when Arnold starts slipping off the cliff and starts falling into the river. From the time he starts his fall the picture becomes VHS quality for a few seconds but as soon as he hits the water, we are back on track again! That is my only real criticizm of this disc, otherwise it is highly recommended compared to the dvd quality. The sound ofcourse rocks as well! You be the judge, I highly recommend the upgrade, otherwise!
B007IPJMCM|1.0|I am sick of these companies re-releasing and re-mastering already fine works. Most re-masters I've heard from heavy metal bands crank up the treble and low-end, effectively de-composing the bands' original sound. The only metal that needs to be re-mastered were our old Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath albums. Read the horrible reviews of the re-mastering of albums like Kill 'Em All vinyl edition, Cowboys From Hell, Cannibal Corpse The Bleeding, Deicide, etc. and you'll find this trend needs to be killed.<br /><br />As far as this new edition of Vulgar, it seems this was not remastered. Here is my gripe; Ever heard the \\"newly discovered\\" piss yet? It smells like it. Hollow is a strong track to end the album and (to companies listening) putting piss at the end of albums as \\"bonus\\" tracks sucks.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This lighthearted romance novel might be Sophie Kinsella's best yet! I didn't want the book to end! I heard that buying the print version was the way to go, because it includes footnotes that are easier to read in print than on the Kindle version (which includes them at the end of the chapter). I'm glad I knew about this ahead of time, or I would have bought the Kindle version. The footnotes are such a big part of the book, you don't want to miss out on them. Just a friendly tip. Hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Honestly I started watching this show because my favorite vacation spot is Covington Georgia and have friends there because of that.  On my last trip there I was told \\"you know they filmed heat of the night here and now they regularly film vampire diaries here\\" and then I saw some signs of the interstate.  I saw the 1st and 2nd seasons for 16 bucks so I said \\"hey, i like vampires\\" and wanted to see parts of covington.<br />Little did I know, this show rocks.  It sucked me right in.  Not only do I get a kick out of how they've put up signs to turn downtown covington into mystic falls virginia (but kept it the same except the cafes office buildings i believe). Its tamer than True Blood but this show is no Twilight.  Its an odd triangle between a girl who is apparently descendent from one of their girls from another time and the triangle that comes with her and 2 brothers one good, one evil.<br />Its a good show, especially if you like vampire shows.  They don't sparkle and is less \\"southern\\" than true blood with honestly less blood. Don't get me wrong though, its violent.  The show seems to open with violence and end in violence every time.  Im still not through season one but so far Im giving it a 5 star rating.  Im loving it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This television show is special. When I say special I mean, I am a 45 year old guy who's favorite movies happen to be zombie movies. This is something I never thought I would ever see. The show is frightening, compelling, gripping and a full on display of \\"the human condition\\" I have ever seen. So much of what is depicted is astonishingly graphic and yet you feel so much for the characters. I have watched all existing episodes more times than I am able to remember and I have found only a few continuity flaws and only one instance of bad plot design. I will say it's a sequence in season two's \\"Save The Last One\\". Why the walkers are mulling around in a slow swirl at the extremely evidenty abandoned Highschool where Shane and Otis go to get the needed supplies to allow Hershel to Save Carl.<br /><br />How about Shane stays in the truck and honks the horn, luring the walkers away and allowing Otis to enter the medical trailer get the supplies. Otis would already be waiting as Shane drove back after leading the walkers away.... just saying.

1423101502|5.0|Mostly, on a series, there is always a gigantic battle in the last book, where most of the characters die and it becomes all dramatic. \\"The last Olympian\\" is no exception either. Although it does follow the general \\"rules\\" of the fantasy series, it has a special ring to it, like as if it is somehow different from other books (just like Harry Potter). The idea of \\"demigods\\" and gods illustrated in the book is considered very original, creatively brought in to a fantasy by Riordan with real-life Greek mythologies and many other superstitions we might have just passed by. For the whole series, I really adored the effort our author has implemented in each book, and I just wasn't able to stop wandering what other myths will be put into action in the storyline.<br /><br />Percy was just enjoying his little free-time with Rachel when a Pegasus landed on Paul's Prius. He and Beckendorf then go on a sneaky mission to blow up the invasion force of Chronos in the \\"Princess Andromeda\\". There, the Titan lord sat waiting in the hall and insisted there was a spy in the camp. With plan jeopardized, Beckendorf suicides on a heroic death by detonating the charges planted on the ship and manage to delay the Titans plan. After his return to camp, Percy gets to hear the full length of the first \\"Great Prophecy\\", which of course, didn't improve his mood. Poseidon is at war with Oceanus, and the Great storm giant, Typhoon has finally awakened from his bonds. The gods are desperately trying to stop the giant, but the heroes know better: Chronos will be leading the invasion to Olympus soon, with gods busy and destroy their thrones of power, which will untie the gods from their power, when it will be in an easy state for the titans to get back to rule. Percy needs to defend Manhattan from hoards of monsters, and there are just not enough reinforcements to do so. Can Percy make it out? Or are the titans just going to resume the ruling after thousands of eons? READ to find out!
B007C9N4H8|5.0|Unless you've seen this movie before, it's way better than you expect! It's well produced, well photographed, well written and, most of all, very entertaining. Trouble is, the Muppets haven't been in the news lately and this movie didn't generate the public acclaim it deserved when it was released. But this is as good as the classic Muppets ever got--Kermit, Piggy and all that gang. The story picks up on that situation--that the Muppets have been off the front page for a while--and weaves it into a captivating story. You'll see all your favorite Muppet characters, even a new leading Muppet, and you'll enjoy a fresh new set of voices on the leads (Kermit, Piggy and others) that sounds just like the originals, maybe better. Wherever Muppet creator Jim Henson is now, he must be smiling!

B003K16PFU|4.0|As noted by other reviewer, Orwell did, in some cases, exaggerate or fictionalize portions of his journalistic writings and therefore it is difficult to categorize this book as the definitive book on the Spanish Civil War.  It is essentially accurate, with fictionalized accounts used by Orwell to enhance the dogma (which some call \\"truths\\" that he is wishing to portray.  (ASIN:0871404109 George Orwell: Diaries).  The book is a FANTASTIC read told from the disenchanted view of a man who once idealized communism and then found it just as corrupt as the other political movements and classes that he despised.  It is an excellent depiction of the grand ideals with which many men -- not just Englishmen, but also including leftist Americans -- volunteered for the war, only to be disillusioned when facing the realities of a civil war.  The essential feelings of disenchantment and the realities of the experience for many are compelling and more than worth the reading.
B000O77SOK|1.0|I would have rated this five stars because this was one of the best series on television. But like so many others, I don't want just one season.I want the entire set of eight seasons. When that's offered, I will buy it.<br /><br />The one star rating is for Fox and their silly marketing and ignoring their customers.

B007I2BZIE|2.0|I'm sure that most 5 starts reviews here are from die-hard Rush fans that would have given 5 starts to any album labeled \\"Rush\\", even if it had has sound of their farts. I had to be skeptical to them and read low rating reviews first before buying this album!<br />Where Rush found that \\"brilliant\\" sound producer? Did they listen to the complete result? Or they became deaf?<br />Quieter moments are passable, but as soon as the guys start play heavy metal, it turns to the WALL OF NOISE! Drums sound like they were recorded inside of a barrel. Cymbals almost absent in the record. Bass guitar parts cannot be heard.<br />Any garage band that has Apple laptop can make better sounding record now! This is shame for such a respectful and wealthy band as Rush to release music with so terrible sound quality! You guys couldn't find or afford better producer?<br />I'm not very picky in the sound quality department, but if I cannot hear the music how do I like or dislike it?<br />I gave it 2 starts for a couple of quieter songs I could listen and for the brilliant cover and insert designs. And naturally for Neil's lyrics.
0062124293|4.0|It is so nice to finally see a younger woman recognize that feminism should be valued positively.  For years, I've been dismayed to see younger woman balk at the word, yet take for granted so many of the 'freedoms' we boomers obtained through women's lib struggles.  Those struggles are not complete.  I am delighted that Moran has pointed out a number of behaviors women today engage in that undermine feminism and their own self-interest. A cursory review of any female fashion or celebrity magazine is enough to make one realize how far the struggle has yet to go.  She has addressed a number of these issues in her book.  I fear that U.S. readers will miss out on some of her commentary because of the extensive British slang throughout.  Also, her sheer intelligence and expansive vocabulary puts some of the language out of reach for the average reader. Of course, she emphasizes many of her points with profanity, which is not out of reach. It is unfortunate that she, like many comics, feel that this is necessary to gain and retain the audience's attention.  Moran herself is a bit of a puzzle.  The immature antics of her past are rather embarrassing to read and make her not an ideal role model, not that she aspires to be one. Maybe she seeks to be engaging, but the goofiness undermines her mission somewhat. Also it just is a little odd that a strident feminist married and had two children so young.  Yes, feminism is supposed to embrace all choices for women, but her opting for such traditional paths at a young age does make one question her priorities or at least her apparent anger at the status quo.
B0073XORCY|4.0|The album didn't disappoint me at all. Yes, Anderson has changed, but his lyrics and playing are still good enough for me to buy his records and go to his gigs.<br />Pros:<br />- excellent sound quality (unlike crappy-sounding latest Rush opus!) thanks to Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, the modern Alan Parsons<br />- well-designed artwork,<br />- quality of material: the album has quite a few really songs<br />- Anderson is in a good shape as a musician and singer.<br />Cons:<br />As the most modern records, it's a bit longer than it should be, so a few songs could have been dropped.<br />Dear musicians, squeezing as much music as you can into 70 mins CD doesn't make it better!<br />Besides, I don't like spoken intros to each song. Not a big deal, though,<br />Overall, the album is worth buying, even if you are not a die-hard Jethro Tull fun. It's solid and great sounding album that worth your money! And if you are JT fun and haven't bought it yet, what the heck are you waiting for?

I use it on a boat with Fugawi 4.5 nav software.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It held my interest and kept<br />me guessing throughout the entire book. It had many<br />surprizes. Just when I would think I had guessed and<br />figured out this book, it through me a curve! I really<br />enjoy that in a book!

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|An engaging story about a young women coming to peace with her life and reaching psychological maturity after her mother dies, her marriage ends, and her current boyfriend has introduced her to drugs.  The challengees of the PCT for a mostly unprepared hiker were outstanding.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Having just purchased and listened to the new Melody Gardot release I must say I was shocked at some of the critical reviews posted here on Amazon and, as a result, felt the need to address some of their points.<br /><br />First of all, for those of you who don't like the direction Melody went with this record, I respect your opinion.  However, all things being equal, it wasn't too far away from the Melody Gardot norm.  Sure it has the Brazilian vibe (which I, for one, love) but it's still sexy, smoky and freaking amazing.  I used to love Harry Connick Jr. (especailly his older stuff) but felt he had a tendency to stray too far off in various, unappealing directions.  No, this isn't a clone of her first few records.  But it's still a pretty impressive result.<br /><br />If I had one complaint it would be the number of songs and the resulting brevity of the record.  In the era of a CD holding 70 minutes worth of music it pains me to see 40 minutes of music.  I understand that in an era of downloading digital music it's likely more cost effective to release fewer songs but for those of us who still buy CDs and vinyl I would appreciate more music.<br /><br />Now, for the most important point of my review and an explanation of the title of my review.  I was shocked at the number of reviewers who were perplexed and stunned by a couple of things so elementary as a \\"hidden track\\" and the \\"retro\\" sound of a song playing as if it were on a turntable.  Both of these \\"tricks\\" are old and frankly, a little played out.  When I first heard a hidden track I thought it was pretty cool until I attempted to play my cd in \\"shuffle\\" mode and I'd have to wait anywhere from 5-10 minutes until the actual song started.  As a result, I was quickly bored by the concept of the hidden track and was glad when it met its demise (although obniously it's still got a pulse).  When I first heard a song on a CD and heard the hissing and crackling of a needle on a record, I was blown away.  As a fan of records over CDs and digital music I was thrilled when I could hear the wonderful hissing and crackling of a needle on a record.  The best part was not having to get up half way through to turn the record over.  I feel that today the \\"trick\\" of a song on a CD or digitally having the hissing of a needle on a record is also a little played out.  However, the sound of it will always put a smile on my face.  (Of note, there is an App for your smart phone that will play all your ditially downloaded songs as if they are on a turntable with all the hisses and cracks.  This shows you how popular this \\"trick\\" is.  At any rate, these tricks have been around for years (over a decade?).  For one person, much less numerous reviewers of this record, to not have any idea of either of those tricks is astounding.  Are you kidding me?<br /><br />Now, it seems as if everyone who reviewed this record is still a Melody Gardot fan and will not be leaving her camp which is a good thing.  If you don't like the direction of this records, no worries.  Listen to her older material and check out the YouTube videos of her older work and wait for her next record.  Me?  I'll listen to her entire catalog and will dig each on based on their own distince merits.<br /><br />Lastly, let's not forget about a pretty good singer named Francis Albert Sinatra and a record he made with Carlos Antonia Jobim.  Did anyone leave his camp after that decidedly different record?<br /><br />Love, peace and bacon grease...

B0073LJ61S|5.0|Not much to say here but David Lee bring the fun back to this band.The music is very tight from start to finish. Wolfgang is a great player but Michael Anthony's vocals are missed.As always Eddie and Alex bring the power rock we've come to know and love. As a drummer I was blown away by Alex. If they can hold this unit together I think they've got something here. Played it nice and loud in car and got the full effect. This is a very good if not great comeback record. Well done Van Halen, well done and fun.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|Andrea Bocelli held this concert in Tuscany, Italy to honour his home town.<br /><br />The show starts off with a breathtaking scenic tour of the place and proceeds into the outdoor venue which is equally picturesque. A stage set on a rock terrain with a pool of water- a conducive ambience for the show.<br /><br />Songs are chosen from Vivere - The Best Of Andrea Bocelli and performed with a star studded line up. Heather Headley, Kenny G, Lang Lang, Laura Pausini, Sarah Brightman, Elisa, Chris Botti and David Foster. Some guests like Lang Lang and Elisa did solos. Watch Lang Lang's fingers fly all over the piano! It's just marvellous! And Heather Headley has such an amazing voice and an equally beautiful personality - very warm and sincere in her delivery.<br /><br />A fine balance was struck between Bocelli's performances and those of his guest stars. The set came across as very cohesive and yet diverse with pop/classical elements.<br /><br />If you are curious about Bocelli's concerts, then Live In Tuscany is one of his best - a truly stirring performance!
B008ETOSYI|3.0|Besides the predictable joining of the protagonist with his lady love, the story line itself does not have the dramatic tension of other films of this type.  It is too predictable with the divorced husband not providing enough edge, enough to push against, for the love story to be anything other than ordinary.  Zac Efron has a gorgeous face and chiseled body as expected but not enough emotional range to carry his role successfully.  I enjoyed the landscape and the setting and, perhaps, a National Geographic special just showing the Louisiana countryside would have provided entertainment enough without this lame story.  Veterans especially deserve better.

B003VANOFY|2.0|1. Excellent for people who skype all day.<br />2. Software is a waste of time.<br />3. USB recharge port hard to connect.<br />4. Power button delay is really annoying.<br />5. Fragile construction - IT BROKE WITHIN A YEAR<br />6. Great intentions with this headset but it's not a finished product.SWITCH to turn these on and off.  It will drive you insane trying to hold the digital button and have the headset turn on sometimes but do nothing other times.  Plug and play.  The HD280 - plug it in, you get sound, end of story, win.<br /><br />Conclusion?  I will not buy the G930 again - not unless Logitech comes out with a Steel headband, more durable product, and much improved experience.  Cudos for trying though.  I would definitely buy the HD280's again.<br /><br />This is just my informed and experienced opinion.  If you have questions ask me.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Brutal bloody brawling. The the most amazing choreography since Ong Bak. A few reviewers have not truly understood what they're looking at. Many of these stunts have simply never been seen before. The combat imagination at work here is genius. What we have is extraordinarily difficult wireless stunts, and long mise-en-scene action celebration, without the mandatory Hollywood trappings. No love story. No politics. No three act straight jacket. No slow motion eyeball staring... no Matrix imitations.. no standing around waiting for a guy to get up. No faux Jet Li crouched landing poses.<br /><br />Some cops go to arrest a guy. He resists. Mayhem ensues.<br /><br />The Blu Ray transfer is beautiful. The sound of the firefights on a powered surround system is absolutely astounding. Revealing behind the scenes extras. A terrific value.<br /><br />Thank you, Gareth Evans, for the most intense, heart pounding, visceral action fest I've seen in a decade. You've renewed my faith.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|The Nikon LF-4 lens cap has a good fit, turns smoothly, and, unlike cheaper offerings, will go on the lens in any orientation.  Weirdly enough, I attempted to order several to replace some older/cheaper worn out caps, and my order quantity was capped at one.  It seems an unusual item to have an order cap on, forcing me to have to space them out through several orders.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Seventeen year-old Lola Nolan is nothing like me. She loves to create extravagant outfits that are absolutely unique in every way. She wears wigs in various colors of the rainbow. She has two dads and lives in San Francisco. She is dating a twenty-three year-old rock star wannabe and reluctantly pining for her next door neighbor. She in unconventional and dares to be different in almost every part of her life. Like I say, she is nothing like me, but ... I like her. I like her a lot. Throughout the story of Lola and the Boy Next Door I couldn't help but be drawn to her as a character. She wasn't perfect, but, as Cricket points out later in the novel, it is her imperfections that makes her perfect as a character. She could be vulnerable at times and extremely strong at others. I think that what I liked best about her as a character was that she was trying desperately to navigate the craziness that is the late teen years just like all of us did at one time or another. And she approaches her challenges with strength, and sometimes with tears. She sometimes makes the right choice, and other times she makes horrible mistakes. In other words, she was real to me. And I appreciate lead characters in books who make me see a bit of myself in them, even if they are colorful budding designers with a flair for the dramatic.<br /><br />As for the romance of this book. ... I have to say that I have come to really love the way that Stephanie Perkins writes her YA romances. The pacing of the relationships can be halting at times, but that is much like I might see in an everyday sort of teenage relationship. It is the halting nature of the relationship that keeps me on the edge of my seat as I read, hoping that the two people involved can see what I see and find a way to move forward. This book is the same. Cricket (yes, that really is his name ... and I don't think it is ever explained where that name came from) ... but Cricket is the love interest of Lola, her next door neighbor. I really loved him. He was a bit geeky. He was an inventor, and he was not the smoothest guy when it came to romantic relationships. His actions were so often hasty and messy or simply withheld because of fear. But I could never deny the passion he felt in his actions. It was obvious that he liked Lola a lot. The mystery was in how he was going to find a way to win her over ... even though it was obvious that she liked him equally. Some of the scenes between the two of them, especially toward the end of the novel, we the kind of scenes that you finish and just breath a long, sustained \\"awwwwww[...]\\" He was/is such a sweetheart.<br /><br />And, by the way, Anna and St. Clair from Anna and the French Kiss are characters in this book, so it was lots of fun to see them as secondary characters. I still really love St. Clair, so it was great to get to see a continuation of their story, although in this one they are the seasoned couple with all the solid relationship know-how.<br /><br />So this is yet another winning novel by Stephanie Perkins. I look forward to reading the third and final book in this series of books. Her writing style really appeals to me. Another five star book!really loved him. He was a bit geeky.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very simple interface, very convenient for everyday life. It doesn't have a &radic;-key or x&sup2;-key, but in everyday life, how often does that pop up? Af far as the %-key is concerned, I find it to be very intuitive that it shows you exactly what it did so that you're not hoping that it did what you wanted. Also, the fact that a mistake can be easily backspaced is very convenient, as well. All in all, if you are looking for a simple, easy-to-use calculator, this is it.
0812993292|4.0|There is nothing worse in life than regret.  To look back on one's past and see failure is one of the most heartbreaking emotions a human can experience.  We can cope with death, loss and hurt, knowing that we did all we could to avoid them, but failure due to our own choices is something unbearable to recognize and remember.  Harold Fry, awakened from his dull existence by the unexpected delivery of a letter from a long-forgotten friend, knows this very well.  The letter, sent by a woman dying of terminal cancer, reminds him of all the ways he has failed in life: as a son, a husband, a father and a friend.  Penning and attempting to send the response to the letter that has opened this rift in his heart sends Harold instead on a remarkable journey of self-discovery and awakening.  A brief conversation with a young girl at a filling station inspires Harold to walk the six hundred miles from his home in southwestern England to the hospice at the northeastern tip of England, signifying his faith that his friend will be healed and live, at least until he has a chance to apologize for his past.  Though woefully unequipped for this arduous trek, Harold slogs on, reinforced by his encounters with people along the way.  He experiences moments of overwhelming depression and glimpses of unbearable joy, coming to realize essential truths about humanity, compassion, forgiveness and love.  As his journey progresses, Harold's memories of his life are gradually re-awakened and we learn of the reasons he believes himself a failure.  Will he find redemption for that failure at the novel's close?  Or will he fail, too, in this final attempt at faith and forgiveness?<br /><br />I am torn about this book.  It is beautifully written and evocative, uplifting at times and profoundly sad at others.  The descriptions of Harold's journey, his blossoming appreciation of the world around him, his grasp of human nature and his bouts of confusion and discouragement are poignant and heart-wrenching.  The characters he meets are mostly sketches but his evaluation of them and incorporation of their stories into his own heart are what makes them each touching.  However, parts of the book are extremely slow and felt unnecessarily drawn out or contrived.  But the ending brought such a sense of closure and hope that I couldn't help but close the book with a smile and a feeling of pleasure.  Though I didn't enjoy it as much as other books to which it is compared, I do believe it's a worthwhile read for anyone wanting to be reminded of what it means to be human, to care for others and to learn to forgive and be forgiven.ng.

B007SGM084|5.0|While I had heard all the hype about these books, what I was surprised by was how well written they were. The sexual exploitations while graphic and hence very steamy also allow you to feel as though you are part of the characters and were thereby exciting. They made you question your own sexual experiences and made thought provoking questions as to whether you wanted more out of your own sexual encounters; perhaps not to the same degree but your willingness to experiment a little out of your comfort zone.  What I found surreal was the constant need for sexual gratification at every turn.  I was totally absorbed by the characters and learned more about the domination and s/m culture than I had known in the past.  While Christian is not such a likeable character in book one, his transformations in books two and three and the reasons that shape his character are captivating and give meaning to him. His tenderness and caring for his staff also showed his sensitive side.  I loved Anastasia's character, strong will and personality.  Her ability to yield but not forfeit her character and values seemed real and was the gift that Grey needs to become 'more human' and sensitive.  The author's continuation of the story with a suspense of what happens next at the end of each book forces the reader from one book to the other. While I enjoyed the ending you could see it was somewhat predictable but does close the trilogy nicely. Can actually see Tatum Channing as Grey and Anne Hathaway as Anastasia if there is a movie!

0345803485|1.0|I read pretty much anything and it's very rare for me to not finish a book.  I'm not sure what the hype is all about for this series, but I couldn't finish the first book.  I read the first five chapters and kept hoping the book would get better...it didn't.  I just couldn't finish it and I haven't felt the need to pick it back up and try again.  I haven't felt this way about a book since the Twilight series and I did finish the first book in that series.  Sorry, this book was not worth the $$ spent a all!
B004RPKR34|5.0|After reading this book, I really believe Gary Chapman is on to something.  This could really make a difference in our relationships - understanding not only what makes us feel loved, but also recognizing what makes other people feel appreciated and, perhaps, loved.

0345803485|5.0|I was \\"peer-pressured\\" into reading these books by friends whose tastes are quite lofty - English teachers, professionals,  highly educated people, who don't even succumb to the occasional chick lit as I admittedly do. When I finally succumbed, I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />Those of you who have criticized the book for being poorly written, weak in plot, predictable, rambling, nonsensical....puhleese, it's chick lit. If you are holding it to higher standards then the joke's on you. Aside from the issues with BDSM, which I won't address - what woman would not want to have the love an adoration of a gorgeous, wealthy, talented man - one who is flawed, who we think we can \\"fix?\\" That is what chick lit is made from.<br /><br />I was shocked when I finished the books and came here to read the reviews (I always feel like it's a fun book club) - really, this is not something to be taken so seriously. It's just a creative romance. Get over it, and please don't read the Shopaholic books! Now, I am going to review In the Garden of Beasts, with the appropriate reverence and frame of reference. Ay yi yi.<br /><br />Great fun, keep the expectations where they need to be. Like getting caught up in who should play the hunk in the film. Will see it with girlfriends.

It really feels like you've spent a year of your life in Gotham and have collected the ultimate Batman set of collectibles. Where did they find all this stuff?

159514188X|1.0|You gotta love a book that essentially gives you permission to kill yourself. Hannah gets everything she ever wanted by taking her own life, which is just a wonderful message for a book to have, isn't it?<br /><br />Replete with overwrought dialogue, manipulative and artificial scenes and characters, and driving home the message that killing yourself will get everyone's attention and \\"Then you'll see! Just wait, just wait! I'll kill myself and you'll know how awful you are,\\" Thirteen Reasons Why is a book that deserves to be ignored.<br /><br />There are other, far better books out there that better deliver the message that our behavior affects others and we need to treat people with respect, sensitivity, and compassion.

B007STBUIW|5.0|I have been a fan of this film since I was a child in the summer of '75. When home video came out, this was the first videotape I bought. It just wasn't the same movie until Laserdisc introduced us to Speilberg's widescreen version. Now that's the movie I remember! DVDs would come along over the years and now blu ray. This blu ray is like seeing the movie through new eyes. I have NEVER seen this film look so beautiful. The colors are finally what they need to be and not dull like the past releases. My jaw (no pun) dropped when you can finally see the detail of the night opening shot. All the versions in the past were way too dark where you could barely see a thing. That was just the opening! Rest of this masterpiece looks just as brilliant. This is the version we fans have been waiting for! I am so glad Universal waited until their 100th Anniversary to properly restore this classic and not just upgrade an old faded print from years past. I fell in love with this brilliant movie all over again! Even if you have an old copy of Jaws on DVD, do yourself (and your eyes and ears) the favor by upgrading. If not the blu ray, get the newest 100th Anniversary DVD. Better yet, if you don't have blu ray yet let this title be the one that gets you on the hi def bandwagon.<br />If Speilberg were to do a commentary, I wished it would be this breakout film for him. But really, this great film doesn't need much explaining. We have these great documentaries on this blu ray for that.<br />I had to break down and get the one with the book on it. And glad I did!

B007STBUIW|4.0|Jaws is fantastic!  Wow!  I was so thrilled by the idea of a shark feeding on humans!  I think that's wonderful!  The best part was when that shark fed on that human!  What a feeding!  I saw this movie when I was an embryo, and it still excites me to this day!  After I saw it, I immediately wanted to go into the ocean and become a feeding for a great white shark!  The blood and gore and graphic depiction of human flesh being torn apart and swallowed by a large shark was first rate.  Some poeple say this movie glorifies the violent nature of shark feeding, but I think it is a wonderful, natural process which is part of the whole balance of nature.  It's \\"responsible violence\\", unlike some of Spielberg's later films. I myself have been a shark meal over eight times!  Being eaten by a shark was the best thing that ever happened to me!  It amazes me that Spielberg, who had never been eaten by a shark, has given us such a human-eye perspective on being fed upon.  He should be eaten, just like his characters.  I love this movie!  You know, when the shark fed on that human, it was stunning!  And the best part was that you didn't know what was going to happen!  I mean, you're sitting here, watching this nice movie, and then BAM!  A shark comes out of nowhere and feeds on this human!  I mean, how random!  How did Peter Benchley think of that?  It was so thrilling that, i believed, the next time in the movie that the shark fed on another human, I wouldn't be as excited.  But I was!  There is no shortage of shark feedings here, and that's what makes a good movie.  I mean, look at Armageddon!  NO SHARK FEEDINGS. Bad movie.  Buy this DVD, for all your shark feeding needs.  This movie also has a large sense of comic relief.  There's this part where this human is fed upon by a shark, and then it cuts to another shot, and Brody and Richard Dreyfuss' character are getting drunk.  Funny!  Then they go out on their boat, and they uncover another shark-fed-upon human.  Laugh out loud!Spielberg truly develops his characters in this cinematic masterpiece.  In another part of the movie, the shark feeds on this human, and you can really feel the hunger of the shark and his need to consume food.  Anyway, I saw Deep Blue Sea, and I hated it.  Lots of sharks feeding on humans, but the acting sucked.  See JAWS!  It is the ultimate shark movie!  In fact, of all the shark movies ever made, I would have to say that JAWS is number one!  It's so good that I'd say it's better than all the other shark movies.  In fact, no other shark movie comes close to matching the brilliance of JAWS.  If you like sharks feeding on humans, rent JAWS.  It's #1!  (see my review on \\"Out Of Africa\\".)

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am not a fan of Apple. I have never bought any of their products, and I have never thought much about Steve Jobs even though I grew up a child of the 80's and 90's. I have always been a PC user and now use Android. I find it fascinating that Apple considered itself the \\"good guys\\" when comparing itself to Microsoft, IBM, and these days Google. While I do believe the quality of a product can be higher when you are controlling the end to end experience, I never agreed that they should be the ones deciding what you should do with the item you purchased. Apple tells you how you are going to use their product and you either take it or leave it. When Steve Jobs didn't like Adobe Flash, he didn't put it on Apple products. He made a choice that was yours to make, not his. Apple put out the iconic \\"1984\\" ad basically saying Apple was going against the establishment, but to me they were the ultimate example of control and that has made me uninterested in buying their products in the past.<br /><br />I still find myself fascinated by the life of Steve Jobs now that I'm a little older and that's what made me finally decide to purchase the book. Steve was a very unique individual, and that's both a good and bad thing. In some areas he was definitely a genius. I would also say he was eccentric and a narcissist. If you read about many very intelligent people throughout history there were often dark sides to them almost as if the unique aspects of their minds had to be balanced by issues in other areas. Some say Jobs was a functioning psychopath. I have no idea if I would go that far, but its obvious from reading the book that while he was very good at what he did, something was also kind of off. I cant logically make sense of an intelligent person like him falling for so much nonsense when it came to food and dieting like he did.<br /><br />The biggest issue is, not surprisingly, the way he treated people. Years ago I would have condemned Jobs, but my own experiences in life have caused me to have mixed opinions now. How successful would Apple have been if Jobs did not act the way he did? We can only guess, but I'd be willing to bet good money not as successful as it turned out to be. I had the displeasure of working for an executive that was truly ignorant and arrogant towards the people below him. I left the company because I would not treat my people that way and do not agree with it, but I also believe that you cant always be the nice guy if you want to truly be successful. Yes, I do believe Steve Jobs went over the edge with this at times, and I could never be like him, but accountability is important, and when you are just the nice guy people take advantage of you or don't take situations as seriously as they should. Steve didn't accept less than the best and he was very brutally honest about it with the people around him. These days I feel like there is a little bit of Steve's style in the way I do things and that is ok. There needs to be balance in all things, but for Steve everything was very black and white and that pushed him to extremes most people would not feel comfortable using in their own lives.<br /><br />I have read many of the one and two star reviews and find myself disagreeing with some of the points made in those reviews. I don't see the book as being all negative and avoiding the good things about Steve's life. It just stated things as they were. Intelligent people can put the pieces together and each of us has to come to our own conclusions after reading the book. He accomplished some amazing things in his life and he seemed to truly enjoy what he did. On the other hand, most of his life he was not a great family man, and he was not that great to the people around him which has brought out some extreme opinions from those who worked with him. I didn't read the book and think wow this guy was a horrible person. I actually have a better opinion of Steve and Apple after reading the book. I may even buy one of their products after reading the book. He was an imperfect person in many ways, but he also accomplished things that most of us can only ever dream of. I now wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him and really see what he was like and learn from him.<br /><br />I did find a few things about the book a little weak. Like some other reviewers, I do think the book should have gone chronologically more and bounced around less. It just seemed to skip over some things or barely mention them and a couple of times a first name would be mentioned and I wasn't sure who it was and found myself going backwards trying to figure out if the person was mentioned before. I also agree that the style of the book changed when I made it to the last 20% or so, as if they were in a rush to release the book after his death. I would like to have seen more thoughts from Jobs near the end and more from his family, though I do agree with how the book ended. At first it seemed kind of odd and I expected more, but ending it at the point Isaacson last visited with Jobs was actually the most respectful ending he could have given.<br /><br />Overall the book is very good and will leave you deep in contemplation once you are done as to what kind of person Steve Jobs really was. The good and the bad. The extremes in his life and how he dealt with people in general. Again, I finished the book and came away with a greater respect for Steve Jobs, and I think if you can read between the lines a bit and really spend some time thinking about what you read, you will also come away having some different thoughts regardless of whether you like or dislike Jobs or Apple. The book may not be perfect, and we are only spectators who were not a part of Jobs life, but the book accomplished what it needed to, and the overall experience combined both sides of Jobs into something dignified. That's all it needed to do.oducts after reading the book. He was an imperfect person in many ways, but he also accomplished things that most of us can only ever dream of.

B008ANFRG6|5.0|This great album by Steve seems to get fresher after each listen. The guitar playing is pure Steve Vai, the way only he can make it speak and express itself in tones of beauty. I highly recommend the DELUXE PACKAGE. With this you get a bonus dvd which Steve breaks each song down and explains the meaning behing each track. With this you can really see this beautiful work unfold itself. Everything starts to come together and with this comes an understanding of a work that some listeners brush off as \\"out there\\". I have come to really, really enjoy this album each time. There are so many new sounds and phrasing to discover with every re-listen. It just keeps on giving.<br /><br />My two favorite tracks on the album are \\"The Moon and I\\" & \\"Weeping China Doll\\". Pure Steve Vai. Pure emotional playing. FANTASTIC GUITAR WORK. If you watch the dvd and listen to Steve explain the story behind \\"Weeping China Doll\\", it makes the song even more beautifully bizarre. You can't make this stuff up. You got to hear it for yourself. Even without the dvd, this work will stand up on its own merits. It is simply a beautiful experience and a great gift from the most versatile and emotionally tonal player on the planet.<br /><br />All in all, a worthy effort to continue on the \\"Real Illusions\\" trilogy. This is an incredible album that only gets more beautiful with each listen. If you are thinking of spending time with \\"The Story of Light\\", spend the few extra and get the bonus dvd. Make it an experience!!!!

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I really don't know where to begin with this review... Gerard Butler was an excellent Phantom. I know he wasn't the best singer, or the fact that his deformity merely looked like a sunburn gone wrong, but you all have to remember Gerry is not a trained singer; he's an actor. His acting was great! He was my first Phantom and I fell in love with him the minute he sang \\"The Music of the Night\\". Yes he's no Ramin Karimloo (My favourite Phantom), he's not a Michael Crawford, or a John Owen-Jones (My other fave Phantom) but Gerry posses his own unique style. Andrew Lloyd Webber said he wanted a Phantom with a more Rockish style to his voice, and Gerry fit the part well. Sure they sexified this deformed maniac, but I do believe it was also to appeal to us younger girls who love the dangerous, mysterious, yet sexy man. Emmy Rossum was a good Chrisine, she had that youthful voice and I  think her acting was good too, not great, but good. Patrick Wilson was great as Raoul, he seemed to understand the character. His voice was lovely to listen too, it was soft, soothing, just like Raoul's voice should be. The only thing that bugged me about Raoul was that stupid wig! I think Raoul should have shorter hair, but that's merely my opinion. The music itself was astounding like it should be. The only con was that they didn't have \\"Notes II\\" or \\"A Rehearsal For Don Juan\\" in the movie. I think in \\"Notes II\\" they show that Christine does have a spine on her back. The way she sticks up for herself, shows that even she does have a breaking point. (Hints: Christine gets angry with Carlotta, and overwhelmed in \\"Notes II\\"). In \\"A Rehearsal  For Don Juan\\"....well why even skip this song? It has humor in it. I don't know about you, but I get a giggle and a good laugh when I hear Piangi trying to sing \\"tangle\\"... Overall the sets and costumes were amazing, though I do question Christine's \\"Nightgown\\". I prefer the one on the show better. Anyways, having two copies of the single disk version, Ithought that the third time was the charm and I needed an upgrade. I got the two disc edition because I wanted to see the behind the scenes and other footage from the movie. (Also to complete my Phantom movie collection with: Love Never Dies, Phantom 25th Anniversary, Phantom (Charles Dance 1990 version). I would suggest maybe renting before buying if your skeptical still. But if you're a die-hard Phantom \\"Phan\\" like me.....buy it and \\"Listen to the Music of the Night\\". (Review done by an 18 year old's perspective.)

B0084IG8TM|5.0|Overall, an excellent film. The production is first rate, as is the cast. Jennifer Lawrence is able to continue on with the same type of strong, protective character that she so mastered in \\"Winter's Bone\\". Without her, the movie would not be the same.<br />Given the star-crossed lover theme that's a part of the movie, I can't help but wonder how many recognized the first four notes of the love song from Zeffirelli's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", in Katniss's mockingjay whistle code to Rue in the forest.

030788743X|5.0|I loved this book!<br />Mind you, it's not perfect and it is not a literary masterpiece but it is definitely an engaging and captivating read especially if you were, like me, a geek/nerd who grew up in the 80s with bread and video games!<br /><br />If not, you should still find enjoyment in learning about the games and pop culture your dad grew up with and how it may affect the forging of the future ahead of us. Interestingly, with new VR devices on the horizon, that future might actually getting closer: it's a funny coincidence how the OASIS (the VR system in the book) was launched in December 2012, exactly the date that the Oculus Rift dev kits (the latest VR project getting funded on Kickstarter while I write this) are going to be released! Ok, I'm digressing. Let's go back to the book.<br />Several negative reviews are centered on the stereotypes of some characters, mostly about the Japanese duo. Indeed there are sterotypes here and there but if none of my Japanese friends who read the book found them offensive and prevented them to enjoy the engrossing story, why should we?<br /><br />Looking forward to the movie adaptation (hoping they won't mess it up as they did with the Hunger Games! ops, I'm digressing again!)!<br /><br />In the end, Read. This. Book!!

B00007DWRA|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the late 1990's and knew that I must see it again. This is a fantastic story of the life of an individual who was passionate about music, and the more important things in life and lifestyle. Extremely enjoyable, beautifully acted, and a movie I know I will enjoy over and over again.
B007R9MFPU|2.0|I just don't get some of the reviews here. Ultravox was one of my favorite 80s bands, and I will never forget the first song of theirs I heard (\\"Sleepwalk\\" on their masterpiece Vienna). This release doesn't hold a candle to any of their previous efforts and has some of the most boring, sappy songs they have ever written. Yes, there are several cuts that could make some of their previous releases but over I am very disappointed this is all they could come up with after all these years.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|There isn't enough that I can say about this album!  After purchasing the three previous studio releases strictly out of curiosity and the obligation of a fan boy, I was pretty convinced that Rush was a spent force whose most creative years were behind them.  However, like most everyone else, I was surprised at the quality of this album.  This album is a culmination of a band that has continually experimented with different arrangements, musical styles, and instrumentation over their four decade history.  Boy, does it deliver!!<br /><br />First off, this album isn't going to please every fan (as some of these other reviews indicate) - any band that has recorded different sounding albums as Rush has is going to alienate SOMEBODY with anything they attempt after 40 years.  However, it is as close to a definitive Rush album as anyone can expect.  Playing with their typical tight virtuosity and augmenting it with their strongest melodies in 30 years and a degree of playfulness normally reserved for their live shows, Rush have found the balance that many of their older fans (like me) have been yearning for.  The band uses keyboards and strings again, but sparingly adding just the right amount of colour and texture to the core three-piece guitar-bass-drum ensemble.<br /><br />As most listeners are aware, Clockwork Angels is the band's first full fledged concept album.  As a concept album, it succeeds on every level.  Although songs can be enjoyed individually, they work better in context of the album.  Each song adds a layer to the story, loosely based on Voltaire's Candide, of an ambitious young man set to discover and conquer the world, only to be met with resistance, disappointment, and misadventure.  The naive excitement of Caravan is augmented by the defiant and angry BU2B, wistful Halo Effect, brashness of Headlong Flight, regret and despair of BU2B2, revelation of Wish Them Well, and the characters encountered in between...until the wisdom and reconciliation of TheGarden completes the song cycle with grace and beauty.  This may not be as complete of a concept album as \\"Tommy\\" or \\"The Wall\\", but nor does it contain throwaway tracks that only serve to advance the story like \\"There's a Doctor\\", \\"Miracle Cure\\", \\"Stop!\\" or \\"Vera Lynn\\".  It is a lean 66 minute story of adventure, self-discovery, and realization.<br /><br />This album delivers as complete a listening experience as Radiohead's masterpiece, OK Computer fifteen years ago.  Rush MAY have recorded better collections of songs on Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, a Farewell to Kings, or Signals, but they have never crafted a better album package.  As for me, I just can't get enough of this album - sure, I prefer some songs to others (Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, and The Garden are CAREER highlights), but experienced in its entirety, the whole is better than the sum of the parts.
B0009MDPYW|4.0|I enjoyed Constantine quite a bit.<br />It has a good storyline as the Spear of Longinus/Destiny is a topic of considerable interest for history lovers such as myself.<br /><br />The graphics and effects were good, altho I'm not a fan of CGI FX.<br />The acting and cast are a nice touch.  I think they performed well.<br /><br />It's worth the asking price and one of those movies you might wanna watch more than once.<br /><br />I'd buy it again.<br />4*
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades of Grey is a sweet love story. I've enjoyed reading it on my kindle. I recommend it to both men and women.
034580404X|5.0|I purchased the trilogy with the mind set that I was about to read what many call female porn. To my surprise I was taken back by the characters and the story and not just the erotic sex scenes. The first 6-10 chapters were all about character introduction and giving background information which after reading the trilogy, I really appreciated.<br /><br />I felt the book reflected a real woman's emotions and thought process. The story is fictional but a lot of the interactions and emotions are very real.<br /><br />I cried, I laugh, I gasped. I am without a doubt hooked on Fifty Shades of Grey!
B00729GQ0A|2.0|I read a lot of gushing reviews for this book.  Usually I would give benefit of doubt to give it three or even four stars because of the very reasonable price; however, I wanted to give some contrast to these higher ratings, since my viewpoint disagrees.  I just could not get engaged with the characters.  There was a lot of action, with \\"vampire\\" like beings, elementals, witches, an entire new magic world view ...  But I could not find it in me to cheer for the heroine or identify with any of the characters.<br /><br />If you flag this review as unhelpful, please add specific comment on what is missing, so I can improve my reviews.  If you only want to read reviews that agree with you (your opinion is already made up) why are you bothering to read reviews?<br /><br />Why I could not get engaged (this may be spoilers):<br /><br />Sophia, the heroine wants her boyfriend to give up his immortality just so they can date. She refuses to seriously consider her other options. She could readily join him in immortality.  Or this decision can easily be postponed for a few years.  First off they are choosing to live together at this point, not make the commitment of marriage.  She strikes me as very shallow and not thinking very logically on this decision.  OK, she doesn't want to live forever, so live 50 years as a young person then have someone kill you, whatever...  To turn her back not even considering the option of joint immortality is very selfish, not giving a fair chance for her boyfriend.<br /><br />The heroine is not sympathetic and perhaps moderately stupid.  She does not figure anything out until it bonks her on the head.  OK, most people who started hearing voices would assume they were going insane.  But once she moves into the world of magic and she knows her ancestor was a witch why does not telepathy or even angels strike her as likely causes.  She still thinks she is going crazy until reassured it is only telepathy.  Also, she does not realize she needs a teaching degree to get a teaching job?<br /><br />Ivory comes across as a psycho stalker.  Is she one of the good guys or a bad person.  She just comes across as an obsessed nut case who kills people.  So they let her go when they stop her trying to murder Charles?  They show no remorse killing guards who are just doing their job; but killing a psychotic murderer doesn't even occur to them? Should there not at least be a discussion of this option?  If she removes all the memories of the person she \\"love\\" (stalks) will she just become more psychotic?<br /><br />Charles for a three hundred year old is too simple, showing no personality or knowledge.  I would expect him to dominate a twenty two year old in a relationship; possibly find her slightly immature.  In fact you could make a case for child molestation based on the age difference. How would you feel if he was a 90 year old man panting after a 22 year old virgin?  OK, so 300 years makes it right?  Lots of authors allow this type of generational romance and it's Ok, but to have the older partner be a much weaker personality seems wrong.<br /><br />The evil queen is a little power hungry but also a stereotypical evil leader.  But she seems to have no real plan aside from exerting her power.  The fire elemental seem almost too powerful.  Appears they have the power to just waltz in and destroy the council.  So where is the counterbalance?  Why isn't this conflict over as soon as it begins?<br /><br />\\"The Universe\\" is supposed to represent some form of all mighty power, able to create new beings.  But for an almighty power it sure seems to be flawed, getting it wrong over and over agaibn.  There should be some form of counterbalancing evil for this much of \\"The Universe's \\"plan to go wrong.<br /><br />The plot moves along nicely and was well thought through.  All the magic rules seem to be consistent.  Obviously there are a lot of fans who love this series and the multiple editors.  I think as a team they did a greatjob of editing , laying out the storyline, and keeping everything consistent.  But, for me the characters were neither believable nor sympathetic, making it difficult for me to get engaged in caring what happened to them.<br />Bottom line although there was a lot of action I could not find it in me to cheer when the heroine wins, or the \\"bad\\" guys lose.  Because this book is so inexpensive and so many people did enjoy it I would suggest you try it and decide for yourself.  I expect many to disagree with my opinion.

B005LZW8FO|3.0|I liked this movie. It was thought provoking, touching and actress, Brit Marling, was absolutely stunning and radiating. When I first was exposed to this movie, it was through the trailer, which was not very indicative of what the movie is actually like. It's not a science fiction film.<br /><br />The story is simple; 17 year old, aspiring M.I.T. bound college student, \\"Rhoda\\" celebrates her anticipated life trajectory but, while driving,  slams into a car killing a pregnant wife, young son and rendering the husband and father into a coma. The victim never learns about the indentity of Rhoda because she was a juvenile. Rhoda serves four years in prison and when she comes out, she is guilt-ridden and defeated. She decides to confront her surviving victim andapologize to the man but, she chickens out when she meets with him. Instead, she innocuosly enters into his life and they build a gradual relationship that blossums into romance. Since the truth in the revelation is inevitable, you can see where and how the conflict of the movie will develop.<br /><br />While this drama is onfolding, a second Earth emerges in the sky that is reachable by conventional space exploration. This \\"set up\\" is hardly scientifically possible, or even addressed, but this \\"other earth\\" is what provides this film it's emotional charge. The second earth is deemed a mirror image of this earth so, if you exists here, then you exist there. The pondered consideration is would your mirror image be the same or different? Would a bad decision here, which completely alters a life, be different there, without that bad decision? Would Rhoda be a sucessful M.I.T. student on Earth 2? Would the widower have his wife and son still alive on Earth 2?<br /><br />This movie is about second chances, what ifs, and redemption. It's about the unrealistic premise of avoiding a painful fate.<br /><br />Now, as I stated earlier, I liked this movie. It had moments of beauty, wonderful poignancy and stark drama. The two main actors were great in that they were very real, genuine and likeable. Specifically, actress Brit Marling is a captivating and she truly illuminates the screen.<br /><br />What makes the movie good also, ironically, detracts from it. This is an \\"indie\\" picture and it shows. With a shaky camera, very often too dark lighting, choppy editing, and lack of narrative,  the movie doesn't flow as well as it should. The lighting is truly bothersome but, maybe that is done purposely since the dark tints allows actress Brit Marling, with her beautiful blonde flowing hair and pretty smile, to truly light up that darkness when the camera zooms up on her.<br /><br />I would imagine that a bold movie like this, with it's subject matter and using the sci-fi angle as an allegory, could only be made through the indie channels so, I guess, it is what it is.<br /><br />This movie could touch a person, that also had a life altering incident, in a manner quite different from my own. I have been lucky to have a blessed life but a person that could empathize with the characters in this movie may view this movie in a different, very therapeuatic light and love that optimism that \\"Another Earth\\"  conveys. Hence, I could see why someone may give it stellar reviews.<br /><br />I was thinking what if this movie was re-made, but on a big budget, what it be better? I don't think so because  I feel that actress, Brit Marling, is what really established this fine, yet certainly not perfect, film.main actors were great in that they were very real, genuine and likeable.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a great game and I'm hooked. Always hard to put it down. Everybody should be playing Angry Birds in their spare time!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was so excited to read this book!! But like many of the  other readers i am very disappointed! The story is choppy and hard to follow. Many of the scenes are too breif and have to be re read to understand what just happened. its almost as if the story was printed in point form or its first draft. Very frustrating to spend that much time reading this book and then left feeling confused and let down.
0783230079|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time by chance. My television was left on for several hours while cleaning and I happened to catch it during the first 30 minutes and I was immediately spellbound. I have always adored time pieces (the 19th century, the 20's thru the 70's, etc.) and \\"Heart & Souls\\" is knee-deep in the hoopla of 50's fashion and its timely music.<br /><br />The movie stars Academy Award nominated Robert Downey, Jr. as a 30's businessman trapped with 4 ghosts who follow him, watching over him since birth. Incidentally, Thomas Reilly, Downey's character, was born the same minute in 1959 that the actual ghosts died, causing some strange reaction which blocks the ghosts' spirits not to ascend to Heaven, leaving them behind to clandestinely care for Thomas for the next 30 years.<br /><br />This film is touching, with constant slaps of comedy. The ensemble includes Kyra Sedgwick of \\"Closure\\", Elisabeth Shue, the older sister of Andrew Shue of \\"Melrose Place\\" and the very talented and underrated Alfred Woodard. With this pairing, you will be lost in the magic of this movie. It will make you believe in love again and teach you to love the ones you have......no matter their circumstances. \\"Heart & Souls\\" reminds me why I love movies. It tugs at the heart in the best way.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This series is fantastic and the online e reader version was so simple and convenient. I can't wait to start reading the next book.
B007549W62|4.0|This post- apocalyptic gem was very disturbing, but was also equally refreshing- as opposed to most of the uncreative mysteries, and formula \\" slice and dice \\"  and \\" walking dead \\" type horror movies of today. The writing was good; but the real genius was Gen's direction, and the brilliant casting.<br /><br />I had the same type of reaction with Stanley kubrick's \\" A Clockwork Orange \\" - Appalled at first by the brutality, but recognizing the truisms and parallels along with the \\" Lord Of The Flies \\" Scenario. Many people believe that they would do the \\" right thing \\" if in a similar situation, but unless you really posses a large slice of leadership qualities- ( unlike \\" Sam \\", who wimps out ) you might fall in line with the rest of the bad guys.<br /><br />As stated by the man with no name in the movie \\" High plains Drifter \\" - \\" It's what people know about themselves that really scares them \\" .<br /><br />Enjoy the movie.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|WITH THE RELEASE OF THEIR 13TH ALBUM AND THE RETURN OF DAVID ELLEFSON WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS RECORD? WELL IT IS CLASSIC MEGADETH! MABYE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS THE LAST ALBUM \\"ENDGAME\\" (WHICH IS ONE OF MEGADETH'S BEST ALBUMS AND WOULD BE HARD TO BEAT)...BUT THIS ALBUM WAS DONE VERY WELL AND ANY MEGADETH OF OLD/NEW WILL SURELY LIKE THIS ALBUM AS IT HAS A FEW SONGS THAT REALLY STAND OUT LIKE WHO'S LIFE IS IT ANYWAYS, PUBLIC ENEMY #1 AND NEW WORLD ORDER..SO IF YOUR A MEGADETH FAN GO OUT AND GET IT!

B00004YTIQ|1.0|Not that great for a inflatable pool. Loved the idea, although, it isn't working for us. It keeps the leaves out... Not the bugs. It heats up the pool water too much so when you go use the pool you have to put more water in it anyway.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun gamee easy to play and lots of challanges! also lots of different animals and charecters to get to know and lean all the things about them
B0037QM8YA|3.0|I did find this film hard to watch in places, as it is quite graphic and disturbing in parts. However as with films like these they are telling a story. Conveying a message to watchers that given certain situations awful things happen and but it's how you deal with it and try to move forward. Sadly i've read far too many reviews citing this film inspired racism or reflected negatively on black people. I don't see that, since Precious's situation and circumstances are not determined by race but by poverty and lack of education. The same issues affect all races around the world with little or no education living impoverished lives.<br /><br />Thumbs up for the director brave enough to bring it to the big screen. However being from the UK our BBC drama's and screenplays have explored these subjects which provoke just as much consternation without exploiting the black struggle message.<br /><br />It is simply a terribly sad story that was well acted, especially by the mother.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Too bad the Joker won't be back. Rest in peace Broke Back Mountain dude!
B001MIV0J4|3.0|Was not expecting the movie to be this way. Since I bought this movie I have only seen it twice and was still unsure on the way it was gonna be. I need to see more times and hope it will change my mind. Great condition and fast service.
1476712042|5.0|Review 6 ******<br /><br />I borrowed this book from a friend to read, and I enjoyed it so much, I just had to write a review!<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is a fantastic character. She is an eighteen year old college student, but she has a secret past. When she meets Travis Maddox, the sparks fly as she resists his advances.<br /><br />Travis is a great guy, but he's VERY popular with the ladies! (nudge, nudge, wink, wink!). He's charming and suave, but he can be extremely deadly with his fists. He fights to win college money. He is intrigued by Abby's resistance to his charm, and makes a bet that will alter both their lives.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic YA romance that had me smiling a lot, but it also had me shed a few tears. I fell in love with all the characters, but I liked America (Mere), Abby's friend and confidant. She is quite spunky and has a quick wit. Parker made a nice foil for a love triangle, but I think that his character was a bit weak. He could have had a bit more depth to him. However, having said that, Abby and Travis are like WOW together!<br /><br />There is a lot of teen angst and drinking going on, as well as the mention of sex and sexual acts, but they are not overtly erotic and don't go into great detail. All in all, this is one book that I found to be an extremely engaging read that had me glued to the pages! I highly recommend this book, but to those over the age of 16 only. Now I have read this book, I'm considering getting this authors next book for myself!
B003V3FVKC|5.0|This is the best film I ever seen in a long time about the way life could be for any young person trying to fit in this world. Sandra Bullock play a wonderful part and the young boy who plays the football player is great. It made me think what if...so I hope no out there as a student does not have to face things like this. Great film and must see you will love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is great fun testing your spatial. skills. I like how you can start over and reverse a move. I hope I never finish them all.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Wow great film and I liked how they all tie up together. You would never guess that this film has a connection at the end but if you watch it and really pay attention to it then you can figure how it all works together. Whoever came up with this idea was great. Some parts maybe boring but they are not. This is an excellent movie.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book although I found the sex scenes a bit much and had to skip over them at times. Does anyone have that much sex anyway
B002ZG980U|5.0|This film is a mind blowing movie and makes you think on how we see the world. I enjoyed this movie to the end. I need to order another one due to theft. Helen Page is a great actor as well as Leonardo DiCapro. The places that they go and see is neat. Excellent movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a great application. I use it many times during the day and it very convenient to have available when you need a calculator quickly. I love it.
B002VKE17U|4.0|Was a great suspense movie and I really enjoyed watching it. Again I saw it on a preview and was curious on how the movie would be.  The actors are good and the plot is good. Edge of your seat again kinda movie and keep you wondering what it will be like at the end.  Excellent condition and fast service.
0307949486|5.0|Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy begins with this thrilling novel about Mikael Blomkvist, a political magazine publisher and how he's being convicted in a case against a man named Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. Agreeing that he's innocent and having the evidence to back it up, Henrik Vanger promises to provide Blomkvist with such evidence. However, he has to follow a condition. This condition is that Blomkvist helps him solve a mystery that's been going along through his family. This mystery is the disappearance of Vanger's great-niece, Harriet. This is the meat of the novel.<br /><br />The person helping him investigate is a brilliant researcher by the name of Lisbeth Salander. She IS the girl with the dragon tattoo. Salander is covered in tattoos, piercings, is rebellious, and is a social misfit. Even Blomkvist made a guess as to her having Asperger's Syndrome. Teaming up with Blomkvist, the two make an incredible team that provides a novel that's proves to be an adventure.<br /><br />When published in Sweden, the original title to this novel was \\"Man som hatar kvinnor,\\" which translates to \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" from Swedish to English. Men engaging to cruel acts toward women proves to be a key theme in this novel. One prime example is that of Salander's new guardian, Nils Bjurman, who replaces her older one after sickness. He gives her money, but requires sexual acts in exchange. Don't worry, she has her way with him, but I won't provide details in order to build excitement.<br /><br />Another helpful diagram is that of the Vanger family tree. I saw myself referring to the family tree time and time again in order to make the family connections as the novel progressed. It's featured toward the beginning of the novel, so it introduces the tree and allows it to remain a part of the novel.<br /><br />This novel was an extraordinary thrill ride that contributes to an excellent series. This may also be part of the reason that Swedish literature is becoming bigger in America, with names like the late Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell (author of the Wallander series), and John Ajvide Lindqvist (author of \\"Let The Right One In), Swedish fiction is really making its way into America. The Millennium Trilogy is surely a strong contributor and the death of Larsson really is a tragedy for the world of fiction.with names like the late Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell (author of the Wallander series), and John Ajvide Lindqvist (author of \\"Let The Right One In), Swedish fiction is really making its way into America.
