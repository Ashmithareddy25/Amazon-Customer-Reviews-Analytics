B001DTPZNY|1.0|Why George, why did you have to ruin one of the most magnificent trilogies in the movie history? After \\"The Lost Ark\\", \\"The Temple of the Doom\\" was a bit of a let-down, but it still was, and is, a fine movie well worth your time. With \\"The Last Crusade\\" in the late 1980s the series came to a perfect conclusion. And now that! Well, for me Indiana Jones remains a perennial favourite, one of these movies I can re-watch any time with a lot of pleasure - but it remains a trilogy.    Everything in the \\"Crystal Skull\\" is plain wrong or dead dull - or both. To begin with, the plot is ridiculous: aliens in the jungle, indeed! Compared to the sweeping stories of the Ark and the Holy Grail, this stuff looks as hackneyed and trite as flying saucers myths. Second, the Russians make nowhere near as fine villains as the Nazis do, despite Cate Blanchett's irresistible accent. Third, action and special effects have always been one of the hallmarks of these movies, but not in such amount and not in so preposterous a fashion. Fourth, the trademark humour is more or less completely missing, being replaced by vapid and contrived jokes. The appallingly artificial Shia LaBeouf and the nostalgic presence of Karen Allen don't help the stupid and overblown screenplay, either. The few moments deliberately introduced to remind us of the earlier movies (e.g. Indi in Princeton) only make this crap more painful to watch - if that's possible.    If there ever is such a peak of deliberate perversity as fifth Indiana Jones movie, I know I will not see it. For I am perfectly sure that it will be the same utter disappointment and complete waste of time as \\"The Crystal Skull\\". If anything, this movie only proves the old maxim that it's never too late to make yourself ridiculous. George, Steven and co. certainly have.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this version of Persuasion.  The actors/actresses look exactly as I pictured them.  The main characters are not young in the book, they are almost 30 and late 30s.  I think that's why I love this book more than some others by Austen.  And for once the roles are reversed, it's the woman who was wealthy and had to reject a poor suitor.  So now she is forced to realize what she gave up.  I never go into plot details in a review, but this one follows the book fairly faithfully.  As for chemistry between the main characters...it's portrayed as just beneath the surface, as so much of Austen is.  If you like the book, try this version.

Having just seen him live and never wanting that night to end, at least this fantastic set lets me relive that wonderful night over and over again.

My only complaint would be that some of the songs are cut short, and it kinda stinks to not be able to hear all the the lyrics.    Great for the price though! and the pictures that come with the album are epic.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is one of my favorite games - beautiful graphics and music, relaxing yet challenging. Unlike most games which are timed or keep you stuck on one level if you can't solve it, Quell gives solutions (through in-game hints as well as online videos). While I do prefer to solve the games on my own, it's nice to have other options. No angry birds or loud noises, just a beautiful classical soundtrack! Can't wait for Quell Reflect to be available for Android!
0767817486|5.0|Even though this movie is some years ago I still find it relevent today. I was of age to see this movie when it was first made but honestly don't remember it. I was watching TV late one night and my friend brought it up in conversation and within minutes this movie actually came on cable. After seeing it I just had to purchase it and very glad to have it in my selection of great movies.

0545123275|4.0|A great teenage love story between a girl attacked by werewolves and the boy who saved her. Sam, a werewolf himself, as only a little time left before he changes into a wolf for the final time, unable to ever change back to a human. Even though their relationship is played out against the backdrop of a ticking clock, it never feels rushed or overly desperate. The gradual leading up to declarations of love and moments of increasing intimacy seem natural.    I read this one in one sitting. It was well paced so that I wanted to keep reading to see how each situation was resolved. The characters seemed very believable and the author's take on wolves was nicely done. Most of the dialogue was realistic and had more than its share of laugh out loud moments.     The narration switches back and forth between Sam and Grace pretty seamlessly. Only a few times did I have to switch back to the chapter heading to remind myself who was speaking. Making their voices a little more distinct would have made this device really work, I think. Twilight (the comparisons are inevitable) suffers from only being told from Bella's POV, which doesn't allow the reader to fully understand how Bella and Edward fell in love.     Both Sam and Grace are strong and smart characters. Grace seems to be portrayed slightly better than Sam. It's probably hard for a middle aged woman to write convincingly as a teenage boy, so I give her a small pass for that.     Grace's nearly non-existent parents, however, seem more like a plot device designed to make sure that Sam and Grace get to spend the maximum amount of time together when she's not at school. Since Sam can't really go outside (cold weather being the trigger for turning into a wolf), most of their interactions take place indoors, in Grace's home, while her parents are ALWAYS gone. It seemed a little too easy for me but given the constraints of not being able to go outside and the limited time Sam and Grace have together before he changes into a wolfforever, I don't see any other way for their relationship to get off the ground.    (SPOILER-ALERT) I'm glad this is a series, though, and I'll definitely continue reading it. As far as the intimacy scenes go, they are very nicely done considering this is a YA novel. The scenes were realistic but not graphic. The only false note was the throwaway line the morning after when Grace reminds Sam that they \\"used protection\\". I don't see how. There's never a scene where either Sam or Grace buy condoms. Grace's inner monologue is a pretty clear indication she was a virgin and Sam definitely was, so the condoms weren't just stashed in a drawer in her bedroom. It feels like the editor only allowed the author to add the scene under the condition that they remind young readers to be safe. The way the sex scene was written and its timing made perfect sense. The use of condoms did not.

B005COO1X6|3.0|The creepy factor is still there with the best short story writer of all time, but the ending left me wanting a little more closure. The language was pretty strong and pretty often, something that made me a little uncomfortable. I liked the characters and loved the car, but the abrupt ending leaves you scratching your head saying \\"What the .....?\\"<br /><br />I'm still trying to decide if I really liked the book or not. I'll give it a few months and re-read it and decide then.<br /><br />Stephen King still makes you squirm with the way he writes. That much has not changed.<br />All I can say is \\"Give it a try\\".
1594202842|3.0|I picked up the book based on what I read on the Wall Street Journal article.    This book was thought provoking in the extremes a parent would go through for their children to be successful. Yes, Ms. Chua produced highly educated and talented children, but look at the sacrifice her children had to endure.    Asian adults, or Americans of Asian descent, who were raised using Amy Chua's tactics will tell you the void they have in their lives mentally because of having to go through that type of rearing.     The book will give you the impression that this is representative of all Chinese parents, in particular mothers. I will be the first to tell you, this is NOT the case. Why? Because I know Chinese parents, and they do NOT treat their children like this.    The book will lend itself to you wanting to hate Ms. Amy Chua because of the way she does things. Let there be no mistake, she produced, so far, two smart children. It also lends to you ask, what role did the husband/father play in the book. The book does not delve much into what role he plays, although she does go on the mention him in several instances. It is obvious, that the book begs the question, \\"who really wore the pants in that family.\\" Obviously, it wasn't daddy!    Amy Chua's eldest daughter is able to adjust and play well with Amy Chua's methods. The problem comes with the younger daughter, Lulu, where she does not adjust well to Amy Chua's methods, and slowly it gets to a boiling point of where both mother and youngest daughter at almost each other's throats.    The climax of the book is the trip to Moscow where the younger daughter, Lulu, are at restaurant, and there is a disagreement over, get this, food! That's right, mommy dearest argues with her youngest over food and they have their shouting match to which . It is than that Ms. Amy Chua relents and gives in to Lulu's demand to stop being over bearing an a \\"tiger\\" mother.    It is a interesting book to read, because you get to see an extreme form of parenting and the results it yields. Keep in mind this IS NOT representative of all Asian mothers or Chinese mothers. This is very important to understand.    Lastly, I can tell you this, my mother was laid back, but my father was very strict with my eldest brothers and sister, and even he knew when to draw the line.
B001O37WTY|5.0|The Movie Being John Malkovich was fantastic. John Malkovich and the cast are so good. It was really a super film.
0596805527|5.0|I definitely recommend this book, hands down. I've had the privilege of having this book since the first edition, and let me tell you, it is worth every penny!    The book starts off by giving you a basic run down on the scripting language and than into the semantics of the language. Please bear in mind, this book than goes into integrating JavaScript and scripting CSS, to jQuery to AJAX calls. If you don't have a background in JavaScript and how it interacts with the web browser, this book may be a tough sell to you. But if you are versed in how the web browser interacts with JavaScript, than this book is a must have!    A good selling point about this book is that it has an in-depth reference. I can not stress how this book pulled me out of a jam because I couldn't remember function/method calls.    My suggestion if you do not have the fundamentals of browser scripting:    Understand how JavaScript and web browser interact  Learn how JavaScript treats object simulation and web browser objects  Learn how JavaScript and CSS interact
0385736002|3.0|This book begins well enough, and the writing flows at an OK pace - I agree that there is some OVER mentioning of things through out the story, but I guess i started to tune out certain parts of the story to go along with the major part of the tale - I enjoy the amalgamation of Myth and History in a modern day - I enjoyed the read but I did not LOVE it - I may continue to read this series at a later date, but only if I can find the next few books cheap and used - this is not worth the newsstand price in full - however, it was entertaining enough to finish, I just do not feel like there was anything new offered - just a story with others myths thrown in with a new twist, in that they are \\"real\\" and what-not - over-all, I give it a three out of five due to being different, just not \\"unique\\".

B001MWBK4U|2.0|2 1/2 hours of instruction (with illustrations) in how badly behaved adult males can be when unchaperoned was way more than I signed up for.    Problems with the film:    1. Way too long.    2. The unattractive Romanian locales bear no resemblance to the Smokies. I had to suspend my disbelief, as it were, for the obvious disconnect. I'm guessing, based on the somewhat acerbic commentary at the beginning of the movie, by the late Anthony Minghella, that the Romanian venue choice was due to budget considerations. (It also provided grist for the London tabloids' later reporting of the Jude Law/Nicole Kidman brouhaha.)    3. Given the low moral estate of many of the male characters, it beggars belief that the evil \\"Teague\\" would have limited his interest in Kidman to mere ogling. Serial rape would have been Kidman's fate in reality, no matter what the late Mr. Minghella might have imagined.    4. The upcountry North Carolinians were not rabid supporters of the Confederacy as they were portrayed in the movie. Many, in fact, wanted to have nothing to do with the war. They were, and still are, an independent lot. What else would you expect from Scotch-Irish?     5. The final shootout was disappointing. We waited 2 1/2 hours, and we got--a dead Jude Law and a pregnant Kidman? In the infamous words of Serena Williams (Forest Hills, 9/11/11): Come on!
B001TOD92C|5.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that is so well crafted that it is almost perfect. \\"The Wrestler\\" is one of these rarities. I saw it when it first came out and, years later, wondered if it is as good as I remembered it to be. It is.

B0050PYNN0|2.0|This movie tries soo hard to be funny but it cannot provide more then few rare smiles. It had the potential, meaning being funny without making fun of an actual movie, a spoof. How can you make the movie funny with a single idea? A lazy, unatractive guy, always envies his almost gay brother because of his success in life. One joke....where is the rest? make it a physical comedy, I will follow and agree. but this movie was not. Unrated version had few female flesh flashed to you and very, very vulgar language, there you have unrated movie. Do not waste your movie to buy it. Use some of those vending machines to get a $1 movie or use Amazon.com instant video Honestly, you will waste your 17 dollars with this movie.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I enjoyed the first three books of the series, but the last two left me feeling cheated and sorry that I had ever started reading A Song of Ice and Fire.  I feel like Martin could have cut out a lot of pointless material and given us a satisfying trilogy with a real ending. Instead I wasted a lot of time and money as I slogged to the end hoping for resolution.  I have told my husband who has watched the TV series not to bother reading it.    The best thing I can say about the series as a whole is that the books had really good titles.    A Dance with Dragons was the worst of the series.  It goes round and round like water down a toilet bowl.  I kept thinking at least one story line would reach a satisfying conclusion, but, alas, it appears Mr. Martin just gave up.    Normally, when I read a series that I enjoy, I seek out everything else that author has written.  Even though I have heard good things about Martin's earlier work, this series has left me with no desire to investigate.

B0018RWD1S|5.0|Three years before BACK TO BLACK Amy Winehouse had her debut cd FRANK.  This album is even more traditional jazz/pop than the later release but the two combined are a major showcase of how truly gifted Amy Winehouse was.  She indeed left a musical legacy.  With BACK TO BLACK she truly personified her individual identity.  With FRANK she mixed the sounds of traditional jazz with soul and pop to even techno with magnificent results.  The second disc here is bonus material with the first being the actual cd.  And believe me it in no way plays like a debut cd.  Amy has been compared to the likes of Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday and we see why here.  Her interpretations of the classics MOODY'S MOOD FOR LOVE and THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE are truly superb.  And her self penned YOU SENT ME FLYING and I HEARD LOVE IS BLIND equal these classics in song and performance.  She wrote most of the music here.  STRONGER THAN ME, TAKE THE BOX, AMY AMY AMY and WHAT IS IT ABOUT MEN show multi-faceted sides of Amy.  All are excellent.  And then there is the witty FU** ME PUMPS which is in the vein of the BACK TO BLACK tracks.  This entire cd is a true showcase of a musically gifted vocalist, songwriter and song interpreter.  Her voice soars with full emotion and a unique combination of power and sublety to make musical magic.<br /><br />This set with the bonus disc is a must.  Many of the songs on disc 2 are the same songs from the first disc done in different styles or mixes and they are standouts.  There are also some live performances here.  The true standout of course is her amazing interpretation of SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME.  It is breathtaking.  One listen and the unique talents of this woman are evident.  It is very sad that the untimely death of Amy Winehouse is what it took many to be introduced to this album but owning it is a must.  It is a true classic and highly recommended to Amy Winehouse fans and also true jazz and soul purists.

030726999X|5.0|A satisfying completion to the Millenium Trilogy. The continuing story didn't spare details about a pleathora of more characters, places, and events; however as you approach the last 100-or-so pages you will understand how it's just part of the ingredients to make for a sturdy and credible finale. I regret, in one sense, that I've not got other areas of life to explore with my \\"friends\\", Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist; since there will be no further stories from Mr. Larsson. I do look forward once again, in the near future, to begin the trilogy again. The characters and their perspectives have an amazing staying power with me; not just from the stories in the three books I've read, but I can \\"hear\\" what I feel their perspectives would be on everyday things that I see and feel. Obviously, Mr. Larsson carefully placed his heart and soul into their development.

Hedlund steals the film though.  He is amazing.  i like him in everything he does and can't wait to see what he does next.  this guy is the next big thing.  when he is on stage peforming in this film, you are sucked in and want more.  you don't want the music to stop.      the one really cheesy part is when Paltrow is on stage and they keep flashing back to McGraw's face.   not necessary and distracting.    my daughters made me watch this movie (as they did Zombieland) and i was  pleasantly surprised by both; loved them both!

B001HN6922|3.0|The 4-star rating above composes 3 stars for the story and 5 for the animation - I err on the side of generosity as, of course, Cars 2 is not as bad as the critics said. They didn't particularly like the original Cars, so they were unlikely to welcome a sequel with open arms, especially one with Mater as the main character! But this isn't a straightforward sequel that leaves the spirit of the original intact. I found it surprisingly violent. Other reviewers commented on the torture scene - and that's not the only nasty moment. It definitely should have got the PG rating mysteriously allocated to its predecessor in the UK which was really a U (G). The set pieces are spectacular, but as this film sets off doggedly down the action movie route there is little counterbalancing character development or emotional buy-in that distinguish Pixar at its best. Given that the original file has cult status among under-10 boys, I felt that the plot is quite complex for younger children to grasp, even if they're not bothered by the violence. At least this will make it watchable for a repeat viewing.   Following the success of the \\"Mater's Tall Tales\\" short films, Mater has obviously emerged as the most popular (or marketable, or John Lasseter's favourite) Cars character, so Pixar decided to make him the central character in Cars 2. Having closed the loop on Radiator Springs in the original film they needed a McGuffin to make \\"Mater's Tall Tales the Movie\\" work. Unfortunately the vehicle (no pun) chosen is a spy film, a rather dated genre which sends the film off down the violent action path with very limited opportunity for character development (think: when did you last really care about anyone in a James Bond film, even the hero?) It also sidelines the racing theme - surely the unique selling point of a film about anthropomorphic cars - along with most of the strong characters from the first film. Even Lightning McQueen plays second fiddle to Mater in Cars 2.   The original Carswas criticised, unfairly, for its long slow middle section. But, this did give time for character development so sorely lacking here. Cars 2 over compensates by accelerating into rocket speed in the middle after a fast start and not slowing up until the end.   On the positive side the animation is truly amazing (and will be equally amazing in 2D). If only it had a better story to tell! As a digitially animated London whisked past at rocket speed towards the end I felt that a lot of talent - and money (it cost $200 million to make!) had been splurged in making a film that's not the sum of what went into it. I left the cinema dazzled, slightly disappointed but hoping that there will be a successor. Like Shrek the Third, Cars 2 really isn't a bad film, but it has let down its predecessor and needs a final chapter to redeem the franchise. But please, Pixar, don't make Mater's Tall Tales 2!   ** Update after rewatching on DVD - In my heart of hearts I can't justify this film being any higher than 3 stars so have downgraded my review rating. There are many fine vignettes and details in this film especially in the Paris sequence (yes, that is Gusteau's Restaurant from Ratatouille renamed as Gastow's) and the plot is much more understandable second time. But the film is misjudged and lacks the warmth of the original Cars: which was a definite 5-star film. The paucity of bonuses on the DVD tells its own story: \\"Air Mater\\" (a new Mater's Tall Tales - advertising the forthcoming \\"Planes\\") and the Toy Story toon which accompanied the cinema release. No making-of documentary, studio stories or director's commentary. Plus the biggest give way of the lot: the word \\"Classic\\" on back of the DVD box. Last time I saw this was on Chicken Little - enough said! Even the technical expertise of the animation screams vanity project. I think Pixar realise that they've produced a 24-carat misfire and this film will sink faster than Finn McMissile when he abandons the oil rig in the opening sequence.
1580084621|5.0|Got this book out of the library during a bout of fascination with Thai cuisine(It's always been my favorite but decided to try making it!) and this is definitely going to be going onto my bookshelf on Christmas. The beginning of the book where the history of Thailand and cultural nuances are explained is fascinating and arguably my favorite part of the book, the description of the ingredients is detailed enough that you won't ever really feel the need to search the internet to find out what something is(though you may, as I did, need to look up alternatives that he does not mention or says you should never use such as ginger for galangal) and the recipes look scrumptious.     I live in one of the outer boroughs of New York City(Flushing, Queens) which is known for it's Asian community(Korean, Chinese and Indian) but I've yet to find some of the ingredients that are needed(specifically for the beef panaeng). I asked clerks at two H-Marts(one that's very \\"asian\\" and one that's rather american), which is an asian grocer, if they had galangal and kaffir and both times I was met with flat stares. I checked the produce(for both), canned/dried(galangal), freezer(kaffir) and the spice sections as I had read online that it's sometimes sold as a dried spice or frozen but no dice. Then went to a place called LL Mart which caters to a far more asian clientele than the H Marts but this time when I asked for galangal they brought me to a \\"Galangal Ginger Pepper\\" labeled bottle which, when reading the ingredients, turned out to be grated ginger. Due to these issues, I've yet to try any of the recipes but I will be heading into Jackson Heights and Manhattan to try and find a real Thai/South East Asian grocer this week and will hopefully find both. Another thing that's been difficult to find are DRIED long red chilis(fresh was easy, all 3 shops had them). I found alternatives online for both(lime zest and a bit of juice for kaffir and ginger for galangal) but I hope to stick to therecipes as they were meant to be made, the Thai way.     Generally, I'd not tell you about my search for ingredients but I thought it worth the time this review because that is how much David Thompson made me fall in love with Thai cooking in his writing. I've used alternatives, even those not suggested by the author, a hundred times in the past and I'm sure I will in the future but after reading this book, I'm more than happy to go searching for obscure ingredients for a couple of hours.

B005BW0TO4|2.0|Maybe I was wrong about 3DD.  Their first album rocked, quite a bit, and I have mostly disappointed with every album since.  Sure there are some up tempo songs here and there, but do we really need every other song on an album to be a slow slow ballad.  Don't get me wrong, some will love this album, it's just not rock, more like soft pop.  I think Bon Jovi rocks more now than 3DD does and probably Dick Bennett too.  To me 3DD went the way of Dep Leppard and departed from rock songs to sappy ballads alienating the fans who used to enjoy their music.  Just because you score huge success with a ballad doesn't mean that is all you should write.  Disappointed and probably the last album of 3DD I will buy.  If they pieced together good songs since their debut, you might be able to make one solid album out of the rest.  Maybe I was wrong thinking they were a rock band to begin with, and \\"A Better Life\\" was not who they really were.

Instead of just writing  a good story, he tries to be crafty and creative in his twists and turns from location to location.  It is plain tiresome.  This book is gone for good and I could care less.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset works wonderfully. I have had no problems with the construction. My signal is never interrupted even though my receiver is located right next to my wireless router. Definitely happy with the purchase. Haven't had the opportunity to use the additional buttons, but I really don't need them. Love that the controls for volume can be easily adjusted fom the headset and the fold away mic is awesome because it practically disappears when it's in the up position. I get about 25 feet of range from the receiver which is a plus.

0143039830|2.0|I did not get this book - it was perhaps meant to be some kind of philosophical exercise exploring the way meaning is created by turning the relationship of the author and the novel on its head, making the reader question the idea of fiction and the story form.     It also attempted to explore the idea of identity and some other existential hogwash. There's probably some sense of the book writing the author (rather than the other way round), with some self-conscious cross-referencing of characters between the three stories and the appearance of Auster himself as a character for an added touch of novelty.     There was also a film noir quality to the setting where a detective is tasked to search out a missing person and the hunter becomes the hunted in the process, with the detective losing his sense of self and purpose and questioning his own existence, but I got lost in the cleverness of the stories and it became virtually unreadable. But I plodded on because this is Auster and I enjoyed his 'Oracle Night', 'The Brooklyn Follies', and the superb 'Man in the Dark'.
1439170916|5.0|As a physicist and an engineering professional, I was hooked by the book from the first moment of reading the book to the last word. I have read very broadly across many serious subjects over the years including philosophies. The Emperor of All Maladies inspired me far more than any other books had.    Previously, I was content with the concept that cancer (mutation of gene) is a necessary evil which, at the same time, enables a specie to adopt new challenges from the environment. I also accept the concept that death dignifies life. After I lost my beloved sister to stomach cancer 3 years ago, I had a decision not to be treated by chemotherapy if I would be diagnosed to a late-stage cancer.    The book completely changed my perspective. Fighting against cancer is no longer a fight for my own life. Everybody will die. I would rather die as a hero for saving my country or my family. But, if I have to die of cancer, I will fight for advancing the cancer research for the mankind with my dying body, just like numerous many who had died as fighters.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well I had pre-orederd this...until I heard about there being even more changes.<br /><br />These are no longer the movies I loved as a kid. They are new, different, much crappier movies.<br /><br />I still have my original copies of the original versions on VHS. The picture quality isn't good. But at least it's a great movie and not this redesigned BS.<br /><br />At this point Lucas may as well make Alderaan shoot first at the Death Star.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Since writing this, the whole deal with Disney buying the rights to Star Wars happened. Thankfully they wrestled the rights to Star Wars away from Lucas before he put Hayden Christensen into an old man mask and redid the scene at the end of Jedi where Anikan Skywalker takes his helmet off and sees Luke with his own eyes. That would have completed Lucas' vision to erase Sebastian Shaw from history.<br /><br />Now that Disney owns the right, lets hope they do the right thing! Put the original theatrical releases on Blu Ray! I'm absolutely certain that would help in recouping that $4 billion investment cost paid for the Star Wars franchise. I have money. I want to give it to you for this. Help me Disney. You're my only hope!<br /><br />Also one small note to J.J. Abrams as he creates episodes 7, 8, and 9...DO NOT SCREW THIS UP!!!!!
B004EPZ09S|3.0|You have to give credit to the producers, director and writers of 'Contagion'; throw into a film a rapidly spreading virus, a race against time, scads of dying people and more getting sick every day, and they managed to make a film that was, well, in a word...boring.<br /><br />The film has a great look, the acting is pretty good, the cast excellent, but there is little (and I mean little) suspense, few surprises, little tension.  Tepid is the word I'm looking for here, and that's not good when you're talking about a potentially stunning and exciting film.  To be honest, the film looks as though it was made by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) A/V department as a training film for new staff.  Maybe you'd bring it in to a Senate budget subcommittee hearing pleading for a larger budget.<br /><br />What went wrong with 'Contagion'?  Well, to begin with, the script has no zing, no pizzazz, no life.  To employ a bad pun, the movie flatlines quite early.<br /><br />And the ending?  Even more B-O-R-I-N-G! than the rest of the film.  Yeah, it answers a question I was sort of interested in.  Not that much, to be honest.  To say it was anti-climatic is to say that a film of someone sleeping is anti-climatic.  Actually, a guy sleeping would have more life than the ending to this film.<br /><br />Remember 'Outbreak' with Dustin Hoffman?  That was a film about a similar subject, and it was immeasurably better than this film.  Heck, even the decades-old 'The Andromeda Strain' was a better film about an infection, and that disease only killed a few folks.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't let the great trailer and manufactured hype about the film get you to park your rear end in front of this film.  Skip it, and watch 'Outbreak' or 'The Andromeda Strain'.  Or watch a superior SF film like 'Contact' or 'Gattaca'.  Jude Law was in both this film and that the latter.  Damn, he was good in Gattaca.<br /><br />Want to learn about how the CDC and the World Health Organization would confront a pandemic?  Like sitting through a lecture series on the subject?  Then this film is OK.  If you want unbearable tension, compelling characters, and twists and turns leading to a wholly unexpected ending?  Then this film, ain't that film.<br /><br />Too bad.  I had high hopes for this one.  A wasted opportunity.  Who greenlighted this???<br /><br />Update:  I was kind of right about this being a CDC training film.  The producers worked 'very closely' with the CDC in making this film, which accounts for much of the tameness.<br /><br />This disease spreads rapidly throughout the world, killing many.  This would change everything.  But, about all you'll get when you watch this film is an epidemic of yawns.  It just didn't involve me.  It's important to identify with characters in order to care about what happens to them.  That didn't happen for me.  Sorry.cture series on the subject?  Then this film is OK.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|If you like any special features at all do not buy this version.   They are doing the same thing as Avatar.   This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features.  Not so much as a trailer.   They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd.  ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time.    Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned.  And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a \\"movie only\\" release.
B004K00NMG|4.0|I just got this Blu ray of this movie today at Walmart much cheaper then what Amazon has it for. But the movie I have seen a lot on tv. This is not a Disney movie it was made by 20th Century Fox The blu ray has way more bonus features then all the previously released dvds. The picture is great if you have a blu ray get this movie. Also included is the direct to video release called Bartok The Maginficent also in HD. Also the Aaliyah music video for her version of Journey to the Past but not included is the video to At The Begining

B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is great for adults and for children.  My grandchildren and I watch this movie together, but I watch it alone also.  It's great!
B004WCTLNY|4.0|This film is unusual in that it successfully combines genres that don't often work together - sci-fi and love story, with action thrown in to boot. Because of the great chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, it is the love story that works the best. Damon is perfect as a charismatic New York politician, and Blunt is even better as a soulful, quirky, up-and-coming dancer. Casting her against Damon, rather than going with a more traditional 'leading lady'/love interest was one of the best decisions of the film.<br /><br />The movie is based on a story by Phillip Dick (which I have not read), in which Damon's and Blunt's characters meet by chance, and are instantly drawn to each other, but have no way to meet again. Strange men-in-black types (with hats) seem to be following Damon, and we soon discover are bent on keeping Damon and Blunt from ever finding each other. It doesn't work, they do meet, and everything goes awry from there. The movie explores themes of free will vs. fate, and I would say also different notions of religious faith and the idea of a guiding force (i.e. 'the chairman' in this film.)<br /><br />I was intrigued the entire time, and the only reason I can't give it 5 vs. 4 stars is that I felt the 'adjustment bureau' portrayals (the men-in-black-with-hats) were a bit cheesy. At times they were comical (especially John Slattery's portryal) and I think perhaps the film should have just gone with that comedic aspect and let this be a little more of a dark comedy. But the others played their parts straight, and so the tone was a bit off. And I felt Harry, the primary 'agent' assigned to Damon's character, never got developed enough to be the centerpiece of the movie in the way the plot set him up to be.<br /><br />So there was a bit of confusion on tone, and the underdevelopment of that one character. Otherwise, this was a great - and unusual - film, with fine performances by Damon and Blunt.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|So you star wars fans who have been around since day one are getting angered by the directors desision to make changes to his very own creation. Maybe he is not making these changes for you, maybe he is making them to please his very own imagination or feelings of the story he made and a universe he created, He can do what he darn well pleases to do with his story, because after all its his creation he can mold and reshape it as he wants. So stop waisting your time and just dust off the old laser disc star wars release for your classic viewing pleasure.

It works every bit of the body EVERYTHING and I love it. especially because its only 20 minutes and I'll be able to do this before going to work. Try this video. Dont buy expensive gym memberships and/or equipment. This is it!

This is the ultimate cocktail table book except it will never just stay on the table.  People devour the contents.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|This album is so good that it makes me want to ask my plumber for financial advice (see Laurie's liner notes)! Like a lot of American kids who came of age in the '60's, my first exposure to the blues was through white English bands like the Animals, Manfred Mann, the Yardbirds, the original Fleetwood Mac, and the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton--and those are still great blues albums, all these years later. So the fact that Laurie happens to be a white Englishman is hardly a problem--any more than BB King's killer version of Willie Nelson's country classic \\"Nightlife\\" is a problem in the reverse direction. This album reminds me a little of \\"Jazz\\", Ry Cooder's brilliant homage to early jazz, and I hope there will be many more to come. Maybe the next one could include Red \\"House\\" or the \\"House\\" of the Rising Sun...

B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's that easy to recommend this set. My original \\"review\\" is below. Well, like most of the \\"reviews\\" on here it wasn't actually a review, it was a criticism of decisions made by these films' creator and a wholly-unfair rating based on prejudices, but I threw in my two cents and affected this INCREDIBLE set's rating just as they did.<br /><br />All controversy aside, this is the best addition to my BD collection since I started collecting 19 months ago (maybe the Alien Anthology beats it). The movies themselves look BRILLIANT (aside from some issues that pop up here and there, but we're not necessarily looking for \\"reference\\" quality we're looking for EXTREME WATCHABILITY), the sound is absolutely FANTASTIC and there are more special features than I can go through in a month. Well, it'd take a lot less time were I not living in a world of such HORRIBLE distractions, such as a JOB and a WIFE (and football!!) but everything I've seen so far makes me happy. It's probably due to the fact that my home theater set up is the best I've been able to experience since I saw these movies in the theaters, a lot better than I used to watch the DVDs on, but with a decent-sized HDTV and even a passable 5.1 surround system you'll know firsthand how great this COMPLETE SAGA is. It demolishes the visual and audio quality of the DVD set in every imaginable way, and is most definitely well worth the upgrade if you love these films as much as I do, or just love films in general.<br /><br />I'm just so happy I want as many people as possible to watch these so we can talk about em! There's a lot of changes, a LOT less so than those made for the special editions in '97 and the original DVD release in 2004, but they're all in a package that's so much more fantastically put together I don't look forward to ever having to give up this set.<br /><br />Star Wars is such an integral part of our popular culture, and it will certainly outlive naysayers and bandwagoning Lucas negativists. We can be as particular as we like, but when that supplants the sheer joy and innocence of experiencing fun movies like these, hasn't the point been lost?<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />[[[[[I cannot believe Milos Forman would release his Best Picture Oscar Winning Classic AMADEUS on blu ray and NOT INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE?!!!

I have been reading through just about every review and almost to a tee it's SHAME on you George and baloney like that. Shame on YOU, so-called Star Wars purist, for thinking anyone really cares about your opinion on a super-famous creative filmmaker's intentions. I find it at turns hilarious and pathetic that you spend your time publicly (and anonymously) lambasting someone who is so far removed from you. \\"Giving us the finger\\"? You give yourself the finger when you think the way you feel about these things are legitimate. Intentionally screwing us? If that were the case then wouldn't we just be getting a LITERALLY repackaged product from DVD? After all, once people have this in their homes there won't be anything they can do about it, right? How about the dvd version on a blu ray disc? That'll really annoy the fanbase. And just about all of us won't care anyway and just lap it up in heaping portions because it's Star Wars and we consume any and all things Star Wars, right? I mean, why should they bother to adapt films to a newer, higher quality home video format? SHAME on you Ridley Scott for bringing Alien to blu ray. Ghastly!<br /><br />I truly hate how you anonymous vocal group feels its become your mission to prevent anyone from just enjoying the Star Wars movies as we all have for years.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I love Stephen King. I've been reading his books since I was 12 or 13, and he's the writer I judge all other writers by. Anyone who knows me knows how it pains me to give something he wrote two stars. The sad fact is, I'm pretty sure if anyone else had written this I'd only give it one star. I can't seem to bring myself to take off the 2nd star though the book doesn't really deserve it.<br /><br />I bought this book for my Kindle, happy to give my old friend SK my $2.99. I was surprised when the book ended abruptly at 80%, and the other 20% was a preview of his new novel coming out in November. A cheap ploy, especially considering everyone's going to buy it already so he hardly needs to advertise.<br /><br />The story opened up with a 10 year old kid, and I found myself wondering if SK has finally gotten too old to write children believably. He has written many child characters I've adored - The kids in It, Jake Chambers, Travelin' Jack, etc etc. The kid in this book, Pete, felt incongruous somehow. Not genuine. The story, about a car that's really an alien that eats people, was pretty stupid, but really, a lot of his stories sound stupid in description. I remember a short story about some plastic teeth that came to life and killed people and I liked that one. This one just felt contrived, like he didn't really care about it any more than I did as I was reading it.<br /><br />But what really got me, more than anything else, was the AT&T plug. The cop was playing Words With Friends on his iPad, internet provided by AT&T. That's almost exactly how he said it. I have a very hard time forgiving blatant product placement. It's bad enough on TV; it's worse in books. I don't see how SK could possibly need money and I'd be shocked to hear AT&T had ever inspired that kind of loyalty in anyone, to earn a mention like that. Reading it from my very favorite author of all time made me feel dirty.<br /><br />All in all, I wish I'd not read this story at all.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Viewing the Star Wars franchise throughout the years it seems that George is only interested in money, and yet he will miss out on the $$$ of his die hard fans by what he has done and continues to do with these films. So is he really only interested in money or is he just an idiot? In my sincere opinion I believe he's just a washed up has-been with no more vision, clinging on to a piece of Hollywood and popular culture - the really sad part is not only is he no longer talented or creative, he's just uncomfortably laughably bad.

B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Short attention span summary:<br /><br />1. Boy and girl meet<br />2. Boy and girl swear on Bible App. to get physical without strings attached<br />3. Boy and girl get physical, physical<br />4. It gets complicated.<br /><br />A rom-com with a difference, which is that you can probably get a guy to go see this with you without a complaint.  Though Mila Kunis probably has a lot to do with this, the R rating certainly helps a lot.<br /><br />Kunis shines as a New York recruiter for a job agency, who convinces Timberlake's character to move from LA to take up a job with GQ.  Both of them have emotional attachment issues, but as there is a strong attraction, they agree to embark on a physical attachment without the emotional baggage.<br /><br />We all know this isn't going to work, and although the ending is clearly, pellucidly obvious, just getting there is a lot of fun.  Undeniable chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis, as well as the inspired casting of Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jennings make for a deliciously decadent movie night.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 11, 2011
0765365278|5.0|This was an absolutely brilliant book. I'm really rather stunned at how much I loved it. The last bit of epic fantasy that I read was from George R.R. Martin, but the mature content prohibits a wider audience.    This, however, is entirely appropriate and truly fantastic. From the plotting to the characterization to the intricately detailed world-building, this is a masterpiece. Or, should I say, the first installment of a masterpiece.    Full review here: [...]
030788743X|5.0|When I found myself standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. I was in heaven. Each reference to the past was an incredible journey into my own childhood. This book has so many setting that are so vast and yet familiar. If you were any thing like me you will enjoy the journey as i did. Even the musical references are unforgettable. I wanted to been in the story so bad. Yes even as Mathew Broderick playing Galiga in a pizza joint.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a really nice bag for a day trip. It will hold a body with your longest lens mounted, a flash and 3 or 4 short lenses. I have battery grips on my cameras and this bag isn't deep enough for them. I also like to carry 2 digital bodies and 1 film body so this bag was just a little small for me. I ended up selling this bag to a friend who carries less equipment than I do so that worked out for the both of us. I wish Amazon made a larger version of this bag because the construction was very good, the shoulder straps were nicely padded and I liked the tripod straps on the side. All in all, a great bag.
B003L77GGK|4.0|LOVE Supernatural, but I did not finish out this season on television. I kept forgetting to watch it, which meant I wasn't too thrilled about the season from the beginning. I am looking forward to finishing out the season as I have been told that it has a fantastic ending. I prefer to watch the episodes back-to-back anyhow when they come out on dvd. The waiting a week for each episode is truly torture. I hope for season 7 they bring back the \\"sizzle\\" the past seasons had. Although Padalecki's sizzle keeps getting hotter!!! :)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Destroying \\"Star Wars\\" is nothing new for Lucas.He started way back when with \\"Return of the Jedi\\". Lucas didn't even create Star Wars all by himself as he likes to claim. Gary Kurtz helped him and came up with the better stuff. You can thank Gary Kurtz for how well \\"The Empire Strikes Back \\" Turned out. They had their falling out over the direction of \\"Return of the Jedi\\". Lucas sold out to the toy companies and Kurtz didn't like the influence that had over the direction of the film so he left and it's been garbage ever since. Read all about it here [...] Star Wars Blu Ray.......two big thumbs down

B003Y5HWGI|3.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\" is no longer as addictive as it once was and seems to be on its last legs and way past its prime.<br /><br />First, the good: The show seems to be a little racier this season, as when Bree shrieks \\"Get that thing away from me!\\" when confronted with a zucchini, following a night of marathon-sex with years-younger boytoy (Brian Austin Greene). Or when Gabby asks Lee to use the back door and he shoots back \\"I ALWAYS do!\\". Little moments like this kept me tuning in. And Teri Hatcher seems less annoying this year as well. Perhaps having her move off the Lane created more sympathy for the character. Lainie Kazan is wonderful as Susan's new landlady who runs a website called Va-Va-Va-Broom, featuring sexy women doing their housework in lingerie. With bills piling up and husband Mike on the verge of taking a job in Alaska, what's a desperate housewife to do but don the garters and heels?<br /><br />The annual \\"disaster\\" show has in the past brought us a tornado, plane crash and this year comes in the form of a street riot brought on by Paul Young's announcement he's opening a halfway house for ex-cons. And for this episode Wisteria Lane becomes Hysteria Lane and Susan is seriously injured and is faced with a major health crisis.<br /><br />Emily Bergi (Whom I was only familiar with from \\"The Rage: Carrie II\\") shows up as Paul Young's new wife, a prison groupie who sets up house with Fairview's creepiest citizen but causes tempers to flare when she won't perform her most important wifely duty. Bergi gets more likeable as the season goes on.<br /><br />The wonderful Harriet Samson Harris is back as the twisted Felicia Tillman though sometimes she's only onscreen for five seconds per episode.<br /><br />Now the bad: Vanessa Williams is a tired choice for a new foil. I wish the producers had went with an actress who has been hiding away for awhile rather than someone who just came off a four-year run on \\"Ugly Betty\\" playing an all-too similar character.<br /><br />Tom and Lynette are having marriage problems AGAIN, due to one of them being jealous of the other's career AGAIN. The writers are running out of ideas fast and it's never been more evident that it is watching this set.<br /><br />The show has already run its course and I am not sure it will be able to sustain itself for an entire season as we approach the final year. The more casual fans may want to rent this one instead of buying.<br /><br />***1/2 Three and a half stars.r /><br />Tom and Lynette are having marriage problems AGAIN, due to one of them being jealous of the other's career AGAIN.

B002UNMWAG|5.0|The original movie was grossly entertaining, and the second just continued the excitement of the first.  While adding more humor, the premise remains the same as the first.  Kick some butt & set the world right.  I was so happy to see all the original characters come back for the second, as well as the new.  Now I just need some rope!  :-)
B000H6SXMY|5.0|After extensive reading of other reviews, I decided to buy the individual season boxes for the following reasons:<br />1) too many reviews talked about defective discs that skipped or simply do not play at all,<br />2) I wanted the seasons in sequence - not scattered across several discs - ie out of sequence.<br />Buying the indivial season boxes cost me apx $42 more, however, it is worth having the episodes in sequence and reliable discs.

0307474712|4.0|The book is very close to movie so it wasn't a big deal to read it to understand the idea. Though it's nice and well-written, but I read it after \\"As Meat Loves Salt\\" so all the time going with Em and Dex I was thinking about more impressive book by Maria McCane.
0141034599|5.0|Here are some of the inconsistencies inside the book (the Penguin revised edition):-  1. Taleb put up a quiz to the graduate students about the odds of exceeding one standard deviation under the fat tail compared to the Gaussian (p. 357). His `right' answer is lower. In this sense, the odds of crash in the world of finance under any fat tail distribution should be even rarer than Gaussian; while the Gaussian already predicted that the occurrence of crash should have taken place every several billion lifetimes of the universe (p. 276). It does not make sense since the crisis happened almost every 10 years, from 1987 crash to 1997-8 Russian debt crisis and Asian financial turmoil, as well as 2008-9 Global financial crisis. Taleb seems to confuse the vanishingly small `contributions' of outliers to the overall Gaussian distribution (which should be interpreted as `probability' or `odds'), with the `impact' of the rare event to the `total' (which should be the expectation value.) (p. 357) Taleb explanation of the lower odds under fat tail because of its greater impact seems to be a bit tricky, as we should compare both distributions with the same amount of losses. To me, it is rather counter-intuitive as under any chosen tail the area under Gaussian should be lower than the fat-tail, not the reverse.  2. Taleb tried hard to snub Messrs of Blacks, Scholes and Merton about their Nobel-crowned formula by saying they merely made it \\"more acceptable\\" rather than they \\"invented\\" it, as Ed Thorp was an earlier person to mention it (p. 279). But it is also the author himself to say \\"it is those who derive consequences and seize the importance of the ideas, seeing their real value, who win the day.\\" His \\"godfather\\" B. Mandelbrot was not the first person to invent the pieces but to \\"connect the dots\\". Charles Darwin was also not the first person to \\"invent\\" the survival of the fittest. (p. 256) Therefore, it is not a valid denigration of BSM since it goes against his own words that there is nothing wrong to \\"dig out predecessors' work to back up their own claims\\". Also, when we \\"connect the dots\\", how do we avoid the narrative fallacy as the historians?   3. How do Taleb know he survives because \\"school of empirical medicine\\" wins over scholastics school? This statement also suffers from reverse engineering. (Water puddle problem)  4. One of the main themes of the book is \\"We just can't predict\\", while it is the human nature to plan or predict to satisfy one's own psychological needs. Thus Taleb suggested us \\"Just be a fool in the right places\\" (p. 203), instead of total avoidance of planning/forecasting.  a. But what do we do with Mandelbrotian modeling? We can't rely on them for any precision when it comes to forecasting, as long as their function is merely to show us the locations of Black Swan, or to make Black Swan grey. Taleb owed us a little more light on what to do with a right map if Mandelbrotian happens to be one, so long as we are pretty sure the Gaussian is wrong in Extremistan finance world.  b. When it comes to \\"small\\" things, we are better to \\"be human\\". When it comes to our possessions, career or train schedule, all of which should be no \\"bigger\\" things in Taleb's mind, we are better off to practice stoicism as \\"missing a train is painless\\", which itself is rather inhumane in my opinion as it takes extra energy not to care. Paradox arises here.  5. Taleb proposed the respect for Mother Nature and \\"things that have worked for a long time are preferable\\" since \\"they are more likely to have reached their ergodic states\\" (p. 371). But it is also the same Taleb who developed the main theme of the book - the Black Swan with the \\"problem of induction\\" that \\"No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white\\" (From Taleb's first book \\"Fooled by Randomness\\"). Our mere thousand years civilization with records of observations of Mother Nature may mislead us to see \\"White Swans\\" as \\"ergodic states\\". Our blind belief of representation of Mother Nature may also lead us to \\"problem of induction\\".

B000UVT3OI|5.0|So I'm a pretty big fan of Garth Brooks' music but I'm pretty irritated at his arrogance towards the digital music industry.  He won't release any of his music on here in mp3 form nor will he release anything on itunes.  Additionally, if you go on Youtube, it's hard to find his songs that haven't been taken down for copyright. Is he so greedy that he will only allow you to buy his physical CD's if you want his music?  Who died and made this clown king of all music?  C'mon Garth, you're better than that!!!!..even the Beatles finally caved and released their stuff in digital format..and they are way bigger than you will ever be.
B0052FG8KO|5.0|For any number of reasons, an artists second album can all too often turn into that unthankful burden known as the \\"Sophomore Jinx\\". AOR/Westcoast heroes Work Of Art (Robert Säll, Herman Furin & Lars Säfsund) trample that worry into dust with the unmitigated success of their mesmerizing follow-up album entitled IN PROGRESS. They've taken the best magical elements of their debut disc ARTWORK and elevated things to a new, vibrant level of musical urgency and execution.   On IN PROGRESS, Work Of Art pays homage to bands like Journey, Giant & Toto while also making their own mark and taking their rightful place as the premiere sophisticated modern AOR band of our time. Every single note of this fresh and contemporary disc is glittering within the stellar songwriting that pushes the vocals and musicianship to new and exciting stages. Lars Säfsund's soaring voice along with Herman Furin's thunderous rhythms and Robert Säll's frantic and resourceful guitar skills show that this band possesses a musical depth with fuel to burn. Hard driving songs like \\"The Rain\\", \\"Never Love Again\\" and \\"Emelie\\" deliver what is now the WOA signature sound. Other portions that jump out during the initial run through are things like the blistering guitar solo that ornaments the outstanding track \\"Nature Of The Game\\", the mid-tempo compositions like \\"Once Again\\" & \\"'Fall Down\\" (with Robert Säll's fantastic piano foundation) and the acoustic guitar riffs that build into \\"Castaway\\".   After hearing IN PROGRESS, what this band has been able to accomplish is simply extraordinary as they've squeezed every bit of muscle out of what they had to work with in the studio. In this case, praises to the skies are absolutely justified. Work Of Art is the model in the AOR/Westcoast genre and it's impossible not to get excited when contemplating the kind of music that lies ahead from them.

The second time, however, when I picked them up to put them on over my head, I heard a snap and two pieces instead of one!!! Both of the earpieces swivel right above each ear phone (which are unto themselves severely uncomfortable). This causes the joint to be much smaller and much weaker than the rest of the much thicker frame. If you are going to spend this much money, pay $20 more and get the official PS3 wireless headset.

0788815490|5.0|Simply stunning; that is precisely how I felt when finishing `The Wings of the Dove'.  This is a film that defines a genre with such class and sophistication, and it still carries on with a unique vision that sets it apart from the genre's tendency to become rather repetitious and familiar.  `The Wings of the Dove' is a must see film for any fan of period dramas, but it is more than that.<br /><br />The plot is complex and emotionally interwoven.  You have the young and vibrant Kate, in love with a poor journalist named Merton, who is controlled by her manipulative Aunt.  Her Aunt is very wealthy and threatens to cut Kate lose if she follows her heart and marries Merton.  Worse yet is the fact that Kate's Aunt is financially taking care of Kate's father, and she threatens to cut him off as well if Kate doesn't do as she wishes.  What she wishes is for Kate to marry the wealthy Lord Mark.  Mark is infatuated with Kate, but he also wishes to marry an American heiress named Millie.  Millie is close to death and is sure to leave her fortunes to whomever she weds, and so Mark is eager to get his hands on her money.  Kate sees another opportunity.  After befriending Kate and hearing of her interest in Merton, Kate persuades him to seduce her, making her final days happy and securing enough money for Kate and Merton to be independent from her pesky Aunt.<br /><br />What Kate never counted on was that Morten actually fall in love with Millie.<br /><br />All performances here are rather outstanding, especially Helena Bonham Carter, who with merely a small emotional inflection can emote so much.  Her final scene alone is phenomenally played and completely destroys the audience.  Linus Roache is sublime as Merton, and Alison Elliott is devastating and wholly endearing as Millie.<br /><br />The plots twisted emotional relevance is accompanied brilliantly by lavish costumes and stunning cinematography that carry the film to new heights.  This is one of the greatest period `costume' dramas of the 90's, a decade that sported some of the finest in cinematic history (`Howard's End' possibly being the very best).<br /><br />I highly recommend this!cade that sported some of the finest in cinematic history (`Howard's End' possibly being the very best).

0470876417|5.0|Our consulting firm has been using this technique for years, but this is the first time I've seen it formally documented. This method works well no matter what the business domain or scope. The material in this book is presented in an extremely straight-forward manner.  The practitioner can be getting results quickly in terms of achieving stakeholder buy-in at various levels of the organization. The top down approach ensures that you gain stakeholder understanding and agreement first at the higher and more abstract levels of the organization before progressing to the more detailed levels, thereby minimizing the risk of misunderstandings and rework.
0783226845|3.0|As a whole, `Scent of a Woman' is rather endearing and it possesses a level of charm I really didn't expect.  On the other hand, there are parts of this film that are genuinely terrible.  It's hard to decide my concrete feelings because the film is wildly uneven.  The entire closing segment (or really anything pertaining to the `troubles at school') is an eye-rolling waste of celluloid, and yet the majority of the antics in New York City (especially that beloved tango scene) are fun and witty and enchanting to tell you the truth.  It's just that the film loses itself in a sloppy closing (yes, it's terrible in more than one way) that betrays some of the honesty (if you can call it that) that the film was reaching for.<br /><br />I'll yell SPOILERS, just in case.<br /><br />The film revolves around a retired Lieutenant Colonel named Frank Slade.  Frank is a bitter, blind alcoholic who resents his life and his family.  He is living in a guest house behind his niece's home since Veteran housing was not to his liking.  He has burnt many bridges in his family, and his prickly demeanor makes it difficult for him to interact with others.  In walks Charlie, a young prep school student looking for some extra cash in order to afford a plane ticket home for Christmas.  He answers an ad to basically babysit Slade for Thanksgiving weekend so that his niece and her family can go on vacation.  Little does Charlie know, but Slade has other plans.  Shortly after his niece is gone, a taxi arrives taking both Slade and Charlie to the airport.  They are going on a little trip to New York City, where Slade plans on reuniting with his brother, eating at a fine restaurant, making love to a beautiful woman and then killing himself.  Charlie isn't really keen on the whole idea, but the last part especially concerns him.  Frank is very persuasive though (or should I say `aggressive') and so Charlie bends to his wishes.<br /><br />For the most part, the film excels while in New York City.  The relationship that blossoms between both Frank and Charlie is sweet and sincere.  The fears that corrode Frank's demeanor are believable; I just wish that they were addressed a little more authentically (his sudden shift at the close of their trip is a little too abrupt for it to feel honest).  Sure, some parts can seem a tad hokey (like the Ferrari scene) but they work in the atmosphere created for the film.  It's just that the entire `school' subplot is so ridiculous that it drags the entire film into an area it didn't need to go.  The closing `hearing' itself was kind of disgusting, and Pacino's monologue is overdone and the reaction afterwards was unintentionally hilarious.  The site reviewer was correct when he made the connection to `The Dead Poets Society' (another film that makes me roll my eyes).  I was just waiting for the students to hoist Frank and Charlie on their shoulders and carry them out of the auditorium.<br /><br />And then there is Pacino.  I hate what he's been reduced to.  He basically plays a caricature of his own persona in every film.  I will say this; I totally understand why he won the Oscar for this.  First of all, he is ridiculously convincing at playing blind.  Second, he has all the right `scenes' to win an Oscar (he tries to kill himself, he insults everyone around him, he gets drunk, he saves the day...HE YELLS).  Third, he was overdue by a large margin.  But, with all that said, if we are basing this on the merit of the performance alone; he was far too uneven here.  In fact, the only scene that really felt genuine and just perfect was that tango scene.  He was marvelous there, but Pacino often reverted to his overacting and yelling and overselling everything to the point where he felt phony.  I understand the whole `character' thing, but there is such a thing as subtlety, and there were so many opportunities to use subtlety to convey a deeper emotion in Frank (especially when he's breaking down about his life).  A scene that really works thanks to some subtlety on Pacino's part is the scene at his brother's home.  I just wish that he had expounded on that side of Frank a little more.<br /><br />He's not bad, but Eastwood, Rae, Downey Jr. and especially Washington were all better than him.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I liked this movie.  I'd watch it again.  I'd even recommend it.  But, the film is not great, and it barely makes `good' when you look at it as a whole.  If you can delete the last twenty minutes from your mind you may have a really good buddy flick.y on Pacino's part is the scene at his brother's home.

B005HJAOLY|3.0|I have to say I have mixed feelings about this book.  What I liked:  As the actual \\"horror\\" story is taking place, waiting to see if this person or that one would react in any way. I liked the children (I always like King's children I think)    The ending just left me hanging too much.  I won't give away any spoilers but it was just disappointing.  It ended, yes but without some explanation but then again it's King, what should I expect.    But the preview for the next book 11/22/63 sounds terrific. Except very expensive for a Kindle book.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I really thought that I would hate this album.  I mean, this is Britney, and while she has a certain level of appeal, she's never been the most credible pop superstar.  As far as Britney's career is concerned, she has always landed on her feat because production on her tracks are as slick as they come, and while peers like Christina Aguilera continually challenge their aesthetic and rely on their vocal range to draw in listeners, Britney has always lived by the motto that `if you give the people a bass heavy beat that makes them bob their head and grind up on the chick in front of them then they will come en-mass to buy your product'.  That motto is a good one, since her vocal range is certainly limited.  She needs hot hip-hop producers to created larger than life canvases for her serviceable talent.<br /><br />`Blackout' really doesn't disappoint; at all.<br /><br />Songs like `Freakshow' and `Get Naked' ooze with sex appeal and Britney purrs like a kitten ready to pounce.  She understands that no one has forgotten her school girl outfit from the start of her career, and she amps it up with slick beats and lyrics that depict a sweaty seductress ready to please you anyway she can.  She gets in perfect groove on `Radar', a song that may be the finest thing she's ever done.  It's catchy and fun, flirtatious in all the `Toxic' kind of ways with texture that bursts at the seams.  `Hot as Ice' has a real catchy old school vibe that sucks you in immediately.  It is playful and plays to a different side of Britney's persona.  Her whiney-esque vocals lend a nice tone to the track.  Songs like `Toy Soldier' and `Ooh Ooh Baby' are aggressive and easily likable.  `Break the Ice' is fun and explodes with syth background music that is memorable.  `Perfect Lover' doesn't really `pop' but it haunts.  It just has this something that lingers; maybe it's the way that Britney attacks it with a strange subtlety, and those verse lines are flawless.<br /><br />`Why Should I Be Sad' is the only real `balad-esque' type song on the album, and it kind of fails to be anything special.<br /><br />The two radio singles off this album (`Gimme More' and `Piece of Me') are fun, if not a tad overplayed.  `Gimme More' is especially catchy, and that slinky downplayed beat is ridiculously awesome.  I love that she points the finger at her own ridiculousness in `Piece of Me', but in the process she sheds light on what drives her to that side of crazy.<br /><br />The greatest thing about `Heaven on Earth' is that it is so 80's Euro-Pop and it works like MAGIC!<br /><br />So, in the end; this album kind of nails it.  I thought that it would be terrible, but yet again I find that Britney defies common sense and delivers yet another top-notch pop album that doesn't break any new ground or become anything truly profound but remains wholly listenable and completely likable from start to finish.<br /><br />My personal ranking; for those of you interested:<br /><br />1) Radar<br />2) Freakshow<br />3) Hot as Ice<br />4) Heaven on Earth<br />5) Perfect Lover<br />6) Break the Ice<br />7) Get Naked<br />8) Ooh Ooh Baby<br />9) Gimme More<br />10) Piece of Me<br />11) Toy Soldier<br />12) Why Should I Be Sad' type song on the album, and it kind of fails to be anything special.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well, George Lucas ruins star wars once again with added scenes and voice overs. At least include the original theatrical version! This = 1 star! Original theatrical version = 5 stars!
B004EPYZUI|4.0|The first time I watched this, I was amazed by the effects work and the story was a bit by-the-side. But the next day I started to think about the movie more and more and in the end went out and bought the extended cut to watch again. The extra footage helps the story along much better than the theatrical cut and I like the fact that this isn't your typical Hollywood sunshine-fest of happy endings, unicorns and flowers. I know American audiences like the sickly sweet taste of the happy ending but it's really just not necessary in every movie.  So yes, this is a dark movie and the other reviews will tell you more about the plot and extra scenes and so on, but I think this is a sleeper hit. I know it wasn't big in cinemas but I think as word gets around it'll do some decent sales on DVD and BluRay. The story is good (not brilliant), with a good conclusion and a good message - you're in full control of your own destiny. The method by which we get to that conclusion is fantastical and brilliant. Yes, the movie is deep in eye candy for the guys, but the effects work, wire work with the stunts and fight scenes, and the overall look and feel of the movie is brilliant. If you're looking for a good bit-sized example of what I mean by the \\"style\\", cut to the end of the dragon fantasy sequence where BabyDoll jumps into the air and the camera travels along the blade of the sword, then zooms out to frame her against the dragon's fire in super-slow-motion before she drops to deliver the kill.  A couple of words about the sound and picture quality - all top notch with very few dark moment compression artifacts. The sound is good, the music is well balanced and the overall audio presentation is pretty nice. The only downside is the digital copy has some noticable compression artifacts in it in the darker scenes but then it is showing you the same movie with less than one quarter the information so you can't expect miracles.    Conclusion: if you're into more cerebral sci-fi and fantasy, this is worth a rental at least. If you want to see the sun come up and everyone skip home holding hands with jaunty music at the end, best look elsewhere.
0470449748|4.0|Book was delivered on time and was in the condition advertised.<br /><br />This book is great in preparing for the GMAT because it has hundreds of exercise questions and answers for both Verbal and Math. And the exercise problems are retired real GMAT questions. So this gives you a real good exposure to the real thing, and lots of experience.<br /><br />To time yourself and to mimic the real test scenario, i would suggest a different book, but for lots of exercise questions, to get good practice and exposure, this is probably the best book!<br /><br />Thanks!

0553384775|5.0|The Wolf Of Wall Street is an amazing story of the high highs and low low lows experienced by a brilliant young millionaire who slowly blurs the line between a normal life and insanity.  Filled with riveting recounts ranging from making millions in a few hours to cocaine fuelled nights with hookers blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars, it was hard to put this book down.  It is so well written that it is easy to track with all events, and described so that you feel as if you're there.  Jordan Belfort pours out many sincere and shameful life changing actions in vivid and sometimes hilarious detail, giving a true authenticity to this autobiogrpahy.  Inspiring to the very end, I couldn't help but feel some sort of connection with the author and a sort of empathy for what he put himself and his family through.  For any young entrepreneurs out there, or anyone who just enjoys a good book, this is a must read and has a definite message.    Well worth the money, containing easily a lifetime of lessons in less than 500 pages.
1609611543|5.0|As a low-carb dieter since 2004 when I weighed in at 410 pounds, I've been conscious of the kind of carbohydrates I have allowed to pass my lips. And for many years I concentrated on avoiding what I thought were the biggest carbohydrate culprits in my diet--namely sugar, refined carbohydrates, fast food, junk food, and starchy foods. But when I noticed I was doing everything perfectly fine and still dealing with some added weight, it made me stop and wonder what else could be going on.<br /><br />Enter WHEAT BELLY by Dr. William Davis.<br /><br />Although I've never been diagnosed with Celiac disease or have a requirement to cut whole grains from my diet, this so-called \\"healthy\\" food is probably not as healthy as most of us believe. It's the opposite of what we have seen with saturated fat which has been vilified as a dastardly part of the human diet on obesity, diabetes and heart disease. At the same time the lipophobes have been running rampant in nutritional health, the whole grain goons have been pushing these on the public as a food to be consumed in large quantities. In fact, even the U.S. Dietary Guidelines put whole grains up on a pedestal as a food that Americans should be consuming lots of. But at what cost to our health?<br /><br />Dr. Davis brilliantly outlines the case against consuming wheat specifically stating that the modern-day wheat is just a strange mutation of the wheat of our grandmother just 50 years ago. The genetically-altered version is especially dangerous to our health because of the impact on blood sugar (much greater than even table sugar), massive weight gain (thus, the title of this book), to the development of diabetes, heart disease, and dementia. This cardiologist has had his eyes opened by what he has seen in his own patients over the years and now he's sounding the alarm to prevent future generations from dealing with the ramifications of this seemingly harmless food.<br /><br />There are delicious recipes and instructions on how to begin your low-carb, wheat-free lifestyle in WHEAT BELLY and I highly recommend it to people with Celiac disease, obesity, diabetes, and virtually any other chronic disease. If you're still eating wheat thinking it's good for you, then it's time to open your eyes to the truth lest one of these conditions befalls you.free lifestyle in WHEAT BELLY and I highly recommend it to people with Celiac disease, obesity, diabetes, and virtually any other chronic disease.

0393325172|5.0|I first read this book several years ago after I had seen the movie. I very much enjoyed the movie and its cast of characters and complex/subtle plot.<br /><br />I quickly realized that the books written by O'Brian were also complex and subtle with the author cracking obvious puns ('two weavels', 'Cacafuego') and then subtle jibes (Maturin observing that he believes himself to have become tolerably nautical).<br /><br />The battles, the intrigues (romantic, political, military), the fantastic naval details all create a realistic, immersive world for Jack and Stephen. The strong friendship between Jack and Stephen (captain and doctor, respectively) is really the cornerstone of the series, in my opinion.<br /><br />This book set me on the path to reading the entire 20 book series plus the one unfinished title that O'Brian had started at the time of his death. If you decide to go the recorded book path, then I definitely recommend using Audible and getting the versions recorded with Patrick Tull.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book and this series.

0446556750|5.0|Outstanding!  Michael Connelly has done a fantastic job here, combining, in a way that satisfies both my Mickey Haller ([[ASIN:1455500232 The Lincoln Lawyer]]) and Detective Harry Bosch ([[ASIN:0316069418 The Drop (Harry Bosch)]]) cravings with aplomb.  Connelly has crafted what I can only hope is only an appetizer.  I'm eagerly awaiting the other courses.<br /><br />The title refers both to a case where the verdict, after nearly a quarter century, is reversed on appeal, and to Mickey Haller \\"crossing the aisle\\" to prosecute the retrial.  Working \\"for the other side\\" is difficult to the point where he even refers to himself in court as the defense momentarily.  His \\"second chair\\" is his prosecutor ex-wife, Maggie McPherson, and his investigator is, at his insistence, Harry Bosch.<br /><br />(So, Perry Mason has to morph into Doug Selby, and faces A.B. Carr, a tricky Perry Mason style defense attorney painted as the bad guy.)  In other words, Mickey faces off against a defense attorney who pulls every trick, just as Haller would, were he across the aisle.<br /><br />The detective work, the preparation and execution of the pre-trial planning keeps your attention and the courtroom scenes are no letdown--you just want to keep reading.<br /><br />I don't want to give a single thing away, so I'll just tell you to get the book!
6302800420|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it as a kid and when I saw it offered on amazon so inexpensively, I had to add it to my (ever growing) movie collection.  I love Dustin Hoffman.  He's a great actor and is the only one I could see doing the part of the main character.  If you need a laugh on a lazy Saturday afternoon, find a copy of Tootsie, sit back with some popcorn and enjoy classic comedy at its best.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Return to OZ's PG Rating is appropriate.  You may have reservations showing it to 5 year olds and less because of the scary business of electric shock treatments scenes in the beginning. (Maybe you can fast forward so the kiddies don't see it?) It's definitely not the Disney films of today.  Kids older than 6 should love it, they are exposed to so much more today than I did when I was as kid.     I was an adult when I first watched this movie back in the 80's.  I was at a party and someone wanted to go watch the next OZ movie at a local theater and I tagged along.  I've always loved the concept of \\"OZ\\" and have soaked up the movies and books that I've come across over the years.  So for this reason I thought that this movie would continue the nostalgia I had with both the first book and 1939 movie.  This was not the case because I fell asleep four times and had to be kicked out of the theater for snoring. However, I did learn to love \\"Return to OZ\\" once it came around to a local cinema who played it every Saturday morning on the big screen.   A friend of mine had kids and he needed help with getting them there and back so I watched it at least five times.  His kids were mesmerized every time they went and gasped when Dorothy and friends fell out a crumbling \\"Gump\\" whose rope was coming undone.   During the last few times I watched it I actually studied the nuances of the concepts why \\"Gump\\" exists, reason for \\"OZMA\\", and why Dorothy even mattered in OZ.  (I know the books are better - I'm just saying that you can deduce the subtle plots from the movie).     This movie attempts to marry (sort of) L.F. Baum's two books \\"Return to OZ\\" and \\"OZMA of OZ\\". Dorothy (Fairuza Balk) gets a call back and returns to OZ via a bad storm. The munchkins are gone, yellow road is torn up, and the emerald city is basically toast, but the inhabitants meeting up Dorothy seem to think she can save the day.  Does she dream this or does she actually go there? It's hard to tell until the endof the movie. It had state of the art special effects back then (Claymation and beginning graphics (not the CGI graphics you have now)) and delightful enhancements that attempt to employ your imagination.  This is the reason that I keep watching this movie ever so often. I was glad to find this movie on DVD at Amazon for a reasonable price. I'll have it as long as I have a DVD player that will play it!
0316056863|5.0|My sister in law and wife both read this book. They enjoyed it very much and esp since they are fans of hers. Well written book.
0553801473|4.0|I have enjoyed the book as well as disappointed by it. GRRM writes very well, and in terms of quality, the book deserves at least four stars. But if we are taking the whole series into perspective, it has definitely gone downhill. The author is mired in the bog of characters and plot lines that can go forever without any resolution. But at least, George Martin has one good recipe here - death.<br /><br />Killing of the major characters was a vehicle for moving the plot since the book 1. Like lady Melisandre, who needs to sacrifice a person of royal blood to conjure her magic, George Martin needs to kill off someone important to shock readers and propel the plot in a new direction. Alas, it is becoming clear by now that all or almost all expendable characters are already dead.<br /><br />[Little spoilers ahead]<br />I presume that many important characters like Jaime, Tyrion, Cersei, Ser Barristan Selmi, Theon, Asha and Littlefinger have to die at some point - but not before they play out they role in the plot. At the current rate, however, I expect them to have a long and interesting lives. Perhaps even longer ones than mine or George Martin's own...
B000053VJI|5.0|Some of the best hits ever! Love this album.  Bought it twice, one for my mom and one for myself.
B0055HVDZ4|4.0|Pros:  - Nice, faithful replica of original WB LP packaging.  Inside poster is included, with nicely detailed colors/reproduction.  - Came well packaged, well protected, with no signs of shipping damage    Cons:  - The inner sleve (where the actual LP is housed) came a little tight, and it was hard to get out of the cover, and get back in, too.  It seems like a problem from the original manufacturer (Rhino) than the shipper.  - The sound of the actual LP is kind of muddy, if you compare it with the European versions I have heard, both in CD and in LP.  Still, that's the way I remembered it sounding, from the original WB CD.  If you preference is towards brighty LP, then this version is not for you.  - This is not the quietest vinyl I have received from Rhino.  That would go to Master of Reality (reissue) and Black Sabbath S/T (reissue).  This is a little behind them in that department.  Cracks and pops audible at gaps between songs.
B000M9L7KQ|5.0|It's easy to look down your nose at the Model T when you have a Transam or a Corvette, or an SUV or truck for that matter.  However, in the day of the Model T, it was something to which everyone aspired.<br /><br />So too we have an entire class of album that was more common and popular in the 1970's than before or since, the story theme album.  Epitomized by Jeff Wayne's outstanding \\"War of the Worlds,\\" the story album is the concept album taken taken to an extreme, setting a story in a music framework.  Rick Wakeman tried several variants on this style of album, with probably \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" and \\"Return to the Centre of the Earth\\" being the most story-like.<br /><br />With so few entries in this genre, by definition the few that exist are the best. How fortunate that \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" really is good.  I recall listening to the vinyl version of this album often in the mid-1970's, along with a large group of nerdy electronics technicians, because the structure and uniqueness of the music appealed to us. The synthesizers Rick Wakeman used were state-of-the-art at the time, and his skill was phenomenal.<br /><br />As I listen to the music now, I can readily place the music in the 1970's.  The riffs and arrangement have a 1970's flavor.  Regardless, the music still retains its appeal.  There are so many influences in this music that it would be difficult to point out half of them.  Certainly Rick brought his Yes influences.  You could perhaps feel a bit of Hendrix in spots, maybe some Moody Blues, perhaps even a bit of Isaac Hayes.  Throw that in with an orchestra and you have something that at that time was very progressive.<br /><br />Okay, the lyrics are nothing to write home about.  They are simple, almost juvenile.  Fortunately, the lyrics are not the main attraction; the music is.  The lyrics do tell part of the story about the journey to the center of the earth, so you should still understand what the singer is saying.<br /><br />Other than the other story albums of the time, and the more symphonic productions of Yes, the closest album I can think of similar to this in terms of style is The Moody Blues \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" which is completely different in concept.<br /><br />Given the goal of the album, I think that the music is well-matched to the goal.  The music is not over-blown or pretentious.  However, recall that much symphonic music is by its nature overblown and pretentious.  Consider, as an example, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.  Definitely overblown and pretentious. And who cares? It's good music well done.<br /><br />As with much of the music I enjoy, this album is not for everyone.  It is a niche album for those who like the fusion of rock and classical, with synthesizers and a story thrown in for good measure.  A variety of styles are in this album, including Rick Wakeman's unique style.  If you are still unsure whether you would like this, borrow a copy or download a portion from someone and give it a listen.  If Yes and The Moody Blues are your idea of exciting music, I'm betting this album will soon be on your list of good, if not great, music.s of the time, and the more symphonic productions of Yes, the closest album I can think of similar to this in terms of style is The Moody Blues \\"Days of Future Passed,\\" which is completely different in concept.

B000A59PMO|5.0|I'm usually not one for over-exeggeration, but this single piece of entertainment, IMHO, is the finest season that I've yet to witness. Everything about it was hitting on all cylinders. It goes without saying that \\"Veronica Mars\\" is one of the greatest series of the last 20 years, although criminally overlooked. If one can get past the premise (I mean, if the premise of a young blonde girl slaying vampires leads to every single publication calling it one of the greatest shows ever created, you definitely shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I've learned that from none other than \\"Buffy\\"), they will find themselves with a suspenseful, detailed, and completely surprising mystery on their hands, with humor and character developement to boot. The second season is underrated, IMO, and the third season left us a little bit on the empty side, due to network interference, and network interference only. But this season is a masterpiece, and you will be hooked from the first episode on. BUY THE ENTIRE SERIES!

The first shock was that it didn't even seem to be written by the same author.  Did Mr. Martin use a ghost writer this time around?  No humor, no mystery, no point.  Did not even recognize the characters.  Start over, issue a retraction, rewrite book 5.

0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins creates a world that is unique and separate, yet intimately familiar to our own in Hunger Games. A young woman whose father has died and her mother debilitated by depression Katniss has had to take care of her mother and baby sister growing up way to quickly in a world where the young don't stay young for long. Devoted completely to her family and with a deep love for her sister; she sacrifices her own life for that of her sister Primrose in the Hunger Games a reality show that means instant death.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a reality show for those in the privileged first district, taking children from the other twelve districts and making them fight to the death. The children from District 13, where Katniss is, generally die as this is a poor district that can not prepare or support their children in this fight. Katniss willingly enters the Hunger Games to save her sister. What follows is an incredible story of fear, hope, loss, and war. It will hold your attention completely and if you take my advice you'll buy the trilogy at once because you're going to want to read all three at once.

0375703861|3.0|I would enthuse wildly, but there's nothing to enthuse about. I would bash, but there's not much to bash. I'm pretty much 'meh' about this book. I expected more.    The first time I saw White Teeth it was in a huge ad on the side of my favorite bookstore. I looked at it, read whatever was written underneath and decided it was probably a serious book about racial issues, so I wasn't really interested. Incidentally, I was wrong about the first part. The book's a comedy through and through. But it's still about racial issues.    So eventually, when it was one of the options on my reading list for a Master's class and one of my colleagues recommended it with approximately the same enthusiasm I save for my own very dearest books, I decided I'd give it a try. The many favorable blurbs and awards were also in its favor.    The way the book starts is light, humorous. Perhaps a bit too much. I like my books to have realism, to delve into the psychology of characters, to sparkle. I want to feel that things are real even when they're entirely unrealistic - which is what the first pages of the book entirely failed to do. Still, a deliberate lack of realism is a style in itself, so I tried to get over my disappointment.    Mostly, the first part of the book feels like a rushed comedy. Imitated accents, characters sketched rather than portrayed, all sorts of unrealistic happenings, weird tics, but a humor that saves the day, I suppose. I can understand the appeal the book had to the critics: post-modernism, today's cultural movement, is intensely political. It just loves its minorities, colonials, race differences, culture clash and whatnot, sometimes to the point where the art trails behind the ideology. And if it's something this book has, it's minorities (religious, cultural, racial). There's Jamaicans and Jews, English and Bangladeshi, black, white, Islam, Jehova's Witnesses, scientists and just people off the street... It seems to have everything. For the first hundred pages, my question was just \\"Why?\\" The plot was contrived, the characters flat, everything essentially seemed to be there just to make the cultural clash humor go on.    Later, however, Smith starts to get into it. Her characters gain some weight, some greater motivation, some personality. Not a lot, mind you. Just enough so they can function as people and you can understand their motivation and their decisions. You can feel life seeping into these people, mostly when the second generation - Archie's daughter and his best friend's twin sons - come into play. The characters start bouncing off on each other in all sorts of ways, there's a generation clash, much sexuality that is hard to handle (not that we ever get to actually feel it, but just observe its effects on the characters) and a ton of problems that spring everywhere, which are handled not in the best of ways.    Overall, however, the book doesn't do it for me. The characters are mostly observed from the outside, like in family photos, not really seen from the inside. The plot seems to exist on and off, to have no real point in existing. Even though in the last pages somebody gets shot, there's no real climax, no ending.    ...meh. I'm too disappointed and neutral about it to come up with anything more interesting to say...

This was a thrill a minute roller coaster ride.   This would be a perfect book for teens as well as adults although there are one or two references that some might object to.   I highly recommend this book.   It is not too deep, but boy it is action packed and fun.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I had high expectations of this film and it did not let me down in the slightest. First off, I must say that the Blu-ray is one of the clearest I have seen. The soundtrack of the film is amazing to say the least and I instantly downloaded it after the film. The Chemical Brothers do an amazing job. Probably their best work.<br /><br />The film is very original and tells a story of a young girl, Hanna, who was raised by her father and trained to fight and support herself. They live out in the middle of nowhere, they hunt their own food and are cut off from any civilization. Hanna is curious as to the outside world and music and people, however he father discourages her of this. After a while her father presents a box with a switch to Hanna. He further explains that someone will come to find them if she flips the switch. She of course flips it and teams of bad guys and helicopters show up. The father takes off and leaves Hanna to fend for herself. She is captured and taken to a facility, but is that part of the plan?<br /><br />Over-all Hanna blew me away. It is original, however ideals from past films do shine through the plot at times. The cinematography is superb and the music is very well built into the actions on the screen. The locations are also very carefully and brilliantly chosen. I was highly impressed and cannot wait to watch this film again. In a sea of horrible movies which are pushed out each week, Hanna excels as one of the best movies I have seen this year. Highly recommended.
1582406723|5.0|Robert Kirkman is the new King of the Zombie genre.  I could care less if it angers the hardcore legions who cling to the flag planted by George A Romero over thirty years ago.  In no way does that diminish Romero or his importance any more than the Beatles to Elvis or Lady Gaga to Madonna.  I am simply stating that the crown and scepter have been passed.<br />I've been accused of having a \\"man-crush\\" on Kirkman.  Don't care.  From the moment I cracked open The Walking Dead, I felt I was seeing something special.  It was a feeling that hasn't been replicated since that chilly September afternoon in 1979 when I walked into Tanasbourne Mall and took my aisle seat for a double feature (back when theaters showed two movies together).  The headliner was actually Beyond the Door, followed by Dawn of the Dead.<br />For those of you who wait for the comic book run to finish and get compiled into a single volume graphic novel (like me), I will be reviewing all of the Kirkman series.  That said, let's start with Volume One: Days Gone Bye.<br />The story begins very reminiscent of 28 Days Later.  Our central protagonist, Rick Grimes, is a policeman shot in the line of duty.  He wakes up in the hospital to a world quite different from before.  After finding his wife and son gone, he heads to Atlanta thinking that they might've gone to the city on government advice and that is where his wife's family live.<br />Things only get worse for Rick as he discovers that the zombie problem is far beyond epidemic stage.  Shortly after reaching Atlanta, he meets up with a band of survivors camped outside of town.  It just so happens that his partner, wife, and son are in this group.<br />The rest of the story serves as a well-crafted introduction to the cast of characters.  There are some distinct personalities in the group and some nicely placed underlying tension.  Enough cannot be said about Charlie Adlard, and Cliff Rathburn's artwork.  He renders an assortment of facial expressions that truly help to convey a range of emotions from smoldering jealousy to snarky disapproval.  You really get a vibe from the group as well as the individuals.<br />Episode 1 leaves the reader in shock.  The conclusion is so startling and, when you take the time to ponder it, viscerally upsetting.  By the last page, it is clear that you, the reader, are witnessing something special.  Day's Gone Bye is a wonderful gateway in a world that Robert Kirkman has masterfully crafted.  He does not earn the title King from one entry, but since this is a series of reviews, I will act as spoiler only in saying that by the time I reach episode 5, I'd made up my mind.  All hail the new King of Zombie horror.vey a range of emotions from smoldering jealousy to snarky disapproval.  You really get a vibe from the group as well as the individuals.

By the last page, it is clear that you, the reader, are witnessing something special.  Day's Gone Bye is a wonderful gateway in a world that Robert Kirkman has masterfully crafted.  He does not earn the title King from one entry, but since this is a series of reviews, I will act as spoiler only in saying that by the time I reach episode 5, I'd made up my mind.  All hail the new King of Zombie horror.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|If Michael Jackson were to put out a rap album, this is what it would be like.  The production and sound stage is excellent and the beats are seamless.  He also raps about real life problems that everyone can relate to.  Everything on this album works and works well.  Very high quality, unique, cutting edge, and timeless.  Forget the mp3 download, this album deserves to be bought as hard copy.
B005HS00V4|5.0|Get a big screen TV, turn up the volume, push play. The next thing you know it will be over. The orchestral arrangements are so compelling and powerful that you can do little other than submit to them and not notice time passing by. I've seen the live concert a couple of times. In the theater I heard textural details in the mix that I didn't notice live, despite the live sound being great too. Details that, as a composer, blew me away. If you have a good sound system, and let yourself just be drawn in, you won't miss the drums and theater of previous tours. The visual effects are first rate anyway - no gimmicks required. The sound in the theater was as first rate as movie theater sound gets, so I would expect nothing less on a good home theater system.    The 3D in the theater was very effective.    In addition to PG fans, this is a MUST BUY for anyone into orchestral music or who wants an introduction to creative orchestral textures!

0740748475|5.0|I grew up reading Calvin and Hobbes, and remember being devastated when I learned that Bill Watterson would no longer be drawing my favorite strip anymore.  On a trip back to my parent's house a while back I discovered a few of the dog eared Calvin and Hobbes books that I read repeatedly, and remember that someone had told me about The Complete Calvin and Hobbes a few years earlier, so I jumped at the chance to buy it.  In reading it again, I've realized that I almost CERTAINLY didn't get half of the humor in the strips, which made reading it over again almost like a new experience.  Watterson did things with Calvin and Hobbes that were enlightening, heartening and beautiful.  He is a true American genius that I hope will be appreciated for generations to come.  I know when I, hopefully some day, have kids, Calvin and Hobbes will definitely be a part of their life.

0385534639|4.0|I put  down Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to read The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern right away.  Having both books in the forefront of my mind, the only comparison I can draw is they are  both written in third person, and there's magic.  Oh, and a train.  So if you think you're getting a dose of dueling wizards battling it out to the death in the name of good against evil with bolts of electricity flaring from wands, you'll be sorely disappointed.  The press is drawing the comparison for publicity and money.  Let's all just admit that there will never be another Harry Potter, and move on to embrace the new.<br /><br />That's you, publishers and media!<br /><br />Erin Morgentstern's The Night Circus is not the traditional circus you know.  It's a beautifully imagined, intricately detailed, magical place that enchants all who enter.  The circus is as much a character in the story--if not more so--than all the other characters combined.  I never use to understand people saying they wished they could live in a certain favorite fictional world.  Until now.  I would SO run away with this circus, easily donning black with a splash of scarlet to become a reveur, giving up my predictable life to follow the Night Circus to all its exotic and romantic locales: Constantinople, London, Munich, Sydney, Paris, to name a few.  Morgenstern was sure to involve all the senses when describing the circus. It's such a disappointment that it isn't real.<br /><br />Two rival magicians--Prospero the Enchanter and a man known only as Mr A. H-- decide to throw down and have a contest to see who can produce the better student of magic.  Chosen as children, Celia and Marco are kept separated, training their whole lives for the competition, but the rules are never explained.<br /><br />One sorta major detail left out in their education is only one can survive.  (The Night Circus is as similar to The Hunger Games as fried chicken is to beignets. Just saying.)  The circus venue is announced and the competition begins, although no one knows anything about it save student and mentor.<br /><br />There are cloud mazes in the air, a wishing tree, forests of sonnets.  Practically everything is controlled by magic, but the beauty of it is it's real magic disguised to look believable.  A person's grip on reality can be a fragile thing; it's best to leave others alone in their safe perceptions.  Years pass as Celia and Marco keep adding more and more magical entertainment, learning to respect each other long before they meet.  Once they do meet, their romance is slow to grow as both are aware it would complicate things if they collaborated on projects.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Morgenstern occasionally used the very rare second person POV, putting readers directly into the story, experiencing the circus for themselves:<br /><br />\\"You feel the warmth of breath on your neck, but when you turn no one is there.\\"<br /><br />Harry Potter feels like a wild, epic adventure whereas, to me, The Night Circus and its cast of characters is a controlled execution, proper and refined, just like the Victorians are often portrayed, and this absolutely fits the story.<br /><br />\\"The silence that falls between them is a comfortable one.  He longs to reach over and touch her, but he resists, fearful of destroying the delicate camaraderie they are building.\\"<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern has a wild imagination, and I love her attention to detail.  An example of her creativity:<br /><br />  \\"This woman's skin is shimmering and pale, her long black hair is tied with dozens of silver ribbons that fall over her shoulders.  Her gown is white, covered in what to Bailey looks like looping black embroidery, but as he walks closer he sees that the black marks are actually words written across the fabric.  When he is near enough to read parts of the gown, he realizes that they are love letters, inscribed in handwritten text.  Words of desire and longing wrapping around her waist, flowing down the train of her gown as it spills over the platform.<br />  The statue herself is still, but her hand is held out, and only then does Bailey notice the young woman with a red scarf standing in front of her, offering the love letter-clad statue a single crimson rose.<br />  The movement is so subtle that it is almost undetectable, but slowly, very, very slowly, the statue reaches to accept the rose.  Her fingers open, and the young woman with the rose waits patiently as the statue gradually closes her hand around the stem, releasing it only when it is secure.<br />  And then the young woman bows to the statue, and walks off into the crowd.\\"<br /><br />Although I enjoyed Celia and Marco, my favorite character was Bailey (besides the circus itself).  He was the only one that had any real palpable tension.  I kept waiting for something to happen between Celia and Marco, but even they confess that the circus competition feels like an exhibition.  Curious things happen, but rather than being hooked, I was merely nibbling at the bait.  It is not until more than halfway through the book that Celia and Marco realize the consequences of losing, and this ratchets up the emotion, the tension, the suspense.  The reader becomes invested.<br /><br />Having said that,  Erin Morgenstern has still written an exquisite novel that will be treasured as creative genius.  Imagining her actually making tiny models of the circus and other things--she's an artist after all--only contributes to the magic.<br /><br />This from USA Today:<br /><br />\\"With a first printing of 150,000 copies, and rights sold in 30 countries, expectations are high for this first-time novel. Morgenstern says she didn't plan the book as a series, but enough questions dangle at the end to set the stage for a sequel.\\"<br /><br />Through a short tweet session with Erin Morgenstern, she said she's not sure what they mean by \\"dangling questions\\" and said perhaps publishers are interested in tangential tales.<br /><br />This book is lovely as a stand alone.  I'm not doubting that Morgenstern can pull off lavish tangential tales, but this book resonates as it is, and sometimes it's best just to say, \\"That was a damn good story.\\"<br /><br />\\"He sits back in his chair and steadily returns the stare aimed at him.  Taking his time as though he has all of it in the world, in the universe, from the days when tales meant more than they do now, but perhaps less than they will someday, he draws a breath that releases the tangled knot of words in his heart, and they fall from his lips effortlessly.<br />  \\"The circus arrives without warning.\\"s held out, and only then does Bailey notice the young woman with a red scarf standing in front of her, offering the love letter-clad statue a single crimson rose.

B00596WEVI|3.0|In a quote on the back of the DVD case, Black Belt Magazine names this \\"the best Jean-Claude Van Damme movie and the best Scott Adkins movie. Ever.\\" Now, I put a lot of stock in that publication, but I really can't imagine where the writer's priorities were on the day he reviewed this movie. \\"Assassination Games\\" is a good DTV thriller but a thoroughly disappointing martial arts action film - a definite step down from Van Damme's previous [[ASIN:B002U6CJCO Universal Soldier: Regeneration]] and Adkins' jaw-dropping [[ASIN:B003FXXNH6 Undisputed III: Redemption]]. Were it not for the movie's adherence to style and sound production values, I'd say for certain that it's disappointing enough to break Van Damme's recent revivalist streak.<br /><br />The story: two ace assassins - one calloused by the cutthroat lifestyle but still going strong (Van Damme), one left vengeful but vulnerable after his occupation took its toll on his family (Adkins) - must form a shaky alliance to take down a vicious crime lord (Ivan Kaye, [[ASIN:B000GUK1XU The Green Green Grass]]), unaware that they're playing into a deadly set-up by crooked cops.<br /><br />I must admit, the movie has many good things going for it. \\"Assassination Games\\" succeeds as one of the few movies made in Romania to actually look good: the cinematography and art direction are sound, bereft of the usual grey bleakness lesser films capture in the same setting. The writing is superior for a DTV flick: were I judging this as an intrigue thriller, I'd give it a higher score, and unlike in a lot of low-budget flicks, many interesting things that are referenced early in the movie end up making a meaningful comeback later down the road (e.g. the smart gun, the Van Damme character's relationship to the church). The acting is surprisingly good: Van Damme continues to channel the dark energy he first expressed in [[ASIN:B001PWY4NG JCVD]] and Scott proves that he doesn't need to be doing a Russian accent to appear intense - both of them proving themselves to be capable dramatic players in a time when a lot of viewers are expecting this. Stylistically and dramatically, this film succeeds.<br /><br />Then you remember that you're actually supposed to be watching an action movie, and at once it seems barren. Of the entire 101-minute running time, I counted barely 7 minutes given over to actual adrenaline-pumping scenes. Of these, there are only two real fights among a meager smattering five-second beat-'em-ups, and only one of them is actually worth noting. The Van Damme/Adkins rematch makes no improvement over their earlier scuffle in [[ASIN:B0011VIO46 The Shepherd: Border Patrol]]. Scott has a few cool moves throughout the movie, including a painful-looking flying dropkick, but none of these come up in his over-edited brawl with Jean-Claude which once again does not take advantage of the capacities of its performers. I do believe that director Ernie Barbarash ([[ASIN:B0006Z2LH4 Cube Zero]]) was aware of the significance of having these two starring in the same movie, but it seems as though he was too caught up in trying to make the film seem legitimate to capitalize on the actual action aspect of his action movie.<br /><br />I think there are enough fans out there of both of the main stars who'll like this one enough to keep it from being a pitfall in either of their careers, but I declare myself let down. My cinematic opus of Van Damme/Adkins martial artistry is apparently never to be, leaving me more than a bit disheartened.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Anthrax so to say I have been anticipating something new from them for awhile would be obvious. What I wasn't expecting was one of the best metal records I have heard in quite some time and what could be Anthrax's best offering to date. I will admit I was a bigger fan of John Bush on vocals; that is until now. Joey delivers the best vocals I have heard from him ever. Maybe it was because this time out he had more freedom to do what he wanted. Maybe because he feels he has nothing to lose, or more appropriately, everything to gain from giving his best performance ever. Let's face it, with Anthrax your job is never really secure behind the mic.     The songs run the gamut of metal and never get boring. Not one bad track on this one. From an all out assault to something more cerebral they have it.     Album of the year? Don't doubt it.

I wish there were more books out there like this!
B005KAH7QU|5.0|At times a bit slow, but inovative and extremely artistic. If you're interested in a run of the mill \\"action thriller\\" you might want to pass this one up.   This is cutting edge stuff......I enjoyed every second, from the creative camera work to a soundtrack which will blow your mind. There are a few weakneses for sure, but in general this film shines.    Most of the negative reveiws seem to have a problem with new and inovative movie making....maybe in a few years they will come around!  Not for close minded audiences....
0688172377|4.0|Her beauty and her stated sense of love for grace, peace, joy, and dignity seem to conflict with how she expresses herself.   Boy, does she have a mouth on her and the way she expresses herself seems to belie a beguiling outward appearance!!  I mean did she use the F and the S words so robustly in her native Somali language?  One wonders!    To be sure her telling of family life in Somalia, her flight to avoid an unwanted marriage, her trials and tribulations while trying to avoid death and destruction are poignant, admirable accounts that made one cringe learning of the intimate horrors of female genital mutilation.  Her innocence, puzzlement, and eventual mingling  into a fast-paced, high tech society had me laughing and cheering her brave attempts to acclimate to whatever good and bad things came her way.  Her modeling career success is amazing, but, then she is a stunning looking woman.     As an aside,  I realized once I finished reading \\"Desert Flower\\" and seeing some of the photos of Waris that I may have used one of her modeling shots to create an oil painting I did many years ago.  Until I read her book, I had never heard of her.  Anyway,  I was very taken with a woman in a photo I found in a magazine. I named the piece \\"Woman of Zanzibar\\" though there was no reference in the photo as to where the woman's photo was taken.   I guess I wasn't too far off the beaten track as Zanzibar is just south of Somalia on the east coast of Africa.  The title just seemed so right!     I have to agree with other reviewers that approximately the last half of \\"Desert Flower\\" seems to be much less rich in narrative and becomes seemingly shallow  and often hurtful to those around her with screaming tirades  like \\"I'll kill you!\\", \\"I hate you\\" and other strident confrontations.  I guess you could say she is just picking up on a \\"western\\" persona and has left behind a sense of serenity and calm she experienced growing up.  But that in itself is a contradiction.   She clearly negates her culture's embrace of female genital mutilation a practice she attributes to \\"the ego, selfishness, and aggression of men\\"!        She scolds westerners for being artificial, lacking family values, rushing around trying to get more money and things, being obsessed with weight loss and perceives western society to be unappreciative of its many wonderful freedoms and wealth.  I do think that is true of many Americans but I don't think is by any means the majority.  She does say, however, \\"I am grateful that I've experienced both lives.\\"  I know she means well by the comparison of the two cultures she's been a part of, but some of her remarks do seem a little condescending.  That is since we \\"westerners\\" haven't experienced the horrors and struggles she has endured, we are somewhat lacking an understanding of what is profoundly precious in life.  But, bless her heart, anyway!  I hope in her further writings she'll clean up her words and speak with more dignity and less raucous discourse.

0307887898|5.0|Eric's book is not only a terrific primer for entrepreneurs and business types -- it also contains tools and strategies that could be of tremendous value for creative types (writers, painters, musicians, filmmakers, etc.). In particular, key concepts such as rapid iteration, continuous deployment, and pivoting could help creatives reframe many of the challenges they face, provide them with alternative strategies, and enable them to be more effective in their chosen field AND in the marketplace. Bravo Eric!
B004GXZ69W|4.0|This review is from: Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 Small - Mouse - laser - 6 button(s) - wired - USB (Personal Computers)  I bought this mouse, hoping to relieve wrist and finger pain. I like it but did not realize that it would be better suited for someone who works at a desk. I use a laptop and move from place to place. Sometimes my surface is just a lapdesk or a t.v. tray or something else not as sturdy as a desk. This mouse works best if you have a larger surface at elbow height where you can rest your forearm.     It took a little bit of getting used to. At first I kept pressing down with my thumb to hold it in place. But I have since learned to relax my hand. It has relieved my wrist pain tremendously, but has done nothing to keep my ring finger from locking up.     Also, I am so used to wireless devices that the wire attachment gets in the way sometimes. Overall, I like it and will keep using it.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|Belladonna or Bush?  Frankly, I like them both.  Fan since Fistful of Metal (I know that was Turbin singing), I loved STD, ATL blew me away, even liked \\"I'm the Man\\".  They lost me with State of Euphoria and I never got into Persistence of Time.  Then Joey is out, Bush is in and I loved SOWN. Stomp 442 never got into.  Loved the Threat is Real and WCFYA.  Yes, I was a Bush fan, mainly because I was a big Armored Saint fan. But, through all the crap over the last few years, the wait is worth it and Belladonna delivers by all accounts.  If Anthrax hung things up after this release they'd still have one of the most impressive catalogs of thrash/metal music out there between Belladonna and Bush.  And as far as the last releases from the Big 4, Worship Music is by far the best.  Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" seems to have wasted Rob's talents - why is he playing the same parts as the the guitar?  Some awesome jams but the songs are forgettable.  Megadeth's 'End Game' shines in spots but is too much of the samething, where is the dynamics in the songs that make Killing, Peace, Youth, Rust so freakin' good?  Great thrash gutiar but none of the songs are memorable.  Slayer's \\"World Painted Blood\\", well, Slayer is Slayer and I like them for that but I have never been able to listen to a Slayer album in its entireity in one sitting and I own their entire catalog.  Worship Music delivers on all acocunts and Belladonna sounds awesome.  Great job guys, hope it isn't another 8 years and three singers later before the next release.
B0052WSX32|5.0|To millions of people, Doris Day is best known as the enormously popular star of dozens of hit movie musicals and comedies in the 1950's and 60's. She later starred on a hit CBS television series that ran into the 1970's by which time she began devoting more and more of her time to animal welfare. With few exceptions, she has remained out of the limelight since her move to picturesque Carmel by the Sea some thirty years ago.<br /><br />Doris Day's tremendous movie stardom overshadowed, in many ways, her equally successful career as a recording artist. Beginning in the mid-1940's, for more than twenty years she was one of the biggest recording artists at Columbia, earning enough Gold Records to panel several walls. Two of her song hits won Academy Awards as Best Song and another 4 were nominated for the honor.<br /><br />Her theme song - Whatever Will Be, Will Be\\" (Que Sera Sera) is fixed in the minds of many as the only song Miss Day is known for.  In reality, she recorded nearly 700 songs and some of her concept albums from the 50's and 60's are among the best recordings ever made. Her duet album from the early 60's with Andre Previn is a classic of its type. \\"Latin for Lovers\\" is an exhilarating mix of sensuality and Latin-type music that is intoxicating and Day's take on \\"Let it Snow\\" from her 1960's Christmas album is the sexiest version of this song ever recorded.<br /><br />Day's vocal skills are flawless.

B005974CNA|5.0|Dream Theater fans tend to be an obsessive bunch, almost invariably skilled and knowledgeable musicians themselves. As I sit here writing this on the morning of the CD's release in the UK, there are debates raging on various forums about Dream Theater's latest album. Some are analysing the music like it's a crime scene, dusting through every bar looking for odd time signatures and evidence of earlier influences. Others are obsessing over the mixing and mastering. And yet another group is combing through the lyrics (particularly those by John Myung) looking for clues to the secret of life. I'm going to take a radical angle here and discuss the music itself, and how it affects me. I'm not saying those other issues don't matter. Clearly they do, or else so many people wouldn't write so passionately about them. But I'm not a gifted musician, I know nothing about the techniques of recording and mastering music, and if I want great words, I tend not to look to rock stars for them. Why I fell in love with Dream Theater back in 2001 was the exceptional musicianship and gorgeous textures of their music. So this is how I'll try to appraise this latest album.     Firstly, as we all know, Portnoy left in September 2010. What affect has this had? Well, immediately, only Labrie sings. There are no more growls and toe-curling death-metal rapping, for lack of a more apt description of that abomination that marred A Nightmare To Remember. And Labrie sings brilliantly. Nowhere on this record does he sneer or snarl or bark or shriek his way through passages, as he occasionally did on the previous 2 or 3 releases. He merely sings, and his voice has colour and charm and beauty and power. It is becoming a cliché on those forums I mentioned, but it is nonetheless true: this is the James Labrie of Images and Words and Awake. It is among his best work.     His contribution to the song-writing is also evident. Build me Up, Break Me Down sounds like something that would have fit nicely ontoone of his solo albums, and has a wonderful chorus. Not my favourite track on the album, but a good, solid piece. Lost Not Forgotten works for me on many levels (Petrucci's guitar solo is wonderful. Echoes of Under A Glass Moon, but this could never be a bad thing). The opening contains an over-the-top segment of (it seems to me) completely aimless widdling, but it doesn't last too long.     The real surprise on this album was the 3 ballads. With a few notable exceptions (Anna Lee, Hollow Years, Disappear) I've never really taken to DT ballads. Too sickly, too banal. The appeal of Dream Theatre is usually the formidable musicianship and wholly unique arrangements of their pieces. Water them down to a 3rd-rate Coldplay and what's the point? But on this album, the ballads (I'll repeat, 3 of them!) are a) well placed on the CD, and b) beautiful. This Is The Life has a soaring guitar solo (2 of them in fact), and tasteful playing from Rudess. Far From heaven ddn't do it for me at first, but after many listens, is now one of my favourite DT tracks. It's a short one, but...such a beautiful, gorgeous vocal line from Labrie. And finally, what may be the most purely sublime piece DT have ever written, the album's closing track: Beneath The Surface. I like to think I hold myself together quite well, I'm not an overly-emotional person, and very few things move me to tears - but this track did, the first time I heard it. And with each repeated listen, it somehow becomes more and more beautiful. One of those tracks (for me at least) which, once it's sunk in to your soul, it's hard to imagine a time before it was a part of your life.     The other tracks on the album are very strong. Bridges In The Sky begins oddly, with a noise that any lover of a spicy mutton vindaloo will find familiar (first time I heard that guttural growl I was afraid Portnoy was guesting on vocals), but turns into quite an epic song, with a soaring melody and - lord be praised - a tasteful instrumental section which fits with the song, as opposed to a collection of impossibly difficult technical exercises. Some chap on the Dream Theater website's forum is currently engaged in a forensic examination of this song, claiming that its structure exactly mirrors that of Metropolis. Maybe so, maybe so. I personally couldn't care less about that degree of analysis. To me, it's just a great song, and to my ears sounds nothing like Metropolis. Besides which, I'd much prefer Dream Theater draw on their own catalogue for inspiration rather than any other band's, which is what I feel they were sometimes doing with Octavarium, Systematic Chaos, and Black Clouds. After all, nobody ever did it better than they themselves did.     Outcry is an album highlight, a great balance of technique and beauty. Breaking All Illusions is the album's masterpiece, with one of the most beautiful and spine-chilling endings I've ever heard in a song. I know the album is still fresh and it's tempting to be hyperbolic before it's really had a chance to sink in fully, but nonetheless, if I were stranded on an island I honestly think I could be happy with only this track for company. Dream Theater have often written exceptionally beautiful endings to otherwise mediocre tracks (Octavarium, Best of Times), but here, the entire track is one flawless gem.     So, in conclusion...I loved Mike Portnoy (still do). I think his drumming on In The Name Of God was a masterpiece of technique counterpoised against emotion. He was that rarest of entities - a truly musical drummer. But I didn't like the direction DT was taking with recent albums, and I feel that he was the reason for that change. Too much death metal growling. Too much musical masturbation, too little music. Sometimes it was just plain silly, and other times, embarrassingly derivative (watch the Systematic Chaos `Making Of' DVD and count the number of times Portnoy says things like: \\"Wow, this is great, we sound like Biohazard here!\\" Or \\"This is our cool Meshuggah section\\". Just be freakin' DT please!). This album is the sound of a group of preternaturally talented musicians playing as a tight unit. The songs are well constructed and brilliantly executed. They are original and inspiring, sometimes sending chills down the spine. There are moments which are supremely beautiful, but never childish and mawkish as seen on previous albums (\\"The Answer Lies Within\\" - is that right? There was I thinking an unexamined life was the way forward). This is not an easy record, it takes time to even begin to get a grasp of all that is going on here. Hence, it is classic Dream Theater. God forgive me but I'm happy Portnoy left if this is the result. This is what made the group wholly unique, and this record - while drawing on their past - is entirely new and fresh.     Album highlights, in order:     Breaking All Illusions   Beneath The Surface   Outcry   This Is The Life     My whole-hearted recommendation is to buy this album. And thank you Dream Theater, on the off-chance you're reading this. The music you create makes my life so much better.
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|Great story set in the city of love! Perkins rights a great romance set in Paris.  St. Clair is not perfect, he is cute, but short and dealing with family problems.

0439023521|5.0|I love this series!  I was instantly hooked and was so bummed after finishing the last book in the series because it was over and there were no more to read. :(  Good news is the movie is coming out in 2012, bad news is the movie is never as good as the book.  I have read articles that compared this series to Twighlit as being the next big thing.  While I admit that I like Twighligt, I like this series much more. It has much more depth to the story.  There is the romance and love triangle that we all love, but there is also the story about the state of their society and what they are forced to do that adds a whole new element to the story.  The characters are a bit more mature and the teens aren't dealing with trivial things like teen angst or prom, etc.  At times this book brought me to tears at how tragic it was, but other parts gave me butterflies and hope as a love story often does.  Great book!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I love Star Wars.  I like the Special Editions.  I like the DVD releases.  I enjoy the prequels.  Greedo shooting first does not bother me.  Adding cgi stuff to the original trilogy is fine.  Hayden showing up as a force ghost is cool.    I have three copies on the original trilogy.  The original vhs releases, the special edition releases, and the DVD box set.  I also own the DVDs of the prequel trilogy.  These movies are great and I have seen them all dozens of times.  My home theater is begging for an HD version of these movies so my kids and I can enjoy them in the best possible manner.    These are not the blu rays I'm looking for.    If it was Lucas who decided to add Vader's \\"no, nooooo!\\" into the climactic scene of Return of the Jedi, he has officially lost it.  It ruins the scene.  First of all, it does not sound like it was edited by a professional (in the UK version at least, that is the only one I've actually seen it on).  Second, it does not sound like James Earl Jones.  Third, why?  Just why?  That scene was perfect.  The music and movement showed Vader's turmoil and ultimate decision with absolute perfection.  This edit is a deal breaker for me.  Lucas will make money hand over fist on this but it has the unique characteristic of being the first version released in thirty years that I will not be purchasing.
159102594X|3.0|and I know this is weird, but I didn't like the names of the characters.  They didn't give me a feel for times or location, and the word 'comrades' and the name 'Glokta' almost made me wonder if this was some strange Russian fantasy.  It was a turn-off for me.  I stuck with it, waiting for the magical stuff.  It turned out to be an engaging-enough read that I'll begin book II.  Though not what I expected, and probably read too soon after completing the R.R. Martin series, the series is worth your time, considering what's out there.

030788743X|3.0|I feel like I'm dumping a turd in the punch bowl by only giving this book three stars, but here's the deal:  it's a one-time read, and then you give it away to anybody who might remember the 1980's.    It's got all the movie references, all the music, all the video games, good guys, bad guys, puzzles, easter eggs, transformers, Godzilla, and Steve Wozniak (or someone like him), but in the end I found myself saying \\"meh.\\"  As soon as I finished the book, I gave it away to a random passer-by (ok, one of the cute waitresses at \\"Apres Diem\\") who claimed some knowledge/memory of the 1980's.    For the author, the worst thing is he left himself no room for a sequel.  I mean, I'd have written it so the bad guys won (sorry for giving a way a plot point, but the bad guys never win, do they?), if only to sell \\"Ready Player Two\\".    The book was ok, but I wouldn't be bothered to read it again.
0385534639|3.0|Most reviewers have compared THE NIGHT CIRCUS to the Harry Potter or Twilight saga books. For this reader, it is a duel to the death tale of baffling revenge that more closely resembles Christopher Priest's THE PRESTIGE or Ray Bradbury's SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES. All three books are allegories, a battle of wills that take the reader on a journey of imagination and fantasy. One common thread shared by Night Circus and The Prestige is their presentation as non-linear narratives. I found Morgenstern choice of the third person present tense in which to relate her story rather off putting and annoying after a couple hundred pages while, for this reader at least, Priest's epistolary style lent greater realism to his tale of dueling magicians.<br /><br />The Marco/Celia love story aspect of this offering, while dressed up in beautiful visuals, is mundanely predictable. Their magic too poses the question of whether the particular brand of magic being practiced by the duo is an inborn talent or just a series of parlor tricks that can be taught like arithmetic.<br /><br />When Chandresh Christophe Lef&egrave;vre, a theatrical producer enamored of lavish spectacles describes his vision of the circus he says \\"this will be an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses, an immersive entertainment\\", he could well have been describing Ms. Morgenstern's book.<br /><br />As any reader of my review can tell, I definitely have mixed emotions about this book. I was galvanized by the pictorial writing but at the same time experienced an aversion to the predictability of certain story plot points and the manner in which the story was related.....the exasperating third person narrative.<br /><br />I give 5 stars to the eloquent and sumptuous writing and 2 stars to the provocative manner of delivery and an ending that was underwhelming. 3 ½ stars total.
0553801503|4.0|A Feast for Crows continues the incredible \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  It's this simple - if you're reading the series, you're gonna really like (or even love) this 4th installment; if you're not reading the series (yet), you need to start at the 1st book - A Game of Thrones - and read them all in order (you'll be totally lost if you try to \\"jump in\\" somewhere in the middle of this epic.  In my opinion, this is the greatest fantasy series out there (I admit I haven't read 'em all, but it's true of all the series I'VE ever read) - and yes, G.R.R. Martin IS 'the American Tolkien'... or maybe he even goes The Master one better.  Enjoy!

This is a very real story that has taken place and to be able to see it full on means a lot to me because I know FULLY understand the truth behind his ultimate sacrifice, which will no longer be taken lightly. I THANK GOD HE SENT HIS ONLY SON to save me.. PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM AND LET IT TOUCH YOUR HEART. A MUST WATCH !!! GOD BLESS YOU ALL ! :)
B004J4XGN6|4.0|The Lean Startup takes many of the (unwritten) lessons about startups and innovation from Silicon Valley and packages them for a more mainstream audience. It makes a very strong case for testing business assumptions and experimentation, and looking at innovation as  a managerial practice. A particularly valuable concept is the idea of defining a value engine (what customers want) and a growth engine (how to make it reach the entire market).    Discussions about the market and business model are missing for the most part (but [[ASIN:0976470705 The Four Steps to the Epiphany]], [[ASIN:0470876417 Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers]] and [[ASIN:0983723605 Nail It then Scale It: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Creating and Managing Breakthrough Innovation]] are excellent complements and the book would have been too long otherwise), and it can be either too conceptual or too tactical at times. Still, The Lean Startup makes an excellent job at evangelizing the idea (and need) of testing assumptions before scaling and committing additional resources to a new business.

Collins has an amazing gift to keep the story moving at a good pace and the reader completely engaged.<br /><br />I was worried that it wouldn't be able to live up to the level of the first book but it definitely did.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've tried 4 different cases for my iPhone 4 and this one offers by far the best combination of style, protection, price and fit of any of them.  Nice clear design lets you see the beauty of the phone and the plastic fits snug and protects the phone from drops and scratches.  Good job, Amazon.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There was something about this book which didn't grab me as wholeheartedly as the others in the series. I think that Collins introduces too many characters to follow thus making it harder to keep an emotional bond with each. There were times when I had to search earlier parts to make sure I wasn't confusing any of them.  On top of that, while I felt like the other two books had plot twists which I didn't see coming, there weren't any in this which I felt had the same impact.    Outside of that, it retained her typical style of blending action against Katniss' emotional journey - which still worked well.     Honestly, if this was an individual story I would've probably given this book 4 stars but I feel it's more than just a small step down from the previous two.  It was a good ending to The Hunger Games saga, even if the end wrapped up a little too nicely for my taste.
0307887898|5.0|The Lean Startup serves as a good template for your own startup or project wherever you are at.  It serves as a good reference for software companies today.  With the emergence of open source frameworks and cloud computing, the cost for launching a business is cheaper than ever.  Testing out your ideas in the marketplace in the simplest ways possible is a great paradigm to follow.  I have used a combination of Eric's outline and other principles such as Peter Sim's Little Bets, and have launched a successful startup called IGN Pro League within IGN Entertainment in less than a year.  I have found that building the minimal viable product, build in the monetization vehicle on day 1 and test it in the marketplace is the best way to test any idea you have.  What I have launched with 5 volunteers at IGN competes well with other companies who have raised millions of dollars in the past.      The book is a fast read.  The principles outlined will save you a bunch of time and resources to get something launched.  I agree with other readers that this book may serve big companies better (using my own experience as an example,) but doesn't that allocate the resources better in our economy as a whole as Mr. Ries has claimed?
0316017930|4.0|Gladwell succeeds by taking the tack of questioning widely held assumptions and beliefs around success and looking for other factors which contribute to success.  Even though the explanations surrounding environment can cause us to pause, especially when the environmental factors can relate back to ethnic and socio-economic factors, they do create a thought-provoking vision.    I thought the last chapter was gratuitous and self-indulgent and detracted from the rest of the book.

0307278255|5.0|As a lover of short stories and a fan of Lahiri's other works, I was not disappointed by her latest collection. Her way with words is detailed without becoming boring or superfluous, and her insight into her characters' hearts and minds leaves you wanting so much more. My only suggestion is that if you're a softy like me, you should find yourself something more upbeat to read after this selection. Like many beautiful works of fiction about love and family, this book might leave you a little heavy-hearted. Other than that, it's a beautiful addition to any bookshelf.

It is not however, 100% comprehensive on certain subjects, which is why I didn't give it five stars. For example, in the chapter discussing startup and shutdown, it goes into a discussion of rc.d symbolic links to init.d services and it talks about the S## and K## prefixes, which it covers well; but it fails to go in-depth about runlevels and which ones are used on each platform for reboot, startup, shutdown, etc. Still the book is pretty darn good. If it were possible, I would accurately give it 4.5 stars.

0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries has done it - codifying the key elements of an iterative process for entrepreneurial success.    Who should read this book?    Lean Startup Practitioners - Though you may already be familiar with Eric and LS (as I was), the book pulls together existing threads in an effective and valuable format and ties in with real-world examples.    Entrepreneurs - If you're not familiar with Lean Startup and currently manage a startup (or are thinking of founding a company), this book offers tools that could literally spell the difference between success and failure.    Intrapreneurs - If you incubate or innovate within a large organization the Lean Startup principles can be applied to your situation with meritorious effect.    The Lean Startup methodology is designed to help startups succeed and minimize risks of failure. Eric Ries leads readers through a process focused on validated learning from the marketplace (about your product/offering feature sets) utlizing a Build=>Measure=>Learn iterative loop that is coupled with 'innovation accounting' - approaches designed to effectively measure progress, define milestones and prioritize efforts.    The Lean Startup is equal parts 'theory' and practice - liberally sprinkled with examples and 'case study' elements throughout. It is an extremely approachable work - far removed from the esoteric, academic style too often used in presenting these types of prescriptive works.     If you are involved in entrepreneurship or innovation in any fashion, this is a key resource to have in your toolbox!

B005974CDU|4.0|A Dramatic Turn of Events is finally here, playing through my monitors and giving all of us DT fans a -lot- to think about. In that sense, it marks a dramatic change for me, as the last couple of albums didn't challenge me like this does. In a way, similarly to when Octavarium released so many years ago, ADToE challenges us as listeners to dig in deep and rediscover where DT is today. As before, it includes a lot of where they've come from, as well as painting some pictures of what they have gone through the past several months. But more so I think it points to where DT may be headed in their post-MP years. As some of the other (excellent, by the way) reviews pointed out, they've left behind the heaviness that had been getting woven into the last two albums. And that isn't to say I didn't like them, they had some great things in their own right (Constant Motion remains in my top ten favorite DT tracks). This album is by far Jame's best to date, his vocal performance is stunning throughout. I think that Jordan also has such a major role in this album as well (certainly compared to BC&SL).    Of course Mangini delivers, no one doubted that. But I didn't feel like we were hearing enough of his own voice, musically speaking. His vocabulary is different than Mike Portnoy's, it is easy to try to think of them as drummers of a similar vein but actually they approach things very differently. Mangini is more organic than MP, and has a substantially different feel between his feet and left hand. Here it is obvious that he had to play on top of the existing arrangements, so the next album will be truly revealing in terms of his contribution to the band. I have little question that it is going to be more of the big, bold compositions we see here that have more progressive feeling underpinnings. Also, I think JM and Mangini work very well together, there is definitely something different evolving in the rhythm section and, again, I think we'll really see that come to surface inthe next album.    Looking back to -this- album though, I do have to comment on the technical bits. First off, the drums are simply too far back into the mix, and I remain unconvinced of how they were treated in terms of eq and dynamics. Speaking of dynamics, I feel the entire album lacks them, and this is most likely due to post production and mastering decisions. It has obviously been maximized to some degree and it really does a disservice to the excellent material within. This alone will keep it from ever being another Scenes from a Memory. Whether it is the mix, the playing, or both, some of the more technical runs in this album (such as in Build Me Up, Break Me Down) get a bit fatiguing.    Overall though I can say without question that this release has exceeded all expectations. I really wasn't sure what would be here for us to discover, and it turns out to be a lot. Definitely will get a lot of listens and I will have to try to see the new lineup on tour as well. Well done!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|In 1988, George Lucas stood before Congress and issued the following statement:    \\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.    I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.    The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.    A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.    People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.    These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.    I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.    I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.    The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.    There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houstonhave been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The Maltese Falcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.\\"

B0050CJNJ2|3.0|This is a bit of a let down for me- I'm a big fan of Lady A's quick tempo happy songs- \\"our kind of Love\\", \\"perfect day\\", \\"stars tonight\\", \\"something 'bout a woman\\" from their \\"need you now\\" album. There are really only 2-3 that would fall into this category on this disc and these on a whole just don't do it for me like their previous efforts. Also, the group always has some but there are a disproportionate number of slower songs and/or those tackling the subject of lost or failing relationships, which I just don't enjoy listening to at all. Even the relatively upbeat and cheerful title track, included in my \\"2-3\\" above is remembering a relationship that is gone. As a whole I find the disc much less catchy than both previous efforts.  \\"Friday night\\" is probably my favorite.  If I were to compile my own Lady A CD I'd take 4-5 of the tracks and leave the rest, and pair those with 7-8 from each of the last two albums.       Of course, if you are the type who enjoys listening or relating to the type of songs I don't, maybe you will love this album.    Maybe time will prove me wrong but I just don't see this as having the success as Need You Now.  That said, it is still worth the amazon price @ launch.
B005974CNA|3.0|DT Is back with their 11th album and one that is infamously without Mike Portnoy.  This \\"Dramatic Turn of Event\\" caused quite a stir and a lot of longtime fans had concern for the future of the band.  But DT is as resilient a band as they come and in the offseason picked-up a new drummer (as seen on YouTube) in Mike Mangini, wrote and recorded their album, and proceeded to work a quite successful European tour circuit.    As for A Dramatic Turn of Events (ADTOE, the hype for this album has been tremendous among fans.  What would DTs writing look like without Portnoy who was a major influence in the direction of the band, specifically over the last few years.  Well, to be honest the writing does not look that much different.  There is still very much the modern metal element, crazy technical acrobatics in the instrumental sections, and a lot of overly thematic passages.  What is unique is that DT came up with a sort of gimmick for this album that some people are starting to catch on to which is, they took old song charts from I&W songs and put new music to them to create a few songs on this album.  If you follow the structure of songs you can see how they match up.  For instance On the Backs of Angels = Pull Me under, Lost Not Forgotten = Under a Glass Moon, and Outcry = Metropolis.  This is an interesting idea and one that is not so apparent on the surface because the music is different.  But it works and gives ADTOE events a more progressive feel that resembles early DT.    Now for the actual music.  I think this disc is a bit fresher than their last few releases but still falls into some of the pitfalls of current DT.  What I do like is some of the vocal melodies and chord progressions are stunning and engaging, the mix is fresher and less fatiguing with the drums grooving more, and the disc has a varied selection of songs spanning from modern metal to piano driven ballad.  What I don't like as much is the overly technical aspect of a lot of the instrumental passages and the somewhat cliche guitar riffs.  In recent years JP and JR have injected a lot of technical playing where there used to be a lot more space and this album keeps that trend and even takes it up a notch.  At this point it starts to wash over me in a way that makes me lose interest in the songs.  But DT has also thrown in a lot of mellower songs in this album such as This is the Life and Beneath the Surface which are nice and offer the listener some relief.  For me Outcry is my favorite song and Bridges in the Sky offers some unique experiences as well.  Breaking all Illusions is probably the biggest nod to the past in the way the song feels with a nice jazzy JP solo.  Build Me Up, Break Me Down and Lost Not Forgotten are both just mediocre and typical DT.    3 Stars for a good effort and some unique and progressive aspects to this album.  It's not quite there for me in terms of their older catalog of music where their song writing skills went above and beyond and they left a lot more space in the music, but I think this album is a step in the right direction over their past 3-4 releases.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|\\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,\\" by Max Brooks (Crown Publishing, 2006), is the follow-up to his bestseller \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" (Three Rivers Press, 2003), but in \\"World War Z,\\" Brooks uses the zombie motif in a much more important way than is traditionally accomplished in other zombie fiction.<br /><br />He credits George Romero (director of \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" \\"Day of the Dead,\\" \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" et al) as an inspiration for his work. Yet Brooks, in my opinion, reaches further into this subgenre and creates a greater work of fiction by using the zombie to make an important statement about the human condition.<br /><br />The novel purports to be a record of interviews conducted by a journalist following an apocalyptic war with the zombies. These are the recorded memories of people who survived those times and what they experienced. Hundreds of millions of zombies were formed by hundreds of millions of other zombies attacking human beings anywhere and everywhere and causing the near-extermination of the human race. Countries were evacuated, governments collapsed and reformed, and a whole new way of waging war had to be learned.<br /><br />There are many individual stories in the book and many of them could be considered short stories by themselves, but taken together they remind one of \\"American Psycho\\" or the movie \\"Starship Troopers.\\" The stories are gory, exciting, and interesting, yet their real purpose is to provide a social commentary. Horror is the vehicle, but social change is the purpose.<br /><br />If \\"American Psycho\\" was all about the narcissism of the 1980's, and \\"Starship Troopers\\" was all about the propaganda that supports unnecessary wars, then \\"World War Z\\" is all about how we eat each other alive on a daily basis and think nothing of it. The theme of the novel is fictional zombies, but Brooks' zombies become a symbol for the dog-eat-dog mentality that is a very real and prevalent in our society today.<br /><br />Key to the symbol of the zombie is the fact that their brains must be destroyed in order to kill them. It's no wonder, really, because the zombie disease--the dog-eat-dog mentality--resides in the minds of people. And it proves to be a contagious mentality inasmuch as the more people treat each other badly, the more they want to treat each other badly.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book, Brooks' character, Jessica Hendricks, is a good example of the underlying occult motivations of a zombie mentality, and our reaction to her shows that the zombie virus is alive and well in all of us. In a thinly veiled reference to the existence of the radio personality, Howard Stern, she says:<br /><br />\\"He was doing his usual thing--fart jokes and insults and adolescent sexuality--and I remember thinking, \\"This man survived and my parents didn't.\\" No, I try not to be bitter.\\"<br /><br />Of course we can sympathize with her, but it's that very sympathy any of us would have that reveals the zombie contagion. For what she's really showing us is a thought process whereby it's perfectly okay to loathe another person simply because they exist. He should be dead and her mother should be alive--but this bitterness, in my opinion, ultimately becomes the zombie mentality, because justifiable as it may be, it is mindless and cruel in its implications. After all, those who love that radio show host wouldn't want to lose him either.<br /><br />One imagines Max Brooks might have found inspiration from The Cranberries in their 1994 song, \\"Zombie.\\" The lyrics thereof describe almost the exact mentality he describes in WWZ. Of course, instead of a fictional zombie war, Dolores O'riordan sings about the real decades long war between the British and Northern Ireland. In her song, and in his book, the bottom line is created: The human race is infected with the very contagious disease of inhumanity.<br /><br />One walks away from this novel understanding the seeds of ultimate apocalypse live withinthe brains of each and every one of us--and that must be eradicated at all costs. That kind of brain must be destroyed. Inhumanity is inherent to the mind of man, but ultimately human beings have the ability to change their minds. And when we pull away from the fictional aspect of this theme and moral, we realize that the best way to destroy a zombie brain is simply to change our own minds.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is a story rich in symbolism, irony, humor, horror, gore, excitement, and tragedy. It's a no-miss book for any lover of horror, and certainly any zombie aficionado. It pushes the boundaries of what even the godfather of zombies, George Romero, has established, and serves not only to entertain us but also to enlighten us. It's one of those books that put the \\"great\\" in great fiction.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" is soon to be a major motion picture by Plan B. Entertainment and comes out in 2012. It stars Brad Pit and is directed by Marc Forster. It will be quite something to see what they make of this story. I hope they retain its depth as well as its action and ghastly horror.osts.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|The brothers Scott are among the best moviemakers in the business; Ridley and Tony know how to tell a story via stunning visuals and heart-pounding action.  In UNSTOPPABLE Tony puts on the proverbial throttle from virtually the beginning of the film and doesn't even think about pulling it back; the result is nonstop mayhem, violence, and destruction that very much makes the film's $100 million budget not surprising.  Tony gets to tear up a lot of. . .stuff. . .in UNSTOPPABLE, a movie about a doofus who leaves his moving train to personally throw a switch--only the train gets away from him.  And speeds up; we're talking 70 mph speeds as it races through rural Pennsylvania on its way to a fictionalized metro (Stanton?), where certain derailment awaits--and of course the train is pulling several tankards of highly toxic chemicals.<br /><br />Yep.  That's why I took my heart pills as I was watching this puppy.<br /><br />While the railroad's execs dither on what to do another locomotive is in the area, operated by a crafty veteran engineer (Denzel Washington) and his wet-behind-the-ears conductor (Chris Pine).  When they're not snapping at one another Denzel's character is waxing philosophical while Pine's character is trying to smooth over a restraining order filed by his wife.  Ignoring the orders of the execs--who have decided to derail the train before it reaches the city--the rogue team pursues the train--in reverse--in an effort to connect to the runaway train's last car; then, they theorize, they'll put on the brakes to slow the runaway down.  Naturally, Scott really ratchets up the action here, and UNSTOPPABLE hurls like a rocket towards its climactic (yet sometimes cartoon-like) ending.  And Rosario Dawson looks darn good as a railroad operations supervisor, even though all she does is basically talk into a headset.  (Lucky headset.)  UNSTOPPABLE is an appropriate title, as it aptly identifies this film's thrills.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B000002J0N|4.0|I feel, like many others, that some of CSN's best work is on this one. But \\"Cathedral\\" and \\"I Give You Give Blind\\" really ruin the continuity and cohesiveness of the album.  There's a breezy 70's feel going on and then there's dragons and Winchester Cathedral and people dying in the name of Christ, and Nash high upon the altar and what not. Surrounded by the other songs here it comes off like a fart in church.   Then, just as the sublime \\"In My Dreams\\" ends in a whisper, \\"I Give You Give Blind\\" steps up and ruins the whole evening.  Again, the tunes are perhaps not terrible by themselves, but I feel they ruin the wonderful flow that could be.    The only other criticism I can give on the other end of the spectrum is that \\"Fair Game\\" and \\"Dark Star\\" are too similar in feel, and \\"Cold Rain\\" and \\"Carried Away\\" share the same feel and key.    Besides all this, this album contains some of the most beautiful stuff these guys ever wrote and sang in addition to being wonderfully recorded and engineered.
1401216676|5.0|The Killing Joke is a classic Batman tale telling an intriguing story about the Joker and the Gordon's.  It also includes the/an origin story for the Joker.  The writing in this tale is excellent and the art is very good and detailed.  I prefer more vibrant colors, but the art given works for the period it was produced in and for the tale it tells.    The back of the cover jacket notes that this is for mature readers and I would agree.  This would be fine for an 18+ reader, but is certainly not a book to buy for a young child.  The content is dark and in some cases graphic.  It is given this rating mostly for the violence (no foul language, but there is innuendo) and for the visual depictions (Commissioner Gordon's butt).  If these are not offensive to you I would highly recommend this book.    One thing to keep in mind is that this is relatively short for a graphic novel at only 46 pages for the original story (64 total counting the introduction, afterword, bonus story, and some sketches.)  Other Batman graphic novels are much longer so do not expect a lengthy book with The Killing Joke.  That being said, it is a very good deal as a hard cover for $9.99, which it was priced when I bought it, but may not be worth the list price of $17.99.    This book plays a major role with the relaunch of DC comics in the form of the New 52.  The new Batgirl series focuses on Barbara returning to her life as Batgirl after the events of this book.  If you have started reading that series and are confused or just want some more background on what happened to her, I strongly suggest you read this.      My only problem with this book was the ending, which I viewed as anticlimactic.  It was somewhat ambiguous, as admitted by the author in the afterword, and left me wondering what happened.  There are two types of people, the types who enjoy that sort of ending and the types who read a story to know the story and to know what happened.  I am that second type.  I read this to see what Batman did to the Joker, not to sit down afterwords and contemplate what Batman COULD have done.  But that's just me.    Overall it is a very good book which I would recommend to Batman or Joker fans, but not for young children.    ending

B005COO1X6|4.0|Stephen King has become a stronger, more mature, more self-aware writer over the years, and his themes have definitely shifted, but I still love the gore-splattered, b-movie fun of Night Shift and Skeleton Crew. Often pointless exercises in horror, with no redeeming message or even a happy ending, they were the stories that first made me a fan.<br /><br />Mile 81, could very well be a 'lost' story from those early collections. It's creepy and bizarre, with a monster that is never explained or justified, and an ending that's neither happy nor tidy. It's a story that gleefully wallows in its impossible gore, pushing one victim after another into harm's way, until you can't help but laugh (guiltily, of course) at the absurdity of it all.
0061743526|5.0|Far better than the movie - more complex, more sympathetic to some the movie had to gloss over.  Stands the time test, and reteaches us things that are worth remembering.  Not really about the South as too many would characterize it - more like about humans, the way we act, the points we miss, and the ways we could be so much better.

The book is sad, and disturbing in some areas, but yet the truth. If your a parent it will make you hold and hug on to your children just a little much tighter and aware of what is out there in this world we live in today. I give this book a thumbs up, and applaud this young lady for sharing what she went through so that we as parents can be more aware.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|WOW! That's all I could say when I listened to Born This Way for the first time. This album is so deep and special for Gaga and for all of us Monsters. Every track from Marry The Night all the way to The Edge of Glory has its own meaning and message. Gaga really put a lot of time and work into this record and it shows. There are heavy, dark dance beats (Scheiße, Judas) and fun sing-along stadium tracks (Yoü and I). If you're a fan of Pop music and thinking about buying this album, do not wait any longer! It's worth every penny! Paws up!

B004EPYZZI|5.0|Soul Surfer is an uplifting and inspiring movie based on the true story of Bethanny Hamilton who lost her arm to a shark attack while surfing in Hawaii. Her family's strong faith guides them through the tragedy and helps Bethanny realize that she can use her misfortune to inspire others who have lost limbs and even those who lost everything as she discovers while on a mission trip to the Tsunami stricken Taiwan. The videography is breathtaking (I was fortunate to watch it with my 13 year old in a 3D movie theater). It's a great movie for family and especially teenage girls. We particularly enjoyed watching the documentary included with this DVD of the real Bethanny Hamilton and her family. Dennis Hopper and Helen Hunt play the parents and are great in this movie. Excellent movie and truly inspirational!

B003UESJ9M|2.0|'country strong' has a lot jammed into its 2+ hour length, yet it doesn't really answer any of the \\"who, what, when, or whys\\".....as a result, you have a leading character (gwyneth paltrow) with a tumultous life, yet there's little reason to have any sympathy for her. there's another character--the husband/manager--who we're supposed to accept as the \\"villain\\" of sorts (tim mcgraw)--but instead you might actually feel sympathetic toward HIM after watching what he has to put up with. some people have talked about the \\"suprise\\" ending, which honestly came as no suprise to me (ask my wife, i called it about 40 minutes in, lol). there's so little to know about these characters, i just couldn't have imagined it ending any other way....it was just as simple as playing \\"connect the dots\\". if you're one of those types who HAVE to see this movie, reviews be damned, then at least watch it on cable & not spend your cash on a DVD...
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I do not like the title of this movie.  It just didn't fit in my opinion.  With so much Alice in Wonderland themes, I think a title that references that or dream land would have been much better.    But the movie is GREAT!  Very surprisingly good.  Good effects, good story, good action.    Watch the theatrical release version first, then watch the extended cut.
0545259088|2.0|I liked Shiver. Linger not so much, but it was ok. I really think that the ending was Linger's saving grace. It was such a cliffhanger that you're tricked into believing it was awesome. Forever was just a disappointment! I really felt like the author was just tired of thinking about the series and took the easy way out.<br /><br />My review is really more of a discussion of what I thought about the book, so if you haven't read the book, don't read my review. If you've read the other two books, of course you want to read this one. I'm definitely not trying to talk anybody out of reading it.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />First of all, the part that bugs me the most. The \\"cure\\". Apparently, Sam has been cured. Grace had been cured pretty much by the same \\"cure\\" when she was younger only to find out that she actually had not. Why not? Why did it work for one and not the other? Well, when this is addressed in the book, do you know what the answer is? There's not time for an explanation. What?!!!! We've invested our reading time in this series and there's not time for a proper explanation? We deserve better than that! Then at the end, Grace is possibly going to be cured again by this same method. Craziness!<br /><br />There's so many loose strings in this story. Again, I think the author got tired of thinking.<br /><br />Aside from that, I had a hard time getting into the book. The first half was boring, and if not for reviewing it, I would have gave up on it.<br /><br />I was just hugely disappointed.

This is movie is so good that, if you're one of the Star Wars partisans, you'll consider converting.<br /><br />Brilliant pacing, brilliant script, brilliant villain, brilliant ending.  I love to complain about movies but am drawing a blank on this one:  what's not to like?<br /><br />As just one example of how good the script is:  the movie starts off with the vaunted Admiral Kirk effin' up.  And it's a royal f-up, too.  You just wanna smack him, but that's what makes the script so excellent.  If he had put those shields up as per Starfleet regulations, he would have been boring and predictable, like Aeneas.  As it is, he's human and believable, and that failing draws you into the film.  Definitely the best moment in a movie filled with great moments:  when Kirk fails to say \\"shields up\\".<br /><br />Wish all these Star Trek films were as good.

0792844890|2.0|I only got one laugh out of this whole thing:  when they were fast-forwarding the VHS tape.  The rest of it was well-meant, but I can't understand why this is a \\"cult classic.\\"<br /><br />Legally, though, I couldn't stop wondering why, if the guys from FAMILY GUY were able to do a send-up of the same movie but using all the actual characters, storyline, and Lucas material, why couldn't Brooks?  It would have been so much funnier.  As it was, John Candy playing a half-human / half-dog probably looked a lot funnier on the page than it wound up being on the screen.  Did the law change or something?  Why was Brooks prevented a direct attack but Seth McFarlane allowed one?
0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries provides us with a powerful methodology to help us create something out of nothing. I have personally tried to create dozens of online businesses. Each time, we would make a ton of investment, put a ton of effort trying to create the product while having no idea about the market or even our customers. We were very focused on just building.  We were wasting our time and effort!  We should have been focused on learning what our customers' most important problems were and building things to solve those problems.    The principles outlined in this book have helped me create successful online businesses that are built to learn by experimentation. Both the methodology and the stories in the book will help you understand how to create something out of nothing while increasing your chances of success.     There is no better way to create new products and businesses. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to succeed in today's hyper-competitive business environment.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|With the advent of streaming, easy-to-get video, it's never been simpler to get your hands on old comedies from the 70s and 80s that you enjoyed when you were a kid.<br /><br />Tragically, most of them don't hold up well:  a lot of the comedies that you rewatch this way (e.g., \\"Caddyshack\\"!) don't have a single laugh anymore.<br /><br />But I say the first GHOSTBUSTERS is an exception:  thanks largely to Bill Murray's usual sarcastic demeanor, it doesn't seem to have aged much.  Still a watchable movie.

B000OPOAM0|5.0|The movie Terminator throws us into a world beyond imagination, beyond our own worst fear, and its storyline grips us in its hand as we watch the fight for humanity begin. Our greatest creation has become our worst enemy bent on our annihilation. Our survival rests in the hands of one woman, who will give birth to the one to save us, John Connor. As the days of our future's end unfolds, we are dazzled with brilliant and chilling special effects, glimpses of a world gone dark, and the hope of survival. The music strikes the chords of our soul, and our eyes drink in the passion and strength of two characters brought to life by talented actors. This movie truly defines what we hunger most, which is to know what is waiting for us in the end and will we be able to save ourselves.
B004EPZ09S|1.0|This was seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life; my girlfriend and I walked out after about 90 minutes as it was clear that nothing even mildly interesting was going to occur and there was no possible way to redeem the alleged \\"plot\\".     The writing was awful. The directing was pathetic. The character development was non-existent. The plot was as interesting as watching the Weather Channel. The dialog often seemed to be improvised on the spot, and not in a good/clever way either since the characters themselves were so lacking in depth. There was not a single redeeming quality to this movie.     It was not exciting, interesting, compelling, dramatic, novel...the most that could be said is that it was \\"realistic\\", in the same sense that watching CSPAN coverage of a congressional session is. I have no idea how anyone found this movie watchable, never mind \\"excellent\\".     After this pathetic excuse for a film, I fear that Soderbergh has followed the M. Night Shyamalan route of ineptitude into directorial oblivion.    I realize that some people liked this movie...I don't really understand how that's possible, but then some people like slasher flicks, some people like British humor, and some people even like watching televised political debates. It follows that there are bound to be some who found themselves entertained by this sad, dull not-anywhere-near-as-interesting-as-a-trainwreck of a movie.

The ease and eloquence, the savoring, the revisiting and understanding...genius in so many ways.    This is classic fantasy at its very best.

B0058S0OMS|5.0|Okay, this is a fantastic blu ray transfer.  The images are crisp, clear and sharp. The audio is awesome.  It doesn't get much better than this.<br /><br />The plot is that Halloween 2  picks up right where Halloween leaves off. I mean, the exact second. Laurie is transported to the hospital, and Michael is right behind her.  He pretty much kills off everyone that's between him and her. The question is why is Michael targeting Laurie? What makes her so special? Ahhh....what a great question. In this installment, you find out why he's after her.  I also liked the symbolism in it, that happens at the end.  I can't say what it is, because it would be a spoiler.<br /><br />There is a note of caution to Halloween 2. It's much more violent and graphic that the original, way more.  I can promise that a couple of scenes will make you jump.  :O)<br /><br />As far as sequels go, this is nothing but a classic. If you've seen the first Halloween, and were thinking of getting this in blu ray, then I suggest it. I've seen it several times, and couldn't wait to get it in blu ray.
1416503730|3.0|I guess with all the rave reviews, I was expecting this book to be really good. I was sadly disappointed. I thought the characters were weak. The relationship between the main characters was nothing more than lust. The story was just way too unbelievable and I had a hard time really getting into it.
B005974CDU|5.0|The title of the album \\"A Dramtic Turn of Events\\" rings with much more truth than imagined. Although John Petrucci said the album title had nothing to do with the departure of Mike Portnoy and the infusion of Mike Mangini, the \\"events\\" forced the album title to be the inevitable truth. With unending press releases spured on by the infamous Blabbermouth,snarky comments by the former Drummer, a conspricacy theory started by a cover band gutarist, and banter between Mike portnoy lovers and haters, whew, thigs have definitely been \\"Dramatic\\" if nothing else.    Now let's \\"turn\\" to the album itself. I won't go through a track by track as hunderds will comment about that on this site alone. The album has been a \\"Dramatic Turn of Events\\" in itself. The band has got the motor restarted on the boat and started heading back upstream after a drift downstream and into the seaweed. While nothing was really wrong per se with the last few albums, they started to go in a direction that many fans found a bit too predictable if nothing else. Nothing wrong, just nothing fresh. We all knew the obligatory AA song would be there, along with some overdone metal wankery and a few obligatory growls thrown in here and there. Not enough to really ruin things by any means, just enough to raise a few eyebrows. Also on any of these more recent albums, there were som extremely good songs, but sometimes bookended by just OK selections, the kind you just \\"might\\" skip over.    All that has changed with the new album. The new album starts out very good and continues to get better with each song until by the end it's just  excellent. ADTOE definitely ranks up with Dream Theater's best offerings (depending on your mood for the day). The band is fully re-energized and the massively incredible capabilities of Mike Mangini's drumming is a big part of that newfound energy. Although Mangini is not the \\"in your face\\" drummer that Portnoy was, his phoenominal technicality allows the band to do things they just couldn't do before. Are they better for his additional skills? Maybe (I think so), but they are doing new things?..... absolutely. That's different and that's very important for a group that's been cranking out music for longer than half of their fan base has been alive.    A really SOLID 5 star rating.
0007202288|4.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe   A good book is the type of book that will keep the reader's attention and keep them wanting to read more of that book or author.  The story in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very interesting story. It's interesting because  it's a story about this magic land inside of a coat closet, so it get you think about how Narnia got in a closet.  The story is age-appropriate,   and it would appeal to the kids because it is a Fantasy and Adventure story.  That type of age group loves stories that have adventure. The book is very well written and easy to understand; C.S. Lewis is a good author. It is easy to conclude from the title and formation of the book that it has something to do with a lion, a witch and a wardrobe.    The theme of the story is that good will triumph over evil and that you have got to have trust in people.  Yes the theme is worth conveying to children to let them know that good will overpower evil with the right tools and attitude.  The theme is moralistic and it may be a little overly moralistic to some people because of the religious connection. In my opinion the theme is not overly moralistic.    The plot of the story is very well constructed. It introduces you to the land of Narnia, and sets each piece of the story in the right spot at the right time. It's not a confusing plot, it's a very easy plot to follow.  The plot of the story is original and fresh, but the believable part is a little hard.  You have to try and really work to believe kids have the power to save a whole magical land.  All the characters, especially Lucy, seem really convincing and credible.  They all grow from the experience in different ways, some grow in imagination and some in trust, and all four kids are changed by going to the land of Narnia.    This is a very good story for all ages to read; it has the important elements of a great story, the laughter and the tears. You learn from this book really fast who is good and who isnot. It has symbolism to reading that is really subtle, but if you pay attention, you will pick up on it.  I like the book because of the air of mystery with what is in the wardrobe and at first only one of the kids, Lucy, believes in Narnia. It is a really good book that all kids need to read. You will like it; it is one of my favorites.       [[ASIN:0007202288 Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia S.)]]

0307887898|5.0|Eric has done an incredible job cutting to the heart of what actually makes startups succeed. For years he has shared grounded advice based on a mix of scientific method, lean manufacturing, customer development and (candidly shared) personal lessons learned in startups. He has turned the \\"lean startup\\" idea into a movement. The ideas are powerful enough to motivate entrepreneurs in over a hundred cities to organizer regular Lean Startup Meetups to exchange notes and build on the practice. This book builds on the practical advice he has shared on his blog with a useful mix of theory and story-telling. Since reading it, I have found myself questioning key aspects of how I measure the progress my company is making as a result. Very useful. I highly recommend.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. The changes George made with the special editions was bad enough, but he's not completely neutered Darth Vader.     The biggest travesty is that Lucas is making all these changes and the only movie in the original trilogy that he wrote or directed was A New Hope. I'm sure Jedi's director wouldn't agree with that Vader \\"Nooooooooo\\"    I was going to buy the Blu Rays, but not anymore

Fantastic combination of unclassifiable jazz-funk-rock instrumentals and vocals.  \\"Buckjump\\" sucks you in - and the rest will not let you go.    The instrumentation is tight.  The beats are hot.

B005CMSDLE|2.0|Before I watched this movie, I thought it would be an exciting one.  Hanna is a girl raised by her father in the woods.  She learns everything there is to know about survival and protecting herself from any threats (human or not) from her father.  Her father is an ex-CIA agent.<br /><br />The first part of the movie was good.  However, the rest (or most) the movie was very predictable.  The plot was basically a one big chase, and the final showdown.  Another problem with this movie was over the top sound effects and the music, both of which was very distracting.  This movie was made in such a way that the viewer would have to fill in lots and lots of blanks without questioning any of it.  At some point you think it is just not worth it.<br /><br />There is some action in it, but nothing like the Bourne series.

B004V2S4SS|5.0|For any fan who has LOVED Medium -- and I am certainly one of them -- it is extremely hard to say goodbye.  I watched the 7th season DVDs; and when I got to Joe's bumpy plane ride, I immediately turned it off saying, \\"Oh no!\\"  It took me about three weeks to get up the nerve to watch that final episode.  That said, the seventh season continued to shine with the originality of the other seasons.  One of my favorite episodes is \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" with Allison's dreams giving her increasingly specific tips about a homeless man who is a killer.  The episode also has the outworking of Joe's mother's story and a fine performance by Kathy Baker as guest star in that role.  \\"Talk to the Hand\\" was almost humorous at times with Allison's hand taking control of its own actions, much to Allison's dismay and those around her.  \\"Native Tongue\\" was also amazingly unique where Allison loses the ability to understand English and can only communicate verbally in a Native American language.  The very final frames of the last episode were as sweet as they were bittersweet.  This is the one show where each season had incredible stories and performances.  Patricia Arquette, Jake Weber, Maria Lark and David Cubitt all seem like family friends; I've spent so many hours watching them.  A fond farewell!  Bravo!

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|\\"Own the Night\\" is the third studio album by Lady Antebellum and picks up right where they left off with last year's \\"Need You Now.\\" They have an impressive track record which includes being awarded Top New Group by the Academy of Country Music and New Artist of the Year by the Country Music Association in 2008. They were then nominated for a total of 4 Grammy Awards in 2009 and 2010, winning one of them for Best Country Performance for the song \\"I Run To You.\\" In 2010 they won Top Vocal Group and Song of the Year (\\"Need You Now\\") at the ACM Awards and took home 5 Grammy Awards in 2011.     The first track, \\"We Owned The Night\\" is the perfect start to the album: An upbeat tune that has lots of energy and will make you jump out of your chair and start to dance. The lyrics are nothing short of poetic and inspired by dreams of a once in a lifetime moment of passion. Singer Hillary Scott says the album was named after these sentiments. The mandolin that Dave Haywood plays adds an amazing texture that enhances the song with charisma and a hint of bluegrass influence.  \\"Just a Kiss\\" was the first single and made its debut last spring on American Idol. It debuted at number 7 on Billboard's top 100, the highest debut by a country artist in over 52 years. \\"Dancing Away With My Heart\\" was co-written with Josh Kear, the same person who helped write \\"Need You Now.\\" The song is everything a country tune should be: deep, meaningful lyrics, excellent musicianship, and passionate singing and playing. The song is so familiar I was humming away with it the first time I listened. Another highlight is \\"As You Turn Away,\\" a song with a catchy hook and incredible vocal melodies and harmonies. If you liked Lady Antebellum's two previous albums, or if you're a fan of country music, you'll love this. Highly recommended!!
B005E7AOLY|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Primus fan.  They're probably my second favorite band after The Melvins.  I feel like I owe so much of my musicianship to this band and I'm definitely a bit biased when it comes to Les Claypool's material.  However, I've always found Les Claypool's solo material to be a bit lacking.  While I usually like it okay it doesn't stay in my cd player very long.    With that said this is without a doubt a Primus album and not a Les Claypool solo album.  The somewhat dark feeling combined with Ler's guitar playing and the overall addictiveness of the album sets it apart from every non Primus thing he's done in the past decade.  I do understand where people are coming from when they say it sounds like Les Claypool's solo albums but that's what happens when half of the instruments are in one band (including vocals as an instrument).  The difference is that this time around Les put Primus on the back burner in favor of his solo albums and in the 90's he barely had any solo albums.  There was Sausage which could almost be considered a Primus album anyway because it was the original lineup.  There was also Highball With the Devil which people seem to have forgotten sounded a lot like a predecessor to the Brown Album.  It shouldn't surprise people that the song writing is similar.    On to the actual album, I had mixed feelings at first.  Of course I couldn't wait to hear new Primus so I heard the live versions of these songs months ago.  At first I was disappointed and thought these songs sounded too similar to older efforts.  All I could hear when I heard Last Salmon Man was Here Come the Bastards, Rapscallion when I heard Eyes of the Squirrel, Bodacious when I heard Tragedy and so on.  Eventually these songs really grew on me and I don't hear it anymore.  These are unique Primus songs and the whole album has a vibe to it the way Pork Soda, Brown, Tales, and so on do.    However there are two big complaints that I'm sure even a lot of die hard Primus fans are going to have.  The first one is Les' obsession with the envelope filter effect.  Did Les really think it needed to be used on FOUR songs?!?!  The thing gets tiresome and I only think it adds something to Eyes of the Squirrel and the harmonics in Extinction Burst.  That effect alone will probably be the number one reason people think this sounds more like a solo project than a Primus album but remember the effect was first used in The Final Voyage of the Liquid Sky; which I still think is the best use of the effect to date.   Regardless I think the song writing is strong enough to ignore the effect but I can't help but wonder what some of these songs would sound like without it.    The next big compliant will be the production.  Jay's drums are really buried in the mix and it makes them sound really tiny.  Moron TV was one of my favorite live tracks but the studio version....I don't know.  Ler is buried a little bit but that's how every Primus album has been.  Les also uses the bullet mic a lot and it makes his voice buried at times too.  I rarely complain about production on albums but I feel like they could have done a much better job on this album.  It's not too bad though.    In the end it doesn't sound like a rehash, the musicianship is incredible, and most importantly the songs are catchy, fun, and memorable.  Unfortunately I feel like it falls a little short of classic status.  I strongly believe that in ten years when people are getting into Primus their friends will continue to recommend getting the 90-96 albums before getting the later material.  But in the end I'm just really happy to finally get another Primus album.  I'll be listening to this one for years to come.      Here's how I rate it compared to other albums using Mark Prindle's scale so only one album gets the 10.    Suck On This - 8.5/10  Frizzle Fry- 9/10  Sailing the Seas of Cheese - 10/10  Misc Debris - 9/10  Pork Soda - 9/10  Tales From the Punchbowl - 9/10  Brown Album - 9/10  Rhinoplasty - 8/10  Antipop - 7/10  Animals... - 7/10  June 2010 Rehearsal - 7/10  Green Naugahyde - 8/10    Sausage - Riddles Are Abound Tonight - 7/10  Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel - Highball with the Devil - 7/10  Frog Brigade - Live Frogs Set 1 - 6/10  Frog Brigade - Live Frogs Set 2 - 8/10  Oysterhead - The Grand Pecking Order - 5/10  Frog Brigade - Purple Onion - 6/10  Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains - The Big Eyeball in the Sky - 5/10  Les Claypool - Of Whales and Woe 7.5/10  Les Claypool - Of Fungi and Foe - 3/10    PS The vinyl comes with the cd so I'd recommend getting the vinyl instead.  The clear green records look very cool!

B005E7AOHI|5.0|In a year (decade?) that has been largely free of great rock records (Them Crooked, Foo Fighters, Big Talk, Mastodon and a handful others excepted), it's so damned great to hear Primus get back to basics and deliver some seriously mindful rock.     Oh, and you need to buy five. One for you, and four for the people who will love you for the gift. That hot girl/guy down the hall/next door/at work? Yeah, s/he needs this record... and will reward you by fulfilling your every fantasy. Worked for me, this trick, and it can work for you.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Last night I finished reading I Am Legend and have to say: WHAT AN ENDING!! It is an incredibly original story because of the point of view from which Matheson chooses to narrate, to then turn the tables in the ending, leaving you every bit as astounded with the revelation as the main character is.<br /><br />When the movie came out a few years ago, I liked it; it was scary and I thought Will Smith had done an amazing job at supporting the movie by himself. Now, after reading the book, I will never look at it the same way. It totally misses what makes the book so incredibly original and it makes so many changes to the story that renders it almost unrecognizable. In sum, the film story doesn't hold a candle to the one of the pages.<br /><br />I have to say, though, the section where the main character is going through medical knowledge to explain himself the basis of the 'infection' gave me a stomachache. If you follow me and my work, you know I'm an MD. I don't know if the medical knowledge was that much far back in 1954, or if Matheson just picked and chose whatever he needed and made it fit the story, but I tell you: It was physically painful. Chances are, you aren't as versed in Physiology and won't notice a thing, so by all means, don't let this detail keep you from reading such a wonderful story.<br /><br />I enjoyed the whole experience very much and was unable to put the book down from the moment I turned the first page. In my opinion, the story is a lot better thought out than Matheson's Hell House though the aforementioned has a richer vocabulary. I recommend it thoroughly and is now, among my favourite books ever.

B005E7AOHI|4.0|Primus is back!!! For me this album is a little bit Sailing the Seas, throw in some Brown album, and a pinch of the South Park theme song and you'll have an idea of what this album is about. Drummer Jay Lane is outstanding. He's a mix of Herb and Brain. Very simple yet intricate. LaLonde is in rare form and on tracks such as Hennepin Crawler, Moron Tv, and Hoinfodaman you'll understand my Seas comparison. The grooves on this album are tight and crisp. I'm liking it better with each spin as well. Tweak on!!!!
0143113100|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend studying neuroscience.  It's put together as a compilation of many stories of people who have experienced how the plasticity of the human brain can bring someone back from adverse, disabling circumstances.  I found each chapter/story awe-inspiring.  Doidge does a wonderful job keeping the language technical enough to be specific and informative but also accessible to people who haven't had much background on the subject.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for more positive information on the brain and how it works.  Be prepared to bring this book everywhere you go, because you won't want to put it down once you start!

The film does feature the stark contrast between the haves and have nots within the absolutely stunning nation.

B0053VKP8S|3.0|Device was delivered as advertised, ahead of schedule.  Generally works well, except that there are occasional audio dropouts when background sound effects or music from movie DVDs are being processed, apparently due to \\"clipping\\" of high-amplitude overall volume or high-or-low tone components.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so addictive!<br /><br />I have the PC version, so when I saw Amazon had it as a free app I couldn't resist. I downloaded it on my Asus Eee Transformer and it runs smoothly with no issues---the graphics are only slightly fuzzy [because of the bigger screen size duh].<br /><br />If you've never played it, do give it a chance!
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|The blue-ray version of the director's cut was excellent, from picture quality to the soundtrack. When I saw that the original theatrical release version was included, I was especially pleased. This is still probably the best film ever made about submarine warfare during the Battle of the North Atlantic, and stands as a testament to the courage of the sailors of both sides of the conflict, the sufferings and sacrifices and the tragedies that marked that dark era. Peterson should do a film on the Royal Navy's side of the war before he passes from the stage........
B005G48Y58|4.0|The trailer may exaggerate the amount of action that is in the movie. Hanna has a modest amount of violence compared to what I was expecting. However, the movie is still exciting.    The movie has an impressive cast and it looks like the director, Joe Wright, took full advantage of the talented people he worked with on the film. I cannot point out any flaws in the performances. Based on the roles each individual was given, none of them disappoint.     The roles themselves are a different matter. The developments of the main characters are not very strong. Even with an hour and 50 minutes, it feels like the characters are emotionally shallow. This is kind of a difficult thing to point out because if Joe Wright decided to linger on the feelings of each main character, the movie would have been extended, which may have lead to a slow, boring pace.    Instead of a sluggish, monotonous tempo, Joe Wright goes with a faster, exciting rate. Considering how the events unfold, everything appears to happen relatively fast. One must keep in mind that a persistent government agent, aided by ruthless, resourceful thugs, is hunting down a little girl. The antagonists seem to always be on her tail. Based on their methods, the agent and her thugs keep the tension of the movie high.    The excitement of the story is amplified by the music. Hanna is a fine example of how the soundtrack can be crucial to storytelling. The best scenes of the movie tend to be accompanied by the sounds of The Chemical Brothers.    Finally, the action is probably the main attraction based on the trailer. While I did mention that the action is modest, the fight and chase scenes are spectacular. When I say modest, I imply that the frequency of the action is modest. Hanna is not the type of action movie that incorporates intricate fighting sequences in every other scene. The makers of the movie do a fine job of balancing story structure and fight choreography.    My rating of this movie is four stars, but therating reflects the fact that I rented the movie for $3.99. Hanna is a sweet movie for a $3.99 rental. If I saw this movie in the theaters or if I purchased a copy for my collection, I would have given Hanna a three, if not two, star rating. This is the type of movie that a person watches once and seldom views certain scenes.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This product is fantastic. I have had them for a while now and they are the best I have ever owned. Originally I was looking for some nice headphones. But then I saw this headset, and the reviews said the sound quality was good for the price. What an understatement! I am not an audiophile however this headset is a clear winner in terms of sound. Also they are extremely durable and wireless feature is over the top. They have a great amount of range as I can walk all over my house with no signal loss. Overall this is a fantastic product and I would recommend it for anyone from gaming enthusiasts to the casual music lover.[[ASIN:B003VANOFY Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]]
0062008528|1.0|I have read bad books in my life, but this one gets the prize. Too many characters with strange names. Too many locales to get lost and so poorly planned, you have to rewind to find out where you are coming from. I could not continue after ½ of the book as I could not identify who was talking to whom and where at.<br />I purchased another 2 books of the same author which I'm returning as I don't want to fight the book to find out where am I and what I'm doing.<br /><br />Sorry, but I have never given a negative review to a book, as I rather hold back and not write about it.<br /><br />I just wanted to warn other readers about it, before they would find they wasted a couple of days reading and spent good money on a bad book..
0062103377|5.0|I was very excited to get to read this book in the Supernatural series because so often Bobby Singer gets left out in this series. His is a character that is taken for granted a lot.I think the author gave voice to  the character very well and stayed true to Jim Beaver's portrayal of the character. Very interesting story line. I am wondering why though that it was not put into the timeline of the series like the other books were . They usually tell us between what episodes things in the books occurred. That would have been a nice reference point. Over all very enjoyable.
B000Q79HTC|2.0|It could have been a good movie, pretty good plot.  But the producer opted for lots of filler - violence instead of good acting and camera action so fast it makes you dizzy from not being able to focus on a scene for more than 1/10 of a second! Watched it to the end, but was disappointed with the lack of real quality.  Really hated that most of the movie involved the camera swinging back and forth, up and down and around.  It was enough to give one a seizure!

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Originally, I saw this film on a whim.  If nothing else, I was curious how the whole \\"Planet of the Apes\\" saga was going to start since that story had not been told in detail.  But after the last movie, the expectation was low, as I imagine most who went to see this film.  The first thing to understand is that Ceasar is the main character of the story.  James Franco is a supporting role, but he is the glue character that holds the details together.  John Lithgow was very creditable in the his role.  Just about everyone else is a walking backdrop with one detail to add to the story.  It's all about Ceasar, but that's actually a good thing.  His growing up and origins was the story.  It built up at a perfect pace so by the final sequence, you're ready to strip down to a loin cloth and go on a rampage with rest of the animals.  That stated, there are some typical Hollywood embellishments.  The number of apes kept growing as the movie went along...for no logical reason.  The scientist are more clueless than one would expect.  If you're going to use apes for an experiment, you would figure they would know more about basic behaviour.  Finally, the next door neighbor was just so overdone it was comical - they needed a guy for us to hate but it was cartoonish how stupid this guy was.  But even with the obvious holes, it is a compelling story told well enough to fill the space alotted without being over done.

B00009L1UP|4.0|So with this album, and every one since, Queensryche lost their connection with metal, if you could call anything after Warning metal anyways. They put out an overly polished hit laden release made for the masses in 1990. But that doesn't mean this is a bad album. Quite the contrary. You'll find mostly good to very good and a few great songs on here. Overall I like the sound of this album ok, but I wish there were more heavier songs, a complaint about pretty much every album of their's from this one on.   As with all the older albums Tate's voice is solid. There are plenty of hooks to be found here, it's a sell out album after all. And random tangent, but Why in the world do people consider these guys prog metal? they aren't even metal, nor are they progressive, except for 1 song on Mindcrime, and maybe Anybody listening from here. The music is played competantly, nothing too impressive except on Silent Lucidity and Anybody Listening, which are really cool pieces, and a couple cool bass lines in certain songs.   Best I Can 8/10 is a decent opener. Actually it's a pretty good one. It starts with some weird keyboards and some vocal samples. Then some piano kicks in and Tate starts singing. Then the rest of the song kicks in and is overall a relative rocker, for this album anyways. Nice vocals. the intro is pretty cool. this is actually one of my favorite songs on here, there just happen to be quite a few good songs on this one.   Thin Line 9/10 don't really know the point of that couple second nothing intro, but the song itself is good. This one's kind of a mix of harder and softer, mostly softer, with heavier choruses, intro, after the pointless couple seconds of silence. The verses are fairly soft. Great hooks, as you'd expect from an album like this. Heck if they could put these hooks in their new music it wouldn't suck so bad. The second verse is a little better. There's a cool bass line, and the guitars kick in more. It all comes together to make a really good song.   Jet City Woman, 9/10 is another of the first Ryche songs I ever heard, Bridge being the first. This is another soft, heavier chorus type song. A lot of them on here. Musically there isn't anything special, except the classic bass to start the song. It's just a very good pop rock song.   Della Brown 5/10, meh. This is a very blah song. It'd be so much better if it were shorter, but 7 minutes? Really? For this? It's a very quiet song. I'd preferred Last Time In Paris Real World, or Scarborough Fair to this crap. Ok it's not that bad, it's just boring. Nothing really happens in the song. Kind of cool drum beat, but I'm skipping this one as I write this, still listening to Jet City Woman. But I remember this one well. Frankly there isn't much to remember. If this were a 4 minute song that's help it a lot. It does transition between its neighboring songs very well.   Another Rainy Night, Without You 8/10, awh Tate got lonely.. How sweet.. Ok so this is a cheesy ballad, well not as bad as many more popolar ones from the time. Still it's a bit cheesy. Still it's a pretty good song. nothing really special.   Empire 9/10 Tate tries his hand at rap rock, sort of. Thankfully the lyrics are better than bi---es and ho-s. It's the first song on the album to make me actually feel something. I say that, but still most of the previous songs are very good, with 1 exception, but this being a pop rock album, means there's just a lack of substance. Eh I'll get into that after the songs. Like the voicemail message intro. They did put these songs together with some good transitions. Very drum beat focused song. I said this about a song on Promised Land, but if in trying to write music that was more rhythm based, for DTC they'd written something this good, that album would have been better for it. Overall a very good song, and easily my favorite rap rock song, mainly because it's more rock than crap.   Resistance 9/10 easily, well probably the most rocking song on the album, Empire aclose second. Definitely the heaviest/fastest song on here, which doesn't say much for the album. Still it's a good song, and a welcome change of pace from all those pop rock ballads from the beginning of the album. This song has a decent riff and a great hook in the chorus. Don't really need anything else, well.. Decent lyrics. It has those too.   Silent Lucidity 10/10 one of the reasons I save perfect scores is for songs like this. I get chills whenever I hear the second verse. Awesome guitar work in this song. The solo isn't anything flashy, but it fits well. Overall just a beautiful song.   Hand On Heart 8/10 is a sort of rocker I guess.. For this album anyways. Kind of mid tempo. It's a pretty good song. Nothing really special here, just a good song.   One And Only 7/10 is another sort of rocker, slower than the last song. Still it's a decent song, Tate's lonely again. Someone should give him a hug, cause apparently now, 2011 \\"he's got it bad. soo soo bad.\\" Uh horrible song, that one not the one I'm rating now.   Anybody Listening 10/10 another song that gives me chills. It's another soft song, with a bit of an overdramatic part here and there, but I love it. Overall it just has a really cool sound to it, and is a good way to end the album.   I haven't heard the remaster, don't really think this one needed it, but whatever. I know all 3 bonus tracks and they're all very good too. I put them with a mix of the EP amongst other b sides and such to make a whole album.   Overall this is a very good album. It just lacks the substance that makes a great album. Writing music for the masses will do that. Still this is the most excessible of their albums, so possibly a good place to start, or Mindcrime or Rage for order. All 3 are considered mostly as their best.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book will help others to understand why she didnt run.  It is written on about the level of where she was when she was kidnapped - 11 to 15 year old - but kept my attention.  It is a very interesting, quick read and a must for anyone that questions what was she thinking.
B0000931QA|5.0|First off if you're a fan, then why don't you have this cd?  If you're new to the band, then this is definitely a good place to start.      I'm not a big fan of concept albums.  Especially ones released today, they end up, like with the sequal to this one, to have some good songs and a lot of filler, plus some bad ones, but of course with there being a story it feels like you have to keep them all to have the full grasp of the album.  Not a problem here, as the songs are all very good.    This album has a great sound to it.  Albums just don't sound like this anymore.  Well that's because the record companies have decided that bands should all sound the same.  Uh why?  The musicianship is very solid.  Especially in the epic Sister Mary.  tate's voice is in top form.  He kind of finds a balance on this one and the previous between singing and screaming, although the screams would be gone by Empire.  sadness...  I haven't heard the remaster, so I can't comment on that.  the original sounds just fine to me, but if the remaster sounds good then no reason not to get that one.  I don't get why they tagged all those live songs at the end.  With a cd I like to be able to listen to it straight through, and I don't want live songs on there, but whatever.  It'd be different if they were cover songs or unreleased songs, but whatever.  It's been 8 years since they did it, so no use complaining about it now.  Heck I don't even have these remasters, so who cares?    I'll skip the instrumentals and mini tracks, which there were too many for my liking, and them running into real songs kind of makes some of the transitions choppy.  Minor complaint though.  Overall it's a very good album.    Revolution Calling 8/10 nice mid tempo rocker to start the album.  Very anti government lyrics, as this album generally is.  Tate would never sound like this again.  Nice guitar work.  Overall it's just a good song.    Operation Mindcrime 8/10  another very good song.  There's not a whole lot to it.  some nice guitar work.  A nice hook in the chorus.      Speak 8/10 faster song than the previous 2.  I love the verses, and the riffs.  Nice energy to the song.    Spreading The Disease 9/10 has a nice drum beat to start the song out.  Also, to end it as well as it has a nice transition into the next song.  Overall it's another faster rocker.  Love the vocals on this one, as well as the riffs.  How someone could become enamored with a whore is beyond me, but whatever.  Love the bridge, and how it builds to the last chorus.    Mission 9/10 starts with an acoustic part, before moving into a mid tempo rocker.  Tate sings with a lot of passion, eh kind of strange to write that, considering their output over the past decade or so.  But it's true.  Great vocals, love the guitar work, especially the acoustic part at the beginning.    Suite Sister Mary 10/10, oddly enough I didn't like this song at first.  Well...  At least after I knew the rest of the album well it gave me another gem to fall in love with.  LOVE the clean guitar work in the intro, the choral vocals, weird sound effects, it's all good.  The song ends up erupting into a rocker, with some nice drum beats, and we get a guest vocalist, don't remember her name.  If someone had showed me this song as the first song to hear by them, and told me they were a prog rock band, I'd have believed them.  Course there really isn't much else progressive about them.  they're early stuff is just awesome.  Also when he sings about the priest being cold I get chills, oh man this is a good song.    The Needle Lies 8/10 probably the weakest of the actual songs, but I still enjoy it enough to give it an 8.  Overall it's a fast paced rocker.  the chorus is a bit weak, but it's good enough.  Nothing else really special about it.    Breaking The Silence 9/10 another of my favorite songs on here.  It's kind of a softer song, for this album.  It's not really a ballad by any means.  Nice drum work.  Love the chorus.    I Don't Believe In Love 9/10 amen..  Love the guitars, especially the intro.  Great chorus.  A Queensryche classic, as is this album.  Love the drum beat, the rhythm section help make the verses in this song, as I've said in reference to a couple other songs, if they'd used songs like this for inspiration in making a more rhythm centered album for DTC then it'd probably have turned out much better, well it really couldn't have been worse.    Eyes Of A Stranger 10/10 another song with its moments that give me chills.  Love this one, and it's a great way to end the album.  I love the second verse, when Tate is screaming, \\"Is this all this life has for me\\" or something like that.  awesome.  Great chorus.    Overall this album kind of feels like what the band was progressing towards, and they definitely peaked both with this one and the previous album, Rage For Order.  Although I enjoy the next 3 albums, they definitely took some steps backwards, and even more so once Chris left the band.  As of the date on this review they haven't recovered, in fact they just keep getting worse.  But that's why I reviewed AS and DTC along with the rest of their discography, well I'm working my way back, so I have 3 more to go.    Overall as I said if you're looking for a good introduction into this band this is the album to pick up.  I'd say it's easily their best, except Rage is also fantastic, those 2 are easily their 2 best, but I couldn't pick between them.  they're both fantastic.
0385534639|5.0|If someone had asked me to rate this book three-fourths of the way through, I am positive that I would not be so favorable.<br /><br />Then I got to the end.<br /><br />And I finally got it.<br /><br />You know all about this book already, don't you?<br /><br />  \\"The Circus arrives without warning.\\"<br /><br />Indeed. This book takes place in a Circus, for the most part. Le Cirque des Rêves (The Circus of Dreams) is a magnificent circus, open only at night, and made up of tents full of wonders and amazingness that I can't even begin to describe to you. And I won't try-Erin Morgenstern is a fantastic artist who writes the way dreams are made.<br /><br />The prose is beautiful. The descriptions are vibrant and made me feel as if I were there-and that's kind of the point.<br /><br />From the outset, you realize that there are basically three storylines going on within the book: the Circus itself, which includes Celia and Marco and the competition that they are involved in, a boy named Bailey, who seems as though he doesn't really fit into the story, and you-as a patron, experiencing some of the wondrous sights and sounds and tastes of the Circus.<br /><br />Of course, I'm oversimplifying it, because each one of these storylines is very detailed and intricate, and it is downright confusing.<br /><br />Until it isn't.<br /><br />There are so many things that I want to tell you about this book, but the number one thing I want to say is keep reading. This isn't a fast read by any means. It's all so real, so much. And every single inconsequential thing comes into play. Erin Morgenstern is a master storyteller-she's simply brilliant. And I cannot begin to understand the way even the most trivial statement made in passing proved to be absolutely monumental. I'm utterly blown away.<br /><br />I don't usually like the film adaptation of books, but in this case, I am crazy excited. Summit has lots of brilliant material to work with, and I hope they do a good job. It has the potential to be amazing.<br /><br />You follow me-you know I have to tell you about the romance. I'm hesitant to say anything about it but feel that I have to. This book is built up to be an epic, all-consuming romance, and that's true. But you don't know it until the last third of the book.<br /><br />But ohmigod when you feel it-it's just...yeah. Epic. Sweeping. Swoon.<br /><br />The things Marco says. The fact that he associates her with love poems and Shakespearian Sonnets. His ability to be himself with her. Gosh. I don't even know what else to say.<br /><br />All of the characters, though shrouded in mystery, are distinct and multi-dimensional. The parts of them that are exposed to us are real and leave you begging for another glimpse. Though I wanted to get to know them more, I didn't ever feel that they were lacking in character or authenticity. While I had many *gasp! I can't believe that just happened* moments, I never felt like they were acting OOC. I love that about this book.<br /><br />I also love Widget.<br /><br />A lot.<br /><br />There are a few things that I didn't love. Being confused most of the book is definitely one of them. I hated Hector and feel almost as strongly about Alexander, but I'm not sure. I also would like to have understood slightly more about the aging of the characters, especially the original attendees of the Midnight Dinners, and what will happen to everyone who is still involved with the Circus. Of course I wanted more ha! Though everything came together at the end (and splendidly so), I just don't know that the amount of confusion and wth?!? was necessary.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil any more of the plot for you than I already have, and telling you anything else really would do that. There are a few things that I wish that I had known before I started reading, so I want to share. I wish that I knew something about Tarot Cards. I know absolutely nothing, and even looking them up didn't offer me very much insight to a partof the book that I felt to be significant. I wish I hadn't been totally in the dark about that. Also, I wish I had written down the timeline, or paid more attention to it. There were several instances that I found myself flipping back and forth, trying to remember where they were and when it was. I very much would like to read this book again, and when I do, I will be taking notes lol Also, I want to tell you what is probably the most important thing:<br /><br />If you don't know what the hell is going on throughout most of the book, that's okay. It'll make sense eventually. Just enjoy the ride. And trust-you will.<br /><br />You know me and stars. If I could give half-stars, I'd give it 4-1/2. But I'm rounding up for the sheer brilliance of the story, for the awesome imagery and detail, and for Widget, whom I love with a fiery passion ::swoonysigh::.more attention to it.

It has rhythm, rhyme, fabulous illustrations, colors, concepts, counting, and of course, a hidden green sheep.  Everything a toddler needs.  This is a favorite in baby music class.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|An incredible insult to the memories of the murdered millions and that Amazon offers it makes Jeff Bezos a purveyor of the worst form of obscenity . Shame on all those who had a hand in making this  ugliness. Takes the prize for the most offensive excrement I've ever encountered in any medium .  However , not a case for censorship  but certainly an example for the need to respect the victims of genocidal murder and the realization that some things are not done , not even for money .
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great movie for two year old and up.  My only issues are several times when one character hits or slaps another.  Also several times one character will say \\"Shut up\\" to another.  These are things that we never ever do in front of our children.  Otherwise, it's a great movie.

B000BI0WOA|4.0|Most of the songs on this cd set are rather non-descript(particularly the 2nd cd). The duet with Emilou Harris is the best cut other  than the classic hits.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|When people ask my what my favorite movies are, the Star Wars saga has always been on the top of my list.  Growing up, I considered myself a tremendous fan that not only collected as much Star Wars memorabilia as possible, but watched the movies as often as I could.  As a teenager, I built a web site dedicated to the films, which in turn influenced my decision to be a software developer today.  It goes without saying that these movies changed my life.<br /><br />But after the release of the Special Editions in 1997, there were so many awkward changes to the original trilogy that sitting through a viewing was difficult.  I am not going to focus on all of the changes made to this release; that has all been said one thousands times.  What I do want to say is I am not sure why I still call myself a fan of Star Wars.  I haven't watched A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi in over a decade.  The original versions of the original trilogy are too engrained into my nerdy soul, and it bitters me to see all of the changes to what were once my favorite films.<br /><br />Most of us know the story about the student who convinced George Lucas that the final movie should not be called \\"Revenge of the Jedi,\\" because the revenge is against the Jedi mantra.  It is too bad that George does not listen to his audience any more, because we are all screaming what we want.  I will not be purchasing the blu-ray saga, not only because of the evolving mass of changes made to the films, but because by definition I am no longer a fan.<br /><br />\\"I'm not a big favorite with the critics, but who listens to them? I'm not a big industry favorite either, but of course they are a bunch of studio executives. The most important people for any filmmaker, the reason that I make films, is for you! The audience rules! Thank you. Thank you very much!\\"<br />--George Lucas
0743455967|5.0|This is an incredible book by Stephen King which walks you though his life of writing, his bad times, and when he got lucky.  Very inspirational, a lot of good advice for an aspiring writer, and also has advice on publishing and he cites examples of how he got bad deals when he published in the beginning and though he was getting a good deal - a must read!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|\\"Sucker Punch\\" had to have been one of the best movies that I've seen in awhile. Despite many negative reviews that other people may have said about this movie, I found it to be engaging, mystifying, and thrilling. I especially enjoyed watching the \\"fantasies\\" that Baby Doll imagined, one of my favorites being the World War Two steam-punk zombie scene. :)
B000HZD168|4.0|\\"Wrath of Khan\\" is my favorite \\"original cast\\" Star Trek movie and it was the one I used to introduce the series to my kids after having them first watch the episode \\"Space Seed\\", which the movie was based on.<br /><br />No spoilers from me: The story starts with the search for a suitable planet to test an new Federation funded science experiment entitled \\"Genesis\\" that ends up encountering the survivors of the \\"Botany Bay\\", lead by Khan(Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n) who was (in the \\"Space Seed\\" episode) marooned by Kirk. While this was happening, Admiral Kirk was helping to train a new crew of mostly cadets on the Enterprise and, as fate\writers would have it, happened to be in the area when Khan takes an interest in the Genesis project. From there we learn more about Kirk's past, get introduced to new characters (Lt. Saavik), here Kirk yell \\"KHHAAAAAAANNN\\" (love that), and get the plot device to make the next movie.<br /><br />Despite several liberties taken with the previous story line, like Chekov being recognized by Khan when he was not cast in \\"Space Seed\\", this gets most important elements right and is a good representation of the Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0307946711|1.0|The novel had National Bestseller on the cover.  The cover said it had been made into a movie.  That and the slick photo suckered me into reading this regrettably boring excuse for a novel.  I read more than a third of this book but that was it for me. I really tried to find some positive aspect to goad me into reading further but when I got to the school play, page 170 or so,  and the funky,improbable name of the principal of the school was mentioned, I just couldnt take it any more-- the principal's name was so rediculous that I threw the book on the floor in a rage. You never feel like you've gained ground with the characters or the plot, it's like you're wasting your valuable time.  I've read better books that weren't made into movies and weren't even bestsellers.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|The worst movie I've seen in years. Over the top pretentious. I would have left a third of the way through but I thought my wife wanted to see it only to find out after it ended that she felt the same as me. We wondered why so many big names signed on for it. I've since read Sean Penn's remarks that the original script was wonderful. He implied that something went terribly wrong in the production. The story of the working class Texas family could have made a good movie but it was overwhelmed by the simplistic scientific and religious shell in which it was placed. Maybe it was meant to appeal to religious fundamentalists but then there was all that evolutionary stuff. All in all a genuinely awful movie. Worth seeing only if you enjoy train wrecks. But wait for Netflix.

0375826742|5.0|This is a great book, filled with action. Has sizable length which makes it a nice buy and is for all SciFi loving audiences, though it tends to be a little on the adolescent theme on relationships to the main character. However, this book is great at bringing up, facing and changeling questions of morality and the greater good without seeming philosophical.

B005974CNA|5.0|I won't go into an in depth analysis of each nook & cranny of every guitar line, interlude, snare hit, arrangement, structure, etc. - That is (and should be) completely unnecessary. The bottom line is: Does the album move you, and is it successful in being a collection of songs that flow with purpose and musical satisfaction. The answer to those questions (at least for me) is \\"Yes\\". I can't remember listening to a DT release that flowed as well & has been as cohesive as this one. Musically, and melodically, the band sound refreshed and re-inspired. As well as sounding confident and hungry again, the songs also sound \\"free\\" and more \\"natural\\".     From listening to this release, you can tell that there was clearly friction and stress going on in the band (either consciously or subconsciously) that was contributing to uneven results in albums like BC&SL & SC. Gone are the half hearted attempts at being a thrash metal band, and trying to copy what other bands have been doing or chasing directions that have been considered \\"current\\". You can also tell that, internally, the band was being pulled into directions that weren't balanced for all members on a whole. There is more a sense of balance and completeness on ADTOE that utilizes and maximizes all of the individual members potential, talent, and input. This creates a more satisfying and enjoyable listening experience.     On ADTOE, Dream Theater sounds the most comfortable and inspired, than they have in a long time. Its  definitely their most inspired release since \\"6 degrees\\", and possibly their most well balanced, satisfying, and complete collection of songs in their career.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax released their tenth full length studio album Worship Music in 2011, which was the first album to feature singer Joey Belladonna in 21 years, and their first studio album at all in 8 years.<br /><br />The story behind the album is fairly well discussed; the rumors of Corey Taylor joining the band, the mysterious dismissal of new singer Dan Nelson, the Big Four tour with the Sonishpere Festival etc. In the nineties Anthrax were left in the proverbial wilderness when their record company imploded and it seemed they've been back there again ever since their Alive 2 DVD was released in 2005.<br /><br />You aren't likely to get many impartial opinions on this record. Some people have been clamoring for a new Joey Belladona fronted Anthrax album for over a decade however some people think the band have become irrelevant since parting ways with John Bush, the singer on the four studio albums released since Belladona left, and whichever singer a person prefers is likely to unfairly colour their opinion on the actual record.<br /><br />On its own merits, Worship Music is a good record full of impressive musicianship and songs that don't feel as though you've already heard them before by a thousand other bands. Importantly however, it isn't exactly a return-to-thrash nostalgia record. The music was written before Joey even returned and only tweaked to suit him later, consequently the album feels like a mixture of both Anthrax styles, with songs that they'd never have written with Joey before as well as songs that they'd don't sound like they'd suit John anymore.<br /><br />Half of the tracks, like the initially slow `In The End,' (which is an album highlight) and the eclectic `Judas Priest,' provide the next logical step to We Have Come For You All, and would feel very out of place on any other Belladonna record, yet he makes them his own here on Worship Music and fits the album perfectly. If you came to the album without knowing the history, it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that you couldn't imagine the songs with anyone but Joey, and that is a testament to the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />Of course; at least some of the music is directed at the return-to-form blurbs, such as the pre-released tracks `Fight Em Till You Can't,' and `The Devil You Know,' as well as the very 80s-Anthrax sounding `Giant,' all of which are great Thrash tinged songs that should give you an idea of the direction of the other half of the album. The only thing that seems out of place altogether is a hidden cover of Refused's classic `The New Noise.'<br /><br />Aside from the music, the production is superb. You can imagine that the band had a lot of time in the studio to get it just perfect and it really shows, the band mix all the advancements made in technology with a key understanding of the relationship between the bass guitar and the drumkit that defines the signature 80s Anthrax sound.<br /><br />Overall; Worship Music is a good album that may not be what everybody wanted and that will likely be met with mixed reviews from people who prefer one era of the band to the other. For those who like Anthrax period, who love the way Scott Ian's wrist moves, and the feel of Charlie Benante's kick drum, this is an absolutely great album that you shouldn't hesitate to check out or allow the history behind it to spoil your enjoyment of.'t imagine the songs with anyone but Joey, and that is a testament to the quality of the finished product.

B005974CDU|4.0|The first Dream Theater album without founding member and original drummer Mike Portnoy, A Dramatic Turn of Events will certainly continue to divide the fans, especially those that are extremely upset or pleased by Portnoy's departure. Without getting into that debate, I will just mention that the sound achieved on the album is still unmistakeably Dream Theater with a few minor differences.<br /><br />The album has a great flow to it. The songs are tied together organically exuding some of their freshest ideas in a while. Jordan Rudess, in particular, expands the songs' chordal parameters and no longer strictly functions as Petrucci's shadow, coming to the fore prominently both during the choruses and solo passages. He also avoids using his more eclectic synth patches and tones as he plays to the strength of the compositions. Of course, he is integral in the unison leads of tracks like \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" and \\"Outcry,\\" both of which exceed the ten-minute mark. Rudess also showcases his experimental side: the Tuvan throat singing at the beginning and end of \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" is obviously sampled from Omnisphere as are the gothic-like cathedral-sized 'choirs' and string arrangements.<br /><br />Having recorded the vocals on his own in Canada, James Labrie adds his sonic imprint to some of the tunes much the same way he does on his solo material. Two of the album's ballads, \\"This is the Life\\" and \\"Far from Heaven,\\" both boast majestic piano lines and great melodic segments. There is none of his more aggressive vocalizations present on this disc, though he still exploits his darker tones, as witnessed during the intro of \\"Lost Not Forgotten,\\" arguably his finest moment on the album. Instead of screaming, he builds tension over several notes. This track also eerily recalls the band's majestic track \\"Under a Glass Moon,\\" not in terms of melody construction but arrangement. The band adopts a similar approach to developing the piece using plenty of harmonized fretwork atop a powerful theme introduced in the beginning of the song, which climbs throughout the whole piece until the finale.<br /><br />John Petrucci's playing is surprisingly restrained apart from the whacky instrumental sections the band is known for. Even then, though, his playing takes on a dreamlike quality. Penned by John Myung, \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" is possibly his most emotionally draining guitar solo since the reworked \\"Hollow Years\\" version. It builds slowly, but has a defined purpose and melodic weight to it at the same time. It seems almost improvised, but due to its climax, also painstakingly composed and well arranged. Petrucci's tone here has more definition which heightens the scope a notch, obviously. Simply wonderful.<br /><br />Some may argue that, because Mike Portnoy is out of the band, John Myung's tone is audible and the most central aspect of the album. Well, that assessment cannot be further from the truth. Myung still plays much the way he has on the past releases. Apart from the obvious bass lines here and there (check the album opener or \\"Outcry\\"), he still utilizes deep bass notes rather than extraneous, protruding lines, and this is for a reason. His bass sits in the back in order to create a deeper guitar sound. Petrucci's tone is heavier because of the bass. Myung's playing has never really been about standing out, not since Falling into Infinity at least. They choose to play in each other's sound in order to create a unique sound, just like flutes and oboes, or violins and violas in an orchestra, play unisons without worrying about \\"standing out\\" in the composition. Myung's role within the song is all about establishing additional portals for a tighter rhythmic flow, and he achieves this feat perfectly.<br /><br />Because he joined the band after the songwriting process, new drummer Mike Mangini is given little room to demonstrate his full talents as a drummer. Gone are Portnoy's in-your-face drum parts that dominate a typical Dream Theater album, and this will undoubtedly please or disappoint fans depending on their preferences. As much as Mangini is to be commended for his technical prowess and skill, the drums are mixed too low in the mix and lack some of the additional flair the songs could benefit from. It would have been great if Mangini had created more extreme dynamics within a groove and accentuated the compositions, but he performs more like a session player replicating the intricate lines both rhythmically and melodically. Rather than directing, he is supporting the melodies. His beat construct is pretty standard, which stems from him coming aboard in the last minute. I look forward to the next album with Mangini behind the kit to see how he'll contribute to the band's music.<br /><br />Personally, I feel the mix by Andy Wallace is not the band's best. I don't know how much of that can be attributed to Wallace's not having worked with a progressive metal band before (he is known for his work with modern bands like Atreyu, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, System of a Down, etc.) and I don't understand why the band chose to bring in Wallace when long-time producer Paul Northfield was already available. Also, some songs are mastered too loudly which was not the case on prior Dream Theater albums. Finally, the second track, \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" is atrocious; it is one of the worst Dream Theater songs I have heard. I don't think the blend of industrial sounds, modern-day guitar riffs, gothic-like synths, and Labrie's 'catchy' vocal part works. The band obviously has had other radio-friendly songs in the past, but tracks like \\"Wither\\" and \\"Forsaken\\" are light years better than this one.<br /><br />Without doubt, many reviewers will proclaim this album their best since whatever album they like the most, but these claims will always be debatable, as everything is in the ear of the beholder at the end of the day, and Dream Theater certainly has some of the most \\"demanding\\" fans on the planet.lease or disappoint fans depending on their preferences.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Regardless of how much of a Star Wars fan you (or I) may be, I have to say I'm appalled that there are negative reviews about a product that hasn't EVEN BEEN RELEASED YET. Frankly, there shouldn't be any reviews at all. When you purchase anything, do you write a review before you get it? Lame.
B00005T7I1|4.0|Now here's a movie that needs to be released on Blu-ray, I'd upgrade in a heartbeat.  (And now that Warren is promising a sequel, finally, maybe we'll all get a happy surprise in our Christmas stocking.....please.)<br /><br />The look of this movie is fabulous, dazzling, lavish: it's Piet Mondrian without the white and a little green instead.  This is art.  With Danny Elfman's score its great art.  With Madonna, eh, it's a little less than it could have been with someone who can actually act (I need only point to her sad body of work as an.....ahem......actress to support this claim).  I would have liked it even more had it not been a musical (that seemed rather pointless, all the singing, made even more glaring when they intercut a dance number with the big shootout in the street).  That aside, loved the idea of Michael J. Pollard and Estelle Parsons getting together again with Beatty, if only briefly.  As for those who thought Warren was too old for the role of Dick Tracy, I didn't have any problem accepting him in the part (but I did think he wasn't chiseled enough to look like the hard-edged detective.  Was there a rule that only the bad guys wore extensive makeup?)  And while I think on it, I could have done without Mandy Patinkin squealing out a tune with Madonna.  He's like Wayne Newton on helium (which puts him a notch below fingernails across a chalk board).<br />The best actor of the piece was Charlie (\\"when do we eat?\\") Korsmo as The Kid.  I can't believe he only did 7 movies before giving up on acting.  That's a shame when you consider Madonna did about 20 too many and still hasn't the common sense to give it up.  Oh well.<br />I also don't have a problem with the story being too simplistic.  (I prefer to think of it as uncomplicated, it sounds nicer.)  The plot can be summed up in one sentence: \\"get Tracy!\\"<br />I'd be more than happy to watch the sequel, whenever Warren gets around to making it (he's 74, can he really afford to wait much longer?).<br />At any rate, it's a keeper.....until the Blu-ray comes along.per.....until the Blu-ray comes along.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|First of all i must say that I haven't tried except this device and I'm not aware about the performance of its competitors.    I am a core PC gamer and I have always been pissed off when we gather at my friend's home to play MW2 because no matter how hard i tried the gamepad is simply my #1 enemy. Using this device has turned the tables to my favor and now i'm the one kicking my friend's.... :)    Anyway back to the review, the device needs to be connected to a PC first for buttons configuration. It comes with a CD including an exe file that directly runs the configuration program and automatically detects the Eagle Eye. Setting commands to the keyboard is as easy as 1 2 3. I didn't face any issues nor referred to the help document.    Plugging it into the PS3 it was immediately recognized, no problems at all and the keyboard/mouse were working perfectly.  However i noticed just a tiny fraction of a second lag in response when playing the game, it took me couple of rounds to get used to it and after that i started slaughtering everyone in MW2. This lag is the reason i gave it 4/5 because the documentation claims that this is (hardware) translation not software, so it should do it on the fly without any lag.   Again i must emphasize that the lag is SO tiny, it didn't annoy me at all.    I highly recommend this device for any PC gamer who would like to teach PS3 players some proper shooting ;)    Oh one more thing, do NOT use high end keyboard and mouse, you need to use the cheapest possible keyboard and mouse in the market, otherwise the Eagle Eye will not detect them when plugged to the PS3. And maybe you need a USB extension cable (the Eagle Eye's USB cable is about 6-8 feet long).
0440244412|3.0|I started this series because I kept hearing it was a must read series.  And being a fan of sci-fi, urban fantasy, and PNR I figured there would at least be something there to hold my interest.  Right off the bat I ran into a problem:  I didn't like the heroine MacKayla and wrote a review on the first book saying as much.  I read the reviews of the long time fans that assured new readers she does change.   Sadly, after finishing this series cannot say that I agree.  The basic issues I had with Mac at the beginning of the series were still there for me at the end.     I liked the premise of the series a lot.  I really was interested in finding why Mac's sister was killed and why people were trying to kill or kidnap her.  The secondary characters were interesting, and I liked the lead male character Barrons.  I also liked that the bookstore, Barrons Books & Baubles, was sort of treated like a character all its own.   I thought some of the surprise revelations about various characters were used to good effect.      All that being said, I felt the series should have been a trilogy.  At roughly 2000 pages for the entire hardback collection it's my opinion that the series was bloated and self-indulgent.  Shadowfever clocks in at 594 pages alone.  As with other four books in the series, after a while I just needed quicker  movement in the storyline.  There was a tendency to dwell on one topic, issue, or emotional response for far too long.  I found there to be way too much self-reflection and really long-winded internal dialogue passages.  While I can appreciate that the author wanted to be precise in conveying MacKayla's state of mind some it was redundant and repetitive.  As a sci-fi and urban fantasy reader I'm just used to more tightly written stories where the author gets to the point (no matter how complex) and moves on.      As a conclusion to the series I thought Shadowfever was adequate.  It wrapped up most of the questions that were brought up in the series.  However, I do feel a more concrete explanation of Barrons and his guys could have been given.  As I understand it there will be more books that deal with Christian and Dani stories and couple more Mac & Barrons books.  I'll assume those questions will be addressed then.
B0052WKZZ6|5.0|I saw in Classic Rock magazine the special edition was coming out. I dont usually bother, because the bonus tracks are nusually duds, or (as wuithe previous Mike Oldfield remasters) there like 3 versions of the same album. I have BOXED so dont need the, However, I have been searching for years for Pipe Tune and Wrekodor Rondo. Finally they are on this album. Pipe Tune was a B-side for Cuckoo song and Wreckodor Rondo was off the Take 4 EP. After Ommadawn Incantations is my favourite M.O. album. Very orchestral/choral/pastoral. ANd the best part is that is pretty much based on hose 4 long notes at the beginning of part one. The album is 4 stars as it is maybe a bit long, but gets 5 stars for the aforementioned bonus tracks.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Long before Kirk and Spock were saving the galaxy, Capt. Archer, T'Pol, and the crew of the first Starfleet explorer ship, \\"Enterprise NX-01\\" were meeting new species, and making both friends and foes alike. And Archer was the fist human to save the galaxy.<br /><br />This series goes to show that if they had today's video and FX technology back in the 1960's, the original Star Trek series could have looked a lot different. But \\"Enterprise\\" filled in some of the missing pieces about the beginning of Starfleet, that the original series never touched upon.<br /><br />There were critics that didn't like this series. But the big mistake that most critics make is to try and compare a sequal or spin-off series to the original. Never compare, just enjoy. At least they stuck with the original franchise formula and kept the storylines intact.<br /><br />Star Trek started with the Kirk generation. TNG continued the saga a bit into the future. The Star Trek movie, \\"First Contact\\" showed us how it all started with Cockran's first warp engine and how the Vulcans first met us. Star Trek: Enterprise filled in the blanks between First Contact and the Kirk years. This completed the Star Trek saga.<br /><br />Enterprise had a good 4 year run with lots of excitement. It was cancelled after it's 4th year, but that doesn't mean it was a bad show. It was only seen on the now defunct UPN network which had about 100 viewers, and never had a chance. It would have done much better in syndication as TNG did. Enterprise was a class act with a great cast. If you are a real trekkie like me, you will have a place for this wonderful series on your shelf.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could easily post a long and detailed review but that has been covered many times by the previous reviewers.  The truth about this book is that once you pick it up, you don't want to put it down.  It has all the things you look for in a book, suspense, drama, action, romance (of a sort), intrigue and more.  It also makes you think....<br /><br />I love when an author can do what Suzanne Collins did in this book.  She made you place yourself in the protagonists shoes and think to yourself how you would react in her situations.  What would you do?  I know the story is a bit far-fetched with children being pitted against each other to the death.  But it's a story of a totalitarian society.  Who didn't love \\"V for Vendetta\\"?  The reader has to remember this is a post-apocalyptic style world hundreds of years from our future.  What we hold as values today don't exist then.  But, keeping that in mind the story is wonderfully written.<br /><br />The only con I can think of is I would knock a half a star off for some annoying spelling and grammatical errors that may or may not exist in the print version of the book but do exist in the Kindle version.  They are forgivable however.
0553801473|2.0|As an avid and extremely well read (Even if I say so myself) fantasy fan since the age of 7 yrs (Im now 41), I think I have read more or less everything worth reading in this genre. I came to Georges books late as I didnt want another long @Epic@ fantasy series under my belt - been there done that. I throrughly enjoyed and raced through his first books, but am angry, dissapointed and rather miffed at George after \\"Dance with Dragons, for one of a few reasons; George you are falling into the tv series \\"Lost\\" trap in that you grabbed your readers in your first books but are losing them as you seem to have forgotten rule one of writing novels: A beginning, a middle and an end. I was never so dissatisfied with a fantasy novel as I was with Dragons. Id invested so much time and effort to say at the end \\"Is that it\\". This \\"Tome\\" of a novel goes nowhere, deals with nothing, doesnt answer ANY questions from the other books, and leaves one wholly unhappy....after struggling through such a large book. It really feels like I might not bother with the other 20 books before you start to give us some satisfaction. Also this book suffers from a syndorme that was well described in the film \\"Swordfish\\" when at the beginning of that film John Travolta asks the policeman sitting at the table what if bank robbers in films did start killing hostages? The policeman replies that it wouldnt work. John asks why. Because Its a morality tale, the bad guys must lose and the good guys must win otherwise the readers / watchers go away very upset. Thats how this book made me feel. Total dissapointment. Ill stick with Joe Abercrombie next time.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was a sucker and bought the \\"special edition\\" DVD set back in 2004 when it came out.  After watching those, I realized that I disliked all the changes that Lucas needlessly added in.  I vowed to never buy another Star Wars release again unless it is the original theatrical version and they actually put some effort into making it a high quality release (no lame laserdisc disc non-anamorphic transfer).  The new additions are terrible too.  Darth Vader yelling No Nooooo! made me LOL and Obi-Wan Kenobi's yell sounds likes he just got his lil' lightsaber caught in his zipper.  C'mon George, you are worth over $3 B-B-Billion, do the right thing and listen to the fans that made you all that money.

0060012234|1.0|How this book has one positive review is beyond comprehension.  \\"Geography Club\\" would be a disgrace were it written by a third grader.  It is, perhaps, appropriate for \\"tweens\\" but I found it to be horribly written, preachy, condescending, predictable, completely unrealistic, cliched to a fault and lacking any meaningful character development or plot lines.  F minus, minus.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|True Star Wars fans just as I am are willing to accept the changes.  George Lucas has always felt that Star Wars was never perfect the way it was seen in 1977.  I for once agree with him except for Return Of The Jedi.  I am looking forward to getting this for Christmas since I am a big Star Wars fan.  And on Blu too!!!!!!      As for those wishing for the unaltered versions, his ex wife has original prints of those and they will never see the light of day again.

It was like listening to a 16 year old's fantasy over a playboy magazine.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this movie.  Bad writing (Can you really call it writing if it's just a string of profanity), bad acting, bad directing, overall a horribly bad movie.  Just glad I didn't drop $20 in a theater to see this!  I wouldn't watch this if you paid me.  Don't believe the other reviews.  They have to be paid reviewers.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie!
0307887898|5.0|The Lean Startup was an enjoyable, easy read. That's always worthwhile when reading a \\"business book\\". But it's also important and useful. It's a great refresher (for people familiar with Lean Startup) and a great benchmark (for those that haven't) on startups and building meaningful products.    I'd absolutely reading this book and teasing out the key messages on what's important and what you need to focus on. It's a great framework for being rigorous in your startup development, which most entrepreneurs fail to do.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee has written an incredibly honest, brave book. Having the book written in the first person by Jaycee herself makes you feel like you're actually there with her, living through the fear and trauma of what she went through. It is amazing that she survived the horrors of what she experienced, and equally amazing that she was also brave enough to share her story with us. I applaud Jaycee for her courage, her honesty and her bravery. What an amazing young woman she is. I wish her, her daughters and her family many blessings and much joy as they forge their new lives. Jaycee is an inspiration for us all.
B004L3AQLU|2.0|Neither Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal's  ability to act, nor the the abundance of gratuitous nudity and sex scenes make this mish mash of a movie worth watching.  It doesn't seem to know what it's trying to be; I hated the script, didn't find the comedic aspects amusing (in fact annoying is closer to the mark) and i felt a bit embarrassed for the two main actors lending their chops to such a mess of a film trying to be everything (romcom, drama, raunchy slapstick, etc.) and ending up so lame.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|Ben Affleck's second directorial effort following the critically lauded GONE BABY GONE is a mostly well-executed affair, but a disappointing change of direction in its final act lands it in a predictable, unfeasible, and morally ambiguous conclusion.  In the end, it feels that Affleck and company felt more compelled to capture the mood and feel of their beloved Boston locale, rather then see the riveting story through to what should have been a better conclusion.    The film follows a band of thieves who hold up banks and armored trucks with expert precision.  Following the film's first robbery, Affleck's \\"Doug\\" strikes up a quick relationship with one of the hostages (Rebecca Hall as \\"Claire\\") in an attempt to ensure she doesn't know enough to tip off the feds.  This he does in an effort to prevent his comrade \\"Jem\\" (Jeremy Renner) from simply killing her for safety's sake.  The first half of the film allows the tension to build, as we the audience know that Claire can ID a tell-tale tattoo on Jem's neck if she ever sees it, and that Jem will surely kill her the moment he believes her to be a liability.    The problem I have with the film is that the third act takes the film in an altogether different direction, echoing the similar denouement of HEAT, whereby the thugs chase \\"one last big score,\\" regardless of the feds already nipping at their heels.  This, and the inclusion of another threat from the local drug kingpin that only comes to bear in the final act makes it feel like the script went through re-writes before being committed to film (although it is an adaptation of a novel, so the source material may have followed the same path, I don't know).    Affleck, Renner, and Hall play their roles well, as does Blake Lively as the doped-out sometimes girlfriend and Joe Hamm as the G-man hot on the heels of the thugs.  Affleck's direction is certainly competent, suggesting a possible future with more success behind the camera than in front.  If only the story had stayed on task rather than devolving to the predictable anti-climax, this may have been a much better film.  I never felt the sympathy for the characters that the ending demands.  Many of the decisions by the characters in the final parts of the film felt less honest and more like actions taken to serve the convenience of ending the film arbitrarily.    As it is, the film garnered much critical praise - but one can't help but wonder if this wasn't due more to the surprise to be had in seeing that a veteran actor can also pull off a directorial feat such as this.  Were it a no-name director, the film might have been largely overlooked.    It's certainly not a bad film by any stretch, but some tinkering with the script would have made a better final product.  To see a much better heist film with similar beats, (though lacking the \\"Bah-ston\\" setting) check out Michael Mann's far superior HEAT.
B00003CXB4|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time and it came very quickly. ive watched it almost every night ive had it!
B002T9H2LA|3.0|Trying to capture just why this film disappoints is a truly elusive affair.  Did I have unfair expectations?  Were those expectations set purely by pre-knowledge of the director's previous works?  Was it the fault of the marketing campaign?    Who knows... but the bottom line is, this movie was not what I expected, and I can't say the surprise was a pleasant one.    I will start with this - there wasn't a single scene in this movie that was poorly acted, written, or directed.  The film was brimming with sheer talent on both sides of the camera.  And the final 40 minutes were definitely chock-full of excitement.  The problem, though, is that no matter how well made the parts are, if the final conglomeration falls flat, you still have a disappointing film in the end.      The problem with this movie is simple ... PACE!  I'm coming to believe there are essentially two Tarentinos - the one who engages the audience from start to finish with the sheer energy of what's happening on-screen ... the Tarentino of PULP FICTION, RESERVOIR DOGS, and KILL BILL.  And then there is the Tarentino who loves to hear his characters spout his words, who loves to show how long his actors can sustain a single scene, who loves to draw things out as long as possible - the Tarentino of JACKIE BROWN, DEATHPROOF, and now INGLORIOUS BASTERDS.      The issue is evident in the film's opening scene.  Christopher Walsh, who thoroughly earned his Oscar, is the cold and exacting \\"Jew Hunter\\" of a Nazi who pays a call to a French farm to uncover the Jews he knows are being hidden there.  This sequence begins very intensely - Walsh plays his part almost pleasantly - we wait for that horrible moment when it will go from pleasant to tragic at the drop of a hat.  And then we wait some more ... and keep waiting ... and finally, after 20 full minutes, that hat finally drops.      And the rest of the film follows in this manner.  Tarentino sets up a concept, a plot point, a direction ... and then puts us in front of another soliloquy, or scene-study, or whatever you want to call it that allows his fine actors to rattle on and on and on, while the viewer is increasingly losing interest in the thin set-up.      The sole survivor of the opening scene is led to a point where she will be able to exact full bloody revenge, and once again we are fully engaged.  And then she disappears for nearly 40 minutes so a different set of cast members can play a drunken bar-room game involving guessing which famous person is written on a card stuck to their foreheads!      It isn't until the final 40 minutes that the pace picks up as the film marches towards its bombastic finale (complete with a historical inaccuracy so outrageous, one can picture Tarentino standing just behind the screen flipping the audience a double-bird).  It's as if Tarentino hopes the final act is so over the top with mayhem and delight, that one cannot help but believe they actually sat through an entire film that was so exciting.  But we remember ... we remember how many times we checked our watches to see if we were even CLOSE to the midway point.  We remember shouting at the screen \\"surely these guys aren't going to stop and play a drunken bar game!\\"      And we remember wondering just where in the world the titular Basterds are during the bulk of the film.  For indeed, this movie isn't really about Brad Pitt and his band of merry masochists.  Oh, they figure into it, but only tangentially.  The film is really about seeing how many drawn out acting sequences an audience can endure.  Again, they are all done VERY well - but when put end-to-end...it's just TOO much.  And that's where I come back to the title of my review.  Just as someone needs to tell Lucas \\"enough with the revisions of your one movie!\\"  Just as someone needs to pull M. Night aside and tell him \\"you can't keep remaking the 'twist' ending movie!\\"  Someone needs to tell Tarentino - \\"dude, we know you're a good writer ... stop over-indulging yourself!\\"    With a promising set-up, expert cast, quality writing, and of course the frenetic director, this really should have been a much better film.  As it is, there are many parts worth watching ... just don't expect the riveting pace of Tarentino's better works.  I'd place it above JACKIE BROWN and DEATHPROOF - but only just.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book was a joy, so much 80's flashback retro information that it brought back memories. Great job and if you like games and gaming you will love this book. My only thing I hated was in the first part where the author steps out of his voice to rant about God and evolution. This part is out of place and to stop and rant about something personal is lame... That knocked it down to 4 stars. Thanks and keep them coming.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time, maybe of all time!  I am sad that I have finished reading it... I want more!! This needs to be made into a movie. I don't know what to read next... Going to be hard to top this book.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|It is an elegant watch with superb design. I gifted this watch to my wife on her birthday. I will not call it a men's watch as it has diamonds all around the dial giving it a feminine look. Now a days female loves to wear watches with big dials in different colors. My wife is also one of those who is crazy about watches. I  already knew that she is going to love it. She was amazed to have it. It looks great on her wrist. What she likes the most about the watch is its briliant white color and silver on its side that makes its an ideal watch for every occassion.  Everytime she wears the watch she gets the compliments. Perfect watch for her!!
0142501123|4.0|Wanted everyone to know that I ordered the paperback version in Sept. 2011 and received a copy with the famous 'witch with fries' text.  I don't love this book yet like some, but my daughter is super excited to be a witch for Halloween so I set out to purchase a witch book.  I haven't shared it with her yet.  Maybe her excitment will make the book.
B000KRN67C|5.0|All of Rotting Christ's albums are excellent, but 2007's Theogonia stands out impressively between then and 1997's A Dead Poem. What makes Rotting Christ great is they can sure tear it up in blastbeat fashion, but this is not their main M.O. Instead they stay just above mid pace, and when the moment calls for it, then they get occasionally heavier, and it's this restraint that sets them apart from so many other groups. It's still heavy, but it's also thematic. Theogonia explores their Greek heritage in musical fashion which is something not heard before in their catalog but produces a powerful element of musical ambiance. Also there is instances of Folk cleverly injected in. This album doesn't beat around the bush, maximum impact, heavy as you like it, and takes you on a Greek themed journey that's unforgettable.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Amazon always seemed like a great company, competitive pricing, mostly free shipping, and very thorough reviews, until you try to make a mobile purchase. First off, for some purchases, you need to use their other app, which they very cleverly (clever like a scumbag, mind you) will not let you review, because it is essentially malware. What they don't make very clear is that whether or not you paid to purchase goods from them, you don't possess anything remotely resembling ownership rights in those goods, and Amazon retains the right to take those goods back from you -- that's normally called theft when someone takes from you something that you paid for. What's even worse is that you cannot uninstall the program you used to purchase from Amazon without disabling all the purchases you made through the amazon store. Unless you are comfortable with a useless device (due to the fact that there isn't enough memory to run the appstore, the app you paid for, and all the normal services), you are wasting your time and money by even trying this piece of junk. Someone should take amazon to court over this huge violation of privacy, it would be a slam dunk win, if only because Amazon is clearly violating its own terms of service by allowing Amazon purchased apps to run themselves without permission even after you've removed this horrible Amazon app, yet when you open the app, you can't get in because you are not logged into Amazon. That's right, they are crippling your device even after you attempt to terminate their overbearing contract, in clear violation of their own terms of service. Do not give your money to Amazon, you are not actually buying anything from them, and stay far away from any Amazon apps.

B002NZK5VY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It has humor and romance and manages both with a logical sense of style that really makes the whole thing work.  Too often movies will try so hard to be great but they slip up in one or more categories.  It's annoying to watch a movie that seems to be fantastic only to blow it at the very end by doing something 'cute' but while trying to be cute it breaks the logical consistency it's strove for up to this point.      Two Weeks Notice doesn't do that at all.  It's logical, funny and cute all the way through while at the same time maintaining the sexual tension between Bullock and Grant very well.  There is one scene with Bullock needing to use the restroom and using an RV that stretches the logic a bit but it doesn't go too far.  All in all, great movie.  Great romantic comedy.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is amazing. on Blu Ray it is even better than it was on DVD. this movie is a must have for anybody that owns a blu-ray player, and for anyone that loves Batman
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I saw it in the theaters a couple of times but that's been months so I wanted a refresher.  It's one of those movies where you can tell that the actors and actresses involved had a great bit of fun making the movie.
B000001GPX|3.0|I haven't listened to this performance in quite a while, but let's say I was underwhelmed when it was released, underwhelmed when I replayed it a few years later, a few years after that, and so on...As some of the other detractors have said &#34;I just don't get it&#34;. Maybe it's the failure of expectations, and maybe it's the awful recorded sound. Whatever the case, I just think Kleiber drives the music far too much, doesn't let it breathe, so that you're always conscious of the fact that you're listening to a performance and not the music itself. Now, and here is the real heresy, I guess, I'm much less of a fan of the 5th, so perhaps that colors my view, but I have always adored the 7th, and rarely come across a performance that I can't abide...until this one. Oh, well.   I just purchased the special K2HD Japanese pressing, and the sound is greatly improved. I still don't love these performances but the awful sonics are no longer a distraction. Still, while the 5th still really leaves me cold, the 7th does sound less shrill-not great but better. Not even close to Toscanini, Szell, Monteux or Barenboim (one of his best) in the 5th, and way behind Krips (my favorite) and Monteux in the 7th.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I wouldn't care how much Lucas messed with the films if he ALSO included the *original* theatrical cuts. No sale.
B002CRJWV2|5.0|I can't comment too much beyond what the other 5 star reviewers have stated. This is, for me, along with the Romeo and Juliet overture, the most classically minded of all Tchaikovsky's works. Dorati, who could be prosaic, when he wasn't choosing odd tempi in certain other recordings, nails this music. And the sound is ideal, with great warmth and bottom end. Interestingly, as an aside, when I heard the Kirov play Swan Lake at the Met several years ago, only a week after an ABT performance, I noticed how much cooler, taut and classical their rendition seemed. Maybe Tchaikovsky shouldn't sound so \\"romantic\\" after all. Maybe these suites should be used as a model performance stylistically for his other works. A definite buy.
0385534639|5.0|Set during the turn of the 19th century. Tells the story of Le Cirque de Reves & the competition that is going on between magicians Celia & Marco.  They have been bound and groomed by their instructors to compete in \\"the game\\" against each other.<br /><br />I loved every bit of this story. A wondrous tale. The Night Circus will enchant you with it's richly dark world of mystery and magic.  The intricacy of this story was amazing. From page one I was sucked into Celia & Marco's world. While their instructors probably wished they were great enemies, Celia and Marco felt nothing but respect and love for one other.  I was shocked and excited how much I enjoyed this story. It's definitely one of my favorite books I've read this year. Erin Morgenstern's debut novel is a must read.
B004WMKSH2|1.0|AWFUL, Oh my God, don't rent or buy it. Dreary, not even drama in dialogue. Put me to sleep when I closed my eyes to avoid the low lighting through the whole movie.

0399226907|4.0|This book actually my son, who is 4, read it at school. He loved so much that he kept on reciting the whole story over and over. Nice work.
0060734191|5.0|I must have re-read Lirael and Sabriel 4 times while I waited for Abhorsen to come out, and then all three books became the sort of books you turned to when you can't afford new books but absolutely need to read something amazing. Then, of course, life comes along, you grow up, and you get a job at a bookstore, and that sort of thing isn't as much of a problem.      I tried to put the Abhorsen Trilogy in as many hands as possible when I worked at Borders, but it seemed like Sabriel would always take the longest time to restock (and no one really wants to buy the second book in a series, even when I explained that Lirael and Abhorsen were sort of their own story.), and it was always the best when someone came back for the others.     Yet, I haven't re-read them for a few years.     Feeling sentimental and need some comfort, I've just started with Sabriel again after purchasing the boxset (Abhorsen didn't match the others! It was in hardcover!), and I'm already blown away by how incredible they still are, after all these years and all those other books that I've read. There's a realistic bleakness to the characters and the world, that makes the story that much more powerful.

B000XR4OC0|1.0|I bought Tom's shoes 6 days ago and wore them 3 times, mostly on campus using sidewalks. In that short of time, the canvas began to fray and actually rip away from the heel on both shoes. These are very cheaply made and after paying $45 for a pair, I would expect them to last more than a week. Are the children in Haiti and Argentina running around with ripped Tom's shoes as well? Give these shoes the BOOT and donate money instead.
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is one of those great big stories that takes you into another time and place with characters you'll grow to love.  There were some scenes I wanted to look away from simply because it was hard to accept what was happening to these people I'd grown to care about.  A rich and fulfilling read.  Highly recommended.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Every song is different, but not \\"too\\" different. It's not a mish mash of various unrelatable songs the way some albums can be - it has a good balance of different-ness and sameness in each of the songs to give the album as a whole a very cohesive and interesting sound. There's kind of an 80's synth sound (but better - modern sounding) running through just about all the songs I think (I listen to 1,2,4,7 & 8 a bit more than the others right now). The songs are all catchy and versatile - the cd can be used for dancing, singing, driving in the car or chilling out with a book (I'm one of those people that likes to play music when I read).    I would suggest listening to the cd before you check out lyrics - there not always easy to understand. For instance, song 8 \\"Life On The Nickel\\" - I thought they were saying \\"Oh yeah, I'm awesone\\" over and over. The actual words aren't something I can relate to, but I still love the song the way it sounds. I'll probably still sing it wrong just for the fun of it. I love this cd!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|In the opening scene of the 1942 film classic, Casablanca, we see a plane on final approach into the distressed city's airport. By today's standard it looks like a cardboard cutout dangling from a fishing line. 1933's King Kong portrays stop motion creatures, including those of the title character, whose movements are jerky & clearly artificial. The original Star Trek television series is campy with cheesy props & special effects. And as a movie fan (geek) I can honestly assert that I wouldn't have it any other way. Their inherent deficiencies do nothing to detract from the quality of the films themselves.    That said, I will admit that I was excited about the 'changes' made to the original Star Wars Trilogy when they were RE-released to theaters in 1997. Even though I felt that the Star Wars Saga was great as is, I cheered when each improvement showed up on the big screen. They were new & really looked cool. I totally get what motivated George Lucas to do it. Aside from re-adding those scenes that were made back in the 70s, Lucas was improving the aesthetic image of the films. I saw it as a different type of 'director's cut' editing - if he could have filmed it that way in the 70s he would have, so adding them in later isn't such a big deal. But now, after several more releases, each with more & more changes (to dialogue especially), I am of the opinion, \\"Enough already!\\"     I'm not going to get into whether or not I believe Mr. Lucas can or should alter his works. I'm simply going to state my opinion - I don't like it. Many of the changes have gone beyond a director's cut & improving the aesthetic look of the films. Vader mumbling \\"NO\\" as he vanquishes the Emporer, Luke screaming as he falls down the Cloud City shaft instead of quietly accepting death over the pain of Vader's news, the image of Sebastian Shaw as a redeemed Anakin Skywalker being replaced with Hayden Christensen, they all change my emotional reactions to the films. I'm finding myself rolling my eyes more than raising my eyebrows.     I've had the latest release of Star Wars on Blu-ray on pre-order since it was announce. Yesterday, I canceled that order. For me, the price is no longer worth it. It isn't the same film I once enjoyed in my youth anymore. By no means am I calling this a boycott, rather, a decline to buy a product I feel is of a low, low quality. And I have a feeling that I am not alone in this thinking.

B004GJDQT8|4.0|I've used the Android and iPhone versions of Amazon Mobile.  It has the most important feature down pat - scanning bar codes and looking up products on Amazon.  I've made a quite a few in-store purchases after reading reviews, and I've bought a similar items at Amazon after comparison shopping.    I find the UI somewhat cumbersome.  I'd like to be able to do the following:    1. Scan a bar code from the very first screen when the app opens, instead of clicking on search first and then having to choose how to search.    2. I'd like to be able to search by voice, ala Google's iPhone and Android apps.  Immensely useful.    Under poor network conditions, the app seems particularly slow to update.  Perhaps this is just my hunger for the good quality info I'm looking for from Amazon, and I have less patience than with other apps.    Kudos on the ability to get into my Amazon account, check my orders, etc.  The account interface is very well done.

0553801473|5.0|I read all the books back to back after seeing the show on HBO. I really don't like writing reviews because people need to come to their own conclusions without having someone else's view clouding it. So in saying that i would just like to say that this book was awesome. Maybe i haven't waited 6 years for this book so i wasn't all butt hurt that there wasn't more story progression, but having read them back to back i can say it was epic and made sense and KNOWING their are two more books and the stage is set for all out war in westeros and Slavers Bay i can say im super excited about the coming books.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is great little case. Really has some nice padding and seems to protect everything. I really like the supports that it has. I have not tried putting my tripod as part of it but i am sure that will be fine. I was a little concerned as to where the camera was positioned in the bag and the padding does seem to sag a little where the camera is places. But it seems to keep it safe. I think once I have more things in then it probably won't move around so much.     Well worth the buy.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I had never heard of Adele, never seen her, nor pretended to care about the Grammy/BBC accolades (which I have long since abandoned). So a friend gives me a copy. To this listener, albums are a by-product of over-produced drivel, waste of my time;  I'll take a good song over sex any day. Adele's 21 has some good songs. In a word, refreshing.     Favorite to filler~    Fantastic: Someone like you    Goods: Rolling in the Deep  -Don't you Remember  - Lovesong  - Set Fire to the Rain  - One and Only    On the verge: -Turning Tables  - Rumour has it    (not unlistenable background) Filler: - I'll be waiting  - Take it All  - He Won't Go (easily the worst song on the record)    So... give Adele a chance, her voice is at once impressive and frail; human, which I like.

B004I9TQLI|5.0|\\"The boy in the stripped pajamas\\" was the saddest, most heartbreaking, movie that I have ever seen. Not just because it was an awful thing that happened. (and awful isn't the word to describe it.... nothing can) but to just imagine that this happened to men, women, old, and YOUNG. (All I could picture was my little sons...... and the worst part is, it is all true.    I think that everyone should see this movie. And I am willing to bet that you will walk away with a mixed set of emotions, from anger to sadness, to confusion, to blame, to guilt.    It will leave you speechless, and it will probably leave you with tears in your eyes, but it is worth it.
0307887898|4.0|After years of working with \\"ideas\\" and early stage companies it is great to see Eric put the pieces together and provide a \\"model\\" that should be used by anyone considering a start-up.  Finally!!!!  Build,measure,learn. A plan of discovery to learn what you think you know. Test the business assumptions with real customers and measure each change.  It is not about the team's features and benefits.  It is about the customers and their behaviors AND their money.  Can you build a growth engine?  Finally!!!  Thanks for putting it all in one place and giving pertinent examples.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Being a gamer and having multiple platform I play on, I wanted a headset that could do the same functions across all 3 platforms I play on, (PS3, 360, PC/Mac). The sound quality is pretty good, booming explosions, racketing gunfire, and footsteps creeping up behind you. You can here it all with this headset, a slight hissing noise is the only downside I noticed. There is a \\"control panel\\" that comes as part of the mic's extra long cord allowing you to change all sorts of settings such as the bass and chat levels, and additional features like chat boost. The mic allows you to hear your own voice inside the headset's speakers, so you don't have to guess how well others can hear you, a nice touch. The headset works equally well across all platforms and is a breeze to set up. On everything I tried it on I just plugged the audio in and the USB to a power source on the console and it worked almost immediately. I have used and tested the mic online with my PS3, Xbox 360, and Macbook and it worked great on all three. The cord is very long and seems to be easily tangled, but I bought these knowing that. I would prefer to have a long unruly cord then need to replace batteries all the time. I would suggest these over the Astro A40 Headset any day seeing as these are a fraction of the price just as good. The Astro headset may have better clarity in sound, but only slightly. The PX21 has a much better bass system and the price isn't worth the quality of sound the A40s have.
B005974CDU|2.0|I'm not really into reviewing music, but I've been a long-time Dream Theater fan and I was anticipating any new album.  Unfortunately, I'm not really liking this one much at all.  The music just doesn't have the same creativity or energy that some of their classic albums did.  My favorites are still Scenes from a Memory and Awake.  Lately, it just feels like DT is going through the motions and releasing over-produced, mushy-sounding music, and ADToE is really, to me at least, a continuation of the disappointing Dark Clouds and Silver Linings that I didn't care for.    For me, and again it's just my humble opinion, too much time has been given to Rudess.  They push the drums into the background (and they have almost no snap to them) and I've yet to hear a soaring Petrucci solo that I can sink my teeth into.  Heck, in some of their older stuff even Myung gets in some tasty licks, but this all feels muted and lifeless.      Maybe Portnoy was right that the gang should have taken a bit of a break to renew their creative juices.  I hate to see DT creating music that I see as pretty boring, but I'm afraid that's just where I'm coming from.  I don't have many bands I listen to, unfortunately, but DT has been a staple of mine for a long time.  I guess it's time to see what other bands besides Symphony X, Kamelot, and a few others are taking up DT's mantle for creating raw, daring Progmetal...

The Mac Pro has two PCIe (16x) slots and they normally only use one of the slots for a graphics card.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game is alot of things. I cant really put my finger on it, but I enjoyed the story. It was very different from anything I have read. If you love science fiction, which I do, you will love this book to no end.<br /><br />Some parts, especially leading up to the climax, were super slow. I actually had to go back and read the \\"climax\\" because it came and went so fast.<br /><br />I was really upset that the story revolved around children and the brutality they endure. But then I remember that these children are not to be viewed as such rather they are like adults.
1446301583|1.0|I own several of her books and was looking forward to some fresh ideas. I was mistaken. Many of the same dolls, and very uninspiring bags and purse designs. The  photos of her fabrics being used are lovely, but this book is more about selling her fabric than innovative craft designs.     Sadly Amazon does not accept international returns.
0385732554|3.0|The Giver was a good book. The story captivated me, but something was missing in it. I was always hoping for something more to happen. The book in my opinion was way to short (188 pages). The ending was just horrible. I wanted so bad for the next book to be the continuing story, but it does not. For such a great story I am disappointed that I will not learn was happens to Jonas, the Giver, or the community...<br /><br />I am not one for drawing my own conclusions...
B005974CDU|4.0|Dream Theater return with their highly anticipated new album featuring new drummer Mike Mangini and it is definitely their best album since Octavarium. Dream Theater's last two albums had some good material but also contained lots of boring musical interludes, terrible growling vocals, and silly crowd chants that brought the quality and appeal right down. A Dramatic Turn Of Events sees Dream Theater return to their unique style of melodic rock combined with solid songwriting and awesome musicianship. The entire band sounds great lead by an inspiring vocal performance from James Labrie and the perfect musical fit of Mike Mangini on drums. Mangini's drumming is very solid albeit not as up front in the mix as previous Dream Theater recordings. Highlights include the wicked album opener \\"On The Backs Of Angels\\", the amazing performance of \\"Bridges In The Sky\\", the mesmerising instrumental passages of \\"Outcry\\", and the sweeping epic \\"Breaking All Illusions\\". Despite the fact that A Dramatic Turn Of Events doesn't quite reach the amazing heights set by previous classic Dream Theater albums, it certainly helps to put Dream Theater back where they belong as leaders of the progressive rock genre. In a perfect world Mike Portnoy would make his triumphant return and the next album would be a history making classic....

0307887898|5.0|I've worked with Eric, I've been reading his blog since it launched, and I've seen him speak, so I honestly thought I would not get much out of reading the book. Wrong! The detail and examples in the book make it worth reading, even for those of us who think we already know Lean Startup. But it's especially worth reading for people who are new to the concepts.     In fact, this book is useful to anybody who is trying to create something new. It will help you build great products and companies in an environment of uncertainty. Most importantly, it will help you learn how to innovate in a way that creates things that people really want.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Yet again, the original ORIGINAL Trilogy is omitted from this set in favour of the \\"special\\" edition with even more contemptible changes this time. The climax to the entire saga is ruined when Darth Vader screams \\"NOOOOOO!\\" in the previously silent and very emotional redemption scene. If you saw a clip of this before buying this set, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was an amateur youtube parody, but it's not. There are many more changes than this, but one can look these up with a quick search. All Lucasfilm needs to do is release both versions in the same set and noone will have any complaints. Ridley Scott did it with blade runner, including 4 different cuts of the film.    If people want a decent release, vote with your wallets and don't buy this. If people want to see the kind of updates and restorations that there ought to have been, google 'adywan' and you'll see we've been cheated and sold inferior versions.

0307887898|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have ordered this book before it was available and got a galley copy a few months ago. This is an awesome book introducing you to the foundations of the Lean Startup methodology. Throughout the book Eric Ries uses several case studies from known and unknown tech companies that are using this methodology successfully to try out new ideas and build successful companies and/or products. His primary case study is his own company IMVU which was started after the last dot-com bust. They needed a new technique and methodology to actually build something people wanted, not what the founders thought everyone wanted. It's a great case study on how he developed and used Lean Startup to create a highly successful company that is still going strong today.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into length about what Lean Startup is except for this one little blurb, the Lean Startup methodology is all about understanding and testing your hypotheses about your product or business. We all make certain assumptions about what a product is, how we are going to build it, and who our target market is. Lean Startup helps you get those assumptions out there and validated (or in many cases invalidated).<br /><br />While I do think that \\"The Lean Startup\\" is a great foundational book, I highly recommend pairing it with \\"Running Lean\\" by Ash Maurya as he walks you through, step-by-step, how to implement your own plan. Another good book is [[ASIN:0982743602 The Entrepreneur's Guide to Customer Development: A cheat sheet to The Four Steps to the Epiphany]]\\" which focuses mainly on the customer development section of Lean Startup.
0385534639|5.0|Rival magicians forced into a competition by their unloving fathers, a black and white circus open only at night that delights all the senses, one red-headed twin who sees into the future and one who knows the past, a wide-eyed farm boy who eschews the opportunity to attend Harvard to be part of the Circus, kittens who do back-flips, an ageless contortionist who folds herself into a small, smoke-filled glass box and then disappears.  And, that's just for openers.  This book took my breath away.
B005974CNA|5.0|Dream Theater at their best - take Scenes from a Memory and Images and Words - and you know, where the journey leads - just plain progressive metal with wonderful melodies, great riffs and no a-MUSE-ing ...
B0019UQCHU|4.0|This is not a great album, it is a good album with great guitar.  Wes was just one of those guys with incredible talent and terrible taste in music.  If you are a jazz purist this is a close as Wes gets. otherwise its that easy listening Verve stuff.

B000002I4W|3.0|This is the one with Lonley Woman - a jazz classic.  Ornette's version is the best - much better than the Kronos Quartet.  That is not to say that this album is perfect - far from it, but you could do a lot worse by fishing about in Ornette's back catalog.  My opinion is, you should go to your local library or the internet and see if you like his style before you shell out any of your hard earned cash.  Listening to his music requires \\"suspension of disbelief\\" - belief in melody, harmony, etc.  and is an acquired taste.  But if your curious about Ornette this is a good place to start.  In fact, it is also a good place to finish.
030745455X|5.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\" left me wanting more, more more and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" didn't disappoint. However, \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" is the last book of the trilogy with good reason. All three books are amazing, but \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" delivered the most amazing end possible to the continuing saga of Lisbeth Salander's one-woman war. These were the most intriguing page turners I've read in a long time. In these pages the reader experiences how one woman deals with violence against women, investigative journalism at its best, foreign government and espionage with just enough romance to sweeten the pot. My deep regret is that the author is deceased and I don't have this caliber of fiction to look forward to reading in the future.
1594202710|2.0|I was disappointed with this edition.  It is not the original one.  The book and font size are considerably smaller.  It looks like a book club edition.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was a huge fan of the original trilogy but I doubt I will ever watch them again. The special editions were pointless, the new scenes and background interest looked out of place.  The prequels were appalling, the less said about them the better.  And now George has messed up the bluray release with pointless tinkering.  He won't be getting any more money from me I won't be buying this set.  If you want a vision of the future, imagine George Lucas stamping on the original cuts - forever!
B004I2K4DY|2.0|I accept that I am a biased fan. I've listened to a variety of Les Mis recordings and have seen a few different productions but I have never found anything to be on par with the Tenth Anniversay Concert--titled by fans the, \\"Dream Cast\\". At first, I accepted nothing but that monumental concert, and it greatly inhibited my ability to enjoy other renditions and interpritations. Over the years however, I have learned not to compare everything to the TAC--it's not fair to myself, and it is ultimately unfair to the show, which is still strong today. To anchor it down to a past performance would be wrong, and while I will always use TAC as a basis for comparison, I am now more readily able to take a good show for what it's worth and just accept that nothing will top the mental shrine i've built around the TAC. Naturally, I had high hopes for the 25th concert. Unfortunately, after having watched it a few times and after having contemplated it for a while, I feel as though my expectations were let down. Now, I won't completely degrade this show--there are some performances that are really fantastic--but as a whole, It just doesn't work. But before I delve into the bad, let me highlight the good:    -Alfie Boe. Wilkinson still remains the quintisential Valjean in my mind and his interpritation of the character will never be matched. However, I can appreciate when a good thing comes along, and Boe is more than a good thing: he's fantastic. His operatic voice gives him an edge over some past Valjeans(Wilkinson excluded), and his interpritation of Valjean was so different from Colm's that comparing them seems silly. Boe's Valjean is subdued and humble, and his performance is more subtle. This is a stark constrast to Wilkinson's Valjean, who is vocal and exhuberant without being overworked. In \\"Bring him Home\\", Boe adresses God with humility and without presumption, keeping his composure until the last few moments of the song. Wilkinson's legendary performance of the same song paints a very different portrait: his his outright pleading with God, perhaps seconds away from falling to his knees and begging to save this boy(even if that means that he will have to learn to let his daughter go). What I love about these two is that both paint a believeable character and unlike some other Valjeans, Boe's Valjean is not an attempt at carbon copying the original, which in turn makes his performances very interesting to watch. Colm is still Valjean, but Boe really did a comendable job with this role.   -Ramin Karimloo. It probably goes without saying, but Ramin is fantastic in this show. He brings all of the raw intensity to Enjolras without being too loud or forceful.   -Jenny Galloway. This woman is not praised enough. I was overjoyed to see her, the one and only Mrs.Thenardier in my mind. She hasn't lost a thing, and she really helped carry the show along.  -Lea Salonga. I have mixed opinions about her performance here, which came as a surprise to me because I'm really a big fan of hers. Her performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" in this concert was just too heavy handed to my ears. It was too forced, too loud, and without the subtle intricacies I've heard her handle this song with in different recordings. Her rendition of \\"Come to Me\\" however was superbly done, as was her preformance in the \\"Epilouge\\".   -The 1985 cast reunion. It was nice to see the old pros together again, and I'm amazed at how well some of their voices have aged.  -The Valjean Quartet. Wilkinson made this song. At 67 years old, he was still the most easily distinguishable voice amongst the bunch, with his wonderfully expressive voice. Obviously, his voice isn't as strong as it was. But darn it all if he doesn't sound amazing for his age. It was nicely arranged too, though at times all four voices could be a little over whelming(I think JoJ and Barrowman should have pulled back a bit--they almost sounded like they were shouting).     Now for the \\"half-empty\\" part.    -Norm Lewis. Iknow, I know--some people will curse and shout at me for this. However, I was really dissapointed in Lewis's performance in this concert. I mean, I know the guy can sing. He's done brilliant work in Sweeney Todd and in \\"Sondheim on Sondheim\\". He even rocked \\"The Little Mermaid\\". But as Javert, Lewis just doesn't work. He shouts more than he sings, and it really seemed like Sweeney Todd playing Javert. The character of Javert is perhaps my favorite in all of Les Mis. During the musical, we're supposed to see this character evolve, going from a seemingly apathetic military man to a conflicted soul. There needs to be a progession during all the numbers where we see this change coming about, and Lewis just didn't do this. He was \\"on\\" all the time, and I thought he was going to pop a vein in \\"The Confrontation\\". I like Lewis, but I don't like Lewis in this. I will say to his credit, the musical accompaniment hindered him during some numbers. Which brings me to my next point:  -Musical arrangment and orchestra. It was really off during this show. Sometimes the singer's mikes were too loud and overwhelmed the music, and sometimes the music was too fast or choppy. The music needs to support the voices of the singers, not hinder them. It's sad that for the 25th anniversary of this monumental show that the musical accompaniment wasn't better directed.   -\\"One Day More\\". This is a troublesome song to begin with. If the finale of the number isn't done properly, it sounds like a horrendous cacaphony of mismatched voices. \\"One Day More\\" in this show unfortunately fell into this trap. The beauty of this number has always been that, despite singing different verses, all of the singers somehow blend together. In this show, it was conspiculously obvious that several lyrics were being tossed around and it was dizzying.  -Nick Jonas. I won't hate on Nick Jonas, becasue he was actual better than I expected him to be. I will however hate on the casting director in charge of putting together the singers for this concert. Nick Jonas is often defended as \\"singing well for his age\\" and \\"doing the best he could with what he had\\". Both of these are absolutely true. However, for a 25th anniversary, you can't cast someone in a main role who \\"does the best with their limited voice\\" or \\"sings well for being a pop star\\". The poor kid was terribly outmatched on stage and, while he carried himself through to the best of his abilities, it really hurt the overall production. At times he overacts his character, no doubt trying to make-up for the limits of his voice with a moving performance. Unfortunately, it was so obivously overdone that it just didn't work. The kid isn't a horrendous singer--infact, I think he is a great deal better than any of us familiar with his Jonas Brother's work thought. But \\"being better than bad\\" isn't good enough for what is perhaps the best musical of all time.  -So-so rest of the cast. Samantha Barks wasn't bad, wasn't fantastic. The most mermorable things about her performance is her bizzar phrasing in \\"On My Own\\", a number she overacted in parts where she should have brought her voice back and underacted in parts where she should have given more. The girl can act with her face, but she has yet to master acting with her voice. She's young, and understandably she's not going to be a pro like Lea Salonga. So she was okay, but not great, and I don't she was 25th anniversary great. Similarily, Katie Hall is okay but not great. When discussing this with people who have a more positive opinion of this production, the number one phrase I hear tossed around is, \\"good for their age\\". Yes, Nick Jonas, Samantha Barks, and Katie Hall are all good for their age and yes, there ages are close to the ages of the characters they portray. But in a musical, skill takes precendent over matchign ages. All three of these singers are okay, but nowhere near skilled enough with their acting and vocal techniques to justify their casting in this production.So overall, this was a \\"meh\\" attempt at what should have been a tribute to one of the greatest musical ever written. There were highs and lows, and unfortunately they didn't balance eachother out.
1451629184|4.0|This book is heart-wrenching. It was brave for the author to reveal the sad and graphic details of what she endured during her 18 years of captivity. It was also alarming to learn how miserably the justice system failed. Although the author repeated herself at times, it was still an excellent read. One particularly interesting fact was the relationship Jacee had with her step-father prior to being kidnapped. All parents could benefit from reading this book.

0307887898|5.0|Many of the tech blogs / news blogs that I'm reading are suddenly about deals. financings, IPOs, valuations, and bubbles (or not bubbles). Several years ago, there was a lot more about \\"how to startup a company\\", especially around product, vision, and team. Now a lot of that focus has shifted to deal making and exits.    It was with this backdrop that I read The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. If you don't know Eric, he's the pioneer of the Lean Startup Movement, building on the great work of one of his mentors, Steve Blank who wrote the seminal book The Four Steps to the Epiphany. Both Eric and Steve have must read blogs and Eric's new book will join Steve's as a critical book for any entrepreneur working on a tech startup.    The Lean Startup is focused on the early stages of a company, but applies throughout the lifecycle of any business as all product initiatives, especially new ones, benefit greatly from the Lean Startup approach. We spend a lot of time on this at TechStars and you see a lot of the lean startup principles reflected in the stories in Do More Faster: TechStars Lessons to Accelerate Entrepreneurship.     I've been a fan of Eric's for a number of years ever since I first started reading his blog. We've worked closely together on the Startup Visa Movement and I put him on my short list of people who I'd support in any endeavor that was important to him based on his attitude, vision, deep thinking, and great style and approach to things. I view The Lean Startup as a critical, must read book for every entrepreneur.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|Canceled my order. I just can't bear to watch Han Solo step on Jabba then get away with it and then call him a wonderful human being (or a close approximation). It's a stupid, redundant scene with no new exposition. It looks ugly. And it steals drama from ROTJ. I'm just not going to give George any more money until he edits this stuff out. I don't have to have the absolute originals. I like some of the digital touch-ups. But every single bit of dialog he added since 1997 should be trashed.<br /><br />And one more thing. Why is he continually changing the original trilogy to match the crud he delivered in the prequels. That's just plain dumb. If Star Trek II could survive Kahn's recognizing Checkov who wasn't on the Enterprise when he was, then the original trilogy could have survived the plot holes between it and the prequels.<br /><br />Uggh!
B005E7AOHI|3.0|I got all excited when I heard this album was coming out. There was twinkle in my eye for weeks. I've been a Primus fan forever. I wish this album was as good as I wanted it to be, but with the exception of Lee Van Cleef, these songs just plain do not satisfy. Gone, apparently, are the days of clever little ditties about strange characters. Now we get uninspired songs about politics and television. Sure, Im a little bitter. The album isn't terrible. It's got Les's usual awesome bass playing, Ler's overwhelming charisma on guitar and some surprisingly good and oldschool-sounding drums. The problem, for me, is the songs. I suppose its wrong of me to expect a band to stay the same throughout their career, but I'd kill for more Fries with Cheese, and Soda. It's Primus. That makes it good, but it's not great.

0553386794|5.0|SPOILERS:<br /><br />The first part of A Game of Thrones is a riveting, involving fantasy series; the series takes place in the 7 Kingdoms where turmoil reins as Eddard Stark is asked by his friend and King Robert Baratheon to become \\"Hand of the King\\"--essentially helping him govern the huge, sprawling kingdom that helped Robert win and moving away from the lands he governs. Stark discovers that the king's heir may not be his, sees his son crippled by a rival and finds himself plunged into the intrigue of the crown.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Well written with a large canvas of characters and subplots Martin's first novel in his series of five (to date) has obviously been turned into the popular and well received HBO series but I'd urge fans who watched the series to read the books for themselves. While the series is largely faithful to the novel there are elements that had to be jettisoned (not as many as most film versions mind you)that were dropped, slightly rearranged for the series for continuity purposes.<br /><br />I'd also urge those who watched the series to read the first book before jumping into the second just because of the large amount of characters and the unusual names that Martin uses for some (he also will interchangably refer to some by their nicknames and their characters names which can be confusing for those just jumping into the second novel).<br /><br />Those who are easily offended should be warned however that there are very adult themes examined here and somewhat explicit sex scenes, etc. that would make this inappropriate for younger children (unlike, say \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"The Once and Future King\\" by comparison).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

1569242739|5.0|Making cupcakes with LESS FAT and tastes BETTER than Non-Vegan cupcakes makes sense to me.  Why would you want to do anything other?

B002ZG99N6|4.0|Ben Affleck will be forever identified with two powerful influences on his life:  his friendship with fellow Hollywood demigod Matt Damon and his devotion to the city of Boston.  (You could also add the perils of over-exploiting the Hollywood celebrity machine with J-Lo as another influence, but that would be cruel.)    With \\"The Town,\\" Affleck follows in the footsteps of his friend Damon - is it a coincidence that Hollywood green-lit an Affleck-led Boston crime movie shortly after Damon's performance in \\"The Departed\\"? - by making a terrific cops-and-robbers movie set in Boston.  With \\"The Town,\\" Affleck famously does the heavy lifting of directing, adapting the screenplay from a novel (\\"Prince of Thieves\\"), and starring.  I haven't read the book, but it's safe to say that he did a fine job with at least two of his three roles.    \\"The Town\\" tells the story of a next-generation gang of Boston criminals, led by Doug McCray (Affleck).  His best friend, Jem (James Coughlin), has done nine years hard time after committing a crime to help Doug - think of Jem as a younger Boston-based version of Joe Pesci's various characters.  These guys rob banks and armored cars, and they are good - so good that the FBI is gunning for them.  FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) is on the case, and he's good at his job, too, so fireworks are guaranteed.    The main storyline involves a girl:  the gang hits a bank and in the process may have allowed the assistant bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to see something incriminating . . . and it turns out she lives in their neighborhood in South Boston.  Jem wants to deal with her so that she's guaranteed never to testify, but Doug tries his own tactics.  Doug quickly falls for Claire and is caught in the web of his own deceit.    \\"The Town\\" is aptly named, as all the characters are caught up by the lives they have already lived in South Boston, where everybody seems to be either a criminal or in love with one.  The town forces you to make choices,and those choices have lingering consequences.    Beautifully shot, \\"The Town\\" offers a visual tour of Boston and culminates in a daring shoot-out at Fenway Park.  This is an intelligent piece of filmmaking - we're not talking about \\"Point Break:  Boston\\" here - and the full cast does the story proud.

0880796863|5.0|I was very happy to find this for such a great price! Beautifully packed in a box, with the mini book on Tarot that has 160 pages! For those who are professional readers, this may seem very cheap, I assume. But for the beginner like me, it's perfect to start learning using this deck. Make sure that you clear any negative energy by clearing it before you start using them. There are many different ways to do this, and depending on your belief system.

081297381X|5.0|If you ever read books on probability and likelihood then this is the book for you.    For example he uses a story of a man that flips a coin and bets with two others the probability of it on heads or tails. It comes up with heads every time. One argues it will always be 50/50 so it will have to even out eventually while the other one states that there must be something wrong with the coin for it to only come up on heads for so many times.    Another story he uses which I love compares risk and uncertainty. Risk is if you are playing Russian Roulette by yourself. You know the odds. Uncertainty is when someone else grabs you can does it to you. You have no clue of the odds! Another one states that there is a strong difference between a doctor saying \\"No evidence of cancer\\" and \\"Evidence of non cancer\\". The logical dialectic here is interesting.    The outright concept of a black swan event can be seen in the meltdown of 2008. A number of things deemed not to occur actually did causing a cascading effect. In terms of a good black swan I would say Google and to a degree amazon's kindle apply to it. What was deemed to have one purpose (searching engine, ebook reader) is having a larger impact.    I look forward to reading his other books.
B000T9QF8S|3.0|There is no right or wrong way to play Beethoven. Solti is a respectable conductor and the CSO are on par with any of the world's elite ensembles.  Solti has at least two Beethoven cycles with Chicago, one recorded in the early 1970s (this one), and a later one from the late 1980s.  He also recorded some of the symphonies with the Vienna PO in 1959.<br /><br />Solti's approach to Beethoven is fairly middle of the road.  Tempos are on the brisk side of moderate, though not fast compared to the historically informed crowd.  He doesn't use as much rubato for those who enjoy the start-stop push pull of someone like Furtwangler or Mengelberg.  This sucks some of the drama I enjoy in the 3rd, 5th, and 6th.  On the more `classical' leaning works such as the 1st, 2nd, and 4th, Solti generates a lot of fire.  The 9th gets a blistering performance, and is one of my top shelf readings in modern sound (calling 1972 modern).  An ace ensemble, ringer vocalists and Solti motivated to generate excitement.<br /><br />The 3rd and 5th unfortunately lack gravitas.  While some, like Szell, sacrifice some oomph to highlight the structure, no great rewards await.  With the bar set so high by Walter, Bohm and others in the 6th, this version sounds like a partly cloudy day in the hills, lacking both lyrical sunshine and a bracing storm.  The 7th has a little more heft, though not enough for my tastes (the live Tennstedt is a smoker).  The CSO muscles its way through the 8th, stressing many notes where I prefer some more dancelike lyricism and bounce.<br /><br />Overall a respectable if somewhat uneven cycle.  Some might just prefer to track down the single disc version of the 9th.  [[ASIN:B0000041Y0 Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 / Solti]]

159420229X|5.0|I read this after reading other people's reviews. Those reviews do not do this book justice. The author introduces the reader to the world of mnemonics using his own experience and research. The reader is presented with a historical background, a good story, and plenty of research that imparts an entertaining understanding of memory, competition, and what it is to be human. Truly a good introduction to the world of memory competition that focuses on the how it works rather than a bunch a techniques. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history, neuropathology, or just a good story.
0451232577|3.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors. Correction - he was - when I was younger. Going through this book on an eReader (probably a mistake), and not being able to find time for a continuous session, I found the story to be rather burdensome and not as enjoyable as some of his other books. Ennui set in rather quickly, as I read about little incidents that should have been connected in some way, except that the connection is made 50 or 70 pages later, and lacking a session continuity, it is cumbersome to even try to remember why the connection is important. Paging back and forth is not an easy task on eReaders, especially when the span is tens of pages.    Definitely not my favorite KF book, but there are components that contribute to this sentiment:  - Loaner from the library, with a 14 day DRM license, so the reader is under the gun  - 786 pages long, so the pace is almost already set  - Multiple story-lines from different perspectives, but a grand scheme that unifies everything did not become apparent  - Draws from history of WW I, and ~100 years later, we live in a different world it would seem.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was excited when I first heard about the release of the movies in HD.  Oh how the disappointment set in.

0307887898|5.0|I teach entrepreneurship at the MBA level and have been looking forward to Eric's book for a long time.  I'm delighted with The Lean Startup because it bridges the practicalities involved in the creation of a venture to a framework that everyone can understand.  It tilts the playing field towards the learning process, not the business plan design process, to help entrepreneurs understand how to experiment fruitfully and efficiently.  While you may see this book as creating a new funding model for the Silicon Valley startup, it doesn't.  Instead it creates a new working model for the venture to help make everyone successful, from the entrepreneur to the employee to the investor.  You will find it a valuable book to have on your shelf!  A strong complement to the Steve Blank's book on customer development and Alex Osterwalder's book on business model innovation.
B002JVWR4U|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the season 2 DVD for Dollhouse.  I purchased a used DVD that was suppose to be like new, I believe.  The DVD had a few issues playing at times.  It was not bad enough to try to return the dvd, but it was an annoyance at times.  The series was great and I wish they would have kept making it. Too bad it is off the air.  Now I want to see Tru Calling.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|I've been waiting for this blu-ray for a long time, and to be honest, I was a little disappointed with the transfer. There<br />are white specks of dust that appear quite often, the blacks look muddy, and many shots appear soft, while the rest<br />in the scene are crisp. This was not the way it was on the DVD release. I was really looking forward to an excellent transfer,<br />like that of The Exorcist on blu-ray, simply because all of the more recent films I have on Universal blu-ray look<br />fantastic, and I figured they would take their time in restoring this classic film. Unfortunately, this is not the case.<br /><br />They have also added an extra title credit during the opening credits of the film. It states that it is an MCA Universal<br />release, however I have never seen this title credit on any other release of Halloween 2, and the font is not the same<br />typical 'Halloween' font the rest of the opening credits are in. It immediately threw me off.<br /><br />The deleted scenes in the special features are not in widescreen, they are in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which is unfortunate,<br />because the film itself does a fantastic job of utilizing the 2.35:1 ratio like the original did.<br /><br />Having Terror in the Aisles in quite nice, but I would have preferred to see more Halloween 2 related special features.<br /><br />Overall, I rate the 30th anniversary blu-ray of Halloween 2 as follows:<br />PICTURE : *** / out of *****<br />SOUND: **** / out of *****<br />BONUS FEATURES: **** / out of *****<br /><br />The film itself is a classic sequel, and I am glad to have updated it to blu-ray since I am an avid Halloween fan, even if I was a bit disappointed.
1603425381|5.0|I have now made several scarves using the tips and techniques from this book.  I had never seen a \\"standing stitch\\" and now incorporate it in every color change I make.

0307887898|5.0|The advice in this book is solid, and it has worked so well in practice, at so many companies, that it's impossible to ignore. For a while it came as a surprise that every time it got publicity, whether it was on his blog, at a conference, or now in this book, someone always criticized it as snake oil.    Counter-intuitively, this is because Eric is extremely good at communicating. If you can tell that someone is good at making a case, you're less likely to believe them. It seems like too much of a coincidence for one person to have valuable insight and to be an effective communicator. Just look at all the milk-toast in the self-help section, written by authors so good at telling a story that they've convinced themselves that they're authorities. This book is not such a book.    If the case being made in The Lean Startup seems simple, that's because it is. If it feels too general or too obvious, you're ahead of the curve. I've worked at and talked to many startups, and most of them still don't get it. What Eric has distilled to language so clear it seems obvious is not so obvious when you're in the field, up to your neck in product decisions, metrics, and meetings.
B000066C1N|5.0|If you are a Bryan Adams fan, you will enjoy this CD.  If you saw the movie, way back when, it is a collection of wonderful songs about love and commitment.  You won't be disappointed!
0307887898|5.0|One of the best, most practical books I've read. As an entrepreneur, it can tempting to think that your new venture has all sorts of unique, one-off situations that no one else has ever had to deal with, and that there are no \\"processes\\" worth putting into place; we must instead act instinctively to put out fire after fire. The Lean Startup teaches that there are certain issues that all new businesses have in common, and that there's some science (and even logic) that can be applied to any given situation facing a constrained operator, regardless of the fire that needs putting out. Eric ingeniously pulls out these common threads using hands-on stories that can only come from someone with Eric's wide breadth of experience inside some of the best-known Silicon Valley startups (both successes and failures). While it shouldn't be a surprise that titular \\"entrepreneurs\\" find The Lean Startup lessons useful, I've been surprised how applicable the book is to anyone who works, anyone who has a budget, anyone who has ever wanted to get something done, ever (in other words, anyone).
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I actually don't mind some of the changes to the original movies.  I really don't give a crap who shot first, and adding the little \\"extras\\" digitally (side characters and such), is just more Star Wars for me.  I can also forgive cutting Sebastian Shaw from the ghost scene in favor of Hayden Christensen given that it's such a minor tie up scene (it could be cut as far as I'm concerned). However, the golden rule, if there is one, in any piece of art, is never change the very essence of the work.  The Nooooo! placed in the ROTJ scene is unforgivable for me.  The Noooo from the third prequel was awful scene with nearly zero emotional impact.  However, Darth Vader throwing the emperor down the shaft is one of the best scenes in all the movies, a pivotal moment, (and one of the few good scenes in ROTJ to be honest).  Messing with the quiet tension mixed with the beautiful score playing over Lukes cries in the background is an AWFUL decision.  Maybe they should consider putting George Lucas in an assisted living home, as he's clearly not firing on all cylinders anymore.  I probably won't be buying this unless it ends up in the bargain bin somewhere.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is the simple and beautiful story of the simple and beautiful Mahatma Gandhi. The man whose humility and greatness came from a unique and historically rare realization that violence begets violence. The martyrdom of this man has been lost to our modern world. His life is the antithesis of modern society. So, go watch this masterful restoration on blu-ray and rejoice that a man like this existed and CAN live again, if people would take a good look in the mirror and see where they are going.

141690977X|5.0|\\"He's Just Not That Into You!\\" is an amazing book. It is relatable, which is difficult these days! It is concise, no long-winded answers or solutions; it doesn't give you tips and tricks, it just teaches you how to recognize what is right there already and helps you develop insight into your experiences, those in your past, present and awareness into those in you future.     I loved reading this book! I would refrain from using a pen or a highlighter while reading it, you might end up underlining on every page. This book is a keeper, one I plan on reviewing next time I start making excuses for someone I am dating.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|For the original fans (I was 12) when I saw Star Wars the 1st time this product is another attempt at making Lucas richer and another kick in the face to original fans.All we want as stated before thousands of times around the internet is a proper release of the original theatrical films including all the proper sound tracks not this continuing train wreck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I for one will NO LONGER support the Star Wars franchise and the fiasco it has become. This is a travesty to motion picture in general not honoring the original classic for the LOVE OF MONEY is disgusting. Lucas needs to \\"GET A CLUE\\" and give the original fans what we want plus a future generation of fans and silence the thrones of angry fans. What does the future hold who know but what I do know is Lucas insane never ending tinkering continues and he will not longer get dollar one from me.CGI does not mean better when abused. Good bye and yes the Force is NOT WITH YOU.

B001BP9ZFO|5.0|Average-height Phil Hoffman quickly has us believing he's the diminutive author of [[ASIN:0679745580 IN COLD BLOOD]] in CAPOTE, the story of Truman Capote's agonies to complete the very first true crime novel, one that was originally intended as only a [[ASIN:B001U5SPJW NEW YORKER]] magazine article.<br /><br />Clifton Collins is most convincing as condemned killer Perry Smith, who enters into a relationship with Capote under the strangest of circumstances: within the confines of a jail cell. Smith emotionally manipulates the trusting author into aiding an ultimately futile battle to overturn his death sentence. Only when time is running out for him does Perry reveal to his friend the psychopath that he really is. The effect upon Truman of Smith's graphic confession is as if he were also ascending the gallows stairs. (We learn in postscript that Capote never completed another book after IN COLD BLOOD and that his death was related to long-term alcohol damage.)<br /><br />Kudos also to Catherine Keener's Harper Lee. The author of [[ASIN:0060194995 TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD]] was a close friend of Truman's since childhood. When necessary, she exerts a stabilizing influence upon him and possesses an emotional maturity that seems beyond the reach of flighty Capote.<br /><br />Rural Canada stands in well for Kansas farm country. The filmmakers and cast do an admirable job of recreating a world that's one-half century in the past and telling what is in the end a melancholy story.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.4) Capote (Canada/USA-2005) - Philip Seymour Hoffman/Clifton Collins Jr./Catherine Keener/Chris Cooper/Bruce Greenwood/Mark Pellegrino

B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is a response to the comments that it's useless to rate an unreleased product. I would generally agree except that this product has been released over the course of nearly 35 years. It would be equally fair to comment on a boxed set of a television series which one has seen every episode. Furthermore, the fact that we know what changes have been wrought to the aggregated product from video clips and the inate fluency with which many people can mouth along silently every word of dialogue allows them to reasonably plug them in mentally and compare against prior versions.     What the dwindling legion of stalwarts firmly entrenched in the pro-blu-ray change camp might fail to appreciate, is that the overwhelming criticism go far beyond knee-jerk reactions to rewriting our cherished memories. The changes conflict with and undermine well established rules about story-telling that were simple enough to allow millions of people with divergent experiences and tastes to suspend disbelief and get wrapped up in the film. Star Wars wasn't as big as it is because of Jedis or lightsabers or aliens or fascist enemies or muppets or special effects or cinematography or music or catchy one-liners or drawn out plot elements or the final redemption of the protagonist/antagonist. It was all these combined. It was the things that the Academy saw in it and recognized it as a good film irrespective of the franchise.     The original Star Wars movies were great movies WITHOUT the enthusiasm of fanboys who went to the theater in costumes and staged lightsaber battles in the front row. The Star Wars prequels were not great movies DESPITE the enthusiasm of fanboys who lined up for days to be there opening night. It is by the same metrics that we judge other movies that critics of the blu-ray release base their reaction on. We know these films inside and out, forwards and backwards. The changes over the last fifteen years have reconciled for many people what the difference between a greatmovie and a flash-in-the-pan.     Most of the 1-star reviews are based on known criteria and a track-record of failure by Lucasfilm to meet the demands of so many fans. Manyt of the 5-star reviews (but not all, I'll give credit where it is due) are based on expected enjoyment that won't stand the test of time. It's no surprise, then, that so many 5-star reviews were written soon after the anouncement was made. Bears beat the bulls on this one.     This is stupid. I can't believe I'm so pissed off. I feel like the parent of junkie who struggles to hold out hope. I love Star Wars, but it squandered so much potential on quick-fixes and fast money. I still love a part of it and that love will never die, but until it cleans up his act, no matter how much it knocks at my door and leaves delicious offerings of behind-the-scenes footage or deleted scenes, I will not tolerate its presence in my house. Go somewhere else with your lies and broken promises. You haven't changed. And for all the highs, which I still love you for, they can no longer make up for the disappointment and tears that you bring when you try to peddle your smack 'round here. So go! Get off my porch! If you think you have 5-star friends, well then stay with them. But you'll see. You keep this up and one day you'll wake up feeling empty and completely alone - if you ever wake up.     I've got 5-stars waiting for you, but you have to earn every single one of them.
0061122416|5.0|There's nothing much to add to what's already been said in previous reviews. I'm a lover of good literature and I respect and admire storytellers who are able to reach me at a very personal level through their craft. \\"The Alchemist\\" I read many, many years ago and it has always remained one of my favourites -- I've reread it several times, and now, I encourage my children to read it. Its positive message, stay close to your dream for if you want something badly enough all the forces of the universe will conspire to make it happen, is a message that stays with me always, thanks to Mr. Coelho's success in getting this across in such an effective way through his storytelling. When I first read the novel, the plot reminded me in a general way, of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, \\"The Threefold Destiny\\", another plot of our hero roaming around the world only to return home to find his treasure right there in his old village. \\"The Alchemist\\" of course goes much further than this, and is a compulsively readable, graceful, provocative novel. Having read much of Mr. Coelho's writings, it is typical of the dreamlike quality always present in his novels, written in a style which always makes me feel, when I open one of his books, that I must dream too -- that I must keep my dreams alive.
0553801473|5.0|I love the entires series. I'm very surprised this book didn't get better reviews. I thought Feast of Crows wasn't his best work, just because my favorite characters were in this book, but I loved Dance with Dragons. The only complaint I have is that the books are moving more and more towards being a magic-dominated book. I really liked it when it was all about winning the iron throne. But it's not like we all didn't see this coming. It's been building up to something like this, and it's only going to get more and more like this from here on. The characters are so great that I just don't care about it at this point.<br /><br />When's the next one?

B005FOQDC0|5.0|Lego technic Unimog u400 is certainly the best model for lego's 2011 flagship. The model contains 4 switches. I'll talk about those later in this review. First of all, the unimog u400 Lego technic set has an impressive amount of pieces, and comes in a packed-secure box. This set comes with a m motor, a battery box (8 batteries required), 2 pneumatic cylinders, one small pneumatic cylinder, one pneumatic pump, and 11 air tubes.                                                                                                                                               The features: 4 switches that control the pneumatic pump and a switch that cleverly controls the front and back motorized options that controls the winch, and the crane that can be turned 360 degrees. The crane and the winch can be reversed, so you can place the crane in the front of the machine. This is a great model, and it's really a good deal.
0553801473|4.0|A Dance With Dragons is a long book, a book where many things happen, where many characters are met (again), where many plots are expanded. Yet, it is the fifth book out of a seven book planned saga, and maybe the one so far where the sense of incompleteness is higher. Martin is able to pull the strings of his amazingly wide world, but in some way this world is becoming too crowded and in some twists you can almost smell the attempt to take time in order to let all the pieces fit.<br /><br />On the other side, A Dance With Dragons is George R. R. Martin at his best: amazing descriptions of events and places (not to say food and feasts); a setting that has almost none credibility gap and that continues to grow and to expand as lines go by; characters that navigate their way in the world through greyscales that make judgements almost impossible for the reader; crucial hints about main events or twists hidden between the lines of a description, of a fast-paced dialogue, of a thought by one of the main characters. If I am that much into A Song of Ice and Fire, Martin storytelling abilities is the main reason, and A Dance With Dragons has not let me down.
0439023521|5.0|Months ago I read a book titled The Compound. Fans of that book kept recommending The Hunger Games. I had heard about THG book(s) and kept putting off reading them. Why? I don't know really, possibly because they are YA fiction but I eventually bought the first book thru Amazon and one cold night I sat down to read it. Well, the world just stopped for me, I could not put this book down! Great characters that you find yourself rooting for. If you are a fan of dystopian fiction, you will devour this book and the next two. Trust me, set aside time to properly read these books. In fact by now, I have read all 3 books, at least five times each. Yes, they are that good. Not literary works of art, so if you're the type that will pick apart the grammar or style of writing, then please find another series. Whatever Suzanne Collins hoped to accomplish, she has done so - tenfold. Quite well in fact. Give THG book(s) a chance, I predict you will love these books as much as the rest of us do. And oh by the way, I'm in my 50s, :-) , long past the YA target audience! My favorite characters are Cinna and Peeta. So if a friend or coworker is hounding you to read these books, trust their judgement! Don't delay. Read them before the first movie premieres next March.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|I love the Oceans movies.  This movie made the crew seem like a big family the way they help Reuben get back on his and avenge his name.  It reminds me to not change myself to fit in!
B001N18HOQ|5.0|this set was worth the wait.watching the dvd took me back to where pearl jam began.love it.great stuff.have been a fan since the begining and always will.
B005CZQ9I0|1.0|It's a GOOD thing I did not pay a penny for this schmaltz as I had borrowed it from the library.  I found nothing enjoyable about this album but after a few glasses of wine it fit in perfectly with my dark mood.  The songs sound virtually all the same with the same over produced orchestra grinding away in the background.  There is nothing uplifting in her voice and in fact she sounds tired. If this was a tribute album to her friends, who are gifted songwrters, I would hate to hear what she would dedicate to her enemies.  Afterward I flipped on her album Stoney End and felt a hell of a lot better.  Do NOT buy this album until after you have heard it first after getting it from the library.  Then decide if you want to own this overpriced piece of schlock.
159562015X|4.0|It was really fun to hone in on things that float to the top as my strengths.  It is a refreshing change from being asked to shore up my weaknesses as in other management style personal growth books.
0440244870|5.0|I happened to pick this up at the library, since the title sounded interesting. What a hoot! Apparently this is a genre called \\"chick-lit\\" and I'm far from the target audience (as a 70-year-old gay man). The characters are more caricatures than realistic (I hope!) but the book is full of laugh-out-loud funny passages. Pick it up if you're looking for a mindless couple of hours of entertainment. Very funny!
0711986746|5.0|I love this book and you will too. A must for Freddie and Queen fans. Wish I could meet Peter in person. Thank you Peter for writing. This book and being so sincere and respectful of Freddie Mercury. I believe this is the way it was. Highly recommend this book!!! I bought it at my favorite online store Amazon.com.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|Seldom do you get a story that is truly global.  This book manages to give a good account of society in every part of the continent as it crumbles from the zombie war. What I find very witty is the fact that the accounts are personal and are given after the war. Some are gritty and very emotional. This book will not be for the ones that expect a continuous story with one main hero. Instead you will find a number of normal people that need turns them into heroes or villains or sometimes both. You will find out what would happen in a global crisis to people that are ill prepared, pushed against their will, naive, smart or even scared and ruthless. There is a good detail on government reaction to the war and how arrogance can lead to devastation. The psychological aspect is deep and there are some original ideas about how zombies live and survive.    It has been a good experience reading it although somewhat short as a book. It achieves its goal of being entertaining and informative in a strange way in that it can be applied probably to any global disaster.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|I was skeptical at first to order used items but thought I would give it a try. The item was in excellent condition.  I was very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely order used merchandise again.
B001O7JHSE|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about before I watched it and only ordered it because of the low price on the blu-ray.  Ignore the negative reviews that are coming from a political perspective.  I'm as politically conservative as they come (oops, that'll earn my review an automatic \\"unhelpful\\" rating from the libs, won't it?) and this movie didn't strike me as having any kind of leaning - left or right.  This is a well told story of the moral transformation of one man - nothing more and nothing less.  It's a story of human tragedy and the acting is superb.  It's not any kind of political statement.  It's a great movie.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise, but the buck stops here with George Lucas' adjustment at the end of RotJ. I was willing to overlooking the adjustment to the Han Solo/Greedo encounter, but the Vader change is B-movie garbage. The only thing I am saying \\"Noooooooooooo\\" to is my purchase to this Blu Ray set.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|If you are a sci-fi buff then you will love this movie. It's a bit campy and the \\"acting\\" leaves a bit to be desired but still great.
1455821098|5.0|Two CDs, rather short, but written both from the heart and with deep contemplation.     I felt that Derek was very honest and warm in telling us this journey in his life. It is worth every penny.     Buy this CD if you are looking for a true story of a person who built a successful multi-million dollar business and still stayed true to who he was.

0307887898|5.0|I've been following Eric for some time so I was excited to get a preview copy of this book. I've already made quite a few suggestions to my own coaching clients out of the book. I could start to say \\"if only I had this book 4 years ago when I created my first startup, or later when I opened the second\\" but this book is beyond that. I have a long list of ideas now to remold both of my businesses.<br /><br />Even though you could probably read this whole book on a long flight, it's worth it to stop and spend those hours in it to reduce waste of all sorts in your business.<br /><br />Simply I highly suggest you buy it now and read it as soon as it arrives.
B0059IVV9M|4.0|There is no mistaking the joyous, percolating melodies of Beruit.  The band's songs (primarily the creations of Zach Condon) have been described as pop music with a worldly feel since the songs often feature the sounds of other countries and cultures.  But Condon isn't just showing off his vast array of influences and tastes.  Instead he is marrying them to decidedly American musical genres such as indie-rock to create something unique and meaningful:  music that is vibrant and catchy and succeeds in taking you around the world even though you might not be aware it's happening.<br /><br />The group's latest offering is a tightly focused collection of wide-eyed pop that shows major growth from 2007's \\"The Flying Club Cup\\".  Songs such as \\"Santa Fe\\" and \\"East Harlem\\" burst with melodic richness and a sense of joy and wonder that can only be conveyed by the best pop music.  Yet there is more than just ear candy on display here.  Condon's lyrics display an insightfulness that belies his young age and repeated listens reveal new shadings to the compositions collected here.  This is music for the head, the heart and the ears.<br /><br />Granted, I wish the album had been stretched out just a little bit further.  But I would rather have too little of a very good thing than too much of mere mediocrity.  Condon is well aware of this and wisely leaves listeners wanting more.  If \\"The Riptide\\" is any indication, there will be plenty more to come.
0385534639|5.0|I've read The Night Circus twice, and I can't wait to dive in a third time. Erin Morgenstern has created a world that is so inviting, so imaginative, and so unique, it's amazing that this is her first book. The Night Circus is pure literary escapism for all types of readers--young, old, male, female. There have been lots of comparisons to Harry Potter and Twilight, but this is not a series and not YA (thought it's appropriate for YA readers)--it's completely original and defies comparison. I couldn't recommend it more highly. Prepare to be enchanted!
B0032TORKA|5.0|Finally, I find out why The Golden Compass ended as it did.  There is more to the story than what we think and what we see.  Awesome!!!  A shame they didn't make movies out of the other two.
0812550706|5.0|I adore this book. I've read it who-knows how many times over the years. And every time, it's new and engaging and wonderful. Love the characters, the writing, the subtext. Just a great book.    I'm normally not a sci-fi kind of gal, but this one (and the rest of the series, though the first is still the best) is one of my favorite books. I can't wait until my son is old enough to read it. In fact, I've been considering reading it to him before he goes to bed at night. Though right now (at eight years old), he might be a bit too young for the topics presented. So I'll be patient...and read it to myself again.
B003WTE886|5.0|I don't really listen to country, and never really thought much of Taylor Swift until I watched a music video of her on youtube.  I decided to try this CD and I am completely obsessed.  Her melodies are catchy and don't get boring.  Her lyrics are smart, interesting, and not cheesy.  Her music is fun and inspiring.  She is truly talented and after years of hearing about her but not paying attention, I am finally on board!  This CD is amazing and you'll love it whether you are 9 or 90.

B005BGBPBG|3.0|So..I understand that this is originally a book.  I'd be very curious to know how close to the book the movie is....Here's my review of it.  Let me start with some critiques.<br /><br />(spoiler alert)<br /><br />No matter how beautifully it is portrayed, betrayal in any shape or form is not positively received.  In the movie, the very good girl and the very good guy go behind someone's back in pursuit of their 'true desires.'  I guess as the movie was trying to stay true to the plot of the book, that storyline may have been necessary, but in my personal opinion, the main girl and main guy needs to be liked by the audience for the romance to be heartedly received.  I think the only time when disloyalty is allowed by the main characters is when there is a genuine purpose for that plotline.  So, that was a great disappointment.  Another unnecessary plot was the little surprise with John Krasinski's character towards the end.  There should have been 'some' indication throughout the movie, or the character should've stayed constant until the end.  I realize that life doesn't happen that way, but most of the time, movies happen that way.  The little curve ball with Krasinski was not happily received (by me) and completely redundant to the main plotline.<br /><br />But here are the reasons the movie receives a few stars.  Great cast!  I now would like to declare myself a fan of the actress Ginnifer Goodwin (spelling???)  The adorable, vulnerable, indecisive character of Rachel was very very well portrayed by Ginnifer Goodwin.  She is adorable and sweet and although she is not perceived as beautiful or as perky as Kate Hudson, she has no problems carrying a film.  The actor who plays Dex (his name escapes me) has never been in my radar but did a very convincing job of playing Dex.  Some reviewers have dismissed him to be a bad actor but if they're referring to his awkwardness, I kinda think that was necessary to the character he played.  Kate Hudson - need I say anything else?  She was absolutely perfect for the role and was just way too much fun to watch.  And last but not least, John Krasinski.  He added a nice comedic splash to the film and was absolutely lovely.  I critiqued the twist to the Krasinski's character's plotline but he really made it believable.  I think he is definitely an actor to watch out for.<br /><br />Another plus to the movie is that it is really not your typical romantic comedy.  Although, the sneaking behind the back leaves a bit of sour taste in your mouth, I think that there is enough depth and dimension to the movie that will make it worth your Friday night-in to give this movie a go.lutely perfect for the role and was just way too much fun to watch.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this to throw in my survival pack. I got a few blades so I figured it would be a good idea to have a on the go sharpener. This thing is small. It may not sharpen to a razors edge but it will get a knife back to workng order for survival needs.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Can anyone tell me if this version has subtitles?  I have an earlier version, and while I love the movie, I've reached a point where subtitles are sometimes necessary....      Thank you in advance.
0765348276|5.0|Some people reviewing this book criticize the lack of hard \\"science\\". Not all science fiction has to be lengthy explorations of sophisticated tech paired with epic space opera. Some of the most successful science fiction franchises are anything but plausible. To that end: if you are seeking a novel of complex depth and hardcore believable tech then this is not for you. If you don't take things too seriously, then you may discover a gem. This is simple, rip-roaring fun and that invites you not to take things too seriously.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The link is George's speech about making it illegal to go back and edit movies... So much for \\"preserving art\\" as it was. Why do you hate us so much Mr. Lucas?    *Edit* Link got removed so here's his 1988 speech to Congress  \\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.   I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.    The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.    A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.  People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. Wemust have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.    These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.    I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.  I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.    The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.    There are those whosay American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The Maltese Falcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art, as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities\\"

B000003EUL|1.0|I did not enjoy the Brahms at ALL. It is so strident, forced, rushed, brash, harsh---- those things which are the antithesis of this piece. This is Brahms the bearer of light, of grandeur, of glowing richness, of humor, of lightheartedness! We don't often hear this side of Brahms, and it is a pity that it was lost upon such a pianist as Richter! To be sure,the first movement is dense, but there is none (or very little) of the severity, melancholy or deep maturity of the first Brahms concerto here. Give me Richter's Schubert all the day long, but I much prefer interpretations of this piece which are not so entrenched in the old Russian school.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Falling Skies begins 6 months after an invasion of Earth by aliens from an unknown origin.  It chronicles survivors' struggles to survive and their attempts to fight back the alien incursion.  I've read a lot of criticism of the show as \\"too slow\\".  I think that may be a result of the fact that the actual invasion is not depicted.  This is not a rock-em/sock-em show.  It's not about that.  It's about 300 people trying to figure out how to stay alive (food, water, medical supplies...etc) in a world that no longer functions.  No computers, no fuel injected cars, no TV, no radio.  They have to have runners between groups of people.  At the same time, they have to figure out how to fight back without the technology to which we have become accustomed.      Some people have written that they want to know who the aliens are, where they come from, what they want.  The show focuses on the Mason family.  Some people want more of the characters fleshed out more.  That's all tough to do in 10 episodes.  I say give it a chance.  See what happens next summer.  If I have a complaint about the show, it's that it WAS only 10 episodes.  Most of the \\"summer\\" series are at least 13.  Three more episodes might have given them time to silence some of the criticisms that I have mentioned.  I hope they do more than 10 for next summer.  I have thoroughly enjoyed what I've seen so far.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|This new version of their #1 hits uses the same remasters issued two years ago. Like the original, the first three tracks are in mono. The cardboard package is similar to the remasters only it's two-sided for this album and the booklet is practically identical to the original. The tracks here were chart-toppers in the US and/or UK and give an excellent overview of their extraordinary career even though it only scratches the surface. If you're a new fan, you found a great place to start. If you're a die-hard fan, it's not as essential but is great to have if you like the remasters better.      TT 79:15
B005974CNA|5.0|So Dream Theater return with one of their most anticipated albums to date \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\". This album being their First album since the Departure of their longtime drummer Mike Portnoy. Taking over the drum thrown is the amazing Mike Mangini. Mangini puts on a AMAZING performance on this album! Anyone that feared the quality of Dream Theater's drum playing would go down has nothing to worry about. Mangini's performance is nothing less than amazing on this album. He keeps many beats similar to Portnoy which will make many fans feel at home, but he also add's his own twist to things too. He is incredable..., and frankly i can not see any other drummer taking over the thrown!    Well now onto the songs themselves! I'd say this album is the most well balanced album Dream Theater has released in a while! I pretty much love every Dream Theater album, but something is special about this one. I just can't stop listening to it!  It diffidently has some of the most memorable vocal parts from Labrie for a long time!, and the Lyrics are the best they have written since six degree's... The vocal performance on this album is a HUGE highlight! This album is Very melodically Driven and VERY progressive! It has some of the craziest moments the band has recorded to date! It has the melodic catchy side of image's and words, and awake, mixed with the extreme progressive sides of scenes from a memory with the heavyness of black clouds and silver linings mixed in!, and its done flawlessly! Petrucci's Guitar playing is jaw dropping on this album... His riffs, and leads are so intricate! The Guitar solo's on this album are some of his best. Rudess is also a big highlight on this album! His Keyboard parts sound really fantastic this time around! He has a lot more big orchestral synth parts, more moody. He creates a GREAT atmosphere for the album! He still does his crazy keyboard shred where it counts too! There are some crazy unison leads by Petrucci and Rudess! One of my biggest surprise's on this album is John Myung's bass performance!  He really shines on this album! His tone is great, his lines are so inventive, unique, and technical, and finally he's up in the mix! Myung has kind of been staying in the background for the past few release's, but on this album He really shines!     Im sure there will be many bias listener's that will give the album negative review's just because Portnoy is not on the album, and that's a real shame... I love Portnoy just as much as everyone, but i cant deny what a amazing album this is, and the amazing job Mangini does on drums... If your a Dream Theater fan give the album a listen! it has everything they are known for! Heavyness! Prog! Melody! and feeling!

B005MF1O5S|5.0|Maybe it's filler, maybe it's not!  One thing to remember about Doctor Who is that even the smallest event, no matter how unimportant it seems, could be very important later on.    Examples: Bad Wolf, lost moon of Poosh, the Doctor missing his jacket, etc.    It's silly to answer all the questions at once, it makes things dull!   I guess the \\"filler\\" doesn't bother me as much since I also watch the \\"classic\\" who. (Doctors 1 - 7) Most of those plots only lasted a few episodes, and then they moved on. There was no real meta plots for a season.     At any rate, this is a good episode! It's really enjoyable and it's always fun to see just how wild Amy is. I have to say, she has to be the most patient of all the companions! Well, in regards to waiting for the Doctor that is.     (....I also got a little spooked because the helping hands have the same voice as the Hosts on the Titanic.)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I actually don't remember buying this book. I remember seeing the charge pop up on my credit card and thinking I had better like it, since if it costs more than $0.99, I typically end up getting at the library instead of on kindle.. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. And after staying up until 3am to finish it in one sitting, I got my money's worth by rereading again a few days later.    Abby and Travis are a train wreck. Their relationship is alternates between being fun and endearing to completely co-dependent and dysfunctional, but I still loved every minute of it. The relationship is a rollercoaster from day one, and I spent the whole read waiting for one of them to break - for someone to get hurt, to get arrested, to die, or to get fed up and get off the ride.     Beautiful Disaster perfectly captures that \\"new adult\\" stage in life that fiction seems to skip over, circling around those who have graduated teenagers, but are just getting their feet wet at being adults. The relationship captured between Abby and America (I will admit it - the name 'America' kills me almost as much as the nickname 'Pidgeon') is the epitome of best friends in college - it was fresh and natural and never forced.    The story veers off course with the trip to Las Vegas - I'm not really sure that it added much to the story, it was a catharsis to the relationship, but at the same time, it didn't seem to really `fit' with the rest of the book.     The ending wrapped it up in what some people might consider to be a nice, neat little bow, but I'm hoping the author did it on purpose... Yes, they got their happily ever after, but just like the rest of their relationship, I think it's safe to presume that the new era of their relationship, just like ever stage of their relationship so far, would be nothing more than a disaster.. albeit a beautiful one.

B00001U0DP|5.0|It is over a decade since this tale hit the big screen yet for those of us who saw the film the memory is 'as yesterday'.  I judge films of this kind by the number of tissues needed to get through it.  And for this one you need to enter the theatre with a full box. Roberto Benigni's performance was beyond superlatives and it was no surprise that he picked up the oscar that year.   This isn't a tear jerker, it's a full on assault on the soul. It has to be in every one's top ten films list and if you haven't seen it then this is a must have DVD.

B001UV4XWY|4.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the moral of this movie. If you received a button and if you pushed it, you would get one million dollars but someone you don't know would die, would you do it? The moral of should you choose to kill someone for money is greatly displayed. The movie has two climaxes that are very distant. This movie goes from a thriller to a sci-fi in a very weird way. I didn't like the plot because the movie feels over of forty minutes in. The characters are the Cameron Diaz as Norma Lewis and James Mardsen as Arthur Lewis. Both characters are easy to connect with. Norma is a private school teacher. Arthur works at NASA and is ready to get accepted into the astronaut program. They have one son who question grade school boy. I am going to give the movie just a 2 out of 5 stars because it besides the moral the movie went from a little weird and creepy to nonsense. There isn't any sexual scenes, just some kissing between a married couple. The only cursing is Arthur yelling \\"Jesus Christ\\" several times. Some of the dramatic elements are a little dark and there is a few scenes of shooting and blood. I think the MPAA did a good job with the rating of PG-13 here.

0062060554|2.0|This first novel by S. J. Watson was a disappointment to me. While the plot was intriguing, the story rambled on and on, was very repetitive and left me wondering why I bought this book in the first place. I understand the reason for the way it was written due to the plot. The entire book could have been summed up in a police report in an small town newspaper.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Chances are, if you are already viewing this product, you are already familiar with the show.  If you are already familiar with the show, chances are you are already a huge fan.    As an overly critical and discerning enthusiast of the genre, I am generally not quick on the trigger when it comes to giving my approval to zombie films.  Nonetheless, The Walking Dead is an epic series, masterfully weaving the stereotypical elements one comes to expect from great zombie films with a fresh and surprising, almost giallo-esque focus on the very human side of the characters, often neglected in similar works.  The Walking Dead works almost as a cross-genre series, offering all the gore and action zombie fans expect, while also offering a deeper glimpse into the complex and well-constructed characters as they make their way through an apocalyptic world in which danger is lurking just around the corner at all times.  There is a very personal feel to this series which I find to be a  refreshing take on what has become a rather tired and played-out formula.  If you love zombie films, this series is a must.  If you are not a huge fan of the genre, this series just may be the one that brings you in.  I highly recommend this one.
B0002234LS|3.0|Johnny Depp pulls off a great performance in this thriller. This movie had a pretty neat twist but it was pretty easy to figure out, especially after already watching Fightclub. I enjoyed the way Depp drove the movie and it wasn't as jumpy as I thought. I would give the movie a 2.5 stars of 5. I watched it because my dad borrowed it from a friend. It really didn't seem to stand out from other mystery thrillers I've seen. Depp plays a disturbed writer who has a fan come to his lakefront property claiming that Depp had plagiarized his work. Depp and his ex-wife have a pecular role because she cheated on him but he doesn't want to leave her. The movie is a little disturbing. I would recommend for mature audience.  It does have some graphic images.

0307454541|4.0|I am glad I saw the movie first. It helped me with all the characters in the book and also gave me an idea of the look of the characters in my head while reading and the pronunciation of the Swedish words even the names of the characters.<br />I loved Lisbeth as sad and dark a character as she is I think she is a strong and very smart woman. Also she is a survivor and that's what comes out in her character.<br />Was this a mystery? Yes, I think it was and a good one. I have read better mysteries but the characters drew me into the book as well as the movie.<br />An American version of this book is supposed to me made into a movie and I can't see anyone else playing Lisbeth except the Swedish version right now, but I'm looking forward to the American version and see if the Lisbeth character is as intense as the Swedish movie. I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to hang in there for the first 1/3 of the book until it gets going.

0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries didn't know I was planning my own startup -- but somehow it seemed like he wrote it just for me. It hit the right buttons, and hit them really well. Despite all the other reading, and MBA entrepreneurship classes I have taken in the past, Lean Startup offered a perspective missing from all of them, one that can really be put to use right now, one that builds a smart framework for how to start up strong because you are lean and focused. Lean reduces your own risk and jitters as well as that of potential investors. After advising large companies on newbiz and new products for many years, I can also say, they too should be reading this book.    I read a pre-publication copy of The Lean Startup.    Shira P.

B005974CNA|3.0|I've been a DT fan since back in 92 when Images and Words was released, i was about 17 years old and it was the first CD i had ever gotten. We still had audio tapes back then. ha. So anyways. I think Images remains there best effort to date. The others i would include as being \\"great\\" or even \\"classic\\" would be Awake, Metroplolis Scenes From A Memory, Six Degrees Of Innder Turbulence, Train Of Thought and most of there live material. The albums in between this, and about 2 in the 90's weren't so hot. But thats to be expected with any bands. So what do i think of this CD? Well, first off it's definitely not classic, but it has it's strong and weak moments. In explanation of this, i have been a drummer since around 5 or so, in 2 signed bands, and have pretty much always been a fan of Mike Portnoys playing. So the change with Mike Mangini to me is going to be more obvious than to the average listener, just hearing the tracks for the \\"music\\" itself. First off i think Mangini is really overrated, although he is a very good player. This material was written around him, more so than with him. So i would say the next album (being that we live that long) will be a much better effort.    The strongest points of the record are some of the arrangements, which are beautiful in most cases, thrown together in others. The best track on the record is undoubtably \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\", a tribute to Portnoy? Perhaps. Second would be \\"On The Backs Of Angels\\" of which i like a bit better, it has the most Images and Words vibe to it, especially in the beginning sections of the song. Jame's Labrie does very well, but NEVER busts out in any of the material here. As a matter of fact, i think this is the most restrained i have ever heard him on ANY record DT, or side project. It's not that James can't hit the highs, I just think he's saving it for the tour. Which in any case is good. Also there are even a lot of Hardcore DT fans who dislike Jame's voice, hi or low. I for one have never had aproblem with it. Petrucci and Ruddess shine on many tracks such as \\"Outcry\\" \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" and \\"Bridges In The Sky\\" with dualing solos, the usual manic break downs and even a nice bluesy type solo in the song \\"Breaking All Illusions\\". You won't find the usual speed picking from John, nor anything overly fancy from Rudess. Just the basic DT offtime playing. So it's really nothing we haven't heard before, just a bit more restrained.    So all in all i would call this album just that. Restrained. It does lack energy in a lot of areas, but makes up for it in other areas of the album. You can't expect Mangini to come in to a band who had the same Drummer for 26 years and just go off and blow everyone away. Or i guess he could if they wanted him to. But i guess they felt that wasn't necessary. He does ok, but being a drummer myself, i will always miss Portnoy, and want him in the drummers seat. That to me is DT. I'm glad for Mangini, but sometimes he feels as though he's just going through the motions instead of doing things, you know he could do (better). And last but not least even though these songs are pretty good, (musically), as far as actual \\"catchy\\" choruses, like \\"Pull Me Under\\", \\"The Great Debate\\", \\"This Dying Soul\\" and \\"Lie\\". The only one to really be found is the forementioned \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\". So while the album is good, it's not a classic as i mentioned. I've spun it three times already and have no desire to listen to it (in it's entirety), again. So a good music listen, not so good for songs to stick in your head.
0307887898|5.0|Breaking down entrepreneurship into a science is something that many snake oil salesmen have tried to claim before. But building on the work of Steve Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany, Eric can credibly make that claim. As the data pours in, the lean startup offers a clear advantage to the \\"build it and they will come\\" approach which has led to the death of many a good team. With concrete examples to illustrate concepts such as MVPs, pivots, etc this is a must read for any serious entrepreneur.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|Unfortunately you won't find anything interesting in the extras, there is absolutely nothing of any interest to a true fan.  As much as I respect Lemmy and Billy Corgan it is boring to hear people talking about how great AC/DC are, because the people buying this bluray will already know that.  Surely the original film reels exist and some extra footage added to make this truly special?  Also is it just me or was there some weird sound overdubs?  What was with the voice over at the start?  Was that added in just for this release, unnecessary anyway.  The picture quality is beautiful and saw things in a way I hadn't before.  Love it, but am a little disappointed.  The pictures that came with the collectors addition were pretty crap.  To be honest I wouldn't bother with the collectors addition, and I am a hardcore fan who collects everything I can get my hands on.  Sigh. Yep 5 stars though. At least they haven't gone all George Lucas on it.
0061673730|5.0|Many years ago a chap, who I am glad to report is now my brother-in-law, was prescribed this book as a Stage 1 Engineering pre-read. He took one look at the cover and gave it to me, at that point a pubescent teenager grappling with the existential difficulties of the world which suddenly were presenting themselves (I'm still grappling with them now, come to think of it).<br /><br />\\"Here,\\" he said, \\"you might have more use for this than me\\". He probably meant it as a joke.<br /><br />Well, I had a go - I would guess this was about 1983 - and I still recall Robert M Pirsig's vivid account of the bright, hot sweep of the prairies from the saddle of motorcycle, his ruminations on how to tell if your tappets need realigning, and him rabbiting on about travelling circuses called \\"chautauquas\\" and this mysterious Phaedrus character.<br /><br />I can't have got the whole way through because, as the journey arcs across the midwest to San Francisco, the personal story becomes more intense and the philosophy far more technical than a hormonally confused 13 year old could reasonably have stayed with.<br /><br />Recently I've found a copy and re-read it. Pirsig's fascination with the orient feels a little dated (if not glib) but it's still a clever, original and thought-provoking book, though mostly for the narrative structure rather than the philosophical content.  As we read on we are presented with uncomfortable chapters in Pirsig's history.  We find that Phaedrus is in fact an earlier rendition of Pirsig himself; a child genius and a tenured academic at an early age who, spurred by his own existential search for \\"quality\\", drove himself mad. He had a psychotic episode and was only brought out of it with electro-shock therapy. As we meet him, the rehabilitated Pirsig has left academia, writes technical manuals for IBM (a low-stress job if ever there were one) and has just embarked on a pan-American motorcycle tour with his son, Chris, whom he fears also may have psychiatric issues, and another couple whom he doesn't seem much to like.<br /><br />It is not explained why they are riding across America, other than as a vacation (and as a vacation it sounds super: I've wanted to do the same ever since) yet, as he leaves the other couple behind, it becomes clear that Pirsig is wantonly stirring up some old ghosts as he goes, riding directly into the dark heart of Phaedrus' old life and Chris is his unwitting, and increasingly unwilling, accomplice.<br /><br />Along the way Pirsig engages in these Chautauquas, expounding a theory of \\"quality\\" which, it emerges, is assembled from his fragmented recollections of Phaedrus' own homespun epistemology, once obliterated by the shock treatment but now slowly being uncovered and pieced together as he ventures westward. This is, of course, precisely the philosophy that engulfed and eventually sent Phaedrus insane, so this, with its obvious parallels to pioneering ventures into the wild west, is a powerful literary device.<br /><br />This narrative structure remains fresh; Pirsig's - or perhaps Phaedrus' - philosophy feels a little more shopworn: some of the ground he covers has been fought over bitterly in the subsequent forty years, and while Pirsig's complaints about analytical and Platonic realism ring true, his attempts to cure them with an appeal to a pre-intellectual, undefinable, \\"quality\\" - a valiant attempt, I think, to avoid veering into the roadside ditch of relativism - don't really carry the day (those who have read some of my other reviews will know I don't see a big problem with the roadside ditch). Pirsig's arguments get more strident and technical, but no more compelling, as Phaedrus's personality begins to reassert itself, and as the book enters its last quarter we get into fairly intricate analysis and critique of Plato's dialogues. These have been more lightly dispatched by the likes of Popper and Feyerabend, and Pirsig's alternative (refusing as it does to define its central tenet) lacks any real utility that I could make out.<br /><br />For all this the book never outstays its welcome: Pirsig is canny enough to interleave the philophical musings with the beauty of the American wilderness and an alarming descent towards the psychiatrically unknown.<br /><br />In its erudition, imagination and breath of coverage Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance deserves a place, perhaps further down the rostrum, amongst Philosophy's notably \\"left field\\" classics such as Julian Jaynes' [[ASIN:0618057072 The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]], Paul Feyerabend's [[ASIN:1844674428 Against Method]], and even Friedrich Nietzsche's [[ASIN:1770830871 Thus Spake Zarathustra]].<br /><br />The years have passed: my brother-in-law's eldest son is now currently reading engineering at University. I think I had better return the favour and send him a copy.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonr all this the book never outstays its welcome: Pirsig is canny enough to interleave the philophical musings with the beauty of the American wilderness and an alarming descent towards the psychiatrically unknown.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|It's just one piece of clip on accessory, easy to assemble, no adjustment needed. Accuracy and performance seem to be perfect, I was able to use it with half of the original space required so it's pretty awesome but i played by myself so I don't know how it will work for two players but definitely i can tell it's working and kinect now requires significantly less space.    Taken one star off because the picture taken by the camera has round frame around it, it's tiny but it's not perfect, it's a bit like fish-eye view but I guess it's too much to ask for for a 25 bucks product that does what it's suppose to.

B004J4XGN6|5.0|The first time I heard about lean startups I learned enough to make a few small changes to my last company's process. But that wasn't enough. Even though we had a little bit more hard data, we were still largely a company driven by our own opinion or the opinion's of our loudest customers.    My new company started just as preview copies of The Lean Startup were coming out and it has literally transformed our culture. We work in smaller batches. We validate our hypotheses. That's process that's baked in from the start and that everyone has bought into. The result is that we're so much sharper. Our ideas our informed and then validated. Our features get validated early and then either stick or are removed based on that validation.     The result is that we and our product are much sharper than anything I've ever been part of building before.    Having tried lean at two companies, it's very clear that changing your process is just half of the story. The other half is changing your mindset, and the only way to do that is to hear stories of people who live and breath it every day. Eric's book succeeds wildly in bringing people around to the Lean mindset.     I've bought dozens of copies to have on hand for our future employees--employees that we'd never be in position to hire if not for this book.

As someone who has worked with startups for many years I can tell you it's not only obvious, it's uncommon. Most startups (and big businesses, non-profits, bands, etc) waste way too much time and money discovering they have the wrong product.     I've struggled for years to describe the value of a customer and feedback-centric approach to the startups I work with. Eric makes the case for this approach more cogently than I ever could, describes concrete approaches, and backs it up with example after example. I will be buying a shelf full so I can hand them out to every company that I work with.

B0052WSX32|5.0|Doris Day was one of the most active and certainly most popular stars in show business from the late 1940's into the mid 1970's, the ageless and endearing girl next door whose wholesome image didn't get in the way of a multi-faceted career as a comedienne, dramatic actress, and near-peerless female vocalist.  Since 1975, however, she has made limited public appearances (though by no means a recluse, enjoying her life and friends in Carmel, California) and in 1985 she came out of retirement to film a pet series DORIS DAY'S BEST FRIENDS for cable television.  Each episode of this program features a new vocal performance by the great Doris, singing as beautifully as ever in her early sixties, but these tracks - and programs - disappeared after the show went off the air.  25 years later, twelve of Doris' best performances for the show have finally been released on CD and the result has been a smash hit in England, where the 88-year-old star now has a top ten album with MY HEART.  One wishes this had been released in the States as well but at least we can purchase an import.  There are an additional dozen or so songs that were recorded for the television series so hopefully we will be getting a \\"volume two\\" sometime in the future but for now let's enjoy these songs, extremely well-produced by Doris' late son Terry Melcher (a record producer for decades) and sung by the ever enchanting Doris Day with her \\"heart\\", as always, in her vocals.
0807014273|5.0|A short read, recommended for everyone to read.<br /><br />A concentration camp survivor's tale. Frankl is a psychologist when he's imprisoned and writes the book from the perspective of a scientist. He details the impact of torture on a prisoner's mind: his as well as his comrades. While the book does not avoid the grim reality and fate of Hitler's victims, its strength rides on the tail of its psychological insights and conclusions. Frankl surmises that one's life has meaning, whether one is experiencing happiness or suffering. Most would agree that many people don't have the inner strength or spiritual maturity to grow through such atrocity, let alone survive it.<br /><br />That's why a book like Frankl's is so life affirming, that there were people, in the midst of unthinkable suffering, could still offer their meager chunk of bread to another in need. In this day and age, it's wonderful to see that the human race can rise to such heights while, at the same time, sinking to such depths. There is hope, after all.
B005MHSELS|5.0|Anna Gunn as Skyler shines in this episode.  The guy she used to work for as an accountant shows up, telling her he's got criminal IRS problems.  He cooked the books and the IRS thinks it is on to him.  In a total bravura performance, Skyler turns up at his criminal audit looking like the trashiest broad imaginable. She paints a picture of herself to the IRS as her boss's girlfriend given the job for no other reason.  Left to her own devices, she managed the company's books using the Quicken Program which she considers the most advanced technology on the planet.  The IRS agent looks increasingly pained as this audit continues. The Quicken admission almost gives him a heart attack as this is a big company.<br /><br />On the grimmer side of the story, Jesse and Walt continue to fight over Gus.  Walt wants Gus dead whereas Jesse has gotten used to working with Mike, Gus's henchman, who treats him a lot better than Walt ever has. A wedge is being driven between these two and their united front against Gus unravels. Bryan Cranston (Walt) and Aaron Paul (Jesse) erupt into rage with fists against one another and it is a great sequence, almost like a ballet.<br /><br />Meanwhile Hank is still hot on the case.  One big problem Gus has is that he is simply too clean.  That makes Hank more suspicious, not less.<br /><br />Picture Hank moving in towards Walt and Jesse on one end, Gus moving in on them from the other end, the two of them coming apart at the sames as far as a united front smack dab in the middle--well, it's Shakespeare, isn't it? An epic tragedy continues to unfold and one wonders who will survive it, if anyone.  Hank's rage alone, when he discovers the depths of betrayal towards him, is something I can't wait to see.
0446547603|5.0|My goal is to read all of Nicholas Sparks books. I first read the Notebook that I found in a house we were renting on vacation and could not put it down. That has lead to my desire to read all of Nicholas Sparks books. I loved Safe Haven,it is my favorite of his so far. I have read: The Choice, The Bend in the Road, The Guardian (my 2nd favorite), Nights in Rodanthe, Message in a Bottle (least favorite so far) and obviously the Notebook. The Notebook and Nights in Rodanthe are great stories that make you cry every chapter (practically). I am enjoying the love stories like Safe Haven and The Guardian that add suspense.     This book was not the traditional Nicholas Sparks, but I had dreams about the characters, it was so powerful. Not to give anything away, but the characters are written with such depth (which is what I felt was lacking in the Message in the Bottle - I couldn't connect with either Theresa or Garrett, Theresa was a bit manipulative and Garrett was too emotional). The main character, Katie, in this book, is a wonderful character and relatable. Nicholas Sparks' books just get better and better.     I just purchased three more books of his and will write more reviews.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it's a nice break from the vampire stories that are flooding the market.<br /><br />It's weird without being too weird, and different without being a little out there.  It's believable and gripping.  I'm excited for the next book!
B003UESJEM|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones gives a somber and yet dignified portrayal of executive Gene McClary, the right hand man and best friend of a hardened CEO who has made the calculated  \\"business\\" decision to axe thousands of jobs to boost his company's sagging stock.  Sickened by those around him who seem emotionally detached to the effects the layoffs have on lives and families, McClary wrestles with what to do.<br /><br />Two middle management executives in McClary's division  (Ben Affleck and Chris Cooper) are soon axed as well and each struggles in his own way to bounce back from the loss of the job that they were once so secure in and the devastating effects the layoff has had on their families and their own self esteem.<br /><br />I liked this movie. Tommy Lee Jones' performance was great as I felt his character conflicted over what to do with all the layoffs going on around him while his boss (himself included) continued to enjoy the corporate high life.  On the flip side, it was interesting to see the difference between Ben Affleck and Chris Cooper's characters after they were laid off and confronted with the harsh reality of losing their cushy jobs.  I wondered how each was going to handle their plight and the movie does take a few unexpected twists and turns following them.  Although the movie's message is a bit clich&eacute; in its demonizing of corporations to make a buck no matter what the human cost, the movie was enjoyable and entertaining and captured the unfortunate spirit of American corporate culture as it exists today.

B0055IU4GM|1.0|The NPR stations keep pumping out the \\"Damn This Town\\" cut over & over. After about the 100th forced listen I came to the conclusion I really don't like this song. It's stodgy moving in a slow plodding way, pure musical bulkiness. It doesn't do much at all. It lumbers around like an overweight dinosaur. Also listen to the verse; it's the same exact cookie cutter meter rhythm & pitch found in countless other songs. Does a LEGENDARY songwriter stoop to such plagiaristic means? Generic songwriting is hardly LEGENDARY.    This release is really nothing special & it doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. Rather than see this effort as what it is there seems to be a faction who chooses to glorify John Hiatt from his past efforts & status in the musical realm rather than concentrate on the material contained on this CD. File under nothing special.

0307887898|5.0|I read this book as I begin to think about launching a tech start up and found that it is applicable even to my current job running a nonprofit. The whole idea of A-B testing, while not novel, is applied in a unique and interesting way through micro experiments over a short-term period of time. In nonprofits we normally A-B test - if at all - over the course of months and years when it could easily be done over the period of days and weeks.    The other compelling part to me is the role of vanity metrics and how they lead to making poor decisions. This is endemic in nonprofits and for profits alike and Reis provides a positive frame for identifying and tracking data that truly matters.
0425241505|3.0|Half-human and half-wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful-and passionate-of the Elder races.<br /><br />My Thoughts: When I first saw this book on the new releases page on various sites, I dismissed it right away because of the cover. I know many of the books I read have cheesy cover, but a half naked male on a cover seem so clich&eacute; among paranormal romance novels. I decided to read this book because of all the wonderful reviews it has gotten since its release. I was a little skeptical at first because I never read a dragon book before.<br /><br />The book takes place in New York and follows two main characters Dragos, a dragon wyr one of the top Elder races (one of the strongest paranormal creature) and Pia a half-wyr who becomes entangles in a mess when her ex-boyfriend blackmails her into stealing from Dragos. The book had a good pacing and a lot of action through the entire book. Many people love the dynamic chemistry between the two leads, but I found it somewhat annoying. Pia, struggles to decide if she likes Dragos or not. Throughout the book she states that she likes him and can see goodness in him and other time she says he's a monster. As for Dragos, he comes off really cold-hearted one minute and romantic the next. I also didn't find his whole \\"you're mine\\" attitude endearing. The book explains why he is the way he is, but just reading it was a turn off.<br /><br />Overall it IS a good book, the world building is interesting. Although I may had some problems with the two main characters, I plan on reading the next book because it features two characters from this book who you'll meet; Tricks and Tiago. I think many paranormal romance readers will enjoy this more than me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has exceeded my expectations for the series. I didn't want to put my Kindle down while I was reading it. I would love if Collins made a few books with the Hunger Games theme. My favorite moment in each book is when both Katniss and Peeta realize that they really do love each other. Katniss's story has really brought me closer to myself as a girl and as a lover. One character really did stand out to me. Effie. She reminds me much of my friend.
B002M3SP28|4.0|I have always been facinated by the thought of climbing Mt. Everest and have read several book on various climbs and the men and women that made it to the top of the world.  I have always been aware of the failed Mallory expedition in the 20's but none of the details.  Now I'm not suggesting that this novel is historiclly accurate, I'm sure that Mr. Archer has left out details and added in others to make the story interesting.  Some of the other reviewers seemed to dwell on facts left out and events added in.  Not me, I just enjoyed it for the adventure that it must have been.  I can imagine these guys standing at 27,000 feet in wool, silk and cotton clothes, leather boots and using hemp ropes.  It would be considered a sucide mission by todays standards, and indeed it was.      The story developed well as we saw the main character mature into a man that had a hard time splitting his time between his family and his passion for this mountain.  I didn't think the story slowed at any point and even that I knew the (real) ending, I couldn't wait to get there to see how it happened.  I recommend this book and will continue reading Archer.  In fact, I will be looking for some non-fiction on Mallory as well.    If you are looking into non-fiction accounts of Everest climbs, I recommend these authors:    Reinhold Messner  Jon Krakauer  Anatoli Boukreev  David Breashears
B004VMX5TQ|3.0|There can be no doubting that this is a classic live album.  If you don't know, The Silver Bullet Band were so good in the late 70s/early 80s that they could tear up a storm in any arena.  The music on this is ample evidence and, like Live Bullet, a seminal double live album.    New remasters should make the best possible of releases. But....    On the first cd release fans bemoaned the fact that Let It Rock had been edited down from the 10min 30sec it was on the original vinyl release.  This should have been the time to put it right but Capitol hasn't! It is still the edited version. A star dropped :-(    The bonus track Brave Strangers should also have been placed after We've Got Tonight because, like the studio album, it followed it in most live shows on the tour. Another star dropped for this :-(    What is here is fantastic but is could have been and should have been even better.

030746363X|5.0|I have not been a huge fan of dieting.     Even knowing people who lost 50 pounds in a matter of months with Michel's Montignac diet (which is also a carb-related thing) - I found his food selection principles rather complicated and hard to understand and follow, and what is even worse - breaking even a little thing makes you feel guilty.    Quite contrary, Tim's 4HB is about simplicity and MED (minimum efficient dose). It is all about 80/20 (or 90/10 or even 95/5) principle: you change 20% of your behaviour to reach 80% of results. And this easy to follow guide really works! I was able to \\"get in\\" after reading about 120 pages and eventually lost 40 pounds within 4 months after starting my reading. I must admit that I am not a very strict follower, so I relax and break the rules quite often. And still I am losing more than 2 pounds a week steadily with only 3 minutes of sport weekly (air squats and push-ups on Saturday). No kidding!    What is important though: I am happy about my health condition now, as losing 40 pounds I did not change my feeding habbits so dramatically and I am not taking any drugs or supplements. Here I follow simple rule of thumb: if you see unknown words on the back of the food package - don't buy it. :) (Yes, it well may be that if I would follow everything in Tim's book literally, then I would have lost like 80 pounts in 4 months. But, I am happy with my progress so far and would no like to get under risk by taking things that I don't know.)    OVERALL: I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to refresh their body and life. The 4HB really works and I very grateful to Tim for sharing his experience.    HAPPY READING! BE SLIM, STRONG AND HEALTY!
B004QNN1UI|5.0|I have watched Simply Red twice when they performed in Singapore. The first time was in 1992, when the band was here to promote Stars. And my mouth fell open when Simply Red announced their Farewell Tour in my country scheduled 28 Sept 2010. An iconic live band calling it a day?    At both concerts, Simply Red proved to be skillful at engaging the audience. They would get the crowd warmed up with eight mid tempo numbers. The fast songs will normally follow in quick succession. So by mid-show, the entire stadium would go ballistic and was up on their feet.    Simply Red Farewell Live In Concert At Sydney Opera House brings together two of the world's best known treasures. The show opens with Mick in a speedboat racing towards the venue at sunset. There are plenty of marvelous footage of the Sydney Opera House, the city skyline and the crowd in the Opera House forecourt inserted in-between songs. This DvD captures the spirit of the Simply Red concerts I have attended and is great memorabilia.     The set list for the Farewell shows differs by one to two songs. The Singapore show had So Beautiful and it closed aptly with If You Don't Know Me By Now. I also love that they played my Picture Book favorite Come To My Aid for the DVD and live shows. I'm a little sad though that Say You Love Me was not performed but the DVD set list picks the best from Simply Red's albums over the years.     To sum up. Two icons. One amazing evening. Don't pass this one up.

I also bought \\"Frank\\" after purchasing this item.  Enjoy!
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This movie is the modern day Princess Bride.  It has everything you could want in a fantasy.  A lowly peasant boy who grows into a natural hero.

0553801473|5.0|Read some crazy reviews for this book.  Maybe its cause I just got into the song of ice and fire earlier this year, along with all the other HBO subscribers, and i didnt experience the brutal wait between Feast for Crows and Dance w Dragons but I think alot of the negative comments are unwarranted to say the least.<br />This is as engaging a novel as the rest in the series with as many plot twists and surprises that a Storm of Swords did.  I highly recommend reading the previous installments first and will not comment as to the plot of this book to not ruin it for new readers but it is well written and a beautiful book to boot.  A dance with dragons will not let down but only leave you wanting more and does not delude the intentions of it's progenitor a Game of Thrones like some long series (ie Anne Rice novels).<br />Please take some of the ultra negative reviews with a grain of salt and I find it suspicious to say the least that some of the worst reviews were written by consumers prior to the books release date and loaded with inaccuracies.  For example one post claimed there were 17 rape scenes in the first 100 pages, well I've read the whole ,almost, 1000 pages and I didn't count one.  Sure there are some Tyrion, Tysha flashbacks (Where do whores go?).  But I wouldn't number them past two or three and it's old ground that's long been covered and far from graphic.  Also Westeros is still at war and rape is a real and ever present danger to women highborn and low folk alike, does a character's concern for one's well being or another lost in the grip of memory constitute a gratuitous rape scene?  No, I don't think so.  It's also not fair to gripe about the lack of some ones favorite character in regards to content.  Not enough Arya?  Too bad there was no Daenerys in Feast and I enjoyed that book as well, just not as much as this one.<br />I think most fans will praise and enjoy this installment and the only negative I see is it eventually ends and we must wait forMr. Martin to finish the next one.  With  Which I'm sure he will not disappoint.  Loved it.

0307887898|5.0|This is the best business book I've read in years and is the single most helpful book an entrepreneur can read. Eric Ries makes the book come alive with excellent, real world examples. Ries avers that his work can be applied to any organization - big, small, governmental... I believe him. Ries' advice is concrete and actionable. He advises start-ups to get out of stealth mode as quickly as possible so that they can get real feedback about their products. While that sounds obvious, most entrepreneurs are scared of people stealing their idea. Ries explains why entrepreneurs don't need to worry about that. The book is filled with useful information. It is a must read!

B000SEIK2S|3.0|Three stars means \\"it's OK\\" in Amazon terms. I would rather give Old Man's War one star to balance the giddy five star reviews. I can only assume that the readers that gave it five stars like classic old school science fiction from the 50's and 60's as Old Man's War reads like an old old book. The concepts are old, the science is old and the writing as dry as a very dry thing indeed. I couldn't believe the comparisons drawn with the giants of modern science fiction. One five star reviewer even states that it doesn't compare to something like Frank Herbert's Dune and I agree but if Dune is a five star book then how can this one be. I would like to suggest to Amazon that they change their rating system to one of ten stars like IMDB. It yields a much more accurate rating as there can be discrimination between great books and good books.

0446547603|3.0|While Safe Haven does have a lot of the typical connections that Sparks draws from to create wonderful novels, I felt disconnected from the characters in this one.  As usual, his world is warm and inviting, but for some reason I just couldn't find an emotional tie to draw me in.<br /><br />On a side note, I did find the 'neighbor' to be an interesting character and I did like how she fit into the resolution of the plot.  I would say more, but I'm not going to spoil the best part of the story.
B005974CNA|4.0|One year ago, progressive metal masters Dream Theater would have announced their indefinite hiatus if drummer and de facto leader Mike Portnoy had gotten his way.  Feeling the band had grown tired and stale, he believed time away from the limelight was necessary for rejuvenation.      Portnoy was right on one count; his band was not quite what it used to be.  While recent albums certainly contained some magical moments and garnered the band ever-growing popularity and sales, longtime fans couldn't help but hear the sound of a band on autopilot.  However, this past year has show that Portnoy was fortunately mistaken about the need for a hiatus, as is evidenced by his band mates' defiant decision to instead carry on without him and release their stellar 11th album, A Dramatic Turn of Events.    Perhaps the band owes a debt of gratitude to Portnoy for stepping aside, as they have looked deep within themselves to create their freshest piece of work in a decade.  Gone are the failed attempts at metal vocals (\\"A Nightmare to Remember,\\" \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\"), pedestrian lyrics (\\"The Count of Tuscany\\" - an otherwise brilliant song), and influences worn on sleeves (the Metallica dead-ringer \\"Constant Motion\\" and Muse knock-off \\"Never Enough\\").  Instead, we have Dream Theater sounding like none other than themselves.       And perhaps it can be said that they sometimes sound a little too much like themselves here, as multiple tracks follow eerily similar structures to some of their most beloved songs from 1992's breakthrough Images & Words.  That being said, if ever the members were to look somewhere for inspiration, the majority of fans would likely agree there's no better place than that album.  Opener & lead single \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" harkens back to the band's lone hit \\"Pull Me Under\\" with its clean guitar intro building into a majestic all-band attack and classic prog-metal riffing.  The epic \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" follows the syncopated attack and sweeping solo section \\"Under a Glass Moon,\\" but with a few new twists.  And while \\"Outcry\\" is reminiscent of the classic \\"Metropolis Pt 1\\" in both structure and spirit, it simultaneously sounds modern and fresh.      Two of the album's highlights, however, are completely removed from the aforementioned comparisons.  \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" may very well be the band's best blend yet of prog, metal and unforgettable melody, with a chorus so unbelievable you wish it would happen again despite the song's 11-minute length, while acoustic album-closer \\"Beneath the Surface\\" is an undeniable example of how well the band can shine when holding back.      And then there's the heart-wrenchingly beautiful piano/vocal piece \\"Far From Heaven,\\" which is so good on its own you almost forget it's simply paving the way for what comes next - \\"Breaking All Illusions,\\" a song so near-perfect that it practically overshadows even the best moments of band's past five albums.  Built on the foundation of longtime fan-favorite \\"Learning to Live,\\" \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" ups the ante by taking the former's powerful progressive dynamics and pairing it with a chorus that could serve as the soundtrack to the gates of Heaven opening.  If ever a band could write a \\"classic\\" nearly 25 years into its career, this would be it.      Ironically, the album's weakest points are the two tracks with the most obvious mainstream potential.  \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" nearly falls into clichéd nu-metal riffing before it's saved by a killer chorus, while ballad \\"This is the Life\\" lacks the emotion heard elsewhere in the album's mellower moments (despite stellar guitar work in the intro/outro and solo).      What makes the album work so well on the whole, though, is that Dream Theater sounds like a band again, without anyone being relegated to the backseat.  Guitarist/producer/arguable new leader John Petrucci relies less on driving riffs and focuses more on textures , while keyboardist partner-in-crime Jordan Rudess adds more to the mix sonically here than ever before.  Bassist John Myung remains the least-distinctive, although his playing is undeniable and his first lyrical contribution in 12 years hints at some form of rejuvenation.      Perhaps the most credit, however, must be given to singer James LaBrie and newcomer drummer Mike Mangini.  LaBrie has followed in the footsteps of Geddy Lee by actually sounding better with age, relying more on crafting perfect melodies than hitting big and often unintelligible notes.  And behind the kit, Mangini effortlessly pulls off the difficult task of replacing one of world's leading drummers by fitting in seamlessly with the rest of the band, never quite showing off but subtly letting you know every now and then he's capable of all his predecessor's work and then some.      Ultimately, A Dramatic Turn of Events will surely rank as one of the band's shining moments, perhaps more so with long-time fans yearning of the inspiration behind Images & Words, Awake and Scenes from a Memory than with newer fans bent on the band's more metal-leaning material.
B000O599WG|5.0|Rio Bravo is definitely a great western and a great all-round film of any genre. I can't really say anything that others haven't already stated, so I'll concentrate on the actual DVD releases.<br /><br />At this point I have seen all 3 different DVD releases of Rio Bravo - the standard DVD from around the time that DVDs first came on the scene, the deluxe 2-Disc Special Edition from a few years ago, and the Blu Ray edition. FYI: I project films using a Panasonic PT-AX200U 3 LCD video projector onto a standard white 8ft 8in pull-down screen. I have to say that, without a doubt, the original single disc DVD looks the best, even when projected large.<br /><br />Turns out that for the deluxe 2-Disc special edition, they used the exact same print of the film as for the original DVD and only increased the color saturation. Of course, the color is much more vibrant in the 2-Disc, but it's a fake vibrancy, done merely by adjusting the transfer of the same slightly flawed source used in the first release. The increased saturation causes noticeable loss in detail and naturalness. Dean Martin's skin is almost orange, he looks like he used a spray tan throughout. They added a few extras, one of which is a \\"Making Of\\" featurette. In this \\"Making of,\\" color-wise, the scenes from Rio Bravo that they use are nearly identical in appearance to the original DVD release, proving that the original DVD is actually closer to the look of the original film.<br /><br />The Blu Ray, unfortunately, is the over-saturated transfer from the Two-Disc edition copied onto a Blu Ray disc, and as often happens, this actually causes some transfer issues, so the worst release of all is the blu ray edition. I'm just glad I got the blu ray out of the library and didn't pay for it, because I would have been mad. Don't buy the Blu Ray, buy the 2-disc only if you want the featurettes, and if you really want the best DVD currently available, look for a copy of the first, no-doubt much cheaper, release.<br /><br />All this confirms that it's way past time for an honest-to-goodness restoration & remastering of Rio Bravo.way past time for an honest-to-goodness restoration & remastering of Rio Bravo.

B0058VA2U4|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Jon Bush era of the band. Always thought his straight-forward hard rock vocals were the best fit for Anthrax's music. He even proved that his voice was more than capable of taking their 80's material to the next level as evident by his performance on Greater of Two Evils. Needless to say, I was pretty bummed that he didn't sing on this album. Who Dan Nelson is/was doesnt matter because having a fourth singer would just be rediculous. Furthermore, I always thought Joey's operatic vocals were cheesy, over-the-top, and a little too representative of the bad kinds of hair metal that came from the 80's.<br /><br />However, to all the other fans that prefer Jon Bush, I say give this record a chance. It truly is one of their best ever. Joey's high end vocals have lowered in his older age and is way less operatic. There are still some high pitched nods to his old school style of singing, but he has a hard edge to him that channels Bush in some spots and the material is still a great fit for him. He absolutely tears it up on Devil You Know, In The End, and Fight 'Em Till You Can't. Worship Music is the first time I've loved an album he's been on. Its never too late to impress I suppose.<br /><br />The only gripes I have are the song Crawl, which is way too early 2000's radio hard rock sounding. Pretty bland track. The zinger of the album is their cover of New Noise by Refused. I'm a bit biased, as I love Refused, but the original is not only way out of Anthrax's league vocally (the original is screamed and rightfully so), but its just not a style that suits them and it really makes them sound like a cover band. Anthrax has made some pretty bad decisions with covers in the past (Radiohead?), but this is certainly their worst cover because it deviates from the whole feel of the album. I'll pretend it doesnt exist.<br /><br />Probably the best metal album since Slayer's World Painted Blood so pick up this slab of 80's influenced metal and go nuts. Great return to form for a band rife with line-up turmoil.rife with line-up turmoil.

B005E7AOHI|4.0|While the classic bass grooves you would expect from Les Claypool are present,expect the new batch of Primus songs to be much more experimental in nature. The structure of these songs are less \\"rock\\" and more \\"jam\\", if you know what I mean. My only gripe (and it's a small one), is that I think Les overdid the funk bass effect that was pretty much all over their 2003 EP. It would have been nice to have some more clean tone bass sounds, but he uses that noodley sound all over the place. It should also be noted that Claypool's vocals are drenched in effects and pretty low in the mix throughout the whole album. Its kind of a spacey record in places.<br /><br />The biggest bummer would probably be that Larry LaLonde seems a bit neutered on this record, like he wasn't given much to do. He does his usually tricks and licks, but nothing like the work he did on Frizzle Fry or even Brown album. Jay Lane finally makes his long awaited debut on a Primus record. Pretty wild considering he was their drummer before Herb. He is just as amazing as Herb in my opinion and is a master at hi-hat action<br /><br /> It didn't blow me a way, but I must say this is a fine album from a band I never thought would record again. It certainly blows away Anti-Pop, but I cannot say it's better than Brown Album or Punchbowl. I can't complain about the lyrics being silly because they always have been, hah. Bottom line, this is a great record that is only somewhat similar to their early stuff ( I disagree that this sounds anything like Frizzle Fry). If you like the more experimental side of the band like what you heard on the 2003 EP, then this will be a great addition to your collection.<br /><br />Fun album.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax is back and in a huge way.  What a huge, Huge, HUGE return to form for Anthrax.  This album could have come after Persistance of Time.  The songs are dynamic with plenty of plateaus and huge choruses that made Anthrax so awesome 'back in the day'.  I've been a fan since Spreading the Disease and remained a fan during the \\"Bush\\" years.  They lost something during the time between Sound of White noise and WCFYA though.  It was like the wind got knocked out of their sails a bit.... well, that wind is blowing FULL FORCE now.  WCFYA was a great Anthrax album...but Worship Music is an AMAZING Anthrax album. Glad to hear Joey again as well!
B00081MUY0|5.0|In late 1965 on the heels of two successful UK folk albums released, Donovan was forced to take a \\"break\\" in his career through a good part of 1966 while two record companies disputed contract rights for his next album.  During this hiatus Donovan vacationed in Greece, toured the USA (befriending The Mamas & The Papas and the early Jefferson Airplane), and then back to London where he befriended The Beatles and even assisted Paul McCartney with the lyrics to Yellow Submarine.  All the while of course Donovan was writing songs and he and fellow Beatles were about to unleash psychedelia upon the planet, first in the form of REVOLVER and then with Donovan's own SUNSHINE SUPERMAN, the first true \\"hippy\\" album.  The EMI remastering packages of SUNSHINE SUPERMAN, MELLOW YELLOW, HURDY GURDY MAN, and BARABAJAGAL have re-released four classic Donovan albums with extensive booklets containing a huge amount of information, and these albums are chocked full of previously unreleased material, singles not available on albums and outstanding demo versions.  Reading the booklets actually dispels a lot of misinformation previously assumed and attributed to Donovan erroneously.  For instance, often painted as a follower rather than a leader, the actual reality of the situation was that SUNSHINE SUPERMAN was indeed the first psychedelic album, we just did not know it due to the lock out situation between two feuding record companies that delayed the release of this album and MELLOW YELLOW, both of which were pretty much completed before the legal actions were resolved.  The same applies to his earlier being dubbed a \\"Dylan Clone\\" when nearly every artist in the UK at the time was heavily influenced by the folk movement in America.  CATCH THE WIND and A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN will complete your Donovan 60's collection.  Both of these released under small independent labels have not been improved upon by EMI, however their remastering and release in conjunction with the four EMI releases will make you a near complete collection of the Troubadour's music as it was heaped upon our plates during a time of social revolution.  Donovan was a leader, make no mistake about it, he was a pioneer in the music of the turbulent 60's and rather than a revolutionary, Donovan was a peacemaker.<br /><br />Another misconception is rampant all over the internet and included in many \\"authoritative\\" books and articles on the subject.  The Fat Angel is not about Mama Cass although she did have a modicum of influence in the subject matter, being with Donovan in LA when the \\"light\\" was shone upon his brain, but rather make note that The Fat Angel was a \\"he\\" just as depicted in the song and he was an LA dealer who spun his web about the canyons on a silver bicycle.  And yes Donovan can be heard near the end of the song whispering \\"Cass\\" as the two were very good friends and Donovan just loves to drop names into his songs (ie. The Trip, which is actually about an LA bar named The Trip was a popular high-profile hangout and Donovan name-checks Dylan and Baez outright as well as others more mysteriously).  The Fat Angel name-checks Jefferson Airplane at a time before the group had any following outside of the San Francisco scene.<br /><br />Sunshine Superman, the song, was originally named \\"For John and Paul\\" and upon further inspection one can discern some very subtle new vibrations from the song just by being armed with that new knowledge.  The song had nothing to do with the fact that at an outdoor venue concert Donovan called for his fans to concentrate real hard and that the rain would disappear!  That event actually happened well after the song was recorded and Donovan had no mystical aspirations, only the good fortune of being able to see that the clouds were breaking up behind the audience.  Sunshine Superman, surprisingly when it was released on album had no credits beyond the album band personnel.  These new remastered releases now credit electric guitar onthe song to none other than Jimmy Page.<br /><br />SUNSHINE SUPERMAN was not only the first overtly psychedelic album, but it also was a perfect reflection of \\"Swinging London\\" at the time of its release and inadvertently made Donovan the spokesman for the happening lifestyle.  It was a youth-oriented culture taking hold in the city, colorful, eclectic, and ostentatious.  Fashion and photography gave rise to the world's first supermodels.  Miniskirts began here as well as the future reign of designer Mary Quant.  Television was spirited with The Avengers, and pop/folk music began to score television and film.  London was awash in the music of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Who, Small Faces, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and Pink Floyd, all being broadcast from floating \\"pirate radio\\" as depicted in the recent film of the same name.<br /><br />Donovan had now gone from sparse folk recording to a full rock band, expanding his instrumentation with harpsichords, sitars, saxophone, oboe, tablas, congas and drums, and fully enveloping a \\"flower power\\" uplifting feel.  When he did venture into the folk realm it was more in the vein of the madrigal line of Renaissance and Pentangle.  Legend Of A Girl Child Linda and Guinevere were prime examples of this on this album.  Donovan was fusing rock, jazz, folk, blues, and eastern (Indian) music into a musical palate from which he would draw through 1969.<br /><br />In addition to the electrical title track, The Trip and Season Of The Witch solidified the fact that Donovan had arrived in the rock scene.  The remaster is High Fidelity mono for the album tracks, as they were originally released.  Bonus material includes the longer stereo version of Sunshine Superman (which was re-recorded for The Greatest Hits album) as well as The Land Of Doesn't Have To Be, a completely different version than is known from A GIFT...  A prototype version of Superlungs My Supergirl demonstrates the early experimentation that Donovon would consider when writing songs (this is the first of three versions of the song compiled on the collection, the final version ending up on BARABAJAGAL), and a jazzy version of Museum does so as well.  Note that most of the songs from SUNSHINE SUPERMAN and MELLOW YELLOW were never mixed into stereo and only the new 2011 reissue of this CD has used the same technology that was used on the The Beatles early albums to transform them into stereo.  This particular (2005) reissue is true to the original Hi-Fi release and those of us who remember Season Of The Witch in stereo only got that after the 1969 release of DONOVAN'S GREATEST HITS where Catch The Wind, and Colours were re-recorded into stereo with more flourishes, and Sunshine Superman and Season Of The Witch were remixed using early technology into stereo (as well as Epistle To Dippy, unfortunately Mellow Yellow was the only song not remixed in '69 into stereo for the greatest hits album).<br /><br />SUNSHINE SUPERMAN was the definitive hippy album of an era, more so than anything released by The Beatles, The Dead, The Airplane, or any of the myriad of the San Francisco scene.  In terms of ear-candy, self-indulgent guilty pleasures, only one album outshines this one: IF YOU CAN BELIEVE YOUR EYES AND EARS by The Mamas & The Papas provides the happiest carefree music there is, but SUNSHINE SUPERMAN is a close second.  Even The Beatles REVOLVER fell in behind these two in terms of trippy-ness and Donovan would frolic through the end of the 60's from here.

B0000AMRJC|3.0|Viewed: 3/05, 3/06, 9/11<br />Rate: 5<br /><br />3/06: Sometimes awesome, sometimes mediocre, sometimes annoying, sometimes pointless, sometimes derivative, and mostly lost. Guaranteed, Scarface is an Al Pacino's picture. There are some great acting performances: Robert Loggia, Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, and Paul Shenar. But one very disappointing performance clearly goes to Michelle Pfeiffer who had no business being in that picture. I wish the story would have been constructed a lot better, given that it's from Oliver Stone, with a wishful helping hand from Francis Ford Coppola and/or Mario Puzio, perhaps Martin Scorsese. There is a point where Tony Montana was facing his own demise, but the problem is: what reason contributed to that? Also, I didn't see any more men beyond the bodyguards working for Tony Montana, let alone Frank Lopez. I need more depth in the story and in the development of the empire that Tony Montana had gained control of during his ascent to the top. Sadly, the picture robbed me of that. I really do hate being cheated by Brian De Palma, who is a somewhat gifted filmmaker, but his biggest problem is putting every aspect possible of the movie and making it all to work fluidly together. Pictures he had done come out so short of one thing or two each time: the wrong cast, the annoying camera movements, the falling-apart story, not enough developments, and so on. That's why he couldn't be revered in the same way as Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. Talent is there, but completeness, no. Scarface is more of a cult film than of a serious film. One great thing about Scarface is the conversations in the car, which are shot superbly well. All in all, Scarface is a mess of a film.<br /><br />9/11: Scarface was a ridiculous movie when it first premiered in 1983. Since then, it has steadily gained a lot of steam as being a more appreciated film to the point of achieving its cult status. Now, Scarface remains a very overrated flick. It's easily one of the most ridiculous mess of a spectacle. Personally, I found it to be one of the best comedies I've ever seen until it pretty much fell apart after two hours of mumbo jumbo. Two things are granted. One, Al Pacino makes a remarkable transformation from the days of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Godfather to this obscenely overacted performer that is Tony Montana. It's actually a fine performance, I have to say, despite the mess. Two, the cinematography is excellent throughout that keeps the film interesting to look at. I really enjoy the style, and of course, Brian De Palma is an expert in this area, as always. Naturally, Miami Vice the television show would soon later come and make an indelible mark on Miami. There is also a very, very similar but better stylized film called Manhunter that would rival Scarface for aesthetic quality, and the former wins the contest hands down. Let's go back to the mess, and analyze it a bit for a minute. The plot has the audience, believing that some immigrant from Cuba with obvious criminal past yet with zero connections can rise from the gutters to drug lord of Miami within mere months. Then, it all comes crashing down because he can't control his coke problem. So, the ending has to be done with a bang via Sam Peckinpah route. Looking at the cast, although young and just started out, sometimes I wonder if everybody is saying, \\"Are the director and the writer out of their minds?\\" repeatedly over and over throughout the filming. By looking at the end result, it sure looks like it. Anyone including me not buying Scarface for a second, they would all agree that Michelle Pfeiffer stunk up every scene she appears in. Then, we have to ask...\\"What did anyone ever see in her?\\" She has been a terrible actress for so many years, and it's almost impossible to think of a film that she was at least decent in. All in all, what a mess of a film. It would have been nice to see some realism and comprehensibility in Scarface. I am dropping the rating of the film from `7' to `5'.he film from `7' to `5'.
B00005MM01|5.0|I am really unsure of how EMI obtained the rights to Donovan's four albums SUNSHINE SUPERMAN, MELLOW YELLOW, HURDY GURDY MAN, and BARABAJAGAL, since his catalog at this time was secured by Epic Records (CBS and now a division of Sony) in the USA and were limited (by legal actions) to Pye Records in the UK.  In any event, his first two \\"folk\\" albums from Pye have been captured to varying degrees by the small independent Castle Records on CD since 2003, EMI has reissued the above four mentioned albums in 2005 and 2011, and A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN was released by Collectors' Choice Music (Sony) in 2000 and is (thankfully) still in print.  Even EMI, in their liner notes to the four reissues make note of A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN not being improved upon and alluding to its inclusion in the canon of Donovan's five great works.  Now with that shaky historical fact-check out of the way, let's move on to the music!<br /><br />This was actually my first Donovan record in my youth and it was indeed a gift.  I loved it so much I bought HURDY GURDY MAN when it came out (which became my favorite album of his).  I actually bought SUNSHINE SUPERMAN and MELLOW YELLOW after BARABAJAGAL and DONOVAN'S GREATEST HITS came out in '69, I was a late bloomer you see.  The original release of A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN was a beautiful box, it was actually the first \\"box set\\" for a pop recording and was only the third ever double album set, with a 6 color (the main standard at the time was four-color) photographic print pasted to the front.  It was Donovan in his typical caftan garb holding flowers and peacock feather using an infrared light technique.  The back box photo was of Donovan visiting with the Maharishi.  Donovan was essentially the first celebrity to begin learning Transcendental Meditation under the tutelage of the Maharishi and he would influence The Beatles, Mia and Prudence Farrow, and Mike Love of The Beach Boys to take an interest.  Inside the box was a beautiful folder of art and lyrics sheets for one of the two vinyl discs \\"For Little Ones\\".  The inside top and bottom of the box contained liner notes by Donovan and lyrics to the other disc \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\".  Despite the psychedelic feel of the Wear Your Love Like Heaven album, full of jaunty pop infused with lounge jazz and a splash of Celtic folk, in Donovan's notes he describes the design of the music for both albums as being divided between one for the current generation (\\"an age group which is gently entering marriage\\") and the second for the next generation (\\"For Little Ones\\", \\"the children of the dawning generation\\"), and then he loudly advocated \\"very youth to stop the use of all drugs and heed the quest to seek the sun\\".  Being one of the first initiates of the Maharishi, this no doubt came from that confluence, that Donovan had been very experimental with hallucinogens as a medium of exploration and yet he had also seen many friends move on to harder drugs, and now TM offered a \\"natural\\" means of expanding the mind.<br /><br />The title track to the \\"adult\\" album, Wear Your Love Like Heaven, falls into the broad spectrum of Donovan's psychedelic hippy music, lyrically ethereal with many references to dye colors; Alizarin Crimson, Rose Carmethene, Prussian Blue, Havana Lake, etc.  A hit single, the song is one of the more accessible tunes on the record along with my favorite, Sun, an acoustic vocal melody with lyrical overdubs and pretty arrangement.  Most of the other songs on the Wear Your Love Like Heaven set are lightly experimental.  Under The Greenwood Tree actually uses verse from William Shakespeare and ends with a line from The Lobster Quadrille in Alice's Adventures In Wonderland.  The Land Of Doesn't Have To Be is also a nice experiment, although I have come to love the song of the same name, arranged completely differently and with lyrics not resembling this version at all, which is found as a bonus track on MELLOW YELLOW.  For themost part, the first album has always fallen way short for me but for three or four songs.  The magic really happens with the \\"For Little Ones\\" set (which begins with track 11 on this CD).  Every song is beautifully written, performed, and arranged.  Drawing heavily from Celtic folk, before the advent of pop groups and artists doing much the same, For Little Ones has become a favorite of most adult fans of Donovan.  Yes it was intended for the children of the hippy generation, but it was readily gobbled up before they had a chance!  The songs are nuanced, they are expressive storytelling by a Bard of our generation, and they hold their beauty and attraction to this day.  They can be listened to from start to finish without ever a one of them falling short, each song as enchanting as the one before.  Like a true song-cycle, For Little Ones delivers a message in the medium and of course, coming from Donovan, the message is love.  Donovan obviously wrote the lyrics and had them printed before actual recording as you will find some disparities between listening and reading but other than Lay Of The Last Tinker, none of the changes are distracting.  Lay Of The Last Tinker is one of the most curious songs on For Little Ones, alluding to some rather adult mysteries.  In medieval times, a Tinker was a pot mender and the contents of this pot seems to be a siren or a witch!  The Enchanted Gypsy and Voyage Into The Golden Screen are my two favorites on the set, done up in a style I have been waiting for years to hear covered by the new voice of Celtic sonnets, Loreena McKinnett.  Oh well.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I have underhandedly given low marks to one half of the whole product, I cannot in good conscience give anything other than 5 full stars to this CD.  The remastering is perfect in clarity, volume, and acoustic translation.  Simply beautiful work by Sony.  I do love A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN on the whole, as much as SUNSHINE SUPERMAN and MELLOW YELLOW (they also hold a few imperfections) and although all three albums fall short of HURDY GURDY MAN for me, taking an objective listener view, I have to admit that many others may not feel so much the same for some of the songs I might call weak.  Mind you nothing at all about this album is \\"bad\\", not by a long stretch, it is just that the majority of Wear Your Love Like Heaven (identified on this CD as \\"Phonograph Record 1\\") never has held my attention as well as For Little Ones (\\"Phonograph Record 2\\").  Some fans feel that this box set was a step down from MELLOW YELLOW and SUNSHINE SUPERMAN, other believe contrary.  Bottom line up front: it depends on your taste in music.  If you are a real fan of Donovan, there are five treasures to love from SUNSHINE through BARABAJAGAL.  If you are a casual fan, you might lean in one direction or the other, but the two releases before and after this release (found on EMI releases) are subtly different from each other.  SUNSHINE and YELLOW are flower-power psychedelic folk-pop-rock, HURDY and BARABAJAGAL are more pop-jazz-rock oriented on the whole (with frequent splashes of psychedelia and celtic).  Also on both sides of this middle, the recording quality jumped astronomically from 1967 on, and so saying, the latter two after this one were enhanced with better overall sound.  I find myself in the minority of reviewers who think this is Donovan's last great album, as I believe there was one more log to throw on the fire and perhaps even one more after that!<br /><br />I do know one thing:  this album was indeed a gift from a flower to a garden!most part, the first album has always fallen way short for me but for three or four songs.

B005974CNA|5.0|If there's one thing I'd have to pick about this album, one thing that I liked the most, is how well the group worked on it - there's a feeling of togetherness you haven't heard in a long time. Egos feel put aside - perhaps Petrucci finally realized that he no longer needs to prove anything. For the first time since \\"Six Degrees\\" you actually get to hear John Myung play, and boy does he play. The keyboards are back too, in a grand way - \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" type of grand, even though at times Rudess is going overboard with all kind of effects, it is all forgiven a few minutes later.<br /><br />And more than that, there's a synergy between them, a pleasure to play and play with music, a lack of fear to try and experiment, the kind of stuff you get to hear in their spontaneous live jams and crazy impromptu renditions of songs you know they love to play.<br /><br />This is an album that'll often find you often reminiscent of Images and Words, from which \\"On the Back of Angels\\" seems pluck straightly out of, will find you with eyebrows raised wondering what-the-heck they're doing - intro to \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" or \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" or \\"Outcry\\", only to find yourself completely hoodwinked in the middle of a musical track that is absolutely breathless.<br /><br />The overall tone is much like \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" - operatic, large, yet without being pretentious; you'll find often thinking that parts of the tracks could very well belong in the melodic complexity of \\"Images and Words\\", in the technical \\"Six Degrees\\" (there's a few songs with more time signature changes that you can likely count), or even the aggressive but thoughtful vein of \\"Awake\\" (rather than the plain aggressiveness of \\"Train of Thought\\").<br />What's more, the lyrics are once again great. No more silly vampires, masons, pharaohs, or writer's block. Honestly, I'm willing to forgive Petrucci the lyric work on \\"Black Clouds\\"for what he's done here. Hey, even Myung was allowed to contribute a song.<br /><br />There's only two tracks that feel not necessarily like feelers, but like the album could've done without: the keyboard ballad \\"Far from Heaven\\" (is this Rudess's \\"Space Died Vest\\" but without being awkwardly awesome?) and the somewhat clunky \\"Beneath the Surface\\". It's probably not a coincidence that they're also the shortest tracks on the album, at at uncommon for DT 4 minutes for former and a 5 for the latter.<br /><br />I almost forgot - Mangini is awesome on drums (and more important, he doesn't try to \\"sing\\").

I almost forgot - Mangini is awesome on drums (and more important, he doesn't try to \\"sing\\"). It feels maybe a tiny bit too clinical and precise at times (see how perfectly he nailed the audition), but everything in this album is about working together, and in that he succeeds greatly.    Maybe it took four albums for this to be birthed, and if so it was worth the wait.
0553801473|2.0|This was not George R.R. Martin's best work. This was not an adventure, this was a journey. Unfortunately, the journey went nowhere. Two-thirds of the book was about half a dozen characters making their way to Daenerys and her dragons. Once they arrived, nothing happens. The other third of the book is filled with profanity and references about sex. Most of the characters in the Dance With Dragons are minor characters that you don't care about and the ones you do care about, like Jon Snow and Tyrion, do nothing. In the middle of the book Martin begins to have some interesting side plots but they never develop. Jaime and Davos just disappear with no mention of where they went. It also seems to be a Song of Ice and Fire theme that no one stays dead. I'm beginning to lose my trust in the author. All in all, I think Martin made his world too big. It's not fun reading a thousand pages of people traveling. I'm sure I will read the next book when and if it comes out, but A Dance With Dragons is dead to me. This one was for the money, not for the fans or for the story. See you in another six years, Westeros.

B005BJ7Y54|5.0|The name of this San Francisco band pretty much consolidates every traditional pop song down to its root cause.<br /><br />The band takes pop roots and branches them out, sometimes elevating them to heavy-metal heights and acid-rock lengths, as on the sprawling \\"Die,\\" which contains the lines, giddily voiced, \\"None of us is gonna be just fine / No, we're all going straight to hell tonight.\\"<br /><br />At other times, band mates Christopher Owens and JR White (with three new members added for Girls' second release) settle into hypnotic, lo-fi splendor, as on the sunny, yet shady \\"Alex,\\" with lead singer Owens mumbling his lines in a drug-addled manner. Or the down-tempo, blues-rocker \\"How Can I Say I Love You,\\" with its bittersweet message, \\"How can I say I need you? ... how can I say I want you? ... now that you've said everything I said to you / To somebody new?\\"<br /><br />To be sure, \\"Father, Son, Holy Ghost,\\" so named to illustrate the spiritual kinship Girls feels toward music, employs a variety of moods.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the psych-surf \\"Honey Bunny,\\" bouncy and strange like Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. The roiling, rollicking \\"Vomit\\" moves from ominous to dewy-eyed in the space of a few minutes. The bulk of the songs are backed by a three-piece gospel choir, a key ingredient that unifies the frantic mix.<br /><br />Toward the end is the album's shining highlight, \\"Forgiveness,\\" a slow-cooker about letting go of deep grudges before they tear you apart, with its woozy keys, crisp acoustic guitar and bellowing bass drum. A bleary Owens croaks, \\"No one's gonna find any answers / If you're just trying to hide / From the things you know inside / Are the truth,\\" the eight-minute spectacle eventually boiling over into a fury of white-hot licks and percussive thunder.<br /><br />There is definitely something magic going on here (and not just the track called \\"Magic\\"). \\"Holy Ghost\\" is an adventure inside a rock 'n' roll Bizarro World. It feels as if this is music that's been put to wax before -- there's that deja-vu tingle -- but the riffs and melodies are slightly off balance, like a chair at the local coffee shop. The tightly wound, gritty, almost claustrophobic sensation that permeates \\"Holy Ghost\\" comes from Girls' intentional choice to record it in a small, concrete studio in the heart of the Tenderloin.<br /><br />That decision in itself may be a bit of nostalgia for Owens, a one-time member of the Children of God (now scarily rebranded as the less conspicuous Family International), who lived on the streets of San Francisco for a time after leaving the religious cult at the age of 16. Owens is graced with an unsuspectingly powerful voice. It creeps along for a while, but by the fourth song, he opens up and takes charge. Owens is particularly affecting on \\"My Ma,\\" a feverish ode to his lost childhood, and a family with which he now must be completely at odds. His voice cracks with raw emotion as he sings, \\"Oh God, I'm tired / And my heart is broken / It's so hard to feel so all alone / And so far, so far away from home.\\"<br /><br />\\"Holy Ghost\\" is a weighty, existential affair. As such, it will never translate to the fresh-faced, overly overt, Day-Glo dance floor that is today's pop landscape. But for those who prefer meals, not snacks, \\"Holy Ghost\\" is the kind of album that gently gets under your skin and stays there.

0385534639|5.0|If there is magic, in the world as I know it, it is found in the pages of books.  And Erin Morgenstern's debut novel, The Night Circus, is the most magical, transporting experience I've had in quite some time.  It opens in 1873, backstage in a New York theater with these words, \\"The man billed as Prospero the Enchanter receives a fair amount of correspondence via the theater office, but this is the first envelope addressed to him that contains a suicide note, and it is also the first to arrive carefully pinned to the coat of a five-year-old girl.\\"  And so it is that Hector Bowen learns of the existence of his daughter, Celia.  Hector's response to his change in circumstances is unenthusiastic, but he soon discovers that Celia is a chip off the old block.  You see, Hector only pretends to be an illusionist on stage.  The magic he practices is entirely real--and Celia has inherited talent.<br /><br />Hector is not content to merely mentor his daughter.  He contacts his associate, Mr. A. H- about a wager.  A deal is struck, after which that gentleman returns to London and adopts a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his own, the orphaned Marco.  These two young people are raised unconventionally, studying magic under their tutors' philosophies, all the while knowing there will be a competition between the two of them some day.  Enter impresario Chandresh Lef&egrave;vre, who has imagined something wondrous.  He explains:<br /><br />\\"More than a circus, really, like no circus anyone has ever seen.  Not a single large tent but a multitude of tents, each with a particular exhibition.  No elephants or clowns. No, something more refined than that.  Nothing commonplace.  This will be different, this will be an utterly unique experience, a feast for the senses.  Theatrics sans theater, an immersive entertainment.  We will destroy the presumptions and preconceived notions of what a circus is and make it something else entirely, something new.\\"<br /><br />And so the venue for the magical competition between Celia and Marco is born.  And there you have the bare bones of Ms. Morgenstern's story.  There's no need to tell more.  The magic of this tale is in the language and the characters and in Ms. Morgenstern's infinitely rich, romantic imagination.<br /><br />The circus, it is said, \\"arrives without warning.\\"  Not so this novel.  There have been all kinds of pre-pub buzz and hype for this title.  There's a reason; this book is so special that almost all who read it take note.  Ms. Morgenstern's tale transcended the page and brought true enchantment to my oh-so-ordinary life. As it happens, one of the characters could be speaking for the author herself:<br /><br />\\"I find I think of myself not as a writer so much as someone who provides a gateway, a tangential route for readers to reach the circus.  To visit the circus again, if only in their minds, when they are unable to attend it physically.  I relay it through printed words on crumpled newsprint, words they can read again and again, returning to the circus whenever they wish, regardless of time of day or physical location.  Transporting them at will.<br /><br />When put that way, it sounds rather like magic, doesn't it?\\"<br /><br />Oh yes, it does!

If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was indeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our rough calculation--based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks making up the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)--indicates that if Raskob's prescription had been followed during 1929-1948, the investor's holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been worth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man's promise of $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such optimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should remark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation would have been better than 8% compounded annually.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Well, I think that a monthly investment of $15 compounded at 8% after 20 years is $8,566.64  which is much more than \\"about $8,500\\":    year 15$ / month to be compounded 8% accumulated end of year  1 180         90.00                 7.20  97.20           187.20   2 180         277.20                22.18  299.38           389.38   3 180         479.38                38.35  517.73           607.73   4 180         697.73                55.82  753.54           843.54   5 180         933.54                74.68  1,008.23  1,098.23   6 180       1,188.23                95.06  1,283.29  1,373.29   7 180       1,463.29               117.06  1,580.35  1,670.35   8 180       1,760.35               140.83  1,901.18  1,991.18   9 180       2,081.18               166.49  2,247.67  2,337.67   10 1802,427.67               194.21  2,621.88  2,711.88   11 180       2,801.88               224.15  3,026.04  3,116.04   12 180       3,206.04               256.48  3,462.52  3,552.52   13 180       3,642.52               291.40  3,933.92  4,023.92   14 180       4,113.92               329.11  4,443.03  4,533.03   15 180       4,623.03               369.84  4,992.88  5,082.88   16 180       5,172.88               413.83  5,586.71  5,676.71   17 180       5,766.71               461.34  6,228.04  6,318.04   18 180       6,408.04               512.64  6,920.69  7,010.69   19 180       7,100.69               568.05  7,668.74  7,758.74   20 180       7,848.74               627.90  8,476.64  8,566.64

0553801473|5.0|A lot of reviews mentioning too many kill offs, a slow read, at times overly grotesque, etc...  I have to agree to a point.  But if you enjoyed the previous books, A Dance with Dragons is another meticulous, detailed adventure through Martin's world that is still absolutely fascinating and it kept me engrossed all the way through.  If you allow yourself to sink into the book and enjoy the descriptions, I still found it to be well worth the read.  One can only hope we don't have to wait 5 years for the next one but if it is as good as this one I will read it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I came late to this book series.  I admit to watching the HBO series before buying a book.  I had other things to do when these came out.  But I am an epic fantasy fan.  And this is the real deal.  I almost didn't buy DWD after reading the reviews.  Having gone against the recommendations, I decided to write this.<br /><br />This is not the end of the series.  This is a stage-setter/chess-piece-placing book.  Read FOC and DWD back to back and you almost cannot tell they are two books.  There is a lot of scene to set because there are lots of pieces in this game of thrones.  Old plots merely hinted at in earlier books and deeper games come through here.  Reread GOT and dots come out that weren't obvious the first time through.<br /><br />I did not give it Five Stars because there was just one too many descriptions of food.  I get the Gatsby-esque significance of the food.  I expect to see some PhD work on it someday.  But like all that color in Gatsby, I want the story.<br /><br />I would buy it again.  And I look forward to the next one.  GRRM has written himself into some spots that I want to see him get out of.

Now, when I charge it to 100%, the battery dies just minutes later. It's supposed to last 8hrs when fully charged, and I could not finish a race with it (the race took 1 hour 40 mins to complete, and the Garmin died 1 hour into the race). If you want a product to help you get better, faster, etc. and something you can monitor a run with, I would not choose this one.

I'm just making this opinion from watching it, and now I wish I hadn't. It can never be unseen. This is a horrible act of artistic vandalism. I wish George Lucas would have just done this at home for his own entertainment, and left the fans with what they truly wanted. What a shame.

You won't get another dime from me, ever, until this is done.  No discs, downloads, figures, conventions, etc.  You don't bite the hand that feeds you, but I guess it will take cutting your sales figures back to draw your attention back to this fact.      DON'T SETTLE FOR THIS RELEASE!!!  IF YOU WANT THE ORIGINALS TO EVER GET A RESTORED, HD RELEASE, YOU CAN'T GIVE IN AND BUY THESE SPECIAL EDITIONS!!!    As far as the Prequel additions and improvements are concerned, who really gives a crap.  It's sort of like polishing a turd.      NO SALE!!!
0618680004|5.0|For anyone who has ever questioned the existence of a God or for those of you who think you're secure in your beleif that there is a God, read this book!  This book exposes the ways in which history has been manipulated by the influence of religion and how religion is nothing more than a tool that allows few to control the many, including entire countries.  More people have been butchered in the name of religion than for any other cause yet even civilized societies turn a blind eye and deaf ear to the ridiculousness of it all. There is no God, never has been, and it's okay that there isn't.  There is nothing to fear about the truth.  In fact, without religion the world would be a better place yet the delusion continues.  Once you read this book, you'll see how people have been brain washed to believe in the most ridiculous untruth and you'll wonder how it is that any educated person can continue to believe in a God.  Blind faith is just plain stupid!

B0056BMK6K|4.0|This book was exactly what I expected it to be, so I wasn't disappointed.     If you've never tried to market anything via social media it has some good ideas. John Locke was honest that he did a lot of writing before he ever tried any of the marketing techniques he outlines. If you get one thing out of it, it should be that in order to sell ebooks, you've got to get in a chair and write them. Once you've got your stable of horses ready to run, get your social media on and get to work.    I appreciated his insight into writing for a niche market and his ideas on effective marketing with a blog.

There were no manuals back then, no procedures, nothing to base anything on as this was all brand new, never been done before so things had to be made up on the spot and revised over time. Since lives were depending on the procedures everything had to be correct first time around. Along with procedures for Mission Control, the global communications network had to be built, recovery procedures etc. etc.<br />This is a totally engrossing tale of the hardships that the people at mission control went through, the problems that they encountered including the lightning strike on Apollo 12 and of course Apollo 13.<br />One of the best Apollo era books I have read (and I have read quite a few).<br />Recommended.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've had this on pre-order since I first heard about it.  I was stoked to finally get a Blu-Ray Hi-def version of the films.  I suspected that George was going to make a few changes here and there - and hey, he owns them, he can do that.  I didn't mind too much.    And I could have lived with pretty much every change - EXCEPT NoooooooooGate.      CGI Yoda in Phantom Meanace?  Ok.  Change Obi-Wan's scream in New Hope?  Comical, but livable.  Make the Ewoks blink?  Ok.     Every other change I've read about/seen didn't really bother me.  But this?  Again changing a character's performance (Han shoots first was bad enough, but most everyone -lived- with it).  David Prowse's body language was ALL that needed to be said in that, frankly, very historic and very powerful scene.  Make all the little cosmetic and CGI-happy changes you like to your films.  I don't care.  We don't care (mostly).  But completely and unnecessarily destroy an actor's performance - AGAIN?  That's the last straw for this fan.    I'm not wasting my money.  I'll stick to my DVDs and VHS originals.
B000088DSQ|5.0|The Harnoncourt Teldec recordings are most well-engineered recordings of classical music I have ever heard, and this set is my favorite among them. The third piano concerto in particular was never my favorite work, but I cannot stop listening to this particular recording of it. Something about the combination of Harnoncourt's style and the Teldec engineering brings incredible power to the sound of the strings that I have not heard anywhere else. I also love the position of the piano in the mix, which gives you the impression that you are in the hall rather than listening to a recording. The piano is too far forward in too many concerto recordings. Even though the piano is never right in your face, there is no lack of detail; you can clearly hear Aimard breathing on the cadenza of the first movement of the third, which adds to the tension of the moment. The whole set makes you feel more purely connected to the performances than any other classical recording I know of. Great stuff.

In my opinion, this is the strength of Ries' book: it is a call to action to anyone inclined to take action to make things better despite facing severe uncertainty.  There is no boundaries to where you can exercise your entrepreneurship.  And though Eric doesn't state so explicitly, true entrepreneurs are those willing to admit to the uncertainly within the institutions they inhabit AND to develop solutions that solve problems in the face of that uncertainty.<br /><br />This definition applies to social entrepreneurship, non-profits, education, government, large successful businesses, and any business with technology risk or market risk, including yes, high tech startups.<br /><br />To succeed, or at least to maximize one's chances to succeed, Eric's principles regarding why and how to Build - Measure - Learn is vital.  It requires new thinking and new methodologies, especially in change-averse cultures that are in the most dire need of disruption.<br /><br />More in-depth review here: [...]
B004WPYNY8|3.0|As I say in the title of this review, this is a powerful cd with incredible production, it sounds perfect, the drums, guitars, everything. Even the bass sound perfect in the must hardest passages of the album. Incredible. The instrumental technique and Russell Allen's voice at the height are dreamed by every fan of Symphony X... But I'm sorry, the songs are good but are all very similar. I miss the melodic passages in heavy songs, this only happens in \\"When all is lost\\" and \\"Reign in madness\\" and for me are the best. We can not ignore the amazing \\"Iconoclast\\" is another outstanding song. But the other songs, better and worse, they sound all the same thing, power  metal with some progressive touches. In short, opt for the sound of \\"Paradise Lost\\" and away from the sound of \\"Divine Wings ... \\" and \\"The Odyssey\\". A shame. Anyway I re-emphasize one of the best singers in the world ... Mr. Russell Allen.
B005DI65L2|1.0|As much as I love the subject matter, I had a hard time ploughing through this book.  I could read no more than a couple of pages at a time before this author irritated me or lost my interest.  I hoped for a scientist's matter-of-fact views of canine personality, psychology, behavior and so on.  But the author delivers a pseudo intellectual monologue which meanders through ideas ranging from Ludwig Wittgenstein to Gary Larson, tangled around anecdotes about her own dog, written in stilted prose.  Like this particular passage on page 223, which summed up the book for me:  \\"The overflowing garbage, collector of the day's past, is more than a little evocative when considering the memory of a dog.\\"  I gained no new insight on dogs, so to my overflowing garbage, I've added this book.
B005974CNA|5.0|Fresh air for my ears.I think DREAM THEATER have made a great album , the best since \\"Scenes from a memory\\",progessive,melodic and heavy with great instrumental passages which highlights Jordan Rudess more than ever. Long songs (maybe not as much as in their last two cd) in which every member of the band do a great job as musicians and songwriters. On this album we find the classic Dream Theater songs like \\"On the back of Angels\\" and \\"Lost not forgoten\\" (the latter is a mix of \\"Take the Time\\" and \\"Under glass moon\\") and other DREAM THEATER more modern \\"Build me up, Break me down\\" it sounds like the mix of DREAM THEATER and RED. Strange mix, right? I think so but this song is good(although many people do not like this song, I like, sorry).  The chorus of \\"Bridges in the sky\\", \\"Build me up, Break me down\\" or \\"Outcry\\" are awesome with great melody and strength and a half time \\"This is the life\\" is great with a sublime Petrucci. The only song that I don't like is \\"Far from Heaven\\".The song is not bad but i think down the rhythm of the cd and it is too sweet.Anyway the song is shorter, is less than four minutes. Mike Mangini has done a very good job with  songs already made and I think the next album we will see a sublime Mangini, such as.Mike Portnoy (i miss you?) that being one of the best drummer in the world I do not miss the horrible voice that put on a few songs from the album \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" to the \\"Black clouds...\\"(Hey guy, you were born to play the drums not to sing).Just saying that as a fan of Dream Theater I'm very happy with this album.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I'm kind of surprised by how good Worship Music is.  It's been so long since an Anthrax album, and even longer since their music had Joey's vocals in the mix.  Others might disagree, but I think they pulled it off.  It has the feel of an incredibly solid modern metal album, but I still hear traces of most of their older releases.  Some melodies and choruses remind me of Spreading the Disease, the faster songs would fit on Among the Living, a few riffs bring to mind State of Euphoria, others would sound at home on Persistence of Time.  A few tracks have the crunch of the John Bush era, but most have the flavor of classic Anthrax, with excellent results.  Joey sounds great, the music is tight and heavy, even some of the backing vocals bring back the old days...overall, it's just a tremendous effort.  I'm not going to say it was worth the wait, as eight years is a ridiculous amount of time between albums, but I am glad it's out and that it's better than I expected it to be.
B000069AT7|5.0|E.T. is a wonderful movie. A perfect 80s movie for people of all ages. I've loved this movie since I was a kid and, watching it again, I got that warm feeling that I did back then. E.T. just puts you in a nice, comforting place that you don't want to leave. The gift set is just packed with a bunch of great stuff :  There's a book that has the entire script from the movie. There is also a frame of film from the movie. (pretty cool) The set includes the \\"walkie-talkie\\" cut from 2002 where they ruined the movie by putting cgi effects and removing the guns and replacing them with walkie-talkies. There is also the correct, original 1982 version, as well as a disc of incredible extras. The 20th anniversary soundtrack in also in the set. Perhaps the best extra in the set is the live soundtrack performance from the 2002 anniversary party/premiere of the movie, where John Williams conducted the score live over top of the movie.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|My SAMSUNG PLASMA TV had only an optical audio out. My stereo had only RCA analog in.  This unit along with a 6 foot toslink cable and RCA cable solved the problem perfectly. Watched  a movie and the sound was superb with no audio lag from the conversion.  Extremely happy with this purchase.
B0056HTEC2|5.0|I got my copy of this CD a few days ago. Listen on my drive to and from work each day. Easy to listen to, seeing that the music and Hugh Laurie voice to not over power each other.
B001LMU182|5.0|the sound is way better than the original in my opinion or maybe it is because the last time i saw the movie was on the betamax format? :P anyway this is a great remastered version of an all time fave. really worth the purchase for any fan.
B005974CDU|4.0|This is a highly anticipated release from Dream Theater, especially because of the departure of Portnoy last year.  So, how does this album fair?  It's a good album, but not a five star recording, at least to my ears.  For me, it's a mixed bag.  I love the fact that Portnoy is no longer enthralling us with his \\"inferior\\" vocals or growls.  For that, I'm totally happy.  He just ruined some of the songs with that (The Shattered Fortress should have been a spectacular song ending the 'The Glass Prison' suite, but it was anti-climatic and his role in the song was absolutely horrible and did ruin the song).  He should of just taken over lead vocal duties then.  For this album I've enjoyed it, but really can't say that I would keep it playing for repeated listens.  I will include it in my mix on my Ipod so when the songs come up that would be fine.  I'm not seeing anything earth shattering here and some of the songs almost made me think that this was a LaBrie solo release.  One thing I will say as someone else noted too is that I've had it also with Rudess and his keyboard playing.  I can't be the only out there that notices his \\"liquid leads\\" as noted by someone else and that his playing just sounds the same time and time again (as in him harkening back to ragtime days on multiple songs in previous albums).  Not that I want every album to sound like 'Images' or 'Awake' but when songs from those albums come up in my mix there really isn't any comparison.  So, with that said I'm not saying that this is a bad release, but probably a 3.5 star rating.  For me, it's okay (good), but also it's much better than their last.  Most fans will love it because it's Dream Theater.
B001G70M6S|5.0|My old Polaroid Land Camera is one of the best cameras I've had, hands down.  Now that Fuji is making the film again, she's come out of the closet and is ready for use!  I've snapped so many photos and the quality of the film is just as good as the original.  Dare I say even a little faster?<br /><br />I've already ordered 6 packs of film, and I hope that Fuji continues to make it!  Thanks!
1594744769|5.0|I am an avid reader and an adult, I picked up this book because the title and the synopsis were very intriguing. I sometimes have a hard time picturing what the author was trying to get across, and if the author puts in enough details that I can easliy visualize it then I usually get bored from the tedium of the descriptions. While reading I could clearly imagine all the things he described and then was able to see pictures that enhanced what I had already pictured. This book was fantastic and I look forward to reading the next novel Randsom Riggs writes. This is an amazing work for a first time novel.
159514188X|5.0|Just because this is a YA targeted book does not mean it can't affect an older audience!<br /><br />I am a 21-year-old college student and I love this book. At times it's hard to read, very. Many times I had to close it and walk away for little while, but Jay Asher wrote such an awesome story that I returned to it to continue the journey. You'll wish you could have saved Hannah, cry at the pain Clay feels, and want to have a word or two with the people on Hannah's list. This book is so powerful.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Wonderful movie set. I like that each movie has it's own cover so you can travel or just take the ones you want. We enjoyed watching them all. I am sure they will be watched over and over again.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Bought this last week and took it to the lake to see if it could handle the water. Went tubing, skiing, cliff jumping, and swimming. Not one single drop of water entered the watch. The watch it self is pretty small but is still easy to read and also seems to \\"disappear\\" because of its light weight design. The luminescent glow on the watch seems to work pretty well, its always \\"glowing\\" throughout the whole night. Its a faint glow but you can still tell what time it is. I like the band that comes with it, holds up well and has a cool military look to it. With the right tools, changing the band is really easy as well. I would definitely buy this watch again and again, and with this price you're stupid if you don't.
B000094HMU|1.0|Poor sound quality.    I'll admit I'm not a big fan of Turandot, but this production does nothing to win me over.   Did they not pay the light bill?   It's so dark during the opening scenes that you can't see what's happening.  I'm not sure what effect they were trying to achieve with the direction, lighting, and camera work, but I felt like I was watching rats scurrying around in a dimly lit sewer.   Bizarre costumes in some cases (e.g., Turandot).       Bottom line:  unlistenable and unwatchable.      In contrast, following are my recommendations for wonderful film adaptations of Puccini operas:     1. La Boheme starring Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon  2. Madame Butterfly starring Ying Huang and Richard Troxell  3. Tosca starring Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna
B005974CDU|5.0|Portnoy did his best to destroy this band, but thank god he's gone. I was getting really tired of all the growling and Dark master, cheese metal non-sense. This album is damn good and comes surprisingly close to matching the brilliance of Images and Words. Its going to take time to really digest this thing since there's just so much to experience, but I will say that this is a huge leap in the right direction.  I can once again be proud to be a Dream Theater fan, instead of being embarrassed, like the last 6 years.
B005IEF27O|4.0|I originally gave this 1 star and after a few more listens, that WAS too harsh and too hasty of a reaction.  A few of the songs really grew on me when I listened to the full album on headphones.  I also listened to it in a mix of other Primus albums and that really helped me enjoy it more.      However, with that I realized that musically and song-structure-wise, Last Salmon man = Toys go winding down....listen to them side by side :)    I increased my review to 4 stars.  It's probably closer to 3.  But, I felt like a tool for giving it 1 star after 1 listen.  So, 4 it gets.  Enjoy!        +++ORIGINAL REVIEW+++    I've been a Primus fan since Frizzle Fry.  Either I've out-grown Primus or they've out-grown me.    If you've enjoyed Les' last two solo albums, then you may enjoy this one.  Like the \\"Of Whales and Whoa\\" & \\"Of Fungi and Foe\\", I did not enjoy this album and think it sounds rushed and 1/2 finished.  I don't know if Les forgot how to actually sing or just doesn't want to do it any longer.  This album is full of low growly-talking throughout.  Musically, it just sounds like sporadic nonsense.  There are a few riffs during some of the songs that grab your attention.  But, there are no hooks to keep your interest.  Just some talking over a jam session.    There is a live version of \\"Those Damned Blue Collared Tweekers\\" at the end.  I guess that is the album's only saving grace for me.
B003102JDM|5.0|- Might be the subtitle of this film.  The Coen brothers did it again, with another satiric masterpiece whose humor is dark, a virtual fart at a funeral.  No belly laughs, just ironic smiles and uneasy twitters as we watch the physics professor protagonist nail the equations of life on his chalkboard, while his own existence unravels and crumbles in one irrational assault on logic after another.  In an update of Job - without the triumph of faith and goodness - the puzzle cannot resolve itself until he takes action.  And as actions have consequences, the negative action produces the negative result.  Not to make a spoiler, but the cat dies.<br /><br />The layout of the film was a perfect recreation of 1967.  Too \\"1967,\\" in fact, which the Coen Bros. did purposely to add surreal subtext. As those of us around then will recall, older architecture abounded and predominated as Federally-funded urban renewal was only just beginning. And plenty of second-hand cars made the streets a rolling open-air auto museum.<br /><br />Not sure what the opening sequence in old Austrian Galicia added to the film, except to further the sense of reality's deception and false consciousness.  Even though the film is very oi gestalt Ivrit, it will leave long and lingering thoughts behind.  A modern classic.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The instructions weren't as explicit as they should have been, but I figured it out.    What impressed me most is how quickly they shipped it out. It was on my doorstep in the minimum time.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|This is an excellent movie; I have seen all of the robin hood movies and read all of the stories about the legend of Robin Hood.  This film takes the stories once sung by minstrels, takes the known historical facts and creates a film that tells us how a simple man became the talk of centuries past.  Russel Crowe portrays 'Robin of the Hood' with much more of a strong masculinity than others have; you cannot help but wrapped up in this story that keeps you enthralled from moment to moment.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I had just come back from a road trip from Hampton Roads, VA to Cincinnati and back. My accord doesn't have AUX in, but I love my iPod Touch, and got a Belkin FM transmitter for, like, $80.  Gotta work well for that price, right? WRONG. The only place I was relatively static free was in the mountains, at 2000 feet.  Other than that, I was constantly changing broadcast stations, looking for new \\"blank\\" ones, and even trying their auto-tune thingy which is supposed to do the work for you.  It was horrible.  Tried a Scosche, no better.  So, I went online here to see what was rated highly.    Enter the Soundfly.    So many positive reviews, I wondered if the company execs forced their employees to write favorable reviews to boost the ratings.  I gave it a shot anyway.  Put it in a cupholder 12v expander I had, so it's down low in the car.  Chose a frequency that didn't seem TOO bad, and headed back to Cincinnati.      The reviews are totally legit! I didn't have to change the frequency from the time I left until I got past the Ohio border! It was totally clear, great volume, and the bass and treble controls actually DO boost the bass and treble! Hooked my iPod to it using a standard mini cable and worked great! Put some mp3's on an SD card and threw that in it, and it was great, showing artist and title, the folders I put songs in, just pimpin'! How many exclamation points can I put in one review?    Seriously, I don't know how they sell it so cheap, but it is worth double the price on here, certainly better than any other FM transmitter I've ever used.  And if I decide to change the radio one day, and it has aux, this is already prepared for that.  There's a slight learning curve as far as what controls/adjustments are where, but it is totally worth it.    Buy it - you will not be disappointed, I promise!
0062502182|5.0|Every page of this book spoke to my heart.  It gave me a gentle nudge I needed towards not giving into my fears so I could listen to my heart and make the decisions I knew I needed to make... but didn't quite have the courage.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|when I first heard about zoom I was very excited as my kinect was collecting dust because I don't have enough space in my living room to use it properly, honestly I was skeptical in the begining as I didn't think it will work. I received it today by mail, the installation was very easy, took only 2-3 minutes, make sure you recalibrate your kinect after you put the zoom on it, and viola, I'm only 4 foot from tv and this thing really works, my kinect detecting me with no problems, I played kinect adventure for about 1 hour with no issues at all, finally I can use my kinect without having to move the sofa every time I want to play.    finally the quality of zoom is really excellent, it's not some cheap plastic, it feels sturdy and the lenses looks really good quality.    if you have kinect  definitely get zoom unless space is not an issue for you
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|This album is so funky I put in nose plugs and covered my head with a plastic bag in a room full of scented candles and the funk still flowed through. High energy, impeccable musicianship, mixed with down and dirty compositions make \\"For True\\" a real triumph to the highest degree.  Ain't it amazing what these kids can do with real musical instruments these days.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I have now returned 2 of these sets because they will not play... 3rd is on it's way and I do not hold out much hope that they will play either. Such a wonderful show with the worst manufacturing defects I have ever seen.
0062060554|5.0|Before I Go To Sleep is easily one of the best books of the summer, and I don't throw around the term \\"best\\" lightly.<br /><br />When Christine wakes the first morning we meet her, we are just as confused as she is. Who is she? Who is she in bed with? Why is she older than she thinks she is? How is it possible to live without knowing these things? By the time I got to the beginning of her journal, I was hooked for sure. I found this severe case of amnesia fascinating.<br /><br />There's something compelling about a book with an unreliable narrator. Not only are we not sure what we can believe, but Christine isn't sure if even she can believe her own writings. We bounce around her head with her as she vacillates between knowing and not knowing, trusting and not trusting. We applaud each step she takes forward, and cringe with each step she takes backwards.<br /><br />And the ending... The ending!! It's been a long time since I got to the end of a book and said \\"Where's the rest?\\" But not in a bad way. Without giving too much away, I would love to know what happens next, but I think the author made the right choice in ending it the way she did. The twist was not at all what I expected; the bait-and-switch was brilliant.<br /><br />I'll be looking forward to what's next to come from S.J. Watson.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|This book is written very true to Jaycee Dugard's voice, or what I think is her voice. Therefore it's not as polished as you would think for a published book. That's a positive and negative as it can be hard to follow at times. When I purchased the book, I only considered the \\"happy ending\\" that I knew happened. Jaycee talks very frankly about the initial abuse when she was 11 and while I DO get the importance to her story, it was more than I could stomach to read - how an 11 year old was molested and raped repeatedly. It also made me queasy to think of some pedophile reading it.<br /><br />After the initial rape, I read a few more pages and just skipped the section where they met the Berkley police officers. From that point on, it was very heartening and the recovery process was interesting. I'm glad I didn't put it down completely as the final chapters were uplifting and inspirational.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I bought this because my printer had an expansion slot, and  i can tell you this, it made the time it takes to print a document decrease drastically, we're talking from 40 seconds to first page to 2 seconds to first page.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I'm beginning to wonder if this isn't some early King work never before published.  I thought the characters were well fleshed-out, interesting, and diverse (as per normal King style) but the plot and the \\"villain\\" were lacking.  Without introducing spoilers, there is at least one significant plot event which just kind of happens with no lead up or explanation as to why the character acted that way - it seemed overly contrived.  The villain is too non-descript and the reader is left in the dark as to the origin and motivation of the villain so that he/she/it is simply not scary or interesting - very weak in my opinion as well as redundant for King.<br /><br />The addition of the preview to his next novel is the only thing that makes it semi-worth the $2.99 price.
B000AM2L1O|4.0|My nieces who just turned 1 love it. They drag it, eat it, carry it and it seems pretty durable. Plus they're half-french, so it's a perfect combination.

B0015RB72W|5.0|So nice to have vinyl available.....a long time ago, everything we bought was vinyl...guess we didn't know how lucky we were!.

185984054X|4.0|Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, commonly known as Mother Teresa,  is widely regarded as a saint, a salutation which the Catholic Church is sure to make official.  Hitchens questions this common acceptance, looking at what she actually did rather than how she has been portrayed.  Even using the altruist-collectivist ethical yardstick (or meter stick?) that he does, Mother Teresa doesn't fare well.<br /><br />Hitchens holds that Mother Teresa is a dogmatic cultist who believes that suffering and poverty are spiritual goods, (who once referred to excrutiating suffering as being \\"kissed by Jesus\\" --since one has the opportunity to \\"share\\" in his suffering) and is fundamentally only interested in furthering the theological agenda of the Church.  As such, she keeps herself and all those around her poor and suffering.  Her Missionaries of Charity organization, while having some 600 missions in more than 100 countries, is poor by choice (having once even rejected a building because an elevator for the handicapped was legally required to be installed, something she considered too extravagant -- apparently it interfered with her missions' ability to carry the poor up and down the flights).  These 'missions' also have been reported to reuse IV needles, keep orphans in the most deplorable conditions, and withhold all but the most ineffective palliatives for the sick and dying.  Believing that it is \\"very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot,\\" she apparently kept things very beautiful.<br /><br />Apparently all of this occured unnecessarily.  Mother Teresa has accepted untold numbers of awards and countless donations (100's of millions, billions, who knows), achieving a cult-like status that could have easily provided outstanding services to the poor; however, she deliberately chose poverty and suffering (afterall, if they were no longer poor and suffering, what good would that do when \\"...the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.\\" -MT)  Moreover, she has accepted this untold wealth from the most horrendous dictators and corrupt individuals, thereby lending her 'status' to assuage their guilt and improve their status.<br /><br />Finally, Hitchens takes umbrage with the stance of this \\"old virgin\\" and her fundamentalist opposition to any form of birth control that would empower women--structural reforms he believes will alleviate a great deal of suffering , suffering he regards as unecessary-- which makes her no friend to the poor.<br /><br />In a style that is Christopher Hitchens, this book is well researched and an effective polemic against a widely-regarded 'saint'.  This book is a good reminder that we need to apply rational scrutiny even to those most widely regarded amoung us.accepted this untold wealth from the most horrendous dictators and corrupt individuals, thereby lending her 'status' to assuage their guilt and improve their status.<br /><br />Finally, Hitchens takes umbrage with the stance of this \\"old virgin\\" and her fundamentalist opposition to any form of birth control that would empower women--structural reforms he believes will alleviate a great deal of suffering , suffering he regards as unecessary-- which makes her no friend to the poor.<br /><br />In a style that is Christopher Hitchens, this book is well researched and an effective polemic against a widely-regarded 'saint'.

B004JPJHME|5.0|Let me be frank and honest up front about this: you HAVE to love Hunter S. Thompson or you will NOT enjoy this movie. I see a lot of reviewers saying that the movie is trash - I counter by saying that they probably haven't read this book or any of his other works. This is an incredibly faithful adaptation of the book, and captures the Gonzo feel of the writing. It's really a testament to Terry Gilliam's directing ability as well as Johnny Depp's range that made this movie the masterpiece it is.     The blu-ray is beautiful, the sound is amazing, and it is completely worth it in every way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games kept appearing in my recommendations every time I logged onto my Amazon account and always I blew it off. I had read the synopsis but thought it just wouldn't be my thing. One day, on a whim, I decided to give it a try and though it is (as I knew it would be) pretty violent, it is also a wonderful book. I found myself still feeling like I was in the arena with Katniss long after the book ended, its message still feeling so tangible. All I can say is, I wish I had read this series sooner!<br /><br />16 year old Katniss Everdeen, an expert (illegal) hunter from District 12 lives in a bleak version of a country that used to be the United States, now known as Panem. Spending her days sneaking under the fence that surrounds her district to hunt with her best friend Gale, Katniss provides her family with desperately needed food and is more like a mother to her younger sister Prim after her father died and her mother is a shell of her former self.<br /><br />In this futuristic world, the government has absolute control over its citizens, including what food they can eat and what jobs they can have. The country is divided into 12 districts all with their own 'duties' for the government such as the fishing district, the technology district, and the coal district, District 12. The people of the districts live in poverty and their world feels more like the time of the early industrial revolution mixed with oppressed Europe where people were first and foremost, laborers.<br /><br />The citizens of Panem grow up in a world where starvation is a regular occurrence and talk against the government is punishable by death. Every year, the government forces all the people of Panem to attend the \\"reapings\\" where one boy and one girl ages 12-18 are chosen from each district to enter the Hunger Games arena (24 kids in total)and fight to the death. When Katniss' younger sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers herself to go in, knowing full well that there is a very good chance she'll never come home. What she doesn't know, is that Peeta, the boy chosen from her district who will enter the arena with her as her enemy, has some secrets of his own that will change everything for Katniss and the citizens of Panem forever.<br /><br />What I was most surprised to find in this novel was that through all the violence and sadness, there was a great deal of love. Love of family, of friends and on a romantic level as well. The series has the fighting spirit of the oppressed, something that I loved about the Harry Potter series which is executed wonderfully in this series as the books go on. You find yourself caught up in an engrossing story and world, to the point where you're almost certain Panem actually does exist!<br /><br />As someone with a degree in Mass Media Communications, I found this book absolutely fascinating. Not just from the standpoint of the amazing, imaginative and captivating story but also because of how it reflects on society and the role that entertainment and media play in our lives.<br /><br />A futuristic and brutal gladiator tale where children are forced to kill or be killed in an around the clock nation-wide broadcast, how could the story not bring to mind the current obsession with reality television? Not only that, but also the media's preoccupation with celebrities, not able to get enough of their personal lives. The contests of the Hunger Games are huge celebrities throughout Panem but mostly in the nations Capitol, the most lavish, well-fed and 'modern' district. As more children are sent off to die each year in front of the entire nation, the people of Panem are growing increasingly hostile towards their government and whispers of change are going around. Completely cut off from one another, the districts know only what the government wants them to know but when the Hunger Games are broadcast live, they may learn more than the government ever intended.<br /><br />Read these books today, I promise, you won't be disappointed!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|With all of the positive reviews I thought I'd give this mic a try for some video work. I received the first mic and couldn't get it to work on any device or the computer. Okay, fair enough, these things happen. Received the second mic... same problem. The mic itself feel incredibly cheap and obviously has shoddy craftsmanship. I guess you get what you pay for...
B000002O1Q|5.0|Bought for my boyfriend, he loves this cd, and continously plays it over and over again, this is the background music for an 80's movie, which I saw and would probably see again.
B001GCUO16|5.0|\\"X-Men Origins Wolverine\\" is a cool movie. This movie depicts how Logan became Wolverine. This movie's action scenes are a lot better than the X-Men films. When people are fighting you feel like the cast and crew put a lot of work in it. When I watched the X-Men films I didn't feel that way. Continuing on the sound, acting, and other movie related things were good. The special features are interesting and cool to watch. There's also a digital copy disc. I give \\"X-Men Origins Wolverine\\" BD an A rating.
B004US4K2C|5.0|I cannot in good faith recommend getting it from Amazon. The devs of this app update it regularly, and Amazon is notoriously TERRIBLE about updating. If Amazon was on the ball as far as updating their apps go, this would be a great download via amazon, but I personally will stick to my android market version.<br /><br /> The Launcher is one of the most customizable, has a TON of themes on the market, and eats way less battery than either sense or motoblur.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|\\"The Expendables\\" is about Barney Ross(Sylvester Stallone) leading a group of mercenaries in accomplishing missions they're assigned or missions they want to accomplish. It's cool to see all these action stars come together and make a movie. Everything about this movie is great ranging from the acting, music, and all those other things within a movie. There are special features with this BD version. The special features are good to watch because you get to see how the movie was made, the challenges faced, and other movie process things.
B00138JBMG|5.0|The 1986 release The Ultimate Sin, saw both Ozzy Osbourne and legendary guitarist Jake E. Lee at a crossroads in thier professional carreers. Ozzy was at the hieght of his battle with alcoholism and abusive behavior. Lee was annoyed and concerned about Ozzy's situation, as Lee had always been the consummate professional. The albums title track is hard-driving and showcases Lee's use of complex arrangements. He continued his penchant for virtuoisitic guitar playing on Killer Of Giants, showcasing Lee's classically inspired guitar training which he shared with former roomate Warren De Martini from Ratt. Adding to the bands effort are Phil Soussan on bass and now deceased Randy Castillo on drums, who shines on the recording, although his playing is sometimes muddied through the masterings modualtion. On the other hand, The Ulmate Sin also contained Ozzy's biggest hit to date, Shot In The Dark, charting at #6 on the Billboard Charts. Strangely, Ozzy said that he hated the song, I feel this is mostly due to the fact that Ozzy felt betrayed by Jake when he decided to leave the band. In addition, Ozzy is strongly influenced by his wife Sharon, who recently had the performances of drummer Lee Kerslake and bassist Bob Daisley removed from Blizzard Of Ozz and Dairy Of A Madman. Such petty behavior is unfortunate but a reality in the world. Regardless, Lee went on to start a new band, Badlands(1989), although the album only managed Gold sales(500,000). Ozzy recruited a young,eager, and talented Zakk Wylde, who brought Ozzy to the height of his success with No More Tears(1991). This album, along with Bark At The Moon, are must haves for any fan of superlative guitar work. Lee's solo on Bark At The Moon is especially memorable.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I wouldn't pay over $100 for this box set but I'm very happy getting it through Amazon for $54.  Considering that each season itself is usually over $20.   The box set is a big book with pictures and 28 DVDs. Awesome presentation.  If you're a fan of The O.C., I believe it's worth getting even though it's not Blu-Ray.
B00123KEX2|5.0|In 1980, Van Halen released a great album of enduring quality, capturing the bands unnerving youth and playfulness. Especially on tracks like Could This Be Magic?, a decidedly FUN song capturing David Lee Roth's wise-ass mentality and fondness for the female form. Roth and Eddie Van Halen trade off complex melodies, both insturmental and vocal, and also whimiscal nostalgia for an age long gone. In A Simple Rhyme is a great track with clever and retrospective lyrics, in addition, some angelic vocal harmonies from Micheal Anthony. Tora, Tora, Tora and Loss Of Control are blistering tracks from Eddie and Alex, fast moving and unrelenting in nature. And The Cradle Will Rock and Everybody Wants Some are tracks that encapsulate adult concerns and irritations, Roth again showing his wiley and astute obervations on the human psyche. Take Your Whiskey Home is a prelude to some of Metallicas riffige many years after Women And Childrens release. This album is at the pinnicle of Van Halen's creativity and youthfulness. Eddie later commented that the making of the album was fun, loose and contained many early morning hours using Jack Daniels and Vodka as inspirations. Highly Recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really enjoy the fame. Easy to pick up, difficult to master. Even my kids enjoy it. Would recommendation to anyone.
B000002H6C|5.0|In this Progressive Metal masterpiece, Metallica displays their individual technical prowess and incorporate politics,cynacism and rage, following the death of their former bassist, Cliff Burton, who does contribute to Metallica's last great insturmental, To Live Is To Die. Every song on this album is killer. Lars Ulrich's drumming is superb if not phenominal. I remember reading a review that was critical of his playing and sound. I find these comments to be absurd. His drum sound, in my humble opinion, is the BEST of his stellar career. I LOVE the way the bass drum hits my speakers on tracks like, Blackened(One of Metallica's best), And Justice For All..., The Shortest Straw, and Dyers Eve, it reminds me of the work of Neil Peart on my favorite Rush track Red Barchetta, or Megadeth's Holy Wars...The Punishment Due from Rust In Peace. James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett are also devastating on the album. Hetfield's chainsaw riffs and cynical vocals echo adolescent rage and determination. This album just happens to be a favorite of the members of our Special Forces for obvious reasons. I feel that the album provides a case study in tight, harmonic, and brutal riffing, which was undoubtedly Metallica's aim when making Justice. Unfortunately, Metallica was famously robbed by the Grammy's, who gave the 1988 Album Of The Year nod to the washed up Jethro Tull, showing the BS present in the Grammy World. Metallica not only showcase their playing ability on this album, but also what I consider a distinctively American brand of rage and machismo. This record like Rush's A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres is a MUST HAVE for ANY fan of Progressive Metal.
0385534639|3.0|Truth be told: this story could have been written in less than 100 pages. The plot was simplistic and anticlimatic. The conclusion just a bit too easily resolved for my taste. But I will read more from Ms. Morgenstern.<br /><br />Because the entire book tasted like honey.<br /><br />I'm serious; if you buy a copy of \\"The Night Circus\\" and lick the cover, it would be sweet. This book is beautiful writing at its finest, with amazing word choice and descriptions galore. it makes me pity my circus-less childhood. it makes me pity the world because Le Cirque des Rêves is only a figment of the author's imagination. It makes me pity myself, because the only way for me to experience Le Cirque is through the printed words across the page.<br /><br />Reading this book was like dreaming.<br /><br />Quite apt, since Le Cirque des Rêves translates to the Circus of Dreams. However, if the entire novel was one long dream, it would be a very jarring and bumpy dream rather than a smooth one. For some odd reason, Ms. Morgenstern felt the need to jump from here to there to some other place and then back again in her narrative. It's like living some sort of weird parallel life at five different instances in time all at once. This contributes to the lack of tension in the novel, too. Whenever we get to the high point of a chapter, all of it suddenly disappears as we jump to another time or place with another set of characters.<br /><br />Knowing what I do now about \\"The Night Circus\\" and its plot imperfections, I would still have read it. If only to walk through Les Cirque des Rêves through the characters. if only to visit the Ice Garden and the Anthologies of Memory and the Cloud Maze through another's eyes.

0385732554|1.0|This review will be short and sweet. This book is terrible. Gave you enough to be interested and left you hanging at the end. I honestly didn't find the \\"release\\" part as bad as the Hunger Games in which they put teenagers in an arena to kill each other, but that's me! Would not recommend to kids as the others have said. Was so disappointed in the end I was actually mad. I hate when I invest time into a book and the end just stinks. Wish I had the past few hours back!! Ugh!!

0061655546|5.0|Some things - namely, greed and reckless behavior - never change. The leveraged buyout (LBO) of RJR Nabisco occurred in the late 1980s, but the 20th anniversary edition of this classic tale of excess reads as if it were reported and written today. Money-hungry CEO Ross Johnson and power-grabbing financier Henry Kravis remain relevant archetypes of their times. Journalists Bryan Burrough and John Helyar vividly capture the behind-the-scenes maneuvering in the deal of the decade. getAbstract especially enjoyed the update on Johnson, Kravis and the rest, and recommends this book to those seeking a revelatory, page-turning account of high-profile greed.

0385474547|5.0|Great book.  She loved it.  It was recommended by my daughter's English High School teacher.  She would recommend it to others to read.
0545123291|4.0|I really liked Shiver and Linger is even better. The author is getting a lot better with the switching viewpoints. The addition of new characters makes it seem fresh. Isabel is my favorite. She's hilarious, witty, and clearly damaged by the events of Shiver, but she still doesn't take any crap from Cole. There are genuinely laugh out loud moments in Linger, more so than Shiver. The dialogue is sharp. The relationships move at a believable pace.<br /><br /> Surprisingly, I really like Cole even though he's an arrogant, angry, lost little boy. Its to the author's credit that she can create characters so multi-dimensional that you forgive Cole's (and Isabel's) flaws and like him (her) anyway.<br /><br />I'm still not sure what purpose Shelby serves, if any at all. There's potential there for a really interesting character and some really good storytelling. Her presence in the novel comes and goes and is kind of jarring, because its not really necessary to tell anything from her POV but the author does it anyway. I'm hoping there's a Shelby payoff in Forever.<br /><br />The snapshots of Sam's life with the pack, specifically Ulrik and Beck are very well done. They don't take over the main story, but provide a nice backdrop of family ties and loss. You can really see what Sam's lost, and how it colors his decisions throughout the book.<br /><br />I read this one in one sitting, same as Shiver. The pacing is great and I couldn't sleep without knowing how it ended. Overall, this is a VERY solid series and I hope there will be more than just 3 books.

B0052WSX32|5.0|This new release by Doris Day is truly an amazing collection of  songs by the most gifted and talented lady this world has ever known. I can't stop listening to YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. I  have never heard this song sung with such feeling and warmth. It now belongs to Doris. All of the unreleased cuts are wonderful. THE WAY I DREAMED IT and DISNEY GIRLS are pure Doris and MY HEART, well there are no words to describe the beauty of her singing this  emotional piece of music. There are other great singers such as Streisand but they sing for the world. Doris sings just for you. A rare gift that no one has come near matching. Other singers say hey look I'm singing but with Doris it just comes as a natural part of her being. The song HAPPY ENDINGS sung and co-written by her son is to quote Paul Brogan, HAUNTING. It will make you cry as well as make you smile. If only we could go back to that wonderful time. Maybe, Doris will bring it all back. I adore this special LADY.
0385534639|3.0|Just wondering whether this is a knock-off the excellent HBO historical supernatural series Carnivale, which focused on semi-divine beings with special powers, the \\"good\\" one of whom was in a travelling circus. Seems like this is the same permise.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|People need to get over themselves, If you hate these movies on blu-ray so much then get out your VHS tapes, grab your extra large popcorn, your bottle of milk, your dirty diaper, your rattle, and quit acting like a 2 year old child just because some furry creature blinks. As far as I am concerned these movies are pretty dang good and anyone who is considering buying these movies because they enjoy star wars should go ahead and get them and if anyone tells you otherwise they can just shut their mouth
B004EPZ070|5.0|I saw part of this on a flight to Houston so I had to see the entire movie. Loved all of the characters. You could feel the struggle of the love triangle. Some feel this is a morals issue but gee look at so many other movies out there that could be judged the same way. Believe it or not this could happen and probably has. Love Kate Hudson in any movie. Ginnifer Goodwin is adorable and John Krasinski is a funny guy. Then there is handsome Colin Egglesfield with those gorgeous eyes.

B000CRKW9A|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Before there was Requiem for a Dream, there was Last Exit to Brooklyn (based on Hubert Selby Jr's other main novel) which deals with post-WWII Brooklyn in all of its scuzzy former glory; mixing different protagonists and different stories--from a jaded hooker without a heart of gold to a closeted Union big wheel to a wonderfully kinetic and exciting fight scene between strikers and strikebreakers--leads to some structural problems, but it's a movie you won't forget.     3.5/4

The first time I owned it (2009)I put it in my DVD player and could not stop listening to it for almost 2 months. I recently repurchased it and it arrived maybe 3 weeks ago. I haven't been able to stop playing it yet. It's like the first time all over again. It's amazing how one album can have this much great music on it. Every song has become my favorite song! I have it on repeat, and it's just a never ending wave of great music in my house. I LOVE IT! Do yourself a favor.......buy it now!

B005M2A4DE|4.0|I'm sure that I will be blasted by the company trolls, who respond with the trite response of \\"Comment on products that you own.\\"    I love Doctor Who, the Sixth season, where I've been waiting for the complete series Blu-ray release!  I had hoped that the complete series release wouldn't be so costly, as the sixth season has Part 1 and Part 2 releases.  The BBC, however, is following the formula of other movie and TV studios where we're being asked to pay a price as if the sixth season had never been released yet!  (If you don't believe me, look at how the Blu-ray releases of The Lord of the Rings theatrical and extended movies were priced when first released.)    Are the complete series extras really worth the additional $30 price tag?!?  (Subjective question here, especially for you company trolls.)  If you do pre-order this, then you'll hopefully be rewarded in future as your purchase generates revenues to keep paying for the production costs of Doctor Who.  At least, that's what I believe.    If the pre-order price was lower, I'd give my review 5 stars.
B000XR4OC0|3.0|\\"One-for-one,\\" I like that phrase but is the shoe really worth it?  A year ago I bought my first pair of Toms.  My first pair of Toms was the classic black slip-on and they cost $47.80.  After paying this amount for these shoes I don't agree that the price for these shoes is appropriate. They should be priced at $10.  I definitely didn't hesitate to buy these shoes because Toms donates a pair of shoes when you buy a pair of shoes, so who wouldn't buy these shoes, right?  That was my mistake. I better off donating money for food than these shoes.<br /> Bobs are better quality and they last longer, my sisters shoes have lasted longer than my newer Toms. Toms are too expensive for a shoe that falls apart on the first month. There is a hole where my big toe is, the back of the shoe is undone and ripped already, and the sole of the shoe is ridiculously poor quality. The sole of the shoe is the worst part of the shoe.  It is so thin and smooth that causes slips and falls all the time, well at least to me. They should never be worn on rainy days!  Apart from the sole, the quality itself sucks. The shoe fades within the first 5 months; I washed mine because the inside of the shoe started to smell and the shoes faded form black to dark gray.  The inside of the shoe starts to smell if regular socks aren't worn or even athleta flat socks. It's really bad.<br />  On the other, Toms are very comfortable and stylish. They pretty much go with everything casual. You can wear them with a plain t-shirt and pants or even to a formal event like a wedding.  That's kind of a trend now a day. I wore mine black glittery Toms to prom like many that night and my feet were very satisfied.  Plus, Toms go with any gender, age, and style.  After a workout, Toms are very cozy to wear.  After all they are very lightweight.<br /> If you just want a causal pair of shoes (not to be worn on wet surfaces or used for anything else other than walking) then they are fair shoes. If you are a mom looking for a sturdy and durable pair of shoes for your child that will last at least a school year, you are better off buying a pair of shoes at Payless.  However, I am not saying you shouldn't buy these shoes; I am simply going off by my own experience, my friends and family. Think twice before you buy and go to a store first to check them out, and then make your decision about getting them.<br /><br />K.

B00006EXDM|4.0|Not to be overly dramatic regarding chronology, but IMHO \\"The Last Time\\", & \\"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby (Standing In The Shadows) should absolutely have been in this set, not the Fazed Cookies compilation. I realize it's a 'whatever' issue, as you could easily burn your own collection in any order you chose, but to an old 60's dog, this album(s) would have had a better flow with them.

B004IJZFP4|5.0|I remembered Tommy Bolin's work from back in the 70's - a fine guitarist with a couple of pretty good albums. I never saw him live in the Pacific NW (Seattle). Then a couple of year's ago I heard a cut from the Ebbett's Field disc on satellite radio and got taken in by what a great guitarist he really was when he stretched out. I have picked up a lot of the Archive recordings - really good work with pretty adequate recording quality. But this is special. If you like jam band music (I do) and want to hear what Umphrey's McGee, Moe and Widespread Panic (with Jimmy Herring) are doing today but few people could touch 35 years ago, this is a quality recording with the kind of stuff that never survived onto major label studio albums back in the day.    Great stuff...

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I'm so glad that Nyko came out with this product!  Living in a small apartment, using the Kinect was almost impossible.  It required rearranging all of the furniture in the room, and still we'd have to back up all the way to the wall in order to use it.      The Zoom has worked great!  We can finally use our Kinect without the workout of room-rearrangement.  The Kinect was just collecting dust, but now we'll be getting much more use out of it!

B002VL3R1K|3.0|Sometimes I just get the idea into my mind to read totalitarian ideology.  Just like dystopian literature it can be enlightening to put your worldview up against those which flatly reject what one's society puts forth.  After briskly reading through the Communist Manifesto I decided to tackle a work which had held my interest for some time.  The work of course was Mein Kampf, the semi-autobiography/propaganda work by one of history's justifiably infamous despots.    Actually the book was at times mental torture.  It is long, tedious in places, and reading over too much of its content in one afternoon could get my head literally aching.  That said the historical fascination drove me onwards.  Although rather weary at the end I am rather glad I took the time to read it.    Hitler discusses his early life, his failure as an artist, the shaping of his ideology, a few of his World War I experiences, and the rise of the Nazi party preceeding the failed coup at Munich.  As the forward and page notes point out however, not all of this information is conveyed accurately by the author (big surprise).    The book does not lay out a clear and carefully laid out explanation of Nazi ideology.  This is not surprising.  Hitler was not yet in power.  His ideas may not have fully solidified if they ever did.  Nazism like most large movements was far from monolithic but instead composed of the ideas of individuals from sometimes hostile viewpoints. There are some disturbing hints of things to come however.  Hitler's racism and anti-semitism are raw, paranoid, and clearly set forth.  So is a perverse utilitarian concept which would culminate in the forced sterilization or murder of the mentally handicapped.  The enmity towards France and the goal of expanding German influence in the east present forshadows of the wars which were to come.  Hitler's religious ideology remains rather an enigma.  He does make a number of references to religion in his book but as Abraham Foxman points out in the introduction there is evidence Hitler was privately opposed to Christian belief.  Even from the public veneer presented in Mein Kampf it seems clear that his religious beliefs (if he had them) were not what was really motivating him.  Apart from anti-semitism, pro-German racism, and a somewhat more justified fear of Marxism, another strain of thought runs through the work.  This was a particularly ruthless strain of Social Darwinism.  Hitler clearly had a predatory mind which was extended to the worth of human beings.  Hitler may have been insane; I do not know for certain.  He was clearly evil though.    So what can I say in summation.  Should I recommend this book?  That depends.  If you have his sorts of tendencies, please do not read this book to reinforce them.  If you are simply interested in history, Mein Kampf might be worth your time but remember that it is how Hitler wanted to present himself and is not entirely accurate.  This book might be a pain to struggle through.  You might find it disturbing.  Hopefully you will.  Nazism really was a revolutionary ideology but in nearly all the wrong ways.  Just like totalitarian communism the result was the deaths of millions.  This book is fascinating, informative, tedious, and frankly presents very evil ideas.  It can and has influenced people in very terrible ways.    If you choose to read do so at your own caution.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|Fans of Anthrax have been waiting for this for a long time, whether it was going to be John Bush, Dan Nelson, or who it ended up being, Joey Belladonna.  The music has been sitting on a shelf ripening, and now it has been picked and never sounded better. I truly loved their last album We've Come For You All, and this picks right up in excellent song craftsmanship.  The track listing is as Amazon lists, but the package of the album (digipack format) only lists 11 tracks, it does not count the Hymn 1 and Hymn 2.  Also, as a bonus track, hidden after Revolution Screams is The Refused cover tune \\"New Noise\\".  I received this yesterday from a pre-order, and have had time to digest this album through twice now, and I really like every track, but to pick favorites, In The End, Crawl, and The Constant. This is the heavier stuff on the album, with constant having a flair for acoustic contrast.  The guitars just slice thick in songs Like The end, and Crawl is just infectious.  Charlie pounds on the Drums like nobodies business on the whole album, and the bass is just grinding. I must give this easily a 5 star review without blinking, and recommend that regardless of what era of Anthrax you like, I think all can agree that this is a great album, even for newcomers.  Update 10-4-11: I recieved the Japanese edition of this album today, has the same first 13 tracks as the US, but then the 14th track is Crawl Orchestral Mix, a very nice version of that song. It reminds me a bit of the re-mixes of Black Lodge on the Black Lodge single, with the quiet to loud contrasting nicely in parts.  The Japanese release does not contain the hidden track New Noise.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Thanks to the author and the screenwriter, the story is real good. No matter how many legal thriller you had watched before, you would still be captivated by the first ten minutes depicting what type of trade \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is in, and watch on, thanks to the very charming McConaughey and the excellent supporting cast. There are a few obvious flaws in the plot, a great entertainment nevertheless. Highly recommended!
0765326353|5.0|I, like many of Sanderson's readers, discovered a new great fantasy author when he picked up the Wheel of Time series where Robert Jordan left off. I love the WOT and I love Sanderson's additions to the series (especially Towers of Midnight) and I enjoyed the Mistborn Trilogy, even if I didn't love it. So I was cautiously optimistic when picked up The Way of Kings. I was on vacation with my family and I thought it would be a good beach read. However, I soon put it away in favor of The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothsfuss (another great book). I wanted very badly to like the first book of Sanderson's epic trilogy, but I was having a hard time getting into it. The problem is that Sanderson throws you right into the middle of his fantasy world. I felt lost and confused by the creatures, the characters, and the very world that he described. I had to remind myself that it wasn't until my third attempt that I finally got into Robert Jordan's The Eye of the World, so I forced my way through the first 200 or so pages of this book. Finally, I began to get a grip on the world that Sanderson created and even if I was still a little confused, I began to get pulled into the characters. Once I did, I couldn't put the book down - I wanted to know whether Dalinar would be able to create some semblance of order amongst the aristocracy and what would happen next to the fatally lucky/unlucky Kaladin! Everything comes together as you read the book - the history of the Sanderson's world, the magic, the characters, and the threats that they all face. I can't wait for the next book in this series - I think I might actually be looking forward to it more than the conclusion of the WOT!
B002RSDW8A|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Julia in this movie. Julie was \\"eh\\" and the whiney-ness got a little old. But Meryl Streep nailed Julia and I loved her performance. She was funny and quirky and vulnerable but still strong. I think I'll go watch it again.
0553386794|4.0|I watched the HBO series prior to reading this book, so I had an idea of what to expect.  The tv series deviated a tiny bit from the book, but I like the way all the different characters' point of views were presented in chapters. There's not much I can say other than this is a typical medieval epic. It's a long read and I don't want to spend the money and time toward reading three more books. I think watching the series will suffice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this in less than two days. I couldn't put it down. I'm 28, so I didn't expect a \\"YA\\" book to keep me engaged. I imagined it would have cheesy moments to it like Twilight, etc. I also like the author having the guts to write a story about young adults with grit and not apologizing for it.
B0052SNP1G|4.0|Those listeners already familiar with Tim Bowness, No-Man, No Sound, or Giancarlo Erra probably already have a feeling about what they are going to get when they first hear Memories of Machines' excellent debut project Warm Winter. Because mostly it's a continuation of what those men and their other groups are all about. And on this recording they have a lot of support from some of the biggest names in modern prog.<br />Though it took me a little while to warm to this, I eventually did in a big way. Tim Bowness' vocals are an acquired taste but after years of listening to him, I recognize that they are a perfect fit for the kind of music he makes. Another reviewer describes them as \\"hushed\\". Perfect. You might also describe them as breathless. And here with Giancarlo Erra, he hones them to near perfection.<br />My favorite cuts and to me the best compositions on the album are Before We Fall and Change Me Once Again. But I also really enjoy the title cut, Something In Our Lives, and a fine rendition of No-Man's Schoolyard Ghosts. About the only ones that really don't touch me are Lost and Found In The Digital World and the short piece which introduces the album.<br />The CD comes housed in a six-panel gatefold case and is accompanied by an attractive and very useful booklet containing the lyrics. All other info is provided on one of the interior panels. If you are looking for some new music to which you can mellow down easy, then you ought to consider Warm Winter. It's well worth hearing again and again.
B005974CDU|2.0|I have to admit I did not have high hopes for this latest DT album. I received my pre-order downloadable CD yesterday and have listened to it front to back many times now. I like it a lot more than Black Clouds but not as much as Octavarium. Octavarium and Image and Words are my favorite albums. The standouts on this album for me are Bridges in the sky, Far from heaven and This is the life. Far from heaven Is going to be the song that the hardcore fans will bash. It's a ballad, but it's a great ballad. I really hope this one makes the set list on the tour. The last album, black clouds and silver linings was mired in the \\"look at what I can do\\" over the top virtuoso playing and at some point it all melds together into a bunch of electronic chatter without distinction. Not to mention the music and lyrics did not cater to James awesome voice. This new album is similar but I'm still very excited about the upcoming tour.<br /><br />Update 10-3-2011<br />This has been losing my interest the longer I listen to it. I just saw them in concert and it was good but all of the new songs seemed to be to long. Long for the sake of being long wears me down. It becomes uninteresting. It's even more evident when listening in shuffle mode. Songs like Scarred, Octavarium, Lines in the sand and A change of seasons are all very long songs and they are over before you know it. but then Songs like Outcry, Breaking all illusions, and Lost but not forgotten get mixed in and it's quite noticeable how long they are. I find my self being done with these songs after about 5 minutes and skip to the next song. I hope they try something completely different on the next album. It's funny, I received [[ASIN:B005CM9DX6 Heritage]] by Opeth around the same time and they released an album almost opposite of what they were known for and I'm loving it!. It was Unexpected, Brave, and refreshing. Instead of making another \\"doom\\" album they took a risk by making an old school prog rock album and in my opinion it paid off big!<br /><br />It's time for Dream Theater to take some risks.ig!  It's time for Dream Theater to take some risks.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|REASONS TO BUY THIS ALBUM:<br /><br />- You bought the first two albums by Lady Antebellum.  Why stop now?  \\"Third time's a charm\\" as the saying goes...<br /><br />- Truth be told you liked the first album, you loved the second album, and you've been stalking the third album for some time now.  You haven't actually heard it yet but you're convinced that this will be the one you finally settle down and make babies with.  You're done with \\"American Honey\\" and now you want The American Dream - you and the third Lady Antebellum record living in a little house with a white picket fence and an appropriate amount of consumer debt.<br /><br />- You are still a fan of the long-running international-smash-hit reality television show AMERICAN IDOL and you feel that Scotty and Lauren Alaina's duet on \\"American Honey\\"  was one of the contestant performance highlights of the season (if not the entire series).<br /><br />- You love country music, but if you have to make a choice between Hank and Lefty or contemporary crossover superstars like Faith and Shania, you will always choose Faith and Shania (after wondering to yourself who \\"Hank and Lefty\\" are).<br /><br />- Faith and Shania are great but the kind of contemporary crossover act that really gets your juices flowing is a two guys on one girl 3some with alternating male/female vocals - a sort of leaner, cleaner, country flavored Fleetwood Mac type situation (with or without the real life romance).<br /><br />-  You like lady singers that sound a little like Natalie Maines and look even sexier.  Someone with bedroom eyes and for whom a long, dreamy, Antebellum-like ball gown is not out of the question.<br /><br />- You like your male singers in George Michaelish facial hair and looking like the love child of Kiefer Sutherland and Ryan Gosling - with a bit of Neil Diamond's vocal drama thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />- if Jay Leno caught you on the street and asked you on camera to define the word \\"Antebellum\\" you would probably say something that would cause the studio audience to laugh...but don't worry, it's not an obvious enough question that he would ever ask that...and does he even do that \\"Jaywalking\\" thing anymore anyway?<br /><br />(Full/sheepish disclosure:  I had to look up \\"Antebellum\\" and I was an English major - how many of you can define it?)<br /><br />- The following album statistics sound good to you:<br /><br />Faster Songs = 5<br />Slower Songs = 7<br />Awesome songs = 7<br />Decent songs = 5<br />Countryish songs = 2<br />Pop/rock songs = 10<br /><br />- You're still reading this?

Click \\"Add to Cart\\" or \\"Buy This With 1-Click\\" already - it's time to get your Top 40 groove on...augh...but don't worry, it's not an obvious enough question that he would ever ask that...and does he even do that \\"Jaywalking\\" thing anymore anyway?    (Full/sheepish disclosure:  I had to look up \\"Antebellum\\" and I was an English major - how many of you can define it?)    - The following album statistics sound good to you:    Faster Songs = 5  Slower Songs = 7  Awesome songs = 7  Decent songs = 5  Countryish songs = 2  Pop/rock songs = 10    - You're still reading this?

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Wow. I have been watching Fringe since season 1 and have boughten all of them and will do so for season 4 as well. ( and hopefully the show will continue on to a 5th and 6th season!)   Fringe is THE MOST creative, fascinating, and well made show EVER.  I honestly would like anyone who HAS SEEN the show (it can't just be somebody who has watched one episode and thinks they can judge the show) and thinks there is a better sci-fi episodic tv show to let me know because I will watch it and give it a good fair chance if this person still thinks it is better than Fringe.  I doubt any show is better though.  Fringe is the perfect blend of real science and technology with riveting fiction that captures the viewers attention and leaves them hooked, wanting to watch the next episode, and then the next.   J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, the creators of Fringe, put more work and detail into this show than any other show I've seen.  First of all, they have the observer walking in the background of various scenes, sometimes even so small or for so quick an instant that you have to press pause on your remote to spot him.  The creators also slip in almost unnoticeable clues that relate to the current or future episodes, like a number on a license plate of a random person or a word on a coffee mug that an agent is drinking out of.  The observers and these clues blend into the show as if they were just chosen randomly for background purposes or props but in reality everything is so carefully thought out.  It makes one really appreciate the work that is being put into the show.  All the small details that many people who watch the show probably don't pick up on or notice at all and never will.  There are so many easter eggs (that's what fan sites call the clues) in each episode that I probably have missed a few things myself.  It just shows you how much the creators care about the show, that they are willing to think of small fun details, even when there is a good chancemost people won't even see them.  They also have Fringe glyphs before each commercial break (you can find a translator for these glyphs on the internet) and each glyph stands for a letter.  And by the end of the episode, you have a word that relates to the show or the current episode or again a clue for the next one.  None of these little extras are crucial to your understanding of the show, they are just exciting freebies that help the viewer feel more involved in the show and it creates kind of a personal interest in the plot.  Season 3 is definitely my favorite season of the series.  It is by far the most suspenseful and exciting set of episodes so far, in my opinion.  But actually this is all in my opinion haha:)  p.s. a really good website for it you want to follow along with all the Fringe easter eggs and just general fringy talk is [...]
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book (actually, all three from this series) is most enjoyable. Larsson does a fantastic job of creating vivid imagery in his characters.  He writes in a way that you feel connected to the characters, almost as if you know them personally.<br /><br />Easy page turner even being my first Kindle read (which I also love BTW).  It is unfortunate that Larsson is no longer with us, as I crave more of his writing. Buy the book, you won't be disappointed.
B004VUP8WK|5.0|Most people are killing this record,,I for one love it,,been a morbid angel fan since the release of blessed,,aside from maybe 2 tracks i think this record is amazing,,,I feel like most of the people who are bashing this album are just hardcore death metal fans who want a brutal all blast beats record, the hardcore people wont like this record but i think its one of their best,just as good as covenant and domination,,  so if your looking for that fast paced all blastbeat fastest thing you have ever heard,, this record is not what ya want,,if you enjoy some quality well written hard songs,.,,it kills,
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I would've bought this blu ray even if it didnt have any special added features (which, by the way, are all great anyway). This movie is GREAT FUN with some hilarious laughs and some touching moments as well. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring the top level Brit flavoured comedy, bridging that with crass South Parkian-type humour as well. Doesnt get any better than that. Sigourney Weaver kicks ass in a featured role. But the stand-out here is Kristin Wiig. This movie (as well as her other already-classic, \\"Bridesmaids\\") is sure to catapult her into that rare, unique class of classic female comedy actresses/writers. She wont have any problem crossing over into dramatic parts as well. Big things already in store for her.<br />This one gets 5 BIG stars. PICK IT UP cause I guarantee you'll be watching this one repeatedly without getting tired of it.
1936719118|5.0|This book is perfect if your looking for how to start a new business or a better way run one you already have. It can also help you with just daily life! These principles the author gives have been extremely helpful and inspiring to me. Especially the parts that deal with making decisions for the right reasons.<br />Don't do things out of greed.<br />Instead do them to help others<br />One of the examples the author gives is \\"the real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy\\". This is just one of the many examples of the good advice he gives in this great book. Its awesome! Definitely a good read for anyone looking for a good start toward something great. Another book that goes well with this one would be [[ASIN:193671924X Zarrella's Hierarchy of Contagiousness: The Science, Design, and Engineering of Contagious Ideas]].These two books can give you a great jump start towards your your new business or new start at life.

B004I11VZ0|5.0|The story line continues from Ip Man (1st movie) but the action is unbelievable. The fight on the table top between two masters was absolutely wonderful. I do recommend this movie.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|Having listened to all the tracks i can honestly say i was saddened that this was an official new release from this amazing artist. Ive been following Yanni since Optimystique and i just couldn't feel the connection. I wasn't even sure i was listening to a Yanni album. I think the issue is that Yanni's signature keyboard sound that he has used on many albums now is now different and the sound i had become accustomed to and loved is now no longer present. I hope Yanni will reconsider and go back to his old \\"sound\\". That being said it is nice that he is trying new things but i just didn't feel the emotion and energy from this piece of work.
B003INBOE2|5.0|I love the action and storyline of this movie which centers on the Teacher/Master of Bruce Lee. You will not be disappointed if you purchase it.

B003L77GRO|5.0|A new season, just like a new book, about Dexter or by his dear author, are treats that have the essence of pleasure and the texture of bliss and happiness. This fifth season is no exception especially with the final image of the previous season of Dexter's son, Harrison, in the blood of his mother and wife, respectively and backwardly, killed by the Trinity Killer just before he was abducted and liquidated if not terminated by Dexter who did not know what this trinity Killer had just done.<br /><br />From this traumatic scene opening this season we move onto another serial killer or rather a gang of serial killers who have been operating since high school or so and are still operating under the supervision and guidance of a TV positive thinker, one of these new prophets of the post-God era. These gurus who more or less mesmerize their clients into doing what they, the gurus, want them, the clients, to do in their, the guru's, places. It is tempting to have an inner circle of disciples with whom you share your real power, I mean the guru has the full power and the others execute the deepest bleakest darkest blackest desires the guru has and has been able to suggest or extract from the unconscious minds of the followers.<br /><br />It sounds religious, Christian in fact, but they push slightly further the parallelism and that gang of If-you-want-something-take-it-ters project the Christian nature onto their victims who are sacrificed in the perfect number of thirteen, the thirteenth victim evading the lot and the curse, so that we drop back to twelve, the proper number with the thirteenth traitor who will turn against the guru, and will be coming back with a dark angel to execute and terminate all the members of that gang, one by one. In fact it is even more vicious because the first victim has been mesmerized into accepting her link with the guru and she survived. That makes fourteen victims, the first surviving like a sort of Holy Virgin and even helping along, twelve dead after torture and a few other niceties, the last one surviving and treacherously coming back to bring justice, like the archangel Gabriel, the executor of God's sentences, with I guess the archangel Michael, the liquidator of dragons.<br /><br />This series does not work as a common thriller and what is important is not to learn who the real criminal is, why Dexter is going to execute this one or that one. We know that straight away, from the very start. The point here is to know how Dexter is going to get out of the intricate complicated and very obscure and precarious situations he is putting himself in. And this season is great as for that. But I am not going to reveal these details.<br /><br />What is more interesting is that the thirteenth victim and Dexter are going to be fellow-travelers on the dark passage of the dark passenger. But is it going to be the meeting of one's life time or is it going to be transient and evanescent? Is she going to be the new woman in his life? On the other side Harrison has to be taken care of and he is growing. The problem is the nanny because he needs a nanny since his grand parents have taken the other older two children and can't take this one, and since Deborah has a full time job at the Miami Metropolitan Police. But that's a small complication in the life of a really busy young man who has two professions, both exacting and demanding.<br /><br />The best part of this series is that we have divided loyalties. We are absolutely on the side of the police and Deborah who are for catching criminals and bringing them to justice, but at the same time we are absolutely behind Dexter who considers that we are supposed to save tax payer money and avoid bringing those criminals to justice. But, if we are for that kind of a twist in the fabric of justice and law-enforcement, we are well obliged to be on the side of the small or big twists in police work to simplify a situation that is too complicated for a colleague, who is innocent of course of any crime, just awkwardly compromised by his or her lack of swiftness, or to decide to let some criminals run because they are just cleaning up the dirty place in which we live and this is ethical, cheap and efficacious. What's more it attacks most of the time, in this case particularly, people who have the necessary means to have the best lawyers and evade criminal justice like a certain DSK in New York.<br /><br />One thing is sure: quite a few people disappear in the USA without leaving any tracks or footprints behind and no one seems to care about it, provided these disappearing characters are proved vicious criminals of any type. This seems to reveal something about the American-ness of this series. The objective is to catch the criminals - if the police and justice can - or to let some vigilante liquidate them - if the police or justice are too slow. This is typically American efficiency and practicality: the objective is to reach the target and the goal at the lowest price possible and in the shortest time possible and with as few collateral damage as possible. At times this practicality and efficiency create impossible situation like in Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan, but there is always a rub somewhere in the carpet of life.<br /><br />But the best part remains the opening credits that have not changed from the very first episode, especially the admirable mechanical mosquito, and the music of the whole series. Long live our Dexter International, registered and unlicensable trade mark and copyrighted character. After all he could be some night partner of ours on some winter nights when we are alone and cold in our beds and need some distraction, more than entertainment.

0061801313|5.0|Yeah, you read that right.  I started watching the show on ABC Family, and I decided, \\"Hey! Why not try out the books?\\" I know why I shouldn't have, addiction.  Yep, to a book.  I couldn't stop, I was half way done with the first book when I ordered the 5-8 AND I finished all 8 in about a month and a half.  Quick, I know.  You will too, they're super quick reads, captivating and a complete 180 from the show, which was awesome because it was like two separate drugs.  Yeah, at least they're positive influences on me! Or are they? Argh, read them let me know what you think.
0307887898|5.0|This book is jam-packed with information, philosophy, and - most helpful - case studies that elucidate the topic at hand. The concepts inside have grown out of the tech startup world but are clearly helpful for growing & sustaining any type of business.<br /><br />While Ries may be writing from a more left-brained perspective, the bigger concepts and general MO of The Lean Startup are perfect for creatives wanting a different look at what it means to start a business.
B000YZDLZM|5.0|While the American re-issue of this, one of Lennon's more consistent post-Beatle releases, sounds superb due to Peter Cobbin's remix, it is this version Lennon fans should opt for.    While both versions contain the aforementioned remix, this one far outdoes the other in it's exact miniaturized duplication of the Lp's original packaging.    The CD itself also has the gorgeous Apple label as found on the original album.  The Japanese are strictlers for details in their mini Lp's  (their Imagine version even has the Lennon-faced Apple as found on the original album);  American CD manufacturers can learn a lesson or two from these folks.      To drive the point further home, I can honestly say that fans should forego spending their hard earned dollars on the newer box set of the original mixes and hunt down all of John's albums in these superior Japanese-packaged configurations.
0345528581|4.0|I bought this book in paperback format so I could see the pictures and am glad I did. Some books do not translate well to electronic media unless you can control the picture size.  The book itself offers great alternatives for a whole body workout and gives beginner to advanced exercises. I workout 6 days a week and use this book everyday for 1/2 of the workout. I think it was worth the money. My only complaint is I wish it had even more exercises because I love variety.

B004HD61KE|4.0|This was actually the first book by Rollins I have read.  I hesitate to say that I actually selected it based on the cover alone.  After reading some of the reviews I was cautiously optimistic about how good the book would be.  I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised and have since started to read the Sigma series in their proper order.<br /><br />This book was well written and seemed to flow very well.  Rollins writes in a manner that keeps the reader intrigued and hungry to get more out of the book.<br /><br />I would recommend this and the rest of the Sigma series novels to anyone.  Rollins has now become an consistent presence on my kindle.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|After realizing I had three different tags in Shazam for three different songs by the same band, I knew I had to download the album.  I've never been into folk, bluegrass, or celtic music, and even though this band is a meld of all three, I love it.  I'm normally a rock/indie rock/alt rock/a little hip-hop listener, so I'm surprised at how much I love this music.  There is something about it that grabs you, makes you tap your feet, and lifts your heart and soul.  Some of those banjo riffs really do make me feel like something in my chest is tightening and being pulled up with the tension.  Those with a history of heart problems may want to check with their doctor before starting on a Mumford & Sons regimen.  In my opinion if you think you won't like this group as their type of music is not your typical cup of tea, you're probably wrong.
0307887898|5.0|So many start-ups, particularly in Silicon Valley, fall into the pitfalls Eric describes in this book.  In a start-up culture that tends to value and glamorize big money VC rounds and/or celebrity founders who willed their companies to success, the Lean Startup provides a steady, rational and proven methodology that, in the end, is much more likely to result in success.  It's the right way to start a company, and I've applied many of the concepts directly to my start-up business.  Eric's first-hand experience and well-articulated advice, encapsulated in his blog and this book, is a must-read for any would-be founder.

Far be it from us lowly fans to recognize some story points you've destroyed with revisions, were perfect the first time. The complete saga isn't really complete if it doesn't contain the originals also in high def. But you don't care. Your ego makes you deaf to what we would like as being irrelevant. Thanks but no thanks Mr. Lucas-you supreme narcissist.
B005COO1X6|5.0|It seems that Stephen King can come up with an amazing story, but he somehow loses focus in the last breaths of the plot, and the ending fizzles.  I've felt like this for much of his work--but the fact of the matter is, he still comes up with killer stories (much like his killer cars).  Mile 81 is no exception.  The build-up is great, and King has this great ability to do similar things over and over again, while each time doing something a little bit different.  This story reminded me of The Raft, from [[ASIN:0451168615 Skeleton Crew]] and while not as good as The Raft, it still does not disappoint--especially not for 2.99.

0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries defines a startup as \\"a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\\"  As a new college professor -- trying to serve student learning for the first time in a new environment -- I find that the principles of his innovative practices extend far beyond the boardroom or garage.  Build, measure, learn, and then pivot (or persevere): I build all the time: class plans, syllabi, assignments.  But I need to develop ways to measure the success of what I build, and consider pivoting, by creating radically different kinds of classes and assignments in hopes of advancing student learning.  Even in a university setting, in other words -- which is about as far as you can get from the fast-paced world of the startup!-- Ries's lean startup principles can apply and help hone services.  Moreover, the book is an engrossing and lively read, stocked with vivid examples.  Ries's intelligence and lucidity make for a fascinating guide to the world of 21st century business.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This must be one of the only non-fiction titles I've ever read and I like it more than 80% of the fiction titles I do read! Tina, you are a crack-up on TV and even more so in words. I love you and your humor, keep it up!<br /><br />Her stories come across just as funny and entertaining, yet real, as she comes across on our television screens. I actually feel like her and I have been friends for years after reading the book. Loved it!
B0059R5Q08|2.0|What a piece of crap! This version leaves out soo many of the important details! I.E. Mrs. Rochester ripping up the Veil! How about the details involving Mr. Rochester's mistress in Paris? There was also no witty banter between the two that characterize their relationship. It is all doom and gloom in this version. They could have done so much more with a Hollywood version, which they don't typically have the financing to do with a miniseries- I mean come on could they not have at least included Rochester's horrific injuries at the end? For people who have actually read the book, this is a weak attempt at an adaptation. Save your money and watch the Masterpiece Theater version starring Ruth Wilson, and Toby Stephens. I am going to have to watch that one twice just to get the awful taste of this movie out of my mouth. In that version there is a heated chemistry between the two that is palpable, and that movie sticks to the book, perhaps not as well as the 1983 Timothy Dalton version, but at least after watching that one I felt...well not pissed off for starters.
1451629184|4.0|This book is Awesome!! I'm not a reader.  I actually hate reading and this is the 1st \\"full\\" book I have read (I'm 39) From the moment I heard she was going to write a book about her 18 years of being held captive, I knew I wanted to read that book.  And so, I did.  I read 78 pages before setting it down and then finished the book the next day. It's an easy read that's hard to put down.  Jaycee didn't hold out anything.  The details she gives will make you cringe but, I thought it was her way of facing what happened and dealing with it.  I bet this book was therapeutic for her.  Great job Jaycee Lee Dugard

In the name of my father, and his father before him, I cast you out!\\"  Next in line for the throne Thor (Hemsworth) thinks he can do no wrong.  After he leads an unsucessful raid his father is not happy.  Thor is cast out from his world and lands in present day and meets Jane (Portman).  Together they must find a way to get him home.  This is a rare type of comic book movie...one with an actual story that keeps you interested.  The acting is also the best I have seen in a movie like this in a long, long time.  Next to \\"X-Men : First Class\\" this is the best comic book movie of the summer, as well as one of the most exciting movies of the year.  Even the little roles are memorable and add to the story.  Anthony Hopkins and Renee Russo playing the mother and father give this movie credibility to being more then another super-hero movie.  If you are a fan of comic book movies you will love this. If you are not, much like the new \\"X-Men\\" movie, you will still enjoy this.  Overall, a very entertaining and fun movie that will not disappoint.  I give it an A-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I would.<br /><br />*Also try - Incredible Hulk & X-Men : First Class
0307887898|5.0|An an entrepreneur and angel investor with several startups under my belt, I believe that Eric Ries' The Lean Startup is a MUST READ for anyone involved in startups these days.  If I had to recommend one book to fledgeling entrepreneurs in today's market, it would be this book - no question.    People working in large and established companies, however, might need this book even more.  The methodology described in \\"The Lean Startup\\" just might be the antidote to \\"The Innovator's Dilemma\\" that all established and successful companies must deal with.    Ries defines a startup as: \\"... a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\\"  Large companies are full of such \\"human institutions\\" and when it comes to creating new products they are dealing with the same conditions of uncertainty as startups.  If anything, large companies are much more likely to commit larger and more costly mistakes than startups and much slower to react to them.    If you are an entrepreneur you need to study and practice the advice in this book.  If you want to be an entrepreneur and start a company, but you believe that you need a ton of VC money to do so, \\"The Lean Startup\\" will set you straight and motivate you.    But don't let the title mislead you; people working in organizations that are as far removed from the typical image of a startup as can be (e.g. large companies, government organizations) need to read, absorb and practice the lessons in this book even more to remain competitive.
0307887898|5.0|Full disclosure: I know Eric and read early drafts of the book. Which makes it notable that I learned a lot reading the final, published book. But I shouldn't be surprised. Eric practices what he preaches, and he got he got a lot of feedback from entrepreneurs who read drafts and heard his talks. He incorporated that information into his model, his explanations and his stories, making for a rich book that has ideas and advice you can put to use immediately.<br /><br />By applying the ideas of lean manufacturing to other types of businesses, and by bringing to bear not only his experiences but also those of countless other thoughtful managers and entrepreneurs, Eric has created a lens on business unlike any other today. You'll not only learn from his book, but you'll learn how to learn--a core skill in any career. A worthy read.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|The title may seem over the top, but actually the implications of Eric's new book are huge. I can't remember a text in recent years that predicted such significant conclusions for society, education, and world business.    **Concepts in the book that will make your head spin:    1) Ries's Law (I'm coining this right now) - Moore's Law that states the cost of new technology will rapidly decrease thereby reducing technological risk of innovation. It's not until The Lean Startup that we realize the cost of reaching customers and thereby market risk will also rapidly decrease.    2) Entrepreneur mythology as we know it is wrong (aka Steve Jobs is not what he seems). Iconic innovators ala the founders of Apple are believed by the public to be successful because of their creative vision of the future. The Lean Startup shows that in order for founders to be successful, they must test each element of there vision against reality.    3) Demystifying startup metrics. Even in a startup mecca like NYC, few entrepreneurs understand the metrics that drive their business. Eric's Innovation Accounting paradigm will change the early-stage VC industry as we know it.      **What I like about the book:    1) Comprehensive and a pleasure to read.    2) Real world examples (case studies) from tech startups to the non-profit industry. You will not find anything like these in other books.    3) Case studies in chapters 6 & 7 alone are worth the price of the whole book.      **What I don't like:    1) The chapter titles are a bit confusing and non-descriptive.    2) I could see some savvy entrepreneurs getting bored with the beginning when there's really great content in the later chapters. But if you're new to Lean Startup, the beginning chapters are a perfect introduction for you.    3) Some of the sources are outdates. I recently checked the links at the back of the book and gotten a couple 404's, but after searching on Google was able to find the sources. (this might be fixed now, not sure)      **Final Words  As someone who is very active on the latest research into innovation and entrepreneurship as well as an long-time entrepreneur myself, I love Eric's book and think that it's going to become a true classic and stand out as THE business book to read in 2011-2012. Don't listen to the haters, just look at the reviews from people like Marc Adreesen (founder of Netscape) and Dustin Moskovitz (cofounder of Facebook), these people don't endorse you unless you you are the real deal. Eric & The Lean Startup are the real deal.
0061537969|5.0|Enzo is ready; ready to roam heaven's plains before he comes back to Earth as a man in his next life. He knows this is true because a NGO program told him so. Hours before the TV loving Terrier-mix dog's soul sets on this magical journey, he tells his story of his life with his \\"man,\\" using the lessons he has learned watching Race Car footage with Denny. Balance, anticipation, and patience are important to life as well as to the art of racing in the rain. Just as Enzo knows these truths, he knows that Denny Swift is a Champion; a champion with responsibilities.<br />It is also important to live in the moment, being one with the race car. And throughout his life, Enzo has learned to be one with his life, especially when Eve enters the Swift household.  He is a good listener. He is a good protector to Zoe when she arrives too. But the Zen Philosopher can't protect Eve from the tragedy that befalls his family. All he can do is to listen and offer comfort as only as Enzo can.<br />To say more would ruin the story for readers who have not read the novel. All I can say is have a box of Kleenex near to wipe tears from your eyes and suspend disbelief as Enzo and Denny's story unfolds
B0053Q9DQI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a great deal and bought it for my home collection. However, my brother who had not read the book watched it with me and asked so many questions it quickly became clear to me that people who have NOT read the book might easily become confused. First of all, this movie starts in the middle of the book and then quickly jumps back to Jane's childhood, which it virtually glosses over, then switches back, with many flashbacks thrown in here and there. Jane's childhood must've taken up about one-fourth of the novel (I am guessing from memory) but the movie gives it about ten minutes, if that, and so doesn't really set up the mood quite like the book did. The movie doesn't make it clear that the treatment of the children at the school caused a huge portion of the student population to die, that Jane survived it while watching her best and only friend die, that she has been mistreated and abused repeatedly by people who she was under the authority of who were supposed to be her protectors, and how all those events impacted the person she became and her hesitancy to trust. It is never explained that Jane's rescuers are her cousins, that they are in need of money and stand to inherit from a relative that died, nor that she is the reason the money is tied up, as she is the main beneficiary. In addition, the scene from the book where Jane is outside with her male cousin on a dark night and hears Rochester's voice on the wind, and immediately and intrinsically knows something is wrong- and vows to herself to go to him- is filmed entirely differently here and with less intensity. The scene I had hoped most for- where Rochester returns home unexpectedly, posing as a fortune-telling gypsy, and the wonderful monologue directed at Jane which reveals his feelings to the reader as he verbalizes them for himself and makes Jane feel she must be dreaming- was not part of this film, nor was it included in the deleted scenes! (Sigh.) Oh yes- and the ending was changed, which isn't bad, but the other one was so good! So why four stars? The acting was superb and the cinematography was wonderful! Michael Fassbender was perfect as the emotional Rochester and Mia Wasikowska was an excellent, intelligent Jane. And don't let me forget to mention Judi Dench who played the role of the housekeeper with such depth and insight she may have improved the character Brontë created. The acting really was very good and the chemistry of the two lead actors worked. Yes, the film wasn't perfectly true to the novel but the spirit was the same. I highly recommend this but encourage you to read the book, too! You'll be so glad you did!hich isn't bad, but the other one was so good! So why four stars?

B005COO1X6|2.0|I was hoping for better. After taking what felt like so long to set up an interesting scenario, the story fell flat for me. Avoided purchasing \\"Under the Dome,\\" since the idea was basically taken from the Simpson's movie, and that, after being thoroughly disappointed by  the cell phone book which was just a lukewarm rehashing of The Stand. Has King lost his scary, original mojo? Maybe so.
0767903862|5.0|This is my first Bill Bryson book and I loved it.  I love traveling with Bill! I giggled and snorted audibly in the doctor's waiting room during a particularly funny section.  It's funny but not insensitively so, well-written and thoughtful. I felt the section on the Aborigines was rather poignant. I learned a lot about Australia, not only about how many ways I could die from the many dangerous animals, plant life or the harsh environment but also about the open friendly Australians and a good bit of Australian history. I'd been reading the more serious and risky travels of writers such as Paul Theroux and Jeffrey Tayler, etc. so this was a light-hearted but intelligent travelogue that was a really nice change of pace. Highly recommend and can't wait to start more Bill Bryson books soon.
0451232577|4.0|I'm not going to write a long in depth review but just hit on the main point. It's a very enjoyable read.

All in all its a good book but he's still to top eye of the needle.
0525422943|5.0|I am a huge fan of Gayle Forman, so I was so excited when I found out about Where She Went and just knew I had to read it, since I loved If I Stay so, so much. Of course, there was that little voice in my head: What if this book doesn't live up to If I Stay? What if it ruins my love for the first book?<br />As you can see, I sometimes like to `what if' a lot, but, I told myself, whether I turn out to love Where She Went or not, I was reading it. Am I ever glad I did!<br />Where She Went picks up three years after the horrible car crash that claimed the lives of Mia Hall's family, and, as we come to know, was the end of the beautiful relationship that was of Mia and Adam.<br />This book is told by Adam, Mia's ex-boyfriend, whose band, Shooting Star, has made the big time: I'm talking Grammy winning, double platinum, that kind of big. He's living the life with his movie-star girlfriend and never-ending fame. He seems to have it all. Only, his life hasn't been the same since Mia left, and he has been simply trying to exist without her ever since.<br />In Where She Went, it is clear that Mia has made her dream come true, and is making a career as a concert cellist. She happens to be playing Carnegie Hall the very same night that Adam has an off day in New York. They find each other again after three long years, and they spend the night by Mia showing Adam her New York, and by the next morning, they will part ways again, for whoever knows how long.<br /><br />This book was amazing! It was heartbreaking, heartwarming; heart stopping... it had you on edge from the start of every chapter, to the very end of every chapter.<br />Gayle Forman has a way of writing that leaves you breathless, wanting more, but not quite knowing if you can handle it.<br />Her writing is almost poetic; the way she takes you into her world, lets you feel the characters pain, feel their happiness, see the world from their eyes... it's beautiful.<br />I always knew while reading If I Stay that Adam seemed like such an amazing character, and I wished so much that I could know what he was thinking, how he felt about everything that happened to Mia and her family, about what happened to him and Mia after the end of If I Stay. I got my wish.<br />Adam was so true a character that at times, I often felt drained while reading this book from his point of view. He didn't sugarcoat anything, and let you know from the very first page who he was, how he was feeling, and what a ride you were in for, reading about the last three years of his life. Of course, Mia makes her way into this story and into the life of Adam Wilde once more.<br />If there was one thing I loved about If I Stay, it was the relationships; mainly, the relationship of Mia and Adam. Their relationship was beautiful, the kind of relationship you can only dream of. Adam was the perfect boyfriend, friend, and guy. I want me my very own Adam!<br /><br />And the song lyrics at the beginning of every other chapter were beautiful! It had me wishing that there really was a Shooting Star album that I could listen to, because I know I would just love it!<br />Bottom line: the emotion in this novel is overflowing, spilling over the pages and pulls at your heart. It will make you smile, mad, teary-eye, and full of the never ending love these two characters share. If you're a fan of a great love story that has amazingly relatable characters, great writing, and is overall amazing, you must get your hands on this book right now.  Gayle Forman has outdone herself once again, and I cannot wait for her next story!<br />\\"You don't share me.

B002QBS9KE|5.0|Like many when i broke the oem ear piece i thought i needed a new bluetooth set.  I found this replacement kit and the little ear pieces are wonderfully designed to be swaped out for larger/smaller units, for a fresh one as they get crudy and if you damage one you can trash it and put a new one on.  The better part is a 3 bag means it will be several years before i need to buy another ear piece.    The pack comes as you would imagine, just like in the photo.  If you are worried about the replacement process I found that they are all pre glued to a little frame.  You just take your old one push gently and un mount it by turning is 1/4 turn counter clock wise.  When you see the new ones it all makes sense, and the new ones install just the same but backwards.  I didn't know these parts were made to come apart, but with no instruction i figured it out is less time than it took to open the little bag.    I also found that you can also replace the battery if it is going bad, but you will have to search for the part to do that yourself.
B005J7K964|5.0|I used to possess the laserdisc release of Moroder's Metropolis, and have kicked myself for many years for ever parting with it.  I replaced it with a Japanese import laserdisc which documented the pathetic state of preservation the film was in before Moroder did his restoration.  Moroder found and incorporated fragments of footage, including scenes from the opening pleasure garden and the still of the original Maria's tomb monument, adding tantalizing perspective and characterization to what had survived as a bombastic allegory.  I was thrilled to hear of the eventual discovery of nearly all the missing footage in Argentina, and even more thrilled when the fully restored film appeared on blu-ray last year.  If you don't have that one, buy it in preference to the Moroder.  But if you have the full restoration, then why not get the Moroder, too?  It documents an important phase in the eventual reincarnation of this film.<br />What about the score?  It is a futuristic 1920's film, and the 1980's music seems to work with it somehow.  During the \\"silent\\" era live music accompanied projection of the film, so there was great flexibility in sound.  In large theaters, an organ or orchestra would accompany the projection, while in small theaters there would be a piano or small organ.  Now, nearly a century later, home video releases have all kinds of newly recorded soundtracks, from piano to organ to orchestra.  Some releases provide alternative soundtracks, so that one can choose from two or more options.  If one does not like any of the soundtracks, one can always turn the sound off and watch the film silently.  So, I welcome the release of Moroder's version, which is not the definitive Metropolis of all time, but was as close to definitive as one could get at the time.<br /><br />PS 21 March 2012.  Finally I have been able to compare the Moroder blu-ray with the Complete Metropolis blu-ray, both from Kino and both superlative.  The Moroder transfer is just as crisp on their shared material, and sometimes crisper.  The tinting occasionally obscures detail (faces of the children on their entrance scene) but mostly enhances the composition of the scene (stadium in brown with blue skies and white clouds above).  Moroder's use of conversational subtitles instead of intertitles helps the dramatic flow, and reduces the feeling of seeing a lecture instead of a film.  Moroder's musical score once in a while gets cloying, but respects the scene changes and moods more so than most silent scores.  One would never want to do without the extra footage presented on the Complete Metropolis, but Moroder's version is a serious piece of film rejuvenation, which proved that there was a public interested in the restoration of silent films.

0307887898|5.0|Over a year ago, good friend and serial entrepreneur, Dan Martell, turned me on to Eric's work and the Lean Startup methodology.  I devoured everything I could find online. Videos, slides, documents. There's a lot of random Lean Startup information out there but this book ties it all together.<br /><br />This is the new startup bible.<br /><br />(Steve Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany is also excellent and the two books go hand-in-hand. Eric studied with Steve and was influenced by his work.)<br /><br />The last time I felt there was a business book that was this \\"right\\" and this important, it was Seth Godin's Purple Cow.  Like Purple Cow, the concepts are clear and understandable.  The examples and case studies (good and bad) that Eric outlines proves that this methodology works.<br /><br />There are more entrepreneurs than ever, partly because it's possible to build something cheaper and faster than any time in history and it's getting cheaper and faster everyday.  That's why Eric's book is so timely.  It teaches entrepreneurs what to test to validate not that the product works but that they have a real business.  He walks you through what to learn and how to measure that learning.  He explains how to determine when to persevere and when to pivot.<br /><br />Not only entrepreneurs that will benefit from this book.  Executives in large companies, non-profits, really anyone with a new project or idea that they want to launch will save considerable time and effort by understanding the Build, Measure, Learn loop that Eric defines.<br /><br />There are countless business books filled with interesting but lofty, high level theories.  The Lean Startup is filled with actionable steps that you can (and should) implement immediately.<br /><br />I'm rigorously following The Lean Startup principles at Spindows.com, my video speed networking startup and it's already saved me thousands of dollars and months of what would be wasted development time.<br /><br />Buy this book.

0307887898|5.0|I have a bookshelf in the front area of my office.  In it are 4 different books, with 10 copies or so of each book in the shelves.  I have these books because I often meet with entrepreneurs and startups that need to learn exactly what one or more of the books contain.  The books, in no particular order, are:    ReWork  4 Steps to the Epiphany  Web Analytics 2.0  Business Model Generation    After reading The Lean Startup, I'm adding a 5th book to the shelves.  Why?  Because there are startups I meet with every week that need to follow the teachings in the book. Too many good nuggets to go piece by piece, but let me say this; I've started 9 companies.  Sold 8.  If I'd had this book before that, it would have helped me save time, money and effort - three things I'd always like to maximize!  The lean startup methodology and scientific approach are eloquently explained and mapped out for the reader. While this book isn't for everyone (Eric notes that), I will be giving it out frequently to those that I meet with.  If you are an entrepreneur, you want to read this book.  Come by my office if you want a copy :)
B005COO1X6|1.0|This is a really bad book ! I never expected such a bad book from Stephen King. Whatever is happening has absolutely no meaning and has no explanation. Characters are too shallow and damn.. the ending is absolutely ridiculous ! If you are over 10 years old then you will regret buying this book ! I would say save your $ instead of spending on this stupid book.

B004EPYZTE|4.0|I have waited a long time for this Conan movie and worried it would be another Red Sonja.  This movie exceeded my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  Sure it could be better, some of the dialog was horrible and they should have incorporated the mask better in the end (what was the point of the mask again...it takes an hour to resurrect someone and still doesn't make the wearer any stronger?  How will Conan think his way through this one...oh yah, hack up the guy wearing the mask), but overall it was a great Conan movie.  While the content strayed from R.E Howard's work, the feel was very much in keeping with his style...and so what if they want to tell a story of Conan's childhood.  Most people watching this movie have never read the books.  It gave Conan greater depth and made him more accessible to everyone.  Plus his birth was bad-ass; very worthy of Conan.  Early in the movie when he went running off into the woods would have been an interesting time to work in the Frost Giant's Daughter story, but killing four picts before puberty was fine also.  What is most important in a Conan story is that there is never an ending.  He is always moving on to the next adventure.  I like the parallels between the original Conan the Barbarian movie and this remake.  Some of it is overt, such as the making of the sword, the pict raid and the thief character.  Others are more subtle such as the wheel motif.  They tried to incorporate a good soundtrack into the movie, but it is hard to beat the original.  If you like Conan, this is worth seeing.  I hope they make more.

0061906220|5.0|Love this book!  The librarian read it at the group I attend with my twin toddlers and we all loved it! so I had to find it in Amazon. The song is very catchy and pictures cute.  You don't have to download the song to enjoy the book.  Just make up a tune for Pete's song.  Great for practicing colors and encouraging a good attitude in life!
B004GHBQPG|5.0|American V: A Hundred Highways was the first posthumous release from Johnny Cash.  Before he died, Cash recorded scores of songs to be released after his death.  The best tracks were selected for American V and VI.  The product on the album is top notched but the aura of sadness and death hangs over the music making for a very sad and emotional final product.  My favorite songs are \\"On the Evening Train\\", \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\",  \\"Rose of My Heart\\" and \\"I'm Free From the Chain Gang\\".  Cash's arrangements of the songs changes the tone of the tunes.  He turns them into funeral hymns making them very hard to listen to at times.<br /><br />If you really enjoy the American series then I highly recommend this album.  If you though American IV was a classic, wait until you give this disc a spin.  Highly recommended.
B0059DOJAA|3.0|Edguy's albums only seem to be getting worse after Hellfire Club. I'd place Age of the Joker toward the bottom of the list, just above their first 2 albums back in the 90's which seem very experimental until they found their niche on Theater of Salvation. It almost seems like they're not taking this band seriously anymore. The energy, enthusiasm, and power is lost in this release. I sure hope they make up for it on the next album, and release more powerful songs like Mysteria, Babylon, and Tears of a Mandrake. Tobias has one of the best voices around, with incredible range, strength, and distinction. Unfortunately, those talents are not used to their full potential on Age of the Joker. It's not a bad album, but it's one of their worst.<br /><br />Best songs: Behind the Gates to Midnight World, Rock of Cashel, Every Night Without You
B00008IHN1|2.0|Sometimes predictable can work if it's crafted right.  Predictable is all around us.  Nearly every teen movie follows the same formula and so to nit-pick as it may seem can be tedious and about as predictable as the movie itself.  But, at the end of the day, I really want more from my popcorn fluff, and `Drumline' drops the ball in a very important area.  If you are going to regurgitate the same plot that every other film in your genre attempts to immortalize, you need to back it up with some solid acting and chemistry, because lets face it; that is what will keep you coming back.  Sadly, Nick Cannon really doesn't possess either.  He has limited acting skills and his charisma comes off fake.  He tries way too hard to be so cool, and it shows.  I hate that he's likened to Will Smith because Smith exudes confidence and has bountiful amounts of charisma; it's just who he is.  Cannon has the disservice of playing a very unlikable character (I hate people who feel entitled), but he doesn't bring anything fresh to it.  Sure, Zoe Saldana is gorgeous and I love looking at her, but her presence cannot save this flop.  The final showdown is wonderfully choreographed, and so I'd watch that for sure, but outside of that the actual story is a clich&eacute; ridden mess that follows the `formula' to a T without any interpretation or originality.  On top of that fopaux, the script contains so many illogical plot points that it does itself a major disservice.  Instead of just appearing to be a lazy attempt at making some quick cash off of the apparent newfound stardom of a semi-attractive young man, `Drumline' comes off like a STUPID and lazy attempt at making some quick cash off of the apparent newfound stardom of a semi-attractive young man.  It just doesn't work.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Is this only to be released in standard DVD format first???? I only ask since I bought the Blu-Ray version of the Snakes and Arrows concert and even though viewing the concert is truly the experience to aim for, I have to confess that watching in Blu-Ray...well...it just elevates the experience that much more...    In my humble opinion, if you haven't witnessed a Rush concert in person, watching a Rush concert in hi-def is really the next best thing... I could be wrong, but you have to at least give it a chance AND THEN decide...
B00005JKDR|5.0|As far as Pixar is concerned, they are sort of modern day geniuses.  I mean, outside of the horrendous `Cars' (I refuse to see `Cars 2'), they have had one homerun after another.  `Monsters Inc.' was one of the first Pixar films to really grab my interest as an adult.  Considering that `Toy Story' was released when I was ten, it was an instant hit with me at the time.  `Monsters Inc.' on the other hand was released when I was sixteen.  It's a lot harder to convince a teenager that an animated film is worthy of their time since to a teenager the word `cartoon' can mean one thing; `it's for children'.<br /><br />I was not a child anymore.<br /><br />That said, it was a film that some of my `female' friends wanted to see and so we all went together.  We loved it.  But honestly, what isn't to love?<br /><br />`Monsters Inc.' is yet another imaginative offering from Pixar, the studio that continues to reinvent animation by giving us vivacious stories of superheroes, flying houses and rats that can cook.  Here we have the story of a monster community that scares children to keep their city running.  Scares capture energy that is used like electricity.  The film focuses on two particular monsters, Sully and Mike.  When they inadvertently bring a young girl (who they affectionately refer to as Boo) back to their world, everything gets tossed upside down.  In the process we get a special and tender glimpse at the world of monsters and we see them come to a more docile understanding of their own existence.<br /><br />By the end of the film you'll just want to squeeze Sully so tight!<br /><br />The voice work is remarkable (but what else would you expect from a company that immortalized Ellen DeGeneres as a fish).  John Goodman is perfectly cast as the warm and lovable Sully (that voice is so serene and calming) and Billy Crystal IS Mike Wazowski!  The animation is crisp and endearing, with bright colors and remarkably real landscapes.  It's a stunning addition to the Pixar filmography, and one that everyone would be proud to own.<br /><br />I guess cartoons aren't just for kids anymore!e proud to own.    I guess cartoons aren't just for kids anymore!
0385534639|5.0|Imagine a roller coaster, wherein you lay on your back, and float across the sky staring at the stars.  Imagine a peaceful pool that takes in your worries on a stone tossed in, and leaves you calm and peaceful when you walk away.  Imagine a bonfire that changes color or a carousel made of living, breathing animals. These are just a few of the spectacles in The Night Circus.  Erin Morgenstern has created a reading expirience like no other in this mesmerizing and all-engrossing novel.  Trust me: no matter what others are saying, this is a book that you will want to read over and over and over again...
B0000AC8LR|5.0|A very strong directorial debut, `Donnie Darko' is a very modern twist on those tapestry films so many wannabe auteurs seem to be spilling out these days.  What is so great about `Donnie Darko' is that it remains oddly focused throughout the compelling insanity thrust onto every frame.  The core of `Donnie Darko' isn't as clear as some may want it to be, but that is half the fun.  Melding genres together to create something wholly original; it is safe to say that this film is unlike anything you've ever seen before.  Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal as the emotionally reserved young man who talks to giant rabbits and becomes obsessed with time travel.  As the world continues to evolve around him, Donnie finds himself increasingly fixated on a world inside that world, one that moves him and propels him to conclusions that will warp your mind.  The cast is extensive (Swayze, McDonnell, Barrymore, Malone, the hot Gyllenhaal...) and they all play their part, making the most of limited screentime to create whole characters that are interwoven into Donnie's destiny.  UGH, and please don't compare this to `Urban Legends' and `Final Destination'.  Those films, while entertaining to a point, are trashy slasher films that serve no purpose but to scare the audience.  `Donnie Darko' is a smart and provocative thriller that haunts more than it outright scares.  This isn't a film you can watch once and wholly appreciate.  This is a film that you need to explore.<br /><br />If you dare.
0553582038|1.0|SPOILER ALERT: (but not much to spoil, really)  If I had to describe A Feast for Crows in one word it would be BORING. Like everyone else, I thought the first three books were magnificent, but this book took me longer to read than the first three combined, because it was so... boring.      I think everyone has discovered Martin's style by now.  The first part of his chapters are always slow, with lots of descriptions of clothing and banners and how somebody's chamber pot smells, then the last four pages of the chapter are exciting. You read the slow stuff because you know there will be a payoff at the end of the chapter. In Feast, there are very few payoffs, just more descriptions and more non-action.     When I was reading it, I found myself thinking about other things, and then would realize the chapter was done and I didn't remember anything I had read. Are we really supposed to care about the childhood memories of a character that we do not know, or the genealogy of some random family, or the confusing \\"fever dreams\\" (I love how Martin continuously uses that phrase, a not-so-subtle subliminal plug for one of his other books) of a character we don't really like? By the way, has anyone else noticed that there are a lot of people suffering from fevers in these books? I think every single main character has had a life threatening fever at some point in the series, with some characters having multiple fevers. Martin should have called this one \\"A Festival of Fevers\\".     Unlike most people, I like Cersei's and Brienne's stories, as I think they are interesting characters. So I should like this book, right? Wrong. I don't like it because even though half the book is about them, they don't do anything for the entire novel. Cersei just plots and hates while Brienne just wanders down the road to find... absolutely nothing. Then the cliffhanger with Brienne is she says some word?  That is the cliffhanger?      Sam's story could have been summed up in a few pages. You cango ahead and skip his chapters, because all that happens is he rides on a boat to Oldtown for the entire book. Are they attacked by the kraken that Martin mentioned was spotted in some earlier book? No! Does anything happen on this laboriously long and tedious journey? No! He hooks up with Gilly and the old man dies, but that's not enough to fill the many chapters devoted to him.  The old guy says that Danerys is the chosen one? Wow what a shocker. We could have learned that info in a much less painful way. If all the info in the Sam chapters was condensed to one chapter, it would still be uneventful and boring.     If Sam did little, Arya does even less. I'm not even sure what happened to her now that I am trying to remember.    Sansa--somehow, Martin has done even less with her than Sam and Arya. Sansa, literally, does absolutely nothing in this book. She sits in a castle. That is it.    The sea pirate people are so boring that I had to start skipping whole sections of pages to get to some dialog that might move the story along. Who are they and why should I care? They devoted a chapter to the girl who looked like she was going to take over the Seastone Chair, but oops, she doesn't. Why was it necessary to even have that chapter? Moreover, why was it necessary to have these people and their aimless, meandering story in the book at all? Does Martin think we don't have enough characters to keep up with already?    The chapters that really take the cake, however, are the utterly useless Dorne chapters. In what sort of vacuum does Martin write that he would think that anyone would care to read this? The chapters are already about characters no one has heard about in 3500 pages of reading, but then to top it off he makes these characters do... wait for it... nothing! There is a chapter about Arys the Kingsguard and when you read it, you're like, \\"I guess he's going to be a main character now and I should get to know his character.\\" But no! After all of ONE chapter being devoted to him, he gets his head cut off. Great. Glad I got to know him. Martin also introduces the plot to put Myrcella on the throne and I was like \\"Ok, this is where these chapters are going, that's why Martin is taking us here.\\" But no! The plot fails, and that's the end of the story. So what has happened? Absolutely N O T H I N G. The woman behind the plot is then a prisoner in a tower for twenty pages when nothing, and I mean nothing occurs to her. You really feel the tedium of her being locked in the tower as you are locked in reading dry page after dry page of her laying in her bed and then using her bedpan, going back to bed, and not having dialogue with anyone. For 20 pages. The \\"payoff\\" with this is that Dorne has secretly been plotting with the Targareans? Who gives a $#!%? I cannot muster any interest whatsoever for the Dorne story.    This disjointed, slow paced, unrelated-to-anything-else-in-the-series piece of trash is a disgrace to the series. Do yourself a favor and just read the Wikipedia summary. It will be a lot more exciting and you won't waste a lot of time reading about \\"fever dreams.\\" I don't blame Martin though; many writers are self indulgent. I blame his \\"editor\\" for letting him put his name on this lump of garbage.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Read the story 4 times in a row, I just enjoyed it so much. His possesiveness & physical prowess was very fun to read, but above all, I love how Travis was not a dumb macho man, that he was both book & street smart as I love myself a smart man.      This story was an excellent fastasy get-away for me. In real life, I don't think I'd like the characters. I'm not into violence, detest fist-fights or any fights not associated with legally sanctioned tournaments, especially when it occurs within the school campus so therefore in real life, Travis & his jealousies wouldn't have flown with me. My first hs bf was like that & I gave him the boot so fast. I wouldn't have given the go-signal to my boyfriend to beat up some irritating classmate, no matter how obnoxious they would be. I married a gentle computer geek whom I love dearly, but for my own imagination, an alpha hero to sweep me off my feet, protect me from harm & grovel at my feet is perfectly all right;D     Highly recommended, 4 1/2 stars! What happened to the 1/2 star? Well, the epilogue was not really an epilogue for me, it was just a continuation of the story. Would have been really awesome if the epilogue fast-forwarded years later, after graduation, so we could see that Abby & Travis made it through the trials of college and still consider each other \\"The One\\" when they're professionals and really living life as full-grown adults, juggling work, kids and marriage.    This is a definite keeper for me!

B000PMLFRA|1.0|If you're thinking about buying these discs, DON'T DO IT.    The film quality isn't that good, the color timing is all wrong, and some of the additional effects are just weird. Darth Vader says \\"NOOO!\\" in \\"Return of the Jedi\\", even MORE CGI aliens are plastered into Jabba's palace, Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon scream sounds like it's from a cartoon...it goes on and on.    Just don't get these. The original films are NOT included on this, and you won't be buying the original Star Wars movies.
B001NTWFXW|5.0|I first heard Jobim, and bossa nova, on a road trip in the summer of 1965, when I was 8 years old.  Girl from Ipanema was actually a hit on the radio.  I've loved this music ever since - it never gets old.  Since then I have collected all of the vinyl, CDs and recordings I can find of Jobim, Joao Gilberto and others.  This album, and \\"Wave\\" in particular, is my favorite of all.  Mealncholy, sensual, languid, cool - all the great adjectives you can think of apply.  Jobim himself playing piano.  If you are, or want to be, a romantic, you must get this recording - it will never fail you.

B005E7AOHI|4.0|It's been a long 12 years waiting for a full length album!!! I've been a fan since the early 90's and enjoy anything Les does. That being said this record has a Les solo project sound. Which isn't a bad thing. It is nice to hear that Larry tone again. That is what sets it apart from Les solo projects. Enter Jay Lane...Man, this guy has got some serious chops!!! Probably because he was actually the first drummer for Primus...and yes before Tim. To me this record has a Tales from the Punchbowl kick to it. With solo jamming. The Metal/Thrash element is gone. If you're expecting the early Primus sound you might be disappointed. But I would still tell you to buy it!!!!

B005K0S2SW|5.0|After being blown away by Backatown, his previous album, I was a little apprehensive about whether Trombone Shorty would deliver the same energy and character, or would this album feel like 'more of the same'. So, I took the album out for a spin, literally, with an hour long bicycle ride. I did the same with Backatown, and ended that ride with more energy than I started with. For this album, I can say that my experience was just as exhilarating. This was another dynamic album that I really enjoyed.  If you want to get a good feel for the best of this album, check out these tracks: \\"Do To Me\\", \\"Buckjump\\", and \\"Then There Was You\\".

0307887898|5.0|I am not an entrepreneur. But I have a job -- an academic -- in which I need to be entrepreneurial. I heard Eric speak and he had insights for me in my endeavors and I'm sure for a wide range of endeavors. His book has been hugely beneficial, changed not only how I think about my work but what I do. I can't recommend it enough and anxiously await Ries' next.
034552554X|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about The Secret Language of Flowers. I found it to be well written on the whole, although in dire need of some more editing (over-use of the verb 'startle' for example, if she used it one more time I was going to scream! come on, a thesaurus someone? how could no editor have noticed this?) While the story was compelling enough to where I wanted to read the whole novel and did so over just 3 days, I found that each turn of events was entirely predictable and unsurprising, and other aspects were wholly unbelievable (how many unique and superlative talents can one orphan have? Not only is Victoria a natural genius at understanding the language of flowers and composing floral arrangements, but also a grape-tasting prodigy and self-taught talented photographer? and of course, beautiful to boot... and able to eat copious amounts of food without this affecting her body?) For me, most of the characters were not entirely believable. I don't want to give too much of the plot away by going into specifics, but Elizabeth is another example of this. Also, one criticism of the writing style, it seems to me the author took a lesson on the use of foreshadowing as a mean of trying to create suspense, and she ends up overdoing it.   The best part of this book is the secret language of flowers. Learning about the different meanings and symbolism, how Victoria decided to use those meanings in her bouquets -- that was really the strength of this novel and made the book worthwhile for me. These sections reminded me of Like Water for Chocolate or The Mistress of Spices. However, I would have liked more details on how the bouquets affected the lives of her customers.   I was disappointed in the ending, though, I found it to be over-the-top. It reminded me of American movies that feel like no matter what happened over the course of the story, it has to end all happy, wrapped up in pretty paper with a big bow like a cheerful gift or fairy tale. Again, all a bit tooperfect and not very believable for me.   In sum, I would say that this is an enjoyable beach or holiday read. I''m sure it will make the round of some book clubs, but it wouldn''t make the cut for mine. For me, the true test of a great book is that I want to loan/recommend it to friends yet worry about whether they return it because I know that I will probably reread it at some point and want it on my bookshelf permanently. While I might lend The Secret Language of Flowers to a friend for some light entertainment, it wouldn''t bother me if they forgot to give it back, because I doubt I would ever feel the desire to read it again. On second thought, it might be handy for the dictionary of flowers included at the end though...
0062112430|5.0|I wasn't to sure if I would really like this book. There have been so many young adult books lately dealing with a society that controls it's youth/people that I didn't expect to be impressed. I was wrong.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver takes a different approach to controling societies. With love as a sickness, which everyone needs to be cured from, anyone could relate. I thought this book not only would be familiar with young adults but also adults. Everyone can relate to the love sick feeling. The feelings that make you do crazy things in the name of love. You can understand why they would want to cure the society from such an awful illness but at the same time you can see how it is affecting the people that have been cured.<br />Children grow up without the love of their parents which I think makes them only a bit more crazy for the love that they \\"need\\" to be cured of.<br /><br />This book is so much deeper than just the illness part. It really makes you examine what love does to you and the people around you. How it can be harmful and helpful.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Nothing new to say.    Special effects that look seriously DATED, like they were done by a cable channel, inserted into the classic films undo the years of hard work that went into the practical effects, models, etc.  Couple that with unnecessary additions to scenes, Vader screaming \\"Noooooooo!\\", and all the other changes, and you have a movie that is pure garbage.  Appalling.    All the people who are defending these inferior remakes have forgotten what it was like to watch the originals.    It's obvious that Lucas does not care about the fans or the legacy, as the original theatrical releases are not even in as bonus material.  If the originals were released as bonus content in this set, it would be a must-buy.  As it is, the studio is relying on uneducated consumers to grudgingly pick this up to prove that they are fans.  I'm just PRAYING that consumers bother to read the reviews before purchasing this set and vote with their wallets.    What would you rather see, a crappy Polaroid of Lisa del Giocondo, airbrushed and touched up, or the Mona Lisa?  There is a reason one is hanging in The Louvre.  Morons.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Heavy, thick, solid. The handle sucks compared to the micarta though it's serviceable. I stripped the coating and polished the blade. That was hard work.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|One word. Excellent! With Joey back, Anthrax has recaptured the sound that rocked my childhood. It is a hard hitting piece of metal with excellent drums, guitars and vocals. If you are looking for emo - you won't find it here. Its harder then their last studio album (We've Come For You All) which, while good, lacked the edge that this new album seems to have captured. Enjoy it!
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I wanted to see this because of the actors, but hesitated due to poor, online reviews.  Glad I ignored the critiques.  The acting was very good and the scenes exploring the deep relationships of all the characters made the plot plausible.  The Rachel character was a bit too stereotypical for me but still well done.
1591843162|1.0|This book is full of incoherent ramblings by Seth. There is no continuity in any of the headers and sub-headers of the book. There is no organization of content. He seems to have just dumped everything in his mind without bothering to organize any of his thoughts. Seth has a few useful thoughts but they are sprinkled all over the book. There is too much repetition in the book. The same ideas are repeated over and over again. He jumps from one thought to another with no connection between the two thoughts. Seth talks about 'art' but his 'art' is ugly and not worth your time or money. He talks about random people and random examples with no connection to the topic being discussed in that chapter.<br /><br />In summary, his writing is worse than my review above and I tried really hard to write poorly.
0380715430|4.0|I'm disappointed to read that THE MOTHER TONGUE has several factual errors (I will not bother to confirm or disprove other reviewers' opinions about them),which means I will not use it as a source for discussions or writing about linguistics.

B005974CDU|5.0|\\"A Dramatic Turn Of Events\\", Dream Theater's 19th & newest album, was released today, September 13, 2011. For 3 months I have waited for this album to be released ... a very long 3 months. But I will say this: This album was most definitely worth the wait.    \\"ON THE BACKS OF ANGELS\\"     I, first, heard this song back in June, as it is the first single to be released from this album. Let me tell you that when I first this song, I was immediately in awe. This is an incredible song.    \\"BUILD ME UP, BREAK ME DOWN\\"    WHOA!!! Incredible song.    \\"LOST NOT FORGOTTEN\\"    Another incredible song.    \\"THIS IS THE LIFE\\"    Fell in love with this song the minute I heard it for the first time.     \\"BRIDGES IN THE SKY\\"    Loved every second of this song, from start to finish. The song is very powerful in lyrics, music, and vocals.    \\"OUTCRY\\"    Way too awesome to describe. Another song I found to be extremely powerful.    \\"FAR FROM HEAVEN\\"    An incredible ballad, that actually brought tears to my eyes, for it pretty much describes my life.    \\"BREAKING ALL ILLUSIONS\\"    Awesome.    \\"BENEATH THE SURFACE\\"    Such an incredible song. It's a song that I could listen to over and over again.       As I said, I waited a very long 3 months for this album to be released and it was damn worth every second. And having this album contain 3 songs that, in many ways, describe my life, I have to admit is definitely awesome. It just makes me love this band even more than I already do.    NOTE: This album marks the first to be recorded with Dream Theater's brand-new drummer, Mike Mangini. Mike Mangini had replaced original drummer, Mike Portnoy. Now, Mike Portnoy was an incredible drummer, and I was completely heartbroken when I read about his departure. But I have to admit that Mike Mangini is, also, an incredible drummer. He came into this band, trying NOT to become Mike Portnoy. Mike Mangini came into this band to be himself, and use his own style of Prog drumming. All I have to say is: To Mike Mangini, welcome aboard.
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|If anyone was ever wondering what effect Disney's purchase of Pixar would have, look no further than this lowest-common-denominator offering from one of the most renowned and respected animation studios in American history.    Anytime Disney needs a quick 300 million dollars, they can now crank out another Toy Story or Monsters Inc to pad up the yearly revenues. And don't fool yourself, Disney will wring every inch of money and merchandising out of Pixar's name that it possibly can.    Story used to be king at Pixar, but this vanity picture shows that John Lasseter no longer has people around him to tell him when an idea is just plain bad. Or that nobody thinks John-Lasseter-as-Mater is clever or funny. Or that Joe Ramft was a better story teller than Lasseter will ever be.    Many people will apologize for this picture and claim that it's low quality is acceptable because \\"it's a kids movie.\\" I would respond with \\"kids deserve better than this, and so do you.\\" It's brain mustard like Cars 2 that's kept animation from growing up in America and kept it as - for the most part - cheap, patronizing, low-brow kiddie fare that offers about as much story sophistication and development as a Bazooka Joe comic.    I realize Pixar didn't have a choice here, and their dilution was inevitable once Disney got their filthy paws on the studio, but it's still sad to see them sacrifice 25 years of integrity and quality just to make a few Disney shareholders a little richer.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|His system is solid marketing for his specific circumstances, I'll grant. That doesn't mean it will work for you or even apply remotely to your situation. When one of the major cornerstones of his plan's success is to already have four-to-eight books available, that right there cuts out the majority of self-publishers. I can't daisy-chain my marketing and reviews and book links between my multiple products if I only have one book ready and it takes me longer than his two months to write another (hell, I'd be thrilled to write one in ten months). All his Twitter techniques are grand, IF you already have hundreds of followers, or know how to get them. All in all, the only reason I don't feel like I wasted three bucks is because it's not really his fault the techniques don't apply to me, or that I don't have the time or money to invest in websites and blog writing.
B005974CDU|4.0|A Dramatic Turn of Events is not so much a return to form as it is a return to coherent song writing without abandoning the dynamic twists and world class musicianship that mark every Dream Theater album. The album is decidedly positive, even triumphant sounding especially when compared to the dark tone of the bands last two albums, Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings. As with much of DT's work, ADTE borrows both thematic and musical elements from previous albums. But whereas SC and BSCL sounded stale and exhausted the bands latest work succeeds in creating something fresh and hopeful, perhaps a cross between the best elements of Octavarium and the the first disc of 6 degree's. In fact this is the bands most focused effort, by far, since Train of Thought albeit coming from a completely different musical and personal direction.     What I like most about ADTE is the amount of restraint shown by both Petrucci and Rudess. Both players are phenomenal musicians with chops for days. However, more recent albums have featured overindulgent back and forth soloing (even for a prog band) that extended songs by minutes and oftentimes added little emotional punch to the material. Such restraint allows ADTE to breath and provides Labrie and Myung space to turn in some of their best work in years. While difficult to say, this change may be partially attributable to the departure of Mike Portnoy who took a decidedly heavy-handed, perhaps controlling approach with the band in recent years. Inter-band dynamics are tough to decipher but it's hard to argue with the bands less claustrophobic sound and the inclusion of more melodically interesting material sans Portnoy.    While I am loath to do a song by song review This is The Life, Bridges in the Sky, and Breaking All Illusions are initial bests with On the Backs of Angels and Lost Not Forgotten being my least favorite tracks. The reality is that there are no weak or bad songs on this album. Labrie has returned with asolid performance after wallowing in mediocrity while trying to cope with the bands generic metal sound structures on SC and BCSL. It's also great to see Myung with heavy influence and lyric writing credits. He bass work is always more under the surface but his tone and contribution is notably more significant and a treat for fans. Rudess sounds more creative and less apt to reintroduce keyboard parts and solos with ill-fitting, mood altering effects. I suppose I have to say something about Mike Mangini. His playing is solid and allows the material to breath compared to his predecessor. I think the change was good for the band mentally and challenged them to write a better album.     Edit: *The more I listen to this album the better it gets. I bumped my 3 star rating to 4. I think it reaches the level of quality last seen on Train of Thought yet doesn't approach what I consider to be DT \\"5 star\\" albums: Awake, I&W, and SFAM.
0307887898|5.0|I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from The Lean Startup since I have been reading about and following the movement since 2010. What new techniques or insights was I going to read about? What had Eric learned in recent time that would be different from before? After reading the book I was very pleasantly surprised to find that above all it is a collection of success stories of companies that have put Lean Startup principles into practice. Of course, in hind sight I realized that Eric couldn't have done it any other way. If Eric was to practice what he's been preaching, then he had to put the Lean Startup principles themselves to the test, and provide ample evidence to the reader that this has shown real results (good or bad) for many companies.    The Lean Startup will help you apply the scientific method to your vision for a new business. All concepts are well presented and followed up with real examples from modern successful companies. Overall it has inspired me to think different about how I approach introducing innovation to established businesses, a necessity for survival in today's fast-paced and constantly changing economy powered by software and internet services.

B003UESJ9M|5.0|As a recovering alcoholic myself, I was skeptical of how Gwyneth Paltrow's character would be depicted.  That said, I don't think there could have been a more accurate portrayal of how alocholism/addiction works: the downward spiral; the insanity; the change in personality; the fact that even if life is going well and looking up (e.g., at the end of the film), this disease will sneak right up on you and bring you back down with it.  Many people believe that the main struggle in Paltrow and McGraw's marriage is his desire for her to only be a mega-star, but what I see is a man who fell deeply in love with his wife long ago and has deep wounds from her alcoholic misdeeds.  McGraw (and the writers) portrays this facet of anyone who has ever been in love with an alcoholic/addict so well-you can see the love he has for her in his eyes but he always pulls away, afraid to be confronted again with a wife he doesn't know (the alcoholic).  Her past misdeeds have changed him in mahy ways and I think the movie and the actors portray that EXCELLENTLY.<br /><br />I had already heard Gwyneth's \\"Country Strong\\" single and knew that if the rest of the music lived up that level, it would be an awesome soundtrack and it didn't disappoint. Leighton Meester and Garrett Hedlund have great voices and more of the songs from the movie should have been left to be performed by them.<br /><br />Meester and Hedlund also give strong performances-she is much deeper than at first glance, reminding us to never judge a book by its cover.  Hedlund is the kind of guy you always root for, who sticks to what he feels in his soul and doesn't back down from his beliefs.  He's a man true to his heart.<br /><br />This isn't just a movie about country music and superstardom as it seems from the cover.  I highly reccommend it!!
0030565812|5.0|This gives an insight into the South Africans struggle I respect Mandela more but I will like to read other books about him writing by someone with a balanced opinion. Then I can fully appreciate him. But his views and thinking are very clear and pure even reading what he wrote about himself you can see it clearly reading between the lines.  I know that he sacrificed a lot I am not sure that there are many people that could do what they did. But like he said in the book maybe extreem hardship will bring out such character but I believe that you have to have it in you for it to be brought out. I think that all those freedom fighters have it in them. We have seen people that less hardship brought out the worse in them they became criminals we see it everyday
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book based on the glowing reviews on Amazon and comments from several friends.  I didn't really pay attention to the significant number of low ratings.  I normally do.  But I really wanted to like this book!    Alas, my review also will be at the low end of the scale.  I should first note that I only read about half of the book.  I stopped when Jack escaped because that climactic scene was so poorly done.  But my interest waned much earlier.    I have raised two sons.  I have spent a lot of time around kids.  Jack does not have the voice of a five year old.  I'm not suggesting that I know how a boy held hostage would in \\"real life\\" speak, but Jack has thoughts and speech that are not consistent with his age.  Kids don't think like grownups.  Yet time and time again we hear Jack present thoughts and ideas that are at least 10 years beyond his development level.    Ma's voice is no more clear.  She has a slightly interesting character but her personality is not sufficiently filled out or consistent.  She just wasn't believable.    Aside from the sub-standard character development, the main reason I stopped reading is that the book is so poorly written.  It uses contrivances and \\"gee whiz\\" type statements that \\"real people\\" never use.  It's almost as if the author just was not sure how to move the plot along in a natural way.    So, best of luck if you choose to read this book.  I hope you have a better experience than I did.
B004P1YX6M|4.0|DG has struck gold in the past with young winners of the International Chopin Competition (Pollini, Argerich), not to mention a notorious non-winner, Ivo Pogorelich, before he lapsed into terminal eccentricity. Since it is held only every five years, the competition raises unusually high expectations, and the 2010 event drew exceptional playing (as heard on YouTube) form the young Russian woman who won, Yuliana Avdeeva. For some reason DG passed her up and chose to sign instead one of the two pianists who shred second prize, a 26-year-old Austrian. Not many German pianists have excelled in Chopin, to be sure, and there's a drought among outstanding German pianists to follow in the footsteps of Alfred Brendel. Did those considerations weigh heavily on the decision?<br /><br />DG also signed the 2005 winner, Rafal Blechacz, who made a sensational debut bu returned to continue his studies in philosophy - of all things - his specialty being aesthetics and the philosophy of music. Wunder won't turn out to be a flash in the pan, I venture. His recital begins with an extremely assured and poised reading of Sonata no. 3 in B minor. I think that buyers of Chopin CDs tend to fall into two groups, those who are content to buy Arthur Rubinstein's recordings, looking no further, and those at the opposite extreme, who have heard dozens of versions of every work. For the latter, there's a danger that familiarity will breed numbness. Yet another accomplished reading doesn't stir the blood, and on the other hand one's ears are pricked by the slightest hint of dullness or conformity. I've known connoisseurs to exchange a simple phrase - \\"the real thing\\" - to indicate that a new pianist has jumped over any number of invisible hurdles.<br /><br />In this case, I do think that Wunder (what a name, the equivalent of being named Miracle in English or being Stevie Wonder) is the real thing. There are no mannerisms,  stiffness, or competition whiz-kid tricks. He's sensitive and solid throughout the sonata. Touchstones like the lovely modulation in the middle of the Largo are handled effortlessly. None of this can be taught, and that's very good news. Is this a truly distinctive performance? Hard to say, because \\"sensitive and solid\\" aren't the same as deeply insightful or charismatic. My guess is that the charisma quotient will remain low with Wunder but that his musicality will keep maturing. He takes the finale with a measured tread, walking the line between solid and stolid, yet n the end my attention was held. The piano, by the way, sounds very good, and the pianist's technique seems to be assured without being dazzling. Happily, he never pounds and never tinkles, putting me in mind of Nelson Freire, who is the kind of artist Wunder might turn into one day.<br /><br />A more difficult test comes in the Polonaise-Fantasie  Op. 61, a longish work at 14 min. in Wunder's hands that requires the soloist to capture the elusive mood of the polonaise, a form invented by Chopin, as well as the ability to organize a work that is rhapsodic and spontaneous feeling. Horowitz made a specialty of mesmerizing audiences with this piece, but Wunder takes a very different road, eschewing high dramatic contrast in favor of inwardness and a flow of beautiful tone. There's a peculiarly graceful limp in the way that Chopin's polonaises and mazurkas move, and knowing this, many pianists exaggerate the lopsided phrasing in order to show that they catch on. Horowitz was a master of exaggeration (Virgil Thomson applied the phrase in the Forties as a detraction, but it needn't be) while Wunder aims to master understatement. He delivers a subdued but not boring reading, de-emphasizing the rhapsodic element.  He might have been better off keeping closer to the usual timing of 11 min., but even if the performance felt a little drawn out, it was highly acocmplished.<br /><br />Ballade no. 4 in F minor is a required work in the Chopin Competition, I believe, and Avdeeva, the winner, delivered a reading that started out a bit ordinarily but reached extraordinary depth and passion by the end - maybe it won her the gold medal. Wunder remains in the vein of his earlier readings, giving us mature musicality that isn't quite distinctive. The rising Argentine pianist Ingrid Fliter, also a second-prize winner, has a more individual voice, but then, she won in 2000 and has experience over Wunder. In this Ballade his chief failing is that he doesn't find a way to make the repetitions of the main theme build into a devastating conclusion; they tend to sound like repetitions only.<br /><br />finally, another required work, I believe, the Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise Op. 22, and here for the first time i'm tempted to say \\"good Chopin, for a German.\\" This music is meant to be free and even abandoned in its onrush of melody, while Wunder is lyrical, correct, and controlled. One immediately wants to add that the musicality is always present and impressive. We live in an era of rising accomplishment in leading conservatories, and Wunder exemplifies the astonishing way that young musicians are able to absorb (mimic?) styles that evoke real sophistication. What they don't evoke is a strong personality or point of view. Going back to Yundi Li, who won the gold medal in 2000, I can't say that he is better in this music than Wunder, yet neither quite captures the magnetism, even if very soft passages, of Michelangeli, Pletnev, or Argerich when I turned to them for comparison.<br /><br />You can be the real thing, then, but the great thing still lies ahead of you.er, delivered a reading that started out a bit ordinarily but reached extraordinary depth and passion by the end - maybe it won her the gold medal.

B005ICN0DY|4.0|When pop musicians know what they're doing, they make you happy, and that's the effect the Kooks have on this album. Its hooks, harmonies, and lyrics are all designed to delight. On the title track, Luke Pritchard sings \\"I wanna make you happy, I wanna make you feel alive,\\" and he means it.<br /><br />\\"Junk of the Heart\\" is the Brighton-based band's third studio album since 2006. Its themes of happiness and love are wrapped in an irresistibly warm sound, but the music isn't precious by any means. These are polished songs from a band that has perfected its writing and playing. While surrounding the lead vocals with the traditional rock triad of guitar, bass, and drums, Pritchard and company add a big palette of sonic effects, percussion, and synthesizers.<br /><br />Love songs like \\"Rosie,\\" \\"Taking Pictures of You,\\" \\"Petulia,\\" and \\"Eskimo Kiss\\" predominate on this collection. Some have great rhythmic drive, some are more vulnerable or confessional, and some, like \\"Time Above the Earth\\" have a fragile, ethereal quality that's hard to describe or classify. But not all are so romantic: \\"F*** the World Off,\\" \\"Killing Me,\\" and \\"Mr. Nice Guy\\" have a harder edge.<br /><br />The first single, \\"Is It Me,\\" is actually more formulaic than most of the other songs on the album, bearing a resemblance to Arctic Monkeys and other British groups. Had it been my choice, I would have led with \\"How'd You Like That\\" or \\"Runaway,\\" both of which are catchy as all get out.<br /><br />The first two Kooks albums, \\"Inside In / Inside Out\\" and \\"Konk,\\" were well received by the press and the public, and \\"Junk of the Heart\\" is certain to continue the trend.
0385534639|5.0|The book arrived without warning. No announcements preceded it. It was simply there when yesterday it was not - although it was brought by a Big Brown Truck rather than a black and white train. But this reader was so very happy that it arrived.<br /><br />The Night Circus is a special book. A book of magic and love and time and place. It's a story unlike anything I have ever read before and when I finished it I wanted to start it all over again knowing that I would find aspects that I missed on my first read.<br /><br />It's a book ostensibly about a circus but it's also a tale of love. It's also a tale of power and abuse of power. Ms. Morgenstern has created a world unlike any other and put it smack dab in the middle of 19th century Europe and America through a traveling circus. But a very special circus open only at night and where everything is black and white.<br /><br />The imagination involved to create the circus and the writing ability that allowed me to experience it in my head is just extraordinary. I felt like I was walking through the circus and exploring the tents. I was there; the calliope music was playing but it was not a tinny sound it was the sound of an orchestra.<br /><br />The writing is lyrical, the characters magical (no pun intended) and the plot enthralling. I wish I had the words to fully express my joy at this book. My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. It was a world I didn't want to leave. I have found my new favorite book of the year. I am keeping and I will read it again and again.

B001UV4XUG|3.0|I had to watch this movie three times to formulate an opinion on it. This is a classic story of boy meets girl. Girl meets guy. Cry cry, cry. The end. Nothing from the film really stood out to me except for the penis game and Thomas's friend McKenzie, who sang out at the bar \\"... and I'm proud to be an American!\\" I always burst out singing that song at random...while sober. I feel like Joseph Gordon-Levitt  is starting to get type casted because he was in a similar film called, 10 Things I Hate About You, which was a great film by the way, much better than this one. Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) is really just another girl. Time and time again there will always be those pathetic guys who fall for these witty, quiet girls with no real personality. So honestly I am glad this movie is out there for those indie wannabe type boys who only go after those wannabe indie girls with light skin and dark hair. Wake up bitches and snap into reality. The character of Summer didn't really show any passion or interest in Thomas what so ever. She just kept calling him a friend. She was pretty cold and quiet, really reserved. I'm not even sure why Thomas was attracted to besides her body because she didn't have much of a personality at all. All this makes sense at the end of the movie. Anyway, I hope anyone who watches this learned a lesson. Everything you think you know about love is crap. Forget about it. This will show you how easy it is to get carried away with the idea of romance and love. If you know of a guy who likes this movie a lot, it's because he was screwed over by a girl like Summer, but what happened to Thomas in this film can happen to anyone.

B005CAAURG|5.0|Queen's sixth album News of the World was released in November of 1977 in the States.<br />The album was recorded in the height of the punk rock movement in the UK at Wessex Studios with the band self-producing once again with Mike Stone engineering (last time Mike would work with the band as he went on to produce albums for Journey, Asia and Styx member Tommy Shaw among others).<br />Aside from the graphic album cover depicting a giant robot-like creature who killed the four Queen band members (thank drummer Roger Taylor for that concept) but also meaning it was a baby robot who injured the human like a baby injuring a bug and saying \\"what have I done\\"), there are nothing but great songs throughout.<br />The album opens with the one-two punch of the US #4 charting \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\". The former was written by guitarist Brian May and is known for its stomp-stomp-clap beat and rally cry. The latter was frontman Freddie Mercury's victory cry which has become a victory song when sports teams would win championships. Next, is drummer Roger Taylor's answer to the punk movement \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (which was written for the album with the same title three years earlier but not finished until 1977). The song was as punk as Queen ever got (ironically The Sex Pistols were in the studio next door recording their only album when this track was recorded) and Roger plays drums, bass and rhythm guitar on this track. Brian's \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" is a soft beautiful ballad sung by Brian with Freddie on backing vocals. Bass player John Deacon's \\"Spread Your Wings\\" follows and is a mid-tempo rocker about one not giving up on his dreams. That track was released as a single in Europe and was the first single released where there were no backing vocals from the other Queen members. The first side closed with \\"Fight From The Inside\\" is another heavy rocker sung and written by Roger (whom also played guitar and bass on the track and did all the vocals on this track).<br />Side two began with the lyrically dirty \\"Get Down Make Love\\" and is one of the few blatant sexual anthems that Freddie wrote with raunchy guitar playing by Brian (lets see Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera and/or Beyonce sing (let alone attempt to write) something like that). Brian steps out in front on \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk\\" which is a bluesy shuffle track with some great guitar work and was recorded without overdubs (save Brian's harmony vocals). John's \\"Who Needs You\\" is another great track with Freddie's elegant vocals and featuring Brian and John on acoustic guitars. Brian's \\"It's Late\\" is almost in the same vein as some of the epics they wrote in the past, but alot heavier and not strange. The ending is great as Roger goes into this insane Bonham/Peart like drumming, if not better. It was released as a heavily edited single in the US and flopped but the song rocks. The lyrically depressing but superb \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" is an all-out jazz song featuring Freddie's sorrowful vocals which is a great song for those whom have had either broken hearts or bad days and ends the album in a relaxing fashion (and like \\"Spread Your Wings\\" has no backing vocals on it).<br />News Of the World peaked at #3 in the US and sold over 4 million in the US alone to date because of the songs and not the personalities in the band and News of the World became Queen's best American selling album until The Game in 1980 tied this.<br />In September of 2011, Queen re-releases this classic masterpiece as well as the next four studio albums (Jazz, The Game, Flash Gordon Soundtrack and Hot Space) as all newly remastered as 2-CD Deluxe Editions painstakingly remastered by Bob Ludwig (who did a remaster of A Night at the Opera for its 30th Anniversary in 2005) for most of the world (the outside US release was in July) and these new remasters buries any previous CD version of the back catalog.<br />The bonus CD for News Of The World contains a nice outtake of the fabled \\"Feelings Feelings\\" which was recorded for News but scrapped.

B005CAAU76|5.0|Queen's seventh album entitled Jazz was released in November of 1978.<br />The album has always had the distinction to many of Queen's fans of being Queen's worst 1970s album but I think it is great (as I found out when I first got the CD in April of 1992).<br />The album saw the band co-producing with Roy Thomas Baker for the first time since 1975's A Night at the Opera (they would not ever work together again on original material) and was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland and Superbear Studios in France with the band avoiding the British tax man.<br />We begin with lead singer Freddie Mercury's \\"Mustapha\\" which is a Middle Eastern sounding track and a unique opener. Freddie singing in Arabic is a grand way to kick off a diverse Queen record. Next was the album's US Top 30 hit \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" and penned by guitarist Brian May and is a great rocker dedicated to Brian, Roger and John's wives (or in Roger's case girlfriend) and was a concert staple on the 1978/1980/1982 US tours. Freddie's ballad \\"Jealousy\\" follows and is a beautiful song which did come out as a single in the States but flopped. On this remaster, the bass drum which was muted was restored and brought up in the mix. Next is the album's biggest US Top 30 hit \\"Bicycle Race\\" (which was the A-side to Fat Bottomed Girls) and this Freddie penned number was written whilst watching the Tour de France from his hotel suite. This song showed Queen did not ever take themselves too seriously. Next is bass player John Deacon's rocker \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\" which was John's first true rock number he wrote for the band. The first half ends with Freddie's homage to the excessive rock lifestyle called \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" which is a great rocker and was a staple live on the band's 1978/79 and 1980/81 tours.<br />We begin the second half with a May rocker called \\"Dead on Time\\" which is one of his best rockers. Next is a Deacon ballad \\"In Only Seven Days\\" about meeting someone and falling in love while on vacation (also one of few Queen tracks not to have backing vocal harmonies). The track would not have sounded out of place on either Billy Joel's The Stranger or 52nd Street albums as it has the feel of a Billy Joel tune musically. Next is Brian's jazzy \\"Dreamers Ball\\" which is a song which may sound lazy on studio version but when played live on the Jazz tour was better. Next is drummer Roger Taylor's \\"Fun It\\" with Freddie and Roger trading lead vocals. The rock-disco track sounds like a pre-cursor to Another One Bites the Dust on the next album. Next is Brian's \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" and has Brian May on all vocals and is a nice, acoustic number. The big UK hit and song that stalled at #86 in the US \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" is next and one of Freddie's classic pop rock songs and a great song. We end the album with Roger's rocker \\"More of That Jazz\\" which had Roger on EVERYTHING (including all vocals, drums, guitars and bass) and is a great song. Before the song ends, the abrupt appearance of collage 'soundbites' of most of the tracks over the course of the album, probably spliced in to give the false sense of sounding like a commercial for Queen's Jazz album which Elektra Records probably did for radio promotion in 1978.<br />Jazz when released hit #6 in the US and went Platinum immediately but sales were soft compared to the four previous albums but still a great record nevertheless.<br />In September of 2011, Queen re-released this classic masterpiece as well as the other four studio albums from 1977 to 1982 (News Of The World, The Game, Flash Gordon Soundtrack and Hot Space) as all newly remastered 2-CD Deluxe Editions painstakingly remastered by Bob Ludwig (who did a remaster of A Night at the Opera for its 30th Anniversary in 2005) for most of the world (the worldwide release outside the US and Canada happened in June) and these new remasters buries any previous CD version of the back catalog.<br />The bonus CD for Jazz contains the single mix of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" which is commonly on all greatest hits collections.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Pre-ordered in April. And until now, at the end, do I understand! I can not accept \\"NNOOOOOO\\" added for Vader in ROTJ in which it changed the whole feeling of that scene. And that did it for me!! Again, that scene is now dumb down for the new generation and the yippies out there-so sad,so sad!!!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|Hmmmmm - to read or not to read. It seems almost as many hated this book as there are those who loved it. The fact that it only costs three bucks (on Kindle) sort of makes me wonder. Does the publisher perhaps agree with the nay Sayers? I guess for three dollars I can afford to find out if it sucks or not.<br /><br />As the big T said, \\"I'll be back\\".
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I love the XMen series and the First Class was well done; however there are movies that I classifiy as worth waiting for to own but not go to the theater to see.  That may not make sense to anyone but I would rather pay the $25 to own the BR than pay more than $25 (ticket and snacks) to watch it in our less than nice theater.  The acting was excellent and plot was good. Personally I think that it would have been better for me if this one had come out first because I never read the comics.  I was born 100 years too soon because I love science fiction.  Reccommend this movie especially for those who have seen the previous ones in the series and not this one.  Oh yeah Amaxon Prime is great especially if you order a lot of things from them.  Free two day shipping and $3.99 for overnight.  If the stuff your order has any weight to it you make the fee back the first time you order.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|As the reader I am, this book was a wonderful beach read and a late night story chapter. A very chilling read.  Although I rated this book with five stars, and it is my favorite book ever by far, Alice Sebold could really include more [incoming spoiler alert, folks,] thoughts and conversations that Susie had in the In Between. Even if Susie was the narrator of the story.   but all in all, I suggest this book for you!
B0058OUJA4|1.0|I'm a little bit annoyed that people can simply steal the work of others and feel no shame whatsoever.  My good friend David Whatley wrote 'GeoDefense Swarm' for the Iphone.  He did all of the game design, programming, and artwork himself.  He didn't rip-off anyone else's product, what he did was completely original and unique.  Now, I'm not saying you can't make another game in the tower defense genre, that's fine, but don't copy someone's artwork and game design in exact detail and call it your own.<br /><br />How ironic that people are claiming that ZDefense is a rip-off of HexDefense which was, in fact, a rip-off of GeoDefense Swarm, an *original* game by another developer.<br /><br />You guys have no shame.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|Best studio album since the last one that Belladonna sang on!  Falls right in line with Among the Living and Persistence of Time.
B004SRWW0C|5.0|Tge problem with all the other applications that try to handle the file systems is they suffer in Root space. for whatever reason they feel wonky and unpredictable. Root Explorer however, has always been a solid file system solution allowing you to do everything from copying to pasting, moving files unziping many different compression styles including linux based zips. you can seamlessly mount and unmount read/write.

B003M98792|4.0|I'll never forget when I first watched Shogun Assassin. When I worked at a movie store, there was a regular customer who was always asking me about samurai and martial arts films. One day he came in with his own copy of Shogun Assassin, saying that I had to watch it since it was one of his all-time favorites. I watched it that same day and have never looked at samurai movies the same ever since. While Shogun Assassin is usually considered 'just' a B-film with over the top gore, I was mesmerized by the swordsmanship of Tomisaburo Wakayama. He made everything look so effortless, and if I didn't know any better, I'd have guessed that he was actually killing people! Eventually I learned that Shogun Assassin was actually the first two films in the Lone Wolf and Cub movie series but edited to move things along faster, and with a more modern soundtrack. Of course, I ended up watching all 6 Lone Wolf and Cub movies, though only the first three won me over. A lot of hardcore fans hate Shogun Assassin for 'ruining' Lone Wolf and Cub, but I don't think they understand that if it weren't for Shogun Assassin, a lot of people wouldn't have even known about Lone Wolf and Cub in the first place, outside of Japan at least.    Ogami Itto is the Shogun's executioner, and a master swordsman. He quits after being tired of the corrupt Shogun, and as a result, the Shogun sends a group of ninjas and kills Itto's wife. His infant son, Daigoro, is then given the choice of joining his mother, or going along with Ogami on the path of vengeance. Ogami sits in front of Daigoro with a ball and his sword, and whichever Daigoro goes for will determine his fate. Well, you know how cool shiny objects are to kids...Daigoro goes for the sword, and everything is set in stone. Ogami is ordered to commit seppuku before the Shogun's men, but defies them and takes them all out with the greatest of ease. He manages to construct a baby stroller for Daigoro as well, full of all kinds of weapons that will helpthem both out against their enemies. This is all just the beginning of a long blood bath.    To be honest, the movie is pretty much just a collection of Ogami Itto slicing and dicing bad guys [and girls], with very little emphasis on the plot. Since it's a cut up version of two movies, cramming the plot from both of those would've been hard to do, so they went with most of the action scenes, with an added narration by Daigoro which I actually like. The kills are over the top, with heads being split in half, limbs flying all over the place, and a neck-cutting scene that makes most people cringe. As I said earlier, Wakayama is incredible to watch, especially given that he's a little on the heavy side, but doing front flips like it's nobody's business and swinging his dotanuki sword as fast as say, anyone who's every played Zatoichi. The baby cart is a star in itself, with knives, spears and more being concealed within the handle and sides, though there's an even cooler weapon that isn't featured here, and you'll have to watch the Lone Wolf movies to see it in action. There's something here for everyone, and Shogun Assassin is essentially a sampler of the Lone Wolf movies. If you like what you see here, but want plot too, go watch the Lone Wolf movies or read the comic series. If there's anything I have to dock points for it's that they could've edited a few scenes better. That strangely long scene of Itto cutting into a guy's head as the hat and head split apart very, very, very, very slowly could've been trimmed. 'same with the scene where he's ambushed by ninjas in the woods. That scene always bugged me for some reason.    The picture and audio quality of the blu-ray are probably as good as we're going to get, unless they somehow have the team that restored The Wizard of Oz work on it. The picture is sharp and crisp, but there's still a lot of grain, lines and other things. It definitely looks better than any of the dvd releases that've come out. You can even see this for yourself in the special features where they compare this to a bootleg and the official dvd. As far as the audio goes, it gets the same great treatment, though it's a Linear PCM 2.0 mix. There is no Japanese audio option, just the English dub. Some people have complained about this but I don't understand why as this is Shogun Assassin...not the original movies it's cut from.    The special features are solid, with stuff for hardcore and casual fans alike. You get two commentary tracks: one with Ric Meyers and Steve Wilson and one with Davis Weisman, Jim Evans and Gibran Evans. The first track with Ric and Steve covers the sword fights, martial arts and Japanese tradition, and is very informative for those wondering about some techniques used in the movie. I'd like to say that Ric redeems himself here, after the embarrassment in the Kung Fu Hustle dvd interview he did a few years back. The other track is more about editing the movie to make it accessible for everyone, and how it came to be. It was cool to hear from Gibran, who voiced Daigoro when he was just seven. Next is an interview with Samuel L. Jackson, and while it's a laid back interview, I don't get why they chose to interview him for this, as all he does is talk about how much he loves Shogun Assassin, and the theater he used to go to as a kid that would always play cheap martial arts movies. I'll give him some credit though for pointing out a few things that viewers might not notice, like how Itto gave Daigoro a certain look in the well scene to figure out how deep it was and how much danger Daigoro was in. There are also program notes about the HD remastering, and a cool Restoration Gallery where you can see the improvement in picture quality from the old dvd and bootlegs compared to this blu-ray. Finally is the infamous trailer that most people have seen.    Overall the blu-ray is definitely worth picking up. While I do like the first three Lone Wolf movies better, for their plot and the less datedsoundtrack (the music here reminded me of Halloween 3: Season of the Witch's soundtrack), there's no denying that Shogun Assassin gets the job done. It was actually hard to review this since most people on this page have probably already seen the movie, and know what they're getting into. But for those who've never seen the movie, I think you'll be in for quite a treat.
0756405890|4.0|The enjoyment of books is more complex than it might seem at first. There are books that are awful. They have cliched characters, shallow plots and poor writing. These are book that are never going to be enjoyable. There are other books where you have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy the book. The first time I read Umberto Eco's [[ASIN:015603297X Foucault's Pendulum]] I didn't like the book. I read it a few years later and loved it.<br /><br />The first time I read The Name of the Wind I checked it out of the library. I gave the book three stars and this is what I wrote:<br /><br />After the first 20 pages I almost put the book down.  But then I read on.  The characters had some depth and the story seemed interesting.  But the story went on and on and the main character kept acting in a foolish manner.  After 600 pages I just didn't care enough to read the next book.<br /><br />Amazon had the book on sale for the Kindle Reader and I bought a copy. Reading it again, I really liked the book.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss is a good writer. I find his characters engaging and the plot is interesting. As I wrote in the first review, the central character, Kvothe, does indeed to a lot of stupid things. In fact, he seems to specialize in not thinking about consequences. On the other hand, he's very young. He is also brilliant and talented and is very aware of the fact. With this reading, Kvothe's immaturity didn't bother me as much.  I upped my rating from three stars to four.<br /><br />Why not five stars? If Rothfuss where not such a good writer, the plot could be described as plodding. The Name of the Wind is an engaging book, but the span of Kvothe's life that the book covers is relatively small. The book describes his path to The University, his admission and his struggles as a student. The later part reminded me a bit of the book The Paper Chase about Harvard Law School (the book was made into a movie). Except that instead of law, the students mainly study the science of magic. When the book ends Kvothe still has not turned eighteen.<br /><br />With this pace, it is not clear to me that Rothfuss will be able to cover all of Kvothe's many adventures in the three books he has planned.<br /><br />Although the book is an enjoyable read, a lot of the plot is redundant. It could have been compressed into the major events of Kvothe's University career and then moved on to his later adventures. We can all hope that the most important events in our lives happen after we graduate from University.<br /><br />I liked The Name of the Wind enough to buy the second book, [[ASIN:B00475AYJQ The Wise Man's Fear]], which I am reading now. The second book was published in 2011. Reading Rothfuss' blog I see that the third book has no publication date on the horizon in April 2017.

0553801473|1.0|I felt this book was just awful and will now stop reading this series.  It offended me that reviewers thought him to be an American Tolkien when his writing and vision are so far from what Tolkien created.  Tolkien created a deep world full of challenges and magic and hope in what is good. Not to mention that his writing was transcendent.<br /><br /> Martin creates a brutal world where babies are eaten by wargs and murders are featured as main characters and morality has little meaning.  Who really cares what happens to many of these petty characters and who cares who wins the battle for this world?  Not me any longer.  Horrible and meaningless to me.  Nothing at all to compared with Tolkien.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|Most of the characters in this film are cardboard cutouts of little used comic characters.  That said, this is a pretty good movie saved by the main actors who are good in it. I like the conceit of mutants role in history. The two also pull off how a disagreement of approach leads where it does.  I played the in-movie extra and it worked well to explain some fun elements of the movie. The mutant detector isn't worth much. I wish there was a commentary. But, still a fine film.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|To start with, the 405cx can sync with Garmin's site through a bluetooth adapter, so I just need to go near the computer, and it will sync automatically. Once the info is on the Garmin site, I can replay my workout looking at speed, heart rate and elevation. I can relive the pain in great detail that way. Because the Garmin site keeps all of the GPS information, you can save routes to use like a standard 'course.' I've baselined a couple and run 'against' them.<br /><br />One of the features on the watch I use frequently is called 'Virtual Partner.' Basically you set a pace, and the watch will roll through a page showing you how far ahead of (or behind) that pace you are. Another feature I find helpful is the 'auto lap,' which allows me to create a lap every so many miles or minutes. It's interesting to see how the run progresses over time in terms of effort.<br /><br />I can also set up to three custom 'pages,' each with different types of information on it. For example, I have two: one with data for the overall run (time, average pace and distance), and then one for the current lap (average pace and time). The HRM page is configurable, too, so I've added the percentage as well as the actual. You can always have an HRM page. Once I start the workout, all I have to do to switch between the pages is touch the watch's bezel. There is also and 'auto scroll' mode, so you don't have to touch the watch.<br /><br />The watch has two modes--running and biking--and remembers the setting for each mode. That way, I can have one auto lap setting for running (1m, say) and another for biking (10m, e.g.).<br /><br />I'm not sure I would use this in a triathlon because switching between running and biking mode takes a little effort.<br /><br />There are some items that 'take some getting used to.' Garmin will tell you the touch bezel is easy to use, and it does allow for easier access to menus and features, but it requires a little practice to get right...definitely not something Iwould experiment with during the run. Also sweat can make the bezel inop, so I usually lock the watch in 'auto scroll' mode and go.<br /><br />One 'feature' I don't care for is that it's not possible to delete a workout. If you inadvertently start the workout, which is easy to do with the bezel locked, that 2.63s workout is there for-freaking-ever. You can generally avoid this if you're careful.<br /><br />The watch holds a charge pretty well. I can get about 6 to 8 hours of GPS-enabled workout per charge, and the watch only required about an hour or maybe two to charge completely. It's a little tricky, because you have to plan a little--I've started out only to find I had limited battery left. On one run, the watch just died, so I didn't get any of my precious data.<br /><br />Overall I'd give this watch 4 or 4.5 stars (out of 5). I picked it up at Amazon for a song (Gold Box) because their latest version is the 410, and they still had an inventory of these watches. I'm perfectly willing to be a rev back.<br /><br />As an alternative, the Garmin 110 is much, much simpler. I recently bought the 110 for my wife. If you just want to strap on the watch and get your speed, time and heart rate, the 110 is less expensive, and for the luddites out there, much less frustrating. The 110 is strictly a running watch, and doesn't have the Virtual Partner, but can upload to the Garmin site, so it's possible to analyze afterward if desired.<br />I've been using the watch for three months, so I probably have 50 to 60 workouts in that time, and would definitely recommend the watch.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|When I read through Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.....I read because the story was interesting and I wanted to see how it all ends. Entertaining and fun though you have to plod through large portions of it to get to those parts. Same with George R Martin's books and most any other fantasy series. Each tell a good story, and you read to see how the story ends.     But take a story like Lord of the Rings....since its the standard by which all fantasy and fairy story is weighed against. LoTR is a story you don't read. It's a story you get sucked into and become a part of. It wasn't the Fellowship of the Nine. It's the Fellowship of the Ten and I am the tenth member. You aren't reading that story just to get to the ending, to find out how all it turns out. You read the story for the journey. You fall in love with the land and with the characters to the point where reading through the book again for a second time (or the dozenth time) is like....coming home.     For me....the Kingkiller Chronicles has more in common with THAT (LOTR) kind of story as opposed to the Robert Jordan or George R Martin books. It's the first series I have read in a long time where I actually cared for the characters. I mean, really cared....what happened to them. It's the type of caring that resulted in a choked up throat when you read of Samwise Gamgee's devotion to Frodo or the feelings of exultation when Aslan kills the White Witch.     Needless to say, I loved the book. Kvothe is a great character, with several great supporting characters. I love the story within a story concept told here too. Reading the story of Kvothe's past through his eyes, knowing there has to be some sort of culmination in the present coming.....awesomeness.     I understand this is going to be a trilogy. If so, I hope the third book is two thousand pages long.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I've liked Aaron Sorkin's other series for years, and hated when Sports Night was cancelled, and after that, Studio 60.  But I never watched West Wing when it was on TV.  Several friends who know of my preference for the other series, said I had to get it, so I'd been watching this on Amazon for a while, and was delighted when it was in the double digit price range on a gold box deal.  I snagged it right away.<br /><br />First of all, the physical presentation is outstanding.  Very nice box, with magnets inside to help it snap shut without anything cluttering the smooth look of it.<br />Folders for each season are well done, folding out several times to encompass all the discs for each season.<br /><br />So far I've gone through about 20 of the discs, and have had no issues.  English subtitles are there if you want them (someone's post from a while ago said there were none, so that may have just been something added since that review) and all the discs were in mint condition and played without any issue.<br /><br />The series itself I won't bother reviewing, since there's over three hundred other reviews that go into it, but I will say it is among the best of any of the TV shows I've ever seen, but that was to be expected considering how much I liked Studio 60 and Sports Night.  Actors were fantastic, story lines were engaging, and most importantly, you get attached to the characters, and feel invested in what's happening to them.  An absolute must for me to enjoy anything is that ability for the writers to pull you into their little universe and make you CARE.<br /><br />I'm glad I was finally able to get hold of the discs, but even more pleased that it was so artfully done with this package.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|Spartacus \\"Gods of the arena\\" : First of all I paid in pre order 38$ for this DVDs and now I see that the price has been reduced. After: the first season was aired with many episode more (this one only 6) and this season is much poor as show and action. I rated the first season 5 stars, this one 1 star.

B002NEFL8W|5.0|I was first skeptical about this Battery grip and how it might screw up my camera if something would go wrong! but upon reading other reviews, I got some confidence of trying this product! Please forget about reviews that gave 2 or 3 stars!!! I think they are missing the bigger picture and how they could actually affect a person's mind in dropping off the idea of purchasing this item. This works great and fits the Canon EOS 7D like a glove fits a hand. It not only gives a great feel of the grip but works so well for portraits. All the hassles of turning around the camera for portraits and then searching for the trigger button and turning the pictures into a blurry ones, can now be greatly reduced. The provision of 2 battery slots is a huge plus. I'm very glad to have purchased this Canon BG-E7 Battery grip[[ASIN:B002NEFL8W Canon BG-E7 Battery Grip for the EOS 7D Digital SLR Camera (Retail Package)]]

B004ZGI1V0|5.0|This movie was really good.  Mystery wrapped in action wrapped in WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?  Good stuff right up to the end, when all is explained.  You'll spend this whole movie trying to solve the mystery and I bet you'll be surprised by the ending.  Neeson is awesome and brings a great element to every role.  A perfect fit for this movie.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|I was really surprised by this movie.  Admittedly I rented it just to kill time, but it turned out to be really cool.  It is filmed similarly too Blair Witch, though this one didn't make me seasick.  It's about a group of students who confront a man accused of poaching bears in Norway, only to find out he actually works for the Norwegian government tracking trolls.  The story line was very inventive.  The effects were pretty good and keep it above an average B movie.  The acting was really good, and the twist at the end was great too.  If you can bare subtitles (part of the film is in english too) and like monster type movies, you'll probably like this film.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app gives access to several different translations of the Bible, footnotes, and a plethora of devotionals. I only wish you could still reference the Biblical text when off-line. Perfect for referencing passages when out and about, or great for leading Sunday school.
B005DD7H50|4.0|I'm on the fence about Bradley Cooper in general, but his work here and in the A Team is excellent.  This film has an original idea that is kind of out there but they make it work.  Appearances by DeNiro class up any film.  Great effects and action filled story keep you interested.  Rock on Mr. Cooper.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Everyone has covered the topic in great detail, but I for one refuse to purchase this abomination for the sole reason that Lucas refuses to include the original versions of Episodes IV-VI.  I won't bother debating because I respect those who aren't bothered by the changes.  Until Lucas care enough about the fan base to give them what they deserve, count me out.
B000PMG16U|2.0|Do you remember the hype that was Episode I?    I remember hearing rumors early in the 90's that the long anticipated prequels would happen, many years passed before I caught my first glimpse of Episode I on a grainy over the air broadcast of Entertainment Tonight. Those next few months were agonizing since I couldn't wait to see the first Star Wars film in 16 years, however there was a question that I feared, what if it sucks?    Well, unfortunately we all know how the prequels turned out and they are a pale imitation of the vastly superior original trilogy (pre-special edition screw ups).    By 1999, Lucas was no longer a filmmaker and was a savvy business man who knows how to make a buck (or a billion) and made the prequels as two hour long commercials to sell more toys that bare the Star Wars name.    The plot was convoluted, the acting was stiff and wooden under his direction, annoying comic relief (I'm looking at you Jar Jar), and the special effects were not that special. Call me old fashioned but the slick look of CGI is jarring and takes me out of the action, give me props, models and costumes!    The movies were marginally better with each release with Episode III the only one I would consider re-watching at this point (not completely void of cringe worthy moments).    I don't completely hate the films, there are a few things that I do enjoy but as a whole, I just can't get into 'em anymore!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, which I thought was well done and technically interesting. Never thought that I would sit through an \\"animated\\" movie but, then, Avatar is different. I enjoyed the additional scenes of the Collector's Edition, but I also recommend the Blu-ray/DVD edition of the original movie.
0307887898|5.0|The Lean Startup is a book that describes a methodology for creating successful startups and innovations.  This book sets itself apart from other business books not only due to its content and clarity, but also because there are so many useful examples.  If you are the sort of person who likes real-world, practical examples that support a cohesive theory, this book is for you.  Eric writes about his own extensive startup experiences, and also about the experiences of many other well-known companies that he interviewed, including Groupon, Facebook, Intuit, Zappos, and many others.  If your work or interests are related to business, innovation, or creating a new product or idea, you will surely find great value in reading this book.
0307887960|1.0|Take it from an Exercise Physiologist, you can't trick your body into burning fat (nor do you need to). If you severely restrict your body of carbohydrates, you WILL lose weight in a rapid fashion. Only problem is, it WON'T BE FAT WEIGHT that you are rapidly losing. If you value your muscle mass and the energy and fluid content that makes your muscles strong and gives them endurance, low carb is not the way to go. If you value an active, healthy metabolism, low carb is not the way to go. The reason millions of people have bought into the idea of low carb diets is the fact that you do get rapid weight loss. However, this is only because your body burns up muscle glycogen (stored sugar in the muscles that holds a large amount of water in the muscle cells)causing a rapid loss of weight (water) in the first several weeks on a low carb diet. Once this glycogen depletion is reached, the rapid \\"weight loss\\" ends, and a slowed metabolism is created. This is a survival response by the body to what it percieves as starvation, even if you are taking in plenty of calories from other food sources. Not only will you have less endurance for glycogen demanding exercise (endurance activities and high intensity activity), but you will have trouble losing any more \\"weight\\" as you pursue more fat loss. Once you give up on such a diet (which you will because it will stop \\"working\\") you will rapidly gain back the lost weight as your muscles replenish their glycogen reserves and fluid content (this is a good thing) allowing the metabolism to return to normal as it leaves what it percieved as a fight against starvation (the brain and nervous system preffer and require sugar). Also, any suggestion that the body's ability to turn protein into sugar makes up for not eating adequate carbohydrates is psuedoscience, and is not based on what is healthy, ideal, or fuctional for the body on a long-term basis. An active, exercising person will not be able to supply adequate sugar to feed an active metabolism by relying on the coversion of dietary protein into sugar within the body. Muscle tissue itself will begin to be broken down as this process is attempted (turning muscle protein into sugar), while all the while the muscles will become energy depleted lowering their ability to sustain calorie-burning exercise or an active metabolism.etabolism by relying on the coversion of dietary protein into sugar within the body.

B005DZMODI|4.0|The pairing of music legends like Eric Clapton and  Wynton Marsallis should be enough of an appeal to people to listen to this disc. I have to agree that the sound quality is not that best on this disc on some tracks. I could barely make out the sound on the track \\"Joe Turner's Blues\\". The postive aspect is that I still enjoyed most of this music. My favorite track is \\"Ice Cream\\". Wynton's trumpet playing is superb. I also like Victor Goines playing on the clarinet.  \\"The Last Time\\" is a delightful tune with a playful tone.  The horns playing on this track makes it special. Eric's vocals are really indistinct on \\"Layla\\".  I could barely hear him, but I could clearly hear the trumpet and electric guitar playing on this track. \\"Just A Closer Walk With Thee\\" is a  gospel song I would hear in church.  The church version I usually hear puts me to sleep.  The blues version featured on this disc is a  cool satisfying listen.  \\"Kidman's Blues is that rare upbeat blues song.  What I like about this song would have to be the lively piano playing by Dan Nimmer. \\"Joilet Bound\\" is a song that I can see myself listening to while driving on the road.  \\"Careless Love\\"is a track that I have heard from female singers.  This version has a more reflective tone.  I like Clapton's vocals here.  The music is fine, even though the sound quality on some tracks is not always crisp on this disc.

0156030306|4.0|When I was a teenager, this book was a frequent choice among my peers, along with \\"The Bell Jar\\" and \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.\\"  I read the other two books during those years, but found the literary exploration of institutions and mental disabilities not to be for me, and so I passed on \\"Algernon.\\"  I'm glad I did; it might have thrown me into a suicidal depression during those years of teenage angst.  Teenagers are emotionally vulnerable, and this book packs a wallop.  It was the death a few days ago of Cliff Robertson, the star of \\"Charly,\\" the movie adapted from the book, that brought me to \\"Algernon,\\" and I rather wish it hadn't.  The book is brilliant, with flashes of genius; it deserves its high rank in the modern American canon.  It is also relentlessly dark and unflinchingly fatalistic, as the author drags us without pity to a conclusion so black that to call it \\"heartbreaking\\" would be to sugarcoat it. The ending is intellectually honest, I suppose, but the story is, after all, science fiction; did the author need to be quite so earthbound in his depiction of the human condition?  I'll dock it a star for its lack of balance and recommend it to adults, but not to those still developing emotionally.  With the problems teenagers already have in realizing that their parents are not gods but just vulnerable people with feet of clay, the depiction of the mother in this book is not something I'd be willing to put into young ones' hands.
B004EPZ070|1.0|Same old story - 'A' loves 'B', 'B' loves 'C', 'C' does not know whom to love etc....  Totally unimaginative story of a smart American Male and/or Female feels shy to show his/her feelings/love to the right partner.  Lots of drama - drama of cheating, adultery, dishonesty and things of that nature this movie will be right up your alley.     Do rent if you want to be terribly bored.  I gave \\"one star\\" since I rented it from RedBox for $1.08, which I think is \\"total\\" waste - if I would get it \\"free\\" then probably I would go for \\"two star\\" - probably.... who knows!!!

0552998931|3.0|Vianne is seeking a different life for her daughter, Anouk, than the one of her own childhood, one in which Vianne and her mother were constantly on the run staying a step ahead of those who viewed their practice in magic as an afront to commuinity norms.  Vianne settles into the small Lansquent, France on the day of Carnival, opens a chocolate shop, and does her best to create a normalcy for her daughter without abandoning her values.  Unfortunatley, the town priest sees everything about Vianne and her chocolate shop as a direct threat to the community, the church's festivals, and the sacraments.  I mean imagine a chocolatier actually making chocolate eggs and bunnies for Easter!<br /><br />I'm going to apologize upfront here.  I'm going to get sappy on you.  From an objective point of view this is not a work I would normally enjoy and gush over.  However, on so many levels I just connected with the story and Vianne.  First, for those of you who follow me on FB you know how much I love to cook.  For me the soul of the family can be found in the kitchen.  This comes from spending so much time in the kitchen with my mother and grandmother until just a couple of years ago.  I loved how Harris used a confectioner as a means to chase away demons, heal wounds, bring people together, and act as an equalizer amont the community.  Harris depicts not only the inherited magic Vianne uses to see into the soul of the townspeople, but she compares her skill in the kitchen to magic, \\"there is a kind of alchemy in the transformation of base chocolate into this wise fool's gold, a layman's magic that even my mother might have relished.\\" (pg 53) . Secondly, I understand how difficult it can be to move into a small town and try to ingratiate yourself into it.  Finally, I also just absolutely loved some of the characters, particularly Armande Voizin, an elderly woman with a long memory of the priest's past.<br /><br />this being said, the themes are superficial and the actions incredibly predictable.  I really think it is my own experiences that endears this work to my heart.  I may finally understand the concept of a guilty pleasure?ble.

B002ZG99TK|3.0|It's a cliche to point it out, I guess, but cliches became cliches for a reason, and there's still pleasure to be had when they're put across with the skill and conviction of this runaway train saga.  There probably isn't a moment in \\"Unstoppable\\" that we don't see coming down the track from a long way off but, in the age of Michael Bay (not to single out the poor man), an old-school action movie that takes place in the \\"real world\\", sans robots, vampires, wizards or excessive CGI, is a welcome relief. Just a crafty, fun entertainment for those evenings when you wish you were as brave and wise and competent an engineer as Denzel Washington. Hope there's no sequel, though (\\"Unstoppable II: Snakes on a Train!\\").

B0055EAJ7A|4.0|There have been enough reviews about the movie itself for months now, so this is basically going to be about the actual three-disc combo (though I know I'll probably stray off track).  I will say that I did like the movie on its own, and that all of the actors did a great job making you feel that each group belonged in their respective environments (ie:  Odin, Loki, Sif & the Warriors Three belonged in the heavens, and everyone on earth belonged on earth, and Chris Hemsworth did a fantastic job bulking up for the role.  I still don't know where all of the hate came from originally when he was cast).    I saw this movie in theaters in 3D, and thought that it had just the right mix of 3D to enhance the movie without making it overbearing, and throwing it in your face scene after scene.   Not that there's anything wrong with that (those types of movies are a lot of fun, too), and the 3D was definitely better than some of the other movies I've seen where the 3D was added post production.  The scenes flowed well in the theaters and when I watched it at home, the 3D effects still looked awesome.  I will admit that you can still tell when a movie is originally shot in 3D (Resident Evil looks awesome every time I watch it) versus being converted after the fact, but Thor definitely shows that studios are learning from their prior mistakes (I remember thinking that some scenes in Clash of the Titans almost looked like a pop up book, with a flat surface on top of a flat surface).    I also had a chance to listen to the commentary by Kenneth Branagh, and I have always liked how he is very articulate, and gives insight both on the actual production of the film, as well as his own experience with the actors.  There are several featurettes on the production of the film, a bunch of deleted scenes (which I haven't had time to watch yet), and a short with Agent Coulson having a discussion with another agent regarding events that happened in The Incredible Hulk, and even though it's nothing big, it was still entertaining.   All in all, if you enjoy the novelty of watching 3D movies at home, the three disc combo is a great way to go (the 3D Blu-Ray disc only contains the movie itself.  The regular Blu-Ray disc has the non-3D movie as well as the special features).  If you're not into the 3-D, the movie is still entertaining (I did watch it in 2D for the commentary).  I will admit that I love comic book movies, and I am biased toward them.  I really enjoyed the Iron Man movies and Captain America, and even The Hulk, and Thor was a solid 4, right between Cap and The Hulk.    The quality of these movies is definitely making me hungry for The Avengers next year.  Here's hoping for a 2 1/2 hour movie with a 3 hour special Joss Whedon Director's Cut on 3D Blu-Ray! :)    One quick addition.  I read a few reviews that complained about the 3D (and like I said, you can tell the 3D was added post production, so it's not going to be as brilliant as Resident Evil 3D, but it was still done well), and how during the dark scenes it was almost useless (like the scenes in the lair of the frost giants), so I went back and re-watched those scenes in 3D, and I still say it looks good.  Again, not phenomenal, but still impressive.  I've got a Toshiba 55\\" 3D TV, so it's not an ultra high end, and those scenes still looked pretty good to me.  I could still see the difference in depth they were going for, and it looked pretty clear.  Then you have the scenes in Asgard, which are breathe taking in their grandeur.  So I still say, get the 3D version if you have a 3D TV, especially since the price difference is currently like $3.  If it were a lot more expensive, then I could totally see why you consider getting the normal Blu-Ray version.

0060920084|2.0|This book reads more like a \\"why I miss England\\" book. For most of the book, he complains about every part of America he drives through. True, while there are plenty of boring places, and the \\"old town\\" lifestyle that Bryson loved so much in Iowa no longer existed by the time he took his tour in the 1980s, there really is no need to make the harsh comparisons between American and England. Each place has its own merits and faults. In all honesty, I think this book would be best read by someone not from America who wants to get a baised opinion about what is wrong with the country. There is little that is funny in the book (I laughed twice--total). I bought the book hoping for a great and laugh-out-loud story like \\"Thunderbolt Kid.\\" I was sorely dissappointed.

1594744769|4.0|I don't like horror stories. But this story wasn't a horror story as people think of them, it was an adventure that drew me in with the grandfather's stories and the pictures. They were so well incorporated that they really weren't just illustrations they were an integral part of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. It's not a story for little kids, it is one that will make you look for shadows in broad daylight.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Ok let me get this out of the way FIRST & FOREMOST! Ultimately these are George Lucas' films and he can do whatever the hell he wants to do with them, this I understand. What I don't understand, is him constantly making CONTENT CHANGES, not corrections, BUT CONTENT CHANGES & then passing them off to the fans of the movies as what he always envisioned. Really George, do you think I'm that stupid, really? honestly?! There are fans out there who are going to buy these anyway & to those fans I say, this proves that George can wholesale alter (or in my view slaughter) dramatic content in his movie (namely Jedi) & you will still buy it, well this is the last straw for me. I was excited about this set, but i've cancelled my pre-order. The only way he is going to get the hint people is by not buying it, I mean if it looks like a duck & quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck!!!    The reason is that now he's screwed up the whole purpose of Return of the Jedi. The whole movie is basically summed up start, middle & end with the last act of Jedi, but so much for that. What George SHOULD HAVE done is exactly what Ridley Scott did with the Blade Runner blu-ray, include every version in the set, all 3 theatrical versions of Star Wars, Empire & Jedi, the 1997 theatrical re-release special editions & his tinkered version. Make it a humongous set, load it up with extras on each disc with the movies and with extra discs & said here.   Now that is something I would have been in the front of the line for. Not some Hack job re-do that he is trying to pass off as the movie he wanted to release. Too bad all he has is yes men that work for him. I'll just save my $90 and put it towards the Indiana Jones Movies on Blu-Ray when they finally get released. One saving grace is at least Steven Spielberg has the balls to tell George no.

B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Lady Antebellum is country music for folks who don't much like country music.    The stars are pretty, they sing pretty, and the songs have a way of getting stuck in your head.  The subject matter is relationships, and they are most convincing when the relationships are going well.  When things go sour (Wanted You More), you just know happy times are right around the corner.  It is fitting that the most compelling song on this CD is the final track, Heart of the World, in which they express pure contentment.    I enjoy listening to Lady Antebellum but can't help feeling that they need to do some living before their music truly takes hold of my heart and won't let go.  Is this music I want to hear repeatedly?  Absolutely, in fact the first thing I did was play the CD straight through twice.  This is the band who gets up in the  romantic comedy starring (insert big names here) and plays the song when the two leads realize they love each other.  To my mind Lady Antebellum consists of great performers but not yet great artists.  I truly hope they stay together for a long time, I would like to see what develops.
B00579EL18|4.0|Corelli's pale '70s recordings of the title role (1970 and 1972 in Vienna and at the Met respectively), where he sounds embarrassingly overparted, can in no way compare with this magnificent 1964 Carlo from the Met. Rysanek's Elisabetta is rather matronly, but she's in glorious voice. Dalis - known to us mainly from her Bayreuth Kundry - is a sympathetic Eboli (rightly flirtatious in the Veil Song and unbearably regretful in 'O don fatale'). Uhde (Grand Inquisitor) - another Wagnerian - matches Tozzi (Filippo) note for note: the latter tends to declaim (rather than sing) some of his lines (including 'Ella giammai m'amo'), but it's still a moving characterization. The little-known Herlea sings Posa: not as graceful as (say) Bastianini's, a trifle wobbly and loud but not entirely forgettable. The Monk is sung by the young Diaz (one wishes that he and Herlea had reversed roles). The recording's sound quality is acceptable: good soloist-chorus-orchestra balance. But the cuts are annoying, given the fact that Adler used an almost complete text at the same house nine years earlier (Tucker, Steber, Thebom, Bastianini, and Hines). If you don't have a Corelli CARLO, get this one and ignore his '70s recordings; however, if for any reason (eg Janowitz's Elisabetta or Talvela's Inquisitor) you can't resist the Vienna performance (sonically superior to this one), make sure you don't even touch his 1972 Met CARLO issued on Living Stage (a shameful release, poorly recorded and sung).

B0002XMF62|5.0|The Eternal Idol (1987) is a gem of an album that hadn't garnered enough respect from its initial release until now. I'd like to think that that attitude is changing now. Sure, many of the Sabbath \\"purists\\" were turned off when Ozzy was fired, or don't like it when Geezer is not always in the lineup, but this album still holds its own. Yes, Tony Martin is no Ozzy, but he nevertheless does a stellar job. A lot of the songs are melodic, though hard-hitting. The album comes out swinging with THE SHINING, which is a good hard-rocker. The same can be said about ANCIENT WARRIOR, HARD LIFE TO LOVE and GLORY RIDE, the latter sounding a little like Triumph. There is some residual sound from their previous release, Seventh Star, released a year earlier, as the songs have a more commercial sound to them. Anyway, darkness starts to set in for the second half of the album, with NIGHTMARE, the acoustic instrumental, SCARLET PIMPERNEL, and the title track. The title track (ETERNAL IDOL) is easily the best song on the album, and depicts the signature doom-and-gloom Sabbath sound. This song alone is worth the price of the album. When listening to this album, I think of a band who went into the studio with an attitude of \\"We've got nothing to lose.\\" This album isn't uptight, desperate or hastily done. This is one great effort by Black Sabbath. 9/10

Also across the United States in New York a new young competitor emerges, Lou Ferrigno, a former Mr. Universe and veiwed as the biggest threat to Arnold.     This Docu-Drama exposes the world to the arrogant, but playful Arnold Schwarzengger, the young and naive Lou Ferrigno, Arnold's loyal best friend, but fierce rival competitor Franco Columbo, and many more colorful characters! This is an absolute must watch for any bodybuilder, or fan of bodybuilding, or any fan of great film making.     Has tons of special features that include a behind the sceens look, a Q&A with Arnold regarding the most memorable moments from \\"Pumping Iron\\" and a 25 year reunion of the entire cast and how they perceive this film now.     This still is the Greastest inside look you can get into Bodybuilding while getting to know the names that made this sport so famous!
0684857219|5.0|I received this as a Christmas present some years back, and after dedicating a few months to bodybuilding training (I already had the background of weight lifting), I entered my first contest. If you have any interest in bodybuilding competitively or as a hobby, this is a must read; all things bodybuilding stem from this book.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|Finally, the cycle is complete: the fourth of the Big 4 bands that defined thrash metal in the 1980s is back in top form! Anthrax followed Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer into decline after the great \\"Sound of White Noise\\" in the 1990s, and it is the last to return to greatness (though \\"We've Come for You All\\" was also quite good). And what a return it is! Sure, I miss John Bush, too, but Joey Belladonna seems to have gained more control over his voice in his years away from Anthrax (or perhaps while touring with them a few years ago...), and his singing here is downright impressive. In addition, the combination of the mixture of Anthrax's 1980s thrash and 1990s power (macho? grungy? what was that style called?) metal on \\"Worship Music\\" is only just short of brilliant. Stand-out songs are \\"The Devil You Know,\\" \\"Fight 'Em Til You Can't,\\" and \\"Revolution Screams.\\" Whatever the crazy story behind the years-long recording of this album, if Anthrax needs to stumble and juggle singers again for years to produce another one like this, I'm all in favor!

1609611543|5.0|Do not buy this book if you want to continue being happy with sandwiches, cookies, cereal, and all other processed 'frankenwheat' products.  Do not buy this book if you want to continue dealing with the health issues caused by eating grains.  Do not buy this book if you prefer to continue to believe the government's My Plate eating plan.    While Dr. Davis' book has a lot of scientific, research related information that can bog you down at times, it needs to be read so that you can understand the whole concept of the book.  While Dr. Davis is not the first one to preach the grain=bad message, his approach is all proved out by the research.  Does it make sense that even though the low-fat, high-'whole'grain message is being preached by our government and being followed more and more that obesity is epidemic and diabetes is probably one of the fastest growing health problems in the U.S.?  Someone's lying to us somewhere and since the \\"Big Grain\\" lobby is very active on Capitol Hill, my guess is that a lot of people have been sold a big fat lie about the 'health benefits' of grain.  Dr. Davis exposes a tremendous amount of 'bad science'.    It's significant that almost immediately upon publication of the book, it, and the Dr. were attacked by the grain growers associations in an attempt to discredit him and his research.    Read the book and then you can judge.  Or just go to your local Walmart/Safeway/Kroger & see if  there might be a relationship between carts loaded down with bread/cereal/processed foods and the weight of the people pushing the cart.    I bought the Kindle edition but am also ordering a hardcopy to share with others.
B005DJRD80|5.0|Not sure exactly what hooked me to this show - the good looking characters, the witty one liners, the show stealing mother of the main character Jenna or Jenna herself.  You really see life through her eyes and that is quite hilarious - it reminds me a lot of, not as much Juno like the other reviewer mentioned, but maybe more My so called life - but funnier and not quite as dramatic - girl likes boy, girl has competition for boy, boy likes girl but many dilemmas ensue of course- I would definitely check it out - I'm glad I did!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Remember the last good movie Matthew McConaughey was in?  You have to reach back a way, but it was Time to Kill, where he played a lawyer whose life gets turned upside down after taking a high profile case in which there are questions of the defendant's actual guilt.  It should come as no surprise then, that his role as Mick Haller - a slick-talking, deal-cutting, lowlife-defending criminal defense lawyer whose life gets turned upside down after taking a nearly identical case (at least outwardly) - produces a crisp, if somewhat unoriginal, movie high on intense legal thrills and unsolved mysteries.  The primary dissimilarity is rather than superb oratory skills used on a sympathetic jury, Haller uses the flaws and loopholes in the legal system to his advantage in an effort to correct wrongs as he sees them.  This does not gain him favor with the prosecuting attorneys who view Haller as bottom-feeding scum.  Secondary to lawyer differences is the client.  Instead of a poor black man it's a rich white man (Ryan Phillipe as Louis Roulet, perfect casting for the entitled WASP).  The two movies are so similar McConaughey even has a hot wife in this one (Marisa Tomei); although, she's not as hot as her film predecessor (Ashley Judd).  Speaking of Judd, this movie is believable, unlike the legal dramas she's been in.  Which is probably why it's so engrossing.<br /><br />When a man (Roulet) accused of beating a hooker (Hooker), a sleazy bail-bondsman (Leguizamo) gets Haller and his P.I. (Macy) the case.  Once the details begin to get exposed, mystery and truth is revealed.  As the shady deals, criminal informants, and plot twists unravel, The Lincoln Lawyer displays how a superb mystery can be crafted without a ton of extraneous fluff thrown in for no other reason than masturbatory screen-writing.<br /><br />An all around fine film that has very little room for improvement.  Highly recommended.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I have had this for about 2 months and TOTALLY loved it.  Recommended it to all my friends.  My Mom got one and loves it.  My other friend was going to get one and then told me he read bad reviews about it breaking in half at the middle of the pole.      Well today mine just broke in half too!  It was not being handled roughtly at all and just snapped.  The plastic in the middle apparently is just a bad design and broke just like my friend read about.    I call Ontel (makers), they said if it is with in 90 days I can pay to ship it back and pay $12 to have it fixed.  Or I can pay $9 to have a new pool sent to me.    What a crock of crap!  Why pay more money to have it fixed or buy a new pole when it is just going to snap again!  Ontel has a bad product and they are just going to ignore it.    It is a shame because I really do love this thing.     I would say do not buy this unless you are handy and can fix the handle when it breaks.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|For a long time, Suede was one of my favourite british bands, and all the hype around them and the beginning of britpop was easily explanaible.  Such a gorgeous album, and now in a specially remastered deluxe edition!  A full dvd with concerts and clips, and lots of b sides in addition to one of their best albuns, plus a booklet full of photos and lyrics, for only USD 20,00?  For me, it was a bargain for such an import tittle!

The cover alone is disgusting.  No matter how far we get,there's always something trying to take us back to those days.  Here's a secret....YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THOSE DAYS AGAIN.  So try re-writing another part of history to show yourselves in a different light.  That ones been written.LEAVE IT ALONE.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary takes it back to the beginning, covering a progression of events that help the regular person understand what happened and is happening in our country.  It is a sad realization that we the \\"little people\\" struggle to pay our taxes and do the right thing, when the reality is that \\"it\\" is out of our control.  What is fair about a $450 million dollar \\"parachute\\" and not pay ANY TAXES on it??  If I am one day late paying my payroll taxes, I am fined??  I plan on watching this movie several times, have loaned it to our friends. Unbelievable.  This documentary is so very well done.

0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries is the Peter Drucker of this century and his first book, The Lean Startup, lays the foundation for the future of entrepreneurship.  In it he elegantly summarizes what he has taught and learned in the crowd-sourced Lean Startup movement over the past 3 years:  startups are a discovery process and we entrepreneurs need a new management science that maximizes our probability of success.    There are a number of well-written general reviews here on Amazon so I'll substantiate my 5 star rating by picking one example.      A key principle of The Lean Startup is to organize operations in a way that accelerates the speed at which a startup can change the plan - or pivot - based on validated learning about the market.  Ries suggests having scheduled pivot-or-persist meetings where teams meet to review what they learned and decide whether to persist down the current path or pivot to a new direction.      While exceedingly simple in concept, this one tactic has transformed the chaotic nature of my startup operations into a systematic process where I'm making directed moves towards understanding what product to build for my market.      This is just one example but it is the type of benefit you can expect from The Lean Startup.  I expect CEOs everywhere to distribute copies to their teams.  Companies that don't adopt Lean Startup principles will lose to those that do.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|If you loved the series you will die for this movie!  Fast forward and the girls have moved on with their lives but Carrie is still single, single yet she has the love of her life Mr.Big aka John.! I've watch this movie so many times and I can watch it more.  I don't want to give any spoilers away but it's funny and exciting at the same time. It will also bring you to tears.  Jennifer Hudson is fantastic in this movie! She's actually one of the main characters. I'll say it again, if you love the series you have to buy this movie! Or at least watch it :-)
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|As well as I loved The Prestige as well I think The Illusionist is boring and predictable.<br /><br />The plot, if we can call that a plot, is that two young people love each other and want to end up together.<br /><br />There are few magic tricks at all... The Illusionist can bring forth holograms of people, but you hardly get an idea of how he is working to get that result. The film is playing on the principle: Does he have any special ability or is he an illusionist? But without having anything concrete about any of those.<br /><br />At the end of the film, the policeman gets a \\"sight\\", almost like in Usual Suspects, which explains to you in two minutes, how it was done.<br /><br />By this time, you would probably have guessed it and it is a wonder how the policeman gets all these hints from nowhere. Why and how he put all the things together at this precise moment is the only mystery of this movie.<br /><br />Two stars because of the special effects.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I find this very disturbing that Lucas is still tinkering with these films.  You could suppose it is his right to do so however he should give the fans a choice by releasing the unaltered versions.  After all these films now belong to the fans just as much as they do to Lucas.  I am glad so many people are taking a stand against this latest re-release of these films.   George Lucas has spent the last 25 years destroying his own legacy.  Why doesn't he just do the right thing and release the original theatrical versions for episodes IV-VI? It is the only fare thing to do.

B005F9CPG8|5.0|When this album was announced in 2000, a lot of Beatle fans wondered, \\"Why?\\" Most fans already owned these songs on the [[ASIN:B003YNFYCO 1962-1966 (Red) Remastered]] and [[ASIN:B003YNFYD8 1967-1970 (Blue) Remastered]] collections, not to mention the original albums/CDs, and [[ASIN:B003Y63UJA The Beatles: 20 Greatest Hits [Vinyl LP] [Stereo]]] flopped in the early 1980s (although it did become a steady back-catalog seller later on).<br /><br />Well, thanks to a shrewd marketing campaign by Apple and EMI that targeted younger listeners (which Apple needs to do more of, lest this great music die, before the \\"Glee\\" crowd turns it into hip-hop crap), BEATLES 1 became one of the best selling albums of all time, and led to the release of other career-spanning \\"number 1\\" CDs, such as [[ASIN:B00006AG5N Elv1s 30 #1 Hits]], [[ASIN:B00066N8JI Number Ones]] by The Bee Gees, [[ASIN:B0000DD575 The #1's (Eco-Friendly Packaging)]] by Diana Ross and The Supremes, and other compilations such as The Rolling Stones' [[ASIN:B00006IR69 Forty Licks]].  Even old-time Beatle fans loved the album, because of the convenience of having 27 great #1 songs on a single CD, and the sound quality was far superior to most of the Beatles CDs available at the time.<br /><br />Now, in 2011, BEATLES 1 appears again, using the 2009 remasters.  This reissue simply brings this best-selling album in line with the rest of the catalog.  The packaging has been upgraded, with a digipak (with the Apple logo on the flap) replacing the 2000 version's jewel case, and the booklet is now printed on thicker, glossier paper than the 2000 version.  Some fans may question why more was not added this time (e.g., the B-sides, the non-U.S. and non-U.K. number ones, the solo number ones, a DVD of promo clips, etc.), but I don't think it was Apple's intention to rewrite history at this time.<br /><br />I did not notice any significant differences in sonics between the 2000 and 2011 versions of this CD.  Upon further review, the older version is a little louder in places, and two songs - \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" - do sound slightly, though not overwhelmingly, better.  So, if you have the 2000 version, there probably is no reason for you to upgrade to the new version, unless you are a collector like myself.  But either way, this CD is excellent value for the money - 27 chart-topping classics by the greatest group ever.  As George Martin wrote in the introduction, \\"A wonderful collection, and wonderful for me to have been there.\\"  Wonderful for us too, Sir George.e older version is a little louder in places, and two songs - \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" - do sound slightly, though not overwhelmingly, better.

B0041JMT82|5.0|I love this book!  Don't recommend it for the beginner as some of the instructions are a little vague but for the experienced hooker this book is awesome.  So many cool designs and it's easy to add your own spin on all the great ideas in here.  I love to experiment and I've been looking for a book just like this for awhile.<br />It also includes a small section with artwork giving you a bunch of ideas on how to use the motifs in a finished project.  Many of the ideas are a duh but some I'd never thought of!  Seriously a great find!<br />My only real complaint is the noisy binding.  Keeps Hubby awake when I'm crocheting in bed.

B0058GYP5W|3.0|I ordered the UK import version of the soundtrack several months ago and am very pleased with my purchase.  When it was announced that a version of the disc would be released in the US with a bonus track I got very excited.  I purchased the newer version this week, and was disappointed to see no bonus track on the package, and no bonus on the disc.  Am I missing something?  I know that when discs were en vogue that artist would hide tracks on them using such tricks as pausing after the last track and then fast forwarding to access the bonus content.  Does anyone have any suggestions or know something that I don't?  I give the product three out of five stars based on this misleading information.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|Strange, all of the negative reviews, and this is why:<br /><br />The trailers made it as clear as the nose on your face as to the type of movie this was going to be. There was no guesswork. There were no assumptions to be had or conjectures to assimilate. It was not meant to be rocket-science by any stretch of the hyphenated word. It was CUT-AND-DRY as to what we were to expect from \\"Your Highness.\\"<br /><br />So why, in all that is holy, would the negative-reviewing knuckleheads even remotely entertain the thought of attending a movie like this and then expect anything other that what was in the previews? That puzzle is one for the high-thinkers, the philosophers, those involved with the aesthetics of human thought and its subsequent actions. But I have come up with a few theories of my own concerning those goofballs and their reasoning behind reviewing a movie like this:<br /><br />1. They enjoy negativity and go about life on a day-to-day basis doing everything they can to seek out stuff to criticize and then following through with it.<br />2. They lack self-esteem and need to be critical of anything and everything that contains humor so that those who are subject to their criticism may experience a bit of what they feel deep inside of their afflicted, dismayed, and moth-eaten souls. It probably gives them a brief pseudo-sense of purpose, which, of course, is better than having to live with themselves and listening to their own poisonous thoughts for a brief moment in time.<br />3. They are big pessimistic bags of garbage, spewing darkness into the world on a daily basis, and they really should not be going to movies like this for the simple fact that, in their case, it takes MORE facial muscles to smile than it does to frown.<br /><br />\\"Your Highness\\" had no secrets about the type of movie is was going to be. And everything I expected from it I was given ten-fold. It was hilarious and very tongue-in-cheek at times, it was lewd and crude at other times, and it was bold and meaningful at, still, other times, making for an exceptionally executed movie, rife with hilarity and teeming with nonsensical amusement. The medieval backdrop added wholly to the film's atmosphere as well.<br /><br />Don't listen to the nay-sayers, folks. \\"Your Highness\\" comes recommended to all those who can find their own funny bone without effort. It is for people of substance, who like to escape that substance from time to time. It is for the optimistic, glass-is-half-full type of person. It is for those who have no problem laughing at something that is MEANT for laughter and not lame, thin-lipped dissections.<br /><br />All of the actors in this film were clearly having a good time during filming. Natalie Portman was a knockout and always seemed just a frame or two away from cracking up, and I'm almost positive she did many times after the director yelled, \\"Cut!\\" Danny McBride was perfect in his obsequious and cowardly performance. And James Franco pulled off the good-son, hero role with ecstatic ease. Other prominent actors were spotted throughout and played their parts with perfection.

0060523808|4.0|On the one hand, I thought this was an excellent book. On the other, I feel that Louis cheated the reader and himself by not sharing more about his decision making skills. I found that the most important part of this book was the last third \\"Lessons Learned.\\" It is there that he shared some insight, but again, superficially. He is either one that plays things very close to the vest or has actually made important decisions. In either case, he did not share his insights as well as other books by executives.\\"

0062060554|3.0|I found the whole concept of this book intrguing and from the beginning thought it very engrossing, however, I did feel around 3/4's of the way through that it started to drag. You know how each day for Christina will start and you can only hope she will find out what is going on before she has to go to sleep. I believe there was a whole section that could have been cut out from this book and would not have changed the outcome one bit. The ending was very exciting and a good way to wrap up the story.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Ranks down there with the Punisher and Ang Lee's Hulk. If you wanna have more fun go watch Limitless or Paul. I realize we are still in the Dark Ages and all but the whole point of escapism is just that... to escape a dumbed-down mindless 2 dimensional planet   ... you want action watch Chocolate or Ip Man or something that doesn't just imitate the vacuum of deep space.    Rule #1: When watching a bad movie ALWAYS be prepared to spend another two hours finding a suitable antidote flick to cleanse the cerebral palate of the bland taste of being teased by the promise of infinite technological possibilities juxtaposed against the never ending acceptance of cheese.... (& processed at that)
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Very interesting concept, filmed in a different way too.  It took a moment to get into the film and the way it was directed/filmed but it was good.  You have to really pay attention and follow along, and if you do I think you would find this a very good movie.
0307887960|5.0|A friend lent me Dr. Dukan's book just over a month ago.  I began his diet on August 8th, eating only proteins for five days and lost 3.5 pounds.  One month ago I switched into the Cruise phase and, as of this morning, have lost a total of 10 pounds.  I feel better than I have in years, a sense of balance and well-being that I had forgotten was possible!  Once I meet my target weight, which should be soon, I will enter the Consolidation phase to assure that the weight will not be regained.  By Thanksgiving I plan to have reached the final phase, Permanent Stabilization.  I know that I can do it and never have to diet again.  Thank you Dr. Dukan.
B004OBQQPY|1.0|I bought this expecting it to be the English language edition only to discover the same issue many other reviewers have already mentioned. It is not English language.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Currently, this at the top of my favorite shows.  This is one of two TV shows that my husband and I thoroughly enjoy watching together (the other being 'Supernatural').  I saw the commercial for this in theaters maybe two years ago and it peaked my interest, but I forgot about it.  Then last November or so, we saw it was on Netflix.  We watched this on Netflix and then watched 'Gods of the Arena' as that season progressed.  I think there are only three episodes left on Netflix, but for months we would rewatch this show together from time to time.    I like historical movies/shows and there are often not many that I enjoyed (I tried watching the Tudors a few months ago and didn't get into it).  Spartacus is full of blood and gore and sex.  But the characters are likable (even the one you start out really disliking, which for me was Barka, Crixus, and even Batiatus).    I was not aware of some of the names connected to it when we began to watch.  Then as the names flashed across the screen (Michael Hurst, Chloe Smith, Raimi and Tapert), I would say \\"Hey, it's that guylady that played Iolaus/directed or produced Xena\\".  I was a big fan of Hercules and Xena, though I was a child when the shows were originally on.  This show is like a grown-up, much better version.  And because of the wig, it took me maybe two episodes to recognize Lucy Lawless (who played Xena).  Also, I was amazed to see the guy who played Johnathan in \\"The Mummy\\", which I also loved as a child and still do.  The other actors, that I have never heard of, were amazing as well.    I think the prequel \\"Gods of the Arena\\" is worth a watch, too.  It made me understand and like Lucretia better.  Plus, it was nice to see Batiatus again.    The first episode is a little too \\"300\\" for me, but I still love them all none the less.  I can't wait until Season 3 comes out.  I want to see what happens to the surviving characters.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|After seeing & reviewing 2 so called \\"action movies\\" I can say this is an ACTION MOVIE! Drive Angry is just a fun movie with some good action & fun characters. Directed by Patrick Lussier he directed White Noise 2, he's going to direct Halloween 3D. Stars Nicholas Cage as John Milton, Amber Heard as Piper, Billy Burke as Jonah King, William Ficthner as The Accountant & Tom Atkins as The Police Captain. The story is this guy named John Milton is after this cult lead by Jonah King they killed his daughter & have his infant granddaughter. So he meets this lady named Piper & she gives him ride to town she finds her Fiance Frank cheating on her Frank is actually played by Todd Farmer the script writer. They get in a fight Milton helps Piper & owns Frank. There is some humor to the scene. Milton takes Piper & they head off. You have this guy The Accountant looking for Milton & Frank doesn't answer his questions. He kills Frank & The Cops show up cause Frank reported his car stolen there going to areest him but The Accountant flips a coin & it turns into a FBI badge. Milton Piper are at this hotel & she finds out about Jonah King he's sent his followers to go & kill John Milton. This scene is pretty funny Nicholas Cage is having s                        3                      x with some chick  he met & kills bad guys at the same time.  The next day Milton & Piper are being chased by The Accountant & Milton takes him down with a really awesome gun.the car The Accountant is in is knocked off the bridge. Milton goes to this church where Jonah is at but is shot in the eye. Jonah takes Piper & trys to force her into the cult. Milton gets up goes kills the the cult members left behind & goes  after Jonah Piper escapes. A little bit later on you get a very good scene whit The Police Blockade & where The Accountant uses a gas truck really a well done scene. Funny scene with The Tom Atkins character. Then you get to the finish which was well done the ending was lame though. DriveAngry was pretty good. Patrick Lussier did a good job. Nicholas Cage was good. Amber Heard was good not annoying. William Fitchner wasn't bad. Billy Burke was alright. Tom Atkins had fun with his role. The CGI was pretty bad  I'll admit that but I liked Drive Angry. So next will be another random review.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|I have to say I absolutely love the new album! I didn't spend too much time comparing with other albums or if it sounds like old Primus. This is a great album and the direction the band chose to take. I've been playing it non-stop since I got it and it's a great mix of insanity and genius. The only complaint I have on the album is Les' vocals are a little low in a couple songs. Other than that, the only song that is lacking anything in my opinion is the chorus on Tragedy's a Comin' gets a little old to me, but the rest of the song itself is actually great. I had a smile on my face listening to every song on it and am so pumped to get some new Primus! I definitely recommend this album to any Primus fan, new or old, and recommend to not over-think it and just enjoy!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I just bought full collection of South Park (season 1 to 14)instead of this. People waited for so long to get their hands on BR release and this is what we get? GTFO!    Season Six  Episode:  Free Hat - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Tweek journey to George Lucas's house to save Raiders of the Lost Ark from being another victim to movies remade and ruined by their directors.
B00407PNWO|5.0|It's a wonderfull film.- It has a lot of adventures and humour, and Errol Flynn performs one of the its best role in his career.-
B000002GXS|5.0|This is the same fantastic cd I've had for years. There is not one better. when I read the discription, on this posting, that said \\"The SHM-CD [Super High Material CD] format features enhanced audio quality through the use of a special polycarbonate plastic\\" I thought this had some fantastic new sound but nowhere on this cd or the jacket(inside or outside) does it say anything about this SHM-CD. In fact it is exactly like my original cd, word for word, on the cd and the jacket. So if you have a copy already, You got it. Don't waste your time with this. If you don't have a copy of this, get this one, it's a good price.
030788743X|4.0|this is a solid read - it reads like a really well done videogame, and I don't mean that as an insult. The whole book is a set of journeys that end with a battle against major traps. The fact that person who wrote the ultimate game was obsessed with the 80's allows the author's obsession to take control of the book as well.  the juxtaposition between the real world of the novel and the virtual world of the game ultimately gets lost. Some of the more effective parts of the book are when the main characters are forced to leave the virtual world and have to deal with the ramifications of their actions in the real world. By the end, the book is so caught up in the game that the effects on the real world get pushed aside.  So basically the first 2/3 of this book are very well done, with the last third beginning to show the strain between what has happened before and what the author wants to have happen for a happy ending.    If you like either of Cory Doctorow's YA novels (Little Brother or For the Win), this will be right up your alley.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|This isn't much of a movie, even as a popcorn flick it is only so-so. Natalie Portman is always nice to look at, and the visuals are OK, but this is the visual equivalent of a marshmallow. The fight scenes weren't engaging, and you just don't care about the characters.
B004SBX112|1.0|I still get video ads in the &quot;ad-free&quot; version. What a load of crap.  Why won't Amazon make them fix it?
0810983915|5.0|My 9-yr-old son has read all of the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" books several times.  He says this one is his favorite.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I went to see this movie in theaters as soon as it came out, and I was not disappointed! The action scenes are fantastic and I really liked the story line. The only thing that was a bit of a let-down was...no Megan Fox. I definitely preferred her compared to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. But a great movie overall!
B000MCIBAW|3.0|Yes, I used to manage rock bands (low to mid level, which do you think paid best? hehe). And yes there were some of these bands that incorporated Doors songs into their set, an obvious favorite being \\"Love me Two Times\\" and (to a lesser extent, but hey it increased during the popularity of the movie \\"Lost Boys\\") \\"People are Strange.\\"<br /><br />Maybe this require some context. Yes, \\"Strange Days\\" is the second full album by the Doors. And James Morrison was a rhythmic - if not particularly melodic - singer. Brooding charisma, yeah we've heard it all before. Where's the precision in his delivery? Ray Manzarek was not the greatest keyboard player of all time, and I've handled many who were his superior in every way. Robby Krieger was the best one, with a sure pop sense. What great songs he wrote! Plus his fluid guitar playing was always a highlight. John Densmore, well he certainly gets a B for effort but his patterns were hit or miss.<br /><br />When all is said and done, try dealing with frontmen who are lost in a perpetual \\"Morrison trip\\" and then you will know what I've been through. There are things I miss about the industry and there are things I shall never look back upon with any fondness. I think the Doors, and more to the point, Mr. J. Morrison added an overall negative impact that is still felt in pop music to this day.
B0010X758Q|5.0|By now everyone, for the most part, are at least vaguely familiar with a Vampire Weekend song, if not, all of them. It's a very particular sound of music. You can choose for yourself whether or not it's for you.   Now, I personally love their music. But, I'll only listen to it on vinyl. I'm not a big vinyl fan. I don't have any of my \\"favorite\\" bands on vinyl. I just appreciate the sound some albums bring on vinyl. This album however is my favorite in my collection (that includes original presses of Pink Floyd's The Wall and Dark Side Of The Moon, and the majority of the Led Zeppelin catalog).   I'm not saying that Vampire Weekend's songs or them in general are better than the above bands. Not at all. Ever. But this record sounds just so damn amazing! It brings that extra dimension of music.   I loved this album before I even had a record player. The songs were always somewhere in a mix in the car and so what. I don't listen to any of those mixes anymore. I don't remember half of the bands on most of them.   But my girlfriend bought this album on vinyl when we got our record player and ever since playing it for the first time, it's just only been a \\"record player band\\". I don't listen to them in the car for some reason. I just prefer the sound of it in my house more. Would you rather eat a hot steak? Or a cold steak?   Whatever.   If you like Vampire Weekend and haven't checked them out on vinyl, you should treat yourself and do it. If you like vinyl's and records, I recommend this because it has all the attributes of a good album.
0553801473|3.0|As many others have noted, the first three books in this series are amazing. However, this book and its immediate predecessor are plodding chores. Martin's writings are starting to become reminiscent of Stephen King - they contain some great storytelling, but very little actual story. Overall, fairly disappointing.
6302477751|4.0|I love this short film by Tim Burton. It is amusing, touching and a little dark in just the right amount. The video quality is good, But during the film white letters run at the bottom saying \\"Demo, not for sale, property of Buena Vista Home.\\" I would not have purchased it if I had known that.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I bought all 3 Angry Birds  pay apps and they all have ads.... really ticked off now. Ad free means just that.
1400052181|5.0|This was our first experience to buy books for college on Amazon.  Our experience was Great! Thanks for your help!
B003L77GRO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Dexter, and this item arrived on time and was perfect!I appreciate the quality of your products and your timely deliveries to my door!
B0052WKZZ6|5.0|The mastering error that plagued early releases of this CD appears to be fixed. I received my disk on Sept 12th and can detect no blip. Further, I was stunned by the sound quality. The depth, clarity, and balance of this incredible album made me feel like I was experiencing it for the first time. Fantastic.
0439023513|5.0|I'm so sad this series is over. However, I am so happy with the way it ended. Suzanne Collins, I hope you write another amazing series soon!!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I have not seen this disc yet, but I would hope the movie presented to us is a 2:35 aspect ratio versus a 1:85 as is a lot of other movies given to us by the movie companies.<br />Some of us like the letterbox effect versus the tv set effect.
0439023491|5.0|Sequels often suck. This, however, does anything but suck. I was so hooked on this book while I was reading it, I couldn't even stop thinking about it when I wasn't reading.
B0058A119G|4.0|Much has already been written about this CD so I'm norrowing my comments to the \\"raspy\\" voice occasionally heard on the CD, Ms. Streisand's \\"aging voice.\\"  Truth is, if Ms. Stresand wasn't satisfied with her singing she would have re-recorded it or some electronic juggling would have occurred to make it all \\"perfect\\" (as if that's ever possible).  So, what we hear is EXACTLY what she wanted us to hear; any \\"raspiness\\" isn't weakness in her voice but rather her artistic interpretation and she's obviously happy with it, however it happened.  I find that whatever she does while singing enhances it and makes it uniquely her own.  She is undeniably oh-so-gifted.  I think \\"Something New In My Life\\" is the best track, where she uses her lower register to remarkable effect.  A listener can always relax while Ms. Streisand is singing because every note she sings is EXACTLY the note she intended.  I didn't give the CD five stars only because there's not enough of it!  Still, I'm grateful to have this CD, something new in my life.
0439023521|5.0|Usually, it takes me a few chapters to get hooked on a book. This took me two pages. Great story line, great writing. I have recommended this book to several friends who are addicted now also.
B0042816YK|5.0|I love this movie because I can relate to it from the very beginning. I want to say that I'm not a Julia Roberts fan. And I have found other movies similar to this to be completely disappointing. I understand the feeling of being stuck in a relationship that you've outgrown and wanting to break free. I have watched this movie many times and plan to read the book soon.
B0050XFY4O|2.0|The movie was at best a gay soft core porn.  Its acting was awful, the editing was choppy and story line was artificial.  I never really comment on movies, but before you spend your money, reconsider this one.
0307887898|5.0|Simply put, the book is fantastic.  The other reviewers have, for the most part, done it justice.  So, I'll make this very short: it is worth it's weight in gold alone for the simple fact that it destroys the media-myth-making of the plucky entrepreneur who creates the future on vis-a-vis singular genius and intuition.  If you have any entrepreneurial leanings at all, get it today.
B0015AARJI|4.0|it's great to not be tripping over controller cords, but disappointing to discover belatedly that one needs an additional cable to charge the wireless controller.  why not bundle it?
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I've tried a number of weather apps, and most were either unreliable, truly ugly, or drained the battery. This app is none of those. It has TONs of information, displayed very well with a nice user interface. The widgets are very customizable, except the setting for the Icon type doesn't work on my Acer Iconia tablet, it will make it Photo no matter what I select. I don't really like the weather clock widgets that put the weather type per hour around like a clock and has hands that move around as a desktop widget, but you don't have to use that one. I do like the weather clock in the app that I can go check out, but I have my notification and widget set to load into the 10 day screen. I've found this to be much more accurate (even in my rural neighborhood) than any other app as well.    Developers, why am I not giving you 5 stars? Because of the notifications. A notification of this type would be much better as an ongoing notification, i.e. a sticky notification. It constantly scrolling the cloud cover up there on my phone or in the tray of my tablet gets annoying. I expect that it is doing that because it is being updated, but it would just be a nicer implementation if it was up there as a sticky. I love that it has the temp easy to read even when my phone is locked!    Cheers
B005ISQEF4|4.0|TJ lost his mother and with a distant father popping pills he hasn't gotten over his grief.<br /><br />He meets Hesher who turns his life, his family life and his emotional state upside down and inside out. I was mesmerized by Levitt's performance and truly believed Hesher did exsist through Levitt's portrayal.<br /><br />I highly recommend and will be watching this again!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|When I first heard about Thor after it was announced to be adapted to the big screen, I was skeptical. If you look at the character on paper, that is, in the comic books, he is quite ridiculous looking. However, after taking a step back and realizing that Thor is part of a bigger picture, and that Marvel Studios intended to unite several superheros into one story, The Avengers, I knew that they couldn't possibly get this one wrong. They didn't - Thor was dazzling and wildly entertaining. The CGI and special effects are some of the best ever put on screen. Asgard looks incredible, the costumes, set pieces, weapons, Frost Giants, all amazing. In my opinion, the film was also well cast. Chris Hemsworth tackles both jobs of being physically imposing as well as capturing Thor's personality. Tom Hiddleston really stole the show, however, with his take on Loki. I was really impressed with his performance, more so than the rest of the cast. I think he has done one of the best villains ever! This is a great film for fans of action, special effect, comic books, or the like. I love how the studio is tying all the stories together for next summer's superhero team-up, The Avengers. This movie also looks incredible on Blu-Ray, definitely one that will show off what your HDTV is capable of.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The blu ray set of \\"Star Wars\\" was released today in Spain and some other countries. As many of you, I just couldn't wait to go and get it. The package is nicely presented, relatively slim for 9 disks, which is nice. The sound is awsome and the image, simply breath-taking. Barely grainy even in the oldest movies, but not too heavy on the DNR either; very, very well balanced indeed. Colors are saturated and the contrast is vivid, with deep blacks and glowing whites. Just like watching them all anew.  Now, for those of you who may be concerned about this: yes, Darth Vader now cries \\"nooo\\" twice when he takes the emperor at the very end of the saga, in episode VI. Incidentally, he also does in the Spanish dubbed version. I don't like it very much, but it is not too bad either. Anyway, I guess it is just a matter of \\"take it or leave it\\", so, that's it. You may want to complain to LucasFilm about too many changing over and over, just to let them know that not anything goes. Other than that, just sit, relax, and enjoy!!
0062112430|5.0|Procurement<br />I received this ARC while attending BEA 2010.<br /><br />My Grade<br />Plot: 5<br />Setting: 5<br />Writing: 5<br />Originality: 5<br />Characters: 5<br />Romance: 5<br />Overall: 30/30! Perfect!<br />Cover/Title Bonus: 4<br /><br />Overall<br />A brutal society where love is disguised as a disease and is ultimately tragically and beautifully worth fighting for.<br /><br />First Line<br />It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure.<br /><br />Most Memorable Scene<br />During one of the raids an ass of an enforcer encounters a barking dog. Lena handles the situation as best as she could but it still hit a nerve with me as an animal lover.<br /><br />Also, Lena and Alex visit the insane asylum, or prison, and that entire situation had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Plot<br />Love as a disease? I've always been a fan of dystopian societies and this book proved to me why that is. They all have something you're not allowed or supposed to have but ultimately you find a way to want it and grasp it and if you're lucky keep it.<br /><br />Delirium portrays Lena as a young girl about to meet her life partner (I can't remember if there's a specific term used or not) and about to get her treatment against the delirium, love sickness.<br /><br />Every aspect of the plot was meshed together perfectly. I love that there was more to it then just the love story.<br /><br />Setting<br />Lena's world is a pretty brutal place. A required treatment to inhibit the ability to fall in love or feel anything remotely like love or hate is one of the ultimate free will abilities humans have.<br /><br />There's a citizen curfew and required badges or identification cards. Periodically there are raids to search homes.<br /><br />Writing<br />This was the first book by Lauren Oliver I've read. I did try to read Before I Fall but I just couldn't make my way through it. This book is written awesomely. I love that it was written from Lena's point of view. I love the detail that was given to her feelings and her surroundings.<br /><br />Originality<br />Again, love as a disease? Pure originality.<br /><br />Characters<br />Lena doesn't plan to fall in love or even rethink her governments plans for controlling their citizens. I like it when characters surprise themselves; learn more about themselves.<br /><br />Hana is Lena's best friend. She isn't too exposed as a character but we grasp her as the pretty, popular one.<br /><br />My awful secret is that I like to run with Hana partly because it's the single, sole, solitary shred of a thing that I can do better than she can, but I would never admit that out loud in a million years. - page 47 - ARC edition<br /><br />Lena and Hana run quite a bit together. This is one of the most important events of the entire story. Hana is also quite the rowdy one.<br /><br />Lena and Hana both meet Alex while exploring the back of one of the government buildings while on a late afternoon jog. He's a guard. But oh so much more. Alex's character is awesome.<br /><br />Romance<br />Lena and Alex are amazing together. They cover so much territory in such a short amount of time. Ninety-five days of one amazing love. One could almost be happy about that. Except, you can't because you want to hold on to that forever. But what are your options when treatment day comes?<br /><br />Cover/Title Bonus<br />The ARC cover is a bit too meek for my tastes but it fits fine. The title is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />The final cover does not appeal to me at all. I'd much prefer the ARC edition.<br /><br />Ending<br />One of the most touching endings I've ever read. I was so torn to see it end. I read this May 30 - 31, 2010. This doesn't even come out until February 1, 2011 and who knows when the next book will be out. I have so long to wait to see how this will continue.<br /><br />Series<br />The next two book titles are already on Goodreads.<br /><br />Pandemonium - publishing sometime in 2012<br /><br />Requiem - publishing sometime in 2013<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who loves dystopias or rebellious teens. :)
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia was a favorite among my sons when they were little, and I am now purchasing it for my grandson!  It is a great way to introduce classical music, and the images and interpretations are beautiful.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Never even imagined this could be done with a movie, I was blindsided     Wicked! The most encompassing multi-perspective pyschological experience I've ever had. David Webb Peoples adroitly exposes the cunning ways of evil, but it took a skillful director and powerful acting to keep the ridiculous Will Munny from being exposed for the completely selfish summation-of-all-stupidity he is. When watching \\"Unforgiven\\" be wise, be vigilant, and be wary of the company you keep or you get snakebit. This is no ordinary movie from the Hollywood mill; you must pay attention from the moment you see the solitary figure digging a grave under that tree until the moment the solitary figure returns in victory to stand over the grave under that stupid tree.  Now, if you get yourself snakebit, and your vision gets all blurred , and you don't know what you saw, look upon the Word to clear your vision, so you don't trip and fall into a grave.     This movie has been classified as a Cowboy Western because it has cowboys and they carry guns, and as such it is excellent. But, it's also a morality play ending tragically when the flawed hero dies. What is his blind spot? Where is the wisdom in this apparently nihilistic movie? David Webb Peoples has a wicked talent for wrapping a mystery within the facts presented upfront and repetitively. When the mysteries of this movie are solved every scene adds meaning. Even the character's names and the cursed guns Will Munny uses to kill reveal something. A major theme of \\"Unforgiven\\" is immorality and immoral uses of money serving a will-to-power, thus Will Munny. David Webb Peoples loads up his story with moral themes overflowing, and then demonstrates something essential about perception.       When it comes to physcological thrillers, the \\"The Crying Game\\" is a distant second to \\"Unforgiven.\\" The physcological effects on audiences are more insidious. Discombobulated critics babble on about deconstructing western mythology, reconstructionist history, yada yada yada... and totally miss the simple old fashion moral wisdom of this movie. Slipping through moral defenses at their weakest points, the author manages to overcome the judgment faculties of a viewer's mind more effectively than alcohol and lust. Once that's accomplished, he's able to mask the lying murdering no-good evil enemy, Will Munny, as the downtrodden vulnerable underdog protagonist, and mask the tragically flawed hero, Little Bill, as the fascist pig antagonist beating and kicking famous murderers who show up in his town to murder. This movie is almost too funny to be credible, but Peoples and Eastwood managed to keep their experiment from blowing up their careers. If you can't discern the good from the evil, than you're left with a blinding fog of nihilism, and you are completely oblivious to the fundamental and recurring theme, a crescendo rising to a prophetic blast from Gabriel's trumpet; good men are warped, weakened, and destroyed by evil associations.  The innocent either understand this movie or hate it for its creepy and subtle disorientating duplicity and misdirection: a funhouse affect. The way this movie digs itself into a viewer's mind to warp his perception reminds me of the \\"Ring;\\" really creepy and considering the social implications, \\"Unforgiven\\" reaches the apex of horror. Have you seen zombie flicks? Well, \\"Unforgiven\\" is a successful demonstration of mind warping control over the walking dead, who christians call unforgiven. Until EWTN showed me the way, I was one of the walking dead, recognizing stupid but blind to wisdom.      \\"Unforgiven\\" is as much of a comment on current day control of the masses by the various forms of media as it is a significant comment on moral ambiguity. The two subjects are related, because the enemy first appears at the open door, something always fills a vacuum, and nihilists place their faith in and seek answers from victorious strongmen who in turn look upon people as mere objects upon which they exercise and demonstrate their power. Never ridicule Nietzsche style self-willed ubermensches about the ultimate smallness of their power or \\"they will turn and tear you,\\" which is the full extent of their power.     Western expansion may have been driven by a desire to escape control by others, but run as far as they may, men carry the seeds of their destruction with them; reminds me of the Edgar Allan Poe story,\\"Masque of the Red Death.\\" \\"Unforgiven\\" is epic in its scope, and once understood the viewer finds many pearls of wisdom. I'm not going to write a book here, but I will refer you to the bible and the catechism of the catholic church; good vaccinations against evil.     The author concludes with a riddle concerning Mrs. Ansonia Feathers, that is worthy of a sphinx, in which you'll find the raison d'etre of the movie. We now know all too intimately. A fitting end to a funhouse ride. Clever.      Enjoy the experience and savor all the fine details of a rooting-tooting philosophical shoot-out, but caution: be wise, vigilant, and wary of who you ride with, partner. Happy trails.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This show is absolutely fantastic. I can't believe I'm saying it, but it was actually better than the original season of Spartacus: Blood and Sand. And the Blu Ray looks amazing!!!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a very clever and challenging puzzle game. I can not stop playing it. Perfect as a quick, on the go time waster.
030746363X|5.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed reading this book. I didn't read the whole thing... it's a little on the long side. But I took a few key elements out of it and applied them to my everyday life. I'm really liking my new diet and workout regimen, and I couldn't be happier. Another great book from Tim Ferriss.
0240815807|5.0|I have found more wisdom and practical advice about mixing in a home studio in this book than anywhere else! If you are a DIY, self educated, always struggling with technical issues, musician/engineer/producer ...like me! this book is for you. From the first pages you will find yourself saying \\"that's why!\\" and many answers to a lot of common mixing problems in the home studio environment... I specially like the fact that the author gets into every stage of the mixing process with great detail, practical advice and provides you with extra online support... Great book! Worth buying and specially READING it!!
B000007NYS|5.0|I found this in a thrift store! A thrift store!!! Something about that is very appropriate for this rootsy, unpretentious music... I took my mother to a Goodwill because that's her addiction... glancing over I saw \\"Lucinda Williams\\" sitting there on a random shelf... knowing it was out of print, my first thought was \\"JACKPOT!!!\\" and my second thought was \\"Really? Who would POSSIBLY get rid of this CD???\\" - I figured it wasn't an intentional thing... but it was definitely intentional that this CD came to me.<br /><br />Gorgeous. Stripped. Real. Haunting. Gut-level. Brilliant. Honest. Just go get it... used if need be. They just don't make 'em like this any more...
0240815807|5.0|For the last 15 years i have been mixing (even having modest Radio play on some music)  ..in the last 2 years I have been doing some very serious study to upgrade my skills to  really match major league efforts.    After devouring almost everything available (via video,dvd,blogs,magazine article,fellow professional consultation etc.) ...I can honestly say Mike Senior's book is the definitive book on the subject.    In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if music colleges around the world adopted this book into their curriculum.    He writes in a pleasant lucid manner,explaining things in layman terms and has excellent resources on his website.    On top of this, after emailing him having some problem with my mixing setup (I am incorporating Vrm box in my monitoring system)he wrote me back within a few hours telling me he would have some new material covering my question on his website very soon!    I am extremely impressed, to say the least.    This book spills the goods on how things are really done to get that major label 'sound'  without breaking the bank.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|I did not hold much hope after the recent superhero failures but I was very entertained by this movie.    Being honest I'm not a fan of Portman, however Chris Hemsworth plays Thor well and makes this worth watching.  My rating of 3 would be 4 but Portman's acting as usual drags it down one, too bad her best work was in Leon at the age of 13.    Certainly one of the better superhero movies and worth adding to your collection or at least renting.
0553801473|2.0|The title about sums it up.  The book was alright, I don't forsee myself rereading it like I did the others.<br />Some spoilers<br /><br />I picked up the series just as AFFC came out, not realizing it would be a 7 book series.  Devoured the first four books (I even liked book 4, despite many people not) and recommended it to all my friends.  They also immensely enjoyed it and we all eagerly awaited book 5, which kept getting delayed and delayed and delayed.<br /><br />I knew this book would not live up to 6 years of expectations and I wasn't really expecting it to.  But I was still surprised how far off the mark it was.<br /><br />The most disappointing things<br /><br />1) Lack of editing.  The first four books seemed to be somewhat well constructed, at least compared to this.  I found numerous typos.  Additionally, the use of certain catchphrases (s)he was not wrong, words are wind, little and less, much and more, reek reek rhymes with etc. are repeated so much that they actually ruin the immersion.  Add to that the pages upon pages of excessive description of things totally irrelevant to the story, food, side character descriptions etc and you have a whole lot of catchphrase, description, catchphrase, description segments that really break the flow of the story.<br /><br />2) Plot lines going nowhere.  Basically as said in many reviews, nothing actually happened in this book.  Sure a lot of pointless stuff happened, but almost none of it will have an effect on the overall storyline.  The actual things that did happen in the plot line are mostly useless as well.  As an example: Aegon Targaryen the child of Rhaegar found, which would mean he is the rightful heir to the throne not Dany, yet she has a dozen or so chapters and he has none.<br /><br />3) Ridiculous character perspective disparity.  There are too many Tyrion, Dany, Jon parts in this book, which coincidentally are probably the least interesting perspectives.  Bran, Asha, Davos, Arya have a couple.  Rickon has 0, Cersei 2, Jamie 1, Mellisandre 1.  The other books had great balance and I didn't find myself saying oh not a Tyrion, Dany, Jon part again.<br /><br />Overall there was just nothing special about this book.  If you are invested in the series already then I would wait for the Library rush to be over and get it from there.on has 0, Cersei 2, Jamie 1, Mellisandre 1.

0240815807|5.0|Mixing Secrets is without question the best book on the subject of mixing that I've found. Mike Senior has been writing the well-liked \\"Mix Rescue\\" column in Sound On Sound magazine since 2006, so he's an expert at taking a sometimes lackluster recording and crafting it into a mix that's something far greater than what it was before. With all of that experience comes a wealth of practical knowledge on mixing. Some of the many highlights of this book include his lengthy discussion of monitoring, mix preparation (the work you should do BEFORE you mix), how to achieve a balance in your mix using dynamics processing and EQ, and sweetening with effects.     Mike also writes with a very humorous and entertaining style that constantly reminds you that mixing is fun! You're not reading a textbook here. He also includes a \\"Cut to the Chase\\" section at the end of each chapter that sums up the most important points, and gives you an assignment for that chapter, so you'll have some homework to do (did I say this wasn't a textbook?).     In conclusion, this is the book that I WISH I had when I first started recording and mixing. If you're new to mixing, get this book. If you're not new to mixing, get this book--you'll still learn a lot.

B004FQX5CK|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet:  Blade Runner is one of my absolute favorite movies, if not my number one pick.  The Final Cut is the definitive version of the film, as it doesn't have the tacked-on (and horribly cheesy) ending, nor Harrison Ford's lazy, tiresome voiceover.  This film stands on its own, and if you haven't seen Blade Runner before, this is absolutely the version to get.  Superb on every level imaginable.<br /><br />This particular transfer is as good as we're ever going to get.  It's got some minor flaws here and there (particularly with some bits of uncompressed audio), but the messy production that plagued this film from its very inception is primarily to blame.  In this case, its the film's imperfections that give it so much charm.<br /><br />If you only have a stereo system, this Blu-ray won't murder your ears.  The Dolby TrueHD audio track sounds great on stereo speakers.  I wanted to point this out, because I know a lot of people don't have 5.1 surround sound systems, and unfortunately a majority of Blu-rays lack a stereo track, so the movie becomes a bit odd to watch.  This is not the case with Blade Runner, so purchase away!<br /><br />For the big fans or the collectors out there, keep in mind that this Blu-ray I'm reviewing is the single-disc version.  You will not get the 'Dangerous Days' documentary that tends to be so revered in the community.  If you're interested in that, the DVD multi-disc version is cheap, and you won't be missing out on quality.  If this were a two-disc release, the second disc with said documentary would actually be on an ordinary DVD, not a Blu-ray disc.

0307887898|5.0|Eric's work on the Lean Startup is already transforming how companies think about delivering value to customers. He's given a great frame to help the team focus on what actually matters most: validated learning. It's also a very light and engaging read, full of stories that help to illustrate the ideas and make them tangible and actionable. It's a great airplane read, too.
0375842209|5.0|One of the most memorable works I have read in a long time!  Don't let its classification as \\"young adult\\" fool you.  It is a beautiful piece of prose narrated by an unusual character suited to an \\"adult\\" audience!  My book club members, all of whom are of \\"a certain age\\" raved about this one...Can't recommend it enough!!!!!
B0000BZNIU|1.0|I have ordered multiple items from Amazon and have never had a problem with any of the items I've purchased until now.  This \\"Office Space\\" DVD will not play in either of my DVD players.

B000TXG3YA|4.0|Baroness are an exciting sludge, stoner and prog influenced metal band from Virginia USA who play a straightforward and enjoyable version of music of which Mastodon, Kylessa, High On Fire and even Isis and Neurosis share similarities, although all on vastly varying ends of the spectrum, some largely in guitar style and tone and some on only the mildest surface similarities. If you are a fan of any of those bands or just that general area of the genre, then check out Baroness, it won't sound like another album from one of the aforementioned bands but it is very likely the type music that you'd enjoy.<br /><br />Red Album is their debut full length studio album, released in 2007 and consisting of roughly an hour's worth of material at a mix of tempos, styles and degrees of heaviness. Highlights include the absolutely fantastic `Teeth Of A Cogwheel,' which everyone curious about the band should try out, as well as the album opener `Rays On Pinnion,' the single `Wanderlust,' and the slow album closing instrumental `Grad.'<br /><br />The album is produced well and the songwriting is pretty solid throughout. From almost every angle you look at it, Red Album is just a straight up excellent record, although perhaps they are missing some indefinable dynamic factor that would elevate it to classic status.<br /><br />Overall; Red Album is a very good and well written album, enjoyable to listen to and that ticks a lot of the right boxes. They aren't the most progressive prog band, the sludgiest sludge band or the most metal metal band out there, and fans expecting one extreme or another may be disapointed, however Baroness do provide a fine mixture of the styles well, with an interesting and enjoyable set of songs that you should give a fair chance to if you like this type of music.
0307655105|5.0|This book is absolutely perfect for toddlers who are excited about exploring their world. My daughter (almost 2) has loved this book since we first brought it home. The scenes are varied and interesting as well as colorful. Since we have been reading it with her she can now recognize all kinds of things we've seen in the book- firetrucks, police cars, every kind of boat imaginable, playground equipment and activities, and all the different parts of the morning routine (thank you, Kenny Bear). The only problem is that she can rip the pages, since they are paper, but that's a small price to pay.
0439023521|5.0|This entire series is fantastic! The books were creative and completely absorbing.  Best series I've read in many, many years!
0062060554|2.0|I purchased this \\"psychological thriller\\" on Kindle.  What a mess... and a waste of time.  I did not find this book to be as inventive and thrilling as the majority of reviewers on Amazon.  Instead, I found it to be unrealistic, predictable, and oh-so-boring.      Just a few things (off the top of my head) that were awfully irksome and distracting about this allegedly thrilling ride: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT--MOVE ON TO THE NEXT REVIEW IF YOU PLAN TO READ THIS NOVEL    1- I just could not in my mind suspend the norms of human nature and human interaction sufficient to go along with what the author was selling.  Who wakes up beliving they are 20-something, learns they are actually 50-something, married, the victim of an accident, etc., and THEN does anything other than shut down for the remainder of the day?  The protagonist in this book; that's who.  Daily -- she's learning and re-learning to use cell phones when they did not exist as far as she can remember.  She's meeting strangers -- sometimes 2 in a day.  She's bringing herself to go on trips and considering having sex with someone who is basically a stranger.      2- More on the unbelievable aspect of the book:  COME ON.  She's reading an increasingly lengthy journal jam packed with really important, painful, and shocking details about her life daily?  And then she's turning around and writing what amounts to a short story with perfect grammar, every single day for weeks?     3- Even more... Her incredibly loving husband who would do anything for her decides not to check in on her for months, allowing a psychopath to play house with her during that time.  The son doesn't give a rat's arse either for a few months.  But of course they will stand by their wife and mother respectively in the end and they will live happily ever after.      4- She remembers one image of Claire or Adam and she knows exactly who they are and how she feels about them.  Claire is decidly her best friend after that one memory about the party,for example.  In contrast, she remembers a detailed interlude with the fake \\"Ben\\" in her old home... yet she conveniently does not remember that she is TERRIFIED TO DEATH OF HIM.      5- Super lazy ending.  The laziest I have read in a long time.  In the last 30 pages I believe we have a shocking revelation, a fight to the death, a rescue, reconcilliation, and a recap of what was happening in the world outside of the main character's perspective.  Oh yea; and the main character falls asleep in the end at peace with her new life.  Barf.      I could go on and on... Really I could.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Another vampire movie?  Look again.  This is a tragic love story of significant emotional impact. The main characters, Eli and Oskar, combine innocence, maturity, knowledge, violent behavior, touching tenderness, and deep feeling for each other.  They are literally willing to shed their blood for each other.  The sadness felt by the viewer(or reader of the fuller novel) arises from his or her awareness of their tragic future.  Theirs is a love doomed, being unfullfillable sexually and in other normal ways.  Despite this fact, they must remain together because their need for each other depends on their survival. Yes, even in a sense, for Oskar. Will Oskar become another Hakan? We are chilled to consider that. But what is the alternative?  Such is the tragedy.    Eli's story, as related in the novel, is one of sorrow. There is great poignancy in the meeting of these two.  They fall into each other's lives at the most necessary time for both.    The performances of both children are outstanding.  Lina Leanderssons's Eli is a performance of heartbreaking naturalness.  Such \\"performances\\" can probably never occur again as the actor gains in experience and self awareness.  It is a rare thing to behold.  The soundtrack by Soderqvist perfectly expresses this atmosphere of innocence, tenderness, tragedy and foreboding all at once. Eli's theme, with its variations and the use of the acoustic guitar, is one of great melodic beauty.  The cinematography is equally enhancing.  The chill,white cold of the setting wonderfully supports the tragic theme.    Is it silly to posit such meaning in a work of popular art, especially in one of such a base genre?  Perhaps.  But sometimes we find deep meaning and emotional resonance in surprising places.  I feel this is one. Ultimately it is the viewer or reader that is the key, bringing with him his personal experiences and personality in judging a work of art.  We should acknowledge that the artist can use any vehicle  to create and realizehis view of the nature of life. We should not denigrate any form this conception takes but only ask that it succeeds.  In my opinion \\"Let The Right One In\\" as cinema and novel thoroughly transcends the form of \\" vampire story\\".

B003LQMZS0|5.0|My daughter is 4 months old and adores this giraffe.  He's probably one of her favorites.  It holds up well in the wash - just keep in mind that throwing it in the dryer will ruin the mirror.  If your child likes the crinkle noise, the underside of this is crinkle.
0061537969|5.0|A friend gave me this book as she knew I was a dog lover.  She read parts of it before giving it to me and she said that Enzo reminded her of my dog Inga, now deceased.  I loved this book!  My only regret is that I cannot have the joy of reading it for the first time.  The race car driver theme was wonderful and very accurate (I love Formula One, as well).  I can't say enough good things about this book.....it wasn't a total tear-jerker and gave the dog dignity.
1402770006|3.0|This graphic novel adaptation of one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes cases was a bit sloppy with its reconstructed storyline and even with my familiarity of the tale and characters left me a bit confused at times.  On the flip-side I.N.J. Culbard's presents a nice, minimalist style that goes well with the narrative and manages to properly evoke the gloomy atmosphere of the setting.  This edition also presents a few goodies at the end with character concept sketches, floor plans, alternative covers and a quick 4-page preview of their next Sherlock adaption - \\"A Study in Scarlet.\\"
1401310400|4.0|I guess anyone buying this will be a fan of Castle and buying it for the novelty factor, and with that in mind I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! It's like reading a double episode. Well paced, plenty of suspects, sexual tension and the plot doesn't drag. It's a fun read and  well written by someone I assume is a writer of the show because the humor is the same. The paperback is small enough to fit in your bag or front pocket of your cargos, a great read on the go!    One word of warning, the paperback has smaller font than usual, maybe get the hardcover if you will have issues with that.

If you look on your writing as an art, then stay away. This book is serious about developing a fan base and giving them more of what they want. Very clever and bursting with good advice. He uses social media as a very effective tool to communicate with his fan base. I love his sense of humour and his rebellious approach to publishing. Go John!!
1451629184|5.0|The title for this book is entirely accurate.  I am truly touched by the courage of Jaycee Dugard.  I am also infinitely saddened by her story.   She recounts her abduction and her experiences in a very simple way, which is why the book is so powerful.  We hear alarming stories of abducted children, many who are never seen or heard from again...Jaycee uses her voice and words to let us into her horrendous experience with a simplicity that is poignant and heartbreaking.  Brave, courageous, truthful.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Long time Stephen king fan, horribly disappointed, he always talks about how critics say he sells out and I never thought he did.  Until now.
0451169514|5.0|I read 6 or 7 novels by Stephen King, disliked \\"The Shining\\" (but love the Jack Nicholson movie), liked \\"Misery\\" (but like the movie even more), but IMO \\"It\\" is his masterpiece.<br /><br />This book delighted me on more than one level. It's scary, yes, but it also has to offer a lot for movie buffs and people who love music from the fifties and sixties.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed and it's fascinating to read about their lives.<br />I hardly read a book with so many pages that never got boring. This is a fast read!<br /><br />Now I'm looking forward to the next Stephen King book about JFK & time travel to be published...

159420229X|4.0|The author created a book that should appear in the self-help and non-fiction isles of the library.  It could fit right beside the other documentaries.  There is also space for it on the shelf with autobiographies and considering the amount of history covered by this book, it might be welcome in that part of the library too.  I think the author was undecided about what type of a book he wanted to write, or perhaps he was just giving us our moneys worth, but somehow he has beat the odds and has been successful in creating a great book.      Joshua Foer takes the reader on a journey from the time he was amazed while covering a memory competition as a journalist, to the point where he is personally involved as a major contender in the competition.  He spends some time developing the other competitors as characters (they are that) by describing their personalities, appearances, antics and their approach to memorization.  He also writes about overcoming some of the typical barriers that people encounter during any endeavour requiring extended periods of training but his description of the hurdles and his approach to successfully overcoming them makes his account interesting and worth reading.    Moonwalking with Einstein is not an instruction manual on how to do memory gymnastics but it does introduce the reader to the fact that these feats can be accomplished without any innate natural talent.  The people who are practicing memorization at this level are mostly utilizing techniques that take advantage of the minds natural strength at memorizing pictures while minimizing the need to retain digits and other items which it is less well suited to remember. The techniques for developing a super memory are presented but not taught in any detail by this book.      This book brings to light that the extreme memorization that is its subject, was no great feat in the past.  People in ancient times easily memorized things out of necessity and the current techniques are mostly reincarnations of methods used centuries ago.      This is a fun and interesting read.  I believe that when you have completed this book you will not only have been entertained by the authors clever writing but you will have also learned something of value.  I suggest this book for anyone.
